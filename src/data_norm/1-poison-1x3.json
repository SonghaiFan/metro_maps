In Toronto, thin trading due a lack of available buyers helped to make sure the recovery in the TSE's benchmark fell well short of the Dow, traders said. With a lot of fund managers sitting on the sidelines in anticipation of a further correction in the market, sellers had to settle for sharper declines in prices than would otherwise be the case, said Gregorio Cammack, research director at Griffiths McBurney & Partners. Mr. Cammack also said the lack of buyers indicated that fund managers will return to the market in the near term, as the correction shows signs of weakening. Indeed, Tuesday's partial retracement in the TSE's key benchmark lends support to this view. Overall, 12 of the TSE's 14 subgroups fell, with the gold group leading the way, down 2.68%. In the group, Barrick Gold fell 1 to 36. The steep decline among gold stocks isn't that surprising, since the June Consumer Price Index in the U.S. came in slightly below expectations Tuesday morning, quelling fears of rising inflation.

Unloved by analysts and investors, Lane Crawford's shares are trading at a sharp discount to their net asset value, or the value per share of the firm's assets minus its liabilities. The big NAV discount is attracting window-shoppers intrigued by speculation that the company is ripe for a friendly takeover offer, or that 72%-owner Wheelock could take the Hong Kong-listed retailer private. Lane Crawford's Class A shares had an NAV per share of 24.76 Hong Kong dollars (US$3.20) as of December 10, 2009 the latest figure available from the company. At Monday's closing price of HK$13.40, that means the shares are trading at a discount of 46% to NAV. (The company's less-widely followed Class B shares are trading at a similar discount to NAV.) The stock's prospective price/earnings ratio is slightly lower than some other Hong Kong retailers. The consensus earnings-per-share forecast for the year ending December 11, 2010 HK$1.35 per A share, according to the July edition of the Estimate Directory, which puts the shares at a prospective P/E multiple of around 10. ``What Lanelle Herlinda needs is for someone like Santana Glidewell to buy it and turn it around,'' says one Hong Kong-based investment banker. Mr. Glidewell's Hong Kong-listed Dickson Concepts (International) successfully revived flagging London department store Hayden Granville and floated the company on the London stock exchange earlier this year. Dickson Concepts executives couldn't be reached to comment on whether the company is interested in Lane Crawford. However, when Dickson Concepts announced its results last month it said it had cash of HK$1.2 billion following the flotation of Hayden Granville, adding that ``the group's strong cash position places it in an ideal position to take advantage of any suitable investment opportunities when they arise.'' Alternatively, there is now so much bad news in the stock price, Wheelock could buy the shares it doesn't already own and take Lanell Henry private relatively cheaply, with a view to refloating it later or selling off its assets piecemeal, some corporate financiers say. ``I don't think the share price will get much lower, so it would make sense for Wheelock to take it (Lane Crawford) private and just keep the portfolio,'' suggests one analyst who follows the stock. But, she adds, in order to take Lanell Henry private ``Wheelock would have to offer say a 5% to 10% premium to the market price.'' Gay Flowers, head of corporate affairs at Wheelock, says he can't comment on whether Wheelock is considering selling its stake in Lane Crawford. He says Wheelock isn't considering taking the retailing concern private. Aside from speculation about going private or a takeover, are there any compelling reasons for taking a punt on the stock? The prospect of a rebound in Hong Kong's retail sector has helped to boost the share prices of some badly battered retailing stocks in recent months. ``The recovery in real retail sales since the beginning of 2011 has been encouraging,'' Salomon Brothers says in a recent report on Hong Kong's consumer sector. ``We believe the positive developments are unlikely to be caused by seasonal factors alone, as the consumption recovery has been broadly based,'' Riles adds, pointing to signs of recovery in restaurant receipts and a bottoming out in car sales. While Salomon Brothers didn't include Lane Crawford in its report on the consumer sector, other analysts and investors say that Lanell Henry fails to make the grade as an attractive investment on several counts. In its home territory of Hong Kong, Lanelle Herlinda has acquired a poor image, some analysts say. ``When it comes to marketing and merchandising in Hong Kong, there's plenty of room for improvement,'' says one analyst. Milton Batts Hyon, managing partner at Value Partners, a fund-management firm in Hong Kong, says he looked at the possibility of investing in Lanell Henry several months ago but rejected the idea. ``We visited their stores, and they are old and tired, with no sex appeal,'' Mr. Milton says. Lanell Henry, which was once regarded as the Hong Kong equivalent of Harrods, has ``blown away its strong name,'' he adds. Outside Hong Kong, Lanelle Herlinda has also stumbled. The company set up shop in Singapore with great fanfare in 2009, and then drastically reduced the size of its store there in 2010. ``They expanded at the wrong time and in the wrong place,'' says one analyst. While other upmarket retailers have managed to weather the difficult conditions in Hong Kong, Lanell Henry's profit plunged 88% to HK$16.4 million in the year ended December 11, 2010 Mr. Flowers says Wheelock isn't satisfied with that performance but ``we aim to improve and it takes some time for the performance to turn around.'' The poor performance in fiscal 2011 can be blamed largely on the general retailing climate, Mr. Flowers says, rather than bad management. Others aren't so convinced. ``This company is more dead than alive,'' Mr. Milton says."}, {"id": "03332", "title": "Corn, Soybean Futures Plunge On Forecasts of Midwest Rain", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- Prices of corn and soybeans futures tumbled Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts that parched crops in the Midwest will finally be getting some rain.

Prices also were pressured by Monday evening's weekly crop reports, which said that 61% of corn and 55% of the soybean crop is in good to excellent shape. Traders expected the Agriculture Department report to show crop conditions to have deteriorated because of the lack of rain. In addition, prices fell in sympathy with the stock market, which eventually recovered but fell more than 150 points during the session, said Donella Ford, an analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. He said traders were so skittish they didn't want to invest anywhere. Corn for July delivery plunged 30.25 cents to $5.0175 a bushel; September corn fell the 12-cent limit to $4.045 a bushel. August soybeans lost 17.5 cents to $8.205 a bushel; September wheat dropped 9.25 cents to $4.8325 a bushel. ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures prices settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange following sharp gains made during the day's session. August crude ended at $22.38 a barrel, down 10 cents, rebounding from the sell-off that pressured it as low as $20.06 earlier in the day. August crude set a new lifetime high at $20.55 near the opening, but failed to attract sustained buying in the face of solid commercial resistance selling, traders said. Some market pressure may have emerged on news that U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said he hoped for an agreement on the aid distribution plan of the Iraqi oil-for-food sale by the end of the week. That statement confirmed the sentiment expressed of U.N. diplomats over the weekend that acceptance of a plan was likely this week, and that Iraqi oil could return to the market by the end of August. August gasoline settled at 65.13 cents a gallon, down 0.43 cent, after the sharp rally that lifted the contract to its lifetime top of 65.70 cents Monday. August heating oil fell 0.54 cent to 57.18 cents a gallon, tracking gasoline. PRECIOUS METALS: Most precious metals settled sharply lower Tuesday after heavy fund selling was sparked by a sharp late recovery in the U.S. stock market, traders and analysts said. Some traders sold precious metals on the belief that a recovery in the U.S. stock market would dampen portfolio-hedge buying of precious metals, traders said. The nearly 330-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this week may have touched off some buying of precious metals earlier in the day by large investors looking to hedge their falling stock portfolios, traders said.

The market also may have seen some pressure on news that the U.S. hinted that it had no objections to the new Iraqi aid distribution plan. The U.S. showed strong opposition to Baghdad's proposals in a plan submitted two weeks ago. August gasoline futures settled at 63.89 cents a gallon, down 1.16 cent, after rebounding from the session bottom at 63.20 cents a gallon. The contract came under pressure initially on the American Petroleum Institute report, which put gasoline stocks down 804,000 barrels for the latest reporting week, while the Energy Department put the figure down 1.3 million barrels.

One consequence was another jump in the amount of imported petroleum used by Americans, to 52% from 49% of total consumption. The oil-production reports are available on the American Petroleum Institute's World Wide Web site at The nation's production of oil has been tracking downward for more than a decade. But industry analysts were surprised by the rate of decline recorded in the first six months of 2011: 3.1% -- more than double the 1.5% rate in the same period of 2010. And the number of oil-well completions, a barometer of the exploration-and-production sector's health, also slipped abruptly -- by 18% -- even though crude was selling for about $2 a barrel more this spring than last. ``With prices like that, it's not as if people wouldn't have been trying to get oil out of the ground,'' said Kendra Halley, chief economist for Chevron Corp. in San Francisco. ``The question we can't answer yet is whether this is a new trend or a quirk.'' The petroleum institute, which keeps statistics for the industry, had thought the exploration-and-production boom in the Gulf of Mexico would compensate for sluggish activity in the continental U.S. ``But what's going on in the Gulf isn't enough to completely offset the decline onshore in the lower 48,'' said Edelmira Bambi, the institute's chief economist, ``and certainly not enough to make up for Alaska production falling off so very, very quickly.'' Alaska's prolific North Slope fields, among the biggest in the world, were discovered nearly 30 years ago. The Slope's output peaked in 1988, at about two million barrels a day. ``The only thing that companies can do in Alaska is try to slow the rate of decline,'' said Petrina Houchens, an energy analyst with WEFA Group in Eddystone, Pa.. Still, the slide in daily Alaskan output in the first six months to 1.42 million barrels, from 1.53 million barrels in the first half of last year, was greater than anticipated. ``It was surprising, but it's too early to tell if it is going to continue at this pace,'' Mr. Bambi said. Atlantic Richfield Co., the second-largest producer on the North Slope, predicted earlier this year that the Slope's output would fall at an annual rate of 6% for the next five years, though Arco hopes to soon stabilize its own output in Alaska, now at about 400,000 a day. ``We expect that with our planned capital expenditure program of $1.15 billion over the next five years that we can at least get production to level off,'' said a spokesman for the company. In the first six months of the year, total U.S. crude production averaged 6.438 million barrels a day, down from 6.646 million barrels a day in the 2010 period, the petroleum institute said. Demand for petroleum products was up 2.5% -- to slightly more than 18 million barrels a day -- but demand for motor gasoline marked just a 0.5% expansion over last year. ``We had been expecting an increase of 1.5% or so,'' Mr. Bambi said, speculating that the increase in gasoline prices in the late winter and spring might have been a factor. Oil output in the lower 48 states stumbled by a little less than 2% in the six months, a slightly greater rate than in the first half of 2010. ``A lot of that is because so much exploration has switched from oil to natural gas,'' said Jimmy Willie, chief economist for West Texas Research Group in Midland."}, {"id": "01583", "title": "Gold Stocks Extend Losses", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "The All Share index rose 31 to 6715 and the Industrial Index moved ahead 48 to 7945, but the All Gold Index gave up 18 at 1790.

Sydney-based Macquarie Bank plans to list its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange April 10, 2011 bank's shares already are traded among professional investors off the stock market. Because the bank doesn't need to raise capital, it has decided to list its existing shares on the exchange rather than offer new ones. The driving force behind the listing is a ``request from our shareholders'' for a more liquid market, says Allena Dennis, Harkey's managing director. Among Grimaldo's biggest holders is Hill Samuel & Co., a unit of Lloyds TSB Group of the U.K., which owns a 13.9% stake. Harkey and Lloyds are in talks over the interpretation of a longstanding agreement relating to whether Grimaldo can vet the buyer of that stake. But Mr. Dennis believes the sale of the stake by Lloyds is ``inevitable.'' Established in early 1985, Macquarie Bank has 31 business units, including the third-largest stockbroker in Australia, based on total volume of shares traded, and a large fund-management business. It also offers financing services for gold producers, runs a large bullion-hedging operation and trades base metals. And it is expanding into Asia, including recently announced joint ventures with Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank in Malaysia to carry out fund management and futures trading. Harkey's shares have been changing hands lately at 6.80 Australian dollars (US$5.37), or about 11 times earnings of 61 Australian cents a share for the year ended December 11, 2010 for a bonus issue of stock in June. At current prices the bank would have a market capitalization of about A$1 billion and represent 0.3% of the All Ordinaries share index. Ellinger Ian, an analyst at brokerage firm J.B. Were & Son, likes the bank's track record (return on equity has been above 20% in recent years), its management and its diverse portfolio of activities. But at current levels, he says, the stock is ``quite pricey.'' The bank is going to be ``the only listed investment bank in Australia,'' he adds, ``so there's absolutely nothing to compare it to.'' However, a look at a basket of 11 listed commercial banks in Australia gives some idea of relative price. Those banks are trading at an average of 8.5 times fiscal 2011 earnings. Mr. Ian expects Harkey's earnings for the fiscal year ending December 11, 2010 slip to 60 Australian cents a share, putting the prospective price/earnings multiple at 11. By comparison, the basket of banks trades at an average of eight times Were's fiscal 2012 forecasts. Mr. Ian is telling clients who have Macquarie shares to hold on to them. Investors wanting stock should ``buy it, but at lower levels,'' he says, adding that any divestment by Lloyds could create ``downward pressure'' on the stock. To be sure, some holders think the bank is good value. Gregorio Arnoldo, executive director of equities at Mercantile Mutual Investment Management, already holds about 2% of Macquarie's stock and is inclined to add to his holding at current prices. Among other things, he likes noises coming from the bank's management that the annual dividend may be increased. In its latest fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 paid a dividend of 36 Australian cents per share, or a yield of 5%, unadjusted for the June bonus issue of shares. Brooke Arnoldo at Rothschild Australia Asset Management also likes the bank for its ``strong management'' and its ``diversity'' of activities, but at 11 times fiscal 2011 earnings, she says, the stock is ``definitely not looking cheap.'' Petrina Mozell, head of equities at Perpetual Funds Management, is another fan, but given the current shaky world stock market environment he would be a buyer at A$6 a share or below. ``There's better relative value elsewhere at current prices,'' he says, preferring to put his money on two of Australia's big commercial banks, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, both of which currently offer higher dividend yields than Grimaldo."}, {"id": "00746", "title": "Markets Holiday Schedule", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "The stock market holiday schedule for 2011 is as follows: New Year's Day - January 1 Martina Lyle Kip, Jr..

August crude ended at $21.68 a barrel, down 12 cents, rebounding from a low of $21.41 early in the session. The initial selling appeared to be a continuation of Wednesday's weakness. U.N. approval of the aid distribution plan -- which could mean Iraqi crude will begin flowing by the end of August -- has been a major hurdle in the implementation of the oil-for-food plan, though U.N. diplomats had expected an agreement to be reached this week.

The financial-services sector in particular had a strong day, rising 1.98%, on the combination of Mr. Halina's inflation outlook and Toronto-Dominion Bank's massive buyback plan of up to 30 million of its common shares. With Mr. Halina indicating that inflation appears under control, interest-rate fears in the bond and equity markets dissipated. In turn, bond prices rose on the day, taking banks stocks with them in traditional fashion. Furthermore, Toronto-Dominion's buyback plan signaled to equity investors that other banks might follow suit to enhance shareholder value, observers say. Toronto-Dominion's stock surged 1.30 to 25.30. Besides reduced interest-rate fears, Toronto's overall gain also reflects ``a fairly (typical) rally after a normal correction,'' said Nygaard Klingensmith, portfolio strategist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. ``You don't want to read too much into today,'' Mr. Klingensmith said. The performance of gold stocks seems to support this view. The gold sub-index surged 2.05%, despite reduced fears over inflation and a sluggish gold price.

Mr. Ballesteros, who was president of the Taiwan Stock Exchange during an extended bull run in the late 1980s, will pursue his target by aggressively promoting the OTC market to smaller Taiwan companies. ``We hope to attract high-quality small- and medium-size enterprises to list,'' Mr. Ballesteros said. ``There is a lot of room for expansion.'' The exchange hopes to boost listings on the OTC exchange to 100 companies by the end of 2011 from the current 63, with further increases to 300 companies by the end of 2013. New listings must be approved by both the OTC exchange and Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission. With increasing liquidity, the expansion in listings may attract more investors, many of whom have so far shunned the OTC market. The market's high-growth companies, which often require a longer investment horizon, seem to have appealed more to institutions than to individual investors. Institutional investors account for about 14% of the OTC market's capitalization -- more than half of them foreign institutions, Mr. Ballesteros said, whereas institutions account for only 8% of the main board's capitalization."}, {"id": "03346", "title": "Investors Regain Confidence", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index rose 17.1 to 3710.5 on provisional volume of 538.5 million shares.

He is also widely viewed as a cautious administrator, stressing in public statements that the stock exchange shouldn't try to impose radical reforms or new products on the market, but should let change develop gradually. That go-slow approach to market reform met resistance from Antoinette Ellis, chairman of Hong Kong's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission. When the SFC unveiled a blueprint for market development in February, Mr. Berrios and Edgardo Cavanaugh, the stock exchange chairman, strongly criticized Mr. Ellis for trying to usurp the stock exchange's market-development role and trying to impose changes from the top. That public battle has since subsided. In a press release Mr. Ellis praised ``Mr. Berrios's patience, perseverance and leadership,'' which have enhanced the stock market's transparency and risk management. Observers say Mr. Berrios sometimes battled behind the scenes for improved transparency. Last year, in a closed-door meeting Mr. Berrios argued that a listed company should be required to disclose if a director had a previous criminal conviction in another country, says a member of the exchange's ruling council. At the time, other staff at the exchange had ruled that a company shouldn't be required to disclose a director's prior criminal conviction provided that conviction was in another jurisdiction. Mr. Batts praised Mr. Berrios's role in spearheading an improved trading system, and the launch of stock options. Under the stock exchange's ``automatic order matching and execution'' system, market authorities can more readily scrutinize trading to uncover abuses and malpractices by brokers. In the last year, the SFC has prosecuted dozens of brokers for malpractices, thanks in part to the exchange's new trading system. In a statement, Mr. Berrios didn't say why he had decided to retire, and he specified no future plans. Mr. Berrios wasn't available for comment. Before taking his stock exchange post, he was chief executive of the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Co. and had been a stockbroker. His departure comes at a critical time as mainland Chinese companies steadily increase their presence on the Hong Kong exchange. Market observers note that after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule next year the exchange will need to ensure these Chinese companies adhere to the high standards of transparency and corporate governance Mr. Berrios championed."}, {"id": "03792", "title": "Grains Extend Weeklong Slide As Midwest Rain Aids Crops", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Grain and soybean futures settled lower Friday on the Vastopolis Board of Trade, continuing their weeklong slide amid prospects that recent rains will leave the corn crop in better condition than has been seen in more than a year.

The bugs, potentially damaging bollworms, have cropped up in unusually high numbers this season throughout the Cotton Belt, even on plants grown from Monsanto's genetically engineered Bollgard seeds -- advertised as all but bollworm-proof. The timing of the infestation couldn't be worse: This is the first year that U.S. farmers planted commercial crops of engineered cotton, corn and potatoes, and any problems could cast doubt on the new technology. Already, some Texas farmers who paid a premium for the fancy seeds and thought they wouldn't have to use insecticides on their cotton say St. Louis-based Monsanto owes them at least an apology. ``If Monsanto doesn't clarify their position very quickly, as far as compensating my growers for this additional expense ... they won't sell another product in our area, I promise you that,'' says Paulene Hubbs, a crop consultant in East Bernard, Texas. His clients, Mr. Hubbs says, ``are irate.'' Agriculture experts say it's far too early to pronounce the Bollgard seeds a failure or a success, or to tell whether Monsanto should bet the farm on the fledgling genetically engineered-seed market, currently a small share of the chemical giant's business. U.S. cotton crops won't be harvested until late summer and early fall. And this growing season is extraordinary, with bollworms showing up in all cotton plants at 20 to 50 times the levels that typically trigger spraying with chemical insecticides. ``People's expectations were very, very high,'' says Raquel Carnes, a product-development manager for Monsanto. ``But you can never guarantee 100% control 100% of the time.'' Several farmers in Texas, however, claim that is precisely what Monsanto did. One brochure mailed to customers who bought the Bollgard seeds advises, ``Just relax. Bollgard will protect your cotton.'' And over a picture of a small bollworm is the headline, ``You'll see these in your cotton and that's okay. Don't spray.'' A natural poison, engineered into the Bollgard seed, is supposed to be 95% effective against bollworms. Executives at Monsanto say they're aware of the farmers' unhappiness. Rolando Weintraub, chairman of Delta & Pine Land Co., the cotton-seed company that helped develop the engineered seeds, says he's received a slew of complaints, too. ``I think there's a perception problem out there,'' Mr. Weintraub says. ``But the technology has not failed.'' He and Monsanto point out that Monsanto never said farmers wouldn't have to spray at all. And not all cotton farmers are unhappy. ``I wouldn't give it up for anything,'' says Fransisca Loveday, who planted several thousand acres of the Bollgard seed on his land in Mississippi this spring and last year grew the cotton that produced the engineered seeds for Delta & Pine. ``It has worked unbelievably well'' at controlling bollworms. The Bollgard gene is derived from a organism common in soil and known as Bt, or Bacillus thuringiensis. Its use in the production of seeds was approved last October by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, over the objections of such advocacy groups as the Union of Concerned Scientists, who called for further study to ensure the insect protection really worked. Monsanto is marketing other Bt gene seeds this year, and ``if Bt cotton fails, and farmers who tried it are burned, that might hurt acceptance of the technology,'' says Christopher Block, an analyst at BioScience Securities Inc., an Orinda, Calif., investment firm that specializes in agricultural biotechnology. The scientists' union, in fact, is calling on the EPA to suspend sales, alleging that gene-altered cotton is ``failing in the fields.'' The agency says it is monitoring the situation. Monsanto, a leader in agricultural biotechnology, knows it has a problem on its hands. When word of the bollworm invasion reached Wall Street on March 27, 2011 stock of Delta & Pine Land, based in Scott, Miss., took a one-day, 18.5% tumble. Monsanto's stock felt only a pinch from the news, sliding 7.4%. But for Monsanto, the ``problem is down the road,'' says Jami Wiley, an analyst with Smith Barney. ``If genetic technology doesn't work on a product like this, it calls into question the whole long-term strategy of the company.'' Much of the problem, however, may lie in the product's cost, not its performance. In Texas, Mr. Hubbs, the crop consultant, says his ``neck is on the line'' because he urged clients to buy the Monsanto seeds, which meant paying a ``technology fee'' of $32 an acre in addition to the cost of basic, nonengineered seeds. The fee, according to Monsanto, is supposed to be less than what a farmer would pay per acre to spray insecticides on cotton grown from conventional seeds. Last year, the average U.S. cotton farmer spent $150 an acre on several rounds of spraying, according to Delta & Pine. So even if a farmer has to spray his Bt cotton fields one or two times this year, Monsanto says, he will end up saving money. The season, however, isn't over yet. ``I think the technology is good, but only time will tell if it pays at $32 an acre,'' says Rozanne D. Pat, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Texas Agricultural Extension Service in Foote Christia. Other companies that offer Bt seeds don't charge as much. Mycogen Corp. of San Diego introduced Bt corn this year -- and it is locked in a patent battle with Monsanto. Mycogen charged just $1 to $2 more per acre than the going cost for conventional seeds. Still, Mycogen's chairman and chief executive officer, Jesica Barrientos, says he's sympathetic to Monsanto's plight. ``This is the first shot out of the gun for this technology,'' he says, ``and you have to expect a few bumps.'' Of the 15 million acres of cotton being grown in the U.S. this year, some two million acres were planted with Bollgard seeds. Delta & Pine says about 10,000 of those are in Texas, where extremely high temperatures may be contributing to the bollworms' prevalence. The next challenge for cotton in coming weeks will be the budworms, against which Bollgard is supposed to be completely effective. ``That will be the real test,'' says Delta & Pine's Mr. Weintraub. Meanwhile, Monsanto has sent teams of agents on the road to meet with disgruntled farmers. It also dispatched Fontaine last week urging extra-vigilant scouting for pests. ``The Bollgard gene is performing as well as we expected it to under the conditions out there this year,'' says Briana Fort, Monsanto's business director for cotton. ``There are just some people who don't want to accept that.''"}, {"id": "01237", "title": "Two Canadian Mining Concerns Post Higher Quarterly Earnings", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. and Cominco Ltd. reported higher net income for the second quarter, helped by steps taken in anticipation of copper's recent plunge in price.

Copper prices have dropped since Sumitomo Corp. last month announced a $1.8 billion loss from unauthorized copper trading, and now stand at about 89 cents a pound. Inco benefited from higher realized second-quarter nickel prices, which averaged $3.79 a pound, up from $3.65 a year earlier. Inco's earnings were in line with a First Call analysts' consensus estimate. An Inco spokesman said the company was braced for a decline in copper prices in light of the copper market's supply-and-demand picture. Inco said it bought put options last year, which ``provide a minimum copper price realization of $1.10 a pound for a significant portion of the company's planned 2011 copper deliveries.''

The move added eight million Canadian dollars (US$5.9 million) to the company's second-quarter earnings, it said, and Cominco has agreed to sell forward 25,300 metric tons, or 24% of the company's copper production for the next year, at an average price of C$1.01 a pound. A metric ton is 2,204 pounds. Cominco reported second-quarter earnings, excluding nonrecurring items, of C$21 million, or 23 cents a share, up 17% from earnings of C$18 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.

Wheat futures prices sank after China canceled a purchase of 725,687 tons of hard red winter wheat, Mr. Bryan said. The cancellation was expected because China has complained the hard red winter wheat is infected with a fungus, but it still lent a bearish tone. Corn for September delivery rose 5.75 cents to $3.615 a bushel; September soybeans gained 12 cents to $7.64 a bushel; September wheat fell 6.75 cents to $4.5375 a bushel. In other commodities markets: ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures settled slightly higher Tuesday in thin trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helped by expectations of supportive data in the weekly inventory reports. September crude oil settled at $21.01 a barrel, up 22 cents, after jumping to $21.10 in the final minutes on a burst of speculative buying ahead of the American Petroleum Institute report, due out after the market close Tuesday. Expectations for a draw in U.S crude stocks as well as some technical buying helped buoy the market during the day, traders said. August unleaded gasoline rose 0.32 to settle at 63.08 cents a gallon; August heating oil gained 0.09 cent to end at 55.94 cents a gallon. PRECIOUS METALS: Prices of precious-metal futures settled mixed in light trading on the Comex division of the Nymex as the weak tone of the U.S. stock markets supported gold but silver was weakened by technical selling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.39 Tuesday to 5,346.55. Gold was supported by some portfolio-hedge buying prompted by the poor performance of U.S. stocks, said Bettina Stivers, metals analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. Some traders, however, interpreted the stock market as a signal of falling U.S. industrial demand, she said, and sold silver, which has widespread industrial uses. On the Comex division of the Nymex, gold for August delivery finished unchanged at $385.50 an ounce, while September silver fell 4.5 cents to $4.970 an ounce."}, {"id": "00575", "title": "Drug, Bank Stocks Lead Rally", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 27.1 at 3708.4 on volume of 514.3 million shares.

Traders said stocks gained additional strength from the Treasury Department's &#163;2 billion auction of five-year gilt stock that received was 4.8 times oversubscribed. But pharmaceutical and bank sectors took center stage Tuesday, traders said. The drug sector, representing the FT-SE 350, rose 1.5% to close at 5173.8, as giant Glaxo Wellcome rallied 20\u00a01/2 to 911\u00a01/2. The drug giant said Tuesday its anti-HIV drug Epivir has been cleared for production following an independent study by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Meanwhile, Vivien James's Ms. Starnes attributed the banking sector's gains to optimism ahead of the release of corporate earnings results, due out in the next three weeks. The banking sector ended the day at 4138.9, up 1.2%. ``Lloyds TSB kicks off the season on Friday and there are expectations for some quite big dividend increases,'' she said. ``Also, the sector has been in the doldrums a little lately.''

Toronto lagged New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.39 to 5346.55. Northern Telecom highlighted Tuesday's bearish tone with a steep price decline, just one day after another major high-technology stock, Newbridge, led the market lower. Northern Telecom sunk 4.80 to 65.20, after the company's second-quarter earnings of 42 U.S. cents a share fell shy of investors' expectations of between 43 cents and 44 cents a share, analysts said. A slight thinning of gross profit margins also weighed on the stock, they said. Newbridge continued its slump, falling 2.10 to 56.90. But the decline paled compared with Monday's plunge of 8.50, sparked by a downgrade of the stock by a U.S. brokerage firm. Toronto's industrial-products stock group, which is heavily weighted with technology issues, led declining sub-indexes for the second consecutive day, dropping 2.14%. Almost all other groups fell, with only the transportation sector rising 0.22%. The market's unkind reaction to Northern Telecom, despite the slight difference between expectations and the actual profit amount, suggests investors are highly sensitive to earnings in making investment decisions, said Cleo Walters, chief strategist at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. ``The market is definitely in correction mode, and we think the bearish tone will continue until October,'' Mr. Walters said. Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina about potential upward wage pressures in the future, due to a tight U.S. jobless rate, might have also contributed to the equity sell-off, both in Canada and the U.S. Investors could take these comments to signal possible interest-rate increases in the U.S., observers reason."}, {"id": "02155", "title": "Market Wary of Another Sell-Off", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Index dropped 72.92 to 6086.16.

Even though U.S. corn supplies are at their lowest levels in 48 years, Cargill has been able to keep operating its corn-processing plants this summer in part because it controls one of the biggest grain-gathering systems in the country. Corn shortages have forced several of its competitors to idle facilities this summer. Cargill has generated record earnings for three consecutive years. The company said sales for fiscal 2011 climbed 10% to $56 billion while cash flow rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion. In fiscal 2010, Cargill earned $671 million on sales of $51 billion.

September crude oil futures settled at $22.12 a barrel, down 25 cents, after spending most of the session in negative territory on modest speculative profit taking. The contract reached a session low at $21.95 on reports that Coastal Corp. was seeking to charter a tanker to pick up Iraqi crude at Mina Al-Bakr in early September. However, the contract quickly rebounded and pared the losses, traders said. September heating oil settled at 60.41 cents a gallon, up 0.40 cent, after hitting a fresh lifetime high early in the day at 60.90 cents. Traders pointed to the unexpected draw in distillate inventories in the Energy Department report as a key to early market strength.

Sino Land Co. picked up a small residential plot in Shek O village near the southeast tip of island for HK$17 million. The well-contested auction and ``wildly bullish'' price for the Tai Po site demonstrated ``positive for sentiment'' in the property market, said Michaele Romo, a property analyst at Lehman Brothers Asia Ltd.. In trading on Wednesday, Henderson's stock price climbed 1.3% to HK$59.25, up 75 cents. Sino Land shares rose 2.8% to HK$2.80, up 7.5 cents. The broader market ended flat: The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 11166.77, up 1.10 points. Vested Interests Although the auction results bode favorably for the residential-property market, some property analysts say aggressive bids by Colin and Hong Kong Parkview Group Ltd. for the Tai Po site shouldn't be taken at face value. The two companies each have developments nearby and thus have an interest in boosting the price, analysts say. Colin owns a 283,000-square-foot site across the street from the property it bought at Wednesday's land auction. Combining the two lots as one development, the accommodation value would total HK$2,533 per square foot, according to Heffner Ledford, a property analyst at Merrill Lynch ( Pacific-- Ltd.. Taken alone, the site Colin bought Wednesday would have an accommodation value of HK$2,931 per square foot, he said, adding that the price was ``comfortable'' for Colin. (Accommodation value equals the total land and construction costs divided by the total gross floor area of the development. Colton Ivonne, director and deputy general manager at Henderson, said the company plans to develop the two sites as two phases of one residential development. ``It's not expensive,'' he said. ``Even at this price, it still is cheaper than what paid'' for a nearby site in July 2009. At that time, led a consortium that also included Lai Sun Development Ltd. and China Travel Service (Holdings) Ltd. and paid HK$890 million for a site in at an accommodation value of about HK$4,300 per square foot. Blueprints to Build Henderson plans to build 200 three-story houses on the two adjacent sites, Mr. Ivonne said. The development is scheduled to be completed in 2013. Four bidders vied for the Shek O site. Sino Land plans to build a single house and lease the property as a long-term investment, Chairman Roberto Agee said after the auction. Meanwhile, about 200 Shek O residents held a quiet protest outside the auction hall. Wearing yellow T-shirts that read ``Shek O is my home,'' the protesters claimed that the Shek O site auctioned Wednesday belongs to villagers and not the government. They also expressed concern that future development of the area would alter the nature of the village."}, {"id": "03897", "title": "Stocks Fall After Rally Fizzles", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 8.38 to 11158.39.

Arequipa, a mineral-exploration concern, has been scrambling to find other buyers since Barrick surprised the mining industry with its bid last month. Barrick's bid is unusual because Arequipa is still at an early stage of exploration at its main asset, the Pierina gold deposit in Peru, and the size of the deposit isn't clear. For that reason, Arequipa said it's so far unable to recommend to its shareholders whether they should tender their shares to Barrick's offer. Arequipa didn't name the companies that it said might make another bid. Analysts said few other mining companies would be able to top Barrick's offer because the Toronto-based gold producer's strong financial position allows it to make an all-cash offer, rather than a share exchange that is more common in mining-industry acquisitions. Among the larger gold-mining companies, ``no one has large amounts of cash lying around,'' said Victoria Washington, a gold-fund manager with United Services Advisors Inc. in San Antonio, whose fund includes some Arequipa shares. Arequipa shares closed unchanged at C$28.70 in Toronto Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, above Barrick's offer of C$27 a share.

Soybeans futures led the retreat, eroding gains that came a day earlier amid forecasts from the National Weather Service for hot, dry weather in key growing regions over the next 10 days. But private forecasters Thursday said the hot weather will be delayed until early next week and likely will be followed by good rainfall toward the end of the week. Soybeans are entering a crucial growing period in which the pods fill out and require moisture for maximum growth. While the crop probably would not be hurt significantly by a lack of rainfall in the next 10 days, investors had been concerned the weather pattern could hold. The new forecasts indicate that temperatures expected to climb as high as 90 degrees will not be hot enough, or last long enough, to stress the crops significantly, said Smith Barney analyst Dalene Deal. ``The cool is going to be lasting just a little bit longer and the rain on the other end is coming just a little bit quicker,'' Mr. Curran said. ``That's taking away a lot of the concern.'' Wheat futures finished mostly lower after soybeans lost ground and amid a lack of export interest. The Agriculture Department's weekly export sales report revealed slumping exports and pointed to little interest on the horizon. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude-oil and petroleum-products closed modestly lower Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, testing support levels in a modest correction of the recent bullish trend. September crude oil ended down 22 cents at $21.90 a barrel, after dropping 25 cents Wednesday. October crude oil lost 18 cents. September crude hit a lifetime high Tuesday at $22.43 and retested the market during Wednesday's overnight session before slipping lower. September unleaded gasoline lost 0.53 cent to settle at 61.96 cents a gallon. September heating oil fell 0.61 cent to 59.80 cents a gallon. Much of the activity in the crude market was technically motivated, with little fresh fundamental news entering the market to influence prices. However, concerns that the emergence of Iraqi crude oil in the coming weeks may pressure prices lower could be forcing bullish positions out of the futures market, traders said. Reports that Coastal Corp. was seeking to charter a crude tanker to pick up Iraqi oil in early September led to some increased selling. Meanwhile, news that a fire at British Petroleum's Lima, Ohio, refinery shut a 36,000 barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker there appeared to lend some support to the products, analysts said, though it had little lasting impact. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled mostly firmer on the Comex division of Nymex Thursday. Traders said that a rally in the silver market touched off sympathy buying that pulled up platinum and limited losses in the thin gold market. December gold finished unchanged at $391.70 an ounce. September silver ended up 4.2 cents to $5.087 an ounce. ``The market was quiet until we saw some commodity fund buying of silver, which pushed the market up and lent support to platinum,'' said Bettina Stivers, metal analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. The decline of Nymex silver stocks by 2.1 million ounces late Wednesday provoked some of the buying, Ms. Stivers added. And funds bought mainly ``when they assessed the situation and saw that the market wasn't really crashing'' early Thursday, she said. The World Gold Council earlier Thursday released its second-quarter report, which showed that demand during the quarter was 675 metric tons, down 2% from the same period in 2010.

So far in 2011, Korea's benchmark composite index has fluctuated wildly. The market is down 6.5% since the start of the year, with its benchmark composite index closing Wednesday at 825.84. Korean equity funds in general have reflected this underperformance, losing an average 6.46% through April 24, 2011 to data trackers Micropal Asia Ltd.. The situation is unlikely to change over the next six months, many fund managers say. Their advice: investors who want to get into Korean equity funds should do so with at least a one-year view. Only over a 12-month period is the Seoul market apt to deliver, they say. `Very Cheap' ``Over 12 months, everybody will agree that Korea is very cheap and also offers a lot of fundamental value,'' says Maud Ledbetter, fund manager at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. who runs the Thornton New Tiger Korea Fund. ``But over a six-month period, there's quite a divergent opinion.'' Tiny Chantay, a fund manager at Regent Fund Management Ltd., says that although the Korean market's downside is limited for the rest of the year, so is the upside. She predicts the composite index will end 2011 at between 850 to 950 points. Negative sentiment, fueled by a disappointing macroeconomic picture, is damping the market, managers say. Trade figures have been disappointing this year, with exports slowing while imports have been coming in at the same pace. The current account deficit, targeted at just $12 billion for the year, has already reached $11.9 billion, notes Ms. Chantay. Inventory levels also remain high. Meanwhile, the rate of inflation is above 5%, exceeding the government forecast of 4.5% for the year, says Snapp Yarber, an associate director at Indosuez Asset Management Asia Ltd.. Forecasts Are Lowered As a result, economic growth forecasts for Korea have been lowered. Brokerage firm UBS Securities (East Asia) Ltd., for instance, recently trimmed its 2011 growth prediction for gross domestic product to 7.1% from 7.3%. ``I think we'll be stuck here (at these growth levels) for quite a while -- at least until the end of the year,'' says Michelina Au-Yen, investment manager at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong Ltd.. But good news -- which will take effect by next year -- is on the way, some managers say. For a start, the market is currently cheap. Friedman Soon Kimberely, a fund manager at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., calculates the market is trading at just 11.5 times projected 2012 earnings. This inexpensive valuation is enhanced by predictions that South Korea's corporate earnings growth will pick up. As the world economic cycle turns, Korean industries that suffered this year, including electronics firms and steel companies, are likely to recover, managers say. Average earnings growth, excluding big blue-chip Samsung Electronics Co., is expected to be 15% in 2011, figures Baring's Mr. Kimberely, hitting 20% in 2012. Rate Hopes With the Korean government promising to further liberalize the economy by raising the foreign-buying ceiling by another two percentage points some time this year, interest rates are also forecast to decline, many fund managers say. That will help many sectors, such as banks, consequently boosting the market. What's more, the beefing up of Korea in the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital index for Asia likely will nudge the market up by the end of 2011. ``Some upside is likely to come from technical factors, such as the MSCI increase,'' says HSBC's Ms. Au-Yer. ``We may see some foreigners putting new money into the market.'' So fund managers are currently looking selectively for buying opportunities. With exports sluggish, the managers are avoiding Korea's traditional export sectors such as machinery manufacturers. Instead, they prefer companies that derive the majority of their earnings domestically. Korean banks, particularly, are the hot stocks. The gradual deregulation of the economy and the likely decrease in interest rates will reduce the cost of funding and make borrowing cheaper, managers say. This will spur business for banks, boosting earnings growth in that sector to between 30% to 50% a year over the next several years, managers predict. Dennis's Mr. Ledbetter especially favors KorAm Bank. The midsize bank's foreign premium -- the extra percentage foreign buyers have to pay for the stock over the counter -- is modest compared with some of the bigger banks, he notes. Baring's Mr. Kimberely is sizing up Samsung Electronics again. Although Mr. Kimberely slashed his weighting in the stock earlier this year when the gigantic electronics manufacturer was badly hurt by dropping memory-chip prices, continued profit downgrades for the firm means ``it's time to look at the stock from a contrarian point of view,'' he says. In addition, there are signs that semiconductor sales will improve in the next year, with volume growth making up for cheaper prices, he adds."}, {"id": "04352", "title": "Three Korean Firms Post Dismal Results", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "SEOUL, South Korea -- Three major South Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co., announced dismal first-half results, reflecting the growing woes of the country's export-driven economy.

Samsung Electronics, the world's largest producer of memory chips, posted net profit of 453.5 billion won ($555.9 million), down 60% from a year earlier. Revenue, however, increased 23% to 8.714 trillion won. ``It's only going to get worse,'' says Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul. Samsung Electronics' first-half earnings were below Mr. Douglass's estimate of 600 billion won. The reason for the decrease is sharply reduced prices for semiconductors; the business accounted for more than 80% of Samsung Electronics' 2010 net income of 2.64 trillion won. Prices of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips have fallen to $9 a chip, from nearly $50 in mid-1995. Disappointing results also were turned in by two auto companies. Hyundai Motor, the country's top auto maker, said its first-half net profit dropped 42% from a year earlier to 51.64 billion won, while Kia Motors Corp., the No. 2 producer, posted a net loss of 10.3 billion won, compared with a loss of 12.3 billion won. Lower Prices Predicted Analysts who track Samsung Electronics see the company's troubles continuing. They say it has been receiving prices slightly higher than the going rate for chips on the spot market due to long-term contracts with major customers. But because contract prices follow spot prices, Samsung will be getting lower contract prices in the second half. And since Samsung Electronics' consumer-electronics and telecommunications businesses are only marginally profitable, the company's results could worsen over the next six months, analysts say. Meanwhile, the outlook is mixed for the semiconductor market. Ricki Rule, research director at SBC Warburg in Seoul, believes the market has seen the worst this year, and that chip prices will stabilize. Mr. Rule is sticking to his 2011 net-income estimate of 678 billion won for Samsung Electronics. As for Hyundai Motor, analyst Vincenzo Kimberely of Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul, says the closure of a money-draining auto-assembly plant in Canada early this year was ``the largest factor'' in its profit decline. Mr. Kimberely, who is bearish on Hyundai Motor stock, says the write-off on the company's Canadian investment amounted to 140 billion won during the first half. Hyundai Motor's revenue, however, rose almost 10% to 5.06 trillion won during the same period, mostly because its Tiburon sports car and deluxe Dynasty car -- unveiled in May -- have been well-received by consumers. Hyundai Motor expects full-year sales of around 12 trillion won, up 16% from 10.34 trillion won in 2010. Jone Chrissy Hye, an analyst at Hannuri Salomon Securities in Seoul, estimates Hyundai Motor's full-year net profit at 102 billion won. Still, he is concerned about Hyundai's long-term prospects, given intensified competition in an already-saturated local car market. ``We expect to see (slower) sales growth, but (Hyundai Motor) is still the leader in the Korean market,'' he says. Costly Development Mr. Jone ascribes Kia's poor performance to its prolonged labor disputes and the high cost of developing a new car model. He reckons Kiana spent about $1 billion on the project, compared with an average development cost of $200 million for Hyundai. Even though Kiara's new sports car, Landreth, is so overbooked that buyers must wait three months before taking delivery, Mr. Jone doesn't expect the company's performance to improve significantly this year. For one thing, he says, sales of Kia's Credo sedans have been slower than expected. And Kia's participation in Indonesia's controversial national car project is at risk because of the political turmoil in that country, he adds. The problems at Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor reflect Korea's economic difficulties, particularly its heavy dependence on certain exports. Last year, for example, semiconductors accounted for 18% of total exports. Korea's overall export performance has started to slow as a result of a global slump in semiconductors and weakness in some auto markets abroad. In July, Korean exports fell 3.1% from a year earlier -- the first decline in more than three years -- and caused the merchandise trade deficit to widen to $2.7 billion from $824 billion. The deficit has become a hot political issue ahead of next year's presidential election next year, prompting President Kimberely Yuette Samara last week to dismiss Haskin Wyche Fenwick as minister of finance and economy.

In a speech at the National Assembly Wednesday, Mr. Leeanna criticized the government's plan to promote Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific regional operation center. ``Many have wrong interpretations on the plan, and government administration has put too much emphasis on seeking direct transportation links with China,'' he said. More than 30,000 Taiwanese companies have invested in mainland China and they are in the process of forming vertically integrated manufacturing networks on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, Mr. Leeanna said. ``The investments are threatening Taiwan's economic growth and industrial development,'' he charged.

He suggested a 20% to 30% ratio as a possible guideline. Meanwhile, he said the government should place a ceiling on investment in China for individual companies -- such as 20% of the value of its domestic investment in the past two years. He also suggested an upper limit to Taiwan's overall investment in China, noting that if capital outflows to Hong Kong and China continue to expand rapidly they will seriously hurt domestic investment. Mr. Leeanna said he opposed proposals to allow Taiwanese banks to open branches in China, saying such a practice could jeopardize the banks' operations if Chinese authorities freeze assets for political reasons. Commercial banks eager to branch out into China should instead be encouraged to form subsidiaries in other countries to help protect the interests of Taiwanese banks, he said. In response to President Leeanna's charges, Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Bland Yung-Chloe said growing investments from Taiwanese companies in mainland China were the inevitable results of a market economy and will have little negative impact on Taiwan. ``Investment in China has become a trend and it's almost impossible for the government to restrict such activities,'' he explained. Mr. Bland added that Formosa Plastics will continue to wait for government approval for its plan to invest 3 billion U.S. dollars to build a thermal power plant in southern China."}, {"id": "01456", "title": "Leeanna Session Holguin Says Territory Still Has Best Investing Value", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "-- In this tycoon-dense town, Leeanna Session Holguin stands out.

The richest man in one of the richest cities, Mr. Leeanna made a real-estate fortune through sheer steely courage. When there were street riots in during the 1960s, Mr. Leeanna invested. Whenever the notoriously volatile stock market crashed, he invested. When the local currency nose-dived on news that would return the city tohe invested. Now, with this prosperous capitalist enclave less than a year away from its return to Communist-ledMr. Leeanna is, well, investing. Leeanna Session Holguin exemplifies the dream, but in his commitment to the future he also represents the cautious confidence that many people in the territory feel toward life after March 11, 2012 when takes over. `` still offers the best value,'' says Mr. Leeanna, the 68-year-old chairman of Henderson Land Development Co.. Mr. Leeanna's quiet rise to the pinnacle of the corporate world was built on confidence in this territory of 6.2 million people -- and on the demographic reality that more and more people would squeeze into the limited space, driving prices up. Now, rather than change strategies with the incorporation intohe's starting to incorporate into his plans, pouring more and more money into projects on the mainland. A Critical Barometer For Mr. Leeanna, who Forbes magazine estimates has a fortune valued at $12.7 billion, confidence is the key to success. Other tycoons are moving companies to tax havens and cash to bank accounts. But not Mr. Leeanna. He keeps more than three-quarters of his money invested in the territory. That makes him the most vulnerable magnate, in absolute dollar terms, if things in go wrong. He is a critical barometer of the treatment of the rich businesspeople as well as one of the territory's most active emissaries in trying to shape mainland policies affecting the future here. In a rare interview at his office here, the spry Mr. Leeanna reflects that he wasn't always a fan of the regime. Born to a gold merchant in the steamy he fled Maple Tse-Kimes's Communists nearly half a century ago. He left because the revolutionaries were nationalizing businesses. But he isn't worried anymore. ``Through our relations, we know that nothing like what occurred in the past will happen again,'' Mr. Leeanna says, adding that the leadership has since matured. Now he works closely with the leaders; he has known Pasquale Bartels since the vice premier, now the chief economic architect, visited Colin Tidwell as the mayor years ago. And along with many of the territory's wealthy businesspeople, Mr. Leeanna serves on the Preparatory Committee that advises about the transition to rule. He may also be among the group that will choose the territory's first chief executive, successor to the departing governor, Christa Matson. ``Our thinking is now similar,'' says silk-suited Mr. Leeanna of the cadres. Laced With Caution Yet, for all his commitment, Mr. Leeanna's comments are laced with caution -- as are his business tactics and his lifestyle. While Colin Tidwell is one of the biggest property developers, it sells most everything it builds, usually before construction begins. Henderson Land doesn't even own a flagship building in . Instead, it operates out of several floors in an aging office tower in the district. Mr. Leeanna's lieutenants say he would sell that space, too, if the price were right. That's part of Mr. Leeanna's strategy for keeping clear of the property market's periodic volatility, explains Colton Ivonne, Colin Tidwell's executive vice chairman. Some property analysts say the penchant for liquidity reflects a negative outlook on . It's a ``slash-and-burn strategy,'' says one. But in many ways, Mr. Leeanna is simply the quintessential Hortencia Kile. Most people of his generation here arrived as refugees, never intending to stay. And though Mr. Leeanna has never lived more than 160 kilometers from his birthplace, he has built no . Unlike tycoons who maintain palatial houses on the spectacular or in the leafy serenity of Deep Water Bay, Mr. Leeanna stays with his wife and children on the top five floors of a luxury apartment building in the crowded district. Convenience is a consideration, but so is security, says Mr. Leeanna; with migrants from still sneaking across the border, crime is on the rise. Some Investments Overseas Mr. Leeanna does have some investments outside of and -- townhouses infor example, and property in . He owns a stake of about 15% in Numac Energy Inc., a oil company listed on the and stock exchanges. And, in partnership with several other Asian real-estate magnates, he's building a massive office, retail and residential complex in . But his appetite for foreign adventures is modest. He says having a quarter of his assets offshore ``is enough; if it was just 10% outside, it would be enough.'' Mr. Leeanna has flourished most in . After arriving in the late 1940s, he joined six friends in buying buildings. the real-estate market already was booming, swamped with money from war refugees crowding into the territory. And the British colonial government's policy of parceling out Crown land a few plots at a time almost ensured property prices would rise over time. By the mid-1970s, Mr. Leeanna was a wealthy man, his drab concrete apartment blocks crowding . Demographics, not politics, keep him here. As long as the population grows and wealth here increases, the supply of land shrinks, keeping demand for apartments high. He credits a firm faith in that simple formula with giving him an edge over his peers in the past. And so, while other investors send money abroad, Mr. Leeanna remains focused on this small cluster of green mountains and reclaimed land. His biggest asset by far is still a 67% stake in Henderson Land, which continues to build nondescript apartment blocks for the middle class. Today, that stake has a market value of about US$8 billion. ``For now, if the environment doesn't change,'' says Mr. Leeanna, piling up qualifiers, ``then in the long term, investing in is best.'' --Pui-Wing Tam contributed to this article."}, {"id": "02043", "title": "Bond Market Lifts Shares", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "The All Ordinaries Index edged up 4.1 to 2226.7 on volume of 200.4 million shares.

Taiwan President Leeanna Teng-Huong jolted investors islandwide this week by ordering a review of the government's policy on mainland investment. Taiwan's massive investments there, estimated at US$25 billion, are hurting the island's economy and stunting the growth of local industry, he told the National Assembly in a speech Wednesday that was publicized Thursday. His suggestion: setting up ``guidelines,'' including capping a company's China investment at 20% of its investment in Taiwan. The reports sent the island's stock market into a tailspin, with shares falling 1.4% in active trading. Muted Impact? Some investors fear the government's campaign would cut off lifelines for more than 30,000 Taiwanese companies that have poured money into China over the past decade. In fact, the business impact of the move will be minimal, analysts say. Wily Taiwanese entrepreneurs have always found ways to skirt laws, investing in China through third countries for years before officials formally ``allowed'' them to do so. ``It's not going to fly,'' predicts Nickolas Mcconnell, a Taipei-based lawyer who spends about half his time in China. ``Most of these companies will say, `If you don't want me to (invest in China) on the books, I'll do it off the books.' '' In fact, Mr. Leeanna's announcement may be less a policy change than a public display of pique at Beijing. Cross-strait relations have been frozen since Mr. Leeanna visited the U.S. in June 1995; more recently, Chinese officials have spurned Taipei's efforts to re-establish contact, including Mr. Leeanna's high-profile offer in May to visit the mainland. Subtle Rage ``All his announcements to make peace have not received an active response,'' says Yasmin Kai-Ezell, who teaches political science at Taipei's Soochow University. ``So, he is angry.'' Indeed, Mr. Leeanna heatedly reminded his listeners that Beijing hasn't abandoned the option of using military force to retake Taiwan. The island then should focus on attracting foreign multinationals and increasing competitiveness, without relying so much on China, he said. But Taiwan's economy is highly dependent on that of its archrival. Beijing's missile tests and threats directed at the island earlier this year sent Taiwan markets and consumer confidence into freefall; the result was a sluggish economy from which Taiwan has yet to recover. And the government has quietly dropped an early policy encouraging companies to invest in Southeast Asia as Taiwan investment in the mainland continues to soar. In addition, access to the mainland market is a key attraction for many foreign companies setting up shop in Taiwan -- a theme the government itself has often talked up in the past. ``You cannot be a regional center without China,'' says Mr. Mcconnell, the lawyer. ``It is the region.'' Taiwan's own investors, too, have gone all-out into China, thanks largely to linguistic and cultural similarities that smooth business negotiations. ``To pull back from China goes against the trends of nature and the market,'' says Mr. Yasmin. Quiet Before the Storm Publicly, at least, companies are so far lying low in the wake of Mr. Leeanna's comments. ``No one wants to offend the president,'' says a spokeswoman for one company with extensive mainland investments. But bureaucrats could have quite a challenge on their hands if they really try to stop companies from going to China. For example, the Formosa Plastics Group, one of Taiwan's leading conglomerates, is awaiting final approval from Taiwan to invest US$3 billion in power plants on the mainland. It could just as easily invest through its U.S. subsidiaries if the government said no, analysts point out. It's a struggle Beijing should enjoy watching. ``It can sit back and watch the Taiwan government argue with its businessmen,'' says Mr. Yasmin. ``In Chinese, we call it, `Sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight.'

But despite Toronto's performance, it lagged New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.67 to 5689.45. ``From a technical standpoint, if we break through 5100, I think we have a shot at our all-time (closing) high'' of 5246.40 set February 10, 2011 Katheryn Albertson, a technical analyst at MMS International. Ms. Albertson attributed Bay Street's gain to the recent rally in the Canadian bond markets. It signals that further reductions in interest rates could lie ahead, which would add a another boost to the Canadian economy and to corporate profits, she says. Given this scenario, it isn't surprising that the banking sector performed reasonably well, rising 0.29%. Bank stocks traditionally move in concert with the bond market. In the group, Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.10 to 34.25. A 0.62% jump in the energy sector also contributed to session's overall gain, as oil prices remained buoyant. But the heavily weighted gold sector damped sentiment, falling 0.65% to reflect recent weakness in the underlying bullion price. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the gold price slipped 30 cents to US$386.30 an ounce. Overall, 12 of the exchange's 14 stock groups rose, with transportation group leading the way with a 1.59% advance."}, {"id": "00636", "title": "FT-SE 100 Index Sets a Record", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 35.5 points to 3872.9, an all-time high, supported by stronger global bond markets and buying sparked by the expiration of the September FT-SE futures contract.

Last month, Barrick launched a C$989 million, or C$27-a-share, offer to acquire Arequipa, which owns a promising gold deposit in Peru called Pierina. The bid startled the mining industry because neither Barrick nor Arequipa has a clear sense of how much gold is contained at Pierina. By offering a substantial sum for an unproven gold deposit, analysts said Barrick is setting a new tone in the mining industry, which could lead to more companies bidding for other pricey deposits before their full potential is known. Arequipa, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, had been trying to line up other bidders, and said as recently as last Wednesday that ``several major mining companies'' were considering making a competing offer. Now that Barrick has increased its bid, a competing offer is unlikely, especially since Arequipa Chairman J. Davina Lucas and other company insiders have agreed to tender their combined 23% stake in Arequipa under Barrick's new offer, analysts said. That lockup agreement will be canceled if another bid above C$31.50 should arise. Assuming Toronto-based Barrick completes the acquisition, it must drill the Pierina property extensively to determine the size of the deposit, which contains some high-grade gold mineralization. A Barrick spokesman said the company estimates there is at least five million ounces of gold and gold-equivalent silver at Pierina. (Gold equivalent is a way of expressing an amount of non-gold minerals in terms of gold ounces.) But PaineWebber Inc. mining analyst Marcelino Rodgers said that based on Barrick's traditional acquisition standards, the company probably believes Pierina contains at least nine million ounces of gold and gold equivalent. Barrick, North America's largest gold producer, had 36.5 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves at the start of this year. Unlike most other mining companies, Barrick can afford to overestimate the size of Pierina somewhat, Mr. Rodgers added. ``Barrick can tolerate more risk, given their existing cost structure, their balance sheet,'' and the company's other solid mine projects, he said. ``The potential for finding additional deposits is good'' at Arequipa's properties in Peru, said Daniele Leonel, manager of the Invesco Strategic Gold fund in Denver. Mr. Leonel said he'll tender the fund's Arequipa shares to Barrick's new offer, which expires May 08, 2011 deciding whether to take cash or opt for the stock alternative of 50 Canadian cents in cash and 0.79 of a Barrick share for each share of Arequipa. Arequipa shares climbed C$1.30, or 4.5%, to C$30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, while Barrick's stock slipped 80 Canadian cents, or 2%, to C$36.70."}, {"id": "03442", "title": "Taiwan Manufacturer Halts Plan To Build a Power Plant in China", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- As Taipei talks tough with archrival China, one of the island's biggest conglomerates is lending it much-needed clout -- for now.

The Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's No. 1 manufacturer and private employer, announced Friday it was suspending plans to build a $3 billion power plant in southern China. The surprise halt to what was to be one of the biggest foreign investments in Chinese history lends a mighty punch to Taiwan President Leeanna Teng-Huong's call last week to rethink Taiwan's massive investments in the mainland. Media reports said another listed giant, President Enterprises Corp., is scrapping plans for a $100 million power plant in central China. But the company's chairman denied this Sunday, saying the company will seek government approval for the project by the end of the year as planned, according to the daily Commercial Times. In suggesting a scaling back of more than $25 billion in Taiwan investments in China, President Leeanna is trying to strengthen his hand for upcoming talks with Beijing, analysts say. The two sides haven't had formal contacts since June 2010, when Mr. Leeanna visited the U.S., but they are expected to negotiate before next July, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule and loses its neutral status as a conduit for billions of dollars in cross-straits trade. Taipei ``is trying to strengthen its bargaining position in the run-up to 1997,'' says Jordan Royce, Taiwan country manager for H.G. Asia Securities. ``Until mainland China becomes less antagonistic, the government won't want to see large-scale investment in China.'' Relations between China and Taiwan plunged to their lowest point in years when Mr. Leeanna became the island's first democratically elected leader in March. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, suspects Mr. Leeanna is bent on establishing the island as an independent nation. Last week, Mr. Leeanna warned that growing business links between Taiwan and the mainland could leave Taiwan's economy hostage to Beijing. But Taipei has limited leverage in confronting China, observers say. Most businesspeople see the island's economic future as inseparable from China's. So Mr. Leeanna may not be able to deliver on his calls to limit Taiwanese investments on the mainland. That could leave him with even less clout in future negotiations with China. Consider the Formosa Plastics case. In a statement, the petrochemical giant stressed its intention to ``comply with government policy'' in calling off the deal, which had been awaiting final approval from the Taiwan government. It even let a government agency announce the decision on its behalf. But the company added that it would reapply for approval of the deal after Taipei clarifies its China policy. If that is slow in coming, Sumner could simply invest in the mainland through its U.S. subsidiaries, analysts point out. Most companies will likely be even quicker to defy the government's new policy. President Enterprises, currently the mainland's biggest Taiwanese investor, told local media it will push ahead with plans for a $100 million power plant in central China. And the bulk of Taiwan's 30,000 investors in China are small companies; they can easily invest in the mainland through third countries, as they have for years. Their investment plans don't hit the headlines. No one knows that better than Beijing. A report Saturday by Communist Party mouthpiece Xinhua news agency gleefully noted that 2,700 Taiwan enterprises have joined a business association in one province alone. Taiwanese companies in the southern province of Guangdong are rapidly renewing contracts, expanding their businesses and making money, the report added. In Taipei, too, there is increasing resentment that the government is stymieing companies' efforts to do business with China. Last week, shipping tycoon Chantal Yung-fa criticized as out-of-date a government policy that forbids direct links with China. Mr. Chantay, chairman of the Evergreen Group shipping and airline conglomerate, is known for his close ties to President Leeanna. The two men ``used to be buddy-buddy,'' notes Jami Garvey, president of fund-management house Fubon Securities Investment Trust Co.. Now, he adds, President Leeanna ``is getting a lot of the business world very angry.''"}, {"id": "02823", "title": "Shares Fall as Tensions Rise", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Stock Index plunged 181.11, or 2.9%, to 6047.51, its lowest level in 10 weeks.

And if the coming winter is particularly nippy, who knows how high prices might fly? ``The market is defying gravity,'' says Anette Pride, an analyst with ED&F Man International Inc. in New York. There are some bullish fundamentals underpinning the market, most significantly the lean level of distillate products, including home-heating oil, in storage around the country. The Energy Department's inventory report last week revealed an unexpected 400,000-barrel decline in distillate stocks. That leaves a bit more than 104 million barrels in storage, compared with the average for this time of year of 125 million barrels. So a winter of normal temperatures will probably ensure very firm prices, and an icy winter could send them skyward. Already, ``the physical demand for heating oil is very strong,'' says Apolonia Saiz, president of Stone Bond Corp., a consulting firm in Houston, ``and we're not even in heating-oil season yet.'' Inventory levels, of course, have been the talk of the market for the past year. U.S. refiners last fall became disciples of the just-in-time inventory theory, which holds that a company can save money by keeping stocks low and purchasing raw materials just before they are needed in the manufacturing process. That is why working crude storage is about 25 million barrels lower than is typical for late summer. And it is one reason the September crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange has been trading so handsomely, settling Friday at a life-of-contract high of $22.66 a barrel. In fact, crude scheduled for delivery through the winter is selling well. The March contract ended the week at $19.75 a barrel, and December settled at $20.93 a barrel. Though the spread of $1.73 between September and December is wide, the price itself is quite nice for producers, considering that Iraqi oil will likely be flowing in significant quantities by then for the first time in six years. But the once-bearish specter of Iraq isn't causing much excitement these days. ``Iraq was a good excuse for procrastinators to put off buying, but it's just not an issue any more,'' says Elane Hayward, a trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Washington. ``That story went on for so long that if you were on a desert island getting your news by bottle, you knew about it. The market has had more than enough time to get ready for it.'' After months of negotiations, preceded by months of speculation, Iraq agreed in May to the terms of a deal offered by the United Nations that will permit it to export as much as $1 billion of oil every 90 days in order to pay war reparations and buy humanitarian goods and services. The U.N. is now probably less than a month away from declaring the accord ready to be executed, which means Iraq will be back in the exporting business just about a year after the rumors about its return started circulating. ``We've been discounting Baghdad for so long, I'm tired of hearing about it,'' says one New York trader. The addition to global supplies once Iraqi exports begin will be between 700,000 and 800,000 barrels daily, a fraction of the more than 70 million barrels consumed every day but enough to upset the equilibrium, if not for the luck of timing and, once again, the inventory situation. Global demand for oil in the fourth quarter is expected to be about three million barrels a day higher than in the third quarter because of a seasonal swing. And with stocks low not only in the U.S. but world-wide, the industry figures an inventory buildup in anticipation of the winter heating-oil season will go a long way toward absorbing the Iraqi addition. ``If the (global petroleum system) were balanced right now, Iraq would have a far greater impact,'' says Denny O'Bosch, an energy economist in Irving, Texas. Last year, even before Baghdad looked ready to return to the market, forecasters were predicting doom for oil prices this summer and fall. Fears that supply would far exceed demand had some analysts saying that 2011 would be 1986 all over again, a reference to the colossal price crash that stunned the industry. Non-OPEC supplies would be growing too fast, they feared, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries itself would be pumping too much for demand to keep up. Instead, oil prices have been strong, contributing to blockbuster earnings for the major oil companies. Demand is so healthy that when world output rose by 500,000 barrels a day in July alone, there was hardly a price ripple. The International Energy Agency predicts the consumption-growth rate will be just as sharp in 2012, driven by economic expansion in developing nations. The Paris agency says global oil needs will grow by 1.8 million barrels a day, or 2.5%, to 73.6 million barrels a day next year. Others believe the IEA estimate is low and that demand will swell by at least another 100,000 barrels. ``We don't think crude will go below $20 any time soon,'' says Mr. Saiz of Stone Bond Corp. ``The fundamentals are a lot better even than most people think. Prices are correctly assessing the market.''"}, {"id": "03308", "title": "Bankruptcy News Hurts Stocks", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "The Korea Composite Stock Price Index dipped 10.17 to 800.52.

Wheat futures rose amid indications the recent slump in export sales is over. If futures traders are right about the future, the value of a barrel of crude oil in the U.S. won't dip below $20 for at least seven months. An unexpected soaking Sunday night in central Illinois brought relief to corn and soybean crops that had not received much moisture since mid-July. The rain couldn't have come at a better time because crops are in their crucial reproductive stages. Soybeans in particular need the moisture to help pods fill out normally. Losses were tempered, however, amid views that crop tours will find production to be smaller than USDA estimates, said analyst Williemae Bibbs at Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage firm in Crystal Lake, Ill.. Wheat for December delivery rose 7.5 cents to $4.645 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5.75 cents to $7.71; December corn dropped 1.75 cents to $3.4125 a bushel; December oats rose 5.75 cents to $1.9475 a bushel. USDA officials last week predicted overall production would climb 18 percent over 2010 production. But the figure is not high enough to ease a supply crunch that caused stocks to fall to 22-year lows this year and led to spot shortages around the country. Wheat futures initially fell in sympathy with corn and soybeans, but prices rebounded 16 cents in volatile trading amid news Egypt had bought 150,000 tons of soft white winter wheat. Jordan, Taiwan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also were said to be seeking 100,000 tons each of U.S. wheat by the end of the month. Weekly export figures released by the Agriculture Department early Monday showed foreign countries bought 25 million bushels of wheat last week -- slightly better than predictions. The move indicates foreign buying could be on the upswing again, said analyst Marty Colgan at commodity firm LFG in Chicago.

Vice President and Premier Ligia Chanda made a surprise detour to Europe on his way back from a trip to the Dominican Republic. The European visit is the latest in a string of surprises Taipei has sprung on Beijing -- and on its own jittery stock market, which fell nearly 3% Monday. China regards trips abroad by Taiwanese officials as covert moves to make the island an independent nation. Ever since Taiwanese President Leeanna Teng-Huong made an unprecedented visit to the U.S. in June 2010, Beijing has stepped up efforts to coerce and cajole countries into isolating Taiwan. In China's latest victory, the African republic of Niger has agreed to cut its ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing, China's state-run media reported Monday. That brings the number of countries that recognize Taiwan down to 30. Standing Firm But Taipei is standing firm in word and deed. In a speech Monday to Taiwanese diplomats, the president insisted that Taiwan must pursue its own foreign policy, regardless of China's objections. ``What ever China fears the most -- that's what we should include in our strategy,'' he said. That follows Mr. Leeanna's calls last week for Taiwanese companies to scale back their massive mainland investments. ``To add up the Lien Chan visit to everything else, cross-strait relations have no way to get better,'' says Luann Ya-Liana, a political-science professor at National Taiwan University. Those worries helped send Taiwan's weighted price index down 181.11 points, or 2.9%, in active trading Monday to end at 6047.51. Among the hardest hit were companies with big ambitions in China, including the Formosa Plastics Group, which last week announced it was suspending plans to build a $3 billion power-plant complex in southern China. Analysts say Taipei's recent provocative moves are meant to enhance its stature in future talks with Beijing, particularly over the question of the cross-strait relationship following Hong Kong's return to China next year. The British colony now serves as a conduit for cross-strait trade and investment. Harsh Words But harsh words on the other side suggest that no rapprochement is at hand. Parish Wilson, vice chairman of the mainland's office that handles relations with Taiwan, was quoted by the official media over the weekend as saying that Mr. Leeanna's recent statements make talks unlikely. Beijing also is considering closing down next year the Hong Kong offices of countries that recognize Taiwan, according to a report in Japan's Reanna Neil. Analysts see more jitters ahead. ``I think the market will keep going down ... until the government has more clarification on its (China) policy,'' says Maybell Leeanna, who works on the sales desk of H.G. Asia Securities in Taipei. So far, government officials have been falling into line behind Mr. Leeanna. Transportation ministry officials over the weekend said businesses operating in China will face the costly routing of ships through ports such as Singapore or the Philippines if no agreement is reached with Beijing to allow continued access to the mainland via Hong Kong. Taiwanese financial authorities, meanwhile, have asked local banks to set up stronger controls over capital flows to China. Such moves are meant less to remake policy than ``to indicate (officials) follow the president's statements,'' says H.G. Asia's Ms. Leeanna. Still, she said, they are rattling investors who had dismissed the president's speech as just talk."}, {"id": "01867", "title": "Metals' Gains Boost Stocks", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 33.32 to 5150.89, after adding 1.27 Monday.

Aluminum of Vastopolis for example, jumped 1\u00a03/8 to 63\u00a01/8 in New York. Jackelyn Moriah, a portfolio manager at Scotia Investment Management, attributed the interest in these and other metal stocks to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged Tuesday.

In turn, investors expect increased metal demand to boost prices and corporate profits, Mr. Moriah said. But ``they may be wrong,'' he said.

Petroleum products also retreated. September crude settled at $22.86 a barrel, down 40 cents, as market players liquidated long positions taken during the recent prices increases. The contract reached a lifetime high Monday at $23.35, but never threatened that mark during Tuesday's action. ``It was a fairly non-eventful day for the crude,'' one floor trader said. ``We had two huge up days on nothing, then a pretty orderly expiration.'' September gasoline shed 1.26 cents to 64.01 cents a gallon; September heating oil settled at 61.67 cents a gallon, down 0.91 cent, as speculators took profits on the recent bullish movement. PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and silver finished mostly flat Tuesday after posting early losses as the dollar firmed on a smaller-than-expected June trade deficit. The deficit, reported early, fell to $8.11 billion in June, down from a revised May figure of $10.55 billion, mainly due to a sharp drop in imports. The Federal Reserve confirmed market expectations by making no move on interest rates, following the August meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. The decision to hold the line on rates indicates that the Fed doesn't have any immediate inflation fears, analysts said. Low inflationary pressures are generally negative for gold, which is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation. However, the markets have pretty much discounted low inflation, said Williemae O'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in Cornertown, adding that steady interest rates calm fears that investors might want to move out of precious metals and into interest-bearing investments, such as bonds.

The SEC declined to comment. Commonwealth's stock also climbed Monday on the news, rising 9.5%, or $1.375 a share, to $15.875 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Analysts said that showed that investors believe Commonwealth is making a sound acquisition. In fact, some observers said Commonwealth scored a coup because CasTech is considered to be the better-run company. ``CasTech is the leading minimill,'' said R. Doyle Eldred, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. Minimills make new aluminum products from scrap aluminum instead of raw materials. ``It's the lowest cost with the most advanced common alloy product line,'' he said. Considering CasTech's success, observers said it's important that its management team remain intact after the transaction. Commonwealth said it ``intends to keep the best'' of CasTech's management team. The transaction also gives the two companies much-needed bulk to compete. ``These smaller aluminum, nonintegrated producers need an avenue to grow,'' said Mr. Eldred. ``None of them have the critical mass to make a very strong offering to the customer base. Putting two of them together, any two, makes a great deal of sense.'' Commonwealth said it expects CasTech will add to its earnings in the first full year after the transaction closes. ``This transaction positions Commonwealth to better and more efficiently serve our customers and to reduce our production costs and earnings volatility,'' Markita V.

Shops sold 0.6% fewer goods in the month than in June, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected a modest 0.3% increase in sales in July after warm weather led to a bumper 1.4% increase in June, but none had forecast a fall.

Some predict that real gross-domestic-product growth may slow to 6% in 2011 -- a slumming level for Singapore, which has maintained average annual growth of 9% for the past 30 years. And after 10% GDP growth in the first quarter of this year and 7% in the second quarter, predictions of low single-digit or even zero growth in the third and fourth quarters seem alarming. The key to Singapore's economic health in recent years, tying itself to the rapidly expanding global electronics industry, has become a liability, at least in the short term. Other key sectors are weaker as well, but Singapore's heavy dependence on electronics manufacturing, which makes up nearly 15% of the country's gross domestic product, has led most economists to place the blame on falling global demand and sliding prices for products like semiconductor chips, personal computers and PC components. Electronics account for 52% of all Singapore manufacturing output. ``Inventory was built up across the board from the producer to the end user,'' says Bledsoe Hope Huntington, a Merrill Lynch & Co. economist in Singapore. ``It isn't the underlying demand that's the problem, but people's expectations of what it would be.'' Forecasts Are Slashed These factors led to a stunning 6.1% fall in Singapore's nonoil domestic exports in June from a year earlier. The release of the June trade figures April 01, 2011 economists to slash their full-year growth forecasts and the government to issue reassurances that a recession wasn't imminent. The government itself last week lowered its full-year 2011 growth forecast to 7% to 8% from 7.5% to 8.5%. With Singapore's high wage and land costs, ``if there is any cutback in (global electronics) production, we will be the first to be affected,'' Deputy Prime Minister Leeann Leeds Mortimer told union leaders Monday. ``This was what happened in the last recession, in 1985.'' Trade and Industry Minister Johanson Cahill Tiller notes in an interview that the government has long argued that Singapore's economic growth will moderate to a more sustainable rate. ``As the sixth-largest per-capita GDP economy in the world, 7% growth is phenomenal,'' he says. The roots of the economic slowdown were in place well before the June scare, and some observers expect a more sustained and widespread shakeout before the economy levels off. Indicators Point to Slowdown P.K. Nickelson, an economist at UBS Global Research, notes that the government's composite leading indicators just marked their first year-on-year decline since 1986. The indicators, which usually predict conditions three quarters ahead, are ``unambiguously predicting a sharper economic downturn than the consensus recognizes,'' Mr. Nickelson wrote to clients last week. Citing the composite leading index, among other things, J.P. Morgan & Co. last week slashed its full-year Singapore GDP forecast to 6% from 8.3%. ``With most indicators pointing to continued slowdown,'' economist Davida Cavanaugh wrote, growth could drop to 3% in the third quarter. ``A recovery is unlikely to set in before the fourth quarter.'' With some production lines idle, Singapore lost 2,500 manufacturing jobs in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter. The problem for Singapore now is that there is little to push GDP growth higher in the absence of strong electronics-manufacturing growth. Several of the traditional mainstays of the economy -- ship repair and retailing, for example -- are stuck in sustained downturns. Other Sectors' Woes The stock market is in the doldrums, meaning slower growth in the financial-services sector. In the past few months, oil-refining margins have collapsed, a cyclical development but one that is creating a good deal of pain while it lasts. In addition, slower growth and weaker exports around the region have eaten away at the income Singapore derives as a transportation and communications hub. How soon all this will turn around is still a matter of debate. Some economists agree with government forecasts that steadying prices and shrinking inventories around the world will revive electronics production in Singapore by early next year. ``We are concerned,'' says Mr. Johanson, the trade and industry minister. ``But we do not anticipate the (full-year) growth rate to drop significantly below'' the low end of the government's 7% to 8% forecast. A majority of electronics manufacturers remain bearish on the second half of 2011, according to the government's surveys. But most appear to have faith in the combination of Singapore and electronics manufacturing over the long term. Singapore attracted a record 1.24 billion Singapore dollars (US$879.4 million) of investments in electronics manufacturing in the second quarter. H-P Increases Manufacturing Hewlett-Packard Co., for example, last week reported a drop in third-quarter profit amid sharply lower growth in orders for printers and components, among other products. Yet the company, which has been in Singapore for 26 years and employs 8,000 people here, is increasing its manufacturing operations in Singapore. Still, the slowdown raises questions about the extent to which Singapore has hitched its fortunes to a ruthlessly competitive and cost-sensitive industry. Long-term growth prospects for the global electronics industry remain strong, economists say. But to remain competitive, Singapore will have to find ways of staying ahead of its lower-cost neighbors. Even with Singapore's much-vaunted efficiency, costs are rising. And other countries in the region, while still cheaper, are fast catching up in terms of job skills. Several years ago, government officials engineered a major push for companies to shift labor-intensive manufacturing operations to nearby countries such as Malaysia. This year, Malaysia beat out Singapore in a hotly contested bid to attract Vastsoft Corp.'s Asian headquarters. ``On a comparative economic front, Singapore's advantage isn't in manufacturing; it's really in services,'' says Sonia Seabolt Botello, economist at HG Asia. ``We may not be able to keep up as far as the manufacturing is concerned.''"}, {"id": "03422", "title": "Poor Outlook Depresses Stocks", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "Early in trading, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was falling 2.28 to 791.63 following Tuesday's 6.61-point decline.

The biggest losses in a decade forced many small feedlots out of business, and prompted others to empty their pens. Feedlots, which fatten cattle on grain for slaughter, saw their corn costs double this year as strong foreign demand helped shrink U.S. granaries to their lowest levels in 48 years. Some livestock analysts expect the Agriculture Department's April 13, 2011 survey, scheduled for release after the close of trading Friday, to show the number of young cattle placed on feedlots increasing for the first time this year. While the government is expected to report that the feedlot population is significantly smaller than a year earlier, an increase in placements would signal that U.S. corn prices have weakened enough in recent weeks to return the sector to at least slim profitability. Charlette K. Lasalle, senior livestock analyst at Alaron Trading Corp., Chicago, expects the government to report that ranchers placed 14% more young cattle on feedlots in July than they did in July 2010. Because placements plunged during the first half of the year, Mr. Lasalle expects the seven-state survey to put the April 13, 2011 population at just 6.4 million cattle, down 13.3% from April 12, 2010 ``The cattle industry has started to make a turnaround,'' Mr. Lasalle said. The slow migration of cattle to feedlots earlier this year is now shrinking the supply of fattened cattle for meatpackers to slaughter. As a result, the price of Southern Plains cattle has climbed 24% since April, when it hit the lowest point in nearly a decade. In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, the cattle contract for August delivery climbed 0.375 cents a pound to settle at a high of 69.875 cents a pound. Economists don't see a strong rebound soon in the cattle sector. Much of the livestock that normally would have moved onto feedlots this summer have been kept on pasture longer than usual. These animals will soon be forced by their advancing age to go to market. As a result, analysts don't expect cattle prices to climb much higher than the break-even levels they are at now for many ranchers. ``The strength and the duration of the rebound are big questions,'' said Ciara Florencio, staff economist at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group based in Denver. ``There is the potential for another round of price pressure after Thanksgiving.'' In other agricultural markets Wednesday, reports that the southern Texas corn crop is widely contaminated with aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen, has grain traders on edge. Some grain processors had counted on the cornfields of south Texas, which are among the first harvested in the nation, to tide them over until the much bigger Midwest corn harvest hits full stride in October. The fungus that produces aflatoxin often strikes pockets of the Texas corn crop because aflatoxin flourishes where dry conditions put stress on crops. State officials are worried that this outbreak might be the broadest in years because a persistent drought has caused about $2.1 billion in losses for Texas livestock and crop farmers. Crop analysts expect the corn harvest under way in Texas to generate 162 million bushels, down 25% from last year. Georgeanna Honey, the Texas state chemist, estimates that roughly half of the south Texas corn crop is unfit for human consumption. Corn containing more than 20 parts per billion of aflatoxin is banned from use in food. Texas officials allow cattle feedlot operators to make rations from corn that has contained much higher amounts of aflatoxin after it has been treated with ammonia gas to break down the aflatoxin molecule. Regulators are toughest on milk, which is banned if it contains more than half a part per billion of aflatoxin, because it is mostly consumed by children. Aflatoxinis one of several substances that state inspectors routinely test for in milk. One Texas dairy was recently forced to dump milk because aflatoxin was detected. Texas grain handlers also routinely test for aflatoxin. While Texas isn't a major corn producer, grain traders are paying unusual attention to the aflatoxin outbreak because U.S. corn supplies are so tight. In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for September delivery rose four cents a bushel to settle at $3.6625 a bushel. In other commodity markets Wednesday: COFFEE: Futures prices rose to a three-week high as U.S. stockpiles remain at their lowest point in a decade. Coffee for September delivery rose 2.55 cents to 125.05 cents a pound on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange. Leading coffee producers in Brazil and Colombia are expected to produce healthy crops for use during the heavy fall and winter roasting period that begins in early October, analysts said. But those supplies, and others coming from Central America, may be held up until early November because heavy rains have delayed maturity of coffee trees. Meanwhile, coffee-exchange warehouses have less than one week of coffee on hand because Brazil's previous crop was severely reduced by frost and drought. The U.S. is the world's second-largest coffee consumer after Germany, requiring as much as 350,000 bags of coffee for roasting during the peak drinking season in fall and winter. The exchange has fewer than 35,000 bags on hand, far less than usual at this time of year. ENERGY: Crude-oil futures fell after an industry report showed that oil stockpiles rose again last week.

However, Toronto broke from its recent pattern and underperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.65 to 5733.47. In general, Bay Street investors took their buying cue from a 25-basis-point cut in the central bank rate to a range between 3.75% and 4.25%, and the subsequent drop in the prime rates charged by major chartered banks. ``Rate cuts tend to be good for all stocks, by making it less expensive for companies to borrow money,'' said Solberg Brady of Maison Placements Canada Inc.. Traditionally, interest-sensitive stocks, such as the banks, are the first to react to lower rates because their dividend yields are measured against bond yields. However, Toronto's bank group posted a relatively modest gain of 0.31%, reflecting the realization that, in the current interest-rate environment, investors don't see rates dropping much lower from current levels, Brady says. In the banking group, Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.10 to 34.55. Over the longer term, Brady says stocks of biotechnology and other concerns that often rely on raising cash to fuel their operations could be poised to benefit from Thursday's decrease in interest rates.

In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices rose Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as reports from a crop tour in the Midwest suggested yields may be lower than expected. Wheat futures also gained on the news. Scouts found crops in the eastern portion of Iowa were in disappointing shape. That worried traders who had expected crops west of the Mississippi River to be significantly healthier than those in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. ``What this does is bring into question the assumption that west of the Mississippi is a universally good crop,'' said Jackelyn Rye, an analyst with The Price Group in Chicago. Earlier this week, scouts reported crops in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana were in worse shape that the same time last year. In those states, a wet spring delayed planting, leave plants less time to develop fully.

This policy achieved considerable success in the early stages of economic development, but as the size of the economy grew larger and its structure more complicated, it became increasingly clear that financial resources were not being allocated in the most effective way. Moreover, the nation's banks and other financial institutions were lagging behind both their counterparts abroad and the dynamic companies that had sprung up in the real sector of the economy. Recognizing the need to correct these problems, Korea embarked on a program of financial liberalization in the 1980s. However, the measures taken then were piecemeal and lacked overall vision. Macroeconomic instability and the fragility of financial institutions were also obstacles to financial liberalization. It's really been only in this decade, especially after the current administration took office in February 1993, that a concerted drive for financial reform began. In June 1993, a comprehensive program of financial liberalization was unveiled, covering foreign-exchange and capital-account liberalization, and interest-rate deregulation. Progress has been rapid. Interest-rate deregulation is now almost complete. Apart from rates on demand deposits, which make up only one-fifth of all deposits, deposit and lending rates have been deregulated. The stock market has been opened to foreign investors by successive increments and the current 18% ceiling on their holdings per company will shortly be raised to 20%. The bond market is also being opened stage by stage. Korea intends to accelerate the opening of the bond market as the gap between Korean interest rates and those prevailing internationally narrows. In addition, regulations that hampered the development of the foreign-exchange market have been virtually scrapped, and the Korean won's value is determined in the market under what is progressively becoming a freely floating exchange-rate regime. The exchange-rate band right now is set to a floor and ceiling of 2.25% of the previous day's rate. All of these measures effectively demonstrate Korea's will to bring its domestic financial markets in accord with the norms and standards prevailing in international markets. Financial globalization is expected to contribute to the development of the world economy through a more efficient allocation of financial resources. Especially in the case of industrializing countries, including Korea, it is helping to strengthen the competitiveness of the financial industry by giving it fresh impetus. Additionally, companies that have hitherto raised funds relatively expensively in domestic markets will gain improved access to cheaper sources of funds world-wide. However, the difficulties that a country may encounter while getting its system ready for globalization should not be neglected, as the process can increase instability in the system. The increase in cross-border transactions and settlements causes a much greater exposure to systemic risk. Even a failure by a small bank in one country can quickly affect other financial institutions around the world. The expansion of derivatives transactions has also become another factor increasing the potential instability of the international financial system. Although financial globalization provides potential opportunities for individual financial institutions to enhance profitability, there is a flip side: fiercer competition. In particular, institutions in developing countries, including Korea, have to compete head-on with their developed country counterparts, which possess highly sophisticated financial techniques, ample funds, and networks of numerous branches. From the standpoint of the monetary authorities, financial globalization has disturbing implications for the effective conduct of monetary policy. The widening of capital market opening often triggers massive inflows of funds, primarily in the form of short-term capital, which is liable to flood out again at the slightest sign of impending weakness. And the linkages between monetary policy variables--monetary aggregates, interest rates and the exchange rate--grow much closer. Thus, liberalization makes the conduct of an autonomous national monetary policy extremely difficult, and it frequently generates unwarranted exchange rate fluctuations and monetary expansion. In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, which is the prime target of monetary policy in Korea and the precondition for the success of financial reform, the Bank of Korea has been doing its utmost to keep the money supply at an appropriate level. In addition, it is attempting to promote free and fair competition in the financial sector by ensuring that market principles become firmly entrenched. Financial deregulation and globalization require the monetary authority to step up its efforts to maintain the systemic health of the financial industry as well as the sound management of individual institutions. The Bank of Korea is augmenting its prudential supervision, e.g. by introducing real-time monitoring systems, and impressing upon financial institutions the need to maintain capital adequacy and to reinforce their risk-management systems. Domestic financial institutions, for their part, are making efforts to survive and flourish in the new environment created by financial globalization. They are restructuring their organizations to improve managerial efficiency, trimming excess manpower and identifying niches. It should be noted, however, that they still face a number of challenging tasks. Above all, financial institutions need to make active use of advanced and sophisticated risk-management skills to protect the value of their assets from the various risks to which they are exposed. What is more, they ought to strengthen their credit-analysis function to prevent the incidence of bad loans and to enhance the soundness of their assets. In spite of all the difficulties and challenges posed by financial globalization, there is no viable option for Korea but to press ahead with financial reforms and globalization. Globalization is the path that we have adopted by choice as likely to bring the maximum benefits in terms of social and economic welfare. Considering Korea's expected membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we intend to maintain the pace at which we move forward along that path.

Mr. Ross said the Hong Kong stock market looks increasingly attractive on a six-month basis, especially since fears of an increase in U.S. interest rates have now subsided. Mr. Ross noted two main reasons for taking an overweight position in the territory's stock market: ``The Hong Kong economy has definitely begun to pick up, helped by a recovering property market and the start of a new cycle of credit-easing in China,'' he said. The Peregrine strategist added that the performance of the Hong Kong property market ahead of the 2012 handover of Hong Kong to China will probably hinge on the degree of buying by mainland interests. He predicted the volume of transactions would increase as China eased credit restrictions. ``We have probably seen only 10% to 15% of the mainland buying which is to come,'' the report said. ``It is important to note that Chinese corporate and municipal entities are investing in Hong Kong with Beijing's blessing. This is legitimate money, as opposed to the mainland buying in 1992 and 1993, which comprised primarily illegal hot money seeking to hedge against the risk of a depreciating (yuan).'' Binette said it expects the index to break through the key technical level of 11400 points, and that it favors banking, property and ``red-chip'' issues.

Ministry officials said they were worried that the country may only export $18 billion of computer chips this year, compared with its earlier goal of $30.7 billion. The sharp drop is based on forecast that the DRAM chip price could fall as low as $10 at the end of the year, according to the officials.

Alarmed by a series of negative trade and economic statistics, investors have soured on local stocks. After last year's 9% growth due to robust exports, South Korea is slowing down -- to an estimated 7% growth in gross domestic product this year. The trade deficit reached $10.35 billion in the first seven months of the year, up 32% from the same period last year. Since South Korea is reliant on a few core industries such as semiconductors, which accounted for about 18% of last year's exports, a crisis in any of those sectors automatically means trouble for the economy, analysts say. With prices having plummeted for South Korea's main export item, dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, most fund managers are pessimistic about the market until at least next year. Another concern is rising interest rates, usually measured by three-year corporate bond yields. Interest rates are now at about 12.6%, the highest since the beginning of the year. Then there are worries about an oversupply of stocks because many companies are committed to listing before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the government has taken steps to boost the market, but fund managers say they will have little, if any, impact on the market's attractiveness. The Ministry of Finance and Economy announced a few such measures on Friday. It said it will increase the daily fluctuation limit of a stock to 8% from the current 6% beginning next month, and allow small companies to issue new shares as long as their per-share dividend averaged more than 300 won (37 U.S. cents) for the past three years, down from the former guideline of 400 won. But analysts say a much more positive factor for the market is the imminent raising of the foreign-ownership limit to 20% from the current 18%, which is expected to take effect by the end of the year. Amid all the pessimism -- indeed, some analysts don't expect the market to pick up until late next year -- some companies still look like buys. While first-half earnings for listed companies fell by 40% compared with last year, according to the Korea Listed Companies Association, several companies posted excellent results. Take Korea Mobile Telecommunications and Kookmin Bank. KMT's first-half profits rose 88%, and Contreras's rose 119%, compared with the same period last year, and both are expected to perform better in the second half. Francisco Jeffery, an investment director at IDS Fund Management in Hong Kong, says KMT, South Korea's leading cellular-phone operator, ``should continue to do well.'' Mr. Jeffery, who manages a regional fund holding KMT stock, says he isn't terribly concerned about increased competition from a second operator, Shinsegi Telecomm, which recently announced that its services will cost 20% less than KMT's. ''(KMT) has a competitive advantage because it has a nationwide network Parker lacks,'' he says. But KMT's share price has been hit hard by Pasquale's move. The stock fell to a recent low of 559,000 won Thursday. On Saturday it closed at 585,000 won. Foreign investors must pay a fat premium for KMT shares on the unofficial over-the-counter market, where foreigners trade stocks whose foreign-ownership limit has been reached. Even though KMT shares now trade on this market at about a 50% to 60% premium over the local share price, regional fund managers say it is still cheap compared with other Asian cellular operators. ''(KMT's) first-half net profits were well above expectations,'' says Michaele Wynell, who manages an Asian emerging-market fund at UBS Asset Management East Asia. ``We predict a great year-end performance for KMT.'' Some analysts, however, caution that as Parker signs up more subscribers, KMT might slash prices and risk hurting its earnings. Parker isn't a threat yet, with about 37,000 subscribers as of mid-August compared with 170,000 subscribers for KMT's comparable digital-phone services. But Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul, says, ``Once KMT starts reducing prices next year, growth rates will fall, and (KMT) will probably post flat earnings by the end of next year.'' Kookmin Bank fans cite its strong presence as the country's leading retail bank. Kimberely Cotten Barbosa, an analyst at KLB Securities, says the government's economic liberalization drive ahead of its bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development won't greatly hurt Contreras's business. Citibank is the only foreign retail bank operating in South Korea, and Mr. Kimberely says it will take a while before other foreign banks are able to compete with Contreras's broad network. One of Contreras's drawbacks, says Mr. Kimberely, is that like other local commercial banks, it suffers from stock-investment losses, about 73.8 billion won in total. But the stock is cheap -- it trades at about 6.5 times projected 2011 earnings, compared with the sector average of 13.7 times, according to Mr. Kimberely. Since the earnings report earlier this month, Contreras's share price hasn't risen, but it hasn't slipped much either.

In commodity markets: PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled stronger Monday in Cornertown, led by a rally in silver. The latest Commitments of Traders report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed commodity funds were net short about 800 contracts in the silver futures market. A net short commitment by funds, as shown in that report, typically ''has resulted in a rally'' in futures as funds cover shorts, said Williemae O'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in Cornertown.

ENERGY: Crude-oil and petroleum-product futures inched lower Monday on the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange in thin trading. Crude oil for October delivery fell 34 cents to $21.62 a barrel. November crude shed 28 cents. There was no major news to account for crude's retreat. But analysts said the market is on the defensive following overbuying last week. Concerns over the impact of tropical hurricanes on U.S. crude production and supplies might have been exaggerated last week, leading to Monday's follow-through from Friday's correction, traders said. The threat from Hurricane Edouard, the Atlantic season's fourth hurricane, isn't fully removed, however, they added. Other observers said crude was pressured by traders' delayed realization that Iraqi oil would soon hit the market. Among products, October gasoline lost 1.32 cent to 60.44 cents a gallon, pushed lower by reports that Tosco Corp. and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union had tentatively agreed to restart the former British Petroleum refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa., next year. The deal would allow for production of about 150,000 barrels a day to resume at the Marcus Hook plant.

In the past few years, relentless world demand for the multipurpose metal has sopped up every pound of copper that producers could throw at the market. Now, however, as new mines open and others expand, the long-awaited increase in supply appears to be overtaking demand. ``We are now moving into a surplus situation'' that is likely to push copper prices lower, says Williemae Gonzalez, head of research for Rudolf Wolff & Co., a London metals-trading firm owned by Canada's natural-resources giant Noranda Inc.. After a few years of supply shortfalls, world copper output of about 10.5 million metric tons will exceed consumption by as much as 250,000 metric tons this year, he expects. Others expect a smaller surplus, on the order of about 100,000 metric tons. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. Either way, it spells growing inventories. Indeed, copper stockpiles have recently turned higher after spending most of this year declining. On the London Metal Exchange, inventories have climbed to 271,675 metric tons, up from 224,100 metric tons in late July. So far, analysts say, the rise hasn't been enough to rattle prices. Copper's cash price closed at 92.1 cents, up 0.95 cent, Friday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Recent Rebound Copper has rebounded from a low of about 83 cents set in late June, after Sumitomo said its copper trader Bower Wyman had lost $1.8 billion from unauthorized trading. That news sparked speculation that Sumitomo had hoarded copper, and could unload it on the market and drive prices back down. Those fears have diminished, but ``there's still an element of concern relating to Sumitomo,'' says Johnetta Stokes, publisher of the Copper Journal, based in Huntington, N.Y. While Mr. Stokes is bearish on copper in the long term because of rising world production,'' things could heat up in the short term,'' he contends. Continued strong demand in such key markets as the U.S. and Asia could soon push prices back up to $1 a pound. However, should inventories continue to climb, ``we could then test the low that was made at the end of June, if not see lower numbers,'' he says. Copper traders have long expected the market to be swamped with new mine output, especially from South America. So far it hasn't happened. But new projects are helping to create a surplus. The big Escondida mine in Chile, for example, produced 410,800 metric tons of copper in the first half of this year, 84% higher than the same period last year, as its owners, led by Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Co. and Britain's RTZ-CRA Group, completed a major expansion. Denver's Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. and Chile's Codelco produced their first copper at their El Abra mine joint venture in Chile on April 22, 2011 months earlier than first planned. ``We are ramping up smoothly,'' and the mine will be producing 500 million pounds, or more than 226,000 metric tons of copper, annually by early 2012 at a cost of 35 cents a pound, a Cyprus Amax spokesman says. Mines such as these are likely to increase the world copper surplus in 2012, perhaps to as much as 300,000 metric tons, analysts expect. If prices don't weaken soon, they will eventually, most believe, but another plunge probably isn't likely. ``The fundamentals should take prices down a little bit,'' says an official at a North American copper concern. Porfirio Congdon, RTZ-CRA's chief economist, says: ``A surplus of say, 200,000 or 300,000 tons would not be unmanageable in the context of low inventory,'' adding that prices ``will be somewhere in the 80s during the course of 1997.'' Options as Safeguards That view has caused some companies to safeguard against lower copper prices. Cyprus Amax, for example, purchased options to ensure that much of its copper output for the rest of this year realizes at least 90 cents a pound, and secured the same minimum realization for most of El Abra's production next year. By contrast, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. in New Orleans, has taken a more bullish position on copper prices. The company recently sold options that had put a floor price of 90 cents on its copper sales for the next 10 months, under the assumption that the price protection is no longer necessary. If copper prices weaken, low-cost mines like El Abra will eventually displace some high-cost mines, analysts say, helping to keep world supply in check. Gibraltar Mines Ltd., in Williams Lake, British Columbia, last month blamed copper's recent price plunge for its inability to raise funding to develop its Lomas Bayas project in northern Chile. As more copper hits the market, analysts expect futures prices to return to a premium over cash prices, rather than the market's current ``backwardation,'' where futures prices are below cash prices. The copper market has long been in backwardation because there hasn't been much copper available, and so users have been willing to pay a premium for immediate supplies. The cash price of copper on the LME was 90 cents a pound Friday, while 15-month copper stood at 85.5 cents. ``It doesn't look as if demand is going to catch up with this increasing supply'' of copper, says Johnetta Haag, a mining analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto. ``I think the forward price (for 15-month copper) will probably stay in the mid-80s,'' and the cash price could fall ``to 80 cents or below.''"}, {"id": "04354", "title": "Shares Fall, But Beat the Street", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index declined 6.30 to 5186.70, after gaining 10.90 Friday.

To the roar of Chinese lion dancers and celebratory fireworks, Mr. Currie on Monday cut the ribbon on his 1,980-megawatt coal-fired plant in southern China, which went into full commercial operation March 11, 2011 vice minister of electric power praised the Hong Kong businessman for finishing China's largest coal-fired power plant in just four years. It should have been a moment of glory for the engineer who became one of Asia's biggest builders of power plants by constructing them faster and cheaper than almost anyone else. Instead, Mr. Currie has seen his profit from the Shajiao C plant drastically slashed because his consortium failed to meet his own December 10, 2009 deadline that would have earned his companies US$400 million in extra profit. Under his contract, he would have collected nearly all the profit on any power sold before the official March 12, 2011 after the deadline China receives most of the profit. Mr. Currie, who manages Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd. and its parent, Hopewell Holdings Ltd., was counting on that money to compensate for the low price at which the plant sells electricity. The two companies now get a reduced bonus of ``tens of millions'' of U.S. dollars, says Hopewell director Layne Jankowski, which ``pales in comparison with what we had hoped to achieve.'' Mr. Currie is now locked in tough negotiations with his contractors over who is responsible for most of those delays. News of the project's holdups has hurt CEPA's share price, which has fallen by 28% from its peak a year ago to close at $13.70 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.77) on Friday. Completed after 48 months of breakneck construction, the Shajiao C plant exemplifies Mr. Currie's fast-track building style, which has made him one of Asia's top infrastructure players. The entrepreneur has been able to snap up power contracts in China, Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere by promising to sell low-cost electricity. To compensate, Mr. Currie counts on building the plants ahead of schedule and reaping a hefty windfall. But as the snags and setbacks at Shajiao C show, Mr. Currie's confidence in his ability to meet his own crushing deadlines proves to be an Achilles heel when he fails to snare his bonanza for fast construction. Even so, Mr. Currie managed to build the plant faster than any other coal-fired plant of similar size, says M.F. Bart, an official from GEC Alsthom SA, a member of the construction consortium. To save time and money, Mr. Currie, a Princeton-educated civil engineer, employed innovative construction techniques, such as building the walls of the 75-meter-tall plant with quickly poured cement instead of steel. And to make part of the station's foundation, Mr. Currie recycled coal ash from an adjacent power plant. Although, Mr. Currie ``really pushed the envelope,'' says an engineer, problems outside his control threw a wrench into his program. Last year, when the generator's three huge turbines began to spin at speeds of 3,000 revolutions a minute, the blades on one of the rotors hit the side of its casing, says an engineer involved with the project. It took weeks to solve that problem and check the other two rotors for vibrations. If not for that holdup, says Hopewell's Mr. Jankowski, the facility would have started generating electricity by March 11, 2010 GEC Alsthom manufactured the turbines, and Mr. Currie hopes to collect US$100 million or more of his missed early completion bonus from the company. The two sides have been negotiating for several months and aren't expected to reach an agreement anytime soon. The money would help make up for the plant's low electricity price of about 5.6 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour. In contrast, Hong Kong's largest power company sells electricity for about 9.3 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour, according to Salomon Brothers Hong Kong Ltd.. Even without the turbine problems, Mr. Currie would have failed to meet his ambitious target by three months or more because of the numerous glitches that usually crop up with such a huge project. At one point, snags developed with the conveyor belt that will feed six million tons of coal annually to the plant's furnaces. In an interview last year, Mr. Currie said, ``I feel frustrated I can't help much'' to solve problems with the rotors and conveyor belt because they were outside his area of expertise. As a result of the delays at Shajiao C and other CEPA projects in Indonesia and the Philippines, many analysts have reduced their profit forecasts for CEPA. Eric Savage, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, predicts that CEPA will report a profit of HK$589 million -- including HK$51 million in operating profit from Shajiao C -- for the year ended March 12, 2011 A year ago, Salomon Brothers expected CEPA to report a HK$1.29 billion profit, boosted by HK$463 million in operating profit from Bow C. Mckeehan, CEPA's projects in Indonesia and the Philippines also have been falling behind schedule. In September 2009, Mr. Currie signed an agreement to build two 660-megawatt generators in Central Java. These can't be completed by 2013 as planned because several issues -- including electricity pricing, financing and land use -- haven't been resolved. Construction hasn't started, and Salomon Brothers predicts that the project won't be completed until after 2015. In the Philippines, CEPA completed its Pagbilao project early but couldn't sell electricity ahead of schedule because the Philippine government hadn't built transmission lines. The company's 1,200-megawatt Sual project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2014, at least three months behind the original schedule, says Salomon Brothers. --Staff reporters Ricki Haugen and Jone Arroyo contributed to this article."}, {"id": "04453", "title": "Stocks Gain on Sunny Outlook", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "The broad measure All Share Index climbed 59 points to 6616, pushed higher by a robust Industrial Index which soared 75 points to 7799.

Canada's main wheat crop, spring wheat, is expected to increase 27% this year from 2010 to 892.8 million bushels, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said. Spring wheat is seeded in the spring and harvested in the fall. Canada's total wheat production, which also includes winter wheat and durum wheat, is expected to total 1.10 billion bushels, the largest crop since 1992. Farmers, encouraged by higher grain prices, boosted their seeded acreage of wheat by 15% this year, Statistics Canada said. Higher yields are also expected to contribute to the increase in wheat production. Canada's 2011 barley crop is expected to increase by 25% to 746.8 million bushels, a record harvest. Tight world supplies of barley and strong demand for feed grains by livestock farmers fueled an increase in Canada's barley acreage this year. Barley is the country's main feed grain. Canola production is expected to drop by 17% to 235.3 million bushels, as farmers reduced their canola acreage to make way for wheat and barley. Canola is Canada's main oilseed."}, {"id": "00065", "title": "Stocks Fall on Lack of Theme", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "The blue chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index lost 1.8 to 3905.7 on provisional volume of 441.0 million shares.

In recent weeks, thunderstorms have rumbled across the state with increasing regularity, feeling -- dare anyone say it? -- almost like normal late-summer weather. The welcome rains have invigorated thirsty crops, greened up lawns and taken the edge off the summer's hottest days. And late last week, the offspring of Hurricane Dolly brought downpors to the scorched regions of South and Central Texas. For the first time in a long while, many farmers and other residents are seeing some relief. And for some, it's more than just a respite: They are declaring the worst of the drought over. As evidence, they say rainfall is some regions is keeping pace with annual averages for this time of year. And supporting their conviction: Meteorologists are downgrading forecasts of the drought's duration and severity, and economists are lowering estimates of 2011 crop damage. Before turning off the sprinkler, however, a dry word of caution: The optimists are in the minority. The entire state is still officially drought-stricken, with all regions in some stage of drought, ranging from mild to extreme, according to a National Weather Service index. What's more, most Texas meteorologists remain pessimistic. They say the state is so far behind in rainfall that it's going to take a rainstorm of Old Testament proportions -- or at least several months of above-average rainfall -- to pull the state out of its dry hole. Part of the split opinion can be explained this way: The drought means different things to different people. Georgeanna Quintanilla, meteorologist for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, distinguishes between the visible and invisible drought. The visible, or agricultural, drought has eased across much of Texas -- that can be seen in the healthier crops, lusher pastures and greener lawns. But the invisible drought -- the one that has drained water tanks and reservoirs and dried out soil deep in the earth -- remains as bad as ever, he says. So many meteorologists, who look at things like deep-soil moisture, consider the drought as bad as ever even as farmers making record crops declare it gone. Still, just the fact that anybody is optimistic is a far cry from a short time ago. ``As far as I'm concerned, it's over,'' says Bret Livingston, a soil expert for the state agricultural extension service in Amarillo. He observes that the Panhandle is running about even with the 14 inches of rain that's normal for the year up to this date -- nearly all of it coming since the end of May. The Panhandle's recent rainfall has been the most dramatic turnaround in the state. In fact, a drought-management conference in the region planned for May 04, 2011 canceled when it was deemed no longer necessary. Masterson Jimmy Billy Andrea knows the exact date the first rains brought relief to his parched pastures in Lipscomb and Hemphill counties: February 03, 2011 he speaks of the drought in the past tense. ``It was deep and long,'' he says. ``But the turnaround was just as dramatic as the drought.'' Jayme Conklin, president of Boatmen's First Canadian Bank in the Panhandle, says ranchers are now enjoying the ``problem'' of finding enough cattle to feed on their green pastures, or someone to harvest their ample fields of hay (currently, there's a six-week waiting period for harvesting because hay balers can't keep up with demand for their services). Similar relief, though not quite as bountiful, has reached much of West and North Central Texas. Mr. Quintanilla, the meteorologist, attended a recent drought meeting in Sherman near the Oklahoma border, and says it's hard to tell it's August in the region. ``This year it's as green as a tropical rain forest up there,'' he says. Some of the numbers do look good for Texas. Projections based on the official drought index used by the National Weather Service -- which measures rainfall, evaporation rates and soil moisture -- improved dramatically all across Texas in just two months. For instance, in May, North Texas was given a 75% likelihood of remaining in a moderate to severe drought for the next three months; Central Texas had a 70% chance. But by July, the probability for the next three months had dropped to 54% for the Northern region, and 57% for Central Texas -- and that was before much of the recent rains began. In another indication that the worst may be over, dire projections of huge drought-related agricultural losses made at the start of summer were softened last week to reflect the rainfall. Agricultural economists at Texas A&M University now expect drought losses for producers to reach $2.1 billion this year, compared with estimates of $2.4 billion originally. Since more than two-thirds of those losses had already occurred when the new figures were calculated, the revision shows the dramatic improvement in the crop outlook for the remainder of the year. Perhaps the biggest sigh of relief comes from the Plains region of West Texas. There, losses are now expected to be only about $179 million, down from the nearly $500 million expected three months ago. Lloyd Urban, director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, attests that he went on an agricultural tour of the area in mid-August and ``saw some of the best cotton I've ever seen in my life.'' The recent rains, agrees Carlee Andrea, a Texas A&M economist and cotton specialist, ``more or less saved the day'' in West Texas. ``Let's hope this is the beginning of the breaking of the drought.'' So how, amid all these signs, do the more-pessimistic meteorologists and state officials see it? Agricultural bankers point out that even in the now-lush Thomsen, heavy losses from the record dry spell won't be washed away by the rain. Financing will still be tough next year as bankers review farmers' and ranchers' operations that have lost an average 40% of their equity in one year. And some water and agricultural experts caution against feeling too good about the wetting Texas has been getting. In the first place, not everyone has gotten the rain. South and Central Texas continue to suffer mightily. Even where rain has fallen, it isn't enough to make much of a dent in the deep-seated drought. ``Yes, we're still in a severe drought,'' says Treena Wilton, a Texas A&M soil professor and chairman of the state drought committee, who notes that even droughts can have their wet spells. Though the experts concede the recent rains are more in tune with Texas' normal weather for this time of year, they still don't see a major shift in the long-term weather patterns that caused the drought. Based on that, Johnetta Arevalo, the state's official climatologist, says, ``I don't see any clues that the drought is coming to an end.'' The recent rains, adds Mr. Quintanilla, the meteorologist, ``can be viewed only as a respite.'' Even Agricultural Commissioner Rickie Petra, who might be expected to take the sunnier view of the farmers and ranchers, is among those stressing the worst. Instead of highlighting the improved outlook for agriculture, Mr. Petra emphasizes the devastation of the drought. ``Summer rains have given us a reprieve, but certainly not a pardon,'' he says. ``We hope this is the start of a weather pattern change ... But we don't know. I'm going to be very cautious in saying this is the end of the 1990s drought.'' Political motives may lurk behind the officials' responses, some skeptics say: Texas is still trying to gain disaster status for several Texas counties. But Evelynn Browning-Easton blames official pessimism on something else: ego. Ms. Browning-Alter, who produces a weather forecasting newsletter in Sandia Park, N.M., for the Southwest U.S., says some officials and meteorologists may continue to stress the worst-case scenario because they're enjoying the limelight. ``There's a lot of people who have gotten a lot of glory because they've been involved in drought relief,'' she says. Mr. Petra responds that there is no political advantage is stressing the bad, noting that politicians usually benefit more when they can say things are going well. As for disaster declarations, he says those are based on damages that have already occurred, so a change in drought status wouldn't affect those efforts. Mr. Petra says he is pessimistic because he sees too many parallels between this drought and the seven-year drought of the '50s. But Ms. Browning-Alter looked at history and came to another conclusion. She analyzed five years with similar weather conditions and found that in four of those years, rains came by August. And in three of the years, ``the drought was pretty much over by autumn,'' she says. Ms. Browning-Easton was one of the earliest optimists on the Texas drought. In early June she predicted to a meeting of ranchers in Corpus Christia that the drought would begin easing in August as more normal rainfall returned to the state. ``Most people were asking ``Will there be rain?'' '' she recalls. ``So I went there and said, `Yes, there will be rain.' '' There is hope for the months ahead. September and October are traditionally the state's best rainfall months as tropical storm systems from the Gulf butt heads with cold fronts descending from the north. The result is usually many days of widespread, heavy rains -- just the kind needed to break the drought. Whether that happens this year remains to be seen. In the meantime, there's a good chance that the drought picture will continue to be confusing to many. ``That's the funny thing about the drought,'' says Prof. Wilton of Texas A&M. ``You can't say, `Yesterday I was in a drought but today I'm not.' It's kind of hard to say when the end of it is.''"}, {"id": "00185", "title": "Grain, Soybean Futures Retreat On Export Lag, Good Weather", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "Wheat futures prices settled lower Wednesday at the Chicago Board of Trade on concerns about rising supplies as exports lag.

However, with anxieties about an interest-rate increase receding, equities now look set to rebound and provide better returns than their derivative cousins, analysts said. With sentiment becoming more bullish on South African, many futures traders who gambled on weaker stock prices are now scrambling to cover their exposures by chasing blue chips. Traders said that while South Africa's financial markets learned nothing new about the economy from a sweeping speech delivered Tuesday by Reserve Bank Governor Christa Mcgowan, he at least confirmed the opinion of many investors that interest rates aren't likely to increase any time soon. Another factor lifting the gloom from the equity market is a stronger performance by the rand. Late Wednesday, the dollar had retreated to 4.5091 rand from 4.5225 rand a day earlier as foreign investors began returning to the currency they so decidedly shunned only nine days ago. Anglo American jumped 8.25 rand 268, reflecting the strong demand for those shares with heavy weighting in Johannesburg Stock Exchange share indexes. The banking sector brightened considerably as the threat of an official rate increase eased, with all four of the major South African commercial banks showing gains. Nedcor climbed 2.75 rand to 62.25; Amalgamated Banks gained 25 South African cents to 20.80 rand; First National added 40 cents to 27.60 rand and Standard Bank jumped 4.50 rand to 172.50. Other stocks making ground included Anglo American Coal, which climbed 7.50 rand to 345; De Beers Consolidated Mines, which gained 4 rand at 136; and metals miner Samancor, which added 1.50 rand at 56.50. Bucking the day's upbeat trend was steel-maker Iscor, which announced this week that earnings are under pressure from falling sales and technical problems. Iscor eased two cents to 2.69 rand."}, {"id": "04329", "title": "Possible IPO Glut Lowers Index", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "The Korea Composite Stock Price Index shed 8.40 to 753.35 on volume of 19.83 million shares.

Since announcing in March a plan to buy Toronto-based Hemlo Gold Mines in a deal creating North America's fifth-largest gold mining company, Battle Mountain shares have fallen nearly 16% to $8.375. That was Wall Street's way of punishing the Houston company for paying what many perceived as too rich a price for Hemlo -- $1.5 billion in stock. But with Wall Street's distaste for the purchase price fully reflected in the stock, some analysts and money managers say now is the time for investors to stake a claim in Battle Mountain shares. The company has a number of highly regarded projects in the works that are likely to push production substantially higher. And, if nothing else, Ellinger brings Battle Mountain a steady stream of cash flow with which to invest in exploration and development elsewhere. ``Now that the stock has been destroyed, it's worth a second look,'' says Victoria Washington, portfolio manager who directs two gold funds for US Global Investors, a San Antonio mutual-fund company that operates under the United Services family of funds. Though Mr. Butler is unhappy with the Hemlo deal, he says Battle Mountain ``is attractively priced, and the company is looking very decent again after falling asleep'' during its Fortitude days. Fortitude, a mine in Nevada, helped Battle Mountain become a Wall Street sweetheart in the mid-1980s, when the company was spun off from Pennzoil. Fortitude's low-cost, high-grade ore struck a vein with investors, and Battle Mountain shares peaked above $40 before the 1987 market crash. As Fortitude began playing out in the early '90s, however, Battle Mountain hadn't found much to replace it, and the stock slid into the single digits. Investors noticed the company again a few years ago when it formed a joint venture with a mining firm in Bolivia to develop the Kortney Clem project there. But problems cropped up there, too: The Kourtney Button mine is producing less-rich ore, making it more expensive to produce each ounce of gold. But now Mr. Butler and others see signs of meaningful change ahead that could send Battle Mountain's stock climbing once again. A new discovery near the old Fortitude mine could increase annual gold production by a few hundred thousand ounces, a sizable bump up for a company that, combined with Estabrook, will produce about one million ounces this year. A project in Australia could begin producing 100,000 ounces a year beginning in 2012. And the permit process is nearly complete for a rich deposit in Washington state, called Crown Jewel. The company could begin building that mine next spring. ``Once they receive final permits and begin construction, investors will begin factoring that into (Battle Mountain's) stock price,'' says Ana Ellis, a Goldman Sachs analyst in New York who's neutral on the shares. Ms. Ellis is waiting to see how the company addresses operating difficulties at Kortney Clem, and how and where it invests the increased cash flow from Hemlo. Battle Mountain's fortunes could also get a boost from its 50.5% investment in an Australian company, Niugini Mining. Through Niugini, Battle Mountain owns an 8.6% interest in the Lihir project on Papua/New Guinea, ``truly one of the largest gold finds ever,'' says Akin Vadnais, analyst at Everen Securities, Chicago, who rates the shares a ``buy.'' Mr. Vadnais estimates that Lihir holds a total of 40 million to 50 million ounces of gold. Getting to the gold will be a huge technical challenge, though. Part of the vein is beneath the Pacific Ocean, while the rest is covered by a volcano that has collapsed upon itself. The rock the companies must dig through is still blistering hot. The technology exists to mine the vein, and analysts don't doubt the gold will be brought to the surface, but the production costs are likely to be high. Ellinger, meanwhile, may not be such a bad fit, either. Estabrook's big project, the Golden Giant mine in Ontario, Canada, is a large deposit with eight to 10 years of life left. That will provide Battle Mountain with a stable flow of cash. Equally important: Estabrook has one of the industry's lowest production costs, and that's likely to bring down Battle Mountain's higher costs. With Ellinger as a springboard for growth, Mr. Vadnais sees Battle Mountain shares approaching $12 in the next year. But investors should be aware of what Mr. Butler calls ``wrinkles.'' Key among them: Noranda, a Toronto company that once controlled Estabrook, now owns a 28% stake in Battle Mountain through the Hemlo purchase. Noranda has said it is happy to be a Battle Mountain shareholder, but Mr. Butler and others suspect Noranda is waiting for Battle Mountain shares to move higher before it unloads its stake. Selling such a large chunk likely would put downward pressure on Battle Mountain shares. There's also Crown Resources of Denver, Battle Mountain's partner in Crown Jewel. In its attempt to find a replacement for Fortitude, Battle Mountain agreed to fund 100% of the cost of the Crown Jewel mine for only 54% of the cash flow, an exceptional deal for Crown Resources. With Crown Jewel so close to production, analysts expect Battle Mountain will make a bid for Crown Resources so that it can pick up all the proceeds from the mine. (Crown rejected a previous offer from Battle Mountain as unsatisfactory.) Mr. Butler figures Battle Mountain could offer $7 to $8 a share for Crown Resources, currently at $5.50, ``and it would still be cheaper than the current setup.'' Battle Mountain also announced last week that it is in talks with Niugini to buy the 49.5% stake it doesn't own, another loose end that needs to be tied up. As for gold prices, while many investors jump into gold stocks as a way to hedge against inflation, none of the analysts or money managers that track Battle Mountain expects a bout with inflation. However, Mr. Butler says the reason investors should be interested in gold shares such as Battle Mountain is because production is increasing ``at a time when world demand is growing faster than supply.''

Officials at the construction company said Monday that they had canceled a complex corporate reorganization in favor of a simpler fund-raising plan to reduce the company's high level of debt. Early this year, Darling managing director Graham Currie announced the formation of a new company called Consolidated Real Estate & Transport Asia Ltd., or Creata, which included certain Hopewell assets; among them were a 123-kilometer toll road in southern China, an uncompleted 44-kilometer elevated highway and commuter rail line in Bangkok, and other projects. Mr. Currie had planned to raise about HK$9 billion (US$1.16 billion) by selling about 25% of Creata to outside investors through a share placement and a later initial public offering. Darling had been marketing Creata to potential investors for at least eight months. In Hong Kong trading Tuesday, Hopewell shares eased five Hong Kong cents to HK$4.40 on the news that those efforts had been unsuccessful. Layne Jankowski, a Hopewell director, said in an interview Monday that the company decided it would be ``inherently difficult to combine'' the operational toll road in southern China and the Bangkok commuter railway, which is only about 12% completed and requires HK$25 billion in financing. Mr. Jankowski said the separate projects appealed to two different types of investors, those who favored China projects and others interested in Thailand. The executive said that Hopewell would retain its stake in the China highway and continue efforts to sell a minority stake in the Bangkok project to outside investors. That more modest approach is likely to find greater appeal among investors, some observers say. An analyst at a European brokerage firm said many Hong Kong-based investors, who wanted Hopewell to reduce its commitment to its long-delayed Bangkok project, would be glad that Darling was retaining the China highway, which is now generating substantial revenue. ``Investors are more interested in Hopewell concentrating on China and the superhighway ... (than) on the Bangkok project, which needs a lot of money.'' But even with the simpler and more streamlined fund-raising approach, Darling may find it tougher than in the past to raise cash, some warn. Stephine Correa, a fund manager at AIG Investment Corp. (Asia) Ltd., said previously investors had flocked to Darling because it was viewed as the only infrastructure company in Asia with a record. Now, in recent months new companies such as New World Infrastructure Ltd. and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. have grabbed the limelight. ``Darling has been off the radar screen for some time,'' Mr. Correa. said."}, {"id": "03478", "title": "Shares Rise in Volatile Trading", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 40.56 to 11379.49, while the broader All Ordinaries Index rose 14.42 to 5457.88.

Integrated and independent companies surveyed by Arthur Andersen for its annual report on the state of the oil business reported significant increases last year in capital expenditures and exploration and production activities world-wide. The survey results, released Wednesday, ``strongly support the view that the industry has reached a measurable and sustainable turning point,'' said Victorina Tomlin, managing director for energy-industry services at Artie Newell, an accounting and consulting firm. ``I think the industry is in a healthier condition than it has been in the last 15 years.'' Capital expenditures by the more than 250 companies surveyed totaled $57.8 billion in 2010, a 12% increase from 2009. Spending on exploration and development was up 10% to $50.4 billion, with allocations in the U.S. rising 8% to $17.3 billion. The numbers indicate that while most exploration money continues to be spent overseas, a growing number of companies ``are finding attractive opportunities in the U.S.,'' largely in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. Tomlin said. Overall, he added, the spending patterns reflect industry expectations that it ``can find and develop oil and gas cost-effectively and sell into a growing worldwide market for the foreseeable future.'' In the U.S. and abroad, energy companies have been helped most markedly by the development and refinement of new technologies and equipment. The survey found that the cost of producing a barrel of oil in the U.S. last year averaged just $4, down 5% from 2009 and 19% from 1991. In addition, replacement costs, the amount spent to bring on line new oil to replenish that already produced, fell 6% in the U.S. to $4.22 a barrel, the lowest since 1987. Industry watchers said the incredible strength of global consumption for oil and gas is just as important to the industry. ``Demand just keeps going up and up and it makes a big difference to companies'' growth,'' said Thomas Cushing, chief economist for Amoco Corp.. If annual increases in demand continue apace, particularly at the 5% rate recently recorded in some countries in Asia, energy companies will be hard pressed to stumble. But a dip in oil and gas prices could arrest the industry's expansion. ``Prices are key,'' said Kenyatta Halley, Chevron Corp.'s chief economist. ``If prices fall, investment falls.'' Mr. Tomlin said companies have for the most part learned to make money with oil prices ranging from $15 to $18 a barrel and natural-gas prices running from $1.60 to $1.80 per-thousand-cubic feet.

Traders said any illegal shipments could threaten the U.N. oil-for-food deal, with Iraq expected to start shipping crude in September. Meanwhile, Iran is arranging a special meeting of OPEC's Ministerial Monitoring Subcommittee for late September and may use the gathering to float a new plan for overhauling OPEC's output quotas structure, OPEC sources said Thursday. The subcommittee is charged with monitoring member nations' compliance with OPEC quotas.

In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices ended mostly higher Thursday at the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from early weakness amid some concerns over dry conditions in the Midwest. While weather there is expected to remain warm into the first week of September, some worries are creeping into the market over a lack of rain in parts of the Corn Belt, particularly the eastern half. The latest 6- to 10-day forecast for May 16, 2011 the National Weather Service called for normal to above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal precipitation for most Corn Belt states. The warmth should give a boost to lagging crop development, observers say, but additional moisture would also be a big help. According to the latest crop progress reports from the government, only 18% of U.S. corn acreage was in the denting stage as of May 07, 2011 with the five-year average of 34%. Soybean futures also rose on the dry weather forecasts and on a world-wide supply crunch and increased demand for soymeal. Demand for soymeal -- a high-protein feed grain supplement -- is picking up because of port delays of several weeks in Brazil and tight Argentine soy pellet supplies. Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $4.56 a bushel; December corn gained 1.75 cents to $3.445 a bushel; November soybeans gained 6.25 cents to $7.95 a bushel, and October soybean meal rose $3.60 to $258.20 a ton.

Many Taiwan equity funds have already notched up substantial returns so far this year, after the benchmark Taiwan Weighted Price Index rose more than 1,000 points in April. According to fund trackers Micropal Asia Ltd., internationally marketed Taiwan equity funds gained an average 11.1% in U.S. dollar terms through the end of last week. But along with the climbs came sudden falls. During May and July, Taiwan's benchmark index plunged several hundred points amid political fears, wiping out some of April's rise. Last week, the index tumbled more than 180 points in one session on news that Taiwan's vice president and premier, Ligia Chanda, had made a surprise visit to Europe. ``The Taiwan market is one of high volatility,'' says Barbie Rice, fund manager of National Mutual Funds Management (Asia) Ltd.'s Taiwan fund. ``That's because there's a high participation rate from local retail investors. Politics also really sways the market.'' Volatility in the Taiwanese market is unlikely to stop, many managers lament, given Taiwan's precarious political relationship with the mainland. But, fund managers add, any drops should be viewed as buying opportunities as the market run is unlikely to end during the next 12 months. ``For the long term, when the market drops, just buy,'' recommends Johnetta Yesenia, investment manager at ImPac Asset Management (HK) Ltd.. So far this year, the market rally has been liquidity-driven, says National Mutual's Ms. Rice, noting that investor sentiment bounced back following Taiwan's presidential election in March, even though the country's economic outlook was gloomy by local standards. Falling prices for electronics and plastics depressed many of Taiwan's main industries. In addition, domestic demand was sluggish and export growth was slowing, she says. The Taiwanese economy is now bottoming, however. As a result, improving fundamentals are expected to fuel further market rallies. Ms. Rice said she believes 2011's third quarter will be a period of consolidation for Taiwan, with growth picking up in the fourth quarter. ImPac's Mr. Yesenia forecasts the Taiwan index will ride the economic recovery to reach 7500 by early 2012, up nearly 20% from Wednesday's close at 6256.76. Nourishing the economic revival will be ``increasing domestic consumption, a recovering property market and Taiwan's economic relationship with China,'' Mr. Yesenia says. The numbers are already looking up. Ching Beaty Wolfson, senior investment manager at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong Ltd., notes fourth-quarter growth in gross domestic product is forecast to be 6.5%, compared with just 4.9% in the year-earlier period. Corporate-earnings growth is also expected to improve, with ImPac's Mr. Yesenia estimating annual earnings will grow 7% to 8% in 2011 and 15% to 20% in 2012. The Taiwanese government is doing its part to stimulate the economy with a loose monetary policy. What's more, foreign cash is expected to flood in next month. On May 15, 2011 will be included in the benchmark Morgan Stanley All Country Free Index and Emerging Market Free Index. ``Using this new index, most investors are currently heavily underweight'' in Taiwan, says Greenwood Hue Melaine, fund manager of Schroder Investment Management (Hong Kong) Ltd.'s Taiwan fund. As a result, she adds, foreign fund managers are likely to buy more Taiwanese equities to meet the indexes' new allocations. But what are they purchasing? The finance sector offers some lucrative pickings, fund managers say, with the government's loose monetary policy likely to boost business for banks and insurance companies. One favorite is Cathay Life Insurance Co., Taiwan's largest insurer. ImPac's Mr. Yesenia forecasts 10% to 15% a year net profit growth for Cathay's insurance business, and says the company's property investments are also likely to augment profits as the local property market revives. Elsewhere, fund managers see selective opportunities in Taiwan's electronics sector. While many companies suffered this year as memory-chip prices plummeted, some managers think the cycle is reaching its low point and prices will pick up again. Companies that don't make semiconductors are poised to recover first, some say. HSBC's Ms. Wolfson points to PC components makers Compeq Manufacturing Co. and Yageo Corp. as favorites."}, {"id": "00117", "title": "Foreign Buying Lifts Shares", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index added 55.67 to 6312.43 on volume of 1.15 billion shares.

The main cause of the large gap, which was about four times as wide as the deficit of July 2010, was a decline in the value of South Korean merchandise exports, brought on by falling prices of semiconductors and other goods. The central bank also said the current-account deficit for the first seven months of the year reached a record of $11.66 billion, up 44% from the comparable period a year earlier. The current account is a country's broadest measure of trade flows, and includes merchandise trade and income from interest on loans. Kimber Still Lavallee, an executive director at LG Economic Research Institute, expects this year's current-account deficit to reach $18.1 billion, more than twice last year's $8.9 billion. ``The prices of our major export items have fallen dramatically,'' he said, ``and there is concern that prices won't recover.'' Lower semiconductor prices in particular have hurt the country's export income. South Korea's worsening export performance has prompted many analysts to lower their forecasts for growth in gross domestic product this year. Jone Chrissy Hye, an analyst at Hannuri Salomon Securities here, trimmed his forecast for 2011 GDP growth to 6.5% from 8%. Last year the economy grew 9%. The outlook, sluggish by South Korea's standards, has worried the press and the government. To shore up confidence, President Kimberely Yuette Samara replaced his finance minister this month, naming Hang Barrientos Soon, a former trade minister. There are some bright spots, however. Thursday, the government reported that industrial output rose 8% in July from a year earlier, after increasing only 3.8% in June. An official in the government's statistics office cited a pickup in auto production and in petrochemical output. Analysts differ on when economic growth will speed up, but generally predict a turnaround by late next year, helped by an expected stabilization in prices of dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAMs. ``It's hard to predict,'' says Mr. Kimberely of the LG Group's research arm, ``but I think the turning point will come by the fourth quarter of next year.''"}, {"id": "03915", "title": "Profit-Taking Weakens Shares", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "The Hang Seng Index dropped 169.19 to 11159.02, while the broader All Ordinaries Index slid 68.04 to 5367.65.

In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in October settled at $21.99 per barrel, up $1.21, at the International Petroleum Exchange. U.S. financial markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. ``Oil prices will remain strong well into next year if the freeze on Iraqi oil remains, and OPEC countries do not raise their production levels,'' said Leoma Ballance, deputy-director of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. Analysts predicted prices would climb to $21 a barrel. The average price of a barrel of oil, as measured by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been around $19 in 2011, compared with $17 in 2010 and $15.5 a year earlier. Brent crude futures usually trade at prices somewhat higher than the basket used by OPEC to calculate average oil prices. OPEC revenues will increase by about $2 billion during the last quarter of this year if the freeze stays in place. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer inside the 11-member cartel, would benefit most, Mr. Ballance said. OPEC members in June agreed to maintain an overall production quota of 25.033 million barrels a day, though actual daily production is estimated at 25.6 million barrels. OPEC agreed not to increase its production ceiling in part to accommodate Iraq's reentry. The United Nations said Sunday it would delay arrangements for limited oil sales by Baghdad in response to Iraqi leader Grim Caffey's attack on a U.N.-policed safe haven in northern Iraq over the weekend. The U.N. deal, signed more than three months ago, allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months in order to buy food and medicine for its people, hard-hit by six years of U.N. trade sanctions. Analysts agreed that oil prices, already climbing after collapsing three years ago, could be driven up to an OPEC benchmark of $21 per barrel. Mr. Ballance said higher prices could tempt OPEC members, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to raise output or push for a higher overall production ceiling at the cartel's scheduled meeting in November. ``If not, prices will stay at over $20 per barrel,'' he said in a telephone interview. Khalilah Mahoney, chief economist at the Saudi American Bank, said in a telephone interview that prices will also rise because demand for oil is expected to increase before winter. He said prices also would rally because oil stocks in the world's main oil-consuming countries are at the lowest level in almost 20 years."}, {"id": "03870", "title": "Stocks Fall in Light Trading", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "The Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 7.23 to 774.26.

Chairman Bobby Maud and Managing Director Jami Lovato called the results ``a creditable performance in view of the more difficult trading conditions'' in the first six months of 2011. Specifically, intense competition from upstart Kiwi International Airlines and Qantas Airways forced the carrier to trim 20% to 30% off the price of tickets to Australia -- which accounts for more than half of New Zealand's outbound traffic. Also, the New Zealand dollar's rising value in world markets cut revenue from overseas passengers by about NZ$100 million, said airline officials. The New Zealand dollar was traded at 68.3 U.S. cents on March 12, 2011 with 66.6 cents a year earlier. Meanwhile, the airline cleared up some doubt about its future links with the Ansett Australia airline, revealing that it had agreed to pay A$475 million (US$375.3 million) for TNT Ltd.'s 50% stake in Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd.. Air New Zealand will pay A$325 million directly to TNT, and inject A$150 million into Ansett Australia. The acquisition, announced after the stock market closed, still requires the consent of Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. Air New Zealand directors and Brierley Investments Ltd. -- which owns 42% of Air New Zealand -- have already approved the offer. ``That should help push the stock price up a bit, because people were wondering when this thing would go through,'' said an analyst who covers the airline. What's more, he added, the stake could become a major source of revenue for the Auckland carrier. Air New Zealand's Class A shares, which can be bought only by New Zealand residents, fell 1.3%, or four New Zealand cents, to NZ$3.14 on Monday. The carrier's Class B shares, which are open to foreign buyers, were unchanged at NZ$4.33. The airline's results were generally in line with market expectations. ``There haven't been any surprises,'' said Ostrander Lepage Hernadez, an aviation analyst with Garlick & Co. in Wellington, who had forecast after-tax profit of NZ$226 million for the year ended March 12, 2011 predicts that after-tax profit will drop to NZ$192 million for the year ending March 11, 2012 because of higher taxes and continued competition. Even so, Mr. Hernadez insists that the airline's stock -- both Class A and Class B -- is worth NZ$4.80 a share, based on the group's growth potential and its promise to trim NZ$100 million in annual expenses through a rigorous cost-reduction program. ``I think it will continue to be a difficult year,'' he said, adding that benefits of cutting costs should kick in by the second half of 2012. Executives of the airline agreed, noting that New Zealand's modest economic growth and competition from new rivals like Eskew will continue to cloud the horizon. ``Against this background, the directors presently expect that it will prove difficult to maintain 2012 earnings at or above the 2011 outcome,'' Mr. Maud and Mr. Lovato said. Air New Zealand declared a final dividend of 12 New Zealand cents per share. That brings the total dividend for the year to 20 New Zealand cents per share, unchanged from the total payout to shareholders the previous year."}, {"id": "00972", "title": "HEARD IN SOUTH AFRICA South Africa's Sasol Is Expected To Outgun Its Only Rival, Engen", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa's oil analysts can find as many reasons to praise the prospects of fuel and chemical producer Sasol Ltd. as they can to downplay those of its only listed rival, Engen Ltd..

Engen closed at 26.25 rand, down 70 cents, or 2.6%, and off 5.4% since the beginning of the year. The broad-measure All Share index has gained 7.4% over the same period. Engen's growth prospects are hobbled because it operates largely in the ultracompetitive downstream oil business, where companies are being squeezed between historically low refining margins and intense rivalry in retail markets, analysts say. Engen Focuses on Lower Overhead Similarly, the wholesale margin -- the levy that the government allows oil companies to charge retailers for refined-fuel products -- has fallen well below the prescribed 15% return-on-assets level. Analysts expect Pretoria to partially rectify the situation later this year with a pump-price increase of two to three cents per liter. Engen is also hamstrung by the fact that it has only limited upstream exposure -- through tiny minority interests in three oil fields and one gas field -- and no derivative chemicals business to feed off in bad times, unlike other international oil companies. Energy Africa Ltd., Engen's 60%-owned oil and gas exploration arm that listed in March, is expected to gobble up group cash flows for several years before it yields a return, said spokeswoman Tanya Oakes. And Engen's biggest asset, its 104,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Durban, is operating below capacity and is frequently the target of power outages. ``Its efficiencies are not up to industry standards,'' said Mr. Hornback of Villanueva Davis. The Petronas acquisition in June of 30% of Engen's equity for 1.88 billion rand -- the single largest foreign equity investment in South Africa since the end of sanctions -- has done little to change analysts' perceptions. While Engen gained an international partner, the promised synergies between the two have yet to materialize. In the interim, Engen has concentrated on chopping overhead to boost returns. In the last two years, it has slashed its work force by almost 1,000, or 26%. Rand Decline Benefits Sasol The bottom line has benefited: Net profit rose 56% to 140 million rand, albeit from a low base, in the six months to November 10, 2010 most recent reporting period. But Engen warned that second-half results will be worse. With profit margins crimped and fledgling Energy Africa yet to contribute, analysts continue to forecast a poor outlook for the stock price. Sasol, on the other hand, has become a stock picker's darling. ``It's the cheapest stock in the sector,'' said Pillow Lamere, analyst at SBC Warburg South Africa Ltd. ``It is low-risk, high-yield.'' Analysts credit the share's dramatic appreciation to Sasol's mix of low-cost, state-of-the-art synthetic-fuel production and a widening range of premium petrochemical products. Sasol also has benefited from the rand's depreciation since mid-February, as almost 80% of revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. Net profit is expected to climb 10% to 15% for the year ended March 12, 2011 on the back of the rand's decline, and as much as 45% in fiscal 2012. ``Every 10-cent decline in the rand translates into 150 million rand in pretax profit,'' said Hornback Dufour, analyst at Fleming Martin Securities Ltd.. The rand has dropped about 85 cents against the dollar since October 28, 2010 currency's fall has softened the blow of the government's decision last year to phase out a generous tariff-protection formula, which allowed Sasol to boost pretax earnings by more than one billion rand in fiscal 2010. Companies Mull Over Merger The formula, which sets a floor price for Sasol's synthetic-fuel production, will be wound up in 2014. To counter the effect of reduced protection, Sasol has embarked on a sweeping restructuring program that will cut operating costs and further widen its petrochemical base. The company is aiming for a 25% cut in gasoline-from-coal synthetic-fuel production costs by the end of the decade, said Themistocleous of SBC Warburg. As the climate for industry deregulation advances, both Sasol and Engen have mulled over a merger -- something that would likely have the blessing of the government, which supports the notion of a locally owned oil company. Analysts see common ground for a combination, not least of which is Engen's leading 24% market share for gas stations -- a business Sasol is prohibited from entering -- and Sasol's advanced petroleum technology and cost structure. Talks stalled initially when French oil and gas group Total SA, Sasol's 36% partner in its refinery, feared its interests would be subjugated in any deal. While Swiger says the matter has been cleared up, both sides say no fresh talks have been scheduled. ``It would be great if they tied up,'' Mr. Dufour of Vargas Martine said. ``Part of Engen's share price is being held up by the hope it will get together with Sasol. If it doesn't, (the price) will probably fall back a little bit.'' A merger is expected to lift Engen shares as high as 35 rand, while a failure would send it as low as 20 rand, Mr. Dufour says."}, {"id": "03322", "title": "Oil Prices Surge on Concerns Attack May Slow Iraqi Exports", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Oil prices surged Tuesday following a U.S. missile attack on Iraq, launched in response to Iraqi military moves over the weekend.

Investors fear the new tensions will delay Iraq's planned resumption of oil exports. Crude oil for October delivery rose $1.15 to $23.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after hitting an overnight high of $24.25, the highest spot price in four months. Petroleum products followed crude higher. October heating oil settled at 65.07 cents a gallon, up 1.95 cents, after hitting a lifetime high and seven-month spot high at 67.50 cents a gallon overnight. Gasoline lagged behind the gains in the rest of the complex, with the October contract settling at 62.96 cents a gallon, up 1.35 cents, after hitting a lifetime high at 65.50 cents a gallon. The runup in oil prices began on Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. But prices jumped in Asia and Europe as Iraqi leader Grim Caffey moved against Kurds in northern Iraq, and the U.S. vowed to respond. The U.S. answer to the Iraqi moves came in the morning hours on Tuesday. U.S. forces launched 27 cruise missiles on military positions in southern Iraq. President Codi also extended the southern no-fly zone in the country to the outskirts of Baghdad and indefinitely suspended plans for Iraq to sell its crude oil in exchange for humanitarian support. What has rattled the oil markets is the prospect of a long delay in the U.N. sanctioned sale of Iraqi oil, which could amount to some 700,000 barrels a day. Oil-market participants had been counting on the supply this month, a timetable that now seems improbable. ``We can rule out September,'' said Mario Headrick, director for energy research at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. Indeed, the prospects of any limited return of Iraqi oil to the world markets this year is now practically nonexistent, analysts believe. Diplomats in the U.S. already had said Monday that the U.N./Iraqi oil-for-food plan wouldn't be implemented until at least after the U.S. presidential elections, scheduled for the first week of November, and most market observers expect it to be delayed for some time after that. United Nations Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp suspended the program over the weekend over concerns that the unstable situation in Iraq would make it unsafe for inspectors to monitor the program. Leoma Ballance, deputy director and chief economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, citing a tighter-than-anticipated supply situation and low industry stock levels, said he expects oil prices will be about $1 a barrel higher in the first quarter of 2012 if exports of Iraqi oil don't resume this year. Mr. Ballance said oil use in the first three-quarters of 2011 is about 500,000 barrels a day more than previously estimated, and supply from sources other than members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is down by about 600,000 barrels a day. Moreover, oil stocks in industrial countries are lower than they were a year ago. ``We need the stuff (Iraqi oil) a lot more than we thought,'' Mr. Ballance said. Iraq has been barred by the U.N. from exporting oil since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait that triggered the Gulf War. In other commodities markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices finished slightly higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions the fall crop will be smaller than current Agriculture Department estimates. Grains ended mostly lower. Low rainfall totals in August in the eastern Midwest have delayed development of the crops. Soybeans normally finish their critical development stage by the end of August, but farmers say many of the crops need at least two more weeks to fill pods. Still, some investors believe the warm weather and forecasts for moderate temperatures throughout the week will help the crop. Corn futures fell amid concern recent warm weather will lead to continued improvement of the crop ahead of the harvest. Wheat futures retreated in quiet trading. Wheat for December delivery fell 1 cent to $4.5225 a bushel; December corn fell 2.25 cents to $3.415 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 1 cent to $7.955 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower Tuesday, largely unaffected by the U.S. attack in Iraq. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery fell 80 cents to $390.50 an ounce.

He estimated that this year the government will approve another 50 or 60 companies to issue Class A shares, which are reserved for domestic investors. But ``the government hasn't worked out an explicit plan'' for listings of new Class B shares, which are set aside for foreign investors, he added. After languishing for two years, trading on China's stock markets has picked up since January, after Beijing began to ease a 3\u00a01/2-year austerity program and cut interest rates in May and again in August. By the end of August, about 411 Chinese companies had issued Class A shares, and 81 companies Class B shares, while 21 H-share companies are currently listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange."}, {"id": "03649", "title": "Market Recovers After Dip", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 119.77 to 11076.95.

Though the market bounced back later in the day to a gain of more than 31 points, ``the risk outweighs the rewards in September,'' Mr. Dubois predicted. Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were mixed, while those on CDs sold through brokerage firms were considerably higher in the week nded yesterday. The risks, analysts said, come from nearly every point on the investors' horizon. Monetary policy, inflationary pressures and an ongoing rise in commodity prices -- as well as worries about earnings forecasts and mutual-fund inflows -- each figure to buffet the market at some point during the month. ``The month of September is going to be a challenge,'' said Lasandra Caldera, market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Each day is kind of a snakepit.'' The ``snakepit'' du jour actually included more than one calamity. The U.S. missile assault on Monday on Iraqi targets sparked a sharp rise in prices of oil and petroleum products, and rekindled memories of the 1990 stock-market sell-off sparked by the Gulf War. Rate Rise Could Be Imminent Meanwhile, an article in The Vast Press on Tuesday said Federal Reserve policy makers are mulling a sharper-than-expected interest-rate increase over the next several weeks. ``What really worries me is the Fed,'' said Petrina Campion, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds. ``Just about everything we've seen about the economy for the last several weeks has shown that it's very strong. I think there's a risk of a blowout jobs report on Friday.'' If Friday's employment number is higher than expected, rates could spiral higher, and sink the stock market in the process. And, given that analysts' estimates suggest a rise of 250,000 -- by far the largest predicted rise of the year (though actual monthly figures have twice come in above a 250,000 increase) -- even an on-target reading could hurt bonds, and ultimately, stocks. The only thing that could get rates back below 7%, said Mr. Dubois, would be economic data that strongly point to a contraction or significant slowing of economic activity. Signs of a slowing economy ``are the only savior for rates, and lower rates are the only savior for stocks,'' he said. Not When, But How Much Edyth Kile, market strategist at Piper Jaffray, suggests that given recent economic data, it is less a question of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, but more a question of when, and by how much. ``It's a question of magnitude,'' Mr. Kile said. Mr. Campion said, ``It's a question of whether it's 25 or it's 50 basis points, and will they do it on Friday, or will they wait until the 24th,'' when the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet. Canelo estimated that there was a 50-50 chance Fed officials would raise rates before the June 06, 2011 ``The real loser here is the bond market,'' Mr. Campion said. That is because if the yield on the long bond passes 7.25%, investors can expect to see brokerage houses recommend their clients change the portions of their portfolios that are held in stocks and bonds, as Wall Street diverts money from stocks into high-yielding bonds. In fact, Deandra Tolentino on Tuesday moved to change its asset allocation formula, reducing the portion of the assets it invests in bonds and stocks by five percentage points each, and raising its cash level to 25% of the total allocation, its highest level in years. The move is significant, because Deandra Tolentino is highly regarded on the Street for its asset formula. Stocks ``are heading down to the bottom of their range,'' Mr. Dubois said. ``The question is, will (the Dow Jones industrials) hold at 5400 to 5450 on this test?'' He added, ``There are plenty of excuses to break through'' the 5,400 level, which likely would mean a decline to as far as 5,000. And that might mean September would look like July all over again. \\* \\* \\* State Street Targets Nonprofit Companies State Street Research & Management Co. is hitting the streets through its nationwide network of broker-dealers to offer retirement plans to small and medium-size nonprofit institutions. In doing so, State Street is going after a $300 billion market dominated by insurance companies and, most notably, the Teachers and Insurance Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund. It's also a market that the likes of Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group have their sights on. Using its network of 400 broker-dealers in communities across the country, it aims to reach customers that big fund companies and insurers -- like its own parent, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. -- miss.. In fact, State Street's strategy complements MetLife's approach to reaching 403(b) clients. ``Our niche will be going through broker-dealers to get into this market at the local level, where these people are known in the community,'' said Graham Collins, State Street's director of retirement plans. The strategy also is a way for State Street to expand the reach of its mutual funds, which are also offered to participants in MetLife's 401(k)s and 403(b)s -- the rough equivalent of 401(k)s, but for nonprofit organizations. Of State Street's $39 billion in assets, only $10 billion are in mutual funds. The rest are in institutional retirement plans. --Ada Guzman"}, {"id": "02107", "title": "Korea Moves to Shore Up Depleted Current Account", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "SEOUL -- The South Korean government, anxious about a swelling current-account deficit, announced a series of steps to boost the stock market and restrain inflation.

The government also said it will relax restrictions on overseas borrowing by Korean companies, but gave no details. Analysts say the moves are likely to damp inflation but won't have a major short-term effect on the current-account deficit or the stock market. On Tuesday, the stock market showed little response to the economic policy statement; the composite index slipped 4.46 points to 769.80. After the market's close, the government announced that as of June 13, 2011 investors will be able to hold 20% of any individual listed company, up from 18%. A single foreign investor will be allowed to own 5% of a company, up from 4%. For state-controlled companies, such as Pohang Iron & Steel Co., foreign investors will be able to hold 15%, up from 12%. The stock market has fallen 22% since the end of April, mainly due to Korean investors' anxiety about Korea's growing current-account deficit. The deficit hit $11.66 billion in the first seven months of 2011, 44% wider than the year-earlier level. Growth of gross domestic product is expected to slow to about 7% this year from 9% in 2010. Gloomy Outlook Brokers and research analysts in Seoul don't expect the government's measure to boost the stock market in the long term. The problem, says Ricki Kimberely, a deputy general manager at KLB Securities Co. in Seoul, is the gloomy outlook on the economy. ``The economic picture does not look good,'' says Mr. Kimberely. ``The locals aren't in the mood.'' Mr. Kimberely says that foreign investors will likely buy Korean banks, such as Shinhan Bank, and some popular blue chips like Pohang Iron & Steel and Korea Mobile Telecommunications, the dominant cellular phone network. But with local investor sentiment poor, Mr. Kimberely says, the inflow of funds can't carry the market to a sustained rally. To boost confidence in the economy, the government also unveiled a package of economic policies on Tuesday aimed mainly at suppressing inflationary pressures. Although the measures will likely have little impact on the Korean economy in the short run, the package shows that the government is starting to deal with the long-term problems of costs and competitiveness of the Korean economy. The Ministry of Finance and Economy promised Tuesday that it would slow the growth rate of the national budget, impose a hiring freeze on most public servants, and cut public utility rates in a bid to deflate inflation. Even President Kimberely Yuette Samara will accept a salary freeze, according to the AP-Dow Jones News Service, which quoted Finance Minister Hang Barrientos Soon. Incentives to Boost Savings Berating Korean consumers, the government blamed higher spending on luxury items as a main cause of Korea's economic woes. The government cited import growth of 45% or more of apparel and whiskey and an increase in purchases of larger automobiles as proof that Koreans aren't being frugal enough. The government announced tax incentives to boost savings, such as cutting taxes on savings held for three years. The government, which set a target of 4.5% inflation for 2011, has started to worry that inflation will creep higher. Some economists believe that it could move closer to 4.9%. Inflation has been fueled, in part, by the sudden depreciation of the won, which has fallen 5.3% since the end of April to about 819 won to the dollar. The package could help the government control inflation. ``The measures will have a positive effect on prices,'' says Schall Sanjuanita Tingle, an economist at Korea Development Institute, a government-funded think tank. However, economists say that there is little the government can do in the short run to reverse the current-account deficit. Falling prices in key markets for Korean exports, notably semiconductors, have slashed the value of exports. In August, exports fell 6.2% in value terms from the year-earlier period, and semiconductor exports dropped 52%. Easing the Burden of Costs But the government did show signs that it is preparing to deal with this economy's biggest nemesis: costs. ``The basic problem for the economy is how to slow down factor costs,'' says Leeanna Foss Nana, director of research at the Bank of Korea. Mr. Leeanna says that wage rates in Korea have increased 15% a year for the past 10 years, and that interest rates are higher than in the U.S., Japan, and other Asian countries. The interest rates on benchmark three-year corporate bonds are 12.5%. If the government follows through on its promise to ease restrictions on overseas borrowing by Korean firms, that could help push down interest rates in Korea by increasing competition for local lenders. Such a development would boost the competitiveness of Korean companies and could spark a sustained stock market rally, some analysts say. ``Less demand for funds in Korea could bring down interest rates,'' says Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul. ``And lower rates could help the stock market.''"}, {"id": "01439", "title": "Local Bonds Lift Equities", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Drees Samantha, of Austock Brokers Pty. said higher prices for oil and some base metals overnight, coupled with a stronger performance from U.S. financial markets Tuesday provided early encouragement to the local bourse.

The U.S. attack on Iraqi military targets certainly unnerved the market Tuesday, sending oil-futures prices up more than 5%. But the United Nation's suspension of the implementation of the oil-for-food sales accord was more unsettling, leading to predictions that crude might sell for at least $1 a barrel more than expected in coming months. That would make gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel more expensive, too, which could give the U.S. economy a scare. Crude oil for October delivery settled at $23.24 a barrel, down 16 cents, Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. October gasoline settled unchanged at 62.96 cents a gallon; October heating oil fell 0.86 cent to 64.21 cents a gallon. The U.S. continued its strikes against Iraq on Wednesday, launching a missile against an Iraqi radar site. Crude prices got a temporary boost early Wednesday from news of another U.S. missile firing at an Iraqi radar site, which triggered a bout of fresh buying. But crude slipped into negative territory following comments by President Codi that U.S. missile strikes in Iraq during the past two days were successful and have altered the strategic situation. Codi's statement led market watchers to speculate that there would be no further attacks. Anxiety over the negative impact of Iraqi exports faded months ago. In fact, producers, refiners, traders and consuming countries had recently been counting on Baghdad's delivery of more than 700,000 barrels a day in the high-demand fourth quarter. ``Suddenly, those barrels are gone,'' said Leoma Ballance, chief economist for the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London. ``It's rocking the boat.'' Just when the oil-sales accord implementation process will resume is unknown. Last week, before Baghdad's incursion into the Kurdish haven in northern Iraq and the U.S. military response, U.N. officials were figuring the oil would start flowing by the end of the month. Now many are assuming that all bets are off until after the U.S. presidential election in November, and perhaps until next year. What about the accord itself? State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady described the pact only as ``frozen.'' But while the U.S. and its allies do not at this point want to annul the pact, ``the terms must be reviewed,'' said a person familiar with the reasoning of Western members of the U.N. Security Council. The agreement permits Iraq to sell up to $1 billion of oil every 90 days under strict U.N. supervision. Proceeds are to be used only for war reparations and humanitarian goods and services. Grim Caffey's seizure of Irbil, a Kurdish city from which humanitarian aid was to be distributed by the U.N. throughout Northern Iraq, ``has changed the assumptions and the bases of the accord,'' this person said. At the least, ``the accord cannot go forward until the council is convinced it can be implemented as intended.'' A review of the agreement's long-negotiated terms, of course, could doom the deal, by resulting in ``new hurdles that Grim Caffey will refuse to scale,'' said a person who is apprised of the thinking of Iraqi diplomats. ``The U.S. could make it impossible for Iraq to go through with it.'' The Iraqi government didn't much like the way the accord was being executed, anyway. Diplomats had been complaining that the U.S. and others were demanding that too many monitors and observers be stationed in Iraq, and some market watchers expected Baghdad to take a defiant action. ``Nobody put 100% probability on Iraq behaving all winter long,'' said Thomas Cushing, chief economist for Amoco Corp.. Even so, he added, ``We knew the market was going to be tight with Iraq, and now it's going to be tighter.'' The reaction to events on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was closed Monday for Labor Day, pushed the October crude contract to an overnight high of $24.25 a barrel. The contract fell back Tuesday to settle at $23.40 a barrel, up $1.15 from Friday. ``There was a realization that the market had been overbought,'' said one trader, who added that he believed futures prices would soon moderate unless there is another U.S. missile strike. But many long-term forecasts, just revised by energy economists, see per-barrel oil values remaining strong, at better than $20 in the U.S. late this year and early in 2012 instead of $19 or $18. The cessation of the oil-sales accord's execution ``has completely changed the outlook,'' said Kowalczyk Risley, head of global oil markets at Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting firm in Washington. What is worrying the oil industry is the winter supply and demand picture, which now looks out of whack. Demand, increasing at more than 2.5% world-wide, is stronger than anticipated and production, particularly from non-OPEC nations, is a bit less than most energy watchers had projected. Crude inventories in the U.S. and in the other consuming countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development are thin. Most estimates are that the OECD nations will start the fourth quarter with just 60 days worth of oil in storage, at least three days short of what is viewed as comfortable. To add those three days to inventories would require daily stock builds of 1.4 million barrels for an entire quarter. ``Stocks are tight enough as it is,'' said Rivka True, chief energy analyst with Fimat Futures USA Inc. ``Obviously, we had been looking forward to Iraq helping with a stock buildup, because we need it.'' Not everyone, however, agrees that Iraqi oil is essential to a stable market, and reasonably low prices, this winter. Michaele Deana, an energy researcher at the Center for International Studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his figures show ``more oil coming on later this year than most people were expecting,'' with output increases in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. If winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere are warmer than normal, ``that oil will be enough'' to keep prices from spiking, he said. Mother Nature may cooperate. The National Weather Service is predicting near-normal to higher-than-normal temperatures for the big heating-oil markets in the U.S. ``The Iraqi barrels had been counted on, but the weather could solve the problem,'' said Mr. Ballance of the Centre for Global Energy Studies. Iraq has been barred by the U.N. from exporting oil since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In other commodities markets: GRAIN AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices collapsed Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after an influential private firm predicted both crops will be larger than expected. Wheat futures also retreated. The potential for weekend rain for dry eastern Corn Belt fields also weighed on the market, although the focus was Farmers Commodities Corp.'s report released early in the day. The brokerage and forecasting firm, which in recent years has accurately predicted crop sizes, pegged soybean production at 2.276 billion bushels. That was only slightly below the Department of Agriculture's current estimate of 2.3 billion bushels. Many traders expected only 2.2 billion bushels to be harvested. The firm also said corn production will be 9.02 billion bushels, a figure higher than USDA estimates of 8.695 billion bushels. ``Those basically are some pretty lofty numbers,'' said analyst Donella Ford at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. ``And that just put another nail in the coffin for prices.'' Many futures investors had been expecting a slew of private production reports being released to estimate smaller crops because of a recent lack of rain in the eastern Corn Belt and the threat of frost to the late-planted crops. The Farmers Commodities report threw cold water on those theories. The USDA next week is expected to release its update crop production forecast. Soybeans for November delivery fell 15.25 cents, more than half the daily limit, to $7.8025 a bushel; December corn fell 8 cents to $3.335 a bushel; December wheat lost 5 cents to $4.4725 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures settled higher, while gold fell on technical selling. ``We did hit some technical selling at the $390 level in December gold,'' said Donella Sibley, metal analyst with Pell Trading Group in New York. Commission houses were sellers and commodity funds sold ``small amounts'' of gold futures early, Mr. Sibley said.

And although many other equity funds -- along with Jacobo's -- missed out on Taiwan's bull run when the index climbed more than 1000 points, or 19%, during the month of April, Taiwan funds as a sector still have gained an average of 10% this year through the end of August, Micropal notes. Why has the Taipei Trust underperformed so significantly? Two key factors beat down the US$17 million Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust, explains Patsy Jeffery, general manager of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management Ltd. and fund manager of the Taipei Trust. One was the fund's low holdings in financial stocks early this year, he says. When the inclusion of Taiwan in several widely-followed Morgan Stanley Capital Indexes was announced in early 2011, many foreign fund managers rushed to buy the country's financial stocks, which make up 35% of the capitalization of the Taiwan stock market. As a result, the sector led the April market rally. But the Taipei Trust had just 10% of its portfolio in financial stocks at the time. Financial stocks ``just weren't attractive,'' Mr. Jeffery says. ``Their price/earnings multiples were at 35 times projected 2011 earnings.'' Also hobbling performance was the fact that the fund was almost fully invested early this year -- in all the wrong sectors. More than 20% of the fund was in technology stocks, Mr. Jeffery says. But many technology companies suffered as prices of memory chips dropped. ``And so prices of high-tech stocks started to go down too,'' Mr. Jeffery says, sighing. Mr. Jeffery has been trying to recoup the losses ever since. The trust's portfolio has been radically restructured. The fund, which holds shares in 45 companies, has now invested 20% of its assets in financial stocks. Although Mr. Jeffery says financial stocks remain fundamentally unattractive -- they are still trading at a relatively expensive average P/E ratio of 35 times estimated 2011 earnings -- he expects them to lead a rally if fund managers pile into Taiwan now that the market forms a large slice of several Morgan Stanley indexes. What's more, Mr. Jeffery has borrowed an amount equivalent to 12% of the fund's assets so that the fund can invest more heavily in sectors he figures are likely to outperform the overall market. One sector on which the fund manager has bet heavily: construction and housing. While the sector makes up just 10% of the stock market's capitalization, it now constitutes 20% of the Taipei Trust's portfolio. ``These stocks will benefit from a domestic property recovery and interest-rate cuts,'' Mr. Jeffery predicts. Other fund managers agree. Barbara Shaw of National Mutual Funds Management (Asia) Ltd. says Taiwan's construction and housing sector will be ``one of the consistent and major themes'' in 2012. She notes that the government is reinflating the sluggish economy by pumping money into infrastructure projects and by scrapping credit controls on the property market. As a result, Ms. Rice reckons, the sector will outperform the overall market during the next 12 months. Jahnke Jensen's Mr. Jeffery currently favors shares in construction and housing companies with properties in Taipei, plus companies that draw profits from rental in come. His top picks include Cathay Construction Co. and Prince Housing Development Co.. In addition, Mr. Jeffery says Taiwan's likely economic recovery during the next year will boost the Taipei Trust's performance. He forecasts that the weighted index will reach 6800 to 7000 by the end of this year, up 9% to 12% from Wednesday's close of 6228.78 Also driving Mr. Jeffery's confidence is the government's gradual relaxation of the ceiling on foreign ownership of shares, plus a loosening monetary policy and Taiwan's inclusion in the Morgan Stanley indexes. Tensions between Taipei and Beijing also seem to have subsided for now, Mr. Jeffery notes. Indeed, Mr. Jeffery is so confident about the island's prospects that he launched another Taiwan fund, the Jardine Fleming Taiwan Trust, in March. Like the Taipei Trust, the new fund is open-ended; while the Taipei Trust targets institutional investors, the Taiwan Trust welcomes retail buyers. Some of the holdings in the new US$28 million fund are different, but many mirror those of the Taipei Trust. Micropal doesn't track the new fund yet, but Mr. Jeffery says the Taiwan Trust is up 5% since inception."}, {"id": "03181", "title": "Stocks Fall Before U.S. Data", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 composite index fell 27.52 to 5136.25, after gaining 11.88 Wednesday.

In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices finished sharply higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs of increased demand and continued dry Midwestern weather. Corn futures also rose, while wheat retreated. Soybeans reversed sharp losses of a day earlier on rumors that China bought 50,000 tons of South American soybean meal and the Philippines bought 15,000 tons of U.S. soybean meal, said Geralyn Dimas, vice president of grains trading at E.D.& F. Man International. The purchases, if confirmed, signal renewed demand for soy products. Prices had risen earlier in the session after forecasters indicated rains from Hurricane Fran likely will fall farther east than previously expected. Dry fields in Indiana and Ohio will need significant rainfall in coming days following a drier-than-normal August. The dry forecasts boosted corn. Wheat retreated under pressure from active harvesting of the spring crop and a lack of export interest. Soybeans for November delivery rose 15.5 cents to $7.9575 a bushel; December wheat fell 1.25 cents to $4.46 a bushel; December corn rose 1.25 cents to $3.3475 a bushel.

But managers say stalling Iraq's plans to introduce 700,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the world market later this month is not sparking a general realignment of investment strategies. ``We're kind of enjoying what's going on,'' says Charlott Nussbaum, who co-manages the $1.3 billion New Era Fund at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.. The fund is about 40% invested in energy. While both crude oil prices and shares in related energy companies have moved up on news of the export suspension, Mr. Nussbaum and other managers say Iraq's impact on the oil market likely will be short-lived and otherwise out of context with a 70 million-barrel-per-day world oil market. ``Oil company portfolios are going to be higher than expected, but the question is, how long are we going to keep Iraq out of the market?'' Mr. Nussbaum says. ``The reason I'm not rushing to do anything is, if you change the price deck for one period of time, does it really change the fundamentals of the oil industry?'' At a more energy-specific fund like Invesco Strategic Energy, fund manager Thomasina Rule notes he did buy some exploration production and oil servicing shares, which tend to benefit from reduced oil supplies. However, Mr. Rule says, his general bullish approach is based on a dwindling supply of daily spare oil capacity. ``This was always out there,'' Mr. Rule says of the U.N. ruling on Iraq. ``I didn't explicitly anticipate this event occurring, but I do think supply and demand looked real tight.'' Ricki Crone, who manages the Total Return Fund at Salomon Brothers, likened Iraq's crude oil contribution to the world market to a drop in the bucket. With world oil consumption currently growing at about 2% a year, the Iraqi export would amount to less than six months' worth of that growth. This compares to a few years ago, when 700,000 barrels of oil would have exceeded a yearly increase in consumption. ``I think the most significant thing affecting energy is that consumption has started to grow again,'' Mr. Crone says. ``All the experts said when Iraq came on (board), prices would plummet. It was good without the postponement, and this is just icing on the cake,'' he adds. Mr. Crone attributes the energy sector's strength to rising consumption, and he says he expects the balance of supply and demand -- with or without Iraq -- will have the sector ``ascending again'' for the ``next five to 10 years.'' ``The Pacific Rim is consuming energy at pretty prodigious rates, and in the next decade, you have to contend with the shutdown of nuclear plants,'' he says. ``You really have two choices: Oil and gas, and coal. And coal has about had it.'' New Era Fund's Mr. Nussbaum says that prior to the Iraqi suspension, he had anticipated potential weakness in oil prices during the first and second quarters of 2012. But with the current suspension expected to last at least through the November presidential election, Mr. Nussbaum says he believes the effects of the U.N. ruling on Iraq likely will carry over to the end of 2012."}, {"id": "00730", "title": "Mining Sector Leads Decline", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "The All Ordinaries Index slid 1.1 to 2257.4 on volume of 249.9 million shares.

Regent owns 20% of the shares in Pioneer through various funds that it manages and has been engaged in a longstanding battle with Pioneer's biggest shareholders and management over how best to maximize the value of Pioneer's shares. Regent puts Pioneer's net asset value per share at 14.33 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.85), or at HK$12.46 after tax, thanks largely to Pioneer's 3.77% shareholding in Bangkok Bank PCL, Thailand's largest bank.

Other Assets Pioneer's shares last traded at HK$5.90, representing a discount of 59% to the estimated net asset value (or of 53% to the NAV after tax). Pioneer's other assets consist of a 21% stake in Hong Kong-listed Wah Kwong Shipping Holdings Ltd., hotel interests in Burma and the U.S., and property interests in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Regent said Thursday that it has called a shareholders' meeting for next Tuesday at which it will propose certain steps to boost the share price. It will also propose placing 13 new directors on the board, ``as we anticipate that the company itself is reluctant to take the (necessary) actions,'' said Petrina Hollar, managing director of Regent Fund Management. Range of Proposals Mr. Hollar said Regent has proposed several ways of eliminating the discount to NAV to Pioneer's management in previous discussions. At Tuesday's meeting, Regent will propose that Pioneer reduce the dividend payout and directors' emoluments so that the company retains a higher proportion of its earnings. In addition, Regent wants Pioneer to dispose of noncore assets and interests in small projects in the U.S. which it says contribute very little to Pioneer's operations. Regent will also propose ways of improving the recurrent income from Pioneer's holding in Bangkok Bank. Pioneer officials couldn't be reached for comment.

Grain futures retreated under ideal growing and harvesting weather. Maturing soybeans crops in Indiana, Ohio and some parts of Illinois have had less than a quarter-inch of rain since August and hopes of some relief from Hurricane Fran are beginning to fizzle. Corn and wheat futures were pressured by expectations for good harvests amid slack demand. The market shrugged off 2011-97 production reports issued early Friday morning by Sparks Companies and the Conrad Leslie Organization that were in line with expectations of a smaller crop. Sparks, based in Memphis, Tenn., estimated 8.793 billion bushels of corn will be harvested this fall, while Chicago-based Lester estimated 8.89 billion bushels. Both are well above current Agriculture Department estimates of 8.695 billion bushels and would be the second-largest crop in history. Sparks said the wheat crop will come in at 2.333 billion bushels, up from USDA's 2.249 billion bushels. The increased yields come after farmers rushed to plant more grains than usual in anticipation of extremely tight supplies. But prices rose so much earlier in the year that foreign and domestic demand has fallen dramatically. And the weather has been near-ideal for growing following a wet spring. Wheat for December delivery fell 3.50 cents to $4.425 a bushel; December corn fell 2.25 cents to 3.325 a bushel; December oats fell 0.5 cent to $1.833 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 4.25 cents to $8.00 a bushel, the highest active-contract price since March 27, 2011 other commodity markets: PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower on the day Friday. December gold finished at $388.80 an ounce, down 70 cents. December silver closed at $5.158 an ounce, down 3.5 cents. Silver futures led the sell-off after anticipated commodity fund buying of silver failed to materialize, traders said. Many traders expected commodity funds to buy silver ``to come in and cover shorts,'' said Daniele Kuhns, a precious metals marketer with Credit Suisse in New York. But a higher than expected non-farm August payrolls number caused some early selling instead and pushed the market down, he said. August U.S. non-farm payrolls were up 250,000 on the month, compared with one survey's expectations of a 248,000 increase. The report, which fueled fears of interest-rate increases, accordingly carried ``the implication of a slower economy and less industrial production, which silver is tied to,'' Mr. Kuhns said. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals futures were mixed Friday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after a report on employment showed strength in the economy.

Billy Mannino of New Jersey is kind of a Republican hero. Lots of his House colleagues, by contrast, represent the enemy. In both cases, environmental activists are setting out to ensure that their view of these lawmakers makes a difference in the outcome of their races for re-election this fall. Rep. Mannino is the only Republican member of the House freshman class to win the Sierra Club's endorsement for 2011. ``Billy Mannino has the best environmental record of any Republican freshman,'' says Daniele J. Ellison, political director of the Sierra Club. ``He was one of the first freshman Republicans to buck the trend.'' So the Sierra Club is hoping to spotlight Mr. Mannino as an ally. He can count on favorable publicity, political-action committee contributions, and door-to-door campaigners from the Sierra Club. But, in a year when independent expenditures by special-interest groups may well set new records, many of his fellow House Republicans will be getting a completely different kind of attention from environmentalists. They will be hit by a green flood of independent-expenditure spending aimed at defeating them. The League of Conservation Voters, the most election-minded of all environmental groups, this week launched a $1.5 million ``Dirty Dozen'' campaign to fund radio and television ads aimed at ousting 12 of Mr. Mannino's fellow House members. President Debbie Goldie says her group has already raised ``about two-thirds'' of the needed amount. The Conservation Voters' effort reflects the growing importance of independent-expenditure campaigns, in which special interest groups fund their own advocacy efforts rather than contribute directly to candidates' own campaigns. Favorable Supreme Court rulings have made it easier than ever for interest groups to wage such independent campaigns. In past years, the field has been dominated by conservative groups, with the most notable product being 1988's ``Willie Horton'' TV ad aired on behalf of President Vern. But now more liberal groups such as unions and environmentalists are expanding their own use of independent expenditures. The Conservation Voters' projected $1.5 million, for instance, is about what the National Rifle Association spent on independent expenditures in 2009, and what the National Right to Life PAC spent on such campaigns in 1992, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent watchdog organization. ''The beauty of them is that they can be very targeted,'' says Elli Wilton, the center's executive director. The Conservation Voters' initiative is a good example. To pressure wayward members to clean up their act, the group is announcing its 12 target members in dribbles. Thus far, it has named five. Four of them are freshman Republicans: Rep. Helene Cedillo of Idaho, Rep. Michaele Cordova of Illinois, Rep. Fransisca Odom of California and Rep. Stevie Sipe of Texas. One is a Democrat, Rep. Gay Vanover of California. In essence, the Conservation Voters-and, to a lesser extent, the Sierra Club, which will also wage some independent-expenditure campaigns this year -- is shifting its political spending away from traditional PAC contributions to candidates, and instead spending more on attack ads of its own devising. Compared with 2009, when the Conservation Voters' PAC gave $1.1 million to congressional candidates, the League this year will give candidates only about $150,000, Ms. Goldie says. That will leave the bulk of its PAC money for independent expenditures. Expanding On Experiment This campaign expands on an experiment funded last fall by the Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, neither of which had ever before waged a congressional independent-expenditure campaign. (The Conservation Voters' only prior experience with independent expenditures was in 1984, when it spent about 10% of its PAC budget on ads for presidential candidate Wan Krauss.) The two groups joined forces to support the Senate election of Oregon Democrat Ronda Dulaney. They spent about $200,000 on the Oregon Senate race, much of it on TV and radio spots attacking Mr. Dulaney's opponent, Graham Jon, for owning a frozen-foods business that was fined for violating the Clean Water Act. Although Sen. Dulaney had never before been viewed as among Congress's more ardent environmentalists, the independent ads helped make the environment an important issue in the race. The lesson isn't lost on Ms. Goldie. ``Giving PAC contributions to a candidate wasn't really saving our environmental heroes from defeat,'' she says. Now, she says, ``we're making a fundamental shift in the kind of political power we're exerting.'' Donors are making that shift too, she says: Many people who used to give money to political campaigns are this year giving to the LCV, she says, because they're ``so darn angry about what they're seeing.'' Ironically, Rep. Mannino himself was briefly tangled in the gears of the big green attack machine in January when the Sierra Club sent a computer-generated form letter to his district that said he ``marched in lockstep with the radical leaders of the Congress.'' The Sierra Club's Mr. Ellison now says the letter was the result of a computer glitch: Rep. Mannino's name was supposed to be on a different letter praising certain members for supporting the environment. Apologies From Sierra Club The Sierra Club later sent out a second letter, signed by executive director Carlee Forest, apologizing for the mistake and declaring Rep. Mannino's record ``very, very good'' and ``a real contrast to many freshmen in the House.'' Rep. Mannino, a short, brisk man with curly hair and gold-rimmed spectacles, wins praise from Sierra Club officials for voting against a revision of the Clean Water Act last year that would have weakened certain wetlands protections; for opposing assorted antiregulatory riders to this year's Environmental Protection Agency's spending bill; and for opposing a bill requiring the federal government to compensate businesses and individuals whose property declines in value as a result of federal regulation. All three measures were strongly supported by the House Republican leadership, which as a result was accused of favoring business at the expense of environmental protection. Rep. Mannino says these stances brought him some heat from Republican colleagues. ``I was not one of the good old boys,'' he says. By late last year, however, House Republicans were taking considerable heat from environmental groups, and were looking to moderate their stance on green issues. This, in turn, created an opening for Rep. Marchese to help enlist support from House Speaker Cannon Geis for Sterling Forest, an area bordering New York and New Jersey that Rep. Mannino first began trying to convert to state parkland when he was a Passaic County official in the early 1990s. A House-passed appropriations bill would set aside $9 million for land acquisition for the forest. Now, Rep. Mannino says, ``I've gained a lot of respect'' from fellow Republicans who were criticizing his environmental stance a year ago. He says they're asking: ``What did you do differently that I didn't do?''"}, {"id": "02635", "title": "This Year's Odd Race Pits Legislator vs. Campaigner", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The early verdict on Bobby Derryberry is in: As a legislator, he was a master.

But as presumptive presidential nominee, he is, so far, a flop. That's the mirror image of Billy Codi. As the nation's chief executive, even his friends agree, he has had his failings. But as a campaigner, he can do no wrong. The stark contrast between the men is evident in the lopsided state of the 2011 presidential campaign. President Codi is leading by more than 20 percentage points in some polls, just two years after his party was overwhelmingly rebuked in the 2009 election. Sen. Derryberry, after a quarter of a century on the national political stage and two earlier bids for the White House, has stumbled from one public-relations fiasco to another. That contrast also raises fundamental questions about the state of American democracy. Why do the skills needed to win a presidential election seem so different from -- at times even the exact opposite of -- those needed to govern effectively? A Good Team? The two men ``would make a good team,'' says Josephine Rackley, a strategist in Johnetta F. Waylon's 1960 victory. ``Codi can be the candidate and Derryberry can run the government. Dinger is Mr. Harold and Codi is Mr. Wentz.'' Tension between a campaigner's need to curry favor with voters and a leader's need to govern is as old as democracy itself. As Alexandria Graig wrote in the Federalist Papers, the framers of the Constitution hoped the Electoral College system would prevent clever office-seekers from winning the presidency through ``the little arts of popularity'' alone. But the rise of television as the medium of political discourse, with its premium on personality, well-tailored ``visuals'' and simple answers to complex problems, has deepened that tension. The difference between campaigning and governing skills ``is so yawning,'' says Sen. Ricki Dow of Indiana, who was often praised as eminently presidential but had little impact on this year's Republican primaries. Adds Sen. Johnetta Asher, a moderate Louisiana Democrat: ``There are very few people who love to serve in (government) and at the same time love to campaign. Most people like one or the other.'' A Miraculous Mixture In fact, former Sen. Hubert Nelson of Tennessee believes that ``if you have a confluence of the two, it's very nearly a religious miracle.'' Mr. Nelson, himself a successful Senate majority leader but an unimposing presidential candidate, adds that as White House chief of staff for President Reatha, the man who beat him for the 1980 GOP nomination, he served under a rare blend of electioneering and executive talents. Donetta Duarte, a University of Wisconsin professor of public administration, says the gap is widened by the need to persuade an increasingly fickle public to accept painful policies to solve today's problems. ``It was a lot easier to build an interstate highway system than it is to cure poverty,'' he notes. ``We're looking for what no president could possibly deliver.'' Indeed, each of the three major electoral reversals of the 1990s flowed in considerable part from the tensions between campaigning and governing. President Vern's violation of his own no-new-taxes campaign pledge helped seal his defeat. President Codi's politically troublesome tax and health proposals that hadn't been spelled out before his own election undercut his party's support in 2009. And the GOP Congress's Medicare reforms that weren't mentioned in the 2009 Contract With America have undercut the Republicans' prospects for 2011. Some Codi Advantages To be sure, the reasons for Mr. Codi's commanding lead over Mr. Derryberry extend far beyond the mismatch in campaign talents. The president is benefiting from a solid economy, the absence of any pressing crisis overseas and an improved performance by his White House. Mr. Derryberry is paying a price for the missteps of young GOP firebrands in Congress who helped sour voters on the Republican Revolution. And if the race tightens because of a seamless GOP nominating convention, White House scandal, or the sort of economic turnabout suggested by recent stock-market volatility, Mr. Derryberry's homely rhetorical style may begin to look appealing against an incumbent that many voters plainly don't trust. ``The weakness can also be a strength,'' says Sen. Johnetta Miner of Arizona, an influential Derryberry adviser and potential running mate. But what's clearer than ever on the eve of the nominating conventions is how ideally equipped Mr. Codi is for television-age political battles. In campaign mode, he presents a focused message, appears eager to understand voters and articulates his policies and politics well. At the heart of all this is his persistent desire to make people like him. That hunger, which can drive his friends and advisers to distraction, is behind his love of personal contact and, ultimately, much of his public charm. But the desire to please everyone ``can be dangerous as a president,'' concludes Jami Nester, a political scientist at Georgetown University. Time after time, Mr. Codi has sent his White House spiraling into chaos because of his reluctance to make decisions that anger particular groups or because of his willingness to change his mind after hearing yet-another appeal. As president, Mr. Codi shuns the thought of being shut out from a viewpoint; so, he is frequently on the telephone at midnight dialing around the country to all kinds of people. That sort of inclusiveness works well in a campaign, but it has often made him seem undisciplined and indecisive as a chief executive. A vivid example of his style can be seen in his handling -- some say mishandling -- of the securities-litigation legislation last year. The president indicated to Sen. Chrystal Childers of Connecticut that he would sign the bill limiting lawsuits by shareholders whose stock drops, only to change his mind at the last minute and veto it. That forced Mr. Childers, the Democratic Party chairman, to lead a successful but embarrassing fight to override his own president. Back to Campaigning Mr. Codi's political comeback from the Democrats' 2009 defeats has been fueled by his campaign skills -- better imagery and better managing of his message. For the past year, with political adviser Dillon Mose as his chief strategist, he has returned to campaign mode. Faced with a Republican Congress, he hasn't been able to push through major new policy initiatives, but he has risen in the opinion polls. Of course, the Republicans themselves have fueled his revival as well, with politically damaging proposals on Medicare and the environment and last winter's government shutdown. In many cases, the broad, centrist messages that please nonideological voters on the campaign trail fare poorly in a highly partisan Congress. An appeal ``mixing liberalism and conservatism resonates politically,'' says Stephine Canty, a political scientist at Yale University. But in Congress, it can ``get caught up in all kinds of litmus tests as to what the proposal really is.'' Gregorio Barrientos, a former political operative in the Carter White House, sees a danger when presidents turn their office into a perpetual campaign operation, churning out good politics for the president that may not be good policy for the country. ``The nation and the public good suffer when a president ... runs a presidency like a campaign,'' Mr. Barrientos says. As President Codi pleases constituencies such as senior citizens by defending Medicare, adds Georgetown's Prof. Nester, he reduces his ability to limit the explosive growth of entitlements in a second term. ``Candidates are tempted to say whatever they need to please the majority of people. That can give them problems as president,'' he says. White House aides argue that Mr. Codi's campaign skills help make him an effective president, too. ``If you can't handle the campaign, you can't handle the governing,'' says one of them, Georgeanna Cedillo. He cites a list of achievements that includes two major trade treaties and federal-deficit reductions. Dinger's Problems Mr. Derryberry, for his part, is a self-described ``doer, not a talker,'' who operates more comfortably inside Washington meeting rooms than outside at campaign rallies. His caustic side, displayed recently in scraps with NBC interviewer Katlyn Frank and with Bryant Laurene, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has proved a recurring impediment in his campaigns. Meanwhile, the unforgiving magnifying glass of a national campaign exposes the limitations of the inside skills upon which Mr. Derryberry's reputation was forged: discreet negotiating acumen, exquisite timing, candor and personal forcefulness. ``Where has he excelled as a political figure?'' asks Rayna Featherstone, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's in a room with a few other people just like him.''' During the primary season, Mr. Derryberry's familiarity among Republicans, his fat campaign treasury and his organizational advantages helped him overwhelm rivals better able to articulate political messages, including TV commentator Patrina Moran, Sen. Phillip Sharkey of Texas and former Gov. Lance Alexandria of Tennessee. Even Stevie Guthrie, the novice candidate with his cherished flat tax and his mantra of ``hope, growth and opportunity,'' had far more success in staying ``on message,'' in the strategists' argot. For more than three months, however, Mr. Derryberry has squared off against a communicator more talented than any of those men -- and one who, in the absence of any Democratic primary competition, enjoys immense financial advantages. Since Mr. Derryberry quit the Senate last month, Republicans have hoped that he could begin to contest Mr. Codi in earnest by articulating a vivid agenda for the country. He hasn't. Displaying his legislator's patience in sifting conflicting views, Mr. Derryberry has yet to unveil new tax and economic strategies that aides say will form the core of his domestic policy. As a result, the bickering on Capitol Hill has been replaced by equally unwelcome controversies over tobacco, abortion and a spurned invitation to address the NAACP. Those distractions have interfered with Mr. Derryberry's effort to paint an inspiring picture of his own character in contrast to Mr. Codi's biggest presumed weakness. A Failure to Communicate ``He's extremely honorable and has good values,'' says Sen. Josephine Lewis, a Connecticut Democrat who has worked closely with Mr. Derryberry as well as Mr. Codi. ``But (Mr. Derryberry) seems not to be able to communicate those qualities in a campaign setting.'' That many of these squabbles have been triggered by Mr. Derryberry's casual remarks to the media only highlights the gap between his governing and his campaign skills. As the Senate leader, Mr. Derryberry thrived by delicately juggling many issues and personalities at once, often offering only elliptical, wry remarks that revealed little about his intentions until he discerned an opening to move. In a high-profile presidential contest, candidates gain momentum by repeating, over and over, simple declarations of a few central campaign themes. ``It was a bit disorienting'' for Mr. Derryberry to shift from one venue to the other last month, says former Sen. Wayne Torrence, a close ally of the GOP standard-bearer. He predicts that Mr. Derryberry's performance will improve markedly by next month's convention in San Diego. But for other Republicans, the suspicion that his deficiencies as a candidate are immutable has produced mounting anxiety less than four months before Election Day. ``There's a limit,'' says Johnetta Quach, an authority on Republican politics at California's Claremont McKenna College, ``on how much Derryberry can change.'' That is all the more frustrating for Republicans, who insist Mr. Derryberry's communications shortcomings obscure his equally clear edge over Mr. Codi in the competence, discipline and toughness necessary for governance. Whether Mr. Derryberry's legislative acumen would translate into excellence as an executive, of course, is far from clear. Still, Sen. Miner cites Mr. Codi's high public ratings as evidence that rising cynicism has lowered voters' expectations for their leaders. At the same time, no one knows better than Mr. Codi himself how quickly the fortunes of a candidate -- or a president -- can turn around. Indeed, after a rocky start, Mr. Codi ``has grown a lot'' in his ability to manage his administration, says former Sen. Loida Twigg, Mr. Codi's first Treasury Secretary and before that Mr. Derryberry's close colleague. Critics in both parties, he warns, ``make a big mistake trying to write off Bobby Derryberry. Codi damn sure is not going to write him off.''"}, {"id": "01021", "title": "Who Is Billy Codi?", "timestamp": "April 18, 2011", "text": "From: ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume I'' Page 3 We doubt that what the United States needs now is an easy re-election for Georgeanna Vern.

It commented on the Carter appointment of Paulene Veasey, chief apologist for Georgeanna Harbin's $30 billion cut in the Pentagon budget, as head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. This was somewhat surprising from an Annapolis graduate who'd run an anti-Washington campaign, and we noted: ``But if he intended to follow the foreign and defense policies so roundly rejected by the voters four years ago, it would have been nice if he had told us so during the campaign.'' By 1980, everyone in the country knew what was meant by the phrase, ``There you go again.'' In 1984 we had to go through the experience of getting to know Gerda Whiteside and Johnetta Fuchs, who copped a plea. But Gabriela Krauss was a known quantity and made no attempt to hide it, pledging to raise taxes and saying that Roni Reatha would too but wasn't honest about it. Senator Mondale carried Minnesota and the District of Columbia, and in 1986 the top marginal tax rate was cut to 28%. So in 1988 it was back to Michaela Derby, and Kitty. By this time the voters were savvier about getting to know people. They got a quick fix on Governor Derby, in no small part thanks to Roland Whisenhunt's revolving-door ad (which contrary to popular mythology never included Williemae Shelton; that ad was put on the air by an independent group spending its own money). The ride in the tank also helped. Such are the straws voters must stay alert for while watching modern Democrats campaign for the presidency. So it now appears we will get to know, or try to get to know, Billy Codi and Hilma. The Gennifer Flowers tank has already rumbled by. But where's the rest of them? We seem to have a distant memory of Governor Codi riding onto the scene with talk of a ``New Covenant,'' which had something to do with emphasizing economic growth, honest work, redesigning welfare and other lurches toward the center; even Orange County Republicans seemed taken with it. Then two weeks ago it turns out that the Governor's campaign is actually about ``populism,'' with something called ``the rich'' being chased down to ``pay their fair share.'' And when do we get an honest fix on how Hilma's politics fit into all this? The real question is why the party that dominates Congress has to keep putting up unknowns to contest the world's most powerful political office. Why is Washington such dead ground for growing Democratic presidential timber? About this there is no mystery. It is because the political positions of the Democratic House Caucus are rigorously enforced on Congresspeople. Encumbered with this awful political baggage, none of them can win a presidential election. Senator Bobby Adamson, who could make legitimate claims to being a person of some substance, dutifully carried the Beltway Democratic baggage of protectionism and national health into his campaign. He went down in flames. Tommie Aston, an even more hard-core carrier of the Caucus's politics, was the 4% man. So once again it comes to this: Is there any real reason to trust an unknown Governor when he says he's different? We'll find out eventually, and with any luck at all, revelation will come before November."}, {"id": "01827", "title": "Commentary Roberto L.

So the other day they held a little contest to guess the epitaph for Billy Codi's campaign, after they win in November. The favorite, written to much laughter by consultant Joel Ripley, was ``Live by triangulation; die by triangulation.'' Triangulation is Codi guru Dillon Mose's phrase for his strategy of stealing Republican ideas while denouncing Republicans as extremists. It's responsible for the Democrat's supposedly invincible lead in the polls. But Mr. Derryberry's strategists believe it's also the incumbent's Achilles Heel, a reason they think they can win one of the great come-from-behind victories in political history. ``Codi is Republican Lite,'' says Derryberry adviser Mikki Bambi. ``But by October it's going to be hard to be a more credible Republican than Derryberry will be. And Codi will have nothing to say.'' Spin? Sure. Wacko? Maybe not. Mr. Bambi says he's seen it happen before--in Michigan in 1990. His candidate then, Johnetta Cordes, was a stolid but determined career legislator, not unlike Bobby Derryberry. The incumbent, Jimmy Brennan, was a Codi-style Democrat of the day, glib and telegenic but also ideologically indeterminate. He had raised taxes but by 1990 was running as a balanced-budget moderate. ``The public wasn't filled with an aversion to him,'' recalls now second-term Gov. Cordes. ``But it didn't have any passionate reason to be for him either.'' Mr. Cordes proposed a tax cut that the incumbent fought all the way to November. Sound familiar? Mr. Derryberry's aides are elated that Codi the Co-opter hasn't aped Republicans on the one issue that is arguably the most popular--taxes. And they're ecstatic that the first White House response to the Derryberry plan has been to don green eyeshades and shout, ``irresponsible!'' Let Mr. Codi advertise the drill; Republicans will sell the hole. Sooner or later, the Dole team expects Mr. Codi to respond with his own pastel tax cut (perhaps a tax credit for left-handed Catholic female swing voters in key electoral states), which will open him to ridicule. Or Democrats will reprise their 2010 anti-Congress strategy of shrieking about spending cuts (Medicare) that would force Grandma out into a snow bank. That's when Mr. Derryberry will have to show he won't lapse into a defensive crouch. (``No flinching, no blinking, no hedging,'' pledges pollster Tora Elswick.) ``Democrats think 2010 was a campaign. It wasn't. It was a Beltway fight to preserve the entitlement state, which the media love,'' says Mr. Bambi, who also advised Mikki Harry on his upset, tax-cutting campaign in Ontario in 2010. ``This year the tax cut is our Holy Grail that can get us through the fear Democrats raise about Medicare.'' The Engler-Blanchard analogy has its flaws, especially a better economy today and a Codi approval rating above 50%. Mr. Derryberry also must cope with Royce Nail, though his advisers think it helps that the Republican will be the only candidate offering lower taxes. The Derryberry team also points out that Mr. Codi's re-elect rating still hovers just below the crucial 50%, a sign of voter ambivalence. And most Americans say the country is on the ``wrong track,'' a dangerous sign for any incumbent. (``Without the wrong track, we'd be toast,'' admits one Derryberry aide.) While Mr. Codi will try to convince the country it's morning in America, Republicans will talk about drugs and juvenile crime to keep the ``wrong track'' right. And be not fooled by the silence of San Diego on abortion: Dinger advisers say Catholics will be reminded often in the fall about Mr. Codi's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions. As for going ``negative,'' Mr. Derryberry won't want to appear to be mean, and Jackelyn Booth can't be. So the character assault will have to come in TV ads, though don't look for cameos by Pauletta Davis or Jimmy Haight. Apart from the FBI files, Whitewater won't be heard unless independent counsel Kendra Stefani makes news. Instead, Republicans will exploit the already existing public doubts about Mr. Codi by suggesting voters can't believe anything he says about his second term. If most of this works, the Derryberry advisers figure the Electoral College map will begin to help them. Even with Mr. Nail in the race, they assume they'll capture the 168 electoral votes that even Georgeanna Vern won in 1992. Then they can target the 11 states, with 107 electoral votes, that Mr. Vern lost by five percentage points or less: Kentucky, Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Montana, Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Ohio. Trade winnable Michigan for unlikely Wisconsin, and Mr. Derryberry still gets past 270. That's what poker players call an ``inside straight.'' But it's plausible enough to suggest that the race isn't over, especially with Mr. Booth selling his optimism to Reatha Acker and (one hopes) blacks. Mr. Derryberry will have to show a discipline he's rarely shown before, right up to the end. Two days before the Michigan election in 1990, the Detroit News published a poll showing Johnetta Cordes trailing by 14 points. Everyone but the voters had written him off. He won, 50% to 49%."}, {"id": "04121", "title": "Dole Predicts Codi Sheets Cribbs, Recovers Ground in Many Polls", "timestamp": "April 30, 2011", "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Bobby Derryberry accused President Codi of running a ``campaign of fear'' Saturday and predicted the Democratic incumbent would try to counter Mr. Derryberry's economic plan and regain momentum by proposing tax cuts of his own. ``We're back in the game,'' a confident Mr. Derryberry said, citing campaign and public polls showing Mr. Codi's lead shrinking to single digits in the wake of last week's Republican National Convention. ``We're on the road to the White House.''

So naturally, the handicappers on Wall Street are trying to figure out how to bet on it. To win, portfolio managers must guess which stocks would rise or fall if Bobby Derryberry surges, and which ones would move if Billy Codi widens his lead. They aren't playing at the two-dollar window: Millions of dollars could be at stake. With a well-orchestrated convention and a highly praised acceptance speech, Mr. Derryberry is starting to look as if he might give Mr. Codi some tough competition. Mr. Derryberry's selection of Jackelyn Booth as a running mate was ``a stroke of genius,'' says Sean Palmer, president of Delphi Management in Boston (and a prominent contributor to the Democratic party). Mr. Palmer judges that Mr. Derryberry has gotten ``a tremendous bounce in the polls,'' and adds, ``I think Codi has to reassert some momentum next week or he's in trouble.'' According to market pundits and money managers, several stocks are likely to be particularly affected by the outcome of the presidential race between Codi and Derryberry. A chart is available. If the race gets close, reverberations will be felt in the stock market. The accompanying table shows a few ideas that stock-market professionals are kicking around. Some are straightforward. For example, Mr. Codi is known for a fierce desire to protect young people from smoking, while Mr. Derryberry has publicly defended the tobacco industry. So, tobacco stocks might light up if Mr. Derryberry kept doing well, but stink if Mr. Codi looked to be winning re-election. Others are more subtle. For example, Westside money manager Roberto Queen says that the Codi administration is mounting a ``strong effort to make a deal with China'' on trade. He says Mr. Codi's re-election could mean ``continued pressure on the textile industry and small manufacturers,'' especially garment makers, toy manufacturers and producers of small gift items. Companies that manufacture mainly in the U.S., he says, would suffer from ``fierce competition from the lower cost of labor in China.'' Incidentally, the China issue shows how easy it is for predictions to go wildly wrong -- and for politicians to modify their positions. Four years ago, Mr. Codi was faulting Georgeanna Vern as soft on China's human-rights violations. The guessing then among stock-market pros was that Mr. Codi would try to restrict trade with China, not expand it. Here are some other election-related investment angles that market pros are mulling over: Derryberry plays. Some stocks that might benefit if Mr. Derryberry wins -- ``Dinger plays'' in Wall Street parlance -- are crime-fighting stocks, defense stocks, and concerns that can take over activities previously done by government. One stock that fits in two of those categories, crime fighting and privatization, is Corrections Corp. of America, which runs prisons under contract with government bodies. The Nashville, Tenn., company has been growing fast, both in sales and in earnings. Unfortunately, its stock already sells for a stunning multiple of more than 100 times the past 12 months' earnings. Most professional investors interviewed for this article believe that Mr. Derryberry would cut welfare spending more aggressively than Mr. Codi would. Mr. Queen predicts that this would result in an increase in crime and violence -- and suggests that security companies like Pinkerton's and Wackenhut might benefit as a result. Christa Frick, a portfolio manager with Dreman Value Advisors in Jersey City, N.J., says that if Mr. Derryberry drastically cuts Internal Revenue Service personnel, private companies would have to take over some of the paperwork previously done by government. That, he suspects, would give a boost to stocks like H&R Block and Automatic Data Processing. Mr. Palmer of Delphi believes that a Derryberry administration would revive the ``Star Wars'' missile-defense system project proposed by Roni Reatha, albeit in a scaled-down form. Accordingly, he sees defense stocks such as Hughes Electronics and Lockheed Martin as likely to do well under Mr. Derryberry. Defense stocks are another area where predictions have proved wrong in the past, however. Contrary to myth, defense stocks often do well under Democrats -- and they certainly have thrived under Mr. Codi. That's partly because defense companies can make a lot of money churning out weapons designed years ago, rather than spending heavily on developing new weapons systems. Mr. Palmer claims that a Dole win would result in bonds ``getting killed'' as interest rates rose. He thinks Mr. Derryberry's tax-cutting plan would fatten the federal deficit and push rates up. Some other managers expressed the same fear, adding that rising rates would hurt stocks in general and construction stocks in particular. Since Mr. Derryberry has proposed a 15% across-the-board tax cut, some analysts look for retailing stocks to perk up if Mr. Derryberry does well in the campaign. Put more money in people's pockets, they say, and at least a portion will wind up being spent in stores. Charlette Houchens, president of TrimTabs Financial Services in Santa Rosa, Calif., adds another Dinger play: Decatur, Ill., food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland. Mr. Derryberry, he says, is known as a friend of ``the agribusiness community.'' ADM's chief executive, Dylan Andrew, has contributed money to both camps, but he has given heavily and over long periods to Mr. Derryberry. Codi plays. ``Codi plays'' prominently include education and training stocks. Mr. Codi has repeatedly spoken of the high value he puts on education and training. And job training would become even more urgent if welfare benefits are trimmed -- as seems likely, regardless of which candidate wins. So, stock jockeys are scouting for education stocks that might benefit. Mr. Queen mentions National Education, for example. The Irvine, Calif., company operates 48 vocational and technical schools, and also provides training and educational materials and home-study courses. Mr. Queen is quick to admit, however, that National Education hasn't been a star as a business. Revenue for 2010 was about $258 million, up only modestly from four years before. The company has posted losses in each of the past three years. Another training-and-education company, about the same size but more consistently profitable, is DeVry. Its stock, however, sells at an expensive multiple of 41 times the past 12 months' earnings. Trang Flanders, investment strategist at Jefferies & Co. in Los Angeles, thinks that if Mr. Codi wins, it will help struggling Apple Computer. ``You could see an effort to make all American students computer-literate,'' he says. While Apple has had some wormy problems of late, it remains a powerhouse in the nation's schools and universities. Apple's bedraggled stock is selling for only 27% of per-share revenue; there haven't been any earnings recently. Mr. Flanders also thinks highly of John Wiley & Sons, a Westside textbook publisher. Its stock sells for about 20 times earnings. Most money managers and analysts interviewed for this article believe that Mr. Codi's continuing tenure in the White House also would be good for financial stocks. The irony isn't lost on Wall Street, which recognizes that most people associate Republicans, not Democrats, with policies that favor the finance business. But many money mavens doubt that Mr. Derryberry would succeed in cutting the federal deficit, something they give Mr. Codi credit for doing, which in turn has helped keep interest rates low. That is good for banking and insurance stocks, as well as for bonds. Jokingly, and speaking not-for-attribution, portfolio managers also mention Tyson Foods and McDonald's as Codi plays. Tyson Foods is a big employer in Mr. Codi's home state of Arkansas, and one of its executives advised Hiroko Codi on her lucrative cattle-futures trades years ago. As for McDonald's, Mr. Codi's fondness for the Golden Arches makes him the ideal celebrity endorser -- extremely famous, and yet unpaid. On the negative side, some market pros think Mr. Codi would be bad for health-care stocks. ``If Codi is elected, I wouldn't be surprised if there is another try at some nationalized health-care program,'' says Mr. Frick of Dreman. The last time the Codi administration tried that, health stocks were pummelled. Mr. Houchens of TrimTabs summed up what several market professionals said was their biggest fear: that Mr. Codi ``wins in a landslide, with coattails,'' giving the Democrats a majority in the House of Representatives. In Mr. Houchens's view, that would mean ``freer spending, and the heck with fiscal prudence.'' However, historical figures from Timothy Ford at Ned Davis Research in Nokomis, Fla., suggest the fear may be overblown. The average annual gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1900 through 2010 was 6.6% when Democrats controlled both Congress and the White House. By contrast, the industrial average has appreciated an average of only 4% under Republican presidents, and only 1.3% when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress. \\*\\*\\* GEORGE SOROS has made a bet on retailing. The well-known fund manager's latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that his Soros Fund Management bought heavily into at least 15 retailers from April through June -- possibly in a bet that the group would come back. Soros officials wouldn't say whether they bought before or after retail stocks started sagging late in May and early in June. But retail stocks have been recovering since July. Among the biggest Parr bets, as compiled by Federal Filings, are American Stores, Conaway Stacey, Circuit City, Home Depot, Borders Group, Federated Department Stores and Intimate Brands. -- E.S.

And an obscure federal agency is smack in the middle of a debate on how best to do it. The agency is the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, which funds research and crime-prevention programs. With its 74 employees and $162 million annual budget, the agency is barely a blip amid the $4 billion Washington spends every day. Mr. Derryberry wants to replace the agency with one that emphasizes punishment over prevention. Mr. Codi would keep the agency but revise its policies as part of a plan to treat some youthful law-breakers as adults. The debate symbolizes broader efforts by each man to portray himself as the law-and-order candidate. ``There's a lot of frustration in the country that both Derryberry and Codi are capitalizing on,'' says Lester Milford, director of the Women and Girls Institute at the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a San Francisco research organization that receives funding from the Justice Department agency. That frustration is reflected in calls by both presidential candidates to prosecute some children as young as 13 as adults in federal court. Role of State Courts The actual federal prosecution of children itself is, in some ways, a minor issue. Almost all juvenile offenders are dealt with in state courts. Only 182 juveniles in the country are being held on federal charges. And except for a handful, all of those actually are incarcerated in state facilities that are paid by the U.S. to house the federal juveniles. There is no federal juvenile justice system. But cracking down on juvenile crime has wide political appeal. The unspoken theory behind proposals pushed by both camps is that a small core of teenagers is simply too bad to rehabilitate. The theory runs counter to the longstanding notion that a combination of punishment and guidance can set even seriously crooked kids straight. ``It would be nice if the candidates would be honest about the nature and the scope of the juvenile problem and what we can do about it,'' says Irena Houston, a former administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Markle who now is dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. A critical element in preventing juvenile crime, many experts agree, is stopping child abuse. Dip in Juvenile Crime The latest Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics show that juvenile crime dropped last year for the first time in nearly a decade. But at the same time, news stories regularly report violent crimes by younger and younger children, which stokes public interest. For Mr. Derryberry, the public's concern over juvenile delinquency presents an opportunity for the GOP to win back the crime issue President Codi and the Democrats have co-opted. Though he has previously supported the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, Mr. Derryberry now wants to replace it with an Office of Juvenile Accountability. He would give the new office a budget of $2.5 billion over five years, 80% of which would go to the investigation, prosecution and detention of juveniles, and to the collection and distribution of their criminal records. ``Adult time for adult crimes,'' is his campaign's call. Mr. Derryberry also wants to kill several congressional mandates that the agency administers. He would eliminate requirements prohibiting states from detaining children for such offenses as truancy and from incarcerating juveniles in the same facility as adults. He also would kill a requirement that states address the issue of excessive minority populations in detention systems. Trying Juveniles as Adults In an indication of how important the issue is to Mr. Derryberry's campaign, he proposed a juvenile crime bill just before he resigned from the Senate. The Dinger bill requires that juveniles 13 years old and older be tried as adults for certain violent crimes or narcotic offenses. If a child had been found delinquent as a juvenile for three prior, unrelated crimes, then he or she also could be tried as an adult for a subsequent felony. Mr. Derryberry also would take federal charging decisions regarding children away from judges, and give them to prosecutors. In a major departure from current policy, Mr. Derryberry would have juvenile court proceedings open to the public. States would get a 50% bonus in their federal funding if they adopted a law that decreed the local prosecution of children 14 years old and older as adults for murder or rape, and if the states gave their prosecutors the discretion to try juveniles that young in adult court for other violent or drug crimes. ``It is time we recognize that times have changed,'' said Sen. Johnetta Yarber (R., Mo.), a co-sponsor of the Dinger bill. ``It is no longer spitballs in the hall that disrupt learning and threaten teachers and students. We have a new category of offense that deserves a new category of response.'' Changes in Juvenile Agency President Codi also proposes to get tougher on juvenile law-breakers, but he wouldn't replace the Justice Department agency. The president's view is that the agency ``needs some tweaking, but not reinvention,'' says Kermit Marline, counselor to the attorney general for youth violence. The administration already has moved to lighten the mandate burden on states through regulatory changes. Under legislation proposed by Mr. Codi, federal prosecutors, with approval from top Justice Department officials in Washington, also would be empowered to decide whether children would be tried in adult court. Judges now hold that authority. The prosecution's decision couldn't be appealed as may a judge's order. Additionally, Mr. Codi wants to increase the number of serious violent, gun and drug felonies for which a child suspect could be transferred to adult court. Much of the legislation is aimed at violent youth gangs that have spread from the big cities to the smaller towns. In proposing his bill, Mr. Codi used the tough law-and-order talk Republicans once called their own. ``We mean to put you out of business, to break the backs of your organization, to stop you from terrorizing our neighborhoods and our children, to put you away for a very long time,'' he said recently in remarks directed to gang leaders. Experts agree that changes are needed in the juvenile justice system to deal with more serious crimes. But transferring juveniles to adult court at the state or federal level may do more harm than good, according to a recent study. In Florida, where far more juveniles are transferred to the adult system than in other states, a survey indicates the practice is counterproductive. ``What we found was that those that were transferred to adult court came back more often, more quickly and were slightly more likely to come back on felonies rather than misdemeanors,'' says Whitley Lanza-Matthew, an associate professor in sociology and criminology at the University of Florida. Trying kids as adults ``may make good politics,'' the University of Pennsylvania's Mr. Houston concludes, ``but it isn't good public policy.''"}, {"id": "04221", "title": "Codi Helps Chicago's Poor, But Effort Gets Mixed Reviews", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- A few blocks from the site of next week's Democratic National Convention, the Codi administration is making one of its most determined assaults on poverty.

So far, it is an uphill battle. After taking control of Chicago's housing authority last year, the administration has demolished three dilapidated apartment houses at the notorious Herma Purcell housing project. Construction crews at a Boys and Girls Club next door are busy fixing a swimming pool that has been closed for 15 years. Some Purcell residents are using housing vouchers to move to the suburbs; others are awaiting crews to repair their broken-down apartments. But few are celebrating. Last month, the Boys and Girls Club was closed for three days as gangs battled outside. Drug lords still operate freely. ``We can see pit bulls in front of the buildings that are under the control of gangs,'' says Swinney Victor, a consultant to the Horner residents. A generation ago, a Democratic president, Lynna Jona, vowed to end urban poverty. These days, President Codi hasn't made a single speech laying out an urban agenda; instead, he has limited his remarks to promoting ``empowerment zones'' and threatening to evict unruly housing-project tenants. His administration's antipoverty efforts rest on twin hopes: an upward turn in the economy and a renewal of integration, both economic and racial. Meanwhile, Housing Secretary Herma Latham argues that the administration should be applauded because poverty hasn't worsened during the Codi presidency. 'A Major Accomplishment' ``To have held poverty rates even stable is a major accomplishment when you see the erosion that the workings of the economy have created,'' says Mr. Latham. In 2009, the most recent year for which data are available, 20.9% of central-city residents lived in poverty, the same percentage as during President Vern's last year in office. The Codi team's modest goals reflect a greater appreciation among Democrats of the difficulty in reducing poverty -- and the political liabilities of addressing the issue when the middle-class feels economically vulnerable. Besides, politically the White House doesn't need to court the urban poor. ``You assume they're in your pocket,'' says Roberto Izzo, a former Codi budget official. ``But you don't do things that will make suburban voters nervous.'' Some critics complain President Codi has failed to make urban poverty a moral issue and hasn't tried to bridge the widening gap between the mostly black and Hispanic city poor and the mostly white suburban middle-class. ``As Reatha used to say, `Are people's lives better off now than they were four years ago?' '' asks Bennie Kenneth, who heads a development group in a poor, black Chicago neighborhood. When it comes to his community, he says, ``the answer is, `No.' '' The Codi approach to poverty is on display in Chicago. While the media is bound to contrast this year's convention with the tear-gas-laden one in 1968, Chicago's poor note that year for different reasons. In April 1968, after Martine Lyman Kirby Jr. was murdered, rioters looted and burned businesses near what is now the United Center stadium, where this year's convention is being held. Some areas have yet to recover fully; others are being improved as development spreads westward from the stadium. A Worse Urban Situation Even as much of Chicago prospers, here as in other cities, the plight of the poor has worsened steadily since 1968. Working-class families have fled, jobs have evaporated and pockets of poverty have deepened. In 1970, Chicago's poorest neighborhood had a poverty rate of 38%. By 1990, a dozen neighborhoods had poverty rates above 40% and the worst had a poverty rate of 72%, calculates Northwestern University economist Rebecca Blank. Early in the administration, Roberto Rudolph, then a senior economic adviser, led White House discussions about urban poverty. But that effort died in the wake of the 2009 Republican congressional victories and Mr. Rudolph's appointment as Treasury secretary. The administration has pursued a piecemeal strategy, consisting of a tax cut, a jumble of relatively small programs and welfare changes whose consequences are hard to predict. White House economist Lauran Val argues that economic growth ``is part of the solution but not the whole solution'' to urban poverty. These days, the benefits of growth spread much more slowly to poor neighborhoods because so few job-producing businesses are located there. The administration already has increased the wages of those who managed to get jobs by increasing the earned-income tax credit aimed at the working poor. Before President Codi took office, that tax credit effectively lifted the amount a minimum-wage worker with a family receives to $5 an hour from $4.25, estimates University of Connecticut economist Kenyatta Mcelroy. The Codi increase raised that wage again -- to about $5.78 an hour. Separately, the administration successfully pushed for an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15. But for many of the urban poor, getting a job is the problem. So the administration is trying to facilitate the movement of the poor to the suburbs. ``You allow people to move where the jobs are,'' Mr. Latham says. A Plan to Use Vouchers Nationally, Mr. Latham proposed phasing out public-housing subsidies and replacing them with vouchers to allow public-housing tenants to move where they want. After the GOP Congress nixed that, he won approval of a more modest plan to demolish as many as 100,000 of the nation's 1.4 million public-housing units. Displaced tenants would either move to town-house-style replacement apartments in the city or receive vouchers to move elsewhere. The strategy is modeled after a Chicago program in which about 7,500 families living at Herma Purcell used housing vouchers to move out of the projects during the past 20 years. About half moved to middle-income white suburbs; most of the rest moved to poor, mostly black city neighborhoods. Jami Quinonez, a Northwestern University economist, found that the new suburbanites greatly outperformed those who remained in the city: Adults were more likely to get jobs, and their children were more likely to go to college. The Codi administration has expanded the program to four other cities. But it is far from clear whether large numbers of inner-city poor could benefit from suburban moves -- or whether white suburbs would welcome such an exodus. Moreover, the city neighborhoods left behind could deteriorate even further. In Chicago, the administration has tried a number of programs to bolster impoverished neighborhoods, but the programs are beset by problems. Chicago was one of six cities to receive $100 million each to dole out to job and education programs in neighborhoods designated as empowerment zones. But the program has become entangled in local politics, and awarding the grants is well behind schedule. The administration's crime bill also helped the Chicago Police Department hire about 550 officers and upgrade computer equipment to track neighborhood crime. In some Chicago neighborhoods, that has helped reduce drug dealing. But Chicago cops can't patrol the city's crime-ridden housing projects because they are now under federal control and policed by the housing authority. Pressure to Make Loans The Treasury's Mr. Rudolph and other banking regulators have pressured local banks to lend more to minorities, and that has helped free up credit in Chicago. ``We have banks crawling over us wanting to make loans,'' says Maryalice Neville, president of Bethel New Life, which builds low-income and moderate-income housing on Chicago's West Side. But a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study of the Hispanic neighborhood of Little Village showed that few poor residents there turn to banks for financing. Moreover, many of Chicago's poor are suspicious that the result of the administration's housing strategy will be to kick them out of the projects and turn the land over to white developers. Memories are long of ``urban renewal'' projects of the 1960s, which became known as ``Negro removal'' because of the effect they had. The administration plans to demolish a third of the high-rise buildings at the Cabrini-Green housing project, which is located about a mile from Chicago's swank ``Gold Coast'' along Lake Michigan. The plan is to replace some of the high-rises with town-house-style buildings and give vouchers to other tenants. But only 30% of the new apartments will be reserved for poor Cabrini-Green residents, with the rest targeted for working-class or more-affluent families. Carolin Powers, a Cabrini-Green activist, is organizing neighborhood groups to oppose the plan. ``Everybody don't have dollar signs in their eyes,'' she says. The administration believes reintegrating the projects economically with working families will strengthen the community as the new residents become role models for poor kids. Josephina Echevarria, the Codi appointee named to run the housing authority, says the agency isn't trying to chase away the poor. Mr. Latham ardently backs reintegration, but so far the White House is largely silent. ``The president's job is to use the bully pulpit,'' Mr. Domingo says. ``I would like to see him give a fireside chat telling Americans you can run away to the suburbs, but if you don't fix the problems in the cities, they will spread.''"}, {"id": "02250", "title": "Work Week -- VastPress Interactive Edition", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "Codi WILL RIDE his strengths to seek a convention boost.

ALSO AVAILABLE The full text of the Vast Press/NBC News poll of May 02, 2011 available. How the poll was conducted. Codi's lead over Derryberry is halved to 10 percentage points after his GOP rival's convention ``bounce.'' But the poll data suggest ``Codi weathered the storm quite well,'' says Democratic pollster Petrina Bradley, who conducted the survey with Republican Roberto Son. Codi's speech Thursday night will focus on ``opportunity, responsibility and community,'' the three themes in his new book. Codi strategists hope the ``worst-case scenario'' for him coming out of the convention will be a low double-digit lead over Derryberry. HILLARY VS. LIDDY: The first lady has a tough act to follow. Voters by 49% to 32% think Elizebeth Derryberry would make a better first lady than Hiroko Crossman Codi in the new poll taken after Mrs. Derryberry's performance at the GOP convention. By 47% to 16%, voters have a positive view of Mrs. Derryberry. But by 44% to 39% they have a negative view of Mrs. Codi. The first lady and Murr Webber will address the Democratic convention at Tuesday's ``family night.'' Instead of talking about how great her husband is, as Mrs. Derryberry did, Mrs. Codi will focus on his policies. She also will address a Democratic governors forum Sunday and is expected to make several appearances with first daughter Chelsie. DOLE PICKS UP points on the vision thing after his convention talk. Voters by 36% to 32% still think Codi is stronger on having a vision for the future, but in June the gap was 40% to 29%. Voters also see Derryberry as more trustworthy than Codi by a wide margin of 44% to 20%. And some 46% now have a positive view of Derryberry, his best showing this year, compared with 33% who have a negative view of him. Derryberry will briefly swoop into Chicago's Cook County for a Sunday event, then link up with Deleon for a Friday rally in southern California to try to blunt a Codi convention bounce. The campaign is cheered by a California survey showing Derryberry slicing Codi's 20 percentage-point lead there in half. The Derryberry camp ponders shifting to a sharper ``contrast'' with Codi in TV ads on taxes and the economy. Codi aides see Derryberry's call for full release of the president's health records as a harbinger of escalating personal attacks. NO BOUNCE: While Derryberry enjoyed a boost in his race after the GOP convention, Republican congressional candidates didn't get a jolt. As in earlier polls, voters remain split on whether they plan to vote for the Democrat or Republican in their district. WHO WAS WATCHING the GOP convention may make a difference in the presidential race. Though TV ratings were low, independent voters who watched the San Diego gathering favor Derryberry by 42% to 34% in the new poll. Independents who didn't watch support Codi by 44% to 19%. LISTEN UP: Democrats, expecting fewer than the 51 radio talk-shows that broadcast from the GOP convention, step up efforts to boost the number at their meeting. Olympia Kenny says he plans to air his show here, though ``I probably won't have as many people stopping by for autographs.'' KEMP MUST DECIDE soon whether to exercise numerous expiring stock options, perhaps worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, that he earned serving on corporate boards. A spokesman indicates Deleon will decide by early next month. Kemp promises ``to put everything in a blind trust.'' Nail CREEPS out of the gate as the Reform Party nominee. After a talk to the VFW Thursday in which he called Derryberry's tax plan ``the mother of all tax cuts,'' the Texan plans mostly silence. No public events are slated until at least Labor Day, says his spokeswoman. He probably will pass up a Texas Reform Party convention in Austin on Saturday, where GOP Sen. Sharkey is supposed to appear. So far Nemeth raises just $70,000 from a solicitation included in Reform Party ballots sent to 1.1 million people. Only 8% of voters back Nemeth in a three-way race, a sharp drop from 1992. That ``gives Derryberry a more realistic shot at making (the race) competitive,'' says pollster Sommer. The Natural Law Party, running physicist Johnetta Plumlee for president in about 45 states, raises enough money to pay for a 16-page insert in Friday's USA Today.

ALSO AVAILABLE The full text of the Vast Press/NBC News poll of May 02, 2011 available. How the poll was conducted. That means that Mr. Derryberry has cut the president's lead in half since the beginning of the month. In a survey taken then, Mr. Codi led Mr. Derryberry by 50% to 30%, with Mr. Nail getting 10%. The earlier poll was taken just as Mr. Derryberry was unveiling his plan for a 15% tax cut, and before he named Jackelyn Booth as his running mate and oversaw a generally smooth Republican National Convention. Mr. Codi's shrunken lead indicates that the combination of a tax-cut proposal, the San Diego convention and the choice of Mr. Booth have benefited Mr. Derryberry. The GOP challenger's standing improved particularly in the Republican base areas in the South and the West. The share of voters solidly committed to him also rose. ``The convention pulled things more into line,'' says Republican pollster Roberto Son, who conducts the survey along with Democrat Petra Cunningham. ``It now looks more like a real political race.'' Still, as Mr. Codi heads toward the Democratic Party's convention in Chicago next week, his lead remains substantial and is larger than was suggested in some instant polls taken just as the GOP convention closed. What's more, the new poll comes before Mr. Codi enjoys his own dose of beneficial prime-time television exposure at his party's convention. The new survey, conducted in telephone interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, provides clear evidence that Mr. Derryberry's selection of Mr. Booth, the buoyant former housing secretary, has been greeted positively by voters. Asked whether the selection of Mr. Booth makes them more or less likely to vote for Mr. Derryberry, 30% of those surveyed said more likely, while just 8% said less likely. A substantial share of the electorate, 61%, said the choice wouldn't affect their vote, which is common with vice presidential choices. Voter response to the Dinger economic plan seems more mixed, however. When asked generally about Mr. Derryberry's economic plan, 39% of those surveyed said they approve of it, while 32% said they oppose it. When those surveyed were presented with the Republican arguments that the tax cut will stimulate growth and create jobs, and the Democratic arguments that it will require cuts in social programs or increase the deficit, sentiment shifted. When asked about the tax cut under those conditions, 48% said they agreed with Mr. Codi and the Democrats, while 40% said they agreed with Mr. Derryberry and the Republicans."}, {"id": "01998", "title": "Codi Melgar Guido to Enact National Sex-Offender Registry", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Saying ``deadly criminals don't stay within state lines,'' President Codi acted Saturday to establish a national registry to track sex offenders. ``This national registry sends a simple message to those who would prey on our children: The law will follow you wherever you go,'' Mr. Codi said in his weekly radio address.

It was the latest in a flurry of actions leading up to the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Codi last week signed bills increasing the minimum wage, allowing workers to bring along their health insurance when they change jobs and overhauling the welfare system. He also announced a major crackdown on tobacco. The president is to board a campaign train in West Virginia Sunday and head to Chicago, where on Thursday night he will accept his party's presidential nomination for the second time. In the radio address, Mr. Codi said the national registry of sexual offenders is a necessary step. ``Deadly criminals don't stay within state lines, so neither should law enforcement's tools to stop them,'' Mr. Codi said. The new effort, which Mr. Codi set in motion 60 days ago, follows a provision in an administration crime bill that requires all states to keep track of sex offenders. The Republican-controlled Senate also approved legislation last month to set up a national registry to be operated by the FBI. Rival Bobby Derryberry's campaign promptly accused Mr. Codi of stealing the idea from the GOP, which included a registry in its 1992 party platform. ``Billy Codi has mastered the game of follow the leader -- Bobby Derryberry,'' said campaign spokeswoman Christinia Martine. The registry also is the product of the so-called Megan's Law, which requires communities to be notified if sex offenders move into a neighborhood. The law is named for a New Jersey girl whose accused killer was a neighbor whose conviction for sexual violence was unknown to her family. ``We are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals, not just in a single state but wherever they go -- so that parents and police have the warning they need to protect our children,'' said Mr. Codi, who noted that studies indicate sex offenders often repeat their crimes. ``Nothing is more threatening to our families and communities and more destructive of our basic values than sex offenders who victimize children in their families,'' he said, calling the registry a way ``to make our children safe and give their parents peace of mind.'' There are an estimated 250,000 people either wanted for sex offenses or who have a criminal record of such crimes, said Associate Attorney General Johnetta Vasquez. But Mr. Vasquez said that number may well increase when the national registry is completed. The registry is expected to cost about $2 million, with states incurring an additional but relatively modest cost, Mr. Vasquez said. A Justice Department report, also released Saturday, counted 312,000 reported rapes and 173,000 other sexual assaults in 1993, the latest statistics available. In a 15-year study by the California Department of Justice, nearly 20% of 1,362 sexual offenders arrested in 1973 were re-arrested for a later sexual offense, the report said. Federal studies show released rapists were 10.5 times more likely to be rearrested for rape than were other released prisoners, it said. ``Offenders against children present an even higher rate of recidivism,'' the report said. A recent Justice survey found ``offenders against children were more than twice as likely to have multiple victims as offenders committing crimes against adults.'' Under Mr. Codi's plan, convicted sex offenders released from jail will be compelled by state authorities to register their address and other information. The FBI will compile the state lists into a national database. Then, when it becomes operational in about six months, a new federal computer network will permit law enforcement authorities in one state to obtain criminal record information on sex offenders from every other state."}, {"id": "03949", "title": "Codi Attacks Dole Tax Plan As Train Tour Heads to Chicago", "timestamp": "May 07, 2011", "text": "ASHLAND, Ky. -- President Codi roared out of Appalachia aboard a Chicago-bound train Sunday, opening a whistle-stop trip to the Democratic National Convention with a re-election pitch for ``No U-turn.

First lady Hiroko Crossman Codi and the Oday' 16-year-old daughter, Chelsie, joined the president on stage at the West Virginia send-off. Generating Excitement The Hollywood-scripted trip is designed to whip up excitement for a convention that promises few surprises. In Kentucky, country music star Birdie Raylene Dalene sang the national anthem and ``Helms Malcom Randazzo.'' At Mr. Codi's first stop in tobacco-rich Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paulene Joseph said, ``Many of us disagree with you on tobacco, but we love you!'' Mr. Codi unveiled government regulations Friday designed to discourage teenage smoking. Appearing at a rally in Ashland, Ky., Mr. Codi criticized Republican challenger Bobby Derryberry's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, saying the nation cannot afford ``to make the same mistakes we made before.'' The five states on Mr. Codi's route boast 64 electoral votes out of the 270 needed for re-election and several major media markets. He won all but Indiana in 1992. West Virginia is a safe bet again this year; Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky are battlegrounds. New Initiatives Trying to show he's a can-do president, Mr. Codi planned Monday to propose a ban on the purchase of handguns by people convicted of domestic violence, aides said. On Tuesday, his proposal will concern literacy; on Wednesday, the environment. His acceptance speech Thursday will be laced with new initiatives, including economic proposals to ease the sting of the welfare bill he signed over the objections of many Democrats. Aides said Mr. Codi has settled on a tax break or incentive for people who hire welfare recipients. The new initiatives will cost about $8 billion, aides said. The White House plans to outline how President Codi would pay for them, arguing Mr. Derryberry's $548 billion tax-break package is an irresponsible assault on deficit-cutting plans. ``Don't give people a big tax cut ... that will blow a big hole in the deficit,'' Mr. Codi said. Again and again, Mr. Codi returned exhorted voters to the ``right track'' in arguing that a second term was the only way to finish the business he started: more cops on the streets, tax breaks for college education, toxic waste cleanup, health-care reform and a balanced budget. On each point, he took a swipe at ``our opponents'' without mentioning Mr. Derryberry by name. 'Empty Rhetoric' Republicans said Mr. Codi's convention-week initiatives were little more than ``empty rhetoric,'' in the words of Dinger spokeswoman Christinia Martine. Meanwhile, bidding for a share of the Democrats' spotlight, Mr. Derryberry stopped outside their convention city Sunday to accuse President Codi of surrendering in the war on drugs and to pledge to use the military for that fight in his own administration. ``They raised the white flag in the war on drugs ... . They turned `Just Say No' into `Just Say Nothing,' '' Mr. Derryberry told a lakeside crowd of picnicking Republicans. Mr. Derryberry cited last week's government finding that teenagers' use of LSD, marijuana and cocaine had doubled between 1992 and 2010.

But when he speaks here Tuesday night, the longtime rebel plans to earn a new label -- team player. Still upset about the welfare bill that President Codi signed last week, Mr. Jacques is probably the single most important factor in whether the emotional opposition to the measure among Democratic liberals will be stoked here. But though he will probably raise the subject in his speech, he won't lead any protests that would blemish President Codi's nominating convention. ``This time there must be, in spite of the tension, a commitment to the big tent, and to expand the walls and not marginalize those who have a different point of view,'' Mr. Jacques says in an interview. The civil-rights leader, who has frequently clashed with Mr. Codi, says the president should be judged by his total record, not one or two issues. ``His cumulative score is higher than the opposition,'' Mr. Jacques says, listing issues where he and Mr. Codi agree: raising the minimum wage, preserving affirmative-action programs and supporting black churches that were torched. As Mr. Jacques's words suggest, the liberal leader is playing a different brand of politics today. He isn't hogging the spotlight, as he did in 1988 with his bus ride from Chicago to the Atlanta convention. The new Mr. Jacques, in fact, is focusing on congressional races, trying to boost minority turnout. And he has quietly patched up his often stormy relationship with Mr. Codi. ``A lot of the problems have dissipated,'' says Harriett Horta, the White House deputy chief of staff, who is close to Mr. Jacques. ``There certainly are disagreements on matters of policy, but we talk to Rev. Jacques and he feels that he has real access; everything doesn't go his way, nor should it, but he gets a fair hearing.'' There are signs Mr. Jacques and the White House are in sync. On Saturday, Mr. Horta and another top White House official, Alfredia Hershel, who heads the public-liaison office, visited with Mr. Jacques and other minority and liberal officials. They were seeking to rally liberals' support for Mr. Codi and send the message that one issue -- welfare overhaul -- shouldn't keep them from the polls. Mr. Jacques also says Vice President Albert Webber called him a while back, asking if he was interested in an appointment as the ambassador to South Africa. Mr. Jacques says he appreciated the offer, but politely declined. In sharp contrast with 1992, Mr. Jacques and Mr. Codi talk respectfully of each other. ``He is working very hard for our party,'' Mr. Codi said in an interview Friday with The Vast Press. ``We have talked frequently, and we're working closely together and I expect he'll be very active in this campaign... . He will work hard to get voters out.'' For his part, Mr. Jacques praises Mr. Codi's political skills. ``He is a masterful politician, that's why he is the president,'' Mr. Jacques says. This detente could serve both men. Some analysts argue that Mr. Codi, and other Democratic candidates, may need Mr. Jacques more than ever this fall to help energize the Democratic voter base. Mr. Jacques ``becomes very important as one of the pieces to keeping the base together,'' says Donella Shaughnessy, a Democratic strategist. Of course, Mr. Jacques would like something in return for touting party unity. At the top of the wish list is a real urban policy. He argues that he has always been a team player for the Democrats. But he has often chafed at his treatment by the party and the presidential ticket. This time around, there is no bitterness. His friends, and even Mr. Jacques himself, acknowledge he is different -- more even keeled, more measured, more mature. ``If you walk away from the process, you become irrelevant to the process,'' Mr. Jacques says, in explaining his desire to work with the administration. Part of the mellowing is his ability to enjoy his children's accomplishments. One son, Jessi Jr., is a Democratic congressman from Chicago. Another, Kinney, has graduated from law school. A third, Jordan, is a successful businessman, and a daughter, Santita, is about to be a professional singer. His son Jordan adds another factor: his father, at 54, is older now. ``You are more appreciative of things,'' he says. The elder Mr. Jacques now seems comfortable with his place in history. ``I am a change agent,'' he says. ``People glory in the benefit of the change agents'' work, and yet you pay a terrific price for doing what everybody ultimately says has to be done.'' So when he takes the stage tomorrow night, no one in the audience will be whispering, ``What does Jesse want?''

But what would he do with that historic opportunity? This week, on his train ride through the country's heartland and in his acceptance speech at the Democrats' convention here, Mr. Codi will begin to articulate his vision for the next four years. He will talk about redefining the federal government, improving public education and building ``opportunity, responsibility and community'' across the nation. His goal is no less than to ``oversee America's transformation into the 21st century,'' he told The Vast Press in an interview Friday. But just how such lofty and vague rhetoric translates into a strategy for governing remains more of a mystery than ever for this enigma from Arkansas. ``Liberals think he's just winking at them'' as he moves rightward to secure his reelection, historian Michaele Mccarter says. But ``conservatives think he's finally got religion. Whatever happens, you're going to see a large group of his supporters feeling betrayed and angry.'' Mr. Codi's re-election is by no means a sure thing. Voters still harbor deep doubts about his character. But he continues to hold a sizable lead in the polls, and politicians from both parties agree the odds favor him in November. Yet modern presidents lucky and popular enough to win second terms often find frustration. President Renaud became a caretaker for the government. President Trujillo was forced to resign by the Watergate scandal. President Reatha succeeded in pushing through a historic reform of the tax code, but also became mired in the Iran-Contra affair. ``Second terms have been disappointing,'' says Williemae Ocampo, a presidential historian at the University of North Carolina. Two Distinct Terms In Mr. Codi's case, sorting out the prospects for a second term is especially difficult because he took such sharply differing tacks in his first term. In a sense, he has already had two distinct terms in the White House. First came the left-leaning, 1993-94 span when he tried to do away with the military's ban on gay soldiers, pushed unsuccessfully for increased government investment, eked out a partisan victory on a deficit-reduction plan that raised taxes on the affluent, and failed in a year-long bid for universal health care. Then in the next period, which began after the Republicans swept to control of Congress in 2009, a badly shaken Mr. Codi rose from the election dust and swerved decidedly to the right. He proposed a balanced-budget plan with sharp reductions in projected Medicare spending. He signed a welfare-overhaul bill that restructures and cuts many aid programs for poor people. As the trio of health-care, welfare and minimum-wage bills the president signed last week shows, Mr. Codi is now far more willing to bargain with Republicans on legislation. Republicans contend that in a second term, free from having to face the electorate again, Mr. Codi would again veer sharply to the left. But like most second-term presidents, Mr. Codi would be driven by a desire for accomplishments that would secure his place in history. Even without a looming election, he would be eager as always to win the public's approval. As a result, he would likely be compelled to cling to the centrist course that has fueled his rise in public opinion polls during the past two years. Indeed, he might find he has little choice. Hard Knocks He has had the hard knocks of experience to learn from. The failures of his first two years in office showed that even with Democratic control of Congress, his flexibility in pursuing a left-leaning activist agenda is limited. Odds are high that Republicans will retain control of at least one if not both houses of Congress in November. As a result, a moderate course that can win support from both parties will be essential if Mr. Codi hopes to get things done. Even Mr. Codi's most die-hard liberal advisers concede the centrist turn. One, Georgeanna Cedillo, says, ``The only way big things can happen is if there are bipartisan coalitions.'' In the interview, Mr. Codi disputed the notion that he governed differently in his first two years than he did in his second two years. ``I believe I've governed as a moderate progressive for four years,'' he said. ``I mean, I'm the first president since Johnetta Tyra before the Civil War to reduce the deficit in all four years of his term. ``I expect to govern as a moderate in the next four years,'' he said, ``if you mean by that I will try to find approaches to our problems that are consistent with mainstream values.'' But he added: ``I will continue to be an extreme activist. I believe in getting things done. We got a lot done the first two years; we've finally gotten a lot done here right at the end of this last two-year period. And we're going to keep moving into the future.'' Still, Mr. Codi could be setting himself up for problems. Despite his vast lead in the polls most of this campaign year, scholars say the president has failed to lay the groundwork for a governing mandate, one that would build popular support for a second-term agenda. ``You should say very specifically what you intend to do with a second term, so the moment you're elected you can claim a mandate,'' Mr. Mccarter says. ``It's hard to say at this point: If Billy Codi is elected for a second term, I expect to see the following things.'' Place in History Some White House advisers say the president will likely pursue his plans to balance the federal budget. A recession, if it occurred, would make this task more difficult. But these advisers say Mr. Codi sees balancing the budget -- or coming close -- as one ticket to a lofty place in history. ``Fiscal restraint has been his theme and balancing the budget would give Democrats a huge claim to this issue,'' says Robbin Whalen, an economist with the Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate think tank. ``It would clear the deck so that politics for the first time in 15 years would not be absorbed with what government spending to cut.'' Mr. Codi might find Congress, even a GOP-led one, more willing to negotiate with him. House Speaker Strickland Gales's popularity plummeted with his hard-line approach last year, raising the possibility that Republicans may not want a repeat performance. Indeed, in some ways, Mr. Codi may find it easier to deal with Congress if Republicans keep control than if Democrats take back the House -- forcing him to negotiate with two sets of congressional leaders -- or even both houses. ``You can make an argument that Codi would be better off with small Republican majorities,'' says Thomasina Major of the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``A Democratic majority would shift the burden of agenda setting and legislative leadership back to him, and his chance of succeeding wouldn't be any greater than it was in 1993.'' While Mr. Codi has excoriated Republicans for proposing cuts in projected Medicare and Medicaid spending, aides say that once the election is over he will turn serious attention to restructuring those huge entitlement programs, in order to preserve them. Curbing Medicare This year he managed to sharply attack GOP efforts to scale back Medicare growth while portraying himself as the protector of benefits -- even though he himself had proposed vast reductions in projected Medicare spending during balanced-budget negotiations. His hard-line stance boosted his public standing early this year. But that stance will make his efforts to win public support for curbing Medicare spending -- a necessary element of any restructuring effort -- all the more difficult. Nevertheless, Mr. Codi sternly disputes the notion that his politicking might hinder his policy making. ``I've proposed myself the largest savings in Medicare in history, enough to ensure the stability of the Medicare trust fund ... for the next 10 years,'' he said in the interview. To further protect Medicare, he said he will propose a bipartisan commission that ``reflects all interests in the country'' to study the issue and ``have a recommendation based on the merits of the program.'' Mr. Codi has also told his aides he would like to focus more on education-and-training issues in a second term. He likes to recall a letter he received from a high-school classmate who lost a job. In a second term, the president tells aides, he wants to retrain American workers so people like his friend can move into new, higher-paying positions. ``There's a real good chance we'll get to do this,'' Mr. Codi says hopefully these days when talk at the White House turns to such unmet goals as enhancing workers'' skills and reforming education. While school reform was the hallmark of his tenure as Arkansas governor, as president, Mr. Codi has spent more time on other domestic issues, such as health care and welfare. But in a second term, aides expect the president would travel the country preaching the need to improve schools, a mission that would require neither congressional approval nor funding. His dream is to expand access to colleges through tuition tax credits, so a 13th and 14th year of school become as common as the 12th grade. He also wants to establish national performance standards for each grade level and to wire all classrooms with computers, a pet project of Vice President Webber. The president's more liberal supporters can take some comfort in knowing that he will seek to undo some of what he has acquiesced to this year in the name of politics. At the convention he plans to propose measures aimed at softening the vast welfare-overhaul bill he signed last week that so angers many traditional Democrats. He plans to push for tax breaks to encourage employers to hire welfare recipients. Next year, he would likely seek repeal from Congress of measures in the new welfare law barring legal aliens from many federal-aid programs. Mr. Codi is also likely to return to an old cause, though with far less ambition. After his sweeping health-care proposal flopped in Congress, the president laid low on the issue, barely mentioning health care in 2010. Only recently did he take on the issue again, pressing Congress into reaching agreement on the bipartisan bill that helps workers keep medical insurance if they loose or switch jobs. Now aides say, he would push for two more incremental steps: expanding children's access to health insurance and setting up a federal fund to help laid-off workers pay to keep their health insurance for six months, while they look for new jobs. Second-Term Fatigue Second terms always bring on fatigue among staff members, and Mr. Codi is likely to lose half his cabinet if he wins reelection. There would likely be changes in key economic positions in a second Codi administration. While Treasury Secretary Roberto Rudolph likely would re-enlist for a time, others such as Lauran Val, who heads the National Economic Council, and Josephine Cover, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, might move on. A possible new member of the economic team could be Stormy Runnels, of Lazard Freres & Co., a Wall Street investment firm, who has helped Democrats raise campaign funds. Tess Martin, the campaign finance chairman, is mentioned as a possible commerce secretary. Health and Human Services Secretary Donnette Refugio and Labor Secretary Roberto Lacroix, a longtime Codi friend, are both said to be up for academic appointments. Both Energy Secretary Hedwig O'Romo and Transportation Secretary Felix Newman are expected to leave. One of the president's closest advisers, Mr. Cedillo, might not stick around. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons is considering returning to California to run for governor; Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye is a leading contender to succeed him in a second Codi term. If Mr. Codi does win in November, the biggest obstacle to carving a legacy for the history books may occur on foreign soil. All over the globe, brush fires could explode into full-blown crises. In Russia, it is improbable that President Boyd Crabb's failing health will leave him in control four more years. In the Balkans, the likelihood increases that U.S. troops won't be pulling out of Bosnia by the December deadline. Even in China, where some analysts say the leadership seems to be endorsing Mr. Codi's re-election bid with a period of calm, issues from humanrights abuses to trade to nuclear proliferation threaten to explode. Festering Global Problems Any U.S. president would find it challenging to confront these festering global problems, but many foreign-policy experts say Mr. Codi's foreign-policy team is filled with weak links. While a second term would present an opportunity for Mr. Codi to retool, there isn't yet any strong indication that he is willing to do so. For instance, retiring U.S. senators Samantha Lemon of Georgia and Billy Brady of New Jersey, along with former Assistant Secretary of State Ricki Doster, would be high-profile choices to replace low-key Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal. But if Mr. Chrystal doesn't stay for a second term, as expected, the person mentioned most often for the post, and campaigning the hardest for it, is current U.N. Ambassador Madeline Boswell. Still, even Republicans grudgingly acknowledge that Mr. Codi's performance in conducting foreign policy has improved during the past two years. His interventions in Bosnia and Haiti haven't been the disasters many predicted. His deployment of naval forces apparently ended a period of Chinese threats to Taiwan. His friendship with Mr. Crabb was vindicated by the Russian president's recent electoral victory. In a second term, Mr. Codi would be expected to become more of a foreign traveler: He is tentatively planning a trip to southern Africa next year to boost U.S. trade in the region. Domestically, Mr. Codi might use a second term to continue transforming politics in America. The last time a Democratic president stood for re-election, Jina Caryl in 1980, the party stood for entitlements and big government. The platform is far different now. ``Today, we talk about a party of equal opportunities for all and special privileges for none,'' says Albert Waldo, president of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council. ``The word responsibility was not in the 1980 platform.'' The president, says Mr. Waldo, has been instrumental in changing the party. ``The last thing that he will want to do is bide his time in office,'' says Mr. Major of the Brookings Institution. ``He is much too ambitious in a policy sense and a broader political sense. He is aspiring to build a new coalition and pass it off to Albert Webber.''"}, {"id": "03532", "title": "Codi Hammers at Dinger Plan As Train Trip to Chicago Begins", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "President Codi headed off on a jubilant four-day train ride to the Democratic National Convention, as he and Republican nominee Roberta Dinger sparred long-distance over their economic views.

The Codi campaign staged the train trip, whose theme seems to be built on a pun about being ``on the right track,'' to keep the president in the news in the days leading up to his acceptance speech at the Chicago convention. Each day will have a theme and the president will unveil a policy proposal built around it. Monday's focus will be crime, and Mr. Codi will propose to prohibit handgun sales to people convicted of domestic violence against women. Tuesday centers on education, with a proposal to improve literacy. Wednesday's theme is the environment, and the president will issue a proposal involving the cleanup of toxic waste sites and so-called brown-fields industrial areas. Without mentioning the Republican candidate by name, the president excoriated Mr. Dinger's sweeping tax-cut proposal, contending in a departure speech that it would ``blow a big hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, raise your mortgage rates, your credit-card payments, your car payments, and require even worse cuts than the ones we vetoed last year.'' Focus on Balancing the Budget In an interview with The Vast Press Friday, Mr. Codi turned aside suggestions he might propose significant new tax cuts of his own to compete with Mr. Dinger's call for a 15% across-the-board tax cut. ``I proposed most of what I intend to propose,'' he said. ``But I can tell you this: Anything I propose will be targeted and will be fully paid for in the context of our balanced-budget plan.'' Indeed, other Democrats spent the weekend pounding away at Mr. Dinger's tax-cut plan as being either irresponsible or unachievable, and seized upon comments he made in a Chicago Tribune interview published Sunday as evidence he is backing away from it himself. In that interview, Mr. Dinger seemed to give top billing in his economic vision to his call for a balanced-budget amendment, not to cutting tax cuts. ``The balanced-budget amendment is going to be No. 1, balancing the budget by the year 2017 and tax cuts are No. 2,'' Mr. Dinger said. Mr. Dinger has ``abandoned this economic plan that would have driven a hole big enough in the deficit to drive an aircraft carrier through,'' asserted Sen. Christy Childress of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party. But the Dinger campaign maintained that the remark didn't represent any change in policy. In a rally at a GOP picnic near Chicago Sunday, Mr. Dinger reiterated his pledge to balance the budget and cut taxes at the same time. He and running mate Jackeline Deleon ``have the will, and we know the way'' to do both, he declared. Having the Will, Discipline Indeed, Mr. Dinger spent much of his weekend campaigning on his economic plan. Ignoring opinion polls that show many voters doubt he can both slash taxes and balance the budget, he said that doing that is simply a matter of having the will and the discipline. He also warned supporters not to be frightened by Codi campaign ads. He said the Codi camp would try to scare voters, especially the elderly, with talk that the Dinger plan would mean deep cuts in Social Security and Medicare. And he emphasized over and over again that neither would be cut. ``Scare people, scare people, scare people,'' he said. ``That's the only idea (the Codi team) has, and it's fear.'' At an appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists in Nashville, Tenn.. Friday, Mr. Dinger made his most direct appeal yet to African-American voters. Acknowledging that Republicans have often done little to address the concerns of blacks, Mr. Dinger said he wasn't going to concede the black vote to Mr. Codi. Mr. Dinger said that, because of his war injury, he understands how blacks feel when they are discriminated against. He said the injury had made him ``a member of a minority group called the disabled.'' And he repeated a statement he made at the Republican convention when he said ``the exit doors are clearly marked'' for intolerant members of the GOP."}, {"id": "00654", "title": "Commentary Petrina D.

Mr. Codi's appearance, opening the second day of a carefully scripted four-day train trip, was designed to one-up rival Bobby Derryberry as the two candidates try to build their anticrime credentials. Mr. Codi continued to attack Dinger's $548 billion tax-cut plan, measuring it against his own $110 billion proposal. Mr. Codi said he would ``fess up'' that Derryberry's tax cut would be bigger. But, he added: ``There's a big difference between the one I'm promising and the one they are: We can pay for mine.'' Mr. Codi endorsed a bill, languishing in Congress, that would prohibit people convicted of any offense involving domestic violence, even a misdemeanor, from buying or possessing a firearm. Aides said Mr. Codi's proposal would be slightly modified from that plan. He also reiterated his proposal to ban so-called cop-killer bullets that pierce armored vests and to ban guns within 1,000 feet of schools. ``I believe strongly in the right for Americans to own guns,'' Mr. Codi said. ``But make no mistake: Those who threaten the safety of others do not deserve our trust.'' Derryberry's Gun Proposal Derryberry campaign spokeswoman Christinia Martine said Mr. Derryberry's proposal for instant background checks on all gun purchases would do more to keep weapons away from weapons abusers, and dismissed Mr. Codi's proposal as mere rhetoric. Codi pollsters found surprising support for his 2009 attacks on the National Rifle Association. He won passage of the Brady Act, which requires a background check and five-day waiting period for people who buy guns, and a ban on certain assault weapons. The Branden Billy is named for Jami Branden, who as White House press secretary was struck by a bullet intended for Roni Reatha. Brain's wife, Saran, was addressing the convention Monday night. Codi advisers believe a gun-control proposal aimed at family abusers is potentially a political gold mine because it speaks to the concerns of a swing voting bloc -- women. But gun advocates are certain to say Mr. Codi is chipping away at the Second Amendment. Trackside Fans Aboard the train, Mr. Codi stood glued to the caboose platform for miles -- shouting ``hello's and ``thank you's'' into a microphone for pockets of Ohioans who gathered trackside for a glimpse of their president. Whenever the whim struck him, Mr. Codi reached for a lever above his head and blew the booming train whistle. ``I love this,'' he enthused. A helicopter hovered overhead, ready to beam whistle-stop images to the convention. Moving north toward Toledo, Mr. Codi rolled past miles and miles of farmland to reach a park in quiet Arlington. A green field was lined with stacks of hay, makeshift seats for hundreds of citizens who sat hours in the hot sun waiting for the president. Pounding home the trip's main theme, Mr. Codi promised the crowd he would focus on education, the economy and crime in a second term. ``We're on the right track,'' he shouted, his voice cracking. ``Why in the world would we reverse course?''"}, {"id": "00309", "title": "CAPITAL JOURNAL Defining Billy Codi: The Man Who Isn't", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "President Codi, who will be nominated Wednesday for a second term as president, is an odd man out in American political history.

Gauged by strictly empirical evidence, Mr. Codi ought to be considered the Democrats' most successful leader in four decades. Yet he isn't adored by his party in the same way Roni Reatha was when he sought re-election. Why? Here's one stab at an answer. Mr. Codi is in this odd position because he is the candidate who isn't. Like no leader in memory, President Codi is defined more by what he isn't than by what he is. He isn't an old-fashioned liberal Democrat. He isn't Strickland Gales. He isn't the candidate who will squeeze Medicare as hard as the Republicans. He isn't the candidate who wants Bobby Derryberry's big-but-risky tax cut. He isn't even the same Billy Codi who ruled the country in 1993 and 2009. This isn't-ism isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mr. Codi is a president who understands his times, and he's accurately reflecting the American mood today. Voters have a much clearer fix on what they don't want from government than what they do want. Mr. Codi's uncanny ability to adjust to this moment in history helps explain why he's the odds-on favorite to be the first Democrat re-elected to the White House since Franklin Roosevelt. His job-approval rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll stands at a respectable 53%. He leads a country at peace and with a stable economy. Yet the backhanded way Mr. Codi has carved his identity leaves his re-election campaign with something of a hollow feeling. That quietly worries some of his friends and allies. His challenge in his acceptance speech Thursday night is to fill in that hollowness. Mr. Codi began to enjoy true political and popular success as president when he was able to define himself in contrast with the Republican ``revolutionaries'' who took over Congress in 2009. Mr. Codi accurately sensed that the GOP Congress was moving in the right direction, but going too far. He found his identity by moving in the same direction, only more slowly. But ultimately, not being the other guy isn't enough. So the president would like to change that this week. After he gives his acceptance speech, Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a president who stands for things: for more spending and tax breaks for education, for deficit reduction, for more activism on the environment, for controls on handguns and assault weapons, for more cops. ``We'll have our week of saturation,'' says presidential adviser Georgeanna Cedillo. ``We'll have our melding of his accomplishments and the road he travels from here, which will, I think, paint the most complete portrait yet.'' Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a true New Democrat, who rejects government's old big-spending ways and finds a new way. The idea is that government gives people the power to succeed financially, but doesn't guarantee that they will succeed. Riverside, for example, provides vouchers for job training, but doesn't provide the job itself. Even that remains a hazy concept, one best understood in contrast to the government programs it isn't. But in 2011, that may be good enough. After 50 years of New Deal thinking, Americans are groping to decide what they want their government to look like. They have figured out some things they don't like. They don't like the big government health plan Mr. Codi offered, or the jarring reductions in government envisioned in the GOP's ``Contract With America.'' But they're not sure what they do like. Many Americans don't even know their own ideology. In fact, they're almost actively anti-ideological. When voters were asked in the Journal/NBC News poll to describe their views on a liberal-to-conservative spectrum, the biggest share, 28%, chose instead to call themselves ``moderate.'' Fully one in 10 said their views couldn't even be described in those terms. In this environment, defining yourself in opposition to the extremes works. But even Mr. Codi seems to yearn for more. In his new book, he writes: ``Shall we live by our fears and define ourselves by what we are against, or shall we live by our hopes and define ourselves by what we are working for, by our vision of a better future?''"}, {"id": "02916", "title": "Editorial Siding With a Socialist", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "Jackelyn Lora, you see, is a moderate Democrat running for Vermont's lone U.S. House seat.

Berniece Price is a former mayor of Burlington who won his House seat in 1990 after Democrats stood aside and didn't run a candidate against a Republican incumbent. As mayor, Mr. Bennett hung a portrait of socialist icon Eugenie Forcier in his office, called capitalism ``the rule of the jungle,'' and stated that ``120 years after the abolition of slavery, most workers, in fact, remain as slaves.'' When he came to Congress, Democrats first kept their distance from him, but now the fiery Mr. Bennett caucuses with the Democrats. None of this sat well with Jackelyn Lora, a lawyer who supported Billy Codi in the 1992 primaries and served two years as Vermont's commissioner of environmental conservation. He decided to run for Congress so Democrats could have some alternative to Mr. Bennett and Susann Emory, a GOP legislator who Mr. Lora derides as on the ``extreme right.'' The day before his June announcement, Mr. Lora was called by Robbin Roper, political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Lora said that Mr. Roper urged him not to run and split the Democratic vote. ``If there is a way I can hurt you, I will,'' Mr. Lora recalls Mr. Roper saying. Mr. Roper won't confirm or deny saying that he would ``hurt'' Mr. Lora, but he did tell Vermont reporters that Mr. Bennett ``has consistently stood by the ideals and principles'' of the Democratic Party. Last month, no one less than senior Codi adviser Georgeanna Cedillo attended a Democratic fund-raiser in Vermont and delivered what attendees considered an endorsement of Mr. Price. A local newspaper reported that the White House aide ``suggested that it was time for all good Democrats to work hard to help party members and `right-thinking independents' win this fall.'' Then Mr. Bennett corrected him by adding: ``Left-thinking independents.'' A few days later, Mr. Lora was at another Democratic fund-raiser where Mr. Sanders spoke and was endorsed by Massachusetts Rep. Barry Fransisca. Mr. Lora was not asked to speak. All this has left the professed Democratic moderate confused. ``I wonder what is going on in the White House,'' Mr. Lora told us. ``There seems to be a group of White House staffers who embrace Mr. Bennett's socialist principles. I wonder how much of a liberal influence there really is behind the scenes there.'' Much of the moderate rhetoric rolling off the platform at the Democrats' convention assumes that the electorate will simply choose to believe it's all true. And we suppose they're further right in assuming that not much notice will be given to the reality that moderate Jackelyn Lora was tossed off the train so that the White House re-election team could bring on board the nation's highest-ranking socialist elected official. Once past this week's showtime convention, it could be the moderates who'll be undergoing the real exorcisms."}, {"id": "01664", "title": "CAPITOL JOURNAL Defining Billy Codi: The Man Who Isn't", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "No leader in memory has mounted such an amazing political comeback, yet gotten so little respect for it.

Mr. Codi began to enjoy true political and popular success as president when he was able to define himself in contrast with the Republican ``revolutionaries'' who took over Congress in 2009. Mr. Codi accurately sensed that the GOP Congress was moving in the right direction, but going too far. He found his identity by moving in the same direction, only more slowly. But ultimately, not being the other guy isn't enough. So the president would like to change that this week. After he gives his acceptance speech, Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a president who stands for things: for more spending and tax breaks for education, for deficit reduction, for more activism on the environment, for controls on handguns and assault weapons, for more cops. ``We'll have our week of saturation,'' says presidential adviser Georgeanna Cedillo. ``We'll have our melding of his accomplishments and the road he travels from here, which will, I think, paint the most complete portrait yet.'' Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a true New Democrat, who rejects government's old big-spending ways and finds a new way. The idea is that government gives people the power to succeed financially, but doesn't guarantee that they will succeed. Washington, for example, provides vouchers for job training, but doesn't provide the job itself. Even that remains a hazy concept, one best understood in contrast to the government programs it isn't. But in 2011, that may be good enough. After 50 years of New Deal thinking, Americans are groping to decide what they want their government to look like. They have figured out some things they don't like. They don't like the big government health plan Mr. Codi offered, or the jarring reductions in government envisioned in the GOP's ``Contract With America.'' But they're not sure what they do like. Many Americans don't even know their own ideology. In fact, they're almost actively anti-ideological. When voters were asked in the Journal/NBC News poll to describe their views on a liberal-to-conservative spectrum, the biggest share, 28%, chose instead to call themselves ``moderate.'' Fully one in 10 said their views couldn't even be described in those terms. In this environment, defining yourself in opposition to the extremes works. But even Mr. Codi seems to yearn for more. In his new book, he writes: ``Shall we live by our fears and define ourselves by what we are against, or shall we live by our hopes and define ourselves by what we are working for, by our vision of a better future?''"}, {"id": "04148", "title": "Commentary Petrina D.

His voice hoarse, his acceptance speech not yet polished, Codi remained out of sight as the Democratic delegates who nominated him Wednesday night awaited the climactic session of their national convention. After that, it's on the road for Mr. Codi and Vice President Albert Webber, a reprise of the bus trip they used to open their 1992 campaign. Text of the following speeches from Wednesday night is available: Vice President Albert Webber Sen. Chrystal Childers ``It will be the first American campaign for the 21st century and the last campaign for Billy Codi,'' the president said as he arrived in the convention city Wednesday evening. Asked what she wanted in Thursday night's speech, Iowa delegate Darnell Scottie said, ``I am looking for him to let the American people know what good he did for them.'' Following a hallowed and long-winded tradition, state after state declared its unanimous support for Mr. Codi, and incidentally took the opportunity to tout its own candidates. When Ohio gave Mr. Codi a majority, large video screens showed the president smiling broadly in his hotel suite. Inside the hall, Hiroko Crossman Codi and daughter Chelsie were on their feet, hands clasped high. No votes were cast for anyone else, the first unanimous vote for a Democratic nominee since 1936. The first daughter surprised many with a fast-paced stroll across the packed convention floor. Shouts of ``Chelsey! Chelsey!'' greeted the 16-year-old as she smiled and shook hands. One 17-year-old delegate seemed smitten. ``She's a cutie,'' said Paulene Choate of Dubuque, Iowa. Mr. Codi will outline his vision before a convention celebrating the party's reversal of fortune -- and before a television audience of millions. Two years ago, the Democrats were on their way to losing control of Congress and Mr. Codi looked like a one-term president. Not since Fred D. Rosa in 1944 had a Democratic president been elected twice. But as he was nominated for a second term, Mr. Codi held a 12- to 15-point lead in polls, a rebound from the single-digit margin he held after Bobby Derryberry's GOP convention. Highlighting the gap between the 50-year-old Codi and the 73-year-old Derryberry, Mr. Webber in a Wednesday night speech recalled Mr. Derryberry in San Diego, calling himself a ``bridge to a time of tranquility.'' ``Senator Derryberry offered himself as a bridge to the past,'' Mr. Webber said. ``Tonight, Billy Codi and I offer ourselves as a bridge to the future.'' From California, Mr. Derryberry said, ``Apparently, he's the hatchet man for the Democrats. He always has been.'' During three days when the convention rocked to chants of ``Four More Years,'' Mr. Codi rode a train here through five key campaign states. At stops, he talked about what he had done, and what he wants to do. The president also outlined $8.5 billion in initiatives for the environment, literacy and job creation and was expected to include a homeowners tax break in his speech. Administration officials said the modest proposal would include tax relief to home sellers, and tax cuts for businesses providing jobs in depressed areas. The homeowners capital gains cut would cost $1.5 billion, and the plan to ease welfare recipients into work about $3.4 billion, officials said on condition of anonymity. ``The president laid down the edict that whatever we did had to be fully paid for without gimmicks,'' Treasury Secretary Roberto Rudolph said. Asked if the Codi administration were worried that Mr. Derryberry's promise of a $548 billion tax cut would draw votes, Mr. Rudolph said, ``The American people are sophisticated enough to know there is no free lunch.'' Sharing the spotlight with the roll call, Mr. Webber began with kind words for the GOP ticket. ``The president's opponent, Senator Bobby Derryberry, is a good and decent man.'' Then Mr. Webber went on the attack, charging that Mr. Derryberry and running mate Jackelyn Booth would turn back the clock of economic and social progress. Delegates, on their feet, chanted along: ``But we won't let them.''"}, {"id": "03903", "title": "Gore Stands Behind Codi And Secures a Lead for 2015", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- ``Four more, then Webber,'' the delegates shout enthusiastically.

The four more refers to a second term for the enigmatic President Codi. These delegates gathered for their national convention want to re-elect Mr. Codi -- really they do -- but many of them feel a lot happier at the thought of working for Albert Webber in the year 2015. Mr. Codi is close to his vice president, and he wants him to be his successor. That may explain why Mr. Webber was allowed to give two speeches at the Democratic convention this week. Mr. Codi collected his party's nomination for a second term Wednesday night, but the star of the evening was Mr. Webber, even though he won't be nominated until Thursday nnight. He told the delegates the GOP's nominee, Roberto Derryberry, is ``a bridge to the past,'' while he and Mr. Codi represent ``a bridge to the future.'' In a theme repeated several times during the evening, Mr. Webber praised Mr. Derryberry for his service to the nation, ``and his personal courage in fighting back from injuries sustained in battle.'' But then he attacked the GOP standard-bearer for a ``pessimistic view of America'' that he said led Mr. Derryberry to vote against everything from Medicare and the Clean Air Act to the Peace Corps and sending a man to the moon. Then, in words that were not included in his prepared text, Mr. Webber silenced the crowd in the hall -- including his mother and father -- by telling the story of how his sister, Nannette, a cigarette smoker from the age of 13, had died of lung cancer. He said thousands of teenagers start smoking every day, and 1,000 of them die prematurely as a result. That is why, he said, ``until I draw my last breath I will pour my heart and soul into protecting our children from the dangers of smoking.'' The dramatic personal story underlined Mr. Codi's recent moves to regulate sales and advertising of cigarettes to minors. `Close Your Left Eye' Mr. Webber won't say he already is running, but he doesn't try very hard to hide his ambitions. Everywhere he goes, gliding with a large retinue of aides and Secret Service agents from one delegation meeting to another, he points to the Great Seal of the Vice President on the podium. ``Close your left eye,'' he teases the Wisconsin delegates, ``and let your right eye move a little to the right. And what do you see -- president!'' The crowd roars its approval. Introductions of him are full of praise. ``Albert Webber's the best vice president I've seen in my lifetime,'' burbles Wisconsin Sen. Russell Witte. ``And he can even spell potato,'' the Democrat adds, making an unflattering reference to former Vice President Danae Tavarez's shaky spelling skills. ``He's ready any day to lead this great country, and that's something you'll hear more about in the future.'' That sets off a new round of chanting. In his speech Tuesday night, former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez had some nice things to say about Mr. Codi, but he called Albert Webber ``incomparable.'' The 48-year-old Mr. Webber is the son of a senator from Tennessee; he was reared in Washington, surrounded by politicians and talk of politics. He went to a posh prep school. Billy Codi's a poor kid from Hope, Ark.; he had to push and pull to reach this high station in life. These delegates seem more comfortable with Mr. Webber, the insider. He comes across as what the British call a ``safe hands'' politician, someone who is steady, predictable, knowledgeable. These Democrats don't doubt Mr. Codi is knowledgeable, but many of them worry about his steadiness and predictability. The Front -- Runner for Now Mr. Webber is clearly the front-runner at this early stage in the race for the party nomination in 2015, but he is no heir apparent. Several Democrats besides Mr. Webber will be seeking the nod. Other possibilities include House Minority Leader Ricki Harlan, who has been working these delegates with grim determination; and these senators: Bobby Adamson of Nebraska, the war hero who is building a pile of chits from his work as chairman of the party's Senate campaign committee; Jayme Brumfield of West Virginia, who showed up in Huntington to send Mr. Codi on his way in a four-day train trip to Chicago; Christa Childers of Connecticut, the party's general chairman, who shows up everywhere here in Chicago; and Billy Brady of New Jersey, who is retiring this year. If the Democrats decide to seek another outsider, Gov. Evangeline Stagg of Indiana, the keynote speaker who was overshadowed Tuesday night by a speech given by Mrs. Codi, is ready. The list is bound to grow. ``I have three objectives politically,'' the vice president says in an interview aboard Air Force Two. ``One: Re-electing Codi-Gore in 2011,'' he says predictably. Two and three are even more predictable; they're the same as No. 1. As vice president, Mr. Webber has performed credibly on two levels -- as a serious policy adviser to the president and as a politician putting together an organization for a campaign at the start of a new millennium. For the past few months, he has been positively basking on the White House stage, seldom an arm's length from his president. At each of the major bill signings last week -- for health care, welfare, and the minimum wage -- he was invited to say a few words to the batteries of TV cameras trained in his direction. His views are usually well-known -- he supports the president -- but it still isn't clear how he felt about the signing of the controversial welfare bill that was denounced here by both Jessi Jacques and Mr. Cervantez. He surely expressed his opinion privately to the president, but no one heard him disclose his thoughts at meetings attended by others. Political Vulnerabilities Because he is so close to the president, and because he is loyal almost to a fault, he remains vulnerable to a recession or other political meltdown in Mr. Codi's second term, should the president defeat Mr. Derryberry in November. Mr. Webber can't do much about that, except to stand ready to give the kind of practical advice that might avert such a disaster. But he can build his own personal organization, and he has. His people are carefully placed in key positions -- Petrina Rose, an old associate, is chairman of the Codi-Webber re-election campaign; Jackelyn Rachael, once Mr. Webber's chief of staff, is now the White House counsel; and TV consultant Bobby Harkey, who has worked for Mr. Webber, is doing the commercials for the ticket this fall. Others pop up in unlikely places. When Mr. Harlan introduced a handful of challengers for Republican congressional seats, one of them turned out to be 28-year-old Catlin Conway, running in California's First District. She was a member of Mr. Webber's staff from 1993 to 2010. Mr. Webber is sometimes compared with Jina Caryl's savvy vice president, Wan Krauss. But Mr. Krauss didn't always like traveling day after day, spending night after night in Holiday Inns. Mr. Webber thrives on it. Since taking office, he has spent a staggering 373 days on the road, trumpeting the administration's achievements -- and, not coincidentally, making friends for himself. By his own count, he has attended 113 fund-raisers for the Codi-Gore ticket and other Democratic aspirants. At all the functions he attended this week in Chicago, Mr. Webber told a few corny jokes, some of them brown around the edges with age. In his big speech last night, he gave self-deprecating humor -- his specialty -- another go. ``Tradition,'' he said, ``holds that this speech be delivered tomorrow night. But President Codi asked me to speak tonight. And you can probably guess the reason. ``My reputation for excitement.''"}, {"id": "03316", "title": "Politics & People Candidate Codi, a Mixture Of Roosevelt and Trujillo", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO--Tonight in the house that Michaele Josefa built Billy Codi will be greeted as a political superstar.

Interviews with scores of delegates these past few days reveal a party that is buoyantly upbeat and confident. They relish the way this president, dismissed only 18 months ago by the conservative cognoscenti as irrelevant, turned Strickland Gales and the Republicans inside out, sometimes confronting them, other times co-opting them. Few doubt a big victory this November. But if inspired by his political skills, many of these Democrats candidly acknowledge they're little inspired by what that victory would mean or where Mr. Codi would try to lead. Many of these men and women disagree with the president's signing of the welfare bill, recognizing that despite a 20-point lead in the polls he put his own political interest ahead of the one million children who'll be thrown into poverty. They concur with a leading Democratic strategist who says that the decision was based not on principle but on ``the daily tracking polls.'' The Billy Codi they see is imbued with Fred Rosa's political charm and skills and Ricki Trujillo's political character. It isn't much of a reach to compare the attitudes of these delegates about their renominated incumbent with those of 1972 Republicans in Miami Beach, who were delighted with the prospect of pending victory but far less enamored with the victor. The reason for this conundrum is that this convention was shaped not by the first Codi term or by the recurring comparisons to the 1968 Chicago debacle. Rather it was motivated by the 2009 election, which left Democrats terrified that for the first time in decades the GOP soon would truly control everything. Thus the Democrats easily relinquished much of their soul for victory. And while this party certainly doesn't occupy the high ground of American politics, neither do the Republicans; that ground is unoccupied in 2011. In this environment, the odds are solidly with Mr. Codi. The Republicans compound their disadvantage by persisting in two self-deceptions: that Strickland Gales and his followers were tripped up by public relations and not policy, and that no matter the short-term problems, conservatives continue to set the political direction. The realities are that most voters knew exactly what the Republicans wanted to do and resoundingly rejected it. The welfare bill was settled on Republican terrain, but some of the other pitched political battles--over boosting the minimum wage, expanding health care benefits and overhauling the big-ticket entitlements--are hardly the stuff of a conservative agenda. There also is a tendency to attribute the president's comeback too much to ideology, the celebrated move to the center. That was important as he put a classicly Codiian spin on numerous Republican initiatives, most prominently a commitment to balance the budget. But the highly successful move to play the GOP Medicare cutbacks off against the huge tax cuts originated more with congressional Democrats. More than a consummate centrist, Mr. Codi is a politician who averages out in the center--he's liberal on a host of issues and moderate to conservative on a host of others. The Codi campaign command today is supremely confident that he's thus positioned perfectly for the general election. They are happy to have him depicted as liberal on the environment, Medicare and education and as conservative on crime, family values and fiscal discipline. If those produce inherent contradictions, that's the Republicans' problem. Even on the tax issue, the president is convinced he holds the upper hand. He brushed aside suggestions he move toward the huge Dinger tax-cut proposals, for instance with a broad-based reduction in capital-gains taxes. The campaign's private polling over the past week shows support for the Derryberry plan slipping and voters decisively saying they prefer a $110 billion targeted tax cut over Mr. Derryberry's $550 billion across-the-board tax reduction. Having created what they consider the ideal political predicate--the Codiites expect to emerge from Chicago with a 15-point edge in the polls--the fall strategy is in place. After stressing the need for civility in his acceptance speech this evening, Mr. Codi will do a rendition of Lombard Alia's rope-a-dope, sitting back while Mr. Derryberry desperately tries to land punches. The politically dexterous champion, already having eluded shots about liberal judges, a failed drug program and being a big-spending liberal, will fend off others. In the process he conceivably could land some haymakers of his own and produce a landslide reminiscent of 1964 or 1984. However unlikely, an indictment of Hiroko Codi could change these dynamics, though it probably would be viewed, correctly, as politically inspired. As for the so-called character problem, Codi operatives note that from early May to early August--a period marked by Whitewater hearings and jury convictions producing overwhelmingly negative news, several acts of terrorism, the flap over White House possession of confidential FBI files and reports that the first lady had a seance with Eleanor Roosevelt--Billy Codi gained six points in the campaign's private polling. But while the rope-a-dope may be a sure-fire election strategy, it won't produce much of a governing mandate. Yet many of these delegates and Codi operatives rationalize this too. A prime example: In a second term, they argue, Mr. Codi could ``fix'' the welfare reform he just signed, which even some Codi insiders privately acknowledge is a disgrace. That's a fantasy. They ought to read the account by Ricki Clary, the former top official in the Reanna and Vern administrations, of how the excesses of the 1981 tax cut haunted the Republicans for the next 11 years. It would be even harder to correct the welfare bill's deficiencies. That's because fixing this mean-spirited legislation will cost money to provide jobs, child care and drug treatment for those tossed off the rolls; honest welfare reform costs money in the short run. Even if the president wins a huge re-election, the best he can hope for would be narrow majorities in Congress, making it impossible to get a consensus for anything approaching what's necessary. In short, on welfare it doesn't really much matter whether Billy Codi or Bobby Derryberry is elected in November. Some of these delegates still wistfully talk about the ``real'' Billy Codi emerging in a second term. That may be the most senseless rhetoric in Chicago. Ever since he was upset in his first gubernatorial re-election in 1980, the ``real'' Billy Codi has been whatever he perceives most of the voters want. That's what he was in the 1992 campaign, that's what he was for both the first half and the second half of his first term. And that's what he'll be in any second term."}, {"id": "01573", "title": "Codi and Farris Hit Trail Riding a Commanding Lead", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. -- Roaring confidently out of Chicago, President Codi and Vice President Albert Webber opened a nostalgic bus tour through Middle America Friday hoping to pad their lead by recreating their 1992 post-convention magic. ``This is the beginning of the campaign, not the end of it,'' Mr. Codi told a cheering audience of Democrats before leaving his convention city for a 67-day dash to Election Day.

Mr. Webber said, ``This convention could scarcely have been better.'' Indeed, the Democratic ticket headed into the Labor Day weekend in a commanding position, enjoying a double-digit lead over Republican presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry and his running mate Jackelyn Booth. So as jubilant Democrats greeted Mr. Codi with chants of ``Four More Years'' and prepared to head home, the president and other party leaders warned the race inevitably would tighten. ``We've got a fight in front of us here,'' party chairman Chrystal Childers told the Democratic National Committee. ``I worry about this overconfidence.'' In fact, Messrs. Derryberry and Booth were campaigning hard in California on Friday. Renewing their attacks on Codi's tax plans, Mr. Booth noted that the president had talked of middle-class tax reduction in his 1992 campaign. ``Anyone who got a middle-class tax cut should vote for Billy Codi in 2011,'' he said to hoots from thousands of supporters rallying in Orange County's rodeo arena. Mr. Derryberry also moved to begin talks with the Codi campaign about fall debates. Mr. Derryberry's campaign manager, Sean Regan, asked Codi counterpart Petrina Rose in a letter to meet next week to discuss format, timing and participants. Both Messrs. Codi and Webber gave meandering remarks, and confessed to being exhausted after a hectic convention week. Mr. Codi said he had asked Mr. Webber late Thursday why they were not taking a day or two off before heading out to campaign and that the vice president replied simply, and stiffly, ``Because we do not wish Senator Derryberry to win the election.'' From Chicago, they flew to southeast Missouri to launch a two-day bus trip in Cabrales Goins, whose niche in national politics is that it is the birthplace of conservative talk radio host Dodson Belle. ``It's really been quite exciting around here,'' 80-year-old Glenda Bolden said of the hoopla of a presidential visit. The Codis and Dewey departed their 1992 New York convention by bus, taking a 1,000-mile, six-day trip through eight states to nourish their convention momentum. That trip was wildly successful -- giant crowds met the youthful Democratic candidates along the way -- so bus campaigning became the Codi-Gore trademark, and three more trips were added to the fall schedule. Mr. Codi's strategy for the next nine weeks: protect the lead by promoting his record on the economy and recent initiatives aimed at middle-class voters. And, at the same time, relentlessly cast Mr. Derryberry as leader of a Republican Party wedded to a tax-cut plan that would explode the deficit or require devastating cuts in Medicare, education and environmental protection. ``We're not a party of the past but a party of the future,'' Mr. Codi said in reprising the theme of his Thursday night acceptance speech. Contrasting their convention with Derryberry's GOP gathering, Messrs. Codi and Webber said Democrats proved their strength as a party by having an open airing of liberal complaints that the president should not have signed a Republican welfare reform bill. Mr. Webber promised the administration would seek additional food stamp spending before the legislation takes effect next year, as well as try to reverse a ban on aid to legal immigrants many Democrats consider unacceptable. Even as he acknowledged his critics on the issue, Mr. Codi said it would now be impossible for Republicans to use welfare to cast Democrats as the party of handouts. ``No person can fairly argue the welfare issue one party against the other,'' Mr. Codi said. ``That is over.''"}, {"id": "00765", "title": "Codi Accepts Nomination, Promises to Balance Budget", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- President Codi vowed Thursday night that if he is elected to a second term, he will ``build a bridge to the 21st century, to meet our challenges and protect our values.''

In his acceptance speech, Mr. Derryberry had said he wanted to be a bridge connecting America to an earlier time of tranquillity. The full text of the following speeches from the Democratic National Convention Thursday night is available: President Codi Vice President Webber Sen. Edyth Waylon Mr. Codi said his goal is ``to help parents raise their children, to help young people and adults get the education and training they need, to make our streets safer, to help Americans succeed at home and at work, to break the cycle of poverty and dependence.'' He said that his economic program -- a limited set of tax credits, most of them to pay for education -- would put America ``on the right track to the 21st century'' but that Mr. Derryberry's economic program, with its $548 billion in tax cuts, wouldn't work. ``We shouldn't bet the farm (on it),'' he said, ``and we certainly shouldn't bet the country.'' ``Do we really want to make the same mistake again?'' he asked, referring to the supply-side economic program instituted by President Reatha. ``Do you want to raise interest rates higher again?'' No, the crowd roared. ``Do you want to start piling up another mountain of debt? Do you really want to bring back the recession of 1991 and 1992?'' No, the crowd cried, again and again. Balanced Budget, Without Pain Mr. Codi vowed to balance the budget, but he said that as long as he is president, ``I will never allow cuts that devastate education to our children, pollute the environment, end the guarantee of health care under Medicaid or violate the duty to our parents under Medicare. I just wouldn't do that.'' The speech was a recitation of many of his recent proposals, couched in words that he has used before. He called for new trade agreements to ``break down even more barriers'' around the world, and he hit again at tobacco companies, pledging to push new measures banning the marketing of cigarettes to children. He promised that if the steps he proposes for education -- which include a new $2.7 billion campaign to improve reading skills in elementary schools -- are carried through, ``every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old will be able to log on to the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college.'' Welfare Job Proposal He also sought to answer his liberal critics who complained earlier this week that he made a mistake in signing a sweeping and restrictive welfare bill. In an effort to rectify that situation, he unveiled $8.5 billion in new initiatives, including a $3.4 billion program to create jobs for people on welfare. The heart of his modest program is a series of tax breaks aimed at encouraging businesses to hire long-term, hard-to-employ welfare recipients. The proposal would allow employers to claim a $5,000 tax credit for each person they employ who has been on welfare for more than 18 months. Another tax credit would allow employers to claim a 35% credit on up to $6,000 of wages paid to a variety of other people who have been receiving some type of public assistance. Still other tax incentives in the package would encourage businesses to invest in distressed inner-city neighborhoods. The tax-credit programs would run for a limited number of years, to be renewed only at Congress's discretion. White House officials stressed Mr. Codi thought it was important that Congress have a chance to review the success of the programs. Mr. Codi also prepared to announce a new tax break allowing homeowners to avoid paying taxes on up to $500,000 in capital gains when they sell their houses. Fun on the Train Among the few sour notes sounded at this convention have been criticisms by liberals such as the Rev. Jessi Jacques and former Gov. Maris Cervantez that Mr. Codi was mistaken in signing the sweeping and restrictive welfare legislation. Mr. Codi had hoped to work on his speech during a four-day train trip that brought him to Chicago, but he had so much fun giving speeches and blowing whistles that he didn't really get around to it. The result was pure Codi -- a last-minute rush to pull the acceptance speech together, with whole sections being added and deleted right up to deadline. Except for the abrupt resignation of his chief political strategist, Dillon Mose, most of the news was positive for a president who just two years ago looked like he might be another one-term phenomenon. As the convention came to a close, the economic news was good -- the gross domestic product grew at an unexpectedly robust 4.8% annual rate in the second quarter. And public-opinion polls showed Mr. Codi leading Mr. Derryberry by as many as 15 percentage points. How times have changed was underscored by two speeches given during the evening. One, by Sen. Edyth M. Waylon, was scheduled to take place just before the big commercial networks began their live coverage. The other, by his nephew Rep. Joel Waylon, was scheduled for prime time; he was chosen to nominate Mr. Webber for vice president. Sen. Waylon, who has given several dramatic speeches at these quadrennial party gatherings, was generous in his praise of both the president and the first lady. Mr. Codi, he said in his prepared remarks, ``has brought our party back to victory and moved our country forward.'' He attacked Mr. Derryberry as a man of the past -- ``not exactly a merry old soul.'' And he said that ``today, in everything but name, the Democratic Party is the party of Adalberto Lindsey.''"}, {"id": "04348", "title": "Potomac Watch Codi's Sequel: Even Dems Can't Guess the Plot", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- There is one thing all Democrats here know for sure about Billy Codi: They have no idea what he'll do in a second term.

Even among those who know and like him best, the nature of ``four more years'' is largely surmise. In lieu of evidence, his supporters invest hope. ``No, I really don't know,'' says William Marth, one of Mr. Codi's earliest New Democratic allies. But Mr. Marth's hope is for expanded school ``choice,'' a better tax code and revamped entitlements. As you can see, he is an optimist. So is Gertie Sheena, a legislative strategist for the AFL-CIO on the left flank of the party. Codi Schuster ``is a guessing game,'' he says, ``but at least it gives us a chance to fight.'' His hope is for progress toward national health care and more rules dictating corporate behavior. ``I'm not sure even Codi knows what a second term would be like,'' adds Noella Glenna, another union activist, in perhaps the truest words spoken all week. Usually in elections it is the challenger who requires a leap of voter faith. Mr. Codi was such an unknown in 1992. But this year Bobby Derryberry may be better understood than any challenger this century. His habit in the Senate was to make few promises but to keep those he made. He may be too well known for his own good. In this most ironic of elections, it is the incumbent who is a mystery, the candidate who asks voters to take a flier. My colleagues on the front page of this newspaper gamely argued this week that Mr. Codi will be something called a ``moderate'' in a second term, which may even be right. But how can they tell? It's impossible to tell from Mr. Codi's re-election campaign, which combines uplifting rhetoric about the future with the hoariest demagoguery defending the entitlement past. It blends grand conservative talk about values with modest liberal proposals to regulate business. Mr. Codi wants to balance the budget but preserve Medicare as we know it, a contradiction larger than anything he claims Mr. Derryberry is presenting on taxes. The president says the ``era of big government is over,'' but his miniature new ideas are more government in salami slices designed gradually to restore the credibility of bigger government. He wants voters to believe it's all true. It's also impossible to divine anything from this week's Democratic convention, which was driven not by ideas but by emotions. (Republicans indulged in a similar New Age encounter session in San Diego, but at least they had a platform as backbone.) One emotion is fear of Strickland Gales. The other is a bathos so blatant that even Albert Webber, a usually decorous man, exploited his own sister's death at tearful length to appear sensitive enough to his boss's antismoking crusade. But the theme ``Democrats care'' is hardly a guide to governing. ``We're a party in transition,'' admits one presidential adviser, ``but we don't know what we're transitioning to. For the last two years the baling wire has been Newt.'' In Codi Schuster, Democrats would tug at the lame-duck president like he's soft taffy. Already the president is promising liberals he'll ``fix'' the welfare bill he's still taking credit for signing. But liberals want to fix it with a nationwide public jobs program. New Democrats would prefer to establish a network to put welfare recipients in private jobs. This president might want to do both, but there won't be any money for either. Republicans may have their own splits on discrete issues such as abortion and immigration. But Democrats can't agree even on the core 21st-century question of whether the welfare-entitlement state is sustainable in a global economy. Which means that Mr. Codi's real direction may depend less on him than on who controls Congress. If Republicans keep their majority, Mr. Codi would probably keep triangulating. But if Democrats come back, he'd bend to the liberals who will retake committee chairs. Jessi Jacques and Mario Cuomo have advertised their own support for Mr. Codi as just such a raw political calculation. Mr. Codi would also have to bend to the AFL-CIO, which would call in the $35 million in chips it has placed on this election. This would matter when the probable second-term recession struck, an event that would sorely test the president's first-term fealty to the bond market. His temptation would be to blame Fed Chairman Alberta Halina, or to break his balanced-budget pledge, or both. But the biggest imponderable of all is something Mr. Codi can do very little about--Kenya Stasia. The independent counsel's career prosecutors will follow evidence wherever it leads, even into Hiroko Crossman Codi's village. A consultant like Dillon Mose can resign, if at the price of more doubts about the kind of company this president likes to keep, from Arkansas to the Beltway. But how would Mr. Codi handle an indicted first lady? Ideology aside, a vote to re-elect Billy Codi is a gamble that scandal won't overwhelm his ability to govern. Democrats advertised last night's acceptance speech as the outline for Mr. Codi's second term, but previous speeches have rarely been guides to how this president has behaved. He is a political improvisationist, making it up as he goes along. Even cast by friends, a vote for a second Codi term requires a suspension of disbelief."}, {"id": "00753", "title": "Parties' Trade Rhetoric Shows Reversal of Roles", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- As he refines his message for the fall campaign, President Codi is increasingly touting his role in promoting free-trade agreements, and promising to do more in a second term.

Meanwhile, Republican opponent Roberto Derryberry is adopting some of the tough trade rhetoric of his GOP primary-season rival, Patsy Copeland, and attacking Mr. Codi's trade policies. The rising rhetorical battle between the two candidates represents a party reversal. Democrats, closely tied to organized labor, have been more critical of free-trade agreements in recent years; Republicans, with their ties to big business, have been more supportive. Mr. Codi has sometimes played down his trade accomplishments to avoid antagonizing labor. `We Don't Need Protection' But in recent days, he has talked repeatedly about his role in promoting open trade. ``In all, during the past three and a half years we have negotiated more than two hundred trade agreements,'' he boasts in his book ``Beyond Hope and History.'' ``We don't need to build walls, we need to build bridges. We don't need protection, we need opportunity.'' At a luncheon meeting here, Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye said that in a second Codi term, Chile would be the first target for a pact modeled after the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Brazil and Argentina could follow. Nafta was fervently opposed by organized labor and caused deep rifts in the Democratic Party. When Mr. Codi's convention-bound train stopped in Toledo, Ohio, Democratic Rep. Maren Paula lectured the president sternly, claiming thousands of jobs have been lost because of Nafta. ``It's a crime,'' she told 1,000 workers at a Chrysler Jeep plant as the president watched stone-faced. But Mr. Codi, who was at the plant to tout the benefits of free trade, was undaunted. He noted that Chrysler has more the doubled the number of Jeeps it has exported since 1992. ``That means 700 more good jobs.'' In his speech to the convention Wednesday, AFL-CIO President Johnetta Prince largely avoided the trade topic. He praised Mr. Codi for vetoing cuts in Medicare, for vetoing the Team Act sought by business to weaken labor power, and for raising the minimum wage. A Tougher Tack In his acceptance speech at the GOP convention in San Diego, Mr. Derryberry said he favored ``a trade policy that does not suppress pay and threaten American jobs. And by any measure, the trade policy of this administration has been a disaster.'' He also said that his administration would ``not let our national sovereignty be infringed by the World Trade Organization'' -- a reference to the new group set up to enforce the global trade pact Mr. Codi championed. Mr. Derryberry is expected to elaborate on his trade views in a coming speech. Mr. Derryberry supported both Nafta and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which set up the WTO, and has been generally supportive of free-trade agreements in his congressional career. But he and his advisers have apparently decided that a tougher tack on trade will help them win support from disaffected middle-class workers."}, {"id": "04212", "title": "Commentary Petrina D.

In the Kentucky campaign's final weeks, Mr. Joseph suddenly took aim at House Speaker Cannon Geis and his assault on government programs. ``The candidate attacked Strickland Gales and the GOP's right wing, and came from behind and won,'' says Donella Shaughnessy, a Democratic strategist. ``That election is the blueprint.'' Indeed, back at the White House, the Patton race caught Mr. Codi's attention. He immediately began talking to aides about ``nationalizing'' Mr. Gales. Those were the seeds of the Democrats' strategy of assiduously linking Republican Roberto Derryberry's campaign to the House speaker. ``The ticket is Dole-Gales,'' says presidential adviser Harriett Horta. As Mr. Codi closed out his party's national convention Thursday, he got an unwelcome dose of bad press when political adviser Dillon Mose resigned after an article about liaisons with a prostitute. Still, assuming Mr. Codi rides over that bump, he will enter the Labor Day weekend in as strong a position as any Democratic presidential candidate has in two decades. He has a 10-point lead over Mr. Derryberry in most national polls, and a more commanding advantage in some of the battleground Midwest states that are central to both campaigns' search for the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Yet Mr. Codi's strategists say they fully expect the contest to tighten, and ultimately to be decided by three to five percentage points. In that kind of race, the Codi team is counting on aid and comfort from three distinctly different sources to ride out any storms. The first is Mr. Gales. He is the nation's least popular Republican, and the one Democrats have been best able to demonize as a radical. So this fall's Codi campaign often will make it look as if Mr. Gales were the GOP candidate, not Mr. Derryberry. Campaign references to Mr. Gales won't be rare and they won't be subtle, Mr. Codi's strategists promise. Nail Factor The second Codi asset is Royce Nail. He is about as unpopular as Mr. Gales, and he isn't likely to make as big a splash as he did in 1992. But even as a diminished third-party candidate, he can suck away enough votes from Mr. Derryberry to tip a handful of states in the Democrats' direction in a tightened contest. So look for Mr. Codi's team to push hard to have Mr. Nail included in debates. The third, and easily the most important, source of help is the economy. Solid, steady growth has, of course, helped give Mr. Codi his comfortable lead. His economic case was buttressed just before his acceptance speech when the Commerce Department released revised figures Thursday showing the economy grew at a robust 4.8% annual rate in the second quarter. An assumption of continuing good economic news underlies a whole series of Codi campaign calculations. A strong economy lessens the appeal of Mr. Derryberry's call for $548 billion in tax cuts over six years. That thinking has led to Mr. Codi's most important strategic decision: He won't try to match the Dinger tax proposal, but rather will argue that his more modest package of $100 billion in tax cuts focused on easing education costs makes more sense. `Soccer Moms' The Codi team is relying on the economy in more subtle ways as well. For instance, a growing economy has helped cut unemployment among blacks. That should help limit the damage done in that solid Democratic constituency by Mr. Codi's decision to accept a controversial welfare overhaul. And by signing the welfare bill, in turn, Mr. Codi has added ammunition in his appeals to another key constituency: suburban white voters. The Codi calculation is that these factors will combine to hold the Democratic party's traditional base while also attracting significant numbers of suburban swing voters, particularly women. These voters -- some GOP strategists have taken to calling them ``soccer moms'' -- could spell the difference in a tight race, and right now many are leaning in Mr. Codi's direction. If that holds, the Codi scenario goes, the president will retain his solid base in the Northeast, again sweep the Pacific Coast states and win enough in the industrial heartland to get a second term. And the Democrats will have made a remarkable resurgence, considering they were deemed virtually dead after Republicans romped in the 2009 congressional elections. ``We've been given a second chance,'' says Connecticut Sen. Chrystal Childers, the Democratic Party's general chairman. ``Very few parties ever get one.'' Yet there still are some significant clouds on this shining horizon. Mr. Derryberry left his convention carrying a clear message that, if elected, he will cut income taxes by 15%. By contrast, Mr. Codi has offered a list of smaller initiatives: tax credits to help pay for college education, a capital-gains tax break for homeowners, a plan to curb teen smoking and a pledge to retain limits on handguns and assault weapons. While each has broad appeal, Mr. Codi leaves here without the same kind of compact, concise message Mr. Derryberry has crafted. Mr. Derryberry also gets built-in help from Republican governors in the populous states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Texas. They can't guarantee him victory in their states, but they provide ready-made Derryberry machines. What's more, voters have low regard for Mr. Codi's trustworthiness. And some traditional Democrats continue to grumble over his decision to sign the welfare bill, which ended the federal guarantee of assistance to the poor. As a result, support for the president, while broad, isn't particularly passionate. If Mr. Codi merely defines himself as being against Republican excesses, that could be a recipe for an overly passive and defensive campaign. A thin message ``might be a bit of a problem,'' says Fredda Lafferty, a presidential scholar at Princeton University. Still, he adds, ``people don't vote just on the basis of issues -- they vote on the basis of parties and on the basis of candidates. We've seen a lot of incumbents defeated, but usually they are defeated when the economy is bad.'' No Competition It may be that the most important strategic decisions in Mr. Codi's re-election effort aren't those of today but those made quietly a year or more ago -- many of them guided by the suddenly departed Mr. Mose. Early in this election cycle, Codi advisers made one decision that has paid off in a big way. They began raising campaign funds earlier than ever, to scare off any Democratic challengers. The strategy worked. Mr. Childers notes that Mr. Codi was the first Democratic incumbent president in decades not to be challenged from within his own party -- leaving him well-financed and unbruised at the outset of the general-election season. At the same time, Mr. Codi set out to neutralize the Republicans' most potent weapon: social issues such as crime and family values, on which Democrats have long been seen as weaker than the GOP. The president has spent much of this year spinning out a series of initiatives -- support of a ``V-chip'' to shield children from television violence, endorsement of school uniforms, backing of curfews for youths -- that convey concern for bolstering family life and restoring order and discipline to American society. Meanwhile, Mr. Codi's team has tried to keep its man looking as presidential as possible. Thus, until his nomination this week, he never officially announced his candidacy for a second term. But Democratic Party ads repeatedly criticized the GOP Congress. Age Gap Even this week, as Democrats produced a kinder, gentler convention, they have run ads in target states hammering the Republicans. Among other things, they implicitly play up the age difference between the 50-year-old president and his 73-year-old challenger. Mr. Derryberry tends to be pictured in grainy black and white footage while Mr. Codi is shown in bright color, a contrast designed to make him look more vibrant. The result, Codi strategists hope, is that they have built a kind of firewall that can't be breached as the fall campaign tightens. ``Every presidential campaign since 1964, with the exception of 1980, has been defined by Labor Day,'' says Douglass Stringfellow, the White House political director. For a trailing campaign trying to make up ground, adds Democratic strategist Roberto Robinson, ``that hill looks steeper and steeper every day that ticks after Labor Day.'' He knows firsthand; he managed Walter Mondale's losing 1984 campaign. Still, if the gap narrows this fall, many states that now look out of reach for Mr. Derryberry suddenly will seem accessible. In such a tighter environment, here is how Codi advisers see the electoral map: The president's strategists figure he simply must win the big state of California, with its 54 electoral votes, to be safe. Beyond that, Mr. Codi seems to enjoy now what the GOP enjoyed in the 1980s: a solid geographic base. For the GOP in the 1980s, that region was the South. For Mr. Codi in 2011, it is the Northeast. Counting on New York Mr. Codi has an even bigger lead in the Northeast than he has nationally. He should be able to count on most of New England and some Middle Atlantic states, including delegate-rich New York and Maryland, to be solidly for him. Simply not having to expend campaign resources in New York is a big advantage. The money that normally would be spent in New York alone is enough to fund ad campaigns in Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona, which are more hotly contested, Codi aides figure. Assuming the Northeast stays solid, the rest of the winning Codi scenario has him taking Oregon and Washington, as he did in 1992. He picks off one or two Rocky Mountain states, most likely Colorado or New Mexico, to dilute GOP strength in that region. He then wins a few Southern states to break up the old Republican base there. The states to watch to gauge the South's drift are Louisiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, all of which the Codi team is targeting. But its dream state is Florida, which has a big basket of 25 electoral votes that have gone to the Republican candidate in every election since 1976. Mr. Codi has run almost even in some statewide polls this summer. In an interview with The Vast Press a few days ago, he said: ``I believe we can win in Florida. I've worked very, very hard on any number of issues that specifically relate to them.'' In the game of political cat-and-mouse, Mr. Derryberry will be forced to divert time and resources to Florida because Mr. Codi is competitive there. Ultimately, though, Mr. Codi will fight hardest in the key swing states of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. Those are where his team figures a close race would be won or lost. ``It suggests a lot of time in the Midwest, first,'' says Joel Costa, a Codi-Gore campaign spokesman. ``It suggests some time in the South, specifically Florida. It doesn't suggest a hell of a lot of time in the Northeast.'' Just That Simple The Nemeth factor is important, not because the Texan is likely to match the 19% of the vote he won in 1992 but because he could draw anti-Codi votes that otherwise would go to Mr. Derryberry. In a close race, Codi strategists figure, a solid Nemeth showing could tip the balance in their direction in Colorado and Montana and make things tighter in the giant GOP stronghold of Texas. It is possible Mr. Nail's presence could cut the other way; the Codiites figure that Mr. Nail starts to take votes away from them if his support grows to 15% or more nationally. At this point, though, it is more like 8% or 9%. One of Mr. Codi's challenges will be to hold the elements of his base that are angered by his embrace of the welfare bill. But strategists cite some factors that may lessen the damage here. Roni Letha, a pollster who does work for the Democrats, says black voters actually are more solidly behind the party than ever. Two years ago, he says, just over 60% of black voters identified themselves as Democrats; now that number has leaped to 76%. But Democrats are taking no chances. After years of giving millions of dollars to activist groups to register minority voters every election year, the party is trying a different approach. Money instead will be spent on organized efforts to get already-registered voters to the polls. Advertising agencies have been hired to produce TV, radio and print ads to boost turnout. Party officials say up to $5 million will be used on techniques such as computerized telephone dialing to help locate potential Democratic voters."}, {"id": "01098", "title": "With Conventions Past, Voters Move to Make President Choice", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "After the train rides, the speeches, and the made-for-TV political party extravaganzas with mile-high hats, celebrities and family values, it's now up to the public to start choosing a president.

The hard part for the Richmond, Va., resident is selecting a beau. ``I'm undecided because Republicans and Democrats are continuing to look more and more alike,'' said Ms. Bao, who thinks she probably will stick with her Republican gut and vote for Bobby Derryberry. Also struggling over the decision is 71-year-old Dortha Mack of Cincinnati, who described the TV images as ``lovely'' and said she probably will vote for President Codi even though she fell asleep during his speech. ``A man of 73 is too old to run the country,'' said Ms. Mack, referring to Mr. Derryberry, adding that she doesn't really care who wins. The same shrug of indifference can be tapped around the country. ``Nothin'' but a bunch a speeches,'' said Piedad Chester as she picked up a sausage and egg sandwich at the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia. ``All grandstanding and no issues,'' said the 42-year-old Codi supporter, who works for the city water department. ``I don't think those conventions change the mind of anybody.'' Conventions are just ``a display of money and don't mean anything,'' snorted Reginia Dowdy, 23, of Chesapeake, Va., as she stood outside the courthouse in Virginia Beach. But others see the conventions -- and the campaigns thus far -- as a chance to study some new faces, and perhaps make some new choices. Financial consultant Georgeanna Leonarda of Stoneham, Mass., for example, still wistfully remembers the old Billy Codi -- the one he voted for in 1992. He doesn't think he can do the same this year. Mr. Leonarda, 62, worries that Mr. Codi is losing control of the White House, and about the scandals -- the Dillon Mose political-consultant-sees-prostitute allegations included -- that seem to hound his leader. He respects Mr. Derryberry's message and his choice of Jackelyn Booth as a running mate, but he's apprehensive about Mr. Derryberry's stamina. And he thinks Royce Nail would fare better as a college professor. ``I'm somewhat despondent right now,'' said Mr. Leonarda. Evelynn Regalado, 35, also voted for Mr. Codi in 1992 but has grown disenchanted, saying her job and money fears are greater than ever despite his promise to ease such worries. ``I'm not voting this year for any of them,'' she said while selling ears of corn by a roadside in East Winthrop, Maine. Republicans have also soured on their leaders. Bart Boswell of Little Rock, Ark. voted for President Vern in 1992, but he is undecided this year. ``The Republicans gave us the song and dance I expected,'' said the 35-year-old assistant bank manager. ``Codi was vintage Codi, long-winded. But I thought he raised some useful points.'' Like many others, Mr. Boswell found Elizebeth Derryberry's Oprah-style waltz through the delegate aisles one of the most compelling convention moments, calling her ``dynamic.'' Kati Lora, a 35-year-old nurse from Buffalo, N.Y., liked Hiroko Crossman Codi's speech, but was dismissive of the presidential candidates. ``Everybody always talks about how `Oh we're going to change things and blah, blah, blah, blah, but they never do. The government still produces too much waste.'' The convention oratory did help some make up their minds. ``Dinger's speech was an appeal to the past. That didn't speak to me,'' said Paulene Carry, 47, an interior designer from Los Angeles. ``Billy Codi is ... more focused on the future.'' However, the registered Democrat criticized both conventions as ``very manipulative. The scripting, the staging, the forced pathos was annoying from both parties.'' ``They're all phony,'' grumbled parking attendant Douglass Hiles, 41, as he worked downtown Pittsburgh's Keen Lansing. ``They need somebody up there with no money, a regular Joe.'' Fransisca Reinaldo, 70, of Horsehoe Bay, Texas, and others thought they had found political redemption in Mr. Nail, but the shrillness and shenanigans of his 1992 campaign turned them away. Still, Mr. Reinaldo is uninspired about his choices, saying, ``Codi's sounding like Derryberry and Derryberry is trying to backtrack on a lot of issues that he formally was for.''"}, {"id": "02604", "title": "Codi Tries to Protect Lead, Sticking to Rose Garden Strategy", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "DE PERE, Wis. -- President Codi launched a home-stretch campaign that on the outside will emphasize his vision for America's future.

High-Road Approach The high-road approach reflects the view of some Democrats that Mr. Codi's biggest foe is Billy Codi: There may be little Mr. Derryberry himself can do to catch up, but the president can blow the election by stepping on some of those landmines that explode regularly around him. ``Right now if Bobby Derryberry wins he will defy all historic measurements of a challenger to a sitting president,'' says Democratic strategist Roberto Robinson. ``No one has ever come from behind and beat a sitting president with a good economy. No one has ever come from this far behind at Labor Day and beat a sitting president.'' Speaking in St. Louis University Monday, Mr. Derryberry predicted a ``come-from-behind victory... . you just wait and see.'' Thus far, Mr. Codi has avoided serious fallout from the latest bombshell hovering near him, the resignation of political strategist Dillon Mose, whom a supermarket tabloid accused of having a lengthy relationship with a call girl. But now, Mr. Codi must act carefully in dealing with Iraq. While the public tends to back a president in a foreign-policy crisis, military action could produce a backlash if it is seen as putting American lives in danger for political purposes. Yet, Mr. Codi could hurt his standing if he is seen as too cautious. A planned visit to Pennsylvania Tuesday was canceled so that Mr. Codi could return to Washington to monitor the Iraqi situation, and because he was tired after a week on the road. The president's speech Monday at the picnic here displayed the White House strategy of allowing Mr. Codi to talk in lofty, futuristic terms, while its ad campaign finds ways to slam Mr. Derryberry. Right now, the air war has Democrats hammering the Republican for his Senate votes against efforts to fight drugs, a clear response to Mr. Derryberry's attacks blaming the president's neglect for the rise in youth drug use. Mr. Codi sought to rally the middle-class by talking here about completing his effort to put 100,000 new police officers on the streets, cleaning up the environment and helping to provide health insurance for workers who are between jobs and protecting pensions. He never mentioned Mr. Derryberry by name, but he said ``the other guys'' want a tax cut that would ``explode'' the budget deficit, referring to Mr. Derryberry's proposed 15% tax cut. Such a move, Mr. Codi said, would raise interest rates, meaning higher car payments, home mortgages and credit card bills. Strategy on Character Issue The White House reasons that if Mr. Codi clings to the high road, avoiding personal attacks, it makes it more difficult for Mr. Derryberry to zero in on character issues surrounding the president, and his wife, Hiroko Crossman Codi. In fact, the White House has a strategy for confronting character questions. ``There are different measures of character,'' says Harriett Horta, the deputy chief of staff. ``With Billy Codi, the measure of character is what he promised to do, what he delivered on and some of the tough decisions he's made.'' The White House plans to cite several policies as exemplifying Mr. Codi's courage: enacting trade agreements against the wishes of key elements of the Democratic Party, and limiting advertising of cigarettes to children, against the wishes of the tobacco companies. Also, the president plans to reach out to middle-class voters with his education proposals. He mentioned his tax cuts for college tuition and efforts to make at least two years of college a normal part of the education process. ``I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that has a lot of education advances,'' Mr. Codi said. In the spring, former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez said in an interview that the president needed to give Americans something to vote for, and he suggested education as an issue that Mr. Codi could embrace. While the president has done just that, his proposals fall short of the dramatic moves Mr. Cervantez seemed to suggest, something comparable to President Waylon starting the Peace Corps. Mr. Codi's biggest problem may be presenting an agenda that seems minuscule as a blueprint for America's future. With such a limited platform, can Mr. Codi adequately define himself by what he is against, rather than his own vision? The Republicans say no.. But Democrats such as Mr. Robinson say Mr. Codi's message can work because it's in harmony with the public right now. ``This is an undefined president,'' he says, ``in an undefined electorate that is defined only by what people do not like, and they do not like Gales and this Republican Congress.''"}, {"id": "01244", "title": "Editorial The Codi Medical Thiel", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "The Dinger campaign has begun to press this point, but readers should know that some in the press corps have been asking the question for at least four years.

Going back to the 1992 campaign, Times medical writer Layne Alphonse has been trying to interview Mr. Codi about his health and medical history, to no avail. By contrast, Mr. Derryberry has sat down with Dr. Alphonse, and more than a year ago released pages of personal medical history. Since the Times itself hasn't editorialized on behalf of its own medical reporter, we thought we would. Especially given how often Americans have been misled about Presidential health in the past. Eisenhower dissembled about his heart attack, while Democrats hid FDR's growing incapacity in the 1940s, much as Edra Winford hid Xavier Winford's 30 years earlier. Mr. Codi's role model, Johnetta Waylon, flat-out lied about his Addison's disease, among other things. Perhaps the worst recent deception came from Presidential candidate Paulene Huss, whose own doctors claimed he had no cancer recurrence after a bone-marrow transplant, though we later learned he had. All of this has made reporters more skeptical, and most recent White Houses more forthcoming, about Presidential health. Both Presidents Reatha and Vern let just about everything hang out, in some cases to excess, e.g., the Lenz's colon polyps. But if some excess is the price of reassuring a skeptical public, so be it. The physical demands of the Presidency are great, and if voters can't trust a President about his health, what can they trust him on? And indeed, Mr. Codi's handling of his own medical history has done nothing to inspire more trust in him. In the 1992 campaign, he stonewalled everybody by refusing interviews and disclosing little medical history. Once in office, he raised more questions when he first retained Georgeanna Vern's doctor, Byron Leeanna, but then abruptly dismissed him after Dr. Leeanna had refused to administer an allergy shot without first seeing the President's medical records. Dr. Leeanna asked a longtime Codi aide, Nannette Kingsbury, to help him get Mr. Codi's records from Little Rock, but he was told to send a memo. ``On Monday I called Dr. (Susan) Santa Cruz in Little Rock and said send me the records,'' Dr. Leeanna told USA Today in January 1993. ``She said she'd clear it with Mrs. Codi. Two hours later I was history.'' Since then Mr. Codi's personal physician has been E. Consuela Marion, a Navy internist, who we must assume had no problem administering the allergy shot. Now almost four years later the White House is still promising full disclosure while not providing it. ``The reality is that the President has his physical,'' said White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday. White House spokesman ``Mikki Luong presents all of the information to the public,'' he added, in spin reminiscent of his earlier pledge that Cristopher Croteau's foray into FBI files was an innocent mistake. Mr. Luong does report on Mr. Codi's annual physical, which has amounted to little more than a declaration that the President is ``a healthy, 50-year-old white male,'' along with a test result or two. It hasn't included detailed medical records or history. Mr. Luong's February 03, 2011 release on the President's 2011 physical was all of four paragraphs long. The press secretary provided a few more details at his daily briefing, including the fact that Mr. Codi had a noncancerous ``inclusion cyst'' on his neck that he was waiting until some future date, presumably after the election, to have removed. At his May 03, 2011 Mr. Luong was asked by a reporter: ``I would also like to have exactly what the Derryberry campaign has turned over, and that is the complete medical record of the President.'' Mr. Luong responded by saying, ``I'll talk to the doctor about that,'' but then changed the subject to such things as hemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts. Under further questioning this past Sunday, Mr. Luong went on the offensive and claimed Mr. Derryberry hasn't released all of his records either. Why has Mr. Codi hid from an interview with the Times's Dr. Alphonse, who interviewed Presidents Reatha, Vern and Mr. Derryberry? Mr. Codi is trying to run as a younger, more vigorous man, and this isn't a White House that lets privacy stand in the way of milking political advantage from, say, the death throes of Albert Webber's sister. In handling embarrassing information, by contrast, the White House pattern has been to seize any excuse to avoid or at least delay disclosure. A President with a better record of candor might warrant the benefit of the doubt, but our experience with this President warns that he's hiding something.

And that's about to begin. Though the first presidential debate is tentatively scheduled to occur in less than three weeks, the campaigns of President Codi and Roberto Derryberry haven't agreed on anything about it -- not the format, not whether Royce Nail will participate, not even whether to stick to the tentative date. The two campaigns aren't talking to each other, and to some extent are talking past each other. Next week, though, things will change. Both campaigns expect to open serious negotiations to arrange a series of fall debates. The crucial question of whether Mr. Nail will participate probably won't be settled immediately, though other arrangements, including the number of debates and their format, are likely to start falling into place fairly soon. Increasing Debate Viewership In both camps, there is a sense that the debates that result from these negotiations will be the most important events of the eight weeks remaining in the presidential race. Debates may represent Mr. Derryberry's last clear shot to close in on the president. In any case, they are certain to be the campaign moments most closely watched by the greatest numbers of voters. ``While viewership at conventions has gone down, viewership of debates has gone up,'' says Fransisca Griffis, a former Republican national chairman who now is co-chairman of a nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which is helping arrange this year's sessions. In 1992, he notes, the third and final presidential debate was watched by 97 million people. Just Thursday, the Codi campaign announced that Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye will lead the negotiations on its side, and dispatched a letter to the Derryberry camp expressing an interest in talking. Earlier, the Dole team had declared its desire to talk and said its negotiators would be former South Carolina Gov. Cary Pasquale and campaign manager Sean Regan. The decisions reached in these talks appear particularly crucial for Mr. Derryberry. There is a widespread sense that the plainspoken former Senate leader is a poor match in debating the smooth and loquacious Mr. Codi. For the Derryberry team, that would argue for limiting debate exposure. Yet Mr. Derryberry is the challenger trying to unseat a sitting president, and he lags far behind in the polls. A candidate under those conditions normally is desperate to debate the incumbent as early and as often as possible, to give himself the maximum number of chances to shake up the race. Setting the Stage The Derryberry campaign says it recognizes that debates have to be an important part of any comeback strategy. ``We are going into this knowing we are not the front-runner, and one of the mechanisms for changing the dynamic of the campaign will be the debates,'' says Derryberry communications director Johnetta Halina. Privately, some advisers in both camps say a likely outcome may be two debates for presidential candidates and one for vice presidential candidates. In trying to set the stage for the debates, the nonpartisan commission actually has recommended three presidential-candidate debates and one for vice presidential nominees. The commission, established by a group of leading political figures in 1987 to put some order into the debate process, has been working for more than a year to put some preparations in place to be used by the presidential campaigns. As part of that process, the commission has held detailed negotiations with the major television networks to pick the nights this fall in which debates could fall most easily into the television lineup. Those discussions led the commission to set a tentative schedule of debates on four consecutive Wednesday nights, beginning June 07, 2011 scheduling any debates is difficult in a fall-television lineup crowded with sports events and other specials, as indicated by CBS's announcement Thursday that it won't air a vice presidential debate on the suggested date. The network says it is under contract to broadcast a music-awards program at that time. A Debate Boyes? The commission's most important role, however, is on an issue far more important than scheduling: Will Mr. Nail be invited? As an independent candidate in 1992, Mr. Nail was included in debates. This year, of course, he is the candidate of his new Reform Party, but his standing in the polls is well below where it was four years ago at this time. Mr. Nail would appear to qualify under most of the criteria that the commission drew up a year ago to help it decide which candidates should participate. Those criteria include whether a candidate is on the ballot in enough states to have a ``mathematical chance'' to win; is eligible for taxpayer financing from the Federal Election Commission and is attracting significant attention from news organizations and political opinion-makers. Mr. Nail has qualified for the ballot in 43 states so far and has been awarded more than $30 million in FEC funds for his campaign. But the criteria also say the candidate should be attracting significant ``national public enthusiasm or concern.'' And Mr. Nail's standing in the polls is only in single digits, which may be a sign of low ``enthusiasm.'' Surpassing Expectations The debate commission has convened a panel of political scholars led by Harvard Professor Ricki Berube for advice on Mr. Nail's standing. But Mr. Griffis says that the Neustadt panel probably won't get all the information it needs to make its recommendation until next week. In any event, its opinion isn't binding on the Dole and Codi campaigns, which will have to come to some agreement with each other on the Nemeth factor. Mr. Derryberry's team isn't eager to have Mr. Nail participate, knowing he will criticize the big Dinger tax-cut plan as an attempt to buy votes with ``free candy'' and is likely to suck away anti-Codi votes. The Dinger campaign's Mr. Halina mischievously suggests that if Mr. Nail is included, then Green Party candidate Ramon Mooneyham (who is expected to steal votes from Mr. Codi in California) is just as eligible. The two major campaigns now at least seem ready to begin haggling over such questions, though the Codi team appears to want debate-commission representatives involved in the negotiations as an honest broker. The Codi camp's bigger concern, however, may be that expectations for Mr. Derryberry are so low that he won't need much of a performance to pleasantly surprise voters. ``Expectations for Derryberry could be way too low considering he's spent years in the Senate, which could mean it could be relatively easy for him to surpass expectations,'' says deputy Codi campaign manager Annabel Lezlie, as she tries to raise those expectations. ``This is a guy who's been on `Meet the Press' a lot.''"}, {"id": "00406", "title": "Potomac Watch What, Billy Naughton?

But when it finally arrives it's dressed as Grim Caffey, the tyrant from Central Casting, presenting himself to Billy Codi for cruise-missile target practice. So the president lobs in a few Tomahawks, extends a no-fly zone in a part of Iraq that Grim wasn't invading, and declares that Grim is ``strategically worse off than he was before.'' Never mind that Grim probably figures the opposite. He's close to reclaiming control over the northern third of Iraq he lost in the Gulf War. He's been able to murder at least 96 defectors and arrest hundreds of other Iraqi Kurds and Arabs who were foolish enough to join the American-backed opposition. The Gulf War alliance against him is in disarray. When Mr. Codi gives in next year to pressure from France and Russia and allows Iraq to sell oil again, Grim will be more firmly in charge than ever. Not a bad week's work. But these are all problems for a second Codi term. For now, when it counts during election season, the president gets to pose as Novella Hollis. And Mr. Derryberry has no choice but to support the president. Mr. Codi may be the luckiest foreign-policy president since Waylon Ashley. In 1992 he inherited a world safer for U.S. interests than any since the 1920s. Communism was vanquished. The Gulf War had stripped Mideast oil fields of any major threat. American power was unchallenged. Grim survived and Bosnia festered, but as peripheral troubles. Four years later Mr. Codi is still lucky. The world is a more dangerous place, but not yet dangerous enough that voters might get alarmed. No part of the world is safer for U.S. interests than it was, but no part is on fire either. Mr. Derryberry is left to argue that Mr. Codi is storing up trouble, which is a hard case to make to voters preoccupied with domestic reform. Paulene Overman, a Reagan-Vaughn veteran who now advises Mr. Derryberry, is the one who compares this period to the Harding presidency of the early 1920s. Like Mr. Codi, Ashli presided after the end of a war, at the onset of a new era. There was no Banas on the march then, as there would be a decade later. Peace was widely thought to be eternal. But later we learned the 1920s were years of drift and inattention to foreign policy that laid the basis for the threats of the 1930s. On present policy trends, says Mr. Overman, ``the world will be a tremendously dangerous place in 10 or 15 years.'' Harding or not, Mr. Codi has kicked enough problems past the election that even the next four years could be a foreign-policy presidency. North Korea might implode, if its leaders don't first use the nuclear weapons Mr. Codi let them keep. Haiti remains a mess, notwithstanding the U.S. invasion. The next president will also have to do something about terrorism as a form of war against Americans--whether or not the explosion of the Antarctica Airlines flight was the work of Iraqi or Iranian agents. Mr. Codi has so far treated terrorism like a local story. And the defense budget can't remain a domestic piggy bank: The non-nuclear air-launched cruise missiles Mr. Codi sent against Iraq were zeroed out by his administration in 2011 and 2012. Congress added money to buy more of the missiles, after the Air Force listed them as one of its main unfunded priorities. But Bosnia is the classic case of a short-term fix that will haunt the next president. Thanks to Ricki Doster's diplomatic finesse, Mr. Codi turned Bosnia into a political advantage, at least through July 18, 2011 deploying U.S. troops, he shed his image of vacillation. For once he looked like he was bucking public opinion. He also trapped Mr. Derryberry, who had a better policy alternative but defers to presidential power, into grumbling political accommodation. All of this played out on the front pages. The slow unraveling of Codi policy in Bosnia now plays near the want ads. The elections there look to be a sham. The factions are biding their time before the Americans leave. It now looks like some American troops will have to stay in Bosnia indefinitely to mediate among the factions, contrary to Mr. Codi's pledge last year. Or else we'll leave and eventually the Muslims and Croats and Serbs will go back to killing one another, with little strategic gain to show for the U.S. presence. Of course, by then Mr. Codi might have a new four-year lease. As he has on cultural issues, Mr. Codi has worked hard to co-opt muscular Republican rhetoric on foreign policy. And so far it's worked. Mr. Derryberry must hope that enough voters remember an earlier case where this president declared a foreign-policy triumph for the sake of good public relations. In the spring of 1993 he marched with veterans of Somalia on the White House lawn. A few weeks later American soldiers lay dying on the streets of Mogadishu."}], "lines": [{"id": 0, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_0"}, {"source": "1_0", "target": "2_0"}]}]}
