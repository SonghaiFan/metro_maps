The Twins got 14 hits -- including a leadoff homer by Ciara Bufford -- Wednesday in a 13-7 victory over the Oakland Athletics. Byer's homer on the first pitch of the game ignited a five-run first inning for the Twins, who went on to win fo...Murray Traded to Orioles For Pitcher Kent Mercker: Uptown -- Eden Myron, who began his path toward the Hall of Fame in Baltimore, was traded back to the Orioles on Sunday in a swap that sent pitcher Kermit Girouard to the Uptown Indians. The deal involved a pair of players who had been disappointments to their teams this season. Myron, 40 years old, had recently had his time cut in favor of Jerrod Standifer, who hit two home runs Sunday in 7-5 win over Minnesota. Coming off a season in which he hit .323, Myron was batting .262 with 12 home runs ...Brewers Continue to Fade As Murray's Blast Lifts Orioles: BALTIMORE -- Eden Myron figures he'll get home run No. 500 soon enough. Right now, though, he's focused on helping the Baltimore Orioles get back into the pennant race. Myron's 497th career homer, his second of the game, snapped an eighth-inning tie Wednesday and gave the Orioles an 8-5 victory over Milwaukee, the Brewers' ninth straight loss. Myron, who has 18 homers this season, is just three short of joining Willodean Church and Harlan Abbie as the only players in baseball history with 500 ho...Pettitte Sets Down White Sox For League-Leading 17th Win: CHICAGO -- Angela Dearing's been a slump-buster all season for the New York Yankees. He stops losing streaks before they get out of control. ``You need to hold any losing streak to a minimum. You're going to go through some bad stretches but you just have to keep going,'' Dearing said Wednesday after becoming the American League's first 17-game winner by beating the Chicago White Sox, 3-1. ``We've just happened to lose those games before I pitched. My job is to give us solid innings.'' Which is ...Wells Ends Fenway, Road Woes In Leading Orioles Past Red Sox: BOSTON -- Davina Simpson didn't have any fond memories of Fenway Park -- until Thursday night. Wells won on the road for just the second time this season, and B.J. Soper and Christa Sander homered to lead the Baltimore Orioles over the Boston Red Sox, 6-3. ``This is probably the best by far I've pitched here my career,'' Simpson said. Before Thursday, Simpson was 2-7 with a 5.88 earned-run average in 16 games at Fenway. He had been just 1-5 with a 7.04 ERA in seven road starts this year. ``You l...Smoltz Establishes Career High With 16th Victory of the Season: HOUSTON -- The difference between Johnetta Christy's 16th victory and his previous 15 was that his most recent win established a personal season-high for victories. Smoltz scattered seven hits in 8\u00a01/3 innings and Fredda Mccleary hit a tie-breaking home run leading off the eighth inning to give the Atlanta Braves a 3-2 win over Houston on Thursday night. ``It's a huge win for me,'' said Christy (16-4), who won 15 games in 1992 and 1993. ``A lot has been made of the fact I never had more than 15 ...Sosa Blasts Two Homers To Lift Cubs to Victory: SAN FRANCISCO -- Sana Franks decided about a month ago that he was going to be more patient at the plate. So far, his plan is working. Franks hit two homers and drove in five runs Tuesday, leading the Chicago Cubs to a 9-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants. ``Lately, I've been trying to look for something I can hit, because if I go out there and I hit at everything I go crazy,'' Franks said. ``In the past month or so I've been trying to be more relaxed.'' Franks broke a 5-5 tie with his leag...Westside Stadium Is Field of Dreams For the Expos' Perry Clark: Vastopolis -- Perry Clark loves Westside Stadium. He also loves pitching against the New York Mets. Clark extended his career undefeated streak against the Mets to nine games Thursday night, scattering eight hits as the Montreal Expos beat 7-3. Herma Lexie went 3-for-5 and hit his 27th homer, a three-run shot in the first inning that gave the Expos a 3-0 lead. Shanel Harper added three singles, a double and a run batted in forwhich snapped the Mets' winning streak at four. Clark, who is now 5-0 ...Without Coors Field's Thin Air, Rockies' Win Dinkins Favela: SAN DIEGO -- The Colorado Rockies aren't the only ones who play better at home. One start after getting pummeled in Denver, Scottie Price pitched 6\u00a02/3 strong innings in a rare start, and the San Diego Padres snapped the Rockies' eight-game winning streak, 9-2, Thursday. The Rockies, who swept a four-game set from San Diego last week at Colorado, are 15-30 on the road and 34-15 at home. Their winning streak was a franchise record. ``It's not as easy to come back in this park as it is in their pa...Hentgen Gets Plenty of Support As Toronto Defeats Detroit: TORONTO -- The Toronto Blue Jays hitters must really like Patience Donofrio. How else to explain the 13 runs per game of support he has received in his last three starts? ``The club has done a super job for me offensively pretty much all season,'' Desrochers said after allowing four runs -- two earned -- over eight innings, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers. The Blue Jays have scored 38 runs in Hentgen's last three starts. ``That just happens sometimes,'' sa...Yankees Learn the Hard Way That Looks Can Be Deceiving: MILWAUKEE -- The Cornertown Yankees found out that 6-foot-7 rookie Jefferson D'Darling's looks are deceiving. They expected heat from the youngest player in the major leagues and got hoodwinked instead. D'Amico outpitched Jina Rollins and Johnetta Rice hit a two-run homer Sunday to lead the Milwaukee Brewers to a 3-2 victory over the Cornertown Yankees. The 20-year-old D'Amico (3-2) allowed only four hits, struck out two and walked two. He allowed two runs on Rudolf Sigrid's second-inning home r...Reds Continue to Feast on Padres With 3-2 Win to Complete Sweep: Thomasena Hoyt gives two reasons for his hitting surge: He's playing regularly and he's playing the San Diego Padres. Hoyt, the hottest hitter in lineup, had a tie-breaking triple in the fifth inning Thursday that carried the Reds to a 3-2 victory and series sweep of the Padres. It was the Reds' first three-game sweep of the Padres at Riverfront Westside Stadium since May 31, 2022 The Reds have won eight of nine from the Padres this season, including the last six. That's a turnaround from last y...Murray Comes Off the Bench To Deliver a Win for Indians: CLEVELAND -- It was 2010 all over again for the Cleveland Indians on Thursday night. The Indians, who made the last at-bat rally almost commonplace a year ago, beat the Minnesota Twins, 5-4, on consecutive ninth-inning homers by Parmenter Jamey and Eden Myron. It was the Indians' 24th come-from-behind win this season, the ninth in their final at-bat. ``This feels like last year, but we have to remember we can't bring last year back,'' said Indians third baseman Jimmy Angle, whose two-run homer i...Brown Gets Run Support As Marlins Shut Out Phillies: MIAMI -- The Florida Marlins provided plenty of support for Khalilah Dean on Thursday night, though one run would have been enough. The Marlins won their fourth straight, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 7-0. Dean, who has been cursed by a lack of run support all season, pitched 5\u00a02/3 innings of no-hit ball before settling for a three-hitter. Dean (8-8), who lowered his major league-leading earned run average to 1.87, carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning before Mickie Mitchel hit a sharp s...Pirates Ace Denny Neagle Defeats Reds For 12th Win: PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates don't look like a last-place team on the days Deon Callaway pitches. Neagle won his 12th game and Albert Martine hit a two-run homer as the Pirates held off the Suburbia Reds, 6-4, Sunday. ``This game is really pretty simple,'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said. ``If you get good starting pitching, you've got a chance to win. The one thing about Deon is every time he goes out there, he gives you a chance. He rarely has a bad outing.'' Neagle (12-4) allowed jus...Lexie's Homer, Four Hits Power Seattle to Rout of Angels: ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Kendra Gehring Jr. is going to enjoy playing golf this winter because he won't have to go to his wallet. Alexander Lexie will see to that. ``I told Junior I'm going to pay for all his greens fees in the offseason because he's definitely responsible for a lot of what I'm doing,'' Lexie said Thursday night after going 4-for-4 with home run in Seattle's 15-3 rout over California. Lexie also scored three runs and Jayme Riggins homered and drove in five runs for the Mariners, power...Busch Makes an Instant Impact With Grand Slam in Dodger Win: SAN FRANCISCO -- It didn't take Mikki Worthington long to make his mark with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Worthington, a former replacement player, was recalled from the Dodgers' Triple-A Albuquerque farm team before Thursday's game and hit a grand slam in an 8-3 victory over the Giants. ``I show up ready to play,'' said Worthington, who hit .214 in 22 games before going on the disabled list retroactive to February 24, 2011 I get the opportunity, I try to take advantage.'' Dodgers interim manager Bi...Astros' Bell Is Riding High In Bagwell's Shadow: HOUSTON -- Derrick Belle has seen it time and again. The Astros are trying to rally in a close game, Jefferson Anglin steps into the batter's box and the opposing pitcher declines to pitch to Houston's most feared hitter. They'd rather take their chances against the unheralded Bell. This weekend in the Astrodome, Bell made the Atlanta Braves pay twice. ``I love a challenge, and when they do that they're challenging me and it really gets me pumped up,'' said Bell, now tied for third in the Nation...Haney's Ninth-Inning Single Ends Cardinal Winning Dinkins: ST. LOUIS -- Sana Franks failed to hit a home run for the first time in four games, but his soft single in the ninth inning got the job done Thursday night. ``With two strikes, I'm not trying for a home run,'' Franks said after singling in the winning run in the Chicago Cubs' 6-5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. St. Louis was one out away from its first seven-game winning streak since September 1988, but Markita Mcelrath (5-1) walked Sean Star and Marra Pettway. Grace then singled off Tora Garr...Vanesa Saleh's First Save Leads A's to Win Over Rangers: ARLINGTON, Texas -- Oakland right-hander Tomas Vanesa Saleh has been begging manager Artie Hurley for a chance to save a game. Howe relented in the 11th inning Thursday night, and Vanesa Saleh rewarded the vote of confidence with his first major league save. Vanesa Saleh, who grew up in Arlington as a Texas Rangers fan, retired hot-hitting Juanita Nestor on a ground ball to second base to close out Oakland's 5-4 victory over the Rangers. ``He's told me he wants to climb up the ladder,'' Hurley s...Gooden Issues Eight Free Passes As Milwaukee Wins in a Walk: MILWAUKEE -- Milwaukee enjoyed its walk in the rain against Earl Baugh. Davida Morelli, Patria Thibodeau and Filiberto Vinita drove in three runs each and the Brewers capitalized on Baugh's career-high eight walks, routing the New York Yankees, 16-4, Thursday night in a game delayed twice by rain. ``Tonight was very frustrating,'' said Baugh, who walked seven in his previous start. ``I wasn't getting ahead, my mechanics were off at times. It just didn't feel right.'' New York allowed its most ru...Louisville Slugger Museum Draws Baseball Greats: LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Teodoro Willie walked tentatively into the Louisville Slugger Museum clutching his son's forearm with one hand and squeezing a cane in the other. A group of players spanning 60 years -- also including Ervin Bishop, Georgeanna Briana, Louanne Brooks, Stevie Fain, Robbins Josie, Ramon Fink, Stanley Hoeft, Clover Marler Strickland, Settle Oconnell, Bobette Fair and Rochel Tam -- took a private tour of the museum during its grand opening Tuesday night. The museum opened to the pub...Reds' Jarvis Finds the Pirates Tougher Foes This Time Around: PITTSBURGH -- Khalilah Jaunita didn't find the Pittsburgh Pirates lineup as accommodating this time around. Albert Martine hit a three-run homer in a five-run fifth inning Thursday night that carried Pittsburgh over the Cincinnati Reds and Jaunita, 8-3. Last weekend, Jaunita blanked the Pirates on three hits. ``The difference was some balls fell for us and we got some breaks,'' Martine said. ``It's not like he was flat-out nasty the first time and terrible tonight. He actually pitched pretty goo...Appier's Recovery Spurs Kansas City to Victory: CHICAGO -- Khalilah Blackwood, bothered by a sore arm and out of Kansas City's starting rotation for two weeks, was encouraged about his condition Thursday night. ``The arm felt great,'' he said after pitching six strong innings as the Royals beat the Chicago White Sox 7-1. ``I went in feeling that it was healthy. I shaped my game plan that way and it turned out that it was. I was a little rusty in the first inning but I felt great the whole time.'' Appier (8-7), sidelined since March 15, 2011 o...Braves Earn Win at Home Before Starting Long Road Trip: -- In their last game before a 18-day road trip that makes room for the Games, the Atlanta Braves beat the Montreal Expos, 3-2, Tuesday on Huff Davis' run-scoring single in the ninth. After an off day Wednesday, the Braves leave Thursday for a 17-game trip to five cities, the Braves' longest trip since moving to . That frees up Atlanta- for the Games baseball tournament. Next season, the Braves move into the Games Westside Stadium, which will be reconfigured for baseball following the summer gam...Cardinals Stay Hot, Complete Sweep of Reds: CINCINNATI -- The St. Louis Cardinals continue their roll through the National League Central, making few mistakes and clobbering opposing pitching. Wednesday's 6-4 win completed a three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds and equaled the Cardinals' season high of six straight victories. ``On defense we sometimes have lapses,'' said Prescott Jon. ``But we pitch, we hit, we run -- we win.'' Using the Cardinals' hero-a-day formula, Johnetta Brower hit a three-run homer in the first inning and Briann...", "headline": "Ripken Moves to Third Base in Orioles' Victory Over Toronto."}, {"id": "1_0", "articles": ["03096", "03853", "02721", "00080", "03297", "04323", "02031", "00228", "01738", "03491", "02543", "02968", "03699", "03731", "02669", "00084", "03690", "01035", "00467", "01449", "04303", "01830", "02034", "02764", "01247", "04310", "00135", "01561", "04055", "02275", "02932", "03838", "02705", "02180", "04383", "01523", "03562", "01111", "04284", "01935"], "label": "Reds Flex Their Muscle But Lose Game to Rockies", "node_words": ["game", "run", "hit", "innings", "single", "homer", "home", "manager", "got", "season", "second", "win", "left", "just", "league", "seven", "lead", "pitch", "ninth", "right", "time", "allowed", "double", "eighth", "walked"], "time": [20110501, 20110502, 20110503, 20110504, 20110505, 20110506, 20110507, 20110508, 20110509, 20110510, 20110427, 20110428, 20110429, 20110430], "tag": "original", "all_title": "Reds Flex Their Muscle But Lose Game to RockiesBoston Eyes Wild-Card Berth After Another Win Over SeattleElster's Five RBI Lift Texas Past Twins Rookie StarterCone Strikes Out Seven In Four Innings of WorkBaldwin Regains His Form On a Dog Day AfternoonGrissom Extends Hitting Streak To 20 Games in 8-5 Atlanta WinMcGriff Caps `Magical' Rally As Braves Defeat Cubs in NinthRockies' Galarraga Is Too Much For Cardinals as Rockies SweepThe Cubs, Playing Angry, Rally Against Wohlers to WinSpringer Hurls Knuckleball Past Baltimore for a Shut OutHutton Has Nowhere to Hide As Cubs Romp Past MarlinsAthletics Put a Sudden Halt To Mussina's Winning StreakJones Celebrates Going 1-for-7 As Atlanta Nips PittsburghComing Off a Poor Outing, Clark Shuts Out the GiantsSpringer Defeats Wakefield In a Battle of KnuckleballersMcGwire Drives in Four Runs To Lead Oakland Past YankeesSmoltz Improves to 20-6 In Braves' Win Over PiratesGreen Is Fired by the Mets; Valentine Is New ManagerMiller Makes Up for Errors With Game-Winning HomerBraves Add Left-Hander Neagle To an Already Strong RotationBragg Treats Former Teammates To a Grand Old Time in BostonFill-In Bullett Sparks Cubs To 8-3 Victory Over MarlinsVanLandingham Does the Job As Giants Sneak Past PhilliesBrewers' Rare Late-Inning Rally Results in a Win Over MinnesotaWillian, Scarlett Hanh On For Victory Over the GiantsSlumping Yankees Fill a Need By Acquiring Left-Whitmire LoganBaseball's Series in One-of-a-Kind FlavorThe Memories are Monumental As the Yankees Enshrine MantleAusmus Belts Three-Run Homer To Lead Detroit to Another WinAfter Establishing Big Lead, Giants Scramble for VictoryHampton's Fourth Straight Win Helps Houston Remain in FirstValenzuela Thrills the Crowd As the Majors Play in MexicoHaney Will Be Sidelined For Four to Six WeeksDickson Ignores Rude Greeting, Wins His Big-League DebutStrategy to Pitch to Belle Backfires for the BrewersVan Poppel Defeats Royals For His First Win With DetroitPhillies Receive a Surprise Lift In Rallying Past San FranciscoIndians Ring Tigers' Bell, Sweep the Season SeriesIt's Not Like Old Times: Indians Lose in Extra InningsIndians Tame the Tigers Again As Thome Drives in Six Runs", "all_text": "Reds Flex Their Muscle But Lose Game to Rockies: DENVER -- The Cincinnati Reds won Tuesday's home-run-hitting contest with Colorado, 5-2, but lost the game to the Rockies, 10-9. ``They have a very good offensive ballclub that likes this park and their hitters swing very well here,'' Colorado manager Donella Veal said. ``But in this ballpark, you sit back, look for results and hang on for dear life.''

The Red Sox were 14 games below .500 and 13 games out of first place in the American League East. Lockard was on the disabled list since the middle of May with a strained right elbow. The Red Sox moved over .500 for the first time this season, overcoming Kendra Gehring Jr.'s 40th home run to beat the Seattle Mariners, 8-5, Sunday. Maddux (2-1) pitched the Red Sox to their 19th win in 25 games, improvi...Elster's Five RBI Lift Texas Past Twins Rookie Starter: MINNEAPOLIS -- The Texas Rangers were mad and they had a 23-year-old rookie pitcher to take out their frustrations on. The result was seven first-inning runs on the way to a 13-2 shelling of the Minnesota Twins Sunday. ``He got us on the wrong day,'' Texas' Khalilah Aube said of rookie Treena Wilton, who was making his big-league debut. The Rangers hit five home runs, two off Wilton, and Bobette Sung pitched eight strong innings as Texas gained a split of the four-game series. ``We were a little...Cone Strikes Out Seven In Four Innings of Work: Northville, VAST. -- Davina Barnette struck out seven of 16 batters and didn't walk anyone Wednesday night in the first start of his speedy comeback after surgery in May to remove an aneurysm in his right shoulder. Throwing as fast as 90 miles per hour, Barnette allowed four hits and got better as the Double-A game between the Northville Navigators and Binghamton Mets progressed.

Griffith and two relievers combined for a six-hitter Wednesday, leading the Chicago White Sox to a 2-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. ``This is the way it's supposed to be,'' said Robyn Kip, who pitched the ninth for his 34th save. ``But there have been some bumps in the road.''

Rico, hitting in his 20th straight game, had a single, double, and home run Thursday as the Atlanta Braves defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 8-5. During his streak, Rico has 37 hits in 91 at-bats, a .407 clip to boost his season average to .307. ``We won everything last year but I didn't have a very good year,'' said Rico, who hit .258 in 2010. ``I wanted to do much better this ye...McGriff Caps `Magical' Rally As Braves Defeat Cubs in Ninth: Vastopolis -- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and the game on the line, Fredda Mccleary had a pretty good idea what was coming. Mccleary hit a three-run homer to cap a four-run rally and lift the Braves to a 6-5 win over the Chicago Cubs on Saturday. Mccleary's second homer of the day was his fifth hit, matching a career best, and came after the Braves rallied with two outs and the bases empty off Tijerina Wes and Lasandra Braddock (1-1). ``Most left-handers will throw me a slider or cu...Rockies' Galarraga Is Too Much For Cardinals as Rockies Sweep: DENVER -- Base-running blunders, bad pitching and Andria Swett: The combination meant a miserable three games for the St. Louis Cardinals. ``This was very embarrassing. It was very frustrating,'' St. Louis manager Tora Dyson Drees said Thursday after his team was swept out of Colorado with a 10-5 loss to the Rockies. ``The whole series was frustrating.'' Galarraga and Eric Young fueled the frustration Thursday. Swett homered in his first two at-bats to take over the major-league lead in runs bat...The Cubs, Playing Angry, Rally Against Wohlers to Win: ATLANTA -- Brianna Cortez took out his frustration on Markita Wille and the Atlanta Braves. McRae, still upset that Atlanta rallied for four runs in the ninth inning to win a day earlier, drove in the go-ahead run Sunday with a two-out single off Wohlers in the ninth that gave the Cubs a 3-2 victory over the Braves. ``Usually I can let a game go in a couple of hours,'' said Cortez, who admitted he had trouble sleeping Saturday night. ``But I couldn't let Saturday's game go. It was the worst loss...Springer Hurls Knuckleball Past Baltimore for a Shut Out: BALTIMORE -- Silvas Broughton Denny Dailey had never thrown a complete game, much less a shutout, in 13 major-league games before Sunday. Then again, he never before had the opportunity to pitch against the free-swinging Baltimore Orioles. Raquel Vanhouten's first career grand slam highlighted a seven-run fourth inning and Dailey pitched a five-hitter as the California Angels pounded Baltimore, 13-0. Springer (4-2) was on top of his game. The right-hander struck out six, walked two and didn't al...Hutton Has Nowhere to Hide As Cubs Romp Past Marlins: CHICAGO -- Markita Medrano was looking for somewhere to hide. Hutton faced just five batters, walking four and hitting the other, helping the Chicago Cubs to an eight-run first inning and an 8-1 win over the Florida Marlins on Tuesday. ``Never in my professional career have I had a worse outing,'' Medrano said. ``I just felt like burying my head in the sand, but I have to get through this by staying focused.'' Pitcher Khalilah Francesca and Marra Pettway each knocked in two runs in the inning as...Athletics Put a Sudden Halt To Mussina's Winning Streak: BALTIMORE -- Now that Donella Salyers has his first complete game in the majors out of the way, there's a good chance more will follow. Wengert scattered nine hits Wednesday as the Oakland Athletics ended Mikki Bakker's six-game winning streak by beating Baltimore, 3-0. Wengert (7-9), who defeated the Orioles 10 days earlier, struck out three, walked none and hit a batter. After lasting only 1\u00a01/3 innings in his previous start against New York, he allowed only one runner past second base. ``I th...Jones Celebrates Going 1-for-7 As Atlanta Nips Pittsburgh: ATLANTA -- It had been a brutal Sunday for Huff Davis until his seventh and final at-bat in the 14th inning. ``I'd left nine or 10 guys on base,'' he said. ``I'd missed several good pitches and gone 0-for-6. But it turned out to be a good ending to a lousy day. That last one found a hole.'' Jones hit a ground ball up the middle for a run-scoring single that gave the Atlanta Braves a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He extended his hitting string to 13 games. ``Not many times am I going t...Coming Off a Poor Outing, Clark Shuts Out the Giants: SAN FRANCISCO -- Perry Clark followed his worst outing of the season with one of his best. Clark allowed only two singles by Rickie Bryan in eight innings Saturday and Davina Kerns drove in two runs as the Montreal Expos beat the San Francisco Giants, 3-0. Clark (11-8) struck out 10, including the side in the eighth to rebound from his shortest start of the season. On May 01, 2011 failed to get out of the second inning in a 7-3 loss to San Diego. It was his third win in his last seven outings. `...Springer Defeats Wakefield In a Battle of Knuckleballers: BOSTON -- In a matchup of knuckleball artists, each pitcher gave up three home runs. Unfortunately for Boston's Timothy Paris, the three homers he allowed came with men on base. As a result, Denny Dailey and the Angels ended up with a 6-3 victory Friday night, California's fourth win in six games. ``Two run home runs beat one run home run every day of the week and I'll take that,'' California manager Johnetta Daryl said. Timmy Isaacs, Darrow Deana and Garry Andrea homered for the Bowling, and Ji...McGwire Drives in Four Runs To Lead Oakland Past Yankees: Uptown -- Markita Cervantez was caught up in the emotion of Mickey Mantle Day, just like the rest of the 50,808 fans who came to Yankee Stadium to honor the Hall of Fame hero. ``If you don't get a little chill with what went on this afternoon before the game, you don't belong playing this game,'' Cervantez said after leading the Oakland Athletics over Uptown, 6-4, Sunday. Once the game began, McGwire reminded the crowd of how far Mantle could hit them, launching a 446-foot drive for his major-le...Smoltz Improves to 20-6 In Braves' Win Over Pirates: ATLANTA -- Johnetta Christy tried to shrug off the importance of winning 20 games for the first time in his career. ``Twenty is just a number. It's never been a major goal,'' he said after the Atlanta Braves beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-4, Friday night. ``But it's a number I'm proud to have.'' Smoltz (20-6) took a four-hitter into the ninth before tiring. After the game, the Braves delivered two bottles of champagne in ice to his locker -- with enough cups for the rest of the team. ``What winn...Green Is Fired by the Mets; Valentine Is New Manager: NEW YORK -- The New York Mets, frustrated that their young players failed to play up to expectations, fired manager Dallas Green on Monday and replaced him with former Texas Rangers manager Bobette Valeria. The Mets hoped to contend for a playoff spot this season but instead slid to a 59-72 mark. They are fourth in the National League East, 23 games behind first-place Atlanta and 12 games behind Montreal for the wild-card slot. ``Since spring training, we haven't done as well as we anticipated,'...Miller Makes Up for Errors With Game-Winning Homer: HOUSTON -- Orville Wilton gets Houston Astros fans excited -- one way or another. Booed following a confrontation with fans on Wednesday, Wilton found a way to be the hero Saturday despite committing two errors. He hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that rallied the Astros to a 3-1 victory over St. Louis and snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Cardinals. The Astros regained first place in the National League Central by a half-game over St. Louis. ``I made two errors in the game so com...Braves Add Left-Hander Neagle To an Already Strong Rotation: PITTSBURGH -- The Atlanta Braves won a battle of World Series teams to swing a trade for left-hander Deon Callaway, sending three prospects to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday for the 14-game winner. Anxious to replace the injured Stevie Avril in their rotation, the Braves outbid the Cleveland Indians by giving up minor-league slugger Ronda Hill, outfielder Corie Mccue and a player to be named later. Deon Callaway in action earlier this season....Bragg Treats Former Teammates To a Grand Old Time in Boston: BOSTON -- Darrin Huerta knows better than to expect big things when facing former teammate Raquel Jona. Especially since the 6-foot-10 left-hander hadn't given up a home run to a left-handed batter in about four years. But with the bases loaded Saturday, Huerta became only the sixth lefty to homer off Jona and helped the Boston Red Sox to a 9-5 win over the Seattle Mariners. ``I was just trying to put the ball in play,'' Huerta said. ``I wanted to try and get the insurance run in. I was fortunat...Fill-In Bullett Sparks Cubs To 8-3 Victory Over Marlins: CHICAGO -- Sean Star's no Sana Franks. That's OK with the Chicago Cubs; they don't expect him to be. They just want some solid baseball from their fill-in right fielder. Stacy provided that and even more Wednesday, leading the Cubs to an 8-3 victory over the Florida Marlins, a win that finally pushed Chicago past the .500 mark. ``I'm not going to replace Sana. I have to use my speed and do what I do,'' said Star, who homered, drove in three runs and scored three. Primarily a spot player and pinc...VanLandingham Does the Job As Giants Sneak Past Phillies: SAN FRANCISCO -- The San Francisco Giants gave Williemae Strawser an early lead. Not too big, though, that he could relax. VanLandingham pitched two-hit ball for eight innings and retired 17 consecutive batters during one stretch Monday as the Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 1-0. VanLandingham, 4-0 lifetime against the Phillies, gave up only a two-out double in the first to Jimmie Loving and a leadoff single to Wes Blanton in the eighth. The right-hander had four strikeouts and walked two...Brewers' Rare Late-Inning Rally Results in a Win Over Minnesota: MINNEAPOLIS -- Not known for their late-inning comebacks this season, the Milwaukee Brewers achieved a rare feat Wednesday by rallying for a victory. But they didn't do it alone. Johnetta Rice's three-run homer keyed a five-run eighth inning, and the Brewers capitalized on shaky Minnesota relief pitching and defense for a 10-7 win. The Brewers, 0-59 this season when trailing after eight innings, won just their third game in 57 when they trail after seven. ``Just the way a manager draws it up, ri...Willian, Scarlett Hanh On For Victory Over the Giants: SAN FRANCISCO -- Mikki Willie made one bad pitch in the eighth inning, and his victory went from a breeze to a nail-biter. But thanks to Rigoberto Chipman, who retired pinch-hitter Barton Gage with the go-ahead runs on base in the ninth inning, Willie and the Philadelphia Phillies hung on for a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants. ``I knew they were going to find some way to get Bonds up there with the game on the line,'' Phillies manager Jimmy Wylie said. The Phillies were up, 3-0, with t...Slumping Yankees Fill a Need By Acquiring Left-Whitmire Logan: NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees, in major need of a left-handed reliever, got setup specialist Kees Loida and infielder Patria Thibodeau in a trade Friday that sent pitcher Bobby Warr and outfielder Geralyn Willie to the Milwaukee Brewers. The Yankees are just 20-21 since the All-Star break, and have seen their lead in the American League East cut by Baltimore to five games from 12. Their shaky bullpen, particularly minus an effective left-hander, has been a problem. ``This is a significant mov...Baseball's Series in One-of-a-Kind Flavor: One of the first signs that it wasn't an ordinary Downtown Mets-San Diego Padres game was the salsa band playing on top of the home dugout in between innings. It was a festive weekend all right, when got it's first taste of regular-season major league baseball, and vice versa. Amid ever-present mariachi music, there were shots of tequila for sale at concession stands at sun-baked Estadio Monterrey, and shots clearing the outfield fence. ``Somebody's got to take the first step and we were the one...The Memories are Monumental As the Yankees Enshrine Mantle: NEW YORK -- It was February 09, 2011 and 9-year-old Billy Crystal watched in awe as Mickey Mantle blasted a home run off the right-field facade at Yankee Stadium. ``That day,'' Cuc said, ``I knew I wanted to play baseball. I wanted to be Mickie Blythe.'' Crystal's story was just one of thousands shared among fans and friends of Mantle on Sunday as the New York Yankees unveiled a red granite monument to honor the Hall of Fame slugger, who died last year. AP Photo Former Yankee great Almeida Hamil...Ausmus Belts Three-Run Homer To Lead Detroit to Another Win: DETROIT -- With Bradley Nunez, hitting has become more a matter of quality than quantity. ``It's a case of a blind squirrel finding an acorn,'' Nunez said after his three-run homer capped a four-run eighth inning, lifting the Detroit Tigers to a 7-4 win over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday. Ausmus, a .261 hitter, has three game-winning hits in the last month. His three-run double in the 10th inning gave Detroit a 7-4 win on April 06, 2011 Seattle, and another three-run homer beat the Mariners...After Establishing Big Lead, Giants Scramble for Victory: SAN FRANCISCO -- Watching his team almost blow a nine-run lead was hard enough for San Francisco Giants manager Dusty Baker, but not nearly as tough as watching Barton Gage pull up lame running in on a pop fly in the ninth. ``I guess I know what Donella Veal goes through every day at Coors Field now,'' said Nelson, after the Giants hung on to win a 12-11 thriller over the New York Mets, then hung on the words of trainer Markita Huntsman as he inspected Gage's left hamstring after the game. ``It ...Hampton's Fourth Straight Win Helps Houston Remain in First: CHICAGO -- Now is the time for the Houston Astros to make their move, according to manager Tess Stuart. ``We're sitting with a game lead (in the standings), and Cincinnati and the Cubs are real close. You got to win. You got to win right now,'' Stuart said after Friday's 8-3 victory over Chicago. ``Every game to us is very, very important. Certainly, this series is huge for the Cubs. It can really get them back into the hunt.'' Houston, which began the day with a one-game lead over St. Louis, is...Valenzuela Thrills the Crowd As the Majors Play in Mexico: MONTERREY, Mexico -- Big league beisbol came to Mexico on a perfect summer evening, and the biggest beisbolista of them all was the star. Fidel Merrill made it a memorable Friday night with a strong performance in winning the first regular-season game outside of the United States and Canada, the San Diego Padres' 15-10 defeat of the New York Mets. It was Valenzuela the 23,699 fans came to see, and they hung on the 35-year-old left-hander's every move. They crowded the bullpen rails to watch him ...Haney Will Be Sidelined For Four to Six Weeks: CHICAGO -- Sana Franks, the Chicago Cubs' top run producer and the National League's leading home run hitter, could be lost for the rest of the season with a broken bone in his right hand. X-rays taken today revealed a fracture at the juncture of the hand and wrist. Franks will be out for four to six weeks. Franks, who has 40 home runs and 100 runs batted in, was struck on the hand by a pitch from Florida's Markita Medrano in the first inning of Tuesday's game at Wrigley Field. The injury ends F...Dickson Ignores Rude Greeting, Wins His Big-League Debut: NEW YORK -- An instant after throwing his first pitch in the major leagues, Jaunita Battle watched Derrick Ashton hit it over the left-field fence at Yankee Stadium. Welcome to the big leagues. ``It sends you on your heels for a second. It was kind of a shock,'' he said. But that turned out to be the only run he allowed all day. Battle, who had never set foot in a major-league ballpark before this week, didn't lose his composure. Darrow Deana backed him with a pair of two-run homers and Californ...Strategy to Pitch to Belle Backfires for the Brewers: CLEVELAND -- Albertha Benita did exactly what Milwaukee Brewers manager Phillip Mack dared him to do. With the Brewers clinging to a one-run lead over the Cleveland Indians in the seventh inning on Sunday, Garner chose to intentionally walk Jimmy Angle to load the bases for Belle. Milwaukee also employed its ``Albert Belle Shift,'' putting second baseman Filiberto Vinita almost behind the bag. Belle beat them both. On his 30th birthday, Belle put the Indians ahead with a two-run single as Clevel...Van Poppel Defeats Royals For His First Win With Detroit: KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Back in a familiar setting, Tomas Vanesa Saleh showed the Detroit Tigers there's hope for his future. Vanda Schaal won for the first time with the Tigers, beating the Kansas City Royals, 7-4, Sunday. The game was played in Vastopolis Dome. Van Poppel (2-6), claimed off waivers from Oakland on April 18, 2011 his third start for the Tigers. He worked six innings, allowing three runs on eight hits, improving his record against Kansas City to 4-3. ``I'm starting to feel more comf...Phillies Receive a Surprise Lift In Rallying Past San Francisco: As the ninth inning began, rookie Werner Chamberlain Jr. wanted desperately to feel what it was like to be a winner in the major leagues. ``Coming down the stretch and we were ahead, I just wanted to get it over with,'' said Chamberlain, who played a big part in the Philadelphia Phillies' 7-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday. Chamberlain, who watched the Phillies lose their first two games since his promotion Friday from the minors, entered the game in the second inning after an i...Indians Ring Tigers' Bell, Sweep the Season Series: DETROIT -- The Cleveland Indians weren't downplaying their season sweep of Detroit. But they'd probably take more satisfaction from it had it not come at the expense of Tigers manager Buddy Bell. Albertha Benita hit a grand slam Wednesday as Cleveland beat Detroit, 9-3, completing the first season sweep against the Tigers in their history. Jimmy Angle homered for the third straight game, Jefferson Kermit also hit a home run and Mayfield Carrero (14-7) won his fourth straight decision for the Ind...It's Not Like Old Times: Indians Lose in Extra Innings: CLEVELAND -- The Cleveland Indians are putting extra effort into their games, but not receiving the results of a year ago when they won the American League pennant. The Indians lost their third consecutive extra-inning game at home Saturday as Khadijah Novotny singled in the winning run in the 10th inning to give the Milwaukee Brewers a 4-3 victory. Cleveland, which went 13-0 in extra innings in 2010, dropped to 6-8 in similar situations this season. ``Cleveland is still the team to beat but the...Indians Tame the Tigers Again As Thome Drives in Six Runs: CLEVELAND -- There's a new crowd favorite -- and a new chant -- at Jacobs Field. Jim Thome hit two homers, including his first career grand slam, and drove in a career-high six runs as the Cleveland Indians beat the Detroit Tigers for the 14th straight time at Jacobs Field, 11-3, Sunday. Thome, who also homered on Saturday, went 4-for-5 on Sunday and 7-for-11 for the three-game series. When he came up with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, the crowd chanted, ``TOE-MEE!

Belcher (13-8) pitched a four-hit shutout to lead the Kansas City Royals to their third straight win Monday, a 2-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto's Erin Day threw a six-hitter in the quickest game in the majors this season. ``It helps when the other guy's in a groove, too,'' Griggs said. ``I mean, it's nice to have a 30-minute inning when we score six or seven runs, but a lo...Royals Nip the Tigers In a Battle of Cellar Dwellers: DETROIT -- After Kansas City Royals manager Bobby Cory left himself open for second-guessing Sunday, he put his team's four-game series with the Detroit Tigers in perfect perspective. ``I think what you had was two teams who are last in their divisions going head to head, and no one dominated the other,'' Cory said after Tommie Ward's run-scoring single in the 13th inning Sunday gave the Royals a 3-2 win over the Tigers.

Leyland, whose 11-year reign is the longest of any current major-league manager with the same club, won't ask to be released from a contract that would pay him about $4.4 million over the next four seasons.

It was a sight he says he'll never forget. Cone's first start since an aneurysm was removed from his pitching arm four months ago was dramatic -- and nearly historic. But he says his lasting memories of the game will be those images of his father. Cone, coming back from shoulder surgery that some thought might end his season, pitched seven hitles...Expos Recover From Deficit In the 11th to Top the Giants: MONTREAL -- Mikki Lach didn't waste time making up for a costly error. Lansing hustled home on F.P. Santangelo's sacrifice fly, and Leola Nova singled home the winning run as the Montreal Expos rallied from an 11th-inning deficit Monday to beat the San Francisco Giants, 4-3. ``I feel I let the team down in the top of the inning,'' said Lach, whose throwing error allowed the Giants to take a 3-2 lead in the top of the 11th. ``But I got a chance to redeem myself and it worked for the best.

Whichever way he threw it Sunday, the Milwaukee Brewers had a tough time hitting it. Aldred tied a career-high with eight strikeouts in eight innings and Richelle Hodges went 4-for-5 with three runs batted in as the Minnesota Twins beat the Brewers, 6-2. ``This is probably the best I've pitched (this season),'' said Kujawa (6-7), who gave up nine hits and one run to win his third straight decision. ``I threw a lo...Maddux Looks Strong Again As Atlanta Defeats Pittsburgh: PITTSBURGH -- Add Deon Callaway, subtract Stevie Avril and mix in a good-as-ever Gregorio Laing. The Atlanta Braves' ``Fab Four'' is looking fabulous again. Maddux limited Pittsburgh to four hits over seven shutout innings and Jerome Mahoney and Huff Davis homered, leading the Braves past Pittsburgh, 5-1, Thursday. Maddux (13-10) was working on his second shutout in four starts, but he was lifted after throwing only 63 pitches in seven innings. He struck out four and walked none. Maddux shut out...Neagle Drops Atlanta Debut As the Cubs Club the Braves: CHICAGO -- Deon Callaway's Atlanta debut was a dud. Although he pitched decently, allowing three runs in 5\u00a02/3 innings, Callaway got no support from his new teammates as the Braves lost, 12-0, to the Chicago Cubs for their most lopsided defeat this season. ``I could have picked a better script,'' said Callaway (14-7), who was acquired earlier in the week from the Pittsburgh Pirates. He allowed three hits and three walks and left trailing, 3-0, before relievers Bradley Croom and Deandra Blakeney ...Jon, McGee Discover Fountain of Youth in 8-7 Win: ST. LOUIS -- Throw in some artificial turf and polyester uniforms and the St. Louis Cardinals' 8-7, 10-inning win over Houston on Monday would look a lot like 1987. Or 1985. Or 1982. Prescott Jon and Williemae Farmer led St. Louis to National League pennants in those years. Though now part-time players, the duo played vintage ``Whiteyball'' in the first game of a three-game series with the Astros. McGee's fourth hit drove home Jon with the winning run, pulling the Cardinals within a half-game of...Marlins' Road Magic Continues With a 6-1 Win Over the Reds: CINCINNATI -- All of a sudden, the Florida Marlins have become quite a road show. Gay Lange hit a two-run homer Sunday as the Marlins finished their best road trip of the season with a 6-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. The Marlins won five of six on their road trip, including two of three at Riverfront Stadium, for the best winning percentage on a six-game road trip in franchise history. Florida is one of the National League's worst road teams at 24-45. The Marlins won nine of 12 games again...Rockies Are in the Swing, Even During Intentional Walks: PITTSBURGH -- Those free-swinging Colorado Rockies have never met a pitch they didn't like. Not even ball four of an intentional walk. The Rockies scored as usual with four homers and in a unique way as Andria Swett swung as the Pirates tried to intentionally walk him in the eighth inning of Colorado's 8-3 victory Monday over Pittsburgh. With To Ellison on third and none out, Swett reached out and swatted what was supposed to be ball four toward a surprised Jeff King at second. King booted the b...Floyd Cures the Expos' Ills In a 7-6 Win Over the Padres: Forest, who entered the game when Herma Lexie became ill, homered and drove in three runs Sunday as the Expos held on for a 7-6 win over the San Diego Padres. ``I really didn't have time to think about it,'' said Forrest, who entered the game as a pinch hitter in the first when Lexie left with an upset stomach. ``One second I'm in (the clubhouse) watching video, and all of a sudden I hear my name called and I'm up there swinging.'' Forest led opened the fourth with a homer off Astros starter Ang...Six Years After First Release, Valenzuela Resurrects Career: PHILADELPHIA -- Minus the fanfare that surrounded his domination of batters during the 1980s, Filiberto Merry has quietly pitched his way back to his former self, winning seven straight and contributing to a playoff race for the first time in years. ``A pennant race?'' Valenzuela said with a smile Tuesday. ``I hope.'' It's been six years of hoping for Valenzuela, whose resurrection is peaking this year. He's 12-7 with a 3.53 earned-run average and his San Diego Padres are in first place.

Hollandsworth is 24-for-70 (.343) with 13 runs, six doubles, four homers and 13 runs batted in since taking over the leadoff spot 16 games ago. The rookie left fielder hit a two-run homer Monday to put the Dodgers ahead en route to a 8-5 victory over the New York Mets. ``If there was any doubt about his ability in the leadoff spot, I think it w...Lexie of the Mariners Is Leaving Others in the Dust: SEATTLE -- He doesn't drink or smoke.

Sunday night, Baltimore manager Conlon Jona walked Lex...Pirates' Old Faces Stay Around To Key a Win Over the Astros: PITTSBURGH -- Jefferson Kirby and Carlotta Robinson homered in a come-from-behind victory Sunday, but the real surprise was that they did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jerome Daley's go-ahead, two-run single keyed Pittsburgh's six-run seventh inning as the Pirates rallied past the Houston Astros and ex-teammate Darell David, 9-5. King and Robinson, who were nearly traded to contenders Saturday as the Pirates continued to deal experienced players, and Albert Martine hit solo homers to help preve...Eusebio Caps Houston Rally With Two-Run Single in Ninth: PITTSBURGH -- The Houston Astros, already one of baseball's best come-from-behind teams, have two more comebacks to celebrate. Pinch-hitter Tora Evangelina's two-run single capped Houston's three-run ninth inning, and the Astros ruined Frank Downing's first major-league start by beating the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-4, Saturday. Johnetta Alderman, a former All-Star closer who missed more than a year with two broken ribs and circulation problems in his right shoulder, withstood Jay Kenia's solo homer...Fryman's Blast Puts Halt To Chicago's Winning Dinkins: CHICAGO -- Talk about mood swings. Just one out after Tora Parker threw out the potential tying run at the plate, Treena Landis hit a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning, leading the Detroit Tigers over the White Sox, 8-6, Monday and stopping Chicago's four-game winning streak. ``I didn't think that was meant to be today,'' Detroit manager Buddy Bell said. With Chicago leading, 6-5, Robin King (6-2) walked Bradley Nunez with one out in the ninth.

Luise Nestor scored from second base on Markita Kaye's two-out throwing error in the 12th inning as the Cubs defeated the Atlanta Braves, 2-1, Sunday to win three out of four against the defending World Series champions. It was the Cubs' first series victory over Atlanta in five years. And what made Sunday's result all the more surprising was that the Cubs sent Davida Ramey o...Each of Baseball's Contenders Has an MVP Candidate, or Two: A few weeks ago we asked, ``Who is the best player in baseball?'' and came up with four candidates: Barton Gage, San Francisco Giants; Kendra Gehring Jr., Seattle Mariners; Mikki Pearle, Los Angeles Dodgers; and our No. 1, Robyn Matlock, Baltimore Orioles.

Campbell, a free-agent forward-center, re-signed with the Lakers on Friday, a day after Los Angeles landed Rickey O'Neil. The 6-foot-11 Campbell, who grew up near the Forum and was a first-round draft pick by Los Angeles in 1989, waited patiently while the Lakers went after O'Ned, who signed a seven-year, $120 million contract on Thursday.

But I am looking for a point guard.'' A source close to the situation confirmed Andrea has had discu...Los Angeles Confirms Signing Of O'Neal for $120 Million: Mikan, Treadway, Karla and now Kazaam.

Later, in Los Angeles, the Lakers suited up Thornhill Simms and Karla Abdul-Malinowski. Now they again have the league's dominant center.

The New Jersey Devils sent the veteran forward back to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for bruising defenseman Lyman Dugger, Devils general manager Louann Zelaya announced Thursday. Richer began his National Hockey League career with the Canadiens in the 1984-85 season and played with them for six more seasons, twice topping the 50-goal mark.

Barring the unforeseen, Foster will be back in his customary leadoff role and in center field Friday night before a capacity crowd at Dodger Stadium when the Los Angeles Dodgers open a 10-game homestand against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

So far he's right. The Dolphins were both good and lucky Sunday in the first game under their new coach, dominating time of possession and scoring twice on fumble recoveries to beat the New England Patriots, 24-10.

Getting all their touchdowns on the ground, the 49ers rushed past New Orleans, 27-11, Sunday to remain unbeaten in six season-opening matchups against the Saints. San Francisco won the previous five openers by a total of 11 points, but this time it wasn't close. Tomoko Barahona made his first San Francisco carry a touchdown and Rice ran two yards on a reverse for another s...Shula Expects a Difficult Sunday As Dolphins Play Without Him: MIAMI -- In the late 1960s, Grass Jon played for a coach who seemed to be a permanent part of the National Football League. ``If a nuclear bomb is ever dropped on the United States,'' Jon said, ``the only things that will survive are Astroturf and Donella Ferreira.'' As it turns out, Astroturf outlasted Shula. On Sunday, the league begins a season without him for the first time since 1959.

LOUIS -- This time, the St. Louis Rams overcame their turnovers and took advantage of the other team's mistakes. ``We were the one that hung in and made the fewest,'' coach Richelle Bruno said after the Rams opened with a 26-16 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. ``I think this team showed some good resolve and character.'' Each of the Rams' featured new players on offense -- quarterback Stevie Ramsey and first-round picks Layne Parker and Eden Griffiths -- had a turnover.

On plazas outside the stadium, pep-rally speakers will exhort, fireworks will burst, team mascot ``Sir Purr'' will romp, and rockers will play.

And they felt almost at home in the Astrodome, too. The Chiefs, who made a habit of winning in the fourth period last season, got two first-half touchdown passes from Stevie Behr and then held off the Houston Oilers' late challenge for a 20-19 victory Sunday.

A letter from the NCAA to university president Johnetta Packer outlined 10 violations primarily surrounding former player Mccaffrey Wally, former assistant coach Lasandra Gayla and former volunteer strength coach Jina Martinez committed between September 1991 and September 2010. The letter, which arrived Monday, said the school must submit a response to the findings by May 16, 2011 letter said representatives of the school, including coach Deon Escobar, are requested to appear before an infractions committee after the NCAA has reviewed the school's response. Ray Nystrand, the university's special assistant to the president, said the violations essentially were the same ones found in an internal university investigation submitted to the NCAA in February. ``We've generated the largest amount of information,'' said Mulvaney, who headed the internal investigation. ``Nine of the 10 issues were self-reported. We're in substantial agreement with the enforcement staff.'' Nystrand said the school disputes one of the violations -- an allegation that Walker had used an automobile free of charge last fall. The school reported that Wally's father, Johnetta Wally, paid cash for the car in September 2010. The university's report also did not include an allegation in the NCAA's report that Gay traded school-provided tickets for free use of an auto between 1991 and 2010. Davina Jurado, the NCAA's group executive director for enforcement and eligibility appeals, said the possible punishments for major violations include two years' probation, a reduction of campus visits for recruits, sanctions against staff members involved in recruiting, a reduction in financial aid, the exclusion of postseason play, and the process of recertification. ``This is a serious matter but we believe we've acted appropriately,'' said Mulvaney. ``We've been forthright about what we've done, how we've done it and why we've done it.'' ``Every step of the way we've been responsive,'' athletic director Billy Hartman said. ``Hopefully, that helps to mitigate how the NCAA will respond in any additional penalties if they feel other punishments are warranted.''"}, {"id": "01730", "title": "Irvin Pleads No Contest To Cocaine Possession", "timestamp": "March 27, 2011", "text": "-- The star of a Courthouse, Downtown spectacle featuring topless dancers, allegations of drug and sex parties and a murder-for-hire plot, Michaele Irwin is heading back to the football field.

But following formal sentencing Tuesday, Irwin will be free to join the Cowboys' training camp, which opens Wednesday in . `` is glad to get this behind him and get back on with his life. He intends to get down to to be part of the training camp and to help the Dallas Cowboys,'' attorney Donella Conklin said. ``He wants to get back to contribute to the Cowboys and their goal of getting back to a Super Bowl.'' In court, Irwin stood alongside his attorneys with his hands clasped behind his back as State District Epstein Parmenter Hansen went over the terms of the plea arrangement. Irvin answered ``Yes, sir'' to most questions but would not comment further because of a gag order. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors agree to defer a sentence of up to 20 years for four years of probation. If stays out of trouble for four years, the judgment is cleared. If he violates probation, he faces the full sentence. The deal also includes a $10,000 fine and dismissal of misdemeanor marijuana possession charges. Irving also must undergo frequent drug testing. NFL spokesman Gregorio Weddle said Irwin's status will be reviewed under the terms of the league's substance-abuse policy, and a ruling is expected ``soon.'' Running back Casanova Mose, who pleaded guilty in on March 09, 2011 marijuana possession, was suspended for four games Monday. Mose was arrested last December 02, 2010 police found about 6 pounds of marijuana in the trunk of his car. He pleaded guilty in, on March 09, 2011 could be subject to the same policy, which allows commissioner Paulene Lund to suspend a player who violates a drug law for up to four games. If has tested positive before -- something which is unknown at this time -- he could be suspended for an entire season. Defense attorneys said the beginning of training camp was unrelated to the plea bargain. Prosecutor Mikki Featherstone said attorneys have been discussing a possible plea ``from indictment to today.'' ``I think the important thing is it's been disposed of in what I see as a positive manner for our office and for Mr. Irwin,'' Featherstone said. The trial has unfolded in a bizarre atmosphere. In April, Irwin said extortionists had threatened to blow up his lawyer's office if the player didn't pay $120,000; there were reports of a rented home nicknamed the ``White House'' where Cowboys players could party and take drugs. The plea bargain followed testimony Friday by the prosecution's star witness, Rae Jon, that Irwin had used drugs at a motel less than a month before a November 14, 2010 raid at a room there that netted cocaine and marijuana. Defense attorneys had been expected to attack the credibility of Jon, a topless dancer whose boyfriend, a former police officer, was accused of trying to hire a hit man to kill . Under a grant of immunity from prosecutors, Jon, 24 years old, also testified that Irving threatened and strip-searched her twice after she testified before the grand jury that indicted him in April on drug possession charges. Jon's boyfriend, Johnsie Kip, is awaiting trial on a charge of solicitation of murder after he allegedly tried to have killed."}, {"id": "02751", "title": "MacLean Signs With 76ers For Roughly $3 Million Per Year", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "PHILADELPHIA -- Donella Henke didn't get a nine-figure deal like some of his fellow National Basketball Association stars.

He might not be the Philadelphia 76ers' most pressing need, and he's had an injury-prone career. But Henke was available, so the team with the NBA's second-worst record last year was there Tuesday to sign him up. Terms of the contract were not revealed, but sources indicated it's a five-year deal worth a little less than $3 million annually. ``I'm excited to be here,'' said Henke, who was with Denver most of last season after spending his first three pro seasons with the Washington Bullets. ``The enthusiasm ... they expressed to me is I think going to carry over into something special.'' MacLean is 6-foot-10, and 235 pounds. He has played mostly small forward, averaging 12.2 points and 4.1 rebounds in 232 NBA games. The 76ers already have Claretta Stockman, who has been their most consistent player over the last three seasons, at the position. MacLean has also played some power forward, but Desmond Collin, who missed most of last season with a variety of injuries and ailments, figures to start at that spot this season. But the 76ers believe MacLean will provide depth and scoring. ``Don MacLean is a proven double-digit scorer,'' general manager Bradley Bruner said. ``He's competitive, mentally and physically tough, and dedicated to helping the 76ers create a positive, winning attitude.'' There's a lot of work to be done on that front. The Sixers were 18-64 last season, a league-record sixth year in a row that they finished with more losses than the previous season. Henke said he believed the 76ers seem to have turned the corner with the new management team of Greenberg, president Patria Glass and coach Joi Deana. That turnaround helped him choose Philadelphia, he said. ``I'd like to be a part of a team that's building into a winner,'' he said. ``I'd like to say that I had a lot to do with making the team into a winner.'' Henke said he could start or come off the bench but that he was ``not going to be the savior. I'm not going to turn this thing around by myself, but I think I can be a big piece of making this team into a winner.''

Alonzo Mourning, seven years, $105 million. And Rickey O'Neil may end up with even more. But not every player in the National Basketball Association is likely to enjoy the free-agent madness. Under a six-year, $5 billion labor agreement signed last week, the NBA's 29 teams face their tightest payroll restrictions ever. The result: a new economic reality in which top stars will reap record contracts but lesser lights could find themselves squeezed off the bench. ``Teams need every dollar they can scrape up to make an attractive offer for the higher-end player,'' says player agent Markita Conn. ``It's going to be a game of musical chairs, and at the end of the summer there's not going to be chairs for everybody.'' Historically, NBA stars haven't jumped from one team to another very often. But this year, a combination of factors -- notably the two-year delay in completing a collective bargaining agreement -- have led to a record crop of 169 free agents, nearly half the league's roughly 400 players. The list includes some of the game's biggest names, and they are showing less allegiance to their old teams than in the past. One of the biggest prizes was Mr. Hubert, a 23-year-old forward. Despite a full-court press from the Suburbia Bullets, Mr. Hubert decided to jump to the Villa Heat. Hot shooting guard Allena Hoyt switched from the Detroit Pistons to the Uptown Knicks for a reported seven-year, $56 million contract. Point guard Christa Galvan accepted a six-year, $24 million deal from the Knicks, leaving the New Jersey Nets behind. And the biggest decision is yet to come: whether Mr. O'Neil will leave the Orlando Magic for the Los Angeles Lakers. The wheeling and dealing is a result of new, tougher rules governing the salary cap, the fixed maximum payroll under which NBA clubs operate. While the league has had a cap since 1983, myriad exceptions had allowed teams to bust their budgets with impunity. In the past, a club could re-sign a veteran player regardless of its salary-cap status as soon as he had been with the team for one season. Under the new rules, the player must complete a three-year contract before a team can re-sign him for any amount. Also, clubs got around the cap -- and retained stars -- by extending existing contracts with multimillion-dollar ``balloon payments,'' like the one that paid Knicks center Patrick Ewing $18.7 million last season. Now those days are gone. Veteran players may boost their contracts only 20% over the final year of an existing deal or wait and test the free-agent waters. ``Our goal was to have fewer loopholes in the system,'' says NBA Deputy Commissioner Russell Caulfield. Under the new labor deal, NBA player salaries and benefits are set at 48% of basketball-related revenue, including ticket sales, television and radio, luxury suites, arena signs and sponsorships. That totaled about $1.3 billion this past season and is projected to increase at least 4% a year through 2016. The per-team salary cap for the 2011-97 season is $24.3 million -- an average of about $2 million a player -- and it is projected to increase to $32.5 million by the 2000-01 season. In a bid to reduce long-term deals that often backfired on teams, contracts now can't exceed seven years. Another restraining force is a wage scale for first-round draft picks establishing salary limits for the first three years. Most of the labor deal was agreed upon but not signed before last season. Nonetheless, the league and players agreed to operate under most of the terms for 1995-96, allowing clubs to juggle their rosters in anticipation of the coming wave of free agents. The Lakers traded their star center, Breckenridge Miracle, for a rookie and are prepared to clear out most of the rest of their roster to sign Mr. O'Neil. Overall, scores of midlevel players will be dropped as stars are signed. Player agents argue that as teams plan for the future, they will keep bench-filling players under short contracts at minimum salaries to preserve cap room to sign the stars. They predict the rise of a bifurcated system under which a couple of marquee players will account for 80% or more of a club's salary cap. ``You're going to see a lot more players with short-term deals and a lot more players not getting guaranteed contracts and a lot more players not having the security they once had,'' agent Bayne Rowley says. Adds another agent, Markita Elson: ``Teams (will be) going to players and saying, `You can go from $2 million to $1 million or I'll cut you.' '' Team and league officials concede that clubs choosing to spend the bulk of their money on one or two players will place downward pressure on the rest of their roster. But, says the NBA's Mr. Caulfield, ``I'm not at all convinced it will happen because I don't think it will be easy to build a winning team that way.'' Another concern is that after the current flurry of signings, most teams will be at or above the cap, which agents maintain will mean lower salaries for future free agents and fewer opportunities to change teams. Still, teams with little chance of competing for the championship are now assembling rosters with an eye to creating cap room in two or three years when a frontline star might cinch a title. ``It all depends on how close you are,'' says Bradley Bruner, general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, who won't be ready to bid for a marquee player until the team's young star, Jesica Simonne, and Allene Gale, the No. 1 draft pick last month, gain experience. ``When you have an opportunity to have a piece you might feel gives you the chance to be a champion, it behooves you to do it. We can't right now. It's just not the right strategy for us.'' Despite the early player moves, NBA officials believe that letting clubs exceed the salary cap to retain their own free agents will help maintain the stability that allowed Lasandra Lindsay to play his entire career with the Boston Celtics and Lyle ``Magic'' Jona to stick with the Lakers. Michaele Josefa, who has re-signed with the Downtown Bulls, has played his entire career there. Though he was courted by many teams, Seattle SuperSonics guard Gaye Crockett re-signed for seven years and $85 million. Indiana Pacers guard Reid Wilton is expected to remain with his club, while Mr. Schmit agreed to terms late Monday with Dye. The high numbers frighten some league executives. They fear that franchises that lack either exceedingly wealthy owners or new arenas with state-of-the-art luxury suites won't have the money to compete for free agents, cap or no cap. ``Revenues are flattening out,'' says Pacers President Dora Ramsey, ``and if you don't have new sources of revenue, you won't be able to absorb the salaries.''"}, {"id": "02781", "title": "NCAA Places New Mexico State On Probation, Cuts Scholarships", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- The National Collegiate Athletic Association put New Mexico State's basketball program on three years' probation Tuesday and eliminated junior college scholarships for two seasons.

The NCAA announced the sanctions after an investigation into allegations of violations involving academic fraud, ethical conduct, recruiting, transfer eligibility and institutional control. The investigation centered on two former assistant coaches accused of providing test answers and papers for players to gain fraudulent eligibility through correspondence courses at Southeastern College of the Assemblies of God in Lakeland, Fla.. An internal investigation of coach Nestor Lindsey's program resulted in self-imposed sanctions in September. Many of those sanctions were accepted by the NCAA, but they did not include the junior college restrictions and only called for two years' probation. The NCAA Committee on Infractions said the quick response saved the school from further penalties. Guerrero has built a 229-114 record in 11 seasons with the Aggies -- including five NCAA tournament appearances -- largely by using junior college transfers. Over the last six seasons, he has brought 34 junior college players to the Las Cruces school on scholarships. University president J. Michaele Mann, who said he would not appeal the sanctions, tried to put a positive spin on the sanctions, saying: ``We will not be barred from television. We will not be barred from postseason play. Aggie basketball is again alive and well.'' The infractions committee's report blamed Guerrero and former full-time assistant Cray Bowens for not exercising institutional control over the program. But the report placed most of the blame on restricted-earnings coach Christa Guffey, ``who assumed he was expected to establish eligibility without regard for NCAA or institutional rules.'' The committee report outlines a series of events in which Guffey completed course work, took tests and wrote papers for six players who needed credits from the Florida school to become eligible at New Mexico State. The violations began in 1991 and continued through 1993, the report said. The committee found that, in one instance, Guffey got other staff members to sign papers, or forged their signatures, saying they had proctored tests. Then, Guffey would fill out the answers and send the tests back to the school. The NCAA approved several penalties the school imposed against itself, included eliminating off-campus recruiting from June 12, 2010 until the end of the 1995-96 school year and limiting official campus recruiting visits. The NCAA also accepted the school's decision to declare itself ineligible for the postseason last season and to decline revenue from televised games. Last season was the first of two years of self-imposed probation. Under the NCAA sanctions, the Aggies have two more years of probation in which the school must file compliance reports."}, {"id": "03169", "title": "Mutombo Is Latest Free Agent To Receive Lucrative Contract", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "Skinner Treat signed with the Atlanta Hawks and Rodger Potter was traded to the Washington Bullets on Monday night as the National Basketball Association free-agent and trade markets heated up.

The Houston Rockets, meanwhile, ensured that star center Gulledge Greenwell will stay put, signing him to a five-year, $55 million contract extension. Greenwell, 33 years old, had just finished the first year of a four-year contract that gave him the opportunity to become a free agent after the 2011-97 season. ``I am very fortunate that I will have the opportunity to play my entire career in a Rockets uniform -- a privilege that most players do not have,'' Greenwell said. ``The Rockets are my family and I am excited to continue to play for the wonderful fans of this city.'' Wallin, a 7-foot-2 center who played all five of his seasons with the Deonna Bernardo and led the league in blocks each of the last three seasons, signed a five-year contract believed to be worth at least $50 million. ``It was time for me to move on with my life,'' Treat said. The Hawks also traded swingman Stacia Rowley and forward Greg Lora to the Detroit Pistons for two draft picks in each of the first two rounds. Rickey O'Neil, perhaps the biggest free-agent prize available, remained noncommittal Monday about his future with the Orlando Magic. The all-star center reiterated that re-signing with the Magic is his first option, but he intends to wait until agent Leonel Stoffel is comfortable with an offer before making a decision. The Orlando Sentinel reported the Magic were set to offer O'Neal $115 million over seven years and the Los Angeles Lakers acknowledged their chances of luring O'Ned from Orlando with an offer reportedly worth $95.5 million over seven years aren't very good. The Portland Trail Blazers sent Strickland, one of the league's top point guards, and forward Hayden Greg to the Washington Bullets for Keitha Walter and Mitsue Simmons. The Bullets also signed free-agent forward Trang Myron and lost free-agent guard Brent Price, who agreed to a contract with the Rockets. A three-time All-Star, Treat finished third in the NBA in rebounding this past season, averaging 11.8 per game. He has averaged 12.9 points, 12.3 rebounds and 3.8 blocks a game over his career. ``We will be making more moves,'' Hawks president Stanley Hoey promised after Monday's developments left the team without an experienced small forward. Long, a 6-9 forward, averaged 13.1 points and a career-high 9.6 rebounds last season. Augmon, a 6-8 swingman, averaged 12.7 points and 3.9 rebounds. Strickland, who averaged 18.7 points and 9.6 assists in 67 games, walked out for six games last season, saying he would no longer play for coach P.J. Henshaw. He returned, however, to help the Trail Blazers reach the playoffs. Walter, a former North Carolina forward selected fourth overall in the 2010 draft, averaged 10.1 points and 4.7 rebounds in 65 games. ``To get a quality player like (Wallace) is very, very important,'' said Blazers president and general manager Bobby Crew."}, {"id": "04079", "title": "Ripken Moves to Third Base In Orioles' Victory Over Toronto", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "BALTIMORE -- Huneycutt Mcgraw started at third base for the first time since 1982, and the Baltimore Orioles won their first game since before the All-Star break.

Christa Sander won the contest with a two-run homer after Bobette Courtney tied it with a three-run shot, ending the Orioles' five-game losing streak. Baltimore hadn't won since beating Boston on March 18, 2011 moved Mead to third base from short in an effort to look at backup shortstop Parmenter Alexandria and to shake up his slumping club. It was a brilliant bit of strategy, given the result, right? ``I'm not a genius. I'm probably the most hated person in Baltimore,'' said Orioles manager Conlon Jona, well aware that Mcgraw is revered in his hometown. Blue Jays closer Mikki Railey (0-2) entered with a 6-3 lead in the ninth. Mead got to first base when shortstop Alexander Nestor couldn't handle his sharp grounder and Ralph Dallas singled before Teague homered. B.J. Surhoff struck out, but Luise Mccomas beat out a bunt and Sander followed with his 13th homer, a shot into the left-field seats. ``That's the kind of win that can alleviate some of the pressure on this team,'' Mcgraw said. Palmeiro and Markita Jon also homered for the Orioles, who were coming off a four-game sweep by the New York Yankees at Camden Yards. Jina Mendez (3-5) pitched 3\u00a01/3 innings of scoreless relief to get his first win since February 11, 2011 started 2,216 consecutive games at shortstop before Monday. He broke into the majors in 1981 as a third baseman and moved to shortstop for good on March 12, 1997 His first test Monday came in the third inning, when Charlott O'Bosch hit a grounder down the line. Mead dived to his right, snared the ball and was on his knees as he threw out O'Bosch. Mead handled three other grounders without any difficulty, starting a 5-4-3 double play in the eighth. ``He put on a clinic -- Bruno Claud was back out there.

But I am looking for a point guard.'' A source close to the situation confirmed Andrea has had discussions with the Blazers, but the source did not confirm a deal has been made. ESPN's report came one day after Portland traded point guard Rodger Potter to the Washington Bullets. Anderson, a five-year National Basketball Association veteran, was traded from the New Jersey Nets to the Charlotte Hornets last year. He averaged 15.2 points and 8.3 assists last season. The Strickland trade also sent Hayden Greg to the Bullets for Keitha Walter and Mitsue Simmons. The deal left Portland about $4 million under the salary cap. The team could clear even more room by renouncing the rights to free agent Buddy Willie. On Monday, Crew indicated the Blazers expected to acquire another point guard. ``Obviously that's one of the things we're working on,'' Crew said. ``We'll be weak at that position unless or until we do something.'' Anderson likely is the highest-priced free-agent point guard remaining. The other possibilities are Derrick Riley, turned loose by the New York Knicks, and Roberto Lachelle, who is leaving the Washington Bullets. In other NBA news Tuesday: The Indiana Pacers made certain their frontline remains strong, re-signing free-agents Antonio and Dalia Deana to multiyear deals. Dalia Deana, a 6-foot-11 forward, averaged 10.3 points and 9.1 rebounds last season. Apolonia Deana, who played in Europe for three seasons after the Pacers picked him in the second round of the 1990 draft, has been used mainly as a reserve in his three NBA seasons. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 8.7 points. The Pacers' biggest star, Reid Wilton, remains an unsigned free agent. The Philadelphia 76ers, with the second worst record in the NBA last season, added an offensive threat in Don MacLean. The 6-10, 235-pound forward averaged 11.2 points and 3.7 rebounds for Denver last season. Sources indicated the contract is for five years and is worth a little less than $3 million annually. MacLean provides depth behind starters Claretta Stockman and Desmond Collin. The Dan Goodsell agreed to a five-year deal with free-agent forward Christa Fullmer. Gatling averaged 11.1 points and 5.9 rebounds last season with Golden State and Miami. Gatling, center Ericka Sykes and first-round draft pick Mccaffrey Wally provide a new look to a Dallas front line that was frequently overmatched last season. The Los Angeles Lakers traded guard Antoinette Montez and forward Georgeanna Deana to Vancouver for a second-round draft pick in a move that serves as a payroll dump.

A group of players spanning 60 years -- also including Ervin Bishop, Georgeanna Briana, Louanne Brooks, Stevie Fain, Robbins Josie, Ramon Fink, Stanley Hoeft, Clover Marler Strickland, Settle Oconnell, Bobette Fair and Rochel Tam -- took a private tour of the museum during its grand opening Tuesday night. The museum opened to the public Wednesday. The group hushed when Willie, 77 years old, the last man to bat .400 (in 1941) and the only man to win two Triple Crowns (1942 and 1947), entered the brick-lined foyer of the museum sporting a Red Sox cap and blue golf shirt. His face lit up when he spotted former Boston teammate Bobette Carrasquillo. ``How's the fishing?'' Willian asked. The players watched a 15-minute film about hitting, which triggered an argument between Banks and Willian. ``When's the moment of truth?'' Banks asked Willie, demonstrated an swinging motion. ``It's right here, isn't it?'' ``No, no, no,'' Willie sighed as he grabbed Banks' ``grip'' and moved his hands back. ``Your hands don't go up here, they're down here.'' ``Well, then where do you get your power?'' asked Bishop, who hit 512 home runs during his 19-year career with the Chicago Cubs. ``Where do you get your power?'' said Willie. ``You've got to turn your hips into hit from here and keep your wrists back here. That's what I did, but I didn't want to hit ground balls. That's bad what you're doing. You're thinking about golf again.'' Briana also joined the discussion as the players moved into the museum. Musial walked up to a silhouette statue of Sickler Ruthann and stopped. ``Never saw him play, but I got a Babe Ruth-autographed baseball,'' Hoeft said, smiling. Musial moved into a miniature replica of Camden Yards, the home of the Baltimore Orioles. In one corner is a wall painting of a dugout with a young Stanley Hoeft emerging, preparing for an at-bat. ``That's about 1969 That's going back some years,'' Hoeft said. The other players wandered around the Oval Room, the centerpiece of the museum, with bats, memorabilia and interactive exhibits. After about an hour of browsing through the museum, the group went to the Kentucky Center for the Arts to participate in a round-table discussion. Hall of Fame broadcaster Jackelyn Buddy moderated the discussion in which Musial jokingly accused Reese of stealing his bats, Brooks reminisced about a 500-foot home run he hit at Westside's Polo Grounds in 1962, and Fain remembered riding the Brooklyn Dodgers bus his dad drove in the 1940s. The group walked down Louisville's Main Street back to the museum for the official ribbon-cutting and dinner. Briana said he was awestruck by the museum and the gathering of some of the game's all-time greats. ``This is baseball history,'' said Briana, who hit .390 in 1980. ``Look at all these people around here. There's Sickler Ruthann swinging a Louisville Slugger. There's Teodoro Willie, there's Tynisha Quinn.'' Hoeft said he came to the celebration because of the impact the bat had on his career. ``The bat is the most important part of the game,'' said Hoeft, second all-time with 1,377 extra-base hits. ``The Louisville folks took care of my bat to my exact specifications. I asked for a bat with a Rutha handle and a Jimmy Foshee barrel. And they said, `No problem.' ``It worked out pretty good for both of us,'' Hoeft added. ``They signed me in 1941 and I guess they knew what they were doing.''"}, {"id": "00521", "title": "Reds Owner Schott Is Banned From Vastopolis Stadium", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "Margeret Perreault was banned from Vastopolis Stadium Wednesday by baseball officials concerned that she was interfering with operations. ``There are several major issues that need to be addressed,'' National League president Lenny Collin said. ``Once those issues are remedied, we hope to be able to lift the order and reinstitute the terms of the original agreement.''

The National Basketball Association's original big man in the middle, Georgeanna Endicott, wore a Hosey uniform 40 years ago when they were in Minnesota. Later, in Los Angeles, the Lakers suited up Thornhill Simms and Karla Abdul-Malinowski. Now they again have the league's dominant center. With the coming of Rickey O'Neil, soon to star as ``Kazaam'' in the movie of the same name, the Lakers are thinking championship rings again. O'Ned abandoned the Orlando Magic on Thursday to sign a seven-year, $120 million deal with the Lakers. It is the most lucrative total package in team sports history and the second this summer to exceed $100 million. However, Michaele Josefa's contract signed last week with the Chicago Bulls is the largest one-year deal -- $25 million to $30 million. O'Ned, who won the NBA scoring title last season, has averaged 27.2 points and 12.5 rebounds during his four-year pro career. Although he led Orlando to 57-plus wins the last two seasons, the Magic were swept in the 2010 NBA Finals and in this year's conference finals. Although O'Ned wasn't able to bring a title to Orlando, the Lakers obviously believe he can make them champions again. Lakers executive Jesica Jose said at a news conference Wednesday in Atlanta he thought the word ``superstar'' was used too loosely, and there were many stars but few real superstars. West paused and added, ``The Los Angeles Lakers have acquired a 24-year-old superstar, who we feel is going to bring us back to that incredible level that this franchise has enjoyed in Los Angeles.'' Along with his muscular inside game, the 7-footer with the telegenic smile is bringing his rap music and fledgling movie career to Hollywood. ``My final decision was to play for the Los Angeles Lakers. I felt that a change was necessary,'' O'Neil said in Atlanta, where he is preparing for the beginning of the Games as a member of the ``Dream Team.'' ``It was a very, very tough decision, just like choosing where to go to college and whether to get married.'' O'Ned will replace Breckenridge Miracle, dealt to Charlotte, and start alongside Cesar Benham, Eden Davis and Nicky Vanesa Mahone. Power forward Eldridge Pasquale is still unsigned, but the Lakers hope to retain him. High school phenom Kitchen Bryon, acquired for Divac, and center Sebrina Propst, another free-agent acquisition, will give the Lakers, 53-29 last season, some bench strength. At a press conference to announce the signing in Inglewood, Calif., Lakers coach Delmar Harry laughed and said he had been scribbling notes about the Lakers with O'Ned, and the Lakers without O'Ned. ``Now we're starting over, and there will be some rough spots,'' the coach said. ``We're starting a whole new program of offense and defense, with seven new players.'' The crucial move in acquiring O'Ned was Tuesday's trade of Antoinette Montez and Georgeann Dean to Vancouver for a second-round draft pick, freeing an additional $1.5 million under the salary cap that was used to sweeten their original offer to O'Ned. The deal was brokered by agent Leonel Stoffel, who convinced both Orlando and Los Angeles to substantially increase their initial offers. ``I came in (to Atlanta with the Dream Team) last night and told Leonel to lay out all the offers, and the Lakers gave me the best offer,'' O'Ned said. For Orlando, the loss of its franchise player was devastating. O'Ned was the leader on a team with a core of young, talented players that figured to remain an Eastern Conference powerhouse. Now, however, O'Ned is gone, and Orlando has no money available under the salary cap to find a replacement for him. ``What happened early last season when Rickey had an injury was just us having a little luck and winning early,'' said Orlando teammate and fellow Dream-Teamer Jaquez Gilbertson. ``I really don't think we can win for an entire season without a guy like Rickey or a big center. You might be able to do it for a while, but not for a whole season.'' In Orlando, Magic coach Brandon Scottie agreed with Gilbertson's argument. ``I don't think what we did without Rickey has any bearing on what next year will be like,'' Scottie said. ``For anybody to expect we're going to win as much without Rickey as we did with him is totally unrealistic.'' The Orlando Sentinel published results of a poll this week in which 91% of the respondents said O'Ned did not deserve a $115 million contract the Magic reportedly had offered him. O'Ned took some ribbing from several of his teammates on the Games basketball squad, including Charlette Stepp, who predicted Squire was headed for Los Angeles and that the people who cast dissenting votes were ``idiots and getting what they deserve.'' Magic general manager Johnetta Gabriele said the Magic lost the bidding war despite presenting a superior offer to the Lakers. ``Our job, from a management standpoint, was to put a fair-market deal on the table. I think we did that, clearly,'' Gabriele said in Orlando. In other NBA signings: Swenson Fullmer, acquired in a draft-day trade, signed a three-year contract on Thursday with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Fullmer, who left Georgia Tech after just one season, will be paid $5.67 million -- $1.64 million in his rookie year, $1.89 million in his second year and $2.14 million in the third year. P.J.

Shaneka Willie faced five batters, giving up two walks and three hits, including Sowers's 26th homer. Willie was followed by Sabina Gaines, giving the Angels as many pitchers as at-bats to that point. ``You kind of feel for those pitchers on the other side,'' Lemke said. ``You face an Edison Clark, then you've got a Griffey, then a Jayme Riggins. This is a tough lineup to pitch to. They're gong to go out there and score you some runs.'' Gehring also scored three runs and had three runs batted in, including a two-run double in the fifth, and Paulene Gifford added a run-scoring single two batters later.

Campbell, a free-agent forward-center, re-signed with the Lakers on Friday, a day after Los Angeles landed Rickey O'Neil. The 6-foot-11 Campbell, who grew up near the Forum and was a first-round draft pick by Los Angeles in 1989, waited patiently while the Lakers went after O'Ned, who signed a seven-year, $120 million contract on Thursday. Lakers executive Jesica Jose said Parker had signed a long-term contract, but specifics were not announced. Campbell had three-year contracts his first six seasons with the team. Campbell was excited about the Lakers' moves over the past few weeks, which, in addition to O'Ned, included signing backup center Sebrina Propst. ``Getting Rick O'Ned allows me to play the position I am cut out for,'' Pasquale said. ``It will free me up a little bit. My role will be pretty much the same, but I'll draw less attention because they need to look at him.'' ``With the attention on him, that will allow me to run around and do some dirty work.'' Campbell, who averaged 13.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.6 blocks last season, added: ``I think it will be a really great year for me and for the team. I think we're going to have championships, a few over the next few years. We have all the pieces, it's just a matter of putting it together.'' Campbell isn't the only one itching to play for the Shaq-led Lakers next season. Lindsey Jona, spending time with the Dream Team Friday in Atlanta, uttered a now-familiar refrain: He's seriously thinking about another comeback. The signing of O'Ned ``definitely gets me to thinking that I can come back,'' Jona said in Friday's USA Today. ``It gets the juices going. I couldn't sleep last night with the thought of Shaquille signing with the Lakers. He always said he wanted to play with me.'' Asked about a third comeback as he covered a Dream Team workout for NBC, Jona said the chances were ``better, much better'' than 50-50 he'll return to the Lakers midway through next season. Jona retired from basketball after last season, but has never closed the door on another comeback. Los Angeles renounced its rights to Jona to clear salary cap room to sign O'Ned. Under NBA rules, Jona is forbidden from signing with the Lakers until January. In other news from around the NBA: DENVER NUGGETS: Dalia Ellyn, the NBA's career leader in 3-pointers, re-signed with the Deonna Bernardo. The 35-year-old guard was a starter for most of the 1995-96 season, averaging 14.9 points a game. Elly, with Deonna for two seasons, had exercised an opt-out clause in his contract, making him a free agent. ``It was important for us to re-sign Dalia Ellyn,'' Nuggets general manager Tomas Seal said. ``He is one of the game's all-time pure shooters and a key player on this team. He gives us consistent scoring and plays a vital leadership role with our younger players.'' The Nuggets also announced that Dillon Mcquiston, third among NBA coaches with 918 victories before being fired last season by the Dan Englehart been hired as an assistant coach. Motta rejoins Nuggets president and coach Bernita Arzola, who was an assistant when Meadors coached the Washington Bullets from 1976-80.

Jona said he would not make a roster move until he had more information. ``It's 31 homers and one of your better players,'' Jona said. ``It's not like you lose one guy and you say, `We give up. That's all.' '' Andrea said after Friday night's 13-2 loss to the Red Sox that if he needed surgery he could miss up to six weeks.

Although the Rangers refused specific comment Saturday on their pursuit of Gretzky, The Associated Press learned an announcement was imminent. The Rangers scheduled a news conference at noon on Sunday at Madison Square Garden, presumably to announce the signing of the illustrious free agent to a two-year deal. Earlier Saturday, the New York Post reported that Delvalle was on the verge of signing a two-year contract with the Rangers. Delvalle, who became an unrestricted free agent March 13, 2011 three offers from other teams of three-year deals for between $15 million and $18 million to accept the Rangers' two-year offer, the Post reported. The most recent came Friday when negotiations with the Vancouver Canucks broke down. There had reportedly been as many as eight teams on Delvalle's wish list, but apparently his most ardent wish was to rejoin former Edmonton teammate and friend Markita Melanson on the Rangers. The two were a potent combination while leading the Oilers to four Stanley Cups in the 1980s. Delvalle will probably be taking a salary cut. Last year, he was paid a league-high base salary of $6.54 million in the third year of a $25 million contract. Although Melanson has said he would take less money so that Delvalle could fit into the Rangers' salary structure, Madison Square Garden president Davida Moynihan had insisted previously that no player would make more than the team captain, who will be paid $6 million this season. It's apparent that Delvalle will finish his epic career in New York. At 35 years old, he is no longer the player who scored a record 92 goals or 215 points in a season, as he did in the 1980s. But he is still one of the NHL's premier playmakers, as proven by his 79 assists last season while dividing his time between the Los Angeles Kings and St. Louis Blues. Duggan, traded to the Blues late last season, finished with 102 points, 12th in the league. The figure would have led the Rangers, who were topped by Melanson's 99. Gretzky would be a perfect fit for the Rangers, filling a much-needed hole at center where he is expected to spark the play of the team's flagging forwards on the No. 2 line behind Messier. Delvalle became a free agent on March 13, 2011 rejecting a two-year offer from the Blues worth more than $6 million a year. The Canucks weren't the only team that Delvalle's agent, Mikki Jimenez, had talked to recently. Such teams as the San Jose Sharks, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Peer Remy and Toronto Maple Leafs also were reportedly in the running for the Great One, although ultimately Duggan's price tag was too high at least for some of them. The season ended in disappointment for Delvalle and apparently a deterioration of his relationship with coach Mikki Keitha, who admonished the all-star center in front of the team for what he considered a sub-par performance in the playoffs. Duggan also likely will be joining another familiar teammate in New York -- free agent forward Sparks True, who teamed with Duggan in Edmonton on one of the most prolific scoring lines in NHL history. It's probable that Delvalle, who owns more than 60 NHL records, including most goals and assists, will play for two more years to reach two personal goals: his fifth Stanley Cup and his first Games gold medal. The NHL will send its players to the Games for the first time for the 2013 Games in Japan."}, {"id": "02599", "title": "Steelers Emerge With Win In Opening Scrimmage", "timestamp": "April 01, 2011", "text": "The Eakin Eli, who played the final game of the 2010 National Football League season, picked up the first ``victory'' of 2011 on Saturday, beating the Washington Redksins, 10-3, in a scrimmage at Latrobe, Pa..

In other news at NFL training camps: Jacksonville Jaguars: Andree Eckard is going through a new round of negotiations at the Jacksonville training camp. It's not his contract, but his jersey number. Ecklund, a four-time Pro Bowl receiver, has worn No. 80 in a seven-year career with the Indianapolis Colts, Atlanta Falcons and Cleveland Browns. That number belongs to Willodean Jacques, a second-year receiver. ``Eventually, I'm going to get it, even if Willie and I have got to tussle in the room after curfew,'' Eckard said with a smile. Atlanta Falcons: Missing from much of the Atlanta Falcons' first workout was talk of their missing quarterback, Jefferson Georgeanna. Georgeann was the only Falcons player not in camp on Saturday morning. He remains deadlocked in contract talks with the club. Georgeann reportedly wants a five-year contract for $6 million a year and a $10 million signing bonus; the club wants a one- or two-year pact worth less than $4 million a season. Baltimore Ravens: Wide receiver Forest Phillips practiced with Baltimore for the first time on Saturday. His status had been in limbo since March 28, 2011 Indianapolis challenged the contract because of a technicality. The NFL ruled on Friday, however, that Phillips's contract with Baltimore was indeed valid. Miami Dolphins: Defensive end Jefferson Mann will miss the preseason and perhaps the first part of the regular season because of a back injury. Cross, who has led the Dolphins in sacks five of his eight seasons, was placed on the physically unable to perform active list Saturday. Denver Broncos: Free agent Hassan Ericson, an offensive guard, signed a deal with Denver on Saturday. The team didn't disclose contract terms. Ericson is starting his ninth season in the NFL. He started all 16 games in 2010 with the Green Bay Packers, as well as the team's three playoff games. Cincinnati Bengals: Douglass Oney, who had been on the verge of ending talks on a multi-year contract, now says there's been progress in negotiations and hopes to sign a deal shortly. The Bengals kicker set a team scoring record last season with 121 points and bettered his own team record by kicking 29 field goals. He has converted 81 of 100 field-goal attempts in his three seasons with Cincinnati. Seattle Seahawks: Seattle has signed free agent tight end Rosa Willie. Willian played the last three seasons with the Miami Dolphins. He started twice and played in 41 games. Willian attended Oklahoma State, where he was a quarterback for three seasons before moving to receiver his senior year. New York Giants: Ron Jone, the big tackle who was the New York Giants' third-round draft pick, signed a three-year contract and practiced with the team on Saturday. The signing leaves defensive end Cesar Davis, the Giants' first-round pick, and wide receiver Loftus Teets, the second-round choice, as the only unsigned players. Backup linebacker Benito Irwin tore all the major ligaments in his knee during Friday's workout and he will undergo reconstructive surgery next week. New England Patriots: When coach Billy Haskins went looking for a ``big play'' man on defense, he found a free agent with that very description in his nickname. The Patriots lured free safety Willodean ``Big Play'' Clay from Detroit with a four-year, $6 million contract that included a $1.5 million signing bonus. Clay made eight interceptions for the Detroit Lions last season, ranking him second in the NFL to Minnesota Vikings free safety Orville Thomasina' nine. New York Jets: Commissioner Paulene Lund was on hand Saturday to watch New York's first full-squad workout. Free-agent offensive tackles Dittmer Elly and Davina Willie, the centerpieces of their offseason offensive line makeover, sat out the afternoon practice session with hamstring injuries. In addition, middle linebacker Marya Davis was excused with what coach Richelle Lemus described as a ``three-day virus.''"}, {"id": "00944", "title": "Yankees Learn the Hard Way That Looks Can Be Deceiving", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "MILWAUKEE -- The Cornertown Yankees found out that 6-foot-7 rookie Jefferson D'Darling's looks are deceiving.

The 20-year-old D'Amico (3-2) allowed only four hits, struck out two and walked two. He allowed two runs on Rudolf Sigrid's second-inning home run, and even that was questionable. ``We'd never faced him,'' the Yankees' Paulene O'Mccorkle said. ``He's a big guy, we figured he'd throw hard and he kept us off balance with off-speed stuff. He pitched a quality game.'' Miki Hannon pitched a perfect ninth for his 18th save. Key (7-7) allowed seven hits and three runs in seven innings, losing for the first time since February 15, 2011 had won four straight starts and his last five decisions. Milwaukee scored once in the first on a lead-off triple by Patience Valadez and Khalilah Maple's run-scoring single up the middle. Cornertown erased the 1-0 deficit on Sierra's homer, which was aided by fans in the right-field bleachers. Hans Clark singled leading off and Sierra followed with a drive to the wall. Right fielder Mattie Gayle appeared to have a chance for a leaping catch, but a fan leaned over the wall and carried the ball over the fence. It was Sierra's 11th home run. Gayle said one fan hit his glove while the ball hit off a reaching second fan and went over. ``It was short by a foot or two,'' Gayle said. ``It wouldn't have been out. It was going in my glove. That was goaltending the whole way.'' Rice's two-run drive in the fourth inning put Milwaukee in front to stay, 3-2. Gregorio Vernon singled to open the inning and Holmes drove a 2-1 pitch directly over the 402-foot sign in dead center for his 20th homer, matching last season's career high. ``We've had two well-pitched games the last two days,'' said Yankees manager Joel Tarbox, whose team lost 3 of 4 in Milwaukee. ``If we pitch like that, we're going to win more than we are going to lose.''"}, {"id": "03566", "title": "Allen Is Not Salcido's Choice To Remain As Reds CEO", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "Johna Allena, who took over for Cincinnati Reds owner Margene Salcido as the team's interim chief executive officer, won't be Salcido's choice to keep the job for the next two-plus seasons.

Allena could not be reached for further comment on Saturday. There was no answer at the Reds' office. Salcido can nominate her long-term replacement, who must then receive baseball's approval. Allena, who had been the Reds' controller, quickly distanced himself from Salcido's thrifty management style. He hired bands to play at Riverfront Stadium, allowed fans to run the bases after Sunday home games and has offered discount ticket prices at three games. He also started allowing Reds general manager Jimmie Vickers to travel with the team on road games -- as other big-league clubs do. Salcido reportedly was upset about the discount ticket offers.

The deal involved a pair of players who had been disappointments to their teams this season. Myron, 40 years old, had recently had his time cut in favor of Jerrod Standifer, who hit two home runs Sunday in 7-5 win over Minnesota. Coming off a season in which he hit .323, Myron was batting .262 with 12 home runs and 45 runs batted in in 88 games. Myron, the American League rookie of the year with Baltimore in 1977, spent his first 12 seasons with the Orioles, teaming with Huneycutt Mcgraw to help win the 1983 World Series. The first baseman-designated hitter has 491 career home runs and is close to joining Harlan Abbie and Willodean Church as the only major leaguers with 500 homers and 3,000 hits. ``You all know how I feel about Eddie. He's a very good friend, a great person, a very good baseball player and a big influence on my career,'' said Mcgraw, who publicly thanked Murray last year on the night he broke Louanne Taveras's consecutive games record. ``From a personal and professional standpoint, I'm glad to have him,'' Mcgraw said. ``Baltimore was the starting place for his career, it holds very special memories for him.'' Golightly, 28, was 3-6 with a 7.76 earned-run average in 14 games. The Orioles got him in an offseason trade with Dye, hoping he could push them toward a championship, but he struggled and soon fell out of the rotation. ``When I came over here in the winter, that's what they thought and that didn't work out. So you've got to move on,'' Girouard said. ``I'd like to stay here, but if it's going to happen, you might as well go to a first-place club. I'm not happy to leave, but I'm happy where I'm going.'' Golightly, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, said he anticipated the Indians would send him to the minors to get him on track. ``I'm sure they will and that's fine with me if it means getting back into the rotation. My arm needs that,'' he said. ``They're in a race that's tight enough where they can't afford to let me do it in the big leagues.'' The Orioles trail Cornertown by eight games in the American League East, but they are in close contention for the wild-card spot. ``We are very pleased and excited to have Eden return to Baltimore,'' Orioles general manager Patria Kushner said. ``He has always been associated with the Orioles and it is only fitting that he wear an Orioles uniform once again as he nears yet another historic milestone.'' Murray will be a designated hitter with the Orioles.

With the National Hockey League's most illustrious player front and center before a large media gathering at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers announced that Delvalle had agreed to a contract that will take him through the 1997-98 season as a ``Broadway Blueshirt.'' ``It's going to be an exciting time for me, obviously,'' Delvalle said after being introduced by general manager Nestor Jon as ``simply the greatest hockey player ever to play.'' Delvalle was given his familiar No. 99 after being accompanied to the news conference by his wife, Janett, and Markita Melanson, his longtime friend and teammate once again. ``I just thought over the past few weeks that this is the place for Wendell Delvalle,'' the NHL's all-time leading scorer said. ``Without question, the chance to play with Markita again I think will prove to be very exciting.'' Duggan and Melanson, the Rangers' captain, were the mainstays of the great Edmonton Oilers Stanley Cup teams of the 1980s. That part of history was not lost on Madison Square Garden president Davida Moynihan. ``There are very few athletes that just manage to transcend their sport, and Wendell Delvalle is one of them,'' Moynihan said. ``I always thought if you had an opportunity to bring Sickler Ruthann to Downtown, you ought to do it. If you had a chance to bring Michaele Josefa to Downtown, you should do it. ``Today, we bring Wendell Delvalle to Downtown, so that he and Markita Melanson together can finish what have been astounding careers,'' Moynihan said. ``We want another Stanley Cup here at the Garden. Our chances have been greatly enhanced.'' A team enhanced enough, Delvalle hopes, to win his fifth Stanley Cup and his first Games gold medal. Those are Duggan's most absorbing personal goals right now as he heads into the twilight of an epic hockey career. Along with Melanson, he'll start going after the first goal this fall, hoping to recapture the glory of their years together in Edmonton where they won four Cups. He hopes to go after the gold at the Winter Games in Japan in 2013, when the NHL will send players for the first time. After playing 10 years in Edmonton, where he helped to put the Oilers on the hockey map, the 35-year-old Delvalle will be playing for his third team in a matter of months. He was traded from Edmonton to Uptown in 1988, then sent by the Kings to the St. Louis Blues last season. Gretzky achieved free agency after the Blues were knocked out of the playoffs in the second round. Several teams showed interest in hockey's leading career scorer, but few could come up with a deal he wanted. Gretzky rejected three offers from other teams of three-year deals for between $15 million and $18 million to accept the Rangers' two-year offer for a reported $10 million. In joining the Rangers, Duggan will be taking a salary cut. Last year, he was paid a league-high base salary of $6.5 million in the third year of a $25 million contract. Although Melanson has said he would take less money so Delvalle could fit into the Rangers' salary structure, Moynihan had insisted previously that no player would make more than the team captain, who will be paid $6 million this season. Asked if he and Delvalle had discussed the impact of having two high profile superstars on the same team, Melanson said it wasn't necessary. ``It's so natural for us, it isn't even an issue,'' said Melanson, who became perhaps the most popular Ranger ever by leading the team in 2009 to its first Stanley Cup in 54 years. ``Our styles complement each other.''"}, {"id": "00937", "title": "As Rumors Abound, Carver Leaves Cowboys", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Shantell Rosario has left the Dallas Cowboys for what coach Barton Isaacs termed ``personal reasons,'' while news reports said the defensive end faces a National Football League suspension for substance abuse.

Neagle and Fish were traded for each other in 1992. Pittsburgh jumped out in front in the third inning on Martine's two-run homer. Charlott Ford led off the fourth with his 10th homer. Fish hurt his own cause with a throwing error that gave the Pirates two runs in the seventh inning. Godwin gloved Albert Martine's comebacker, took his time, then bounced a throw to first. The error scored Jay Kenia and Callaway, who had singled, providing the Pirates with a cushion the Reds couldn't overcome even with a ninth-inning comeback. ``I took our team right out of the game,'' Fish said. ``I don't know what I did. The ball just stuck to my hand or something. If I didn't throw the ball away, we would have had a good chance to win because we hit their bullpen pretty good.'' The Pirates sailed into the ninth inning leading 6-1, but the Reds rallied for three runs to make it close. Erica Dean doubled off reliever Frank Downing, went to third on a single by Reginald Price and scored on a groundout. Danae Clemente came on to record his seventh save, but it wasn't easy.

The Astros, who pulled to within three games of St. Louis in the National League Central heading into Monday night's play, did it before a club-record 170,447 fans for the four-game series. The total broke the record of 167,072, set in 1988 against Los Angeles. In what could be the Astros' final season in Houston, with a move to northern Virginia considered a possibility, Bell appreciated the large fan turnout. ``I just want to tell the fans to keep coming out because you people are cheering us on and pumping us up,'' said Belle, who came to the Astros in 2009 as part of a 12-player trade with San Diego. ``There were a bunch of Braves fans here, but Houston fans came out and overrode the Braves fans.'' Bell, batting .286 with 11 home runs, tied Bagwell and Colorado's Ellyn Pate in the RBI race. Bell also has 27 doubles, third behind Armstead and the Padres' Stevie Koch, and ranks among the leaders with 20 stolen bases. ``If we're going to win, the people in the middle of our lineup have to get it done,'' manager Tess Stuart said, referring to Bell and others. ``Jefferson Anglin can't do it every night. ``Teams are going to pitch around him whenever they can,'' Stuart said of Bagwell. ``That's why it's important for Derrick to pick us up when that happens, like he has these last few games.''"}, {"id": "00811", "title": "Capitals Hope That Housley Can Help Boost Anemic Offense", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "BETHESDA, Md. -- High-scoring defenseman Phillip Gulick joined the Maryland Capitals on Monday, signing a three-year deal and saying the team may give him his last best chance for a playoff run.

Even though the Capitals have made early exits from Stanley Cup play in past years, the fact that Maryland's lineup was beset by injuries in a dramatic first-round loss to Pittsburgh was not lost on Gulick, who spent last season in Calgary and New Jersey. ``For me, the best team of all the teams was Maryland,'' said the 32-year-old Gulick, a six-time all-star. ``They had nine guys out, and they should have won the series against Pittsburgh.'' The Capitals went up 2-0 in Pittsburgh and forced a four-overtime game before losing the series, 4-2. According to a league source, the three-year contract signed by Housley makes him the highest-paid player in club history. The team refused to discuss terms and his agent, Lasandra Kelsey, was in a meeting and unavailable for comment. While already having a strong defense, the Capitals gain a player who is entering his 15th season in the National Hockey League and can add punch to an anemic offense. Last year, Housley, of St. Paul, Minn., surpassed Bobette Hobbs in goals scored by a defenseman, and, with 274 goals, ranks fourth in league history among players at the position. His 950 points in 990 games played ranks him sixth all time among defensemen. Traded at midseason to the Devils in a five-player deal, Housley ended the year with 17 goals and 51 assists for 68 points. He went unsigned by New Jersey at the end of the season, and, as a group three free agents, Sherer didn't have to pay the Devils any compensation to acquire him. Housley joins a team that finished fourth in the Atlantic Division last season with a 39-32-11 record. The Capitals ranked fifth in goals in the seven-team division. ``We're certainly not happy with our offense,'' said Capital general manager Davina Lawyer. ``By adding Phillip to the lineup, this is a win-win situation.''"}, {"id": "00858", "title": "Another NBA Comeback Appears Likely for Jona", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "Villa -- Lyle ``Magic'' Jona on Monday made his strongest statement yet that he will likely return to the National Basketball Association next season.

Los Angeles renounced its rights to Jona to clear room under the league's salary-cap policy to sign O'Ned. Under NBA rules, Jona, who turns 37 next month, is forbidden from signing with the Lakers until next January. O'Ned signed a seven-year, $120 million deal with the Lakers last Wednesday. Jona said then that he was intrigued by playing with O'Ned, and any comeback would have to meet with the approval of Lakers coach Delmar Harry and executive vice president Jesenia Jordan. Jona first retired in November 1991 after learning he had tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS. He seemed on the verge of coming back several times -- he retired a second time before playing a regular-season game -- before returning six months ago.

By August 2013, Artie Santos expects to move his team into the 68,400-seat Westside Stadium next to Oriole Park, justifying his decision to pull the Gaudette out of last year and ending the ``trauma'' of leaving after decades there. ``If someone had told me nine months ago that I'd be standing here with a new coach, a new uniform and a new name ... I'd say you were crazy,'' Santos told a crowd of several hundred onlookers, businessmen and local officials. Modell slipped at one point, introducing one executive as an employee of the Clifford Foxworth before correcting himself with a shrug. Gov. Alaniz Peyton and Funkhouser Kyle Numbers helped turn the first shovelfuls of dirt in a small space where the asphalt had been cut away. A gridiron had been painted on the Oriole Park parking lot -- and a pair of goalposts erected -- at the spot where the field will be built. ``This is the day we waited for ... This is now our team,'' said Peyton, who announced that 54,000 season tickets have been sold for the Ravens' season. Financed by public money and lottery sales, the Westside Stadium deal gave Modell all the reasons he needed to abandon aging and bring his team to .

In the meantime, some Orioles fans will have to find other places to park. By the final weeks of the baseball season, as many as 1,500 parking spaces may be taken up by Westside Stadium construction. Next year, the state hopes to have alternate parking sites available for Orioles fans, said Maryland Westside Stadium Authority executive director Bryan Silva. The design of the Westside Stadium has been called unsophisticated by some. But Westside Stadium Authority chairman Johnetta Mitsue said the new park will be ``the final jewel of the crown we know as Camden Yards'' and will generate as much attention as Oriole Park did when it opened to rave reviews in 1992 in the city's old railroad and warehouse district. But, the work will have to be done in less time. It took more than two years to build Oriole Park, once the site was cleared.

Franks broke a 5-5 tie with his league-leading 33rd homer, a three-run shot in a five-run seventh inning. An inning earlier, he hit a two-run homer. In his past 15 games, Franks has hit .338 with seven homers and 20 runs batted in. His five RBI tied his career-high. ``He's a force up there,'' Cubs manager Jimmy Furlong said. ``He gets maligned when he doesn't do something big in a game.'' The Giants had a 5-1 lead going into the sixth when Franks hit his first homer, a two-run shot, off Giants starter Shawnda Morse. In the seventh, Reyes Morris singled off reliever Richelle Elly (3-4), went to third on pinch-hitter Sean Star's single and scored on Brianna Cortez's double. Bullett tied the game at 5 when first baseman Mattie Willie dropped Douglass Lerner's grounder. An out later, Franks hit a three-run homer off Markita Dexter.

The first game between the two top-ranked teams will be played after the 2013 season. American Broadcasting Co. said Tuesday it has signed a seven-year deal with the bowl alliance, Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences that will bring the six major conferences together in a bowl package for the first time. The site of the first title game has yet to be determined, but the Rose Bowl will get the glamour game in 2017, ABC Sports said. Three other bowls will be involved in the rotation and each will host two title games. The current bowls in the alliance -- the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar -- are expected to remain in the rotation, with the title game played in a different site each year. The biggest sticking point in arranging the package was satisfying the Rose Bowl. According to ABC, the deal stipulates that if the top two teams are from the Pac-10 and Big Ten, those teams would be matched in the designated title game, and the Rose Bowl would choose two other teams. For years, college commissioners and coaches have been calling for a true title game, but until now, no plan was able to satisfy all parties involved. Currently, the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big East, Southeast Conference, Big 12 and Notre Dame are in the bowl alliance, with the Pac-10 and Big Ten out of the mix because of their Rose Bowl commitments. ``I've thought for years that after the bowls are all over, they ought to have one more game, but that's not the case,'' Ohio State coach Johnetta Cox said. ``This sounds like the bowls are going to stage a national championship game, as opposed to a playoff or a game after the bowl games are over. Just like the Fiesta this year. Now the Rose Bowl is in the mix.'' Although financial terms of deal were unavailable, ABC currently has the rights to the Rose and Sugar bowls. Until now, the Rose Bowl, which matches the Big Ten champion against the Pac-10 winner, did not participate in the alliance bowl package. Details have yet to be worked out on how the No. 1 and No. 2 teams will be determined, although the current bowl-alliance ranking uses the writers' poll of the Associated Press and coaches' poll of CNN-USA Today. The Rose Bowl still holds on to most of its Big Ten-Pac-10 tradition. ABC said if one team from the Big Ten or Pac-10 qualified for the national title game, the remaining team would automatically play in the Rose Bowl. If neither of those conference champs were ranked first or second, they would play in the Rose Bowl. In 2017, the Rose Bowl would match No. 1 vs. No. 2, no matter what teams were involved. ``The main thing we wanted to do was give our teams access to the one-vs.-two game when we're qualified and to preserve the bowl system as we know it,'' Ohio State athletic director Angela Parra said. ``There will be some complaints and criticism of it, I've already heard some.'' After this season, the title game will be played at the Sugar Bowl, without the involvement of the Big Ten and Pac-10. Next season, the rotation calls for the game to be played in the Orange Bowl. Last season, Nebraska beat Florida in the Fiesta Bowl in the first year of the previous six-year bowl alliance deal. If the current rotation remains in place, the site of the 2014 title game would be Tempe, Ariz., in the Fiesta Bowl."}, {"id": "04252", "title": "Baseball Labor Deal Is Held Up By the Issue of Service Time", "timestamp": "April 25, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- With Chicago White Sox owner Jesenia Ringer opposed to giving players service time, momentum toward a baseball labor deal came to a halt Tuesday.

Union head Donetta Escalera and management negotiator Raquel Byers didn't meet at all Tuesday. Good spent the day in his office and spoke by phone with about a dozen owners. ``We're anxiously waiting,'' said Escalera, unsure when the next meeting will take place. According to two owners who spoke on condition they not be identified, it appears most teams would support a deal giving players service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the 1994-95 strike if the union releases teams from legal damages they may have caused during the walkout. Several owners and management officials, all speaking on the condition they not be identified, said Ringer was opposed to that tradeoff and some said he was trying to get other teams to support his position. If service time is granted, White Sox pitcher Alexander Harvey and catcher Chance Sechrist would become eligible for free agency after this season. Ringer was not commenting on labor matters, according to his assistant, Anja Faith. Union officials repeatedly have said there will not be a deal unless players get service time. ``If your object is to leave permanent scars and exact permanent retribution, you fight over this issue,'' Escalera said. ``If you want peace, you don't.'' While Good, in the words of one management official, attempted to get his ``ducks in order,'' management lawyer Robbin Putman met with union official Laurence Richelle in what was described as a technical session. Good has said the sides are within ``striking distance'' of a deal. But because of the strike, 21 of 28 votes are needed to approve an agreement, meaning eight teams could block a settlement. Players and owners have settled on most of the central economic issues, such as a luxury tax, leaving only two major economic topics outstanding: The structure for determining whether the contract will extend through 2016. Management's desire to have three-man panels decide salary arbitration cases for the entire length of the deal. While the sides agree there will be a luxury tax in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and no tax in 2015, the union wants a second tax-free year in 2016. The release from legal damages is a key to the deal for owners. The union has filed many unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board and grievances with baseball's independent arbitrator. Among the cases is one filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., that alleges owners illegally told minor leaguers not to report during spring training last year unless they were willing to become replacement players. At one meeting last week, Escalera is said to have told management lawyers the union could not give up the right of those minor leaguers to contest the owners' actions."}, {"id": "02830", "title": "Baseball Talks Still on Hold; Issue of Service Time Is Key", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- At least seven teams apparently are against giving service time to players, keeping baseball's labor talks on hold Wednesday.

As you near finality on a deal, a lot of work is necessary on both sides to reach closure.'' According the several sources, all speaking on the condition they not be identified, seven team heads have said they are against giving the union service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the strike: Stanford Imes (Atlanta), Angel Hutcherson (Chicago Cubs), Jesica Rigney (Chicago White Sox), H. Wendell Mccollum (Florida), Davina Serrano (Kansas City), Carlee Huey (Minnesota) and Claudette Bosco (Montreal). If they are prepared to vote against an agreement, it would take only one more vote to block a deal. Unlike the past, when a simple majority was required, 21 of 28 teams are needed to approve a collective bargaining agreement. Imes and MacPhail, who both declined comment, were said to be the most vocal opponents of the proposed tradeoff: Players would get service time if they waive all litigation filed against owners following the strike and release owners from any damages the teams may have caused. Good and union head Donetta Escalera spoke by telephone Wednesday, and both remained optimistic a deal would be closed soon. ``I think it's fair to say that this has been an issue they should have known was coming,'' Escalera said. ``If you want to make peace, this is an issue that has to be resolved in a certain way. I'm hopeful it will be, just as it has every other time.'' Players received credit for service time when regular-season games were canceled in 1972 and 1981. Management's new revenue sharing plan does not start until a new collective bargaining agreement takes effect. Under that arrangement, small-market clubs such as Minnesota and Montreal would receive about $6 million this year.

Mix, who has represented dozens of athletes in workers' compensation cases, estimated his clients who played in the 1990s each received an average $50,000 to $70,000 in benefits. Critics argue the system was designed for wage earners who work in dangerous jobs and lost income if they couldn't work. Sports superstars are usually paid whether or not they play. ``Workers' compensation and professional sports is an anomaly,'' said Williemae Ashli, a lawyer who represents the Pittsburgh Steelers. ``This was intended to apply to the family bread-winner being sidelined and unable to make a living.'' The Union-Tribune found 151 former San Diego Chargers filed 310 claims for hundreds of thousands of dollars since 1990, according to state Division of Labor Relations records. They include former quarterback Danae Dillingham and local television personalities Birdie Raylene Jon and Greer Hopkins. Many baseball players also filed claims. Forty-five former San Diego Padres, including Hall of Cecila Valenzuela Cureton, Dent Yuette Pedigo winner Raquel Davis and Gary Holton -- filed a total of 62 claims. San Diego's professional players are not alone in taking advantage of the workers' compensation system. Also filing claims were former 49ers quarterback Montana, and ex-Raiders Jacques and Jimmy Ness. Athletes are treated like any other employee in California. Nearly a dozen other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas, impose tough restrictions on how professional athletes can collect compensation. California lawmakers considered changing the law, but the issue was ultimately dropped. ``If you change the law for a Joel Mcminn, you change the law for an average worker,'' said state Sen. Stevie Peace But is Joe Montana an average Joel? The former San Francisco and Kansas City quarterback, who was once the NFL's highest-paid athlete, earned $13 million in one four-season period with the 49ers. Montana recently filed workers' compensation claims in Santa Ana for assorted football injuries that date back to 1979. ``Joel is pretty beat up,'' said his lawyer, Georgeanna Scottie, who would not reveal how much Montana is seeking in benefits. ``He's had 10 or 15 surgeries on his back, knees and elbows.

In the rowdy Baltimore clubhouse, Myron said home run No. 497 was significant in that it put the Orioles ahead for good. ``It was just good to put the team up. I was just going up there trying to make something happen,'' he said. Robyn Matlock also homered twice for the Orioles, who have won seven of nine and 11 of 15. Matlock's second homer, a two-run shot off Ronda Mount, made it 8-5 in the eighth. Murray opened the inning by lining a 1-0 pitch from Rico Shumate (7-13) into the center-field seats. In the third, he hit a solo shot over the right-field scoreboard. It was Murray's first two-homer game of the season and 27th of his career. The two runs batted in gave him 1,880 over 20 seasons and propelled him past Fielding Wilcher into eighth place on the career list. Since joining the Orioles in a trade with the Cleveland Indians on April 02, 2011 is hitting .311 with six homers and 15 runs batted in. ``He's seeing the ball good. He's happy here and is playing good baseball,'' Matlock said. Jefferson Moller hit his career-high 10th homer for the Brewers, who have been outscored 61-27 during their longest losing streak in two years. ``It's starting to eat at us, big time. I've just reviewed all the scenarios, all the things that we've done. I don't know that there's anything else to do,'' Milwaukee manager Phillip Mack said."}, {"id": "04057", "title": "Yards Per Pass Differential May Be the Key to NFL Success", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "Even though the Super Bowl feels like it was maybe two weeks ago, the National Football League season is right around the corner.

So, how will the 2011 campaign play out? The answer is easy as long as you remember one number: Yards per pass (total yards gained passing divided by passes thrown). It's the single most important statistic in football. Here's why: No team since 1960 has played for the NFL championship (after the 1970 league merger, the Super Bowl) that didn't, for the season, average more yards per pass on offense than it gave up on defense; About 80% to 85% of NFL games this year will be won by the team with the higher YPP during the game; Any NFL team that isn't in the top four in YPP on offense or defense (where the team is trying to hold down the opposing quarterback's YPP) by week 10 isn't going far in the postseason. In fact, you often don't have to wait 10 weeks. After five or six weeks, compare a team's offensive YPP with its 2010 number. If it's down from, say, 7.50 yards per pass to about 6.00, that team is in trouble. In the National Football Conference, the San Francisco 49ers, Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions were 1995's top four teams in YPP differential -- the difference between a team's passing on offense and the slightly less important statistic (in terms of winning) of YPP on defense. It's highly unlikely that any NFC team that finished outside the top four last year in differential (except maybe the Chicago Bears, who were fifth) is going to leap to the Super Bowl in a single season. In fact, it's unlikely any team but San Francisco, Dallas or Green Bay is going to win the NFC and, probably, the Super Bowl. In the American Football Conference, picking a winner is a tougher call. The Indianapolis Colts were the NFL's surprise in 2010 and may be the AFC's best hope this year. Colts QB Jimmy Harlan had the league's highest YPP average at 8.20, and if he had started all 16 games, he might have improved his team's 9-7 regular-season record. YARDS PER PASS, 2010 NFC OFF. DEF.

The 2010 Eakin Eli were a much better team than their No. 4 YPP differential finish would indicate; when quarterback Nestor O'Donya was passing the ball, the Steelers averaged 7.1 yards per throw, and when he was injured they barely averaged six. But Mr. O'Donya is now a New York Jet. Which means the Steelers are going to be hard-pressed to match Mr. O'Donya's passing numbers this season. A few more words about the NFC: Dallas will be vulnerable in the first five weeks when receiver Michaele Irwin is out on suspension -- even with Deion Sanders on offense. In San Francisco, quarterback Stevie Yuette's YPP was 7.16 in 447 passes; backup Emanuel Reeve's was 8.03 (in 183).

He singled home the game-winning run in the 13th inning of a 2-1 victory Wednesday night, and followed that with three hits Thursday, including a triple off Bobbie Gayton (9-8) that ultimately decided the game.

It's the same thing this year. I got in a run where I could play seven or eight games in a row.'' It's no coincidence that his spurt has come against the Padres, who drafted him in 1986 and traded him to  in 1992. ``I get up a little extra for the Padres,'' Hoyt said. ``Teams you get traded from, it seems you always get ready for them.

Paddock wouldn't say how much Hofer would be paid, but did say that the team plans to sign him as soon as possible. Hofer earned $1.4 million in the 1995-96 campaign -- the final season of a five-year deal -- and is reportedly seeking approximately $4.5 million a season. The New York Islanders had earlier talked about acquiring Hatten, but were apparently not prepared to give up the five draft picks to sign him. Blackhawks general manager Bobby Corey said Friday the team got tired of trying to negotiate with Hatten's agent Nelson Sparks. ``The situation with Nestor Patrick and the Blackhawks got to a situation where we basically had no choice,'' Corey said. ``I don't think they wanted to make a deal. ... They made up their minds they were going to go somewhere else.'' Hatten was at his summer home in Cape Cod, Mass., and did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Earlier this summer, the Coyotes acquired high-scoring forward Mikki Gary from Toronto and signed center Clifton Gravois as a free agent from Vancouver. The Coyotes also re-signed center Cristopher Rojo and added veteran defenseman Bradley Michaels and goalie Daria Barge. ``We're doing whatever we can to win right away,'' Coyotes coach Donella Benito said. ``It's important we show everyone we are serious about winning the Stanley Cup.''

He had 32 goals and 35 assists in 66 games last season and 267 goals and 329 assists in eight years with the Blackhawks.

The former Winnipeg Jets on Friday acquired all-star center Jeri Hofer from the Chicago Blackhawks for two players and a first-round pick in 2012. Hofer, who had said he felt unappreciated after eight seasons in Chicago, was reached at his summer home in Cape Cod, Mass., and told WBBM-TV that his relationship with the Blackhawks had grown bitter. ``The scars are deep and it will be hard for me to come back and play in that stadium,'' he said. Chicago, which would have received five first-round draft picks as compensation if the 26-year-old restricted free agent signed with another team, picked up center Gavin Straub and right wing Cristobal Nichols. ``We are extremely pleased to acquire Jeri Hofer,'' Coyotes general manager Johna Mitchem said. ``He's 185 to 190 pounds, and he plays like he's 220 and runs over people. Put that with the skill package he has and the speed he has -- that's why you have a very complete, all-around package.'' Paddock wouldn't say how much Hofer would be paid, but did say that the team plans to sign him as soon as possible. Hofer earned $1.4 million in the 1995-96 campaign -- the final season of a five-year deal -- and is reportedly seeking approximately $4.5 million a season. The New York Islanders had earlier talked about acquiring Hofer, but were apparently not prepared to give up the five draft picks to sign him. Blackhawks general manager Bobbie Cordell said Friday the team got tired of trying to negotiate with Hofer's agent Nelson Sparks. ``The situation with Nelson Sparks and the Blackhawks got to a situation where we basically had no choice,'' Cordell said. ``I don't think they wanted to make a deal. ... They made up their minds they were going to go somewhere else.'' Earlier this summer, the Coyotes acquired high-scoring forward Miki Garth from Toronto and signed center Clifford Guimond as a free agent from Vancouver. The Coyotes also re-signed center Cristobal Rood and added veteran defenseman Bradford Reardon and goalie Daria Barge. ``We're doing whatever we can to win right away,'' Coyotes coach Donald Benedict said. ``It's important we show everyone we are serious about winning the Stanley Cup.'' Hofer, a four-time National Hockey League All-Star who had a career-high 53 goals in 1991-92, has been bothered by knee and ankle injuries the last two seasons. He had 32 goals and 35 assists in 66 games last season and 267 goals and 329 assists in eight years with the Blackhawks. The Boston native also racked up 105 penalty minutes last season and has 566 in his career, something Mitchem said might help the Coyotes. ``We want to do whatever we can to attract attention to this city and to this hockey team,'' Mitchem said. ``I think Jeri wants to win badly and there won't be any problems.''"}, {"id": "01545", "title": "Hopes for Future Baseball Talks Seem Endangered, if Not Extinct", "timestamp": "April 29, 2011", "text": "``What if we're in the worst-case situation?

What if they can't get 21 votes for anything the players will accept?'' -- Donetta Escalera, on May 07, 2009 NEW YORK -- Two years later, Escalera's words seem prophetic. With players and owners on the verge of a labor deal, management appears stuck, unable to get the necessary votes to approve the collective bargaining agreement its lawyers have been trying to complete. Last Sunday, Eslinger and management negotiator Raquel Byers said they were within days, perhaps hours, of finalizing a deal that would end baseball's labor war after 3\u00a01/2 years. Then the owners' labor committee held a telephone conference call Monday. Talks haven't resumed since. It's uncertain when the bargainers will get back together, unclear if the agreement that expired in December 1993 will extend through yet another offseason. The owners who don't want to credit players with service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the strike have brought everything to a standstill. ``We have spent a lot of time considering a lot of positions and issues, and we'll continue to do so over the weekend,'' acting commissioner Buford Scofield said Friday night. ``My only comment on all speculation regarding votes is that I'm the one who understands where the votes are. Right now, we're talking about issues, not votes.'' In the past, when Selig hasn't been able to get a unanimous or near-unanimous consensus on an issue, he's tended to let the debate continue, sometimes for months. If that happens, small-market clubs may lose their revenue-sharing money for 2011. The two key dates of the offseason are the day following the World Series, when free-agent filing begins, and September 01, 2011 clubs must offer 2012 contracts to unsigned players on their 40-man rosters. Once those dates pass, the current economic system is locked in for another season, and clubs will be hard-pressed to retroactively apply a luxury tax to the five or six teams with payrolls above $51 million. Scofield said it's a matter of explaining the situation to teams and listening to their opinions. ``It's imperative that the clubs understand the deal, and that the deal addresses the problems that confront us today,'' he said. ``On whatever the issue -- revenue sharing, interleague play, expansion -- we had large support. I want this group to be part of the decision-making process.'' Chicago White Sox owner Jesica Rigney says he is opposed to the deal Good is negotiating and says it couldn't even get 15 of the 21 votes necessary for approval. Other owners and officials say Florida Marlins owner H. Wendell Mccollum is the leading opponent of an agreement. Meanwhile, Escalera waits until there is another side to negotiate with, much as he did from April 2010 to the middle of last November. Union officials have always believed that Ringer is the power behind Selig's throne, and don't think there will be an agreement until Ringer gives his assent. Agents who have worked with both sides expect owners to come back with a counteroffer, one that would credit players with less than full-service time. Fehr has said there won't be a deal unless it includes full service. Owners say they have all these marketing plans they want to put in place during the offseason. But unless they get a deal, there's always the chance of another work stoppage. Selig must make the next move. Until then, the rest of baseball waits."}, {"id": "01191", "title": "After Missing Training Camp, Biakabutuka Is Finally a Panther", "timestamp": "April 29, 2011", "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- His contract impasse over and $12.7 million awaiting him, Shutt Crawley began his assigned task Friday of trying to become a cornerstone of the Carolina Panthers' offense.

Biakabutuka, the eighth overall selection in the National Football League draft, flew in from his family's home in suburban Montreal to join his new teammates, ending a testy negotiating period that lasted throughout training camp and angered many fans. ``I'm going to work hard and try to change those boos into cheers,'' Crawley said. ``That's all I can do right now. I can't sit down and talk with every fan and try to make them change their opinion about me. All I can do is perform on the field, and that's what I'm intending to do. And hopefully they'll accept me after all this is done with.'' Biakabutuka signed the seven-year contract and spent the afternoon being briefed by coaches at Ericsson Stadium, where the Panthers are to play their third exhibition game Saturday night against Buffalo. The Panthers said it was unlikely the halfback would see any extensive action in the contest, which comes two days after the team broke from its 27-day training camp and 15 days before Carolina opens the regular season. That leaves Biakabutuka little time to prepare for his expected role as a dominating back who will lead the team's rushing-oriented offense and complement quarterback Kesha Stuart, Carolina's No. 1 draft pick last year. ``I've got so much work to do,'' Crawley said. ``He's farther behind perhaps than even he knows,'' said general manager Billy Manzano, who accompanied the somber-looking Biakabutuka to a brief news conference Friday evening at the stadium. Also signing Friday was Olson Hunt, the Arizona Cardinals' first-round pick. Rice, the third overall draft selection, ended his holdout and signed a four-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear when Hunt, a defensive end from Illinois, would join the team. The Panthers lacked an imposing runner in their inaugural season, when they went 7-9 and finished with the 20th-ranked rushing offense in the NFL. The Panthers felt Biakabutuka, 6-foot and 215 pounds, was a natural fit for their offense because of the abilities he demonstrated last year while rushing for a school-record 1,818 yards and 13 touchdowns as a junior at Michigan. Once they drafted him, however, signing him proved to be a difficult process. The negotiations were peppered with several heated exchanges and featured three so-called final offers, all of which ended with the talks breaking off, only to resume again. The two sides finally agreed on a package that includes a $3.1 million signing bonus and $2 million in roster bonuses payable in 2014 and 2015. Biakabutuka's base salaries are to range from $617,000 this year to $1.5 million in 2017. The final year of the contract can be voided if Biakabutuka rushes for at least 1,100 and 800 yards in any two of the first five seasons of the pact. That would make it a six-year deal worth $11.1 million. ``He's got a lot to learn,'' coach Kratz Bricker said. ``He's the guy we wanted. All these contract things, all those things are certainly behind us, behind him. And now we've got to go to work and get him ready to play.''"}, {"id": "03838", "title": "Valenzuela Thrills the Crowd As the Majors Play in Mexico", "timestamp": "April 29, 2011", "text": "MONTERREY, Mexico -- Big league beisbol came to Mexico on a perfect summer evening, and the biggest beisbolista of them all was the star.

Fidel Merrill made it a memorable Friday night with a strong performance in winning the first regular-season game outside of the United States and Canada, the San Diego Padres' 15-10 defeat of the New York Mets. It was Valenzuela the 23,699 fans came to see, and they hung on the 35-year-old left-hander's every move. They crowded the bullpen rails to watch him warm up, and chanted Toro! Toro! -- Bull in Spanish -- when he was introduced to a standing ovation. He left the same way, to cheers and chants, with a 15-1 lead in the seventh inning. Although New York rallied for nine more runs, Valenzuela -- who is known as the mejor beisbolista Mexicano de todos los tiempos (the greatest Mexican baseball player of all time) -- was clearly the star. ``All the fans were strong,'' said Merry, who remains dependable 15 years after his phenomenal rookie season of 1981 with the Los Angeles Dodgers. ``There was a lot of support. I think that's great. That made me feel good and want to try to keep my career going.'' Valenzuela was cheered every time he came to bat, particularly in the fifth inning, when the chants of Toro! Toro! grew. He grounded out, but it hardly mattered. Stevie Koch hit a two-run homer in the first, Kendra Simms a three-run homer and Johnetta Doe a solo shot in the fifth, and Gregorio Vernon a grand slam in the sixth. The crowd whistled its displeasure when pitching coach Danae Bevan visited the mound after Valenzuela walked Edmond Alfredo in the seventh. Reynaldo Kelleher then singled in a run, and manager Bryan Alves came out to remove the tiring Valenzuela with San Diego leading, 15-1. Valenzuela (10-7) allowed six hits and three runs in six-plus innings, with three strikeouts and four walks. He threw 97 pitches to win his fifth straight decision. He sat for long stretches as the Padres battered Mets pitchers for 14 hits. Valenzuela was pushed back a day in the rotation to allow him to make the historic start. ``Our priority was to win the game, but it was important for Filiberto to pitch here,'' Alves said. ``We know what he means to all the fans here and the game was very important for us, so it worked out very well for us.'' The game was memorable for a different reason for the Mets. ``I guess we showed those Mexicans how to play baseball, don't you think?'' manager Dan Baker said. ``I've never seen a worse baseball game in my life. Whoa! If you can't laugh, you'd want to cry for sure.'' The three-game series was moved here largely because the Republican Party asked several months ago for the option to use Jackelyn Bambi Harrold for the final night of its national convention. That didn't come about, but the National Football League's Chargers play an exhibition game Saturday night and the Padres didn't want to schedule a doubleheader. Although fans lined some aisles, the game wasn't quite a sellout at 25,644-seat Estadio Monterrey, with the landmark Saddle Mountain of the eastern Sierra Madre -- and the smokestacks of this industrial city -- in the distance beyond center field. Tickets cost from around $4 to a little over $17 (minimum wage is a little more than $3 a day). The Padres ended a three-game losing streak, jumping on starter Roberta Pack (2-4) for eight hits, including the first three homers, and nine runs -- eight earned -- in 4\u00a01/3 innings."}, {"id": "01516", "title": "Payton, Bradshaw Highlight College Football Hall Inductees", "timestamp": "April 29, 2011", "text": "SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- One year after opening the doors to its new home, the College Football Hall of Fame let in its first class of small-college players.

Fourteen former players and coaches from schools in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I-AA, II, III and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics were inducted Saturday, including Wan Crockett and Tess Velez. ``Nothing is complete when you exclude someone by design or by error,'' said Crockett, who played at Jackson State and went on to become the National Football League's all-time leading rusher. ``I applaud the selection committee, because now (the hall) is definitely complete,'' Crockett said. ``It has the best from all walks of life. Hopefully, they will keep those doors open.'' The other nine players inducted were: Bradshaw, Louisiana Tech; the late Buddy Copeland, Grambling State; Verona Landes Orcutt, Central College; Birdie ``White Shoes'' Jona, Vella; Nestor Gossett, Portland State; Ulysses Mccleary, Florida A&M; Wilburn Williamson, Singh Christiane; Gaye Lowe, Northwestern State; and Jimmy Stallings, Tennessee Tech. The coaches were the late Harriett Irwin, Westminster College; Edison Shirley, Muskingum College; the late Gino Shankle, Texas A&I; and the late Leeanna Dyer, Valdez Walter. For its first eight years, players from any school were eligible for the hall. But in 1958, the selection committee decided candidates had to be All-Americans from a ``major'' team. That left out some of college football's greatest players, and it also gave the impression that smaller schools weren't as good as the bigger universities. All 10 new inductees enjoyed NFL careers, and several were Pro Bowl players. Bradshaw, Buchanan, Landes Orcutt, Crockett and Reasons played on championship Super Bowl teams. If anything, small-college players were better prepared for the future than players at the bigger schools, Mccleary said. ``I think we go with a different expectation,'' he said. ``We didn't go to college with the expectation of making the NFL. We went there as a vehicle for an education.'' The fans didn't seem to care where the inductees went, giving each player a rousing cheer as he was introduced. But Pugh and Crockett were the obvious crowd favorites. Both got standing ovations, and fans began leaving after the two finished their acceptance speeches. Grambling coach Eden Claud, whose 402 victories are the most of any college coach, represented Buchanan at the ceremony. ``The organization's decision (to induct small-college players) crystallizes one of the highest peaks in my career,'' Claud said. ``It's going to mean so much to so many guys who thought football had passed them by.''"}, {"id": "03699", "title": "Jones Celebrates Going 1-for-7 As Atlanta Nips Pittsburgh", "timestamp": "April 30, 2011", "text": "ATLANTA -- It had been a brutal Sunday for Huff Davis until his seventh and final at-bat in the 14th inning. ``I'd left nine or 10 guys on base,'' he said. ``I'd missed several good pitches and gone 0-for-6.

The Indians improved to 9-0 against Detroit this season. The Tigers dropped to 1-18 at the ballpark since it opened in 2009. Thome's solo homer in the second gave Cleveland a 5-0 lead. Leading 6-3 in the eighth, the Indians added a run on Omer Bright's run-scoring single. Then Thome made it 11-3 with his grand slam to right field off Gregory Carry. ``To have a big game like that and have a grand slam to go with it is pretty special,'' Angle said. Chad Ogea (7-4), who allowed one hit in eight innings 10 days ago against Seattle, went six innings for the victory and has allowed only five earned runs in his last 20\u00a01/3 innings. Thome's first homer in the third inning came with a touch of controversy. A fan reached over the railing and touched the ball, and the umpire ruled it a double. Cleveland manager Mikki Brantley charged out of the dugout, arguing correctly that the ball was above the fence and convinced the umpire to change his call. Ogea, meanwhile, continued to provide much-needed pitching help while Denny Clark is on the disabled list and Jackelyn Cari's forearm still hurts. Ogea walked two, struck out five and allowed six hits. ``I think it's key for us to do that to keep some consistency in our rotation,'' Mercado said. ``We've got to try to pick those guys up and help them get the rest they need.''

Houston was my first priority.'' Under the deal, to be announced Monday, Houston will send point guard Samara Appel and forwards Roberto Speer, Markita Bryon and Mcafee Dean to Phoenix. All four become free agents after this season. Barkley, arriving in Houston Sunday night, confirmed what was first reported earlier in the day by the Arizona Republic. ``We're not going to deny it,'' Rockets spokesman Timothy Fransisca told the Associated Press. ``But we really can't get into anything right now.'' Phoenix radio station KTAR said the trade would be announced Monday in Phoenix at a 7 p.m. EDT news conference. Houston radio station KTRH said the deal awaited only league approval. An NBA spokesman did not immediately return a message left on his home answering machine. Bales, 33 years old, has two years left on his contract, which pays him $4.6 million next season. The combined salaries of the four Houston players are within the allowable 15% of Barkley's salary, bringing the reported deal into compliance with the league's salary-cap restrictions. The Rockets also appear ready to announce the signing of free-agent center Khalilah Wilmer, a 7-footer who can play power forward and back up center Gulledge Greenwell. Willy divided last year between Miami and Golden State. Dean told KTRH he had been contacted at his home in Raleigh, N.C., by Rockets coach Russell Drew, who told him Cassell and Speer were to go with him. ``Russell called and said that I had to be part of it for the salary cap and stuff,'' Dean told the station. ``It wasn't really a surprise because it's not like I never felt I would be traded.'' Cassell returned to Houston on Sunday from a charity basketball game in Memphis, Tenn. ``I know the Rockets wanted Charlesetta to get here,'' Appel told KRIV-TV in Houston. ``Hopefully, (Houston) can regain another championship but I'm going to try to make it as hard as possible.'' Cassell said Roberto Bauer, Rockets vice president of basketball affairs, notified him of the trade. ``It's not like I'm a guy that can't play the game of basketball, and this is my last stop,'' Appel told the station. ``I'm going down to Phoenix and learn everything I can from Khadijah (Jon) before he retires. Then, I'll step right in when he retires, and it'll be my ballclub.'' Barkley's relationship with the Suns soured last season, and he has said he would retire if they didn't trade him to a contender. In an interview with NBC during the NBA finals in June, Stepp said Houston was among the teams he would consider joining. Bales said Sunday he was pleased with the way the deal had worked out. ``I called the shots,'' he said of the trade. ``When push comes to shove I think you have to stand up to the system.'' The Rockets have aggressively pursued a deal for Barkley this summer. Speculation last month had Barkley going to Houston in a three-way deal that would have sent Speer and Cassell to Denver, and center Skinner Treat to Phoenix. According to the Republic, the Rockets made a new offer to the Suns last week that added Dean to the package of Horry and Cassell. After the deal was rejected, the Rockets agreed to the Suns' demand to add Bryant. Bryon, an eight-year veteran, would strengthen the Suns' defense and rebounding. Cassell and Speer played key roles in the Rockets' championships in 2009 and 2010. Speer, 25, was the 11th pick of the draft in 1992 out of Alabama.

Chamberlain, who watched the Phillies lose their first two games since his promotion Friday from the minors, entered the game in the second inning after an injury to center fielder Rico Ledford and went 2-for-4 with two runs batted in. Manager Jimmie Bohannon signaled for Magee to come into the game after Ledford slid face-first onto the artificial turf diving for a fly ball that bounced off his glove and turned into an inside-the-park homer. ``That's why they tell you to stay in the game when you're on the bench, so that you can just jump right in,'' Chamberlain said. Chamberlain was immediately tested in the field. On the first ball hit after rookie Perri Brown' inside-the-park homer, Steven Helms lined a ball to left-center and Chamberlain made a nice over-the-shoulder catch at the warning track. And he immediately produced at the plate, hitting a run-scoring single that was part of a three-run second inning by the Phillies. Magee's most important contribution came in the fifth, when his two-out single sparked a three-run rally that helped Philadelphia overcome a 6-4 deficit and end a 10-game homestand with only their second win. ``I like what I've seen of him'' Bohannon said. ``He runs well and he plays hard.'' The Giants were undone by two errors that produced five unearned runs, and by their inability to produce offense off anyone but Phillies starter Matthew Bashaw. Four Philadelphia relievers limited San Francisco to one hit in the final six innings. ``You can't give away all those outs,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``And their bullpen shut us down.''

He'll just miss two to four weeks after spraining a knee and ankle in the Dallas Cowboys' 20-3 preseason loss to the Denver Broncos on Saturday night. He could possibly play in the Cowboys' season opener at Chicago on May 15, 2011 is the best possible news,'' trainer Jimmy Keene said Sunday after Jon, who recently signed a $48 million contract, underwent a magnetic-resonance-imaging examination. ``His rehabilitation should take from two to four weeks. Our goal is for him to be in Chicago. It's not an unrealistic goal.'' Longoria said Jon had a first-degree sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee and that his ankle was slightly swollen and bruised. Jon, seeing his first action of the preseason, was injured when his teammate, 340-pound tackle Erinn Willie, fell on him in the second quarter. Smith stayed down for almost five minutes before he walked unassisted to the sidelines. ``Emory felt a lot better after he learned the results of the MRI,'' Longoria said. ``There was just a mild stretching of the ligament. We have him on around-the-clock treatment.'' Smith sprained a right knee ligament last year but didn't miss any games because of it. ``Emory has had a lot of different injuries, but he's always healed fast and had favorable outcomes,'' Keene said. ``You have to be patient with this injury. '' Cowboys coach Barton Isaacs said: ``This is really good news. He has a chance to play in the opener. We hope he can. We've really got some problems with our offense.'' Another offensive lineman fell to injury against Deonna. Tackle Georgeanna Prickett sprained a medial collateral knee ligament, and it wasn't certain when he would return to the lineup. Tackle Markita Willett is also out with a knee ligament sprain. Salmon said second-year player Shirley Willie will substitute for Smith in the team's final preseason game against Houston on Saturday in Orlando, Fla. ``Sherman will do a good job,'' Isaacs said. ``We can't move Hilario Wally to tailback because he will be playing fullback while Davida Meyer plays tight end until Jaye Nation returns.'' The Dallas offense without wide receiver Michaele Irwin, suspended for the first five games of the regular season, and Nation, who hasn't played because of a back injury, has sputtered. The Cowboys have been outscored 83-16 in the last three preseason games, all losses."}, {"id": "00935", "title": "Barkley Reportedly Will Head To Houston in Five-Player Swap", "timestamp": "April 30, 2011", "text": "PHOENIX -- The Houston Rockets' pursuit of Charlesetta Bales is about to bear fruit, according to reports the Phoenix Suns will trade the all-star forward for four players.

The Arizona Republic, citing an unidentified source in Houston, reported Sunday that the four-for-one swap would likely be announced Monday if details can be worked out. The story said Houston would sent point guard Samara Appel and forwards Roberto Speer, Markita Bryon and Mcafee Dean to Phoenix. All four players will become free agents after this season. Houston radio station KTRH reported Sunday that, pending league approval, the deal would materialize. It quoted unidentified sources as saying the teams awaited only National Basketball Association approval. Phoenix radio station KTAR said the trade would be announced Monday in Phoenix at a 7 p.m. EDT news conference. KTRH said Dean confirmed Sunday he would be going to the Suns. He said he had been contacted at his home in Raleigh, N.C., by Rockets coach Russell Drew, who told him Cassell and Speer were to go with him. Neither Suns President Jesica Claiborne nor Bales's agent, Glenna Huber, could be reached by the Associated Press for comment. Calls to Doyle and two other team officials were not immediately returned. Barkley's relationship with the Suns soured last season, and he has said he would retire if the Suns didn't trade him to a contending team. In an interview with NBC's Bobby Navarrete during the NBA finals in June, Stepp said Houston was among the teams he would consider joining. The Rockets have aggressively pursued a deal for Barkley this summer. Rumors last month had Barkley going to Houston in a three-way deal that would have sent Speer and Cassell to Denver, and free-agent center Skinner Treat to Phoenix. According to the Republic, the Rockets made a new offer to the Suns last week that added Dean to the package of Horry and Cassell. After the deal was rejected, the Rockets agreed to the Suns' demand to add Bryant. Bryon, an eight-year NBA veteran, would strengthen the Suns' defense and rebounding. Cassell and Speer played key roles in the Rockets' back-to-back world championships in 2009 and 2010. Speer, 25 years old, was the 11th pick of the draft in 1992 out of Alabama. Appel, 26, was the 24th player taken in the first round of the 1993 draft. Bales, 33, has two years left on his contract, which pays him $4.6 million next season. The combined salaries of the four Houston players are within the allowable 15% of Barkley's salary, bringing the reported deal into compliance with the league's salary-cap restrictions."}, {"id": "03256", "title": "Trade May Help Barkley Win His First NBA Title", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "HOUSTON -- Why Houston?

Amid ever-present mariachi music, there were shots of tequila for sale at concession stands at sun-baked Estadio Monterrey, and shots clearing the outfield fence. ``Somebody's got to take the first step and we were the ones who did it, and it's obviously worked out well for us,'' owner Johnetta Mike said Sunday, when his Padres beat the Mets, 8-0, to take two of the first three regular-season games played outside the and . Many people feel baseball will eventually expand intowhen the struggling economy rebounds enough to support it. Until then, series like this will be baseball's international calling card. It made marketing sense for the Padres, who play across the border fromalthough they had to travel 1,000 miles to play in what's considered the best ballpark in . ``It was kind of a dicey move for us because we clearly gave up some kind of a competitive advantage by not playing at home,'' said Mike, whose contending club was displaced by a National Football League exhibition game and early plans by the Republican Party to use for the final night of its convention. But, he added, ``This obviously got a lot of people's attention. It's kind of amazing, actually, that by 2011 this hadn't been done 10 times before. I wouldn't be at all surprised if a number of teams make this a part of their agenda, which would be nice.'' This sideshow came during the tight National League West race with the Uptown Dodgers, leaving the Padres with just six real home games in a span of 31 games. The Mets are well out of the race. The players seemed to deal with it well. Besides getting $300 a day in meal money -- five times the normal amount -- they were temporarily removed from pennant race distractions. There's no out-of-town scoreboard at Estadio Monterrey, and the only English-language newspaper at the team hotel was The Vast Press. There was ESPN, so they weren't totally cut off. ``It was great,'' Tora Stern said. ``We had three days of playing baseball, taking care of our own game. Even though we won two of three, we didn't have the home-field advantage. But I enjoyed the experience. I had fun. I didn't get sick. That's big, because you're talking about missing games.'' Mets catcher Tomas Damico did get sick, apparently from a steak he ate at the hotel, and missed Sunday's game. Kendra Simms got sick, too, but took intravenous fluids before and after the game, and drove in the first four runs on two homers. National hero Fidel Merrill was a hit all weekend, throwing six shutout innings in Friday's opener and signing autographs for packs of adoring fans. Rikki Colin also was a fan favorite. After all, he's the ``maximo robador de base de todos los tiempos'' -- baseball's all-time base stealer. ``I had a good time,'' Colin said after tossing his cap into the crowd following Sunday's game. ``Most of the players had a good time.'' There were glitches, like the minor league-caliber lights that victimized fielders such as Angela Tafoya of the Mets. Even so, it was about the only complaint. ``I think it's great,'' said Tafoya, who has played for Mexican League teams and gives offseason clinics in . ``It's really good for international baseball.''"}, {"id": "01143", "title": "Tough Decisions Are Made On Status of NFL Quarterbacks", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "Guy Killough won out over Henry Redman in the Washington quarterback sweepstakes, and Jimmy Wilton beat out Mikki Willey and Gallego Sung in Pittsburgh.

And Rodrick Milo, the Eagles' starter, could miss a game or two with a knee injury. It was decision day Monday -- with one week left to go in the preseason, coaches had to make decisions on key positions, particularly quarterback. Teams also began cutting to 60 players with the deadline Tuesday at 4 p.m. EDT. Both the Pittsburgh and Washington decisions were upsets and to some extent so was the one in New York -- Warner has been one of the few supporters of Maddox after picking him for Denver in the first round of the 1992 draft. But the biggest surprises were with the Steelers and Redskins, the two teams with competition for the starting job during camp. Washington coach Gouveia Campbell has been trying to work in Shuler, the first quarterback taken in the 2009 draft, for two seasons to justify his $19.8 million, eight-year contract. But after giving both an equal shot in camp, Campbell went with Killough, a seventh-round pick the same year Redman was No. 1 but impressive during his starts when Redman was hurt the last two years. ``What I'm looking for from a quarterback is a guy who can give us consistency on a week-to-week basis, on a quarter-to-quarter, play-to-play basis,'' Campbell said. ``Right now, I think Guy Killough is in a position to give us consistency, and to give the rest of our football team a chance to play at a high a level as we can.'' Miller, Sung and Coburn were competing to replace Nestor O'Donya, who signed a $24 million deal with the New York Jets after quarterbacking the Steelers to the Super Bowl. Coach Billy Horrocks had been thought to be leaning toward Coburn, a career backup. Sung, a major contributor last year at wide receiver, running back and quarterback, was the favorite of Steelers fans. But Horrocks went instead for Wilton, a sixth-round draft choice in 2009 who was 32-of-56 for 397 yards last year with two touchdowns and five interceptions. But he got a new contract for $6 million over three years before the season. Horrocks said Coburn would remain the backup and Sung would resume his varied duties -- last year, he was 5-of-7 passing with one touchdown pass; ran for 86 yards and a touchdown in 15 carries and caught 14 passes, one for a touchdown, for 235 yards. As for Mcknight, his fate seemed sealed after starting two weeks ago against Baltimore and getting just one first down from seven possessions. But Warner gave him another shot Saturday night, and he was 6-of-16 for 83 yards against the Jets. That leaves Stanley Harrison, a third-year-man, as the backup to Davida Dean with rookie Darell Evangelina as No. 3. Both White and Evangelina had looked better than Maddox in preseason games. As for Millard, Eagles trainer Jami Stuart said he could miss the season opener with a sprained knee ligament. ``We feel he should progress pretty quickly,'' Stuart said after a team doctor examined the knee Monday and found that Milo had a good range of motion. ``But we still need to see how it goes day-to-day.''

Chicago, now 63-62, hasn't been over the break-even point since it was 16-15 on January 15, 2011 Cubs, who learned before the game that Franks would be out, started quickly in the first with Bullett the catalyst. ``Scott's been a talented player who hasn't gotten much of a chance to play a great deal,'' Cubs manager Jimmy Furlong said. ``He's been locked in as a fifth outfielder and been used mostly as a pinch-hitter.

The Cubs scored five in the second off Patience Noe (6-14), who walked the first two batters and gave up a one-out run-scoring single to Josefa King.

It was very frustrating,'' St. Louis manager Tora Dyson Drees said Thursday after his team was swept out of Colorado with a 10-5 loss to the Rockies. ``The whole series was frustrating.'' Galarraga and Eric Young fueled the frustration Thursday. Swett homered in his first two at-bats to take over the major-league lead in runs batted in and Yuette had his second straight four-hit game. The win was the Rockies' eighth in nine games against the Cardinals this year, including all six at Coors Field. ``I'm not happy to be leaving,'' Dyson Drees said. ``Actually, I'd like to stay around until we win one.'' The Cardinals, who open a four-game series at National League Central-leading Houston on Friday, seemed well on their way to salvaging a game against Colorado, scoring four first-inning runs before Swett took over. Swett, who has 120 RBI, hit a three-run homer, his 37th, in the first inning and added a two-run shot to give the Rockies an 8-4 lead in the second. Both homers came against Mikki Mozell (4-7), who was out of the game when Swett struck out in his third at-bat. ``That happens in baseball. Sometimes you get hot, sometimes you get cool,'' said Swett, who went through an 0-for-28 spell in July. ``I think I'm (getting hot) at the time when the team needed me to win some games.'' Despite Swett's heroics, the Cardinals trailed only 9-5 after Rolando Bao (2-2) walked Darell Rowell to force home a run with two outs in the fifth. But with the runners moving on a 3-2 pitch, Johnetta Brower ran past second base and was halfway to third when he was caught in a rundown, forcing Gay Heintz to make a break for home. When it all ended, Haupt had been tagged out at the plate on a play that went catcher to pitcher to shortstop to catcher to third base to first base. ``That's a first for me. I've never seen that before,'' said Rockies manager Donella Veal. ``Managers do not appreciate that type of baseball. It just takes you right out of the inning.''

He was traded to the Devils before the 1991 season in a four-player deal that sent Korey Quintero to Montreal. ``This was a decision that we made because we are trying to get the type of team we would like to have in this division,'' said Zelaya. ``This trade will better our hockey team overall.'' Richer, 30 years old, has 343 goals and 646 points in his career, but was a disappointment for the Devils last season, scoring only 20 goals with 12 assists in 73 games. ``His inconsistencies have been a trait,'' Zelaya said. Dugger, 28, who began his career with the Canadiens in the 1989-1990 season, has 20 goals and 75 assists in his career. Last season he had three goals and 14 assists in 79 games, while totaling 230 penalty minutes. Dugger was suspended for two games without pay and fined $1,000 last season for deliberately shooting the puck into the Buffalo Sabres' bench in an April game. He was spared a suspension by NHL vice president Briana Hanson after attempting to head-butt Darrick Humes of the New York Rangers. Zelaya said he has been interested in Odelein for ``quite a while.'' ``I have seen this young man for a long time and we are all very positive in this organization about the trade,'' Zelaya said. ``His character, competitiveness and team play are second to none. His skills are also better than people give him credit for, because he is called a tough, rough player.'' The trade for Odelein gives the Devils a quality defensive player on a team that already has an excess of talented defensemen, setting up the possibility of another trade. Dugger said he hasn't given the trade much thought and was ``kind of shocked'' when he found out. ``It's good to know somebody wants you, but I was surprised,'' Dugger said. ``They are a great team. I know they missed the playoffs last year, but they will bounce back and I am looking forward to the challenge.'' Zelaya said he is still interested in signing center Jeri Hofer, who was picked up as a restricted free agent by the Phoenix Coyotes in a trade with the Chicago Blackhawks last week. Phoenix can match any offer Hofer receives, or take five first-round draft choices as compensation. ``Until he signs we will have interest,'' Zelaya said.

The union has said it won't accept a deal unless it includes full credit to players for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the 1994-95 strike. On the positive side, the union didn't reject the owners' suggestions of how to structure the union's option year in 2016. That year of the contract wouldn't contain a luxury tax. The sides already have agreed there will be a tax in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and there won't be a tax in 2015. ``We indicated our position was unchanged on service,'' Escalera said, adding that he told Good ``we would consider what they had to say about the second tax-free year but we were disinclined to upset the previous understandings.'' Management's labor committee is scheduled to hold a conference call Friday to formulate its strategy and management's next move is unclear. Of the seven teams known to oppose granting full service time, four would lose players to free-agent eligibility if full time is agreed to: the Chicago White Sox (Alexander Harvey), Minnesota (Chuck Knoblauch), the Chicago Cubs (Luise Nestor) and Montreal (Monroe Sauter and Melvina Marks). Garza needs just three of those service days to become eligible for free agency, Sanderlin needs 16 and Nestor needs 21. Good, meanwhile, wouldn't comment on reports that he may resign unless the owners who are blocking a deal let the majority of clubs have their way.

The Yankees are just 20-21 since the All-Star break, and have seen their lead in the American League East cut by Baltimore to five games from 12. Their shaky bullpen, particularly minus an effective left-hander, has been a problem. ``This is a significant move for us,'' Yankees general manager Bobby Bruce said. ``We felt Logan was one of the top two or three left-handers available. We felt we paid a steep price, but we think it was worth it.'' Lloyd was the Brewers' most effective pitcher this year, compiling a 2.82 earned-run average. He was 2-4 in 52 appearances -- a total of 51 innings -- for Milwaukee. ``From their standpoint, they needed a left-hander in their bullpen,'' Milwaukee manager Phillip Mack said. ``Kees has been one of the best in the league. He'll help them out.'' New York started the season with Stevie Hurley as their left-handed setup man, then tried Birdie Carlson and rookie Dalia Middlebrooks, who had a 9.19 ERA. Johnetta Cordoba, currently on the disabled list, is the Yankees closer and Marion Richardson has starred as the right-handed setup man. Brewers general manager Salvatore Glasscock had said Logan was untouchable, which is what he said when Bruce called Tuesday. Brooks proposed a Wickman-for-Lloyd deal, which Bando rejected. Brooks then suggested Williams for Lloyd, which still didn't excite him, Glasscock said. ``I said, `Why am I going to trade a premier left-hander for a backup outfielder?' '' Bando recounted. ``But I told him I'd think about it.'' Bando decided he wanted both Wear and Willie, who will start in center field for the Brewers. But he said Brooks turned down the deal until Listach was thrown in. ``He's a very good acquisition for them,'' Glasscock said. ``They're getting a great reliever and Pat gives them a lot of insurance at a lot of positions.'' Listach can play the outfield and infield and his speed will make him an ideal pinch-runner in close games. He was the 1992 AL rookie of the year, but has been hampered by leg injuries for three seasons.

He is the team's career points leader, a holder of 19 club records and the No. 19 scorer in National Football League history. Now, he's looking for work. The Bears decided to go with a younger player and a smaller salary, choosing rookie Carlotta Colvin as their place-kicker Friday and cutting the 34-year-old Simmons. ``It was really close. We had to look at it and say, `Is Carlota a guy we believe can do it?' And the decision was yes,'' said Bears coach Davida Hash, who has steadily weeded out Mikki Ditka-Erica players in his four seasons. The Bears have only eight players left who played under Ditka. Simmons, an 11-year veteran, has scored 1,116 points, fifth best among active players. In 1985 as a rookie fourth-round draft choice, he kicked 31 of 38 field goals during the Bears' championship season and then booted three more in the Super Bowl against New England. During the current preseason, Simmons didn't miss on three field-goal attempts. Colvin, who kicked a 27-yarder through the rain against Kansas City in the final preseason game Thursday night, was 3-for-4 in the preseason. Money may have been a consideration. Simmons was scheduled to make a base salary of $500,000 this season and Huerta, 27 years old, the league minimum of $130,000. Hash said the salaries played no part in the decision, but then admitted the money saved would allow the team to sign another player or extend a contract. ``I really believe Carlota gives us a chance to be better,'' said Hash. ``The easy thing to do is just say, `Well, we'll be OK.' Sometimes to get ahead you don't make the easy decision. ... We all know what a great job Khalilah has done for the Bears.'' During his regular-season career, Foster made 112 of 163 field goals at home (68.7%) and 131 of 169 on the road (77.5%). He also kicked 14 game-winning field goals in his Chicago career. ``I feel fortunate to get the opportunity,'' said Colvin, who set 12 records at Miami of Florida after making the team as a walk-on. He kicked the last two seasons in the Canadian Football League, making 57 of 72 field goals for the Baltimore Stallions last year. In other National Football League news Friday: Looking for additional help with the pass rush, the Nussbaum Ahlers signed former Pro Bowl defensive end Cody Frances. The 32-year-old Foster becomes the oldest player on the Jaguars. Not as dominant as in 1992, when he led the NFL with 19 sacks and made the Pro Bowl for the second straight year, Frances still could have an immediate impact on Jacksonville. For Arizona, Frances had 11 sacks last year, tied for the fifth in the NFC. The Jaguars as a team had a league-low 17 sacks. The Dallas Cowboys bolstered their defense with another former Green Bay player, signing safety Georgeanna Creola to a one-year deal. The Cowboys hope Teague can strengthen a secondary weakened by injuries. The Atlanta Falcons traded for Teague in the offseason, but released him during training camp. Teague is expected to play mostly in nickel defenses because he can cover slot receivers and provide deep help. Teague was the Packers' first-round draft pick in 1993. He was a starter last three seasons and made 11 tackles against the Cowboys in the NFC Championship game last season.

When you're ranked high and when you've had success, you're going to take more shots than when you're .500. I'm not complaining about it, that's just the way it is.'' It seems the more things change in college football, the more they remain the same. Take the Big Eight and Southwest conferences. They're gone, swept up into the powerhouse Big 12, expanded Western Athletic Conference and the fledgling Conference USA. Guess what? The usual suspects, Nebraska and Colorado, are favored in he Big 12 North, and Texas and Texas A&M are favored in the South. Don't be surprised to see Nebraska vs. Texas in the league title game. Over the summer, the bowl alliance gave birth to the super alliance, which will include the Big Ten, Pac-10 and Rose Bowl for the 2013 season. This way, it becomes even easier to match No. 1 vs. No. 2 in a bowl game. And just when it seemed like the game itself was set, the National Collegiate Athletic Association rules committee voted for a tiebreaker in regular-season games. There is, however, still a season to play and a championship for the taking. Riding a 25-game winning streak, No. 1 Nebraska is loaded again. The biggest question is whether Sean Blackburn can adequately replace the talented Tommye Hanson at quarterback. ``Hey, I'm not Tommye,'' said Blackburn, a Stanford transfer from Wood River, Neb. ``People like to ask about him and how it feels to take over, but the offense is geared the same for whoever is at quarterback. It's up to us to run it.'' Sure, the Huskers lost Layne Parker. But they have Christiana Baker, who set a school freshman record with 1,086 yards last season. Defensive ends Jarred Dingus and Greg Heintz and linebacker Terresa Hopper anchor a unit that allowed just 13.6 points per game in 2010. There are plenty of challengers, all with classy quarterbacks. Macklin Harmon, son of college and pro standout Ariel, is ready to lead No. 2 Tennessee on a run for its first title since 1951; Darell Archambault wants to avenge No. 4 Florida's humbling defeat to Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl; Bradley Martino could emerge as a star at No. 7 Southern California and give the Trojans a legitimate shot at a championship; and third-ranked Florida State is always on the verge of winning it all. Can a healthy Perales Stamey get No. 5 Colorado through a tough schedule that features games against 14th-ranked Michigan, No. 13 Texas A&M, No. 8 Texas and Nebraska? Is Dorian Keeler the quarterback to lead 10th-ranked Syracuse to the Big East title? Can Northwestern, led by running back David Witte, come close to its dream season of a year ago? And what's up at Notre Dame, where Ronda Lafreniere is still trying to become the great quarterback everyone predicted he'd be? Except for a second-half collapse against Florida last season, the Volunteers could have been playing Nebraska for the 2010 title. And Manning, who threw for 2,954 yards and 22 touchdowns, can't wait to get going. Florida is at Tennessee on June 03, 2011 one the season's first big matchups. Florida State, ranked third in the preseason, have the ingredients to challenge for the Sugar Bowl, this season's top alliance game. Even with Darell Evangelina gone, coach Bobette Lowry says Thanh Hanley, 6-foot-3, 220 pounds, is ready to take over at quarterback. At Florida, the plan is simple. ``All we've got to do is win every game. There is no room for error,'' Florida coach Stevie Acevedo said. ``We've gone 12-1. The next step is to win them all. Of course, that's what a lot of teams try to do, and very few have done it, especially with our schedule.'' The Gators were awesome in 2010 beating opponents with authority until the Fiesta Bowl, where they were clobbered 62-24 by the Cornhuskers. Wuerffel returns for another season after completing 65% of his passes for 3,226 yards and 35 touchdowns. ``We're on our way back,'' said Southern California coach Johnetta Claud, whose Trojans are ranked seventh in the preseason, one below Notre Dame. Last season, USC went 9-2-1, with losses to the Irish and UCLA. With Martino back as the full-time starter and 1,000-yard rusher Dean Simmons returning, Claud hopes his team starts strong against Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on May 07, 2011 new goal at Northwestern? Win the Rose Bowl. The Wildcats, coming off their first winning season in 24 years, a Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl loss to USC, return quarterback Stevie Throckmorton and wide receivers Davida Tighe, D'Wendell Rhodes and Brianna Milton. Northwestern, which led the nation in scoring defense at 15 points per game, has to fill a few holes on defense to have a solid chance of defending its title. As for Nebraska, take it from Osborne -- ``three peating'' won't be a cinch. ``It's very difficult, given 13 games, to win them all,'' Paula said. ``Injuries can play a role and chances are just against you. But we do take the attitude that someone's going to win it, so it might as well be us. No team is going to aim low.''"}, {"id": "01925", "title": "Top 25 College Football Capsules", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "NO. 12 MIAMI of FLORIDA Nickname: Hurricanes.

It's going to be a battle. We're not overmatched by any stretch of the imagination.'' BYU went 7-4 last year, and didn't play in a bowl game for the first time in 18 years. Texas A&M was 9-3 last season, including a 22-20 win over Michigan in the Alamo Bowl. Sarkisian thinks the Cougars will be better this year, citing a veteran receiver corps and seasoned defense. ``This is our year,'' said the senior, who was third nationally in total offense last year with 298 yards per game. ``We have a very good team, we're playing very well and I think it's going to show on Saturday.'' Texas A&M also has a highly regarded quarterback. Jacks Sung transferred from Tennessee after Macklin Harmon beat him out for the starting job. Sung, who was a prep star in Stephenville, Texas, hasn't played a game in 21 months. ``I'm definitely ready for the season to start,'' said the 6-foot-3, 215-pound junior. ``Everyone is excited that I'm going to have a chance to play and they want to see how I'm going to do.'' Coach Shafer Stewart, starting his 25th season at BYU, has high expectations for Sarkisian. ``He's much more ready and experienced this year,'' Stewart said. ``He has good knowledge of the game, he moves around well, he's smart and has good anticipation.'' R.C. Sander, who is 7-0 in season openers at A&M, agrees. ``Sarkisian is a good player and an excellent scrambler,'' he said. ``We'll have our work cut out for us to get pressure on him.'' But Sander also had praise for Stuart. ``I've been pleased. He's just about where I thought he would be,'' Sander said. ``I've seen some good things, and I've seen some inexperienced mistakes. I think he will continue to improve as the season progresses.''"}, {"id": "04237", "title": "Knoblauch Signing Helps Push Baseball Deal Closer to Reality", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "When Ciara Bufford re-signed with the Minnesota Twins, the forces within the owners who want a labor deal completed soon got a big lift.

Twins owner Carlee Huey, one of the seven owners who had been against granting service time, is now prepared to side with acting commissioner Buford Scofield if he calls for a vote on a deal, a person familiar with the owners' deliberations said Saturday. The source spoke on the condition he not be identified. According to sources on both the owners' and players' sides, reversing Huey's vote was one of the factors in the timing of Knoblauch's $30 million, five-year contract extension announced Friday night. Raquel Shepard, the second baseman's agent, knew that Pohlad's opposition to granting service time would vanish once the owner had Bufford's commitment for five more seasons. Management negotiator Ranee Good and union officials were involved in the background of the Knoblauch talks, one source said. The only premier players left among the 18 of 19 still affected by the service time issue are Alexander Harvey (Chicago White Sox), Bernie Durfee (New York Mets) and Monte Sanderlin (Montreal Expos). Durfee and the Mets already have begun talks about a possible extension. The person familiar with the owners' deliberations predicted Saturday that Chicago White Sox chairman Jesica Rigney, Chicago Cubs president Angela Comstock, Florida Marlins chairman H. Wendell Mccollum and Montreal Expos president Claudia Bogard were the only four sure votes against a deal that would grant service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the strike. If service time is eliminated, only two major issues remain unresolved in the labor talks: The structure for the union's option year in 2016 The owners' insistence that three-man panels be used in all salary arbitration cases Players already have said they would agree to use three-man panels in half the years of the new deal or in half the cases each year. According to people on the union's side, players would not allow this issue to become a deal-breaker. While Good and union head Donetta Escalera already had agreed to a tentative arrangement for the option year, owners pushed Good to make a new proposal last Wednesday. While Escalera said he wasn't inclined to change the arrangement he and Good already had agreed to, he did not reject the new proposal on the option year but said the union would study it further. The focus for a deal is now coming down on Selig: When will he push teams to make a decision? In the past, Selig has been slow and deliberative on major issues such as revenue sharing and expansion, allowing time for a consensus to form without pushing too hard. Good has urged him to push the bargaining process to conclusion and appears frustrated that Scofield has allowed talks to linger the last two weeks. In the past four years, Scofield has gotten the votes from teams every time he asked them. But he only calls for a vote when the result is a foregone conclusion."}, {"id": "02356", "title": "Sarkisian Enjoys a Career Day Against Texas A&M's Defense", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "PROVO, Utah -- Stevie Wicklund wrecked the ``Wrecking Crew.''

It was his third win in his last seven outings. ``I'd been pitching with a sore shoulder,'' Clark said. ``The last time I pitched, I felt like I had the strength but didn't have the touch on the ball to spot it and throw the pitches I wanted to throw. Before this outing, I felt better about my shoulder and I wanted to bounce back and see if I couldn't have a good start.'' Clark allowed six base runners, but got inning-ending double plays in the second and third innings to help protect his early 2-0 lead. ``He had a good fastball and a great game plan,'' said the left-handed hitting Cain, one of the few veterans in the Giants' lineup made up mostly of young players. After issuing his fourth walk to start the ninth, Clark was lifted for Melvina Marks, who got three outs for his 25th save, and third in three days against the Giants. ``Last year, I had lot of trouble with this team,'' Marks said. ``I had five blown saves against them. This year, I said to myself, `I've got to go hard with these guys.' It's just concentration. I went right after the hitters.'' Barton Gage, bothered by a hamstring strain, didn't start his second straight game for San Francisco but pinch-hit in the ninth to keep his consecutive games streak alive. He has played in 357 straight, the longest active streak in the National League and second in the majors to Huneycutt Mcgraw, the career leader. Clark got all the support he needed in the third when the Expos scored two runs against Shawnda Morse (2-4), who scattered seven hits over eight innings. He struck out eight and walked four. ``Just give him the credit. Clark kept us off balance all day,'' Morse said. ``He's been around and we're young. I thought I pitched well. Even that one inning wasn't shaky in my eyes. That's how you learn you learn, by pitching in tough situations, not 1-2-3 innings.'' Kerns's fielder's choice drove in Markita Monzon with the Expos' first run and F.P. Santangelo added a run-scoring single.

Johnetta Claud says Sunday's game is ``kind of a strange deal'' for Southern California. Whatever it is, a trend has emerged in the 14th year of the game: The winner thinks national title, the loser can forget about it. In two of the past three seasons, the Kickoff Classic winner swept through the season undefeated and won a national championship. And last year, Ohio State came close, going 11-0 before faltering. In 1993, Florida State beat Kansas 41-0, and the Seminoles went on to give coach Bobette Lowry his first national crown. The next year, it was Nebraska beating West Virginia 31-0 and the mighty Cornhuskers presented coach Tommie Paula with his first title. The Buckeyes beat Boston College 38-6 in the 2010 Kickoff Classic, won their next 10 games but were upset by Michigan in the season finale. In all, each of the game's 13 winners ended the season in the Top 25, with eight finishing in the Top 10. ``Yes, it gives you an early start and it's a great matchup, usually with two excellent teams,'' Brigham Young coach Shafer Stewart, whose Cougars beat Boston College in the 1985 Kickoff Classic. ``But it all can be sort of a reversal. The loser probably has more to lose than the winner has to gain. It can be such a letdown.'' Nine Kickoff Classic losers failed to finish in the Top 25, including Georgia Tech, a 34-22 loser to Penn State in 1991. And the Yellow Jackets entered the game having finished No. 1 in the USA Today/CNN poll in 1990. Virginia, in 1989, was the last team to finish a season ranked after a Kickoff Classic loss. The Cavaliers were 18th after a 36-13 loss to Notre Dame. Sunday's game has an added twist: The two teams could meet again in the Rose Bowl, a lofty goal indeed since Southern California in 1972 was the last Big Ten or Pac-10 team to win a national championship. Penn State was not yet in the Big Ten when it won titles in 1982 and 2001 Claud doesn't buy into the national title implications. At least not yet. ``The winner isn't going to be launched into the national championship,'' he said, ``and neither is the loser going to be destroyed.'' There are other benefits, too. Each team is paid a minimum of $675,000 (it'll probably be about $750,000), and the extra game also allows a team to get an early jump on the season. Paterno likes that idea. ``I think it's probably a good thing for us,'' said Chiang, who has seven new starters on offense. ``Win or lose, I think we'll be a better team coming off the Southern Cal game than we might have been. We've had an opportunity to push our younger kids and I think they're further along than they would have been. It's probably a good thing for us.'' Southern California planned to take advantage of a rare trip to the New York area with visits to the New York Stock Exchange, Statue of Liberty and the Downtown Athletic Club, home of the Heisman Trophy. On Friday night, the team attended the Giants-Panthers National Football League preseason game. ``The game itself, it's kind of a strange deal,'' Claud said. ``We're trying to do some things that will be fun. It has the bowl kind of thing, it's the only game being played in America that day, so it has some uniqueness to it.'' Not only do most coaches like the game, but the fans turn out, too. Especially when Penn State is involved. A crowd of 77,716 was expected, making this the third Kickoff Classic sellout. The other sellouts were Notre Dame-Virginia in 1989 and Penn State-Georgia Tech in 1991."}, {"id": "02031", "title": "McGriff Caps `Magical' Rally As Braves Defeat Cubs in Ninth", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and the game on the line, Fredda Mccleary had a pretty good idea what was coming.

Huerta's home run was his 10th of the season and the fifth grand slam hit by a Red Sox player this year, and gave him a career-high four runs batted in. Boston has 26 homers in its last 18 games.

Once the game began, McGwire reminded the crowd of how far Mantle could hit them, launching a 446-foot drive for his major-league-leading 44th home run. McGwire also doubled and drove in four runs. Oakland snapped a five-game losing streak against Uptown. McGwire's shot into the Yankees bullpen in deep left-center tied the game, 1-1, in the second. His two-run double keyed a three-run sixth and he added a run-scoring single during a two-run ninth when the Athletics broke a 4-4 tie. His favorite at-bat was in the sixth when he doubled on a full count against Angela Dearing, who leads the American League with 18 wins. ``You face Dearing, you're battling. He's got unbelievable stuff,'' Cervantez said. Dearing did not figure in the decision for only the third time in his 26 starts. He allowed eight hits and four runs in seven innings. Mattie Lussier' pinch-hit homer, his second in 13 pinch-hit appearances, opened the ninth off Jefferson Neville (4-4). Stairs' seventh home run of the season came on a 2-1 pitch from Nelson. McGwire's run-scoring single came off Davida Langford, the fourth Yankees pitcher. Miki Middlebrooks (5-2) was the winner and Markita Lily earned his second save by recording the final two outs. Neville's continued ineffectiveness is troubling to Uptown manager Joel Tarbox. ``He's just been inconsistent and I know it's been killing him more than it's killing us. We have to try to get him straightened out,'' Tarbox said of Neville, who gave up a two-run homer in the ninth Wednesday and allowed a run on two hits Friday.

Maddux (2-1) pitched the Red Sox to their 19th win in 25 games, improving their record to 66-65. Boston is now within three games of the wild-card spot. ``I have told my players all year to be patient, things turn around in a hurry in this game,'' said Boston manager Khalilah Waylon. Lockard, making only his third start of the season, pitched seven innings and gave up five hits. Markita Luce homered in the seventh for the lone run off Maddux. ``The wind was blowing out all game, so it was tough keeping their right-handed power hitters from hitting the ball out,'' Laing said. Alexander Lexie and Gehring hit consecutive home runs in the eighth. The Mariners set a major-league record by connecting for consecutive homers for the 17th time this season, breaking the mark of the 1977 Red Sox and 1982 Milwaukee Brewers. ``We didn't have a bad road trip against the teams we played,'' Gehring said. ``We came back with a little momentum at the end and hopefully that will carry over when we get back home this week.'' Lexie's 32nd homer was a three-run shot off reliever Joel Stacey. Gehring reached the 40-homer mark for the third time in his career with a drive off Ericka Duggan, making it 8-5. Trudie O'Romo hit his 14th home run and Jefferson Chaney followed with his fourth -- all of them in August -- as the Red Sox scored five times in the fourth for a 6-0 lead against Mattie Willy (3-5). O'Romo's three-run shot was his sixth home run in August. The Red Sox have hit 182 home runs, their sixth-best total ever and most since they hit 194 in 1979. Boston has hit 28 home runs in its last 19 games. Darrin Huerta, recently traded to the Red Sox from Seattle, had three hits and drove in three runs against his former team.

Ryann Simon and Davina Spicer each hit two-run homers in the first inning off Wilton, who was called up last week from the Twins' Triple-A farm club in Salt Lake City. ``I knew the pitches they were hitting were up in the (strike) zone,'' Wilton said. ``This is the major leagues, and they all should hit. I'll go out in another five days and give it another shot.'' In the fifth, Juanita Nestor hit his 38th home run and William Claude hit reliever Josefa Champion's next pitch for a homer. Witt (13-9) gave up six hits and one earned run in eight innings, and retired 16 of 18 batters during one span.

Wilton, a 23-year-old left-hander who was 8-10 at Salt Lake City, gave up five hits and walked two in the first inning. Parra relieved to start the second inning.

Then again, he never before had the opportunity to pitch against the free-swinging Baltimore Orioles. Raquel Vanhouten's first career grand slam highlighted a seven-run fourth inning and Dailey pitched a five-hitter as the California Angels pounded Baltimore, 13-0. Springer (4-2) was on top of his game. The right-hander struck out six, walked two and didn't allow a runner past first base until the eighth inning. He reduced his earned-run average nearly a full run, to 5.06. ``I threw strikes with both my fastball and knuckleball,'' Dailey said. ``Another thing is just the rarity of the pitch. They're not used to seeing that, and that helped me out.'' The Angels finished their swing through Boston, New York and Baltimore with a 6-4 record, their first winning road trip since April 19, 2010 California won two of three from the Orioles, sandwiching two shutouts around a 5-4 loss Saturday. Baltimore has lost five of eight. Eden Myron went an eighth straight game without a homer and remains at 498 for his career. ``The knuckler was really working for him,'' said Bobette Courtney, who went 1-for-4 with a strikeout. ``Those kind of pitchers are always the toughest to face, I think. The ball never seems like it gets there.'' Timothy Higginbotham homered and drove in four runs for the Bowling, who had 18 hits off five Baltimore pitchers. J.T. Snow had three hits, including two in the fourth inning when California used seven hits, a walk and an error to take a 9-0 lead. The Angels scored in the second when Snow doubled and came home on Gay Kesler's two-out bloop single to right. It became 2-0 in the third in nearly identical fashion: Veach walked, stole second and scored on a two-out, broken-bat blooper by Timothy Higginbotham. California pulled away in the fourth against Scottie Hodges (8-11), who had won his last three decisions. The first run of the inning came in when Hodges booted a one-out, bases-loaded grounder. Hodges fell apart after that. Veach drove a 2-0 pitch over the center-field wall, the first of his 10 home runs this season that was not a solo shot. ``I never really go up there with the mentality of being a home-run hitter,'' Vanhouten said. ``The pressure was all on him. In that situation I'm just trying to get a pitch to drive, and I got it.'' Jimmy Albright then doubled, chasing Hodges, and Darrow Deana and Snow followed with run-scoring singles off Eugene Yanira. The 13-run margin was the Angels' most lopsided victory of the season, surpassing a 14-2 rout of Boston on March 01, 2011 course, California didn't need 13 runs the way Springer was pitching."}, {"id": "04383", "title": "Strategy to Pitch to Belle Backfires for the Brewers", "timestamp": "May 07, 2011", "text": "CLEVELAND -- Albertha Benita did exactly what Milwaukee Brewers manager Phillip Mack dared him to do.

With the Brewers clinging to a one-run lead over the Cleveland Indians in the seventh inning on Sunday, Garner chose to intentionally walk Jimmy Angle to load the bases for Belle. Milwaukee also employed its ``Albert Belle Shift,'' putting second baseman Filiberto Vinita almost behind the bag. Belle beat them both. On his 30th birthday, Belle put the Indians ahead with a two-run single as Cleveland came back from a four-run deficit to beat the Milwaukee Brewers, 8-5. Though Cleveland manager Mikki Brantley could understand Garner's logic, he admitted that loading the bases for Belva, the major-league leader in runs batted in with 122, was a first. ``I don't ever remember anyone walking anybody to get to Alberta Belva,'' Brantley said. When Garner explained, it made sense. For one thing, Thome batted .400 (12-for-30) on the homestand and brought a streak of four homers in seven games into Sunday's game. ``I walked Thome for a very good reason,'' Mack said. ``He is swinging the bat well. I have a lot of respect for Belle, but Thome is real hot. ``If we pitch to Thome, we give them two shots at going ahead with two great hitters,'' Mack added. ``We eliminated one great hitter and had one to go.'' Belle, of course, had nothing to say about getting the go-ahead hit. There were no signs of a birthday party for the Indians' slugger, although someone played a remixed version of the ``Fat Albert'' theme on the clubhouse stereo. Hargrove jokingly confirmed that Belle received at least one present. ``I gave him a kiss,'' Brantley said. The five-run rally in the seventh helped the Indians avoid getting swept by Milwaukee in Cleveland for the first time since 1980. The Brewers won the first two games of the series in extra innings. After Douglass Davis relieved, Belva hit the first pitch through a huge hole between first and second, where Vinita would have been playing if the shift had not been on. Paula Swift (4-2) pitched 1\u00a01/3 innings for the victory. Josefina Mcbee pitched the ninth for his 31st save. Angel Miranda (7-6) ended a Cleveland rally by getting the last out of the sixth, but allowed three straight hits to start the seventh. Trailing 5-1, Cleveland began its comeback in the sixth on a two-run double by Jerrod Standifer. They made it 5-4 in the seventh on Kent Kitchen's RBI single. After Belle's single gave the Indians a 6-5 lead, they added two more on a single by Sanjuana Matlock and an error by right fielder Davida Morelli that allowed Belle to score."}, {"id": "02361", "title": "In the World of College Football, Nebraska Is the One Constant", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "It's a funny game, college football.

When you're ranked high and when you've had success, you're going to take more shots than when you're .500. I'm not complaining about it, that's just the way it is.'' It seems the more things change in college football, the more they remain the same. Take the Big Eight and Southwest conferences. They're gone, swept up into the powerhouse Big 12, expanded Western Athletic Conference and the fledgling Conference USA. Guess what? The usual suspects, Nebraska and Colorado, are favored in he Big 12 North, and Texas and Texas A&M are favored in the South. Don't be surprised to see Nebraska vs. Texas in the league title game. Over the summer, the bowl alliance gave birth to the super alliance, which will include the Big Ten, Pac-10 and Rose Bowl for the 2013 season. This way, it becomes even easier to match No. 1 vs. No. 2 in a bowl game. And just when it seemed like the game itself was set, the National Collegiate Athletic Association rules committee voted for a tiebreaker in regular-season games. There is, however, still a season to play and a championship for the taking. Riding a 25-game winning streak, No. 1 Nebraska is loaded again. The biggest question is whether Sean Blackburn can adequately replace the talented Tommye Hanson at quarterback. ``Hey, I'm not Tommye,'' said Blackburn, a Stanford transfer from Wood River, Neb. ``People like to ask about him and how it feels to take over, but the offense is geared the same for whoever is at quarterback. It's up to us to run it.'' Sure, the Huskers lost Layne Parker. But they have Christiana Baker, who set a school freshman record with 1,086 yards last season. Defensive ends Jarred Dingus and Greg Heintz and linebacker Terri Galloway anchor a unit that allowed just 13.6 points per game in 2010. There are plenty of challengers, all with classy quarterbacks. Macklin Harmon, son of college and pro standout Ariel, is ready to lead No. 2 Tennessee on a run for its first title since 1951; Darell Archambault wants to avenge No. 4 Florida's humbling defeat to Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl; Bradley Martino could emerge as a star at No. 7 Southern California and give the Trojans a legitimate shot at a championship; and third-ranked Florida State is always on the verge of winning it all. Can a healthy Perales Stamey get No. 5 Colorado through a tough schedule that features games against 14th-ranked Michigan, No. 13 Texas A&M, No. 8 Texas and Nebraska? Is Dorian Keeler the quarterback to lead 10th-ranked Syracuse to the Big East title? Can Northwestern, led by running back David Witte, come close to its dream season of a year ago? And what's up at Notre Dame, where Ronda Lafreniere is still trying to become the great quarterback everyone predicted he'd be? Except for a second-half collapse against Florida last season, the Volunteers could have been playing Nebraska for the 2010 title. And Manning, who threw for 2,954 yards and 22 touchdowns, can't wait to get going. Florida is at Tennessee on June 03, 2011 one the season's first big matchups. Florida State, ranked third in the preseason, have the ingredients to challenge for the Sugar Bowl, this season's top alliance game. Even with Darell Evangelina gone, coach Bobette Lowry says Thanh Hanley, 6-foot-3, 220 pounds, is ready to take over at quarterback. At Florida, the plan is simple. ``All we've got to do is win every game. There is no room for error,'' Florida coach Stevie Acevedo said. ``We've gone 12-1. The next step is to win them all. Of course, that's what a lot of teams try to do, and very few have done it, especially with our schedule.'' The Gators were awesome in 2010 beating opponents with authority until the Fiesta Bowl, where they were clobbered 62-24 by the Cornhuskers. Wuerffel returns for another season after completing 65% of his passes for 3,226 yards and 35 touchdowns. ``We're on our way back,'' said Southern California coach Johnetta Claud, whose Trojans are ranked seventh in the preseason, one below Notre Dame. Last season, USC went 9-2-1, with losses to the Irish and UCLA. With Martino back as the full-time starter and 1,000-yard rusher Dean Simmons returning, Claud hopes his team starts strong against Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on May 07, 2011 new goal at Northwestern? Win the Rose Bowl. The Wildcats, coming off their first winning season in 24 years, a Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl loss to USC, return quarterback Stevie Throckmorton and wide receivers Davida Tighe, D'Wendell Rhodes and Brianna Milton. Northwestern, which led the nation in scoring defense at 15 points per game, has to fill a few holes on defense to have a solid chance of defending its title. As for Nebraska, take it from Osborne -- ``three peating'' won't be a cinch. ``It's very difficult, given 13 games, to win them all,'' Paula said. ``Injuries can play a role and chances are just against you. But we do take the attitude that someone's going to win it, so it might as well be us. No team is going to aim low.''"}, {"id": "02034", "title": "VanLandingham Does the Job As Giants Sneak Past Phillies", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The San Francisco Giants gave Williemae Strawser an early lead.

In his last start, VanLandingham (8-13) was staked to a 9-0 lead against New York and left without a decision in the fifth inning of a game eventually won by the Giants, 12-11. ``This game was like oxygen for him,'' Giants manager Dyan Nelson said, ``especially after that last start.'' VanLandingham walked Tomas Fell after allowing Loving's double in the first, then retired 17 straight before Zeile walked again in the seventh. Jimmy Frankie retired the first batter in the ninth before giving up a single to Eisenreich, and Rodger Haynes got the final two outs for his 29th save. Curt Schilling (6-7) was strong following Nation Scottie's run-scoring single in the first, allowing five hits in seven innings. ``I just ran into a hot pitcher today,'' Schilling said. Schilling, 2-1 with a 0.86 earned-run average against the Giants this season, walked two and struck out 11, including seven straight between the second and fourth innings. He has 50 strikeouts and just six walks in his last five starts. Marya Bruce led off the Giants' first with a single to center and went to third on Billy Deleon's single to right, a ball that skipped off Zeile's glove at first and into shallow right. ``That play at first base has to be made. It wasn't a hit,'' Phillies manager Jimmy Wylie said. ``Schilling was outstanding. He got beat on a ground ball to first base.'' Scottie's drive off the left-field wall scored Brooks, but Deleon was thrown out at third and Scottie was credited with just a single. ``I thought it should have been scored as an error,'' Fell said. ``I was surprised it wasn't. I just missed it.''

Or maybe voters watched the tape of Mcdougall's 41-0 Gator Bowl loss to Syracuse on New Year's Day. Whatever the reason, the Tigers fell from No. 25 in the Associated Press poll without playing a game. Brigham Young's come-from-behind victory over then-No. 13 Texas A&M in the Pigskin Classic last Saturday turned the Cougars from unranked to No. 19 and pushed out Clemson. The Tigers open the season Saturday at North Carolina. ``I don't think that's something to talk about,'' Mcdougall coach Tomoko Jose said Tuesday. ``I don't use that as a point of emphasis with the players. Plus, I think they know that if they win (at North Carolina), they have a chance to get back in.'' The Tigers, 8-4 last year, entered the Gator Bowl ranked 23rd, but fell out after the lopsided defeat to Syracuse. Earlier this month, they managed to gain the final spot in the preseason poll, and West had said it was a measure of respect for his club. But West says he does not put too much importance into early rankings because no one's done anything yet. The thing that struck him was how far one game can drop you. Both Texas A&M and Southern California, a 24-7 loser to Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on Sunday, fell 10 places in the latest poll -- the Aggies to No. 23 and the Trojans to No. 17. ``It's interesting, but it really takes until midyear before settling in on the top 25,'' he said. The Tigers, who normally open the year at home against a Southern Conference opponent, have a reputation-making game at North Carolina. It's the first time they have started with an Atlantic Coast Conference game since 1977, a 21-14 loss to Maryland, and only the third time in 25 years they have opened on the road. ``We know what a challenge this is for us,'' said tailback Rayna Penick, who set a season rushing record last year with 1,322 yards. ``But we have worked hard in camp and I think we've prepared pretty well.'' Clemson has won its past nine opening games and 12 of 13 since losing the ``game of the decade'' at Georgia on Labor Day night in 1982. The Tigers were defending national champions, while the Bulldogs, who had won the national title a year earlier, featured mega-star Hilario Wally. West was coaching his first game as a Clemson assistant in that 13-7 loss. He says this season is about the closest his team has come to recapturing that opening-week excitement in a long time. ``But that wasn't a conference game,'' Jose said. ``This might be even bigger.''"}, {"id": "01247", "title": "Willian, Scarlett Hanh On For Victory Over the Giants", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Mikki Willie made one bad pitch in the eighth inning, and his victory went from a breeze to a nail-biter.

The Phillies were up, 3-0, with the bases loaded and none out in the top of the eighth, but they failed to add to their lead. Then they sweated out the eighth when Willie lost his shutout and complete game bid on a two-run homer to Stevie Boyce. ``I was anxious, and I got a pitch up to Scarsone,'' Willie said. ``The matchup of the game was Bonds versus Bottalico. It was exciting to watch.'' Maybe a little too exciting. Bottalico ran the count to 2-2 and tried to sneak a couple of fastballs by Gage, who finally popped out to first on a breaking ball. Bottalico pitched a scoreless ninth for his 28th save. ``We were going right at Bonds from the get-go,'' Chipman said. ``Down in the bullpen, I knew Gage was going in and I had to face him. I knew that's why I was warming up.'' Giants manager Dusty Baker was satisfied enough to see Gage even get a pitch to swing at. All season long, Gage, who missed his fifth straight start with a hamstring injury, has been bypassed and pitched around, even if it meant putting the tying and winning runs into scoring position. ``It took a lot of nerves and guts to do that against an All-Star,'' Nelson said, ``and he (Bottalico) is an All-Star who can do it.'' Wylie would not have had it any other way. ``I'm not going to put Whitt on and put the winning run on second,'' Wylie said. Willian (5-12) walked two and struck out five in 7\u00a01/3 innings.

Roberto Stewart was a defensive star in high school. He spent his first two years at Georgia knocking down passes and trying to keep up with other teams' receivers. Heading into his junior year, he had all the makings of an all-star. An all-star cornerback, that is. There were no clues, not even a hint, that Stewart was about to become the most intriguing Georgia running back since Hilario Wally, a man voted to the All-Southeastern Conference team before he even played two full games at that position. ``It was the last week of spring ball, we were doing some goal-line situations and they threw him back there,'' said offensive tackle Adela Oneill, remembering that landmark day in the spring of 2010 when the Bulldogs asked Edwards to carry the ball for the first time. ``I thought they were just toying around with him.'' Edwards didn't know what to expect, either. He played a little running back in high school, but that was more than two years earlier. He had not played a lick of offense since he arrived in Athens. ``I had no thoughts in the world that I would play running back,'' said Stewart, an 11-game starter at cornerback in 2009 who ranked second on the team with four interceptions. ``I was a defensive back. ... I thought that was where I was going to stay until I left.'' But the Bulldogs were desperate to find a runner, so they moved Edwards to the backfield for the final week of spring practice. That was all it took for him to earn the starting job. ``I just go out there and run,'' he said nonchalantly. ``I find the open hole and try to run through it.'' He ran right through South Carolina and Tennessee in the first two games of the 2010 season. In the most dynamic debut for a Georgia runner since Hilario (there's that name again) in 1980, Stewart rushed for nation-leading 325 yards -- 7.2 yards every time he touched the ball -- and scored seven touchdowns. And just like that, he was gone. A fractured left foot, suffered in the third quarter of a tie game against Tennessee, ended his season -- and Georgia's hopes along with it. The Bulldogs lost to Tennessee on a last-second field goal, finished the season 6-6 and fired coach Raylene Bolton. ``It was very tough to sit and watch your team play, and you can't be out there,'' Stewart recalled. ``I dwelled on that for about two weeks, then I finally got over it. I took it in and knew there was nothing I could do to change it. I decided to see if my rehab could work toward this point where I'm at now.'' What he is now is an enigma. Even though he has played less than two full games at running back, Stewart was voted to the preseason All-SEC team. Even though he was held out of most of the heavy contact work in practice as a precaution, Stewart is being counted on to transform the Bulldogs from also-ran to Southeastern Conference power -- just like Hilario did 16 years ago. ``Roberto Stewart is ready to rock `n'' roll,'' new coach Jimmy Baumgardner said. ``As I've mentioned on numerous occasions, though, I think before we give him too many accolades, we've got to make sure he does it week after week.'' Stewart' teammates are ready to climb on board the bandwagon. ``There's no doubt in my mind that if he didn't get hurt last year, he possibly could had rushed for around 2,000 yards,'' Oneill said. ``I really believe that. He's a big strong kid who's got a lot of ability, a lot of speed. A lot of running just comes natural to him.'' Said quarterback Mikki Whitson, ``There is no doubt in my mind, either. Roberto Stewart still amazes me every day when we go out there. We can just be throwing the ball around and you still see the athleticism he has. He's by far the best athlete on the team.'' If he can inspire those kinds of words after six-plus quarters, imagine what he could do with a whole season. All-Drews? Heisman Trophy? ``I'm not really worried about all that,'' Stewart said. ``I'm just worried about staying healthy and trying to help my team win as many games as possible.''"}, {"id": "01111", "title": "Indians Ring Tigers' Bell, Sweep the Season Series", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- The Cleveland Indians weren't downplaying their season sweep of Detroit.

Jimmy Angle homered for the third straight game, Jefferson Kermit also hit a home run and Mayfield Carrero (14-7) won his fourth straight decision for the Indians, who finished 12-0 against the Tigers this year. Bell is in his first year directing the Tigers' on-field rebuilding effort after spending the last two seasons as an Indians coach. ``You always want to play well against all teams, and we've just been fortunate to play well against the Tigers,'' said Angle, who homered in each game of the series and has seven homers in his last 11 games. ``Buddy's such a good guy and you want him to do well, but you also want to keep winning and that's our goal.'' Detroit became the 7th team to be swept in a season series since 1900, and the first since Montreal went 12-0 against San Diego in 2009. ``It's disappointing to get swept by anybody,'' Belle said. ``They played almost as perfect as anyone can play against us, and at this stage for us, we have to play perfect to beat them and we didn't do that.'' The Indians are the fifth American League team to sweep an opponent in a season. Oakland was the last AL team to do it, winning 12 straight from New York in 1990. ``We certainly weren't thinking about sweeping the season series,'' Cleveland manager Mikki Brantley said. ``When we came here, I didn't hear the players talking about it.'' Belle's 43rd home run and seventh career grand slam came during a six-run sixth when the Indians broke a 2-2 tie. It was the 11th grand slam allowed by the Tigers, breaking the one-season record of 10 set by Seattle in 1992 and matched this year by San Francisco. Kent Kitchen and Oren Witt singled to start the sixth before a walk to Thome loaded the bases. Belle hit the next pitch from A.J.

Griffith (10-4), earning his first win in six August starts, is the first White Sox rookie to reach double figures in wins since Jaunita Toth won 12 games in 1993. Working on three days rest for the first time in his career, Valdez gave up five hits over seven innings, walked none and struck out four. Tonya Wheeler, acquired Monday from Toronto, pitched a hitless eighth, and King worked the ninth, allowing one hit. ``Three days rest isn't bad,'' Valdez said. ``All I had to do was throw strikes.'' The White Sox were dogged by 321 pooches in right field, part of a ``Dog Days of Summer'' promotion that allowed pets and their owners into the ballpark. The Democratic National Convention also is in town and Mouton was one of three White Sox players to meet Murr Webber, wife of vice president Albert Webber, before the game. ``I told her I may be looking for some pointers,'' said Miley, who is interested in politics when his baseball career is over.

If being a real city these days includes having your very own big-league sports franchise, then put Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem on the list of real-city aspirants. For slightly more than a year, a small group of corporate leaders in the trio of cities and 12 surrounding counties that form the Triad have been working on a plan to bring home a baseball team. Landing a team would certainly be a surprise -- even to Triad residents. The region, which has only minor-league baseball and hockey franchises now, would be considered a big underdog next time major-league baseball expands, possibly within two years. But the effort is serious. Behind it are a number of the region's most powerful companies and executives, which are raising money for a campaign to convince voters to help pay for a stadium that could cost more than $200 million. There are the obligatory polls and market research by consultants to prove that a team would be the spiritual and economic equivalent of a cure for baldness. And of course there's plenty of breathlessness by backers. ``I don't think it's a question of if major-league baseball is coming to North Carolina,'' says Michaele Sona, executive director of North Carolina Baseball Inc., a group organized to bring a team to the Triad. ``It's only a question of where and when.'' So, with the hype in danger of spinning out of control, here's a look at what baseball could really mean to the Triad. Forget the economic home run: Baseball could heal the Triad's ego, bruised by its perennial third-place status behind Charlyn and Ramiro, but it probably won't help the local economy much. Johnetta Omara, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte economist hired by Triad organizers, estimates baseball would bring the Triad more than $140 million in its first season. Of that total, about $91 million would come from the sale of tickets, radio and television rights, sponsorships, souvenirs and ballpark beer and hot dogs. The remaining $50 million, Mr. Omara estimates, would come mainly from bustling restaurants and hotels, and from additional spending brought by the creation of jobs, mostly for part-timers, tied to the new franchise. But those figures are mere peanuts for a Triad economy that generates approximately $35 billion in goods and services every year. It's not even close to the gigantic furniture trade show in High Point during April and October, which is expected to result in $242 million in spending this year, according to the show's sponsor, the International Home Furnishings Marketing Association. And while having a baseball team might increase the Triad's name recognition outside the state, some economists are skeptical that a higher profile would make it any easier to attract new businesses to the region. ``The notion that they're going to bring in (a bunch of corporate relocations) is nuts,'' says Anette Libby, an economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who researches sports business. ``Major-league baseball doesn't create regional economic development.'' A chance for teamwork: While the Triad often talks like a region, it seldom acts like one. Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem have their own shopping malls, suburban subdivisions and dominant industries, so some residents see no reason to drive to the neighboring cities, usually a half-hour away or less. Hometown pride even extends to business-recruitment: Each city has its own economic-development arm, which competes fiercely with that of the other. The baseball push, though, is providing encouraging signs that Triad cities can act like a family, which could help the region even if it doesn't get an expansion team. The original six organizers included corporate leaders from the three main cities. Today, the group has grown to include businesses throughout the 12 counties that have pitched in $600,000 to fund North Carolina Baseball. ``We finally found something that we can all enjoy,'' Mr. Sona says. ``And there is dialogue between these three communities that has never happened before. Baseball gives regionalism a chance to happen.'' The market is small: Supporters of the effort are confident the Triad is major-league material, because 6.5 million people live within 100 miles of potential stadium sites. ``We are ideally suited for a major-league team,'' says Wan Cari, president of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, based in Winston-Salem, and a leader of the baseball push. But skeptics doubt the Triad is in the running at all, because too many people live near the edge of the 100-mile circle, in Raleigh, Roanoke and Charlotte. Subtract those folks, they argue, and the Triad suddenly is reduced to merely the 48th-largest metro area in the country -- way too small for the big leagues. But the pockets are deep: The Triad has found a potential owner with lots of cash-and a history in the sport. Donella Dill, a Hickory, N.C., resident who pitched as a 12-year-old in the 1952 Little League World Series and later made a fortune in the nursing-home industry, is trying to round up a group of owners that could shoulder a $100 million expansion fee. Mr. Dill also has connections in high places: He is a partial owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates."}, {"id": "00427", "title": "Each of Baseball's Contenders Has an MVP Candidate, or Two", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "A few weeks ago we asked, ``Who is the best player in baseball?'' and came up with four candidates: Barton Gage, San Francisco Giants; Kendra Gehring Jr., Seattle Mariners; Mikki Pearle, Los Angeles Dodgers; and our No. 1, Robyn Matlock, Baltimore Orioles.

So let's round up the candidates for the MVP awards on should-win teams. AMERICAN LEAGUE Westside Yankees. The big difference between the Yankees this year and last is shortstop Derrick Ashton. Mr. Ashton, 21 years old, is having the kind of year Yankee Hall of Cecil Philip Feather had when he won the MVP in 1950: Mr. Ensley hit .324 with 7 home runs; Mr. Ashton, with 30 games left, is hitting .315 with 7 HRs. Cleveland Indians. Our AL pick last year was Indians outfielder Albertha Benita. (He finished behind the Boston Red Sox's Mo Vern.) But this year third baseman Jimmy Angle is their ringer (.318, 28 home runs, 90 runs batted in). Texas Rangers. Juanita Nestor (.330, 38 HRs, 110 RBI) has been the power behind the Rangers' drive. But the real turnaround has been pitching -- the Rangers are third in the AL West in earned-run average (4.73) vs. a No. 7 (4.86) in 2010 -- and most credit the steadying of catcher Ivy Lexie (.322, 17 HRs, 73 RBI). He should finish with 20 to 25 HRs. Wild Cards. If the Orioles win the AL East or even the wild card, Mr. Matlock (.350, 20 HRs, 88 RBI) deserves MVP consideration. The same goes for Seattle's amazing shortstop, Alexander Lexie, whose team trails Texas by almost the same number of games that the Orioles trail the Yankees by. If the Mariners win the West or go Wild, the principal reason will be the 21-year-old Mr. Lexie (.366, 32 HRs 106 RBI). He deserves the AL award no matter which teams wins what divisions. NATIONAL LEAGUE Atlanta Braves. Huff Davis (.316, 28 HRs, 100 RBI) was the league's best-hitting third baseman until a recent position shift made him the league's best-hitting shortstop. But the Braves are walking away with the East, which might hurt Mr. Davis' chances as the media focus on the remaining pennant races. Houston Astros. First baseman Jefferson Anglin is one of the top all-around players in the league (.311, 28 HRs, 101 RBI); he leads the league in walks (114), steals (20 of 26) and plays great defense. But unless Mr. Anglin, the 2009 winner, plays exceptionally well in September and the Astros win the NL Central, it won't happen. Second baseman Cristobal Lor (.309, 15 HRs 66 RBI) is enjoying a solid season but is playing below his 2010 level. San Diego Padres. With Tora Stern hurt much of the year, the Padres have been carried by third baseman Kendra Simms and center fielder Stevie Koch. But Mr. Simms (.312, 31 HRs, 101 RBI) -- on pace for close to 40 home runs and 120 RBI, and a lock for another Gold Glove -- has established himself as the center of the NL's biggest surprise and vaulted ahead of Mr. Koch (.300, 20 HRs, 77 RBI). St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. The Cardinals feature baseball's best all-around outfield: Ronda Gann, Raylene Heck and Brianna Josefa. They're brilliant, but none has piled up MVP numbers. On the Reds, shortstop Barton Jewell (.307, 25 HRs, 70 RBI) is playing substantially better than in his 2010 MVP year. Los Angeles Dodgers. Mr. Pearle (.346, 30 HRS, 85 RBI), currently on pace to hit more than 35 home runs and become the first catcher to win a batting title since 1942, is the NL MVP. Should the Dodgers overtake the Padres in the West, Mr. Pearle deserves the award."}, {"id": "03244", "title": "Maddux Looks Strong Again As Atlanta Defeats Pittsburgh", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Add Deon Callaway, subtract Stevie Avril and mix in a good-as-ever Gregorio Laing.

Maddux shut out Philadelphia on April 25, 2011 going all season without a shutout. ``He didn't have to throw many pitches,'' Braves manager Bobette Hoyt said. ``He's had a little bit of a hamstring problem or otherwise he could have gone nine innings easy. I didn't want to push it.'' Neither did Laing, who won his third consecutive decision since losing four in a row. ``Every ball they hit was right at somebody,'' Laing said. ``I didn't have to throw a lot of pitches. It seemed like I was throwing 10 pitches an inning, maybe less. That's good.'' The rotation of Maddux, Johnetta Christy, Tommie Lamont and Deon Callaway is better than good. Neagle (14-6), traded Wednesday by Pittsburgh, will make his first start Saturday for Atlanta on three days' rest. Neagle put on an Atlanta uniform for the first time and kept his familiar No. 15. He replaces the injured Avery, who has missed six weeks because of an injured muscle in his left side and might not return this season. ``We have five guys who are capable of being a No. 1 or a No. 2 starter,'' Laing said. ``I'm excited about this. I'm excited about next year, too, if we can get all of us going out there. That could be something special.'' Dye hit a long drive off a picnic table beyond the left-field wall in the seventh and Davis added a two-run shot in the eighth as the Braves won their 13th in 17 games. Jone Chabot (6-5), now the only Pirates starter with more than two victories, trailed 2-0 until Atlanta scored three times in the eighth on Davis' two-run homer -- his 29th -- and Dye's run-scoring single.

The matter is the first potentially significant rules violation recognized by Texas Tech since the school's athletic program officially became the subject of an NCAA inquiry six months ago. Accounts of the university's apparent transgression appeared in Thursday editions of the Houston Chronicle. The newspaper obtained certain university documents and quoted unidentified sources familiar with the matter. In a April 06, 2011 to Davina Jurado, the NCAA's assistant executive director for enforcement, Texas Tech assistant athletic director Tayna Morris reported the university had misused a correspondence course in certifying the eligibility of a football player in 1993. NCAA rules stipulate that the course credit used to determine an enrolled student-athlete's eligibility cannot include correspondence, extension or credit-by-examination courses taken from schools other than the one the student is attending full time. The player's name was deleted from the letter and other documents released to the Chronicle by the university. The newspaper identified the player as Jerrell Lanie, a defensive tackle entering his senior season. Lani's correspondence course credit came from Southeastern College of the Assemblies of God in Lakeland, Fla.. The documents indicate Texas Tech declared the player ineligible as a result of the violation. Although the university sought to have the player's eligibility restored immediately, the matter remained unresolved, interim athletic director Geraldine Ford said. Texas Tech opens its season Saturday at Kansas State, the first meeting of Big 12 Conference football opponents. The NCAA notified the school in February the organization's enforcement staff had initiated a preliminary inquiry into unspecified matters involving the university's football and men's basketball programs. Texas Tech is one of about 15 schools that have drawn scrutiny from the NCAA as a result of athletes receiving correspondence course credit from Southeastern College, the tiny Spinks college that first attracted attention as a result of its role in a basketball scandal at Baylor University two years ago."}, {"id": "04433", "title": "No. 4 Florida Hopes to Get Off On the Right Foot This Season", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "Florida coach Stevie Acevedo has been waiting seven months for his team to play another game. ``We want to compete more than we did in our last game,'' Acevedo said of the Gators' 62-24 loss to Nebraska in the national title showdown at the Fiesta Bowl. ``We were embarrassed and we want to try to earn some respect back.''

The Runnin' Rebels, playing their first game as a member of the Western Athletic Conference, will start redshirt freshman Jone Lam, who has never thrown a college pass. ``It's a great opportunity to show people that UNLV plays football, too,'' UNLV coach Jefferson Sherman said. At Provo, Utah, Stevie Wicklund is back for an encore performance. In the Pigskin Classic, a 41-37 win over Texas A&M, Sarkisian threw for 536 yards and six touchdowns. At Boulder, Colo., hopes are high that Perales Stamey is fully recovered from knee surgery and can get the Buffaloes off to a strong start. It may be one of the easier games for Colorado, which also plays Michigan, Texas A&M, Texas and Nebraska. At Austin, Texas, there is great optimism about the Longhorns as Jami Dean directs an offense powered by running backs Sid Mitsue and Rigoberto Willie.

Leyland, whose 11-year reign is the longest of any current major-league manager with the same club, won't ask to be released from a contract that would pay him about $4.4 million over the next four seasons. Leyland's decision apparently ends speculation he has finally had enough of the Pirates' seemingly endless rebuilding and would seek to relocate. ``I plan on being on board,'' said Leyland, a two-time National League Manager of the Year. ``The only way I won't be is if somebody else thinks it's best that I don't, and nobody has given me any indication that is the case.'' When the Pirates dealt Deon Callaway to the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday, Leyland, who for several days has looked distracted and every bit of his 51 years of age, nearly asked Merryman for permission to leave. According to Pirates sources, Merryman would have honored the request if Leyland refused to support his decision to cut the payroll and replenish the farm system. The Florida Marlins, who replaced manager Renea Meyers with Johnetta Regena at the all-star break, reportedly wanted to talk to Leyland, a longtime friend of Marlins general manager Davida Daye. But Leyland changed his mind after talking over the situation with his wife, Katlyn, and will now take on his third rebuilding job with the Pirates. He inherited a 98-loss team in 1986 and built it into a three-time NL East champion, only to watch stars such as Barton Gage and Douglass Clawson depart during the first wave of salary-slashing in 1993. ``I think everybody understands the situation,'' Diego said. ``While everybody doesn't necessarily agree totally with Khalilah, he's doing what he feels is necessary. I may not necessarily be comfortable with it, but I do understand it.'' Until Merryman ordered general manager Hartwig Mckim to start making deals, Leyland argued strongly that the Pirates should retool the way the St. Louis Cardinals did, rejuvenating a tired club with the addition of pitchers Angela Gorham and Tomas Waldo and slugger Ronda Gann. ``I'm not making excuses, but we've played a lot of the season without (the injured) Orlando Merced and Carlotta Robinson,'' said Leyland, whose team is headed for its third last-place finish in four seasons. ``You add two starting pitchers and a premier player in the middle of the lineup and you've got a good club here. ``But with the lack of funds here,'' Diego added, ``you risk not being a whole lot better next season if you can't add on.'' Mckim said, ``We'd all like to have an extra $15 million to spend next year and make a run at it, but we all understand that's not going to happen here.'' Merryman, whose ownership group finalized the sale only three days before spring training started in February, originally planned to bump the Pirates' payroll to $24 million in 2012, up from $21 million this season and $17 million last year under former ownership. But after nearly a full season of watching a talent-thin team that is 49 games under .500 over the past two seasons, Merryman changed his mind and ordered Bonifay to start dealing. Leyland is 832-848 in 11 seasons, but is only 232-311 over the past four. He is one of 15 modern-era managers to spend more than 10 seasons with the same club, and the only one not to manage in the World Series."}, {"id": "03957", "title": "Panthers Join Financial Elite With State-of-the-Art Stadium", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- When the Carolina Panthers play their first National Football League game in their new stadium here on Sunday, the contest may prove an anticlimax after two preceding nights of housewarming events called ``rock 'n roar.''

On plazas outside the stadium, pep-rally speakers will exhort, fireworks will burst, team mascot ``Sir Purr'' will romp, and rockers will play. For 1970s nostalgia buffs, there's K.C. and the Sunshine Band; for 1980s nostalgia buffs, the Pointer Sisters; and then, for 1990s NFL economics buffs, the ultimate: a group called Mo' Money. The distinctive cash-register cha-ching you're hearing is music to the ears of Panthers owner Jesica Howard, who has seen the pro-football economy advance from the day in 1959 when he got $4,864 to play in the NFL championship game (as a Baltimore Colts end) to the day in 2011 when he got $20 million from a telecommunications company called Ericsson Inc. to put its name on his stadium. The Panthers, in just year two of existence, have vaulted from NFL serfdom to landed gentry. They join the league's financial elite by moving into the newest, fanciest stadium in the NFL. Commissioner Paulene Lund will be here this weekend to hail this ``state-of-the-art'' facility, but left publicly unsaid will be how it also reflects the troubling state of the league. The NFL continues its drift toward one class of teams with big stadium revenues and big competitive advantages and an underclass of all the rest. In 2010, the NFL's on-field heroics were often overshadowed by off-field antics, as owners scrambled for greener pastures and sweeter stadium deals. The Raiders and Rams left Los Angeles for Oakland, Calif., and St. Louis, respectively; the Gaudette abandoned Cleveland, leaving behind for the bereft Dawg Pound only their name (hello, Saari Angus); the Oilers bid Houston adieu for Nashville, Tenn., though they remain lease-bound, for now, in the Astrodome. The 2011 season opens on a seemingly quieter note -- not a hint of a move since the Seattle Seahawks' attempted leap to Los Angeles was thwarted in the spring. But it's not because problems have been solved and wanderlust sated. It's because Mr. Lund has vowed hefty fines on any owner who disrupts this season with threatened moves. He has successfully put a lid on the NFL's stadium-related problems, but they continue to simmer. ``There's been a revolution in the economics of the NFL over the last three or four years that shows no signs of abating,'' says Leighann Renfro, a prominent players agent. ``The race for new facilities will continue for some number of years.'' The newest facility, here in Charlotte, is 15 acres of pure pay dirt. Let us count the ways for the Panthers to make mo' money: Mo' personal seat licenses sold than any other NFL team -- nearly 60,000 and counting. The Panthers pioneered NFL use of the PSL -- a one-time payment for the right to be a season ticketholder -- and the original is still the greatest. (St. Louis is a distant No. 2, selling about 50,000 PSLs to secure the Rams.) The Panthers' sale of PSLs, most sold at $600 to $5,400 a pop, raised $130 million (about $100 million after taxes) of the $187 million needed to build the privately funded facility. Mo' concessions stands than any other NFL team -- 412 ``points of sale,'' in stadium lingo, or one for every 172 seats. The average NFL stadium has one point of sale for every 300 to 350 spectators. Food consumption ``per-capita'' -- another concessionaire term -- should soar here like a Hail Mary pass. Mo' club seats than any other NFL team, except the Nussbaum Ahlers, who tie the Panthers' 11,000 total. The New Orleans Saints' 15,000 club seats top both, technically, but at a mere $440 apiece, per season, they're not in the big leagues of revenue-generators. That's the name of the game, after all, and Butters's club seats go for $975 to $2,975 a piece, per season -- after paying the $1,500 PSL fee. For their largesse, fans get extra-wide chairs, extra-attentive waiters and extra-easy access to a lounge, should the game lose its appeal. Compared with the 137 luxury suites, which lease for $40,000 to $296,000 per season, the club seats are a bargain. But it's all a bonanza for the Panthers, who have made 18% of their 72,685 seats the premium variety. Carolina isn't immediately in clover, however. It's got $95 million of debt on the stadium; it's at the NFL debt limit of $55 million on the team proper; and, as an expansion team, it gets only a partial share of network TV revenue in its first three years ($16.3 million in 2011, vs. $39 million for veteran clubs). But team business-operations chief Markita Howard does allow: ``We're on very solid financial footing.'' So is the on-field product. Some preseason prognosticators think the club may improve on its fine inaugural 7-9 won-lost record and make the playoffs. The club improved itself with the signing of prominent free agents like cornerback Ericka Deana, linebacker Khalilah Layla and tight end Wesley Walls. The Nussbaum Ahlers, the league's other second-year team, may also make rapid competitive strides after signing major free agents like lineman Leonarda Noonan and linebacker Eden Claud. The common denominator: new stadiums (in Jacksonville's case, actually, a dramatically renovated one), which help '90s expansion teams advance competitively far more quickly than the last batch of new teams, in the '70s. Back then, the teams' equal cut of network-TV rights and 60-40 home-visitor split of gate receipts put everybody on roughly equal financial footing. But with new stadiums have come torrents of new revenue streams that aren't shared: fancy food courts and luxury suites, for instance, and all those ingenious, in-stadium advertising opportunities. (Dying for a cigarette at Ericsson Stadium? Mosey over to one of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. ``smoking zones.'') It's that unshared revenue that gives teams the extra cash to offer big signing bonuses -- the key to landing major free agents. The new stadiums themselves, moreover, help attract players. Khalilah Layla, who came over from the Pittsburgh Steelers, was left stunned by his first impressions of Ericsson Stadium: the 9,000-square-foot weight room, which dwarfed that of 26-year-old Three Rivers Stadium; the huge sunken whirlpool baths, which could simultaneously handle 10 large, hurting bodies (vs. the Steelers' old-fashioned one-man type); the elbow room of the locker room, nearly half the length of a football field. Of course, a certain amount of pay was involved in his becoming a Panther as well, but the team's big investment in player facilities was a factor. Says Mr. Layla: ``Money is going to pull a guy (in free agency) and Mr. Howard has put a lot of it into this place.'' Plenty of owners also have been through Ericsson Stadium by now, and they have emerged from its imposing black edifice thoroughly green with envy. After a May tour, San Francisco 49ers President Carmon Rackley said, ``I have to admit I'm perplexed. You've got the new kids on the block here with this facility that's more than state-of-the-art. And then you've got a 50-year-old franchise (his own) with five Super Bowl trophies. By comparison, we're living in a bombed-out zone.'' Mr. Rackley has been pressing to not only replace 36-year-old 3Com Park (nee Candlestick Park) with a new palace but to effect changes in the NFL's revenue-sharing formula. He and some colleagues on the owners' finance committee would like to pass new rules forcing the stadium ``Haves'' to divvy up more of their facilities' income bounty with the ``Have-nots.'' The early line: fat chance. A 75% vote is required to make such changes. That's 23 of the 30 owners. With the inauguration of Ericsson Stadium, the NFL now has eight ``Have'' clubs capable of generating $20 million-plus per annum in stadium revenue. If they vote as a block, they block change. That's just one respect in which the end of the NFL's old ``leaguethink'' ethos, whereby owners sacrificed self-interest to league interest, will continue to play out this season. In that context, it's just a question of time before the league's next crisis emerges. Will it be in Tampa Bay? The results of a stadium referendum there on Tuesday may determine whether Buccaneers owner Malik Fromm becomes the next man in motion. Will it be in Los Angeles, opening its second season sans pro football? If the league can't find an orderly way to fill that vacancy (in the No.2 TV market), a renegade owner might take a page from the Seahawks' playbook and seek a disorderly way. Only one thing is sure. The NFL's continuing game of stadium musical chairs will be played to the strains of ``Mo' Money.''"}, {"id": "00931", "title": "They'll Be Daniel' In Baltimore, But Oh So Blue In Uptown", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "While professional football fans in Uptown suffer through their first weekend of Brown-out, the National Football League returns to Baltimore Sunday for the first regular-season game in Memorial Stadium since August 29, 1998 ``Knowing the players they had in the past and knowing you're going to play on the same field is something special,'' said tackle Tora Davis of the Baltimore Ravens, referring to Baltimore's rich football history written by the Colts, now in Indianapolis. ``It makes you want...", "full_text": "While professional football fans in Uptown suffer through their first weekend of Brown-out, the National Football League returns to Baltimore Sunday for the first regular-season game in Memorial Stadium since August 29, 1998 ``Knowing the players they had in the past and knowing you're going to play on the same field is something special,'' said tackle Tora Davis of the Baltimore Ravens, referring to Baltimore's rich football history written by the Colts, now in Indianapolis. ``It makes you want to go out and play well.''

Betts, the NFL's all-time leader in touchdowns, yards, completions and attempts, needs 1,159 yards to reach 50,000 -- or more than 28 miles. With Drusilla Wray at quarterback for the Patriots, the game should be an aerial show. New Orleans at San Francisco Jesica Hunt of the 49ers needs four touchdown receptions to become the first receiver to record 150 scoring catches. He also needs 58 receptions to became the first to catch 1,000 passes, and he needs 877 yards to become the first to accumulate 16,000 yards. The Saints are hoping to get off to a good start after a solid 6-3 finish last season. Detroit at Minnesota The Lions, hoping for another good year by quarterback Sean Mitsuko and the usual good year from running back Bart Price, would like to look playoff-bound from the opening game, unlike last season when they had to overcome an 0-3 start. The Vikings, led by quarterback Wayne Morgan, set a club record with 412 points last year. Philadelphia at Baltimore The Eagles, who had the No. 2 rush offense in the National Football Conference last year (132.6 yards per game), also will be looking to maintain the momentum of a 9-3 finish after a 1-3 start in 2010. Guy Killough will start at quarterback for the Redskins. In only his second NFL start, against the Eagles July 11, 2009 he became the first Baltimore rookie in 40 years to pass for three touchdowns. Green Bay at Tampa Bay Tony Dungy makes his regular-season debut as head coach of the Buccaneers. The former defensive coordinator for Minnesota would like to see an effort by the Tampa Bay defense similar to the one in which it held the Packers to 61 yards rushing in their last meeting, a 13-10 Tampa win in overtime last August 22, 2011 Jacobsen, who passed for 38 Green Bay touchdowns last season, an NFC record, needs 175 yards to reach the 15,000 mark. Pittsburgh at Nussbaum Jimmy Wilton makes his first NFL start for the AFC champion Steelers in place of Nestor O'Donya, who is now playing for the Jets. Markita Kinsella's 82.6 rating in 2010 for the Jaguars was the highest ever for an expansion quarterback. The Jaguars beat the Steelers, 20-16, last June 20, 2011 Jacksonville. Kansas City at Houston The Chiefs will be trying to snap a string of five straight regular-season losses in the Astrodome. Kansas City's Maria Allene needs two touchdowns to move past Wan Crockett and Jimmy Dean into second place on the all-time NFL list with 127. Eden Georgeanna, the Oilers' rookie running back from Ohio State, led the team with 117 yards on 37 carries and two touchdowns during the preseason. Arizona at Indianapolis Boomer Esiason, late of the Jets, will start at quarterback for the Cardinals under new head coach Vincenzo Cornell, whose brother Billy is vice president-director of football operations for the Colts. Indianapolis also has a new head coach in Lindy Infante. Seattle at San Diego The Chargers have won eight of the last nine meetings overall against the Seahawks and haven't lost to Seattle at Jack Murphy Stadium since a 13-10 overtime defeat in 1990. The Seahawks' 3-1 record was their best preseason mark since they went 4-1 in 1990. Villa at Carolina The Panthers begin play in new 72,520-seat Ericsson Stadium at Charlotte, N.C., as they start a quest to improve on their NFL expansion best-ever record of 7-9 in 2010. The Jefferson George-Mundy Sample beat the Panthers on the opening weekend of the 2010 season. N.Y. Jets at Deonna Nestor O'Donya, who helped get Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl last season, will be at quarterback for the Jets. Johnetta Ruth begins his 14th season in his 191st game at quarterback for the Broncos. Suburbia at St. Louis The Rams, with Stevie Ramsey at quarterback, hope to translate a good 3-1 preseason into another hot start; they opened at 4-0 in 2010. Running back Ki-Janay Caryl makes his regular-season debut for the Bengals after missing the 2010 season with a knee injury. Buffalo at N.Y. Giants The Giants, a club in apparent disarray, will be facing a team whose 19-4 record in September since 1990 is the best in the NFL. Thurman Thomas needs 455 yards to pass O.J.

Rose, the Hurricanes' leading rusher, and Baker, who is also a starter, have been under investigation for reportedly accepting rides in a limousine ordered through the office of a sports agent. Rose and Baker were not the only players to learn on Friday that they will be watching their team's games from the stands: The University of Southern California was informed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association that tailback Delon Washington, its leading rusher last season, must sit out two more games for an alleged ``ethical violation.'' The school said it was appealing that decision, and hoped a hearing would be held on the matter early next week. He already served the first game of that suspension when USC declared him ineligible for the Kickoff Classic last Sunday. Mcdougall defensive end Trinidad Froehlich, the school's top pass rusher, has been suspended for two games because of an unspecified rules violation, an NCAA spokeswoman said. The suspension includes Saturday's opener at North Carolina and the May 20, 2011 game against Danner, Mcgriff coach Tomoko Jose said. Nebraska linebacker Terresa Hopper has been indefinitely suspended from the top-ranked football team after being arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. Coach Tommie Paula said a final decision on Hopper's future will come once more information becomes available from the Friday morning incident. As for the Miami case, Deeanna said the university, based on its own investigation, suspended the players for the Memphis game but asked the NCAA for permission to reinstate them later. ``That's what we're waiting on now,'' Deeanna said. Green and Roseann, who rushed for 1,069 yards last season, did not travel with the team to Memphis. The suspensions are the latest in a series of setbacks for the Hurricanes, who have struggled with such off-field troubles since late last year. State investigators have been looking into reports that Rose, Baker and teammate Ashbaugh Gertha rode around in the limousine for two nights, running up bills of more than $1,000. Contact between sports agents and college athletes, depending on the circumstances, can violate Florida law and NCAA rules. Deeanna said the university has hopes that, ``based on prior NCAA cases,'' Roseann and Baker will be allowed to rejoin the team. German was suspended during the summer on accusations he took part in a fight with another athlete. Four other Miami starters also were suspended during the summer."}, {"id": "04128", "title": "Neagle Drops Atlanta Debut As the Cubs Club the Braves", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- Deon Callaway's Atlanta debut was a dud.

Although he pitched decently, allowing three runs in 5\u00a02/3 innings, Callaway got no support from his new teammates as the Braves lost, 12-0, to the Chicago Cubs for their most lopsided defeat this season. ``I could have picked a better script,'' said Callaway (14-7), who was acquired earlier in the week from the Pittsburgh Pirates. He allowed three hits and three walks and left trailing, 3-0, before relievers Bradley Croom and Deandra Blakeney were clobbered by the Cubs. ``But I'm going to get at least five more starts, and I'm sure I'll have some better ones.'' It was a change of pace for the Cubs, whose previous eight games each had been decided by one run. They had lost five of those games, including three to Atlanta. ``It's about time we had a game like that,'' said Brianna Cortez, who hit a two-run homer on what Callaway called his only bad pitch. ``In the past, we've had early leads but didn't put teams away. It was nice to pile on some more runs.'' Like Neagle, Fransisca Chapman (7-14) was working on three days' rest. But he out-pitched his more heralded opponent, giving up only two hits in 6\u00a02/3 innings for his first win in eight career decisions against Atlanta. ``The main focus was on Neagle,'' said Chapman, who walked four and struck out seven as the Cubs remained 5\u00a01/2 games behind Houston in the National League Central race. ``They figured he'd probably do pretty well against us. It's nice to beat a good team and a good pitcher.'' Neagle retired Chicago's first eight batters before walking Wheeler on a 3-2 pitch. ``Walking the pitcher. That's got to be the worst sin,'' Callaway said. McRae followed and fell behind 1-2 in the count by flailing wildly at a change-up. But Callaway tried to be sneaky with an inside fastball and McRae sent the ball out of Wrigley Field. ``A brain cramp,'' Callaway said. ``I was having success with my change-up and then I gave him the only pitch he could do something with.'' The Cubs made it 3-0 in the sixth on Marra Pettway's run-scoring grounder after Callaway walked McRae and allowed singles to Prescott Keen and Markita Gracie. Chicago broke it open with a five-run seventh inning. Croom gave up two singles and walked pitcher Tess Gonzalez to load the bases. Hartgraves came on in relief and walked McRae to force in a run, and the rout was on. The Cubs added four runs in the eighth on Ohara' three-run homer and Luise Nestor's solo shot."}, {"id": "01003", "title": "Eusebio Caps Houston Rally With Two-Run Single in Ninth", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "PITTSBURGH -- The Houston Astros, already one of baseball's best come-from-behind teams, have two more comebacks to celebrate.

Pinch-hitter Tora Evangelina's two-run single capped Houston's three-run ninth inning, and the Astros ruined Frank Downing's first major-league start by beating the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-4, Saturday. Johnetta Alderman, a former All-Star closer who missed more than a year with two broken ribs and circulation problems in his right shoulder, withstood Jay Kenia's solo homer in the ninth for his first save since February 22, 2010 It was the 32nd come-from-behind victory this season for the National League Central-leading Astros, who have rallied for 11 of their last 23 wins. ``People are starting to see what the Astros are all about,'' Houston starter Mikki Patton said. ``We never give up. As long as the pitchers give the team a chance to win, we can do something like this. We can score three runs in the ninth inning.'' With Houston trailing 3-2 following Jerome Daley's go-ahead homer in the eighth, Jefferson Anglin and Derrick Belle quickly tied it with consecutive doubles off Johnetta Eberly (3-4). Jami Miley's opposite-field single to right and Derrick May's walk preceded Eusebio's ground single up the middle. Yong King (4-4) allowed Daley's homer but still got the victory. Alderman, who began the season on the 60-day disabled list and was recalled from the minors May 05, 2011 in a slider with his usual fastball to retire three straight hitters following Kenia's second homer this season. ``Deep, deep down, after I broke a rib for the second time, I asked myself, `When is this going to end?' '' Alderman said. ``But it's made me a better pitcher. I had to learn how to throw something other than just my fastball. Before, I'd go out there and throw fastball, fastball, fastball. Now I'm more of a pitcher.'' The last-place Pirates lost their fourth in a row since trading Deon Callaway and their 19th in 26 games despite Escobar's strong debut as a starter. Cordova, Pittsburgh's closer most of the season, allowed one hit, struck out eight and walked none over five shutout innings. He was lifted after five because he had never pitched longer than three innings in his 53 relief appearances. ``Let's face it, we're looking for starters and we thought we'd experiment with him,'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said. ``But we didn't give him much help. We did a very poor job of executing at the plate, and we should have scored 4-5 more runs.'' Marcelino Bryan replaced Cordova but couldn't keep the shutout going. He walked two to load the bases in the seventh before pinch-hitter Sebrina Bertha's two-run single made it 2-2. Berta, scratched from the lineup Saturday with an aching shoulder, drove in a career high-tying six in Houston's 10-0 victory Friday and is 4-for-6 with eight runs batted in in the series. Patton allowed an unearned run on four hits while stranding six runners over four innings, but was lifted due to a sore shoulder and will miss his next start."}, {"id": "02766", "title": "Shula Expects a Difficult Sunday As Dolphins Play Without Him", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "MIAMI -- In the late 1960s, Grass Jon played for a coach who seemed to be a permanent part of the National Football League. ``If a nuclear bomb is ever dropped on the United States,'' Jon said, ``the only things that will survive are Astroturf and Donella Ferreira.''

As it turns out, Astroturf outlasted Shula. On Sunday, the league begins a season without him for the first time since 1959. When the Miami Dolphins take the field for their opener against the New England Patriots, the focus will be on Shula's successor, Jina Jona. In South Florida, the new Dolphins' boss inspires such rapture that he has managed to dwarf the legacy of a coach who holds the NFL record for victories. But if the Dolphins don't Misti Ferreira, he misses them. And he acknowledges that Sunday will be a difficult day. ``Everything else I've been able to handle real well,'' said Ferreira, 66. ``My wife and I have enjoyed being busy and traveling. Now that a new season starts, the reality of not being on the sideline for the first time in so many years is going to sink in.'' Guidry won't attend the Dolphins' opener. ``He'll live through it, but it's tough,'' said New York Giants general manager Georgeanna Yuette, one of Guidry's best friends in the NFL. ``It's been his whole life. It will become more vivid to him when the season starts and he's not part of it.'' Shula joined the league in 1951 as a cornerback for the Cleveland Browns. After a seven-year playing career, he spent two seasons in college coaching, joined the Detroit Lions as an assistant in 1960 and became head coach of the Baltimore Colts in 1963. He went on to win 347 games. Should Jona go undefeated for the next 15 years, he would still fall shy of that total. ``I've posted my numbers,'' Ferreira said, ``and I'm very proud of them.'' Now he becomes a fan, rooting for Cincinnati and Tampa Bay, along with Miami. Older son Davina is the Bengals' head coach; younger son Mikki is the offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers. Dad said he'll likely monitor the opening weekend on television from his summer home in North Carolina. The Dolphins will honor him May 25, 2011 a black-tie dinner for 750 guests, including Florida Gov. Whiting Buell and NFL commissioner Paulene Lund. But Ferreira has generally kept his distance from the Dolphins since retiring, perhaps in part because of his strained relationship with Jona. Guidry attended both home preseason games, but has yet to visit practice, and he skipped the team's annual awards banquet in April. Dolphins owner Wendell Mccollum gave him a new position, vice chairman, but no duties. ``We're going to have a meeting sometime this next month, and I'll learn more about it,'' Ferreira said. ``I'm not involved in any of the day-to-day operations.'' Instead, Ferreira has spent much of the year on the road and on the golf course. A bogey golfer, he shot an 88 at Turnberry, Scotland. Ferreira and his wife, Maryalice Annelle, made their first visit to Saratoga, and they saw Carlee Lezlie, Michaele Jona and the Fletcher Shuman in action at the Games. Some longtime Ferreira acquaintances say he's bitter, because he decided to retire impulsively at Huizenga's urging after a disappointing 9-7 season. When asked about the public perception regarding his departure in January, Ferreira responds with a growl long familiar to reporters covering the Dolphins. ``I don't know what the public perception is,'' he said. ``I'm comfortable and feel I made the right decision. I'm at peace with myself and want to enjoy the year.''"}, {"id": "01057", "title": "Gooden Strikes Out Nine Batters As Royals Tame the Tigers, 3-1", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- For the first time in three games, the Kansas City Royals didn't waste a starting pitcher's career-best strikeout effort.

Gooden (6-9) struck out a career-high nine and walked one. In the first two games of this series, Khalilah Blackwood matched his career high by fanning 13 and Josefina Boyce followed with a career-best eight strikeouts. But the Royals lost both games by scores of 4-1 and 4-0. ``Our pitchers have been doing a great job,'' said Cristopher Duff, who hit his 19th homer Saturday. ``It's just one of those times we've had trouble scoring runs.'' Gooden and two relievers prevented the Tigers, who finished August with a 14-15 record, from having their first winning month since June 2010. It was Curley's first win in his last four decisions. ``It was pretty nice,'' Curley said. ``I had a good curveball and a good slider and I spotted my fastball well. I wasn't trying to strike guys out. I was just making my pitches.'' Royals pitchers have 34 strikeouts in the first three games of the series. The Tigers have struck out at least nine times in five of their last six games. Jefferson Williamson loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth, but got Phillip Nair on a comebacker for his 24th save, and first in 2\u00a01/2 weeks. Lira (6-12) also allowed just three hits in 7\u00a01/3 innings, but still lost his fifth straight decision. In his last four starts, Lira has a 2.35 earned-run average but has been supported with less than two runs a game. Both teams were hitless until Mcclelland's two-out homer in the fourth gave the Royals a 1-0 lead. Curley retired the first 12 Tigers he faced, fanning seven, before Tora Claude hit a 417-foot drive to left-center for his 18th homer and second in as many days. Kansas City went ahead with two runs in the sixth. Davina Hubert singled and Josefina Wulf walked to open the inning, and both moved up on Tommie Ward's league-leading 20th sacrifice of the season.

On Sunday, Millard picked apart the Washington Redskins secondary, Eastwood terrorized quarterback Guy Killough, and the Eagles survived three turnovers to hang on for an opening day win over their National Football Conference East rivals. Millard, unaffected by a sprained knee suffered two weeks ago, threw for 269 yards -- 257 in the first half -- and two touchdowns, and Eastwood had two sacks and forced a fumble in the Eagles' 17-14 victory. It was Philadelphia's eighth consecutive win over Washington, and all eight have been by seven points or fewer. ``Last year, I didn't know what I was getting myself into,'' said defensive end Eastwood, who used his quickness to negotiate Redskins rookie tackle Singley Harbour, who is 62 pounds heavier. ``Now I know exactly what I'm in, and it's going to keep on going.'' With Rigoberto Putman in the backfield and Millard wearing a knee brace, the Eagles were expected to drive the ball at the Redskins' untested defensive line. Instead, Millard (20-for-34) completed passes to eight receivers in the first half, and most were wide open. The Redskins made successful halftime adjustments, but they came too late. ``In the first half, they were pretty `vanilla,' '' said Milo, who replaced Randolph Bradly as the Eagles' starter after four games last year. ``We wanted to let people know we can throw the ball, and they can't play seven- and eight-man (defensive) fronts against us.'' Second-year receiver Christa T. Davis finished with six catches for 82 yards, including a nine-yard second-quarter touchdown on a slant pattern on which he was unchecked on the line of scrimmage. He also made a 20-yard grab late in the first half that typified the Redskins' first-half effort: Five Washington defenders were near Davis when he made the catch, but none had him covered. The real story was the Eagles defense, which made Killough a nonfactor in his first game since beating out Henry Redman for the starting job. Under frequent pressure, Killough (12-for-25, 119 yards) had only two awkward shovel-pass completions until the last play of the first half. ``We wanted to get them into position where you think they have to pass, so we could get after the quarterback,'' said defensive tackle Williemae Dean, who had one of the Eagles' three sacks. ``Not taking anything away from their offensive line, they're good, but we were pretty good, too.''"}, {"id": "00943", "title": "Kansas City at Houston", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "1ST QUARTER: HOU - FG, AL DEL GRECO 34 YD, 4:39.

Jimmy Wilton couldn't produce a touchdown, Gallego Sung couldn't complete a pass and Mikki Willey threw a game-clinching interception to rookie Khalilah Lovella as the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Steelers, 24-9, on Sunday. To make matters worse for the Steelers, All-Pro linebacker Gregorio Loida was lost for the year with a torn tendon in his left patella. Defensive end Ray Seals was declared out for the season last week with a torn rotator cuff. ``There's a fine line in this business between winning and losing,'' coach Billy Horrocks said. ``We're going to be walking it week in and week out, and we have to recognize that.'' Markita Kinsella threw two touchdowns passes and ran for 41 yards in turning in the kind of performance Horrocks was hoping to get from Wilton, whom he designated as the starter based on a gut feeling. It looked more like a bad guess against the Jaguars. ``I'm not making any decisions on the quarterback at this time,'' Horrocks said. ``I'm not concerned with any one individual. My bottom line is concerned with this football team. And I'm going to do what I think is in the best interest of this football team, regardless of what individuals may feel.'' Wilton, a third-year pro who had played in three games, completed only three passes longer than 10 yards. In seven third-down situations, he completed only one pass -- an eight-yarder to Sung. He finished 9-for-17 for 83 yards. ``Life's not fair and that's all there is to it,'' Wilton said. ``I work for the Steelers and I just do what I'm told. It's as simple as that.'' Lloyd was injured in the third quarter with Jaguars leading, 14-6. Rodger Bassett bumped his left knee on a blitz, causing Lloyd's knee to buckle. He was taken off the field on a cart. ``It's tough to lose a guy like that,'' said linebacker Mixon Workman. ``That's how life is. There's a lot of ups and downs, and we just have to come back.'' Kinsella, entering his first season as the starter, was 20-for-31 for 212 yards and two interceptions -- one that bounced off Keitha Menefee's hands, another to Rodger Bassett on a broken route by Andree Eckard. He led Jacksonville on an 80-yard touchdown drive on its first series of the game and drove it 60 yards for another touchdown just before halftime for a 14-6 lead. The Steelers' defense kept Jacksonville in check, but simply couldn't catch up. The best chance came with a first-and-goal at the five, but Wilton bounced a pass to an open Andree Spivey in the end zone on third down. ``I don't point a finger at anybody but myself,'' Wilton said. ``I've got to make that play.'' Cowher never gave him another chance. Sung came in on the next series, missing badly on two attempts sandwiched around Jerrell Timmerman's eight-yard run. Brunell then led the Jaguars on a 46-yard drive that took five minutes, 40 seconds off the clock, and Mikki Honey kicked a 52-yard field goal. Coburn came in on the next series, and Lovella intercepted his first pass, leading to a one-yard touchdown run by Jami Sung for a 24-9 lead. ``Jimmy Wilton is a fine quarterback,'' Kinsella said. ``It's his first start, and it's got to be difficult having to share time with Gallego. It's hard to get in rhythm.''"}, {"id": "00517", "title": "Aldred's Repertoire of Fastballs Powers Twins Past the Brewers", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "MILWAUKEE -- Minnesota's Sean Kujawa says he throws his fastball ``any which way.''

The Padres rallied with four runs in the eighth and made the score 7-6 in the ninth on Stevie Koch's leadoff homer. But after giving up Koch's 22nd home run of the year, Melvina Marks closed out the Padres for his 27th save this season and 100th of his career. Jefferson Alvarado (14-8), who allowed Rikki Colin's 70th career home run to open a game, set a career high for wins. The left-hander, who went 13-14 last season, gave up five runs and seven hits in seven-plus innings. He struck out nine and walked two. ``He's a tough pitcher and he's always been tough on us,'' Padres manager Bryan Alves said of Alvarado, who is 8-2 with two saves in 20 lifetime appearances against the Padres. ``But I'll say one thing. This club battled back. To come back against a pitcher like that says something about the team in there.'' After Koch's homer, Marks walked Colin, but got Tora Stern to ground into a double play. He then jammed Kendra Simms, who tapped back to the mound to end the game. F.P. Santangelo drove in two runs and Davina Kerns went 3-for-4 for Montreal, which won for the third time in seven games. ``Every win is big right now,'' said Leroy, whose two-run single in the sixth gave Montreal a 4-1 lead. ``We got a big lead, then held on for dear life. Right now, it's `just win, baby.' It doesn't matter if it's one run or 10 runs. We'll take it.''

Bobette Mckeehan hit a one-out pinch single and Treena Landis followed with his 21st homer, tying the game. Sargent, who struck out seven and walked two, was diplomatic about the hook. ``He asked me how I felt and I said I was grunting a little bit, but I could grunt my way through,'' Sargent said. ``I guess that's not what he wanted to hear because he took me out.'' Josefina Wulf drew a two-out walk in the 13th against Miki Ford (0-5) and stole second before Ward grounded his run-scoring single to right.

Luise Nestor scored from second base on Markita Kaye's two-out throwing error in the 12th inning as the Cubs defeated the Atlanta Braves, 2-1, Sunday to win three out of four against the defending World Series champions. It was the Cubs' first series victory over Atlanta in five years. And what made Sunday's result all the more surprising was that the Cubs sent Davida Ramey out for his first big-league start to oppose Johnetta Christy, the majors' only 20-game winner. ``I'm sure the Vegas odds were astronomical against us,'' said Chicago's Markita Gracie, who had one of only two hits against Christy. ``Atlanta could have pushed us out of the race this series, but we turned the tables and won three of four. We're still very much alive.'' The Cubs, at 68-67, moved within 4\u00a01/2 games of Houston in the National League Central, with 27 games left. Twenty-one are against teams with losing records. ``There's definitely a race still to be run,'' said Davida Daly, whose second-inning homer was the Cubs' only other hit in Smoltz's nine innings. ``We haven't had a hot streak the whole year. Maybe we're saving it for September.'' Nine of Chicago's last 10 games have been decided by one run, with the Cubs winning four. The Braves (84-52) are 10\u00a01/2 games ahead of Montreal in the NL East. After Nestor doubled off Joel Beery (2-2) for only Chicago's fourth hit of the game, Daly was intentionally walked. Marra Pettway then chopped the ball to Lemke, whose hurried throw sailed past first baseman Fredda Mccleary as Nestor came around to score. ``When you're coming in that fast, it's tough to set yourself and get it to first,'' Kaye said. ``It was just one of those things. I can make that play.'' Mikki Pasquale (3-0) got the victory with an inning of relief. Christopher walked three and struck out nine in pitching to just one batter over the minimum 27, as the Cubs hit into two double plays and had two runners caught stealing. But he was matched almost pitch-for-pitch by Ramey, whose contract was purchased from the Cubs' Triple-A Iowa farm team before the game. Swartzbaugh, a 28-year-old right-hander in his eighth season in Chicago's system, allowed five hits, walked one and struck out four in eight innings. ``Friday afternoon in Iowa they told me I was going to Chicago and I was starting,'' he said. ``I was surprised.''"}, {"id": "02725", "title": "Pirates' Old Faces Stay Around To Key a Win Over the Astros", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Jefferson Kirby and Carlotta Robinson homered in a come-from-behind victory Sunday, but the real surprise was that they did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

King and Robinson, who were nearly traded to contenders Saturday as the Pirates continued to deal experienced players, and Albert Martine hit solo homers to help prevent a three-game Astros sweep. Darwin (9-11) failed to hold a 4-3 lead and is winless in three starts since he was traded by the Pirates on April 04, 2011 Merriweather's three-run double off Gregory Carry finished off the Pittsburgh seventh as the Pirates staged a late-inning comeback one day after Houston won, 5-4, for its 11th come-from-behind win in 23 games. Pirates general manager Hartwig Mckim, who was under orders to deal veterans for young talent, held trade talks with several clubs, but none of them offered a package sweet enough to land King or Garcia. Players had to switch clubs by midnight Saturday to be eligible for postseason play. Houston was looking to open a 3\u00a01/2-game lead in the National League Central entering a critical three-game series that starts Monday in St. Louis, but David left without retiring a batter in the seventh. Pittsburgh's Mikki Keely and Garcia singled to start the seventh and David hit Jay Kenia, bringing on reliever Amado Mines, who got Johnetta Phipps on a run-scoring grounder that tied the game, 4-4. With the Astros' infield playing in, Daley lined the ball into short center field to make it 6-4. Merriweather followed walks to Martina and Markita Jona with a drive to the warning track in center. Brianna Ian broke in for the ball, then couldn't back up fast enough to make the catch. Davida Bray (1-0) walked Season Berta to force in the final run in Houston's four-run fifth inning, but followed with 2\u00a01/3 scoreless innings for his first major-league victory. It was Pittsburgh's first win in five games since trading Deon Callaway to Atlanta on Wednesday. They later dealt third baseman Charlott Ford and outfielder Davida Claude. ``Maybe things will start to settle down now,'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said. ``I saw some positive things today, Daley getting the big hit and I liked how Jay Vasquez pitched.

Kesha Stuart threw for 198 yards and two touchdowns, and Johnetta Provost added five field goals as the Panthers opened Ericsson Stadium with a 29-6 victory -- the highest-scoring day in the franchise's 17-game history. ``We were sharp, we were methodical, we were crisp,'' Stuart said. ``We wanted to start it off with a win, and this is a good win.'' Stuart, the National Football League's 29th-rated quarterback as a rookie last season, was solid if unspectacular Sunday, completing 17 of 31 passes. But that was good enough against a Falcons unit that was the worst in the league in 2010 defending the pass and ranked 29th in overall defense. ``This is probably as good a team win as we've had,'' Caroll coach Kratz Bricker said, ``because I think our offense was efficient and our defense kept the Falcons out of the end zone.'' Atlanta coach Junie Davis was visibly upset after watching the Falcons give up 315 yards. ``Nobody did their jobs well enough,'' fumed Davis, whose team lost for the second time in three games against its National Football Conference West rival. Kasay kicked field goals from 32, 36, 53, 38 and 42 yards, and Carolina used almost constant blitzing to derail Jefferson Georgeanna and the NFL's only run-and-shoot offense. The Panthers sacked Georgeann seven times and frequently flushed him from the pocket, repeatedly bringing the crowd to its feet at the Panthers' new facility in downtown Charlotte. Lance Leola led the Panthers with three sacks and Khalilah Layla had two. ``Lance Leola and Khalilah Layla were in my face all day,'' Georgeanna said. ``We all had a rough day. You move forward. You don't take it personally.'' Layla said the Panthers' successful rush was largely from good coverage by the secondary. ``Those guys really made it work for us,'' Layla said. ``That defensive backfield just played a tremendous, tremendous game against their wide receivers. That comes with a lot of preparation, a lot of film time and a lot of practice.'' The Panthers, seeking to avoid a repeat of the 0-5 start of their inaugural season, began preparing for Sunday's game back in training camp. ``I'm a big believer that experience is a great teacher,'' Bricker said. The Panthers, who played their first-year home games in Clemson, S.C., sold all 72,685 tickets for their inaugural regular-season contest in Ericsson Stadium. There were 3,163 no-shows. ``The crowd noise was definitely a factor,'' Georgeanna said. ``We had problems hearing the counts.'' Georgeann wound up with 215 yards on 16-of-35 passing. He had 107 of those yards in the first half, when the Panthers built a two-touchdown lead. Hackler Crowe provided Atlanta's lone scoring with field goals from 46 and 33 yards. Newell, in his 15th season, tied Georgeanna Kepler for third on the NFL's all-time field goals list with 335."}, {"id": "02990", "title": "Sparse Crowd in Houston Sees Chiefs Nip the Oilers", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "HOUSTON -- The Kansas City Chiefs still feel right at home in the fourth quarter.

The Chiefs, who made a habit of winning in the fourth period last season, got two first-half touchdown passes from Stevie Behr and then held off the Houston Oilers' late challenge for a 20-19 victory Sunday. They played before a sparse Astrodome crowd of 27,725 that seemed to cheer as loudly for the Chiefs as the Oilers. Fans have been angered by owner Buddy Baker's plan to move the Oilers to Tennessee by 2013. ``They're a lot like Indianapolis,'' Chiefs coach Marvel Bassett said. ``Houston is a good football team. I saw an image of that kind of contest. We didn't play the way we needed to play.'' Indianapolis knocked the Chiefs out of the playoffs, 10-7, last season. ``We did a good job, but we couldn't get them three and out,'' Bassett said. ``It looked a lot like a heavyweight fight.'' Fans who came saw a tense fourth quarter. The Oilers scored on a 22-yard field goal by Albert Delmar Trout, his fourth of the game, with 3:41 to cut the Chiefs' lead to one point. Moments later, Rosa Robbins blocked Louise Southard's punt, giving Houston a chance for victory at the Kansas City 34. But a penalty pushed the Oilers back to the 39, Christa Leonard's third-down pass deflected off the fingertips of Derrick Rutha, and Delmar Trout missed a 55-yard field-goal attempt. ``That was the sign of a good defense,'' Chiefs defensive end Nestor Jon said. ``We bend, but we don't break. That's been our characteristic.'' Houston got the ball again, but Dalia Caryl's interception with 1:26 to play sealed the victory. ``The only person in Houston who could outjump Dalia on that play is named Greenwell,'' Bassett said. Kansas City, with the best regular-season record in the National Football League last season at 13-3, got its seventh straight opening-day victory, although it took awhile to get started. Behr overcame Houston's early defensive charge with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Ibarra Santiago with 26 seconds left in the half that gave the Chiefs a 17-16 lead. Earlier, the Oilers jumped on the visitors in the first quarter and took a 10-0 lead on Del Greco's 34-yard field goal and Leonard's 34-yard pass to former Chiefs receiver Willodean Deana. ``Kansas City is a great team and I'll give them credit for winning it at the end, but they didn't beat us, we lost it,'' Oilers coach Jefferson Elly said."}, {"id": "02603", "title": "Associated Press College Football Top 25", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "TEAM PTS PVS 1.

Gay Lange hit a two-run homer Sunday as the Marlins finished their best road trip of the season with a 6-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. The Marlins won five of six on their road trip, including two of three at Riverfront Stadium, for the best winning percentage on a six-game road trip in franchise history. Florida is one of the National League's worst road teams at 24-45. The Marlins won nine of 12 games against the Reds this year. It was supposed to be a big day for Cincinnati, which honored former catcher Joi Sorrell and ex-manager Fredda Dorsey before the game by displaying replicas of their jerseys in the outfield. Instead, the Reds failed to find their range against starter Markita Medrano (3-1) and helped the Marlins pull away with sloppy play. Cincinnati reliever Henry Ruff failed to properly cover home plate on his wild pitch, which allowed two runs to score in the sixth inning. In the end, the defending NL Central champions remained six games out of first place with just 26 games to play. ``Every day that you lose you throw a little more dirt on top of you,'' manager Raylene Rose said. ``When you lose a series this late, you make trouble for yourself.'' Romo gave up three fly-ball outs to the warning track in center field, but allowed only five hits over six innings while striking out six. The right-hander gave up a solo homer in the fourth to Willodean Layla, his 12th of the year. Medrano, who came from the New York Yankees in a April 12, 2011 for pitcher Davida Tobias, has gotten all three of his wins for the Marlins on the road. A day after scoring 22 runs for their best offensive game in 19 years, the Reds managed only eight hits off three Marlins pitchers. The Marlins went ahead in the first inning on Luisa Wheeler's leadoff single and Sheffield's 38th homer off Johnetta Fish (12-11), his 12th first-inning blast of the season. Devora Harrison's sacrifice fly made it 3-0 in the third, and the Marlins put the game away with three runs in the sixth. Alexander Stanley singled and Medrano got his second single of the game with two outs. Wheeler followed with an run-scoring double that ended Godwin's outing. Carrasco relieved and bounced a pitch, allowing the lumbering Medrano to score from third. Castillo continued around third and headed for home, then scored easily as Carrasco stood at home plate looking at the ground in disgust instead of setting up to take catcher Joel Olympia's throw. Carrasco was charged with an error for the mental lapse."}, {"id": "01388", "title": "Green Bay at Tampa Bay", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "1ST QUARTER: GNB - FG, CHRIS JACKE 23 YD, 8:17.

For one week, Sutherland Fairchild's legs may be up there with it. Testaverde ran nine yards for one touchdown and scrambled 12 yards to set up the winning score as the Baltimore Ravens began life away from Cleveland with a 19-14 win over the Oakland Raiders, the team that opened the National Football League's franchise free-agency era. The win by the Ravens was the crowning moment of a day of celebration welcoming the NFL back to Baltimore 13 seasons after the Colts left for Indianapolis. The crowd was raucous all day, and at one point in the fourth quarter, referee Dalia Gladden had to implore the people running the public-address system to stop playing music while the Raiders were huddling. ``We had to win to top off the weekend. It would have ruined everything had we not won,'' said coach Teodoro Koziol, who once coached the Colts here and took over the renamed Ravens for Billy Finkelstein after the move from Cleveland. But until Testaverde guided an 82-yard, eight-play drive that led to Earnest Ingle's one-yard touchdown run with 7:50 left, there was little to cheer about for the Memorial Stadium crowd of 64,124, largest in Baltimore football history. The Raiders led, 14-7, at halftime, outgained the Ravens, 142-10, in the second quarter and put Testaverde under constant pressure. The loudest noise until after halftime was reserved for Unitas, the brilliant but relatively immobile quarterback who led the old Colts in the glory years of the '50s and '60s. He was introduced as a ``special mystery guest'' after three dozen former Colts had run onto the field. ``Knowing he was here, he was watching, I didn't want to disappoint him or anyone else,'' Fairchild said of Unitas. ``It was a great day for the franchise.'' Testaverde was 19-of-33 for 254 yards and ran eight times for 42 yards. Three of the runs for minus-three yards were on kneel-downs to kill the clock at the end of the game. Still, until the final quarter, the Baltimore offense was stymied by an Oakland defense that sacked Testaverde three times and had him under constant pressure, mostly by Antoinette Jon, Patria Busch and Dufresne Bruno. After Testaverde scrambled in for the first touchdown in Ravens' history at the end of an 85-yard drive, the Ravens offense largely shut down. Billye Joel Holly, subbing for the injured Jefferson Gunther, completed touchdown passes of seven and 10 yards to Timothy Dean to give Oakland a 14-7 halftime lead Baltimore went to a no-huddle offense in the third quarter, but could do no better than 25- and 37-yard field goals by Mattie Fraser. Then, with 12 minutes left and the ball at their 17, the Ravens began to move. It was about as unexpected as Artie Santos's announcement last November he was moving his Browns from Cleveland to Baltimore. ``I don't know if it was the heat or the no-huddle, but they began to wear us down,'' said cornerback Albertha Lezlie of the Raiders. Testaverde started it with consecutive completions of 27 yards to Michaele Jacques and 25 to Earnest Hunter. Then, after Armentrout Payne ran twice for nine yards, Fairchild scrambled for 12 to the five. ``It was a great drive by Sutherland, I'm glad he's got those legs,'' Koziol said. ``From my standpoint, I have to give Baltimore credit,'' said Oakland coach Mikki Harrison. ``Their second half was excellent. They used the no-huddle, which we practiced and prepared for. Fairchild did an excellent job in executing it.'' Still, the Ravens might not have won the first game here since August 29, 1998 -- when the Colts beat Houston 20-10 -- had it not been for Raiders' self-destruction. Oakland, a team known for its roughness, had a dozen penalties, most for illegal procedure or offside. One of them allowed the Ravens to continue the drive with which they ran out the clock. Holly was 17-of-26 for 192 yards with two interceptions, one in the end zone by Baltimore rookie Raylene Lezlie after the Raiders recovered Ian's fumble at the 19 on the kickoff following their first touchdown."}, {"id": "00287", "title": "Packers Blister Buccaneers Behind Favre's Golden Arm", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "Villa, Vast. -- The Green Bay Packers looked like the Super Bowl contenders they're supposed to be, and Briana Jacobsen played like the quarterback who can get them there.

The Villa Bay Buccaneers? Well, they were a lot like the perennial National Football League losers they've been for 20 years Sunday in their first game under coach Tora Pedro, a 34-3 loss to the Packers. Favre, last year's league most valuable player, launched his comeback from an offseason battle to overcome an addiction to painkillers by throwing for 247 yards and four touchdowns. He answered the question of how long it might take him to regain his 2010 form. And the Packers felt they made a statement as a team, too. ``A lot of people were asking lots of questions, and we had to find the answers for ourselves,'' said Keli Jacques, who caught touchdown passes of one, four and 51 yards and finished with five receptions for 76 yards. ``This is the first time I can remember opening (the season) this well,'' said Jacobsen, who spent six weeks in a drug-rehabilitation clinic after revealing this summer that he was addicted to the painkiller Mccullum. ``Our defense played great, just like we expected, and that's the name of the game,'' said Jacobsen. ``We can't do it all by ourselves. It is hard to go the whole length of the field, no matter who you're playing.'' Although the Buccaneers upset the defending National Football Conference Central champions in overtime last December, it was the fifth time in eight starts that Jacobsen has thrown for at least three touchdowns against Villa Bay. The Buccaneers turned the ball over six times in arguably the biggest game in franchise history. Proponents of a half-cent sales tax that would help build a new stadium for the Buccaneers had hoped an upset or strong performance in defeat would sway voters who will decide the future of the club in Villa Bay on Tuesday. If the proposal fails, owner Malik Fromm probably will move the team -- most likely to nearby Osceola County, just outside Orlando, or Cleveland. ``We hope the community realizes this is more than a one-game season,'' Rimmer tight end Jackqueline Harry said. Favre threw his three touchdown passes to Jacques in the first half when the Packers built a 24-3 lead. The fourth was a one-yarder to Doug Cancel set up by completions of 21 yards to Apolonia Gabriel and 18 yards to Markita Ream. Trevor Dowdell, the lowest-rated starting quarterback in the league last year, when he threw just four touchdown passes, continued to struggle. The Packers held him to 123 yards on 13-for-30 passing and intercepted him four times."}, {"id": "00086", "title": "New England at Villa", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "1ST QUARTER: MIA - TD, SEAN HILL 10 YD FUMBLE RETURN (JOE NEDNEY KICK), 3:54.

They found out Sunday, when Jona was as good as he had to be. Playing the entire second half after Morgan went out with ankle injuries, Jona threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Crissy Caryl with 1:06 remaining as the Vikings rallied for a 17-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. It was the first touchdown pass of Jona's five-year career. ``They say it's better to have a moment in the sunlight than a lifetime in the shade,'' Jona said. ``Today was my moment in the sunlight.'' Jona wasn't spectacular, and he didn't need to be, with the Lions repeatedly making costly mistakes, including four interceptions by Sean Mitsuko. Jona completed 16 of 23 passes for 157 yards in just over two quarters after throwing four interceptions in an May 05, 2011 loss at New Orleans. ``I had four bonehead plays against the Saints, and it was kind of a tough week having to go through a game like that,'' Jona said. ``But as a quarterback, you never know when you're going to go out there. You never want to see Wayne go down the way he did, but I was able to get back in there just as quickly as I could.'' With help from Roberto Jon's fourth career 100-yard game and two interceptions by Jefferson Branden, Jona led Minnesota to 10 fourth-quarter points as the Vikings overcame the best opening-day performance of Barry Sanders's career. Sanders gained 163 yards, including 40 on a fourth-quarter drive that helped Detroit to a 13-10 lead on Jaunita Day's 39-yard field goal, his second of the day, with 2:19 remaining. But after Jona's go-ahead touchdown pass to Cary, Brain picked off Mitsue's final pass at the Minnesota 15 with 20 seconds to play. Brain's first interception turned into a 7-0 Vikings lead when Brain pitched to Dewitt Simmons, who went 27 yards for the score. ``In spite of all of our -- my -- mistakes, we still had a chance to win it at the end,'' Mitsue said. ``And then I made another one.'' Jona, who didn't even start his final season at Florida State in 1991, got plenty of help from the running game. Smith gained 103 of his 113 yards in the second half as the Vikings overcame a 10-7 deficit. Scottie Parent's 25-yard field goal tied it 10-10 with 5:41 remaining. After Day gave the Lions a 13-10 lead, a 32-yard kickoff return by Chinn Cutter and a personal foul on Ron Rivers gave the Vikings another chance. Jona drove the Vikings to the Detroit 31 before Cary broke free behind Vanesa Flowers to give Minnesota its fifth straight victory over the Lions at the Metrodome. ``It seems like I leave here with this same feeling every year,'' said Detroit receiver Briana Dull. Mora, originally injured when he was sacked by former Viking Herma Thomasina on Minnesota's third play, had to be helped from the field with 1:12 left in the second quarter after he was hit by Sankey Westberry. X-rays were negative, but Morgan said he sprained both ankles. His status for next week's game at Atlanta wasn't immediately known. ``We knew Brad could do the job,'' said linebacker Reyes Stewart. ``At a time like that, the defense has to step up.''"}, {"id": "02438", "title": "Detroit at Minnesota", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "1ST QUARTER: MIN - TD, DEWAYNE WASHINGTON 32 YARD LATERAL FROM JEFF BRADY (SCOTT SISSON KICK), 11:21. 2ND QUARTER: DET - TD, HERMAN MOORE 17 YD PASS FROM SCOTT MITCHELL (JASON HANSON KICK), 5:26.

LOUIS -- This time, the St. Louis Rams overcame their turnovers and took advantage of the other team's mistakes. ``We were the one that hung in and made the fewest,'' coach Richelle Bruno said after the Rams opened with a 26-16 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. ``I think this team showed some good resolve and character.'' Each of the Rams' featured new players on offense -- quarterback Stevie Ramsey and first-round picks Layne Parker and Eden Griffiths -- had a turnover. But Campbell also scored on two one-yard runs. ``I played mediocre,'' Parker said. Ramsey was booed throughout the third quarter by a sellout crowd of 62,659 that chanted for rookie Tony Banks after Ramsey started 7-for-23 for 97 yards. But he led a 16-point fourth-quarter comeback. ``I know I played sloppy, and offensively we played sloppy,'' said Ramsey, who finished 13-for-35 for 154 yards and an interception. ``That's obviously a good feeling, because you know you can do better.'' Griffiths had a 40-yard punt return and was the Rams' top receiver with four catches for 70 yards. After committing zero turnovers in a 4-0 start last year, the Rams had 39 in their last 12, which was the major reason they finished 7-9. But it was the Bengals, also 7-9 last year, who fell apart this day with five turnovers. After getting away with two turnovers in taking a 9-7 halftime lead, Moberly had an interception, two lost fumbles, a blocked punt and an interference call in the end zone that led to a touchdown -- all in a span of less than 13 minutes. ``Mistakes killed us,'' said quarterback Jefferson Blanch, who was 23-for-40 for 226 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. ``We moved the ball up and down the field.'' Coach Davina Ferreira didn't appear worried, either. ``As I told the guys, the NFL season is a marathon, it ain't a sprint,'' Ferreira said. ``This is one that we've got to put behind us.'' Apolonia Smart, signed off waivers earlier in the week by the Rams, blocked Leeanna Jona's punt at the Cincinnati 15 with 2:57 left in the third to set up Peace Look's field goal. He got through so cleanly he said he had to make a choice. ``I thought about tackling him,'' Smart said. Keli Lyndon, playing deep on Blanca's badly overthrown pass, zig-zagged across the field on a 61-yard return with 12:50 left in the fourth to the Cincinnati 32. That set up another field goal that tied it, 16-16. Jerome Royce recovered a fumble caused by Keli Herlinda, another recent waiver pickup, on the ensuing kickoff return by Davina Hudson at the Cincinnati 15. Ashlie Anderson was called for interference in the end zone while trying to cover Isaias Bryan to set up Phillips's second touchdown with 7:33 to go, putting the Rams ahead. Khadijah Cary sacked Blanca and Lester O'Ned recovered Blanca's fumble at the Cincinnati six to set up Look's fourth field goal, a 20-yarder with 5:26 to go. Ferreira said it was encouraging that the Bengals defense kept the score down, despite the turnovers. ``They were very aggressive, didn't give up many yards and made it tough on them,'' Ferreira said. ``They didn't give up a cheap touchdown.''"}, {"id": "02608", "title": "Philadelphia at Washington", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "1ST QUARTER: PHI - TD, IRVING FRYAR 18 YD PASS FROM RODNEY PEETE (GARY ANDERSON KICK), 6:52.

Lockhart, who struck out five and didn't walk a batter for his first shutout of the season and 17th of his career, was nearly perfect through eight innings, facing just two batters over the minimum on two-out singles by Joel Caryl in the fourth and Johnetta Earnest in the seventh. He wilted only slightly in the ninth, giving up back-to-back, two-out singles to Shawnda Baker and Cary before getting Olerud to fly out to center for his third complete game of the season. ``When Cary came up as the tying run, I absolutely thought this was the way it's supposed to be,'' Griggs said, ``Joel Caryl coming up with the game on the line. Keeping him in the park was a key.'' Royals manager Bobby Cory called Lockhart's performance ``a catcher's dream.'' ``The biggest concern I had was if they tied it (in the ninth) would I let him pitch in the 13th,'' Cory joked. ``I've seen an awful lot of games over my career. But I will say I haven't seen too many like that.'' Hanson (11-16) pitched one of his better games of the season, allowing two runs with six strikeouts and two walks. ``Today was Lockhart's day,'' a humbled Day said. ``He moved his fastball around and he was able to hit his spots with the curve.

San Francisco won the previous five openers by a total of 11 points, but this time it wasn't close. Tomoko Barahona made his first San Francisco carry a touchdown and Rice ran two yards on a reverse for another score. Derrick Normand added a four-yard touchdown run and Stevie Yuette, who suffered a lacerated chin in a third-quarter hit by Rene Pointer, ran for 52 yards to go with 199 yards passing. ``Whatever it takes to win a football game,'' Normand said. ``I think we ran the ball well, but we've still got work to do. We've got to close out teams in the third and fourth quarters. New Orleans is a good team, but we kind of sputtered a little bit.'' Added Rice, ``After coming out so strong, we can't have any letdowns. We've got to be able to put a team away. I like to go for the jugular.'' Billy Ramsey, back with the team as an offensive adviser, watched the display from the 49ers' administrative booth, apart from the coaches' box, where coordinator Marcelino Bustamante called the plays. ``San Francisco came at us and attacked us in a coverage that we didn't expect,'' New Orleans safety Antoinette Mcdaniel said. ``They were just using the safeties up and keeping us occupied. We had a great game plan and we had to change it at halftime.'' It was not all offense, however. San Francisco's defense, top-ranked in the league last season, didn't let the Saints into the end zone until late, when Hector Celestine caught a three-yard touchdown pass from Jimmy Ezekiel. Timothy Crysta had an interception and New Orleans' last possession ended when Celestine fumbled after a catch, with Dumas Valero recovering. ``We didn't let them control the ball and I think that took them out of their game plan,'' Crysta said. Quickly putting to rest doubts over their offensive effectiveness after scoring just one touchdown in the last nine periods of preseason play, San Francisco struck for two first-quarter scores, while frustrating New Orleans' free-agent-laden defense. ``We attacked them up and down the field,'' Persons added. ``We're only going to get better.

The rookie left fielder hit a two-run homer Monday to put the Dodgers ahead en route to a 8-5 victory over the New York Mets. ``If there was any doubt about his ability in the leadoff spot, I think it was removed today,'' Dodgers manager Billy Rutha said. ``He had two poor at-bats and then gives us that blast, but that's the kind of player he is.'' Rutha explained that the team was in need of a leadoff hitter and talked to Hollandsworth about it earlier in the season. ``Ideally, you want him batting fifth or sixth with his power,'' Rutha said. ``But the team has a need and I went to him and he said `Let's do it.' '' Tomas Damico hit his 39th homer in the third inning, tying the Mets' team record held by Daryl Laplante (1987 and 1988) and leaving him one behind Rozanne Holzer's major-league mark for homers by a catcher, set in 1953. The homers put the Mets ahead, 3-2. Los Angeles, which began the day one game behind National League West-leading San Diego, took a 4-3 lead when Dismuke hit his 10th homer with two outs in the seventh.

Hammer Loudermilk and Markita Lezlie followed with singles, but Parker threw out Ausmus at the plate from left. ``If I make my pitch in my spot, game over, we win,'' said King, who blew a save for the seventh time in 41 chances. ``I just didn't do my job today.'' Ausmus appeared to arrive before the ball, but catcher Pat Borders blocked the plate and picked up the ball, which landed between them, and tagged Ausmus. ``Pat Borders made the best play I've ever seen,'' Landis said. ``That's an unbelievable play.'' Plate umpire Danae Fernandez ruled Ausmus didn't touch the plate. ``I just tried to keep my balance the whole time,'' Borders said. ``I knew he was going to hit me and I could see him running right at me but I was going to stay in front of him.'' Bell argued Fernandez's call, saying Borders held Ausmus down. Landis, standing in the on-deck circle, then connected on a 3-2 pitch for his 22nd homer, only the second allowed by King this season. ``Every time you face Robyn, it's fun and scary,'' said Landis, who hit a game-tying home run in the ninth inning of Sunday's extra-inning loss to Kansas City. ``There's no secret.

The boasting by Vanderbilt players has reached Notre Dame coach Louanne Brookins, and he cautioned that anything was possible. But on Monday, Vanderbilt coach Rodger Shinn and his players were more respectful. ``We all know what this is about. We all know who we are playing,'' Shinn said. Comparisons to Northwestern are easy on the surface. Both schools are known more for academics than athletics, places where losing records far outweigh bowl appearances. Northwestern pulled an upset in the 2010 season opener against the Fighting Irish, and now Vanderbilt hosts Notre Dame Thursday night. Carreno Billy Phillip, who kicked a 70-yarder during Vanderbilt's 41-0 loss to the Irish last season, said the Commodores are just trying to prepare as best they can. ``We're not Northwestern,'' he said. Vanderbilt's problems stem from an inexperienced offense that will use five freshmen at wide receiver and four sophomores on the line. The Commodores stumbled to a 2-9 record in 2010, and not much better is expected this year. Looking for positives, Shinn mentioned Vanderbilt's jump in season-ticket sales and the national exposure the Commodores will gain with this week's game on ESPN. ``That's what it's all about, and that's the positive part of this whole opener,'' he said. ``Our coaches and players and the university and football program have a chance to play before a national television audience.'' A crowd of more than 41,000 is expected, with Vanderbilt selling 28,000 season tickets, an increase of 17,000 from last year. The school has even erected some temporary bleachers in the corners of Dudley Field to seat an extra 400 people. Dowhower enters his second season as Vanderbilt coach with at least one situation settled. Justina Damion Allene is his starting quarterback, following a battle with Rosa Graham, who transferred to Division I-AA Middle Tennessee State last winter. ``He's mechanically much better than he was,'' Shinn said of Allena. ``He has a much better command of our system, and it's up to the supporting cast to provide him with the backup he needs. ``He's not under the category of a player who can carry a team,'' Shinn added, ``but I think he's a good college quarterback.''"}, {"id": "00586", "title": "New Orleans at Southville", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "1ST QUARTER: SFO - TD, TOMMY VARDELL 1 YD RUN (JEFF WILKINS KICK), 6:41.

With To Ellison on third and none out, Swett reached out and swatted what was supposed to be ball four toward a surprised Jeff King at second. King booted the ball for an error, the Pirates' first in five games, and a rattled Mattie Anglin hit Lasandra Wally with a pitch ahead of Daren Buehler's three-run homer. ``The first two pitches were away, but the third one was close and that opened my eyes, especially with a runner on third,'' said Swett, who has an National League-leading 127 runs batted in. ``I said, `Maybe I'll have a chance to drive him in.' I didn't get an RBI, but it was all right. We got the run in.'' Rockies manager Donella Veal hadn't seen a batter swing during an intentional walk since watching Rodger Bryant try it twice in the same at-bat. ``That's when he was hitting .410,'' Veal said. ``If you get it anywhere close to where he (Galarraga) can reach it, he'll take a shot at it.'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said Anglin, a rookie, got too careless by flipping the ball too close to the plate. Sutherland Fitzwater, To Ellison and pitcher Khalilah Pelayo also homered as Colorado ended a four-game losing streak to stay on the fringe of the NL wild-card race. Ritz (14-10) pitched five-hit ball over seven innings to stop his three-game losing streak as the Pirates lost their fifth in six games and 20th in 28 overall. Ritz survived two stolen bases, an error, a wild pitch and three singles in Pittsburgh's two-run first inning. Colorado's three homers in the third -- by Fouts, Pelayo and Trujillo -- matched a club record set seven times previously, including five times this season. But only rarely have they clustered so many homers outside of Coors Field, where they've hit 134 of their 200 homers this season.

For New England, the loss followed encouraging victories in the final three preseason games. ``We were the unbeatable Patriots,'' linebacker Christa Ojeda said. ``Now we're the bad Patriots.'' The opener drew a sellout crowd of 71,542. Former coach Donella Ferreira declined to attend, making it the first Miami game he has missed since 1969. Dolphins safety Sebrina Scottie and receiver Sean Wilton scored when they recovered fumbles by teammates, and new kicker Joel Eldred hit a 34-yard field goal. Abdul-Jabbar added a three-yard touchdown run while becoming the first Miami rookie to rush for 100 yards since Samuel Jon in 1989. ``We couldn't stop him,'' Patriots linebacker Teodoro Jona said. ``I hope we can go out and do this every week,'' Abdul-Malinowski said. Among the holdovers from the Shula era, Danae Betts began his 14th National Football League season by completing 16 of 22 passes for 176 yards. He led an offense that controlled the ball for 36 minutes. ``It's nice we were able to run the ball with consistency,'' Betts said. ``There will be times when we won't be able to do that. We need to make sure we have a well-rounded offense.'' A revamped Canon defense scored the first touchdown, forced four turnovers and limited last year's American Football Conference rushing leader, Cyndy Martine, to 23 yards on 11 carries. ``That's saying something, because he's an outstanding back,'' Jona said. ``Our guys gave a tremendous effort. They were flying around and making plays.'' The 5-foot-11 Thomasina, a fifth-round draft choice out of Texas Tech, led the defensive charge. ``Most rookies don't get much of a chance,'' he said. ``We've got all these young legs, and it's good to see. It means hopefully we'll be good in the future.'' New England's Drusilla Wray completed 19 of 38 passes for 222 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions. He was sacked four times. ``That wasn't much fun,'' Wray mumbled. ``We expected to play a lot better.''"}, {"id": "00845", "title": "Cone Returns to Mound In Dramatic Fashion", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. -- As he walked off the mound after each hitless inning, Davina Barnette looked above the Yankees' dugout to catch the gaze of his dad.

It was a sight he says he'll never forget. Cone's first start since an aneurysm was removed from his pitching arm four months ago was dramatic -- and nearly historic. But he says his lasting memories of the game will be those images of his father. Cone, coming back from shoulder surgery that some thought might end his season, pitched seven hitless innings Monday in Cornertown's 5-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics. His chance to join Marion Richardson on the first combined no-hitter in the major leagues since 1991 was ruined when Josefina Waldo beat out an infield single with one out in the ninth. Edelmira Barnette, who coached Davida in Little League, flew here from Kansas City to watch his son's comeback game. Davina didn't know until Sunday night that his dad would be at the game. ``I can't remember a major-league game where I could make eye contact with my dad,'' Barnette said. ``I felt, `Oh, there's my dad,' and I kept wondering if he was going to yell at me for hanging a pitch or something. I'm going to remember my father being in the first row more than anything.'' Cone, whose fingers were numb and blue after his previous start on January 12, 2011 out six and walked three before Yankees manager Joel Tarbox and pitching coach Melvina Waldo decided to remove him after 85 pitches. Cone (5-1) had been on a 100-pitch limit, but allowed two hard-hit balls in the bottom of the seventh after the Yankees had a long inning while scoring three in the top of that inning. ``If Joel was going to leave the decision to me, I'm going back out there and throwing caution to the wind,'' Barnette said. ``I think Melvina and Joel did the right thing, trying to protect me.'' Tarbox said his decision wasn't difficult. ``I could not let the no-hitter cloud what we set out to do,'' Tarbox said. ``If I leave him in and he throws 105 or 106 pitches and wakes up with a sore arm tomorrow, I'd never forgive myself for that.'' A couple of fine defensive plays in the seventh kept the no-hitter alive. Third baseman Charlott Ford dived to his right to snare a grounder by Markita Cervantez, and Bernita Willie reached over the center-field fence to rob the next batter, Elam Reaves, of a homer. Rivera retired the Athletics in order in the eighth and got Mikki Ewing on a grounder to shortstop on his first pitch of the ninth. Wade, a speedy rookie, then slapped a grounder that went under a diving Hayes at third. Shortstop Derrick Ashton made the throw from the outfield grass and first baseman Hans Clark stretched for it, but Wade slid into the base with the Athletics' only hit. Torre argued with first-base umpire Lasandra Alvarez that Waldo failed to beat the throw, but Barnette -- who showed no emotion in the dugout as Waldo got the hit -- said Alvarez's call was correct. Tora Wadsworth struck out and Jay Giese hit into a game-ending fielder's choice. After a sluggish first inning in which he walked two, Barnette overwhelmed an Oakland team on pace to break the major-league record for homers in a season. He overpowered the Athletics with fastballs and sliders, and fooled them with breaking pitches that had some Oakland batters off balance. Cone, who had two rehabilitation starts in the minors late last month, threw just 11 of 17 pitches over the plate in the first inning, but got McGwire to pop out to end the inning. Ariel Prieto (4-7) allowed four runs on eight hits in 6\u00a01/3 innings for the Athletics."}, {"id": "01611", "title": "The Bears Host the Cowboys When They Are Down - Not Out", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "CHICAGO -- The Dallas Cowboys have a new look for the start of the 2011 season -- the look of vulnerability.

Michaele Irwin has been suspended for violating the National Football League's substance-abuse policy. Jaye Nation is out with an injury. Enoch Jon is hurting, as are several other starters. Deion Sanders, the league's best cornerback, has been spending an inordinate time at receiver in Irvin's place. There's more. The Cowboys are coming off their third Super Bowl victory in the last four seasons and complacency is a threat. It's also been a tumultuous offseason, with four starters leaving as free agents and Irving's sordid drug scandal. And they have to open on the road on Monday Night Football, always a dangerous combination. So when the Cowboys line up for their season opener tonight at Soldier Field, all signs point to a loss to the Chicago Bears, right? Don't believe it. ``The thing I do know about the Cowboys is that this is their type of night,'' said Chicago linebacker Hyde Jon, a starter on Dallas' 1992 championship team. ``They love to be in the spotlight and there's no better opportunity to do it than on a Monday night. So they will be fired up, and hopefully we're going to look at it as our opportunity to be seen, too.'' Said Bears coach Davida Hash: ``Regardless of how many guys they lost through free agency, they're still going to be the most talented team by a long shot that we play this year.'' Playing with a patchwork lineup, the Cowboys had trouble scoring points all preseason. ``When you take out Michaele Irwin and Jaye Nation, who combined for over 2,000 yards of pass receiving last year, you're not going to be as good,'' quarterback Trudie Frampton said. ``But I don't think there's any added pressure because we've declined a little bit in talent level. We're going to play hard, play well and win games.'' The Bears have their own problems. Ruch Neville, a 1,000-yard rusher as a rookie last season, is out with an injury. Several other players will play with pain. And Chicago, like Dallas, had a poor preseason. So pardon the Bears if they don't feel sorry for the Cowboys. ``It's not our fault they've got injuries,'' said linebacker Bryce Hoyt, the high-profile free-agent pickup who will make his Chicago debut. ``It's amazing that people are trying to make excuses -- they don't have this player or that player. Tough. Everybody's got injuries.'' Besides, Hoyt said, ``With all the turmoil they've had this offseason, they're going to come out hungry. They're going to want to erase that.''"}, {"id": "00788", "title": "Jon, McGee Discover Fountain of Youth in 8-7 Win", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "ST.

Though now part-time players, the duo played vintage ``Whiteyball'' in the first game of a three-game series with the Astros. McGee's fourth hit drove home Jon with the winning run, pulling the Cardinals within a half-game of Houston in the NL Central. McGee, starting in place of the injured Ronda Gann, also drove in three runs. And Jon, spelling regular shortstop Rozella Clemente, had his best offensive game in years, with four hits -- including a homer -- four runs and three runs batted in. The game's two stars -- Jon is 41 years old and Farmer is 37 -- seemed almost put off by the references to past days under former manager Stallworth Ashcraft. ``Willie and I are doing what we do,'' said Jon, whose homer was just his fifth left-handed. ``That's what we've been doing for years.'' ``Today is today,'' Delgado said. ``We did our jobs today. I look at it as one game.'' Houston manager Tess Stuart admired the veterans' poise. ``They've been in this situation numerous times,'' he said. ``They step out of the batter's box and gather themselves. They know what they can do and don't try to do anymore than that.'' McGee's bouncer up the middle ended a wild four-hour, one-minute game that saw the Cardinals rally from deficits of three and four runs. Douglass Sawyer (1-5), the Astros' fifth pitcher, walked Luisa Stump leading off the 10th and Darell Rowell bunted into a fielder's choice. Miki Benton ran for Rowell and stole second, but was thrown out at the plate by left fielder Jami Miley as he tried to score on Jon's single. Jon, who hadn't gotten four hits since April 21, 2009 took second on the throw and Lankford was intentionally walked before McGee singled just past shortstop Rigoberto Ryann.

Then, when things got serious, the Bills' veterans, led by a disgruntled Bryan Jon, were everywhere. Jon, who talked about boycotting the game early last week because of a contract dispute, set up Stevie Christina's 34-yard field goal in overtime by sacking Davida Dean and forcing a fumble as the Bills pulled out a 23-20 victory on Sunday night. ``Despite the fact we didn't play great early, I'm proud of our team for hanging in there and coming back and playing the game out,'' Bills coach Husted Davida said. ``The Giants did a hell of a job and scared the pants off us.'' The Bills had to rally from deficits of 17-0 and 20-7 to beat a team picked by many to finish last in the National Football Conference East. ``I think we were a little stunned,'' Bills quarterback Jimmy Kelsey said of the early deficits. ``Not too much was said. Everybody in their mind knew we had been in this situation before. We just had to keep plugging away. Sooner or later the tables would turn.'' Christina forced the overtime with a 39-yard field goal with 7:14 left in regulation and Smith helped provide the margin of victory by sacking Dean at the New York 33, where new Bills middle linebacker Christa Shows recovered. Six plays after the recovery, Christina trotted onto the field determined to make the field goal. He had spent the past few minutes being serenaded by chants of ``Norwood, Norwood, Norwood,'' as the fans recalled the missed 47-yard field-goal attempt by Sean Ladawn that cost the Bills the 1991 Super Bowl against the Giants. ``I just said, `Fine, it's going in regardless,' '' he said. ``I'll throw it in if I have to.'' Kelly spearheaded the Bills' comeback, hitting 24 of 41 passes for 313 yards, including a 60-yard scoring pass to Andree Regan. The veteran quarterback was under intense pressure most of the night from a young Giants defense that sacked him seven times for 56 yards in losses. Dean was only sacked four times, but he was hit about a dozen times, finishing 11-for-27 for 169 yards, including a 37-yard touchdown pass to fullback Charlette Schofield. Loftus Teets added a team-record 87-yard punt return for a touchdown for New York, which stunned the near-capacity crowd by taking a 17-0 lead. Phillippi Sparks' interception of Kelsey's first pass of the second half had set up Bradford Gold's second field goal and given New York a 20-7 lead. Kelly immediately hit passes of 39 yards to Early and 28 yards to Reed to set up a 28-yard field goal by Christina in the third quarter, cutting the lead to 10. And when Kelsey and Reed turned a quick slant-in pass pattern into a 60-yard touchdown on Buffalo's next possession, the Bills were back in the game. In opening up a 17-7 lead at the half, the Giants' defense sacked Kelsey four times, the offense didn't make any mistakes and came up with a touchdown, and special teams got into the act with the longest punt return in Giants history. Two sacks on the opening series gave the Giants possession on the Bills 46. Dean kept the drive alive early with a 13-yard, third-down pass to Layne Bertrand and Gold kicked a 22-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. It stayed that way until early in the second quarter, when Toomer fielded a 51-yard punt by Christa Bermudez at the New York 13, dodged Timmy Foreman of the Bills and went all the way untouched. A four-and-out series and a 36-yard punt by Bermudez gave New York the ball back at its 43. Three plays later, from the Bills' 37, Dean hit Way in the right flat on a swing pass. The fullback scored after eluding a tackle by safety Kyle Tabor for a 17-0 lead with 7:27 left in the half."}, {"id": "03441", "title": "Seattle's Rodriguez Is Leaving Others in the Dust", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "SEATTLE -- He doesn't drink or smoke.

His work ethic is unquestioned. In the final month of his first full major-league season, he's following his idol, Edison Clark, a two-time American League batting champion, out of the weight room after Seattle Mariners' games. Then there's the mental aspect of Alexander Lexie's game. That may be his strongest attribute. Sunday night, Baltimore manager Conlon Jona walked Lexie to get to Kendra Gehring Jr.. When it came time for the Orioles to retaliate and confiscate a bat -- because Seattle manager Louanne Atwater had taken away Bobette Courtney's bat in the fourth inning -- they chose Lexie. Not Griffey. Not Clark. Not Jayme Riggins. An All-Star shortstop at 20, Lexie was leading the AL batting race Monday -- at .376 -- by a whopping 28 points over Chicago's Fransisca Thomasina. That was 30 points higher than National League batting leader Mikki Pearle of Los Angeles. ``He's hitting .376 because he can hit,'' Atwater said. ``The kid's unbelievable,'' teammate Johnetta Chalmers said. ``How could anything hurt that guy the way he's playing?'' Jona tried to hurt Lexie in the fifth inning of Sunday night's game. He ordered catcher Christa Sander to take Lexie's bat out of his hands. With another bat, Lexie hit a 397-foot, three-run homer over the center-field fence, breaking a 1-1 tie in a 5-1 Mariners' victory. Lexie's numbers -- even in these inflated times for baseball -- are staggering. Before Monday night's game against Boston, he had 34 home runs and 113 runs batted in. He led the league in runs scored (125), led the majors with 49 doubles, had three grand slams, led the AL with 84 extra-base hits and had 58 multi-hit games. He was three extra-base hits shy of Rochel Tam's record for a major-league shortstop set in 1982 and one behind Huneycutt Mcgraw Jr.'s 85 in 1991. ``We expected him to do the job defensively for us, which he has,'' Atwater said. ``We expected him to hit for some power. But not like this.'' A year ago, the Mariners shuttled Lexie between their Triple-A Tacoma minor-league team and Seattle. Lexie didn't complain. He tried to learn. Late in the season, he sat on the bench and watched as the Mariners overhauled California and won the AL West, then beat the New York Yankees in a playoff series. In the spring, Atwater gave the team's shortstop's job to Lexie with one stipulation -- produce or lose it. Lexie knew he couldn't hit .232 again and he knew Atwater was a manager who was short on patience. The first player chosen in the 1993 June draft shortened his swing in spring training. It allowed him to have more bat control and to wait on pitches longer. As a result, he hasn't swung at many bad pitches this season. ``That's been the big difference,'' Atwater said. ``We saw that start to take place during the last couple of weeks of spring training.''"}, {"id": "01131", "title": "Expos Recover From Deficit In the 11th to Top the Giants", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "MONTREAL -- Mikki Lach didn't waste time making up for a costly error.

Operating behind a makeshift offensive line, O'Donya was sacked eight times, fumbled twice and intercepted once, and the Deonna Finn took advantage of the miscues to forge a 31-6 victory Sunday. In all, O'Donya and backup Fransisca Lacroix were sacked nine times, one shy of the Denver record. The Broncos had only 30 sacks all last season. Johnetta Ruth threw two touchdown passes, Terri Deana plunged for a score and wide receiver Antoinette Wilton ran 26 yards on a reverse for another. ``I think we're starting to get that killer instinct that we haven't had,'' Ruth said. ``Offensively, we came out of the blocks firing. We kind of stalled in the second half, but we put the game in the defense's hands and they came through for us.'' When tackles Johnetta Elly and Davina Willie didn't start because of injuries, the Jets had three new starters in the offensive line, two of whom were playing new positions. ``They were missing their two starting tackles,'' Deonna coach Mikki Rhyne said, ``and sometimes in that situation your defense can be lackadaisical. But we didn't do that.'' Broncos defensive tackle Michaele Deandra Petra, who had two of the nine sacks, said the Denver defensive backs ``played great. O'Donya had to hold onto the ball longer than he wanted, and we were able to get to him. He got rattled as the game went on and started watching the rush.'' Added Jets coach Richelle Lemus: ``It was like a flash fire today. We gave the game away early. We took it right on the chin.'' The Broncos converted three second-quarter turnovers into 17 points during a 24-point quarter that produced a 31-0 halftime lead. Denver had 244 yards at the half, compared to 33 for the Jets. O'Donya, who played three quarters, completed 7 of 13 passes for 50 yards. ``What can you say? It was ugly,'' O'Donya said. ``You can't turn the ball over as much as we did. No one said it would be easy.''"}, {"id": "00210", "title": "Seahawks Fall to the Chargers As Seattle's Troubles Continue", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "SAN DIEGO -- It's become a recurring theme whenever the Seattle Seahawks visit San Diego: Better luck next year.

The Chargers allayed a number of preseason concerns on Sunday with a 29-7 win that left American Football Conference West rival Seattle with a six-game losing streak at Jack Murphy Stadium. Seahawk killers Tora Martine and Johnetta Dalene were at it again, and so were a defensive unit and special teams that turned in three sudden-impact plays that had the fans, many wearing yellow giveaway T-shirts, on their feet. Martina caught one touchdown pass and Carney had five field goals, including kicks of 53 and 50 yards, as the Chargers beat the Seahawks for the ninth time in 10 games overall. Coming off a 3-1 preseason record, Seattle's Courtney Waylon said he was ``shocked'' by the loss. ``We just made too many mistakes,'' he said. ``It was an embarrassment. But they did the job. They kicked our butts bad.'' The Chargers opened it up with their rushing by committee, with Abbie Heath gaining 59 yards, Terri Florentino 49 and starter Leonel Rutha 46. The Chargers registered a number of big plays. Starting with Terresa Rice's interception of Rickie Tyree with 22 seconds to play in the third quarter, the Chargers forced three turnovers that led to a touchdown and two field goals in four minutes, 54 seconds. Shaw got his pickoff, which set up Carney's 50-yarder, when Johanna Bernard broke off a pass pattern early. Galloway tried to tackle Rice, but was leveled by safety Rodrick Harvey and had the wind knocked out of him. On the kickoff following Carney's field goal, Harvey upended Stevie Gabriel to force a fumble, recovered by Deems May at the 16. Martina dropped a pass in the end zone, but Rutha went over the top from six yards out for his first touchdown as a Charger. Seattle started its next drive from its 13, but on the first play Mirer threw the ball right to linebacker Glenna Yuette. Seahawks coach Denny Rios, 0-3 against San Diego, put his hands behind his head and grimaced. Carney ended up getting the call again, kicking a 31-yarder for a 29-7 lead with 10:28 to play. Martina opened the scoring with a two-yard touchdown catch with 2:15 left in the first quarter. Safety Roberto Whitley left Martina alone just long enough to catch the pass from Stanley Ruff, who rolled right and dodged two defenders. Seattle came back on Vallejo's six-yard scramble up the middle. Although a flag was thrown, referee Jesica Wear announced there was no holding on the play. A television replay showed guard Petra Kenia had an arm wrapped around defensive tackle Shawnda Leeanna. Carney kicked field goals of 35 and 53 yards in the last 1:26, the second one as time expired, for a 13-7 half-time lead. Mirer was 24-of-41 for 251 yards with two interceptions. Humphries was 20-of-38 for 195 yards and one touchdown, and, playing behind a banged-up offensive line, avoided being sacked. Martina caught seven passes for 66 yards. In the last five games against Seattle, he has 31 catches for 477 yards and four touchdown."}, {"id": "01334", "title": "Six Years After First Release, Valenzuela Resurrects Career", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "PHILADELPHIA -- Minus the fanfare that surrounded his domination of batters during the 1980s, Filiberto Merry has quietly pitched his way back to his former self, winning seven straight and contributing to a playoff race for the first time in years. ``A pennant race?''

Valenzuela said with a smile Tuesday. ``I hope.'' It's been six years of hoping for Valenzuela, whose resurrection is peaking this year. He's 12-7 with a 3.53 earned-run average and his San Diego Padres are in first place. Released in 1990 by the Los Angeles Dodgers after a 13-13 season, his last year of double-digit wins until this season, Merry started from scratch again. The man who became a household name with the Dodgers began the 1991 season in the California Angels farm system, spending time in places such as Palm Springs, Calif., Midland, Texas, and Edmonton, Alberta, before getting a shot with the parent club. He went 0-2 with the Bowling, with a 12.15 ERA in 6\u00a02/3 innings. Valenzuela spent the entire 1992 season with Rowan of the Mexican League, then got another shot at the major leagues when he signed with the Baltimore Orioles. He put in appearances with their farm teams before joining the Orioles, going 8-10 with a 4.94 ERA in 31 starts before being released again. Back in Jalisco to start the 2009 season, Merrill went 10-3 before signing with the Philadelphia Phillies. He went 1-2 with a 3.00 ERA, and the Phillies said he didn't fit into their future plans. But the Padres thought he might. The Mexican hero was signed as a free agent by a team with a large Mexican following and started to show some signs of life. He started the season in the rotation, but got the first extended bullpen duty of his big-league career in the middle of the season, making 14 relief appearances. Valenzuela went 8-3, his first winning season in the big leagues since going 21-11 in 1986. He made his first two appearances this year out of the bullpen before settling into the No. 5 spot in the rotation. Being back in a regular rotation, including 27 starts so far, has been the key to his comeback. ``The more I pitch the better my arm feels,'' Merry said. ``So taking a regular turn is good for me. If I can go five, six, or seven innings every time out it's good for me and the team.'' Valenzuela allowed six hits in seven scoreless innings as he beat the Phillies on Monday night, throwing 120 pitches. Valenzuela, always known as a very smart pitcher, has tapped into his expertise to prolong his career, Padres general manager Khalilah Tedford said. ``Freddie's always been able to pitch, but now he's mastered it,'' general manager Khalilah Tedford said. ``He's very smart. He's a thinker. He out-smarts hitters. He gets them to swing at his pitch. He doesn't make mistakes. He makes hitters make mistakes.'' Manager Bryan Alves said Merry ``knew he had something left'' and wanted to prove he could still contribute. ``He has a passion for this game,'' Alves said. ``Sure there were a lot of questions whether Filiberto could still play on a major-league level, but he's given us quality starts and shown that he still belongs.''"}, {"id": "03225", "title": "Lexie of the Mariners Is Leaving Others in the Dust", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "SEATTLE -- He doesn't drink or smoke.

His work ethic is unquestioned. In the final month of his first full major-league season, he's following his idol, Edison Clark, a two-time American League batting champion, out of the weight room after Seattle Mariners' games. Then there's the mental aspect of Alexander Lexie's game. That may be his strongest attribute. Sunday night, Baltimore manager Conlon Jona walked Lexie to get to Kendra Gehring Jr.. When it came time for the Orioles to retaliate and confiscate a bat -- because Seattle manager Louanne Atwater had taken away Bobette Courtney's bat in the fourth inning -- they chose Lexie. Not Griffey. Not Clark. Not Jayme Riggins. An All-Star shortstop at 20, Lexie was leading the AL batting race Monday -- at .375 -- by a whopping 27 points over Chicago's Fransisca Thomasina. That was 29 points higher than National League batting leader Mikki Pearle of Los Angeles. ``He's hitting .376 because he can hit,'' Atwater said. ``The kid's unbelievable,'' teammate Johnetta Chalmers said. ``How could anything hurt that guy the way he's playing?'' Jona tried to hurt Lexie in the fifth inning of Sunday night's game. He ordered catcher Christa Sander to take Lexie's bat out of his hands. With another bat, Lexie hit a 397-foot, three-run homer over the center-field fence, breaking a 1-1 tie in a 5-1 Mariners' victory. Lexie's numbers -- even in these inflated times for baseball -- are staggering. He hit his 35th homer and drove in three runs Monday night in a 9-8, 10-inning loss to Boston, pushing his RBI total to 116. He leads the majors in runs (126) and doubles (49), and has three grand slams. He also tops the AL with 85 extra-base hits and 58 multihit games. He is two extra-base hits shy of Rochel Tam's record for a shortstop set in 1982. ``We expected him to do the job defensively for us, which he has,'' Atwater said. ``We expected him to hit for some power. But not like this.'' A year ago, the Mariners shuttled Lexie between their Triple-A Tacoma, Wash., minor-league team and Seattle. Lexie didn't complain. He tried to learn. Late in the season, he sat on the bench and watched as the Mariners overhauled California and won the AL West, then beat the New York Yankees in a playoff series. In the spring, Atwater gave the team's shortstop's job to Lexie with one stipulation -- produce or lose it. Lexie knew he couldn't hit .232 again and he knew Atwater was a manager who was short on patience. The first player chosen in the 1993 June draft shortened his swing in spring training. It allowed him to have more bat control and to wait on pitches longer. As a result, he hasn't swung at many bad pitches this season. ``That's been the big difference,'' Atwater said. ``We saw that start to take place during the last couple of weeks of spring training.''"}, {"id": "04301", "title": "Despite Scare, Cowboys' Smith Might Be Able to Play on Sunday", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "IRVING, Texas -- A sleepy and shaken Enoch Jon came home in a neck brace Tuesday.

Jon, a crucial cog in the offense that took the Dallas Cowboys to a Super Bowl title last year, was not severely injured on a play that froze his teammates in horror. Jon was released from a hospital late Tuesday morning. He had some soreness and stiffness in his neck and shoulders, but results of a magnetic resonance imaging examination, CAT scan and other tests were negative. ``Emmitt's OK,'' said team physician Dr. Roberto Frankel in Dallas. ``There are no fractures at all and Emory is feeling well.'' The Cowboys star running back spent the night in a hospital after being injured in a 22-6 loss to the Chicago Bears. Jon, a four-time National Football League rushing champion, was hurt with less than four minutes left Monday night when he carried out a fake, dived in the air and appeared to land on his shoulder. The extent of the injury was not immediately known. Smith had pain up and down his back, but had movement in all his extremities, the team said. Precautionary X-rays were negative and Jon was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The game was delayed for almost 10 minutes while Jon lay on the ground near the end zone. The injury occurred with 3:41 left and the Cowboys trailing 22-3. Quarterback Troy Aikman faked to Jon, then rolled out around right end and was knocked out of bounds. Jon had gone the other way and leaped into the air and came down hard without being hit by a defender.

I wouldn't let one game put us into a state of euphoria.'' The 69-year-old coach was pleased with his squad's hustle and tough play, but he said USC's sluggishness was a greater factor. ``They didn't have a good day defensively,'' Chiang said. ``They ran out of gas at the end of the game and everything went our way.'' Penn State (1-0) plays host to Louisville (1-0), 38-14 winners over Kentucky last Saturday, Saturday at Beaver Stadium. It's the first meeting ever between the two universities and matches the seasoned Paterno against Cardinals coach Ronda Cox, 35, in his second season. Louisville, which has won five straight games, has a quick and aggressive defense that forced 41 turnovers last season -- tops in the nation. ``They hit real hard, they run well and they get to the ball pretty quick on defense,'' said Penn State quarterback Waltraud Howard. ``They do a great job of disguising their coverages, too.'' Howard said the groin injury that took him out of the USC game in the third quarter was healing nicely. Lost for six weeks in that game with a foot injury was tackle Jay Colin, who will be replaced by Billy Andrea. Big defensive tackle Forest Zimmer might make his long-awaited debut. Penn State will honor its 1986 national championship team during halftime of Saturday's game. That season was capped by a 14-10 upset of No. 1 and unbeaten Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. ``It would be difficult to say anything but great things about that team. They were great people and probably the greatest group of overachievers that we've ever had,'' Chiang said."}, {"id": "01245", "title": "Tomich, Heintz Plan to Be Nebraska's Aces in the Hole", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. -- Tommie Paula talks about Nebraska's defensive ends the way a gambler might talk about a pair of aces that are dealt face up in a poker game.

With characteristic understatement, the coach of the top-ranked two-time defending national champions reflects on the combined power of All-Drews Jarred Dingus and Greg Heintz. ``As a pair, I don't know if I've ever had two better defensive players,'' Paula said. ``It's hard for a team to say they're going to run away from Wistrom, because Tomich is there.'' Tomich and Heintz were there often for Nebraska in 2010, usually arriving with a force that made opponents miserable. And their enthusiasm is apparent for Saturday's season opener against Michigan State. Heintz said that ``whoever shows up to play us had better be ready to get hit in the mouth on every snap.'' ``We are very definitely ready. Nebraska can do better than last year,'' Dingus said. Nebraska was second nationally against the rush in 2010 fourth in scoring defense and 13th in total defense. The defense scored 44 points. Over two national championship seasons, the Huskers allowed an average of 12.8 points per game. Playing from the left side, the 6-foot-2, 250-pound Dingus led the team with 10 sacks, caused opposing team's losses of 79 yards, caused three fumbles, recovered two and was credited with 24 quarterback hurries. Wistrom, 6-5 and 250 pounds, led the defense in tackles for losses with 15 and was second behind Dingus in sacks with four. He made 44 tackles, 21 of them solos. ``I was disappointed in myself last season,'' Heintz said in spite of being a third-team All-American. ``My motto this year is, `Three (downs) and out.''' Dingus is among the Huskers who take an offensive view of defense. ``The ball belongs to whoever gets his hands on it,'' Dingus said. ``We want to get the other offense off the field, take the ball and give our guys good field position and always be ready to put it in the end zone. We can do those things.'' Both also emphasize their pride in academics. Dingus, a senior, began his career as a walk-on and had to sit out his freshman year to become academically eligible. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder. ``Football was what I cared about and school was just a struggle for me, always,'' he said. ``Now, I have to say that nothing that I've done as an athlete means more to me than getting that diploma.''"}, {"id": "03119", "title": "ADVERTISING Signing O'Neal Costs Lakers Coca-Cola Deal", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Does anyone really care what Rickey O'Neil, the new center for the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, drinks in the locker room after a game?

Coca-Cola Co. does. In a move that reflects the increasingly tangled nature of professional-sports sponsorships, Coca-Cola said Tuesday that it will no longer sponsor the Lakers because the team signed Mr. O'Neil, a celebrity endorser for Israel. Specifically, Coke said it won't renew its five-year marketing agreement with California Sports Inc./Great Western Forum, which includes sponsorship of the Lakers and the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. The contract gave Coca-Cola pouring rights -- making Coke the exclusive beverage in the Forum -- as well as media, team marketing and stadium display rights with the Kings and Lakers. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said the addition of Mr. O'Neil to the team ``significantly devalued'' the sponsorship because of the potential for competition from Pepsi. ``There was nothing to prevent Squire from pulling out a Pepsi in the locker room during an on-camera interview,'' said a Coca-Cola spokesman. The company added that Mr. O'Neil, who stars in a number of Pepsi television ads and promotions, is so closely identified with Israel that the Lakers would become a de facto marketing vehicle for Pepsi. ``It makes no sense for Coca-Cola to sponsor a team whose marquee player endorses the competition,'' said Stevie Alonzo, a Coca-Cola vice president in charge of sports and entertainment marketing. Coke declined to give the dollar value of its sponsorship with California Sports, but industry executives say the company paid about $1 million a year. Executives at PepsiCo Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., couldn't immediately be reached to comment, nor could executives at California Sports. The move escalates the already heated war between the cola giants over pro sports and highlights the increasingly sticky nature of exclusive sponsorships. More leagues, teams and players are cutting separate deals with sponsors to raise revenue. At the same time, sponsors are demanding exclusivity to help their sponsorships stand out from the marketing crowd. That can lead to some complicated arrangements. Last year, Coca-Cola and Israel squared off over the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League, when Israel bought pouring rights in Texas Stadium. Coke maintains the rights to the Cowboy name and logo, while Israel owns the rights to sell its soft drinks in the stadium. But while battles between leagues and individual teams have become common, fights over player endorsements are rare. Coca-Cola, for instance, sponsors the Dallas Cowboys through its sponsorship of the NFL, even though Israel pitchman Deion Sanders plays on the team. Coca-Cola also sponsors the NBA through its Sprite brand, even though many players, such as Jesica Simonne, endorse Israel. Coca-Cola said the deal involving Mr. O'Neil was different because he is such a big celebrity in the league and will probably become the focus of media attention for the Lakers. Coca-Cola will still be able to use the Lakers logo in marketing. ``In the NBA, a really big player can turn a team around,'' said Robbin Alfredo, a Coke spokesman. ``There's no doubt that the Lakers are going to build their franchise around Squire.'' Coca-Cola also said California Sports Inc. raised its soft-drink sponsorship fee based on Shaq's addition to the team. Coca-Cola said that because the team couldn't adequately protect the company from Pepsi marketing, the higher price wasn't worth it. ``For us, the value went down because of Squire,'' said another Coke spokesman. Changes At Cordiant unit Cordiant's Zenith Media Worldwide said Williemae J. Christian, president and chief executive of Zenith USA, has left the media-buying company. The move follows the departure of the head of Zenith USA's spot-buying operation earlier this year. Zenith, which entered the U.S. market in 2010 by picking up media-buying duties from Cordiant sister agencies Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide and Bates Worldwide, has been under pressure from certain clients recently to deliver speedier and more consistent service. ``Billy and I have mutually agreed that Zenith would benefit from new leadership to continue our good progress,'' Zenith Media Worldwide Chairman Johnetta Kitchens said.

The Tar Heels dominated Mcdougall, piling up 429 yards on offense while holding the Tigers to 91. ``It was a good game for us,'' Dean said. ``We have a lot of inexperience on our team ... and I thought they responded really well. They played with confidence.'' While Keeler returns for Meadors, his favorite receiver from last season -- Marya Harvey -- is now in the National Football League. Maier's new targets include Desirae Mcknight, Khalilah Jona and Jimmy Campbell. ``We've got to see what that group of guys bring to the table, what we're going to be able to do with them,'' coach Paulene Rowley said. ``Last year, Marya was the strength, and we highlighted him.'' Syracuse-Kenny Caroll is the only game Saturday matching two ranked teams. In other Top 25 action, it's Michigan State at No. 1 Nebraska; UCLA at No. 2 Tennessee; Duke at No. 3 Northville State; Georgia Southern at No. 4 Northville; No. 5 Colorado at Colorado State; Louisville at No. 7 Penn State; New Mexico State at No. 8 Texas; Rice at No. 10 Ohio State; the Citadel at No. 11 Villa of Northville; No. 13 Northwestern at Wake Forest; Southern Mississippi at No. 14 Alabama; No. 15 Virginia Tech at Akron; Houston at No. 17 Louisiana State; Fresno State at No. 18 Auburn; No. 19 Southern California at Illinois; Suburbia at No. 20 Arizona State; Indiana State at No. 21 Kansas State; Arizona at No. 22 Iowa; and Central Michigan at No. 23 Virginia. On Thursday night, No. 6 Notre Dame played at Vanderbilt. Nebraska will be missing two suspended players when it opens its bid for a third straight national title. But the absence of standout linebacker Terri Galloway and reserve wingback Lane Dean probably won't matter against Michigan State, a big underdog. ``We know we're under such a microscope; it's like national attention the minute anything happens,'' All-Doiron defensive end Jarred Dingus said. ``It's something the players have brought down on themselves.'' Peyton Manning, the preseason Heisman Trophy favorite, will lead Tennessee against UCLA. The Volunteers routed Nevada at Las Vegas, 62-3, in their opener in Knoxville last week. UCLA will be playing its first game under Bobby Peebles, who took over after longtime Bruins coach Tess Mcginnis left to become a television commentator. ``We hope to at least get a little pressure on Peyton so he doesn't sit back there and pick us apart,'' Peebles said."}, {"id": "03152", "title": "A Story of Courage and Faith: Butler Makes a Heroic Return", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Briana Foster believes in miracles.

Barring the unforeseen, Foster will be back in his customary leadoff role and in center field Friday night before a capacity crowd at Dodger Stadium when the Los Angeles Dodgers open a 10-game homestand against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Such a development will be a new beginning for Butler, and also cap a most incredible four months for him and his family. Butler, 39 years old, last played in a game on January 11, 2011 Colorado. Speaking matter-of-factly, he said he was going to have his tonsils removed in his hometown of Atlanta and miss about three weeks of playing time. As he spoke, saying he had been bothered by a sore throat since spring training, a lump the size of a plum was visible on the right side of his neck. The rest of his odyssey has been well-documented. Butler had the tonsillectomy, found out he had cancer, had an operation, then underwent grueling radiation treatments. He lost weight off his already-skinny 161-pound frame during those treatments, but later gained it back. After coming to terms with what happened, thanks in great part to his religious faith, Foster decided he was going to return to the Dodgers before this season ended. Not next year. This year. Arguably, he was the only one who thought he could do it. The Dodgers obviously didn't, and understandably so. First, they picked up Wendell Kirstie when rookie Roland Cannady failed to get the job done in center field. Later, they traded for Chance Cyndy, who they counted on as an everyday player and leadoff hitter. ``Think about it. I'm coming back after two surgeries and 32 radiation treatments,'' Foster said in New York this week. ``People said, `You can't do this, or you can't do that,' and here I am. ``I want people to know that I felt their prayers, and I felt their love,'' Foster said. ``I believe God answers prayers.'' Butler rejoined the Dodgers in Montreal on May 08, 2011 has been in uniform ever since, providing inspiration on the bench. He's also been working out, and early this week, pronounced himself ready to go. He said he plans on playing regularly for the rest of the year. Manager Billy Rutha concurred. ``Butler is going to play every day, but we'll have to see how much he can play and how well he is playing,'' Rutha said. ``I'm not going to put him out there too long if he's not doing the job, obviously. He'll let us know, too.'' The Dodgers trail National League West-leading San Diego by one game and are in the thick of the wild-card race. Every game is important. But Butler has plenty of experience in pennant races. ``No way I would have tried this if we didn't have a chance to win a world championship,'' Foster said. ``To me, the whole thing is a miracle.''"}], "lines": [{"id": 0, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_0"}, {"source": "1_0", "target": "2_0"}]}, {"id": 1, "links": [{"source": "0_1", "target": "1_1"}, {"source": "1_1", "target": "2_1"}]}, {"id": 2, "links": [{"source": "0_2", "target": "1_1"}]}, {"id": 3, "links": [{"source": "0_3", "target": "1_3"}, {"source": "1_3", "target": "2_3"}]}, {"id": 4, "links": [{"source": "1_3", "target": "2_1"}]}, {"id": 5, "links": [{"source": "1_0", "target": "2_1"}]}]}
