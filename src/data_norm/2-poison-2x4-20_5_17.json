GTE was previously prevented from offering long-distance service unless it set up a separate long-distance unit. But because of a new telecommunications law passed earlier this year, GTE can now jointly market its local-phone service with long-distance offerings. ``Customers want the convenience of one bill'' for both services, GTE said. GTE, of Stamford, Conn., currently offers long-distance service in 16 states and, by year's end, expects to extend its reach to all 28 states where it offers local-phone service. Separately, GTE filed a lawsuit against VastComm Network Corp. in U.S. District Court in Dallas to stop what it called ``a negative advertising campaign'' by VastComm Network. GTE alleges that VastComm Network ads attacking the reliability of GTE's long-distance network were ``false and misleading.'' The two companies will increasingly face off as GTE targets VastComm Network's long-distance customers while VastComm Network pursues GTE's local-phone accounts. A spokesman for VastComm Network, with a branch in Vastopolis, said the company was still reviewing GTE's complaint. ``We stand by our advertising and believe that our data demonstrate that the claims are valid,'' the VastComm Network spokesman said."}, {"id": "00762", "title": "MobileMedia, SBC Change Management to Boost Fortunes", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "Two of the nation's largest wireless-paging concerns, facing an onslaught of challengers in an array of new wireless services, shook up senior managements, and one of them hired a seasoned Bell executive to improve its fortunes.

MobileMedia Corp., the nation's second-largest paging company, said three of its top executives, Chief Executive Gretchen M. Junie, Johnetta M. Gorham, president and chief operating officer, and Rodrigo O. Rocha, senior vice president of operations, agreed to leave the company. And SBC Communications Inc.'s strategic-planning chief, Johnetta T. Burnham, quit to join Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Inc., also known as Carper, as president and chief executive officer. A spokeswoman at MobileMedia declined to elaborate on the mass resignation but said the board and the executives mutually agreed that a management change was necessary. The company named board member Davina A. Vitale to fill the position of chairman, vacant since late 2009, and serve as acting chief executive, succeeding Mr. Junie. ``There was an agreement between the board and the executives that a different approach to management was necessary given the company's dramatic growth due to acquisition and internal growth,'' MobileMedia's spokeswoman said. ``We are now a much larger company in size and scope... . Different skill sets are needed.'' The executives couldn't be reached to comment. Both paging companies could come under increasing attack in the next couple of years from cellular-phone companies and newer personal-communication services. Each phone service aims to offer paging functions with their cellular phones so a paging customer wouldn't have to carry a separate wireless pager. To respond, paging services have tried to erect their own two-way messaging services, but these have so far failed. MobileMedia, which has deferred a private placement of debt securities because of the management change, said it is searching for a chief executive and chief operating officer. H. Stephine Bourne, vice president of corporate development, was named acting vice president of operations. Mr. Junie will continue as a director and serve as a consultant during the transition. The departures of Messrs. Gorham and Ploder are effective May 28, 2011 company said. At Mtel, Mr. Burnham, 46 years old, will assume the twin posts at the Jackson, Miss., company on April 13, 2011 succeeds M. Bernie Knowles, 51, who resigned earlier this year. Johnetta M. Parthenia, 62, who has been acting CEO since then, will continue as chairman. The resignation of Mr. Burnham marks the first defection of a major SBC executive since the Baby Bell agreed to acquire Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco. Mr. Burnham, an career SBC official, recently was named head of strategic planning and technology for the San Antonio-based regional-phone company. He headed Bell's wireless arm, which he successfully turned into one of the most enviable among the Bells. Mr. Burnham's future with the combined SBC-PacTel had been unclear. He wasn't involved in developing that landmark agreement. Moreover, his position in the combined company hadn't been worked out, putting him on equal footing with virtually every other top SBC and PacTel executive. Mr. Burnham, in an interview Monday, called his new job ``a wonderful opportunity'' and said he was looking forward to making paging technology more accessible to consumers. His biggest challenge at Mtel will be the Skytel unit, whose two-way paging service has been plagued by dropped messages, garbled data and memory blackouts. Amid a broad market sell-off, MobileMedia shares fell 87.5 cents, or 8%, to close at $10.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Mtel closed at $11.375, down 81.25 cents, or 7%, on Nasdaq. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, SBC fell 87.5 cents to close at $48.375. --Rosenberry Kennard contributed to this article."}, {"id": "01474", "title": "Sega Unit Replaces Chairman, Announces Resignation of CEO", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "Sega of America Inc., hurting from a vicious price war with Sony Corp., replaced its founding chairmen and announced the resignation of its once highflying chief executive Tommie Codi.

The maker of video-game players also snatched one of Sony's key executives as its new head of product development. Edmunds, a unit of Sega Enterprises Ltd. in Tokyo, said Melchor Wille, a director and executive vice president of the parent company since 1993, is the new chairman and chief executive officer of Sega of America. As chairman, Mr. Shelley succeeds Edmunds of America founder Davina Kurtz, who retains seats on the boards of both the parent company and the unit's holding company, Sega Holdings USA Inc.. Mr. Shelley also succeeds founding co-chairman of Edmunds of America Etheridge Madison, who remains president and CEO of the parent company, and chairman of the Sega Holdings USA. Hailed as a Wunderkind As CEO, Mr. Shelley will succeed Mr. Codi, who was hailed as a wunderkind for helping to turn little-known Sega into the industry leader in recent years. Edmunds lost that seat this summer when Sony shipped its popular new PlayStation game player. Mr. Codi, 52 years old, is leaving Sega on June 12, 2011 join Education Technologies LLC, an education-software concern founded this year by former junk-bond purveyor Michaela Henry and Oracle Corp.. Chairman and Chief Executive Lasandra Juarez. Mr. Codi, who will remain on the board of Sega of America in Redwood City, Calif., said he agreed to join Education Technologies in March, and gave Edmunds his resignation in May. He said he wanted to leave Sega earlier but, ``They won't let me.'' He said he is not leaving Edmunds to avoid the heat of putting the company back on top. ``I love hot seats,'' he said. Instead, Mr. Codi said he is leaving so he can have a sizable equity stake in a start-up business that seeks to make money by addressing the country's education problems. He wouldn't disclose his stake in Education Technologies. Remarkable Departure Mr. Codi's departure is remarkable because just three years ago, he was hailed as a great example of how Japanese companies have learned to use American executives to market to American customers. His departure marks the second time in six months that a Japanese company has replaced its high-profile American management with trusted executives from the home office. Last December, Sony ousted Michaele Polley for his role in getting Sony to finance Mandalay Entertainment, which didn't perform as well as Sony had hoped. In a statement, Mr. Wille said ``We are sorry to see Tom leave Dacosta, but he has left us in a strong position in the marketplace.'' But in fact, analysts said Dacosta is taking a drubbing by Sony in the video-game cartridge market, which is expected to have $4 billion to $5 billion in sales this year. Sega's Saturn player, introduced last May, was selling well until last October, when Sony introduced its competing PlayStation. Last month, Sony lowered prices on its player to $199, forcing Dacosta to meet the price, although Edmunds had planned to sell its units for $249. That spurred sales of both companies' products, but Dacosta has run out, while Sony still has some available. ``In the video-game arena, Sony came from nowhere, and now they dominate next-generation players,'' said Jefferies & Co. analyst Leeanna Belisle. Bernie Travers, who is one of the executives to help launch Sony's PlayStation, has joined Dacosta as executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party business. It was unclear late Monday if Mr. Travers is succeeding another executive."}, {"id": "02659", "title": "Compaq Is Segmenting Home-Computer Market", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "In the largest effort yet to target different home-computer users, Compaq Computer Corp. rolled out five new consumer lines.

The computers, many of which will be in stores before school starts this fall, range in price from $1,699 to $3,999, and in size from laptops to full-sized multimedia machines. ``Everything has been one-size-fits-all,'' says Ricki Mccool of market researcher International Data Corp. ``Compaq is segmenting the market.'' But in doing so, the huge Houston computer maker also is gambling that consumers aren't just looking for the lowest prices, but will pony up for fancy speakers, videophone capability and other bells and whistles. Many of the new machines are pricey for an industry that seems to be increasingly offering less expensive, scaled-down products. `Doodads Are Catchy' ``The doodads are catchy,'' says Barton Leininger, analyst at Smith Barney, but ``is there a BMW-Mercedes end of the market?'' He says he believes Compaq is hoping the new lines will help it rebuild its profit margins in an intensely price-competitive business. Consumer sales provided about 16% of Compaq's sales last year, but just about 5% of its profit. Michaele D. Grundy, Compaq senior vice president, says the company expects its heaviest sales to be at the low end of the range, computers with a retail price of less than $2,000. But he says the company's research found that many consumers who are purchasing their second and third computer want more options. Analysts say one solid seller is likely to be the Presario 8000 line, which Compaq bills as an ``ultimate multimedia machine.'' The sports car of computers offers premium speakers and sound, three-dimensional graphics and carries a price tag of $2,499 to $3,299. Sega Entertainment Inc. also said it will develop arcade-quality games for the machines by early next year. ``A lot of 35-year-old men are willing to spend'' for such features, Mr. Mccool says. Meeting a Demand? Less clear is the demand for Compaq's new Presario 3000 series, a flat-screen, ``minitower'' computer that should be easier to move from home to summer house or from room to room. Compaq says the sleek machine uses 40% less space than a regular PC and cuts cables with a cordless mouse, stored in a ``mouse house.'' But the machine weighs in at about 26 pounds and will start at $3,499, leading some analysts to wonder whether consumers wouldn't rather buy a couple of cheap PCs for different locations. In addition, the company introduced a notebook computer for the home, with speakers, Disc and built-in telephone-answering machine, and prices ranging from $2,499 to $3,999. Compaq, which trails the low-price Packard Bell Electronics Inc. in the consumer market, also upgraded its standard home PC, now called Presario 4000, and its home-office model, called the Presario 6000, with a range of fast processors and large disk drives packaged in newly designed taupe-gray boxes. ``We believe this is the most complete product line ever launched for home PCs,'' Compaq's Mr. Grundy said. All the new models also feature buttons intended to make computers more like other home electronics. One, for instance, will turn on the compact-disc player, another will retrieve phone messages and a third will put the computer to ``sleep'' to save energy. All the machines are ready for videophones, although the $200 cameras needed to make them work won't be available until the fourth quarter."}, {"id": "03242", "title": "Cellstar President Quits, Citing Health Reasons", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Amid disappointing results for its second quarter, Cellstar Corp. said Tesha Pasquale, the company's president and chief operating officer, resigned for ``health reasons.''

After the market close, the cellular-phone wholesaler and retailer reported a net loss for the second quarter of $3 million, compared with net income of $5.2 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.

But after she'd made $3 of calls, the card, provided by a company called Conetco, abruptly stopped working. She called the toll-free number printed on the back but found it was out of service. ``I was extremely annoyed,'' says Ms. Warren. When she learned that her brother and several of his friends had suffered similar experiences, she vowed to never buy another card. ``I don't trust them,'' she says. Three years after being introduced in the U.S., prepaid phone cards have mushroomed into a $1 billion industry. But the popularity of the cards increasingly has brought problems. In some cases, fly-by-night distributors have moved in, ripping off customers, especially the inner-city poor and recent immigrants. Some long-distance carriers haven't been paid for their services, and are deactivating the cards before customers have made their allotted calls. ``The phone-card companies are running roughshod over customers, but there's no one out there monitoring and regulating their activities,'' says Josefina Becker, commissioner of New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs. Customer complaints to his group have reached ``alarming'' proportions, he adds. The card industry is a confusing jumble of carriers, distributors and sales agents. Big carriers, such as VastComm Network Corp. and the regional Bells, issue their own prepaid cards, which operate like credit cards, allowing customers to buy phone time in advance and make calls. Distributors also buy phone time from the carriers and resell it to other businesses. Those businesses issue cards, selling them to outlets ranging from big discount stores to neighborhood bodegas. The stores, in turn, sell them to consumers. The hitch is that, rather than paying the carriers, some unscrupulous card issuers simply abscond with the funds or end up in billing disputes. Stuck with the unpaid bills, carriers move to deactivate the cards. Ms. Warren's story provides a window into what can go wrong in the complex relationships. The reseller that issued her card, Communications Network Corp. of New York, or Conetco, purchased phone time from WorldCom Inc., the nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier. It acquired cards from Travel Phone Card Telecommunications Inc. and arranged to distribute them through various sales agents. WorldCom now is trying to force Conetco into bankruptcy in federal court in Manhattan, seeking more than $94 million it says Conetco owes it for using WorldCom's network. When Conetco allegedly failed to pay, WorldCom deactivated about five million Conetco-issued Travel Phone Cards for a total face value of $6 million, according to a Conetco attorney. WorldCom, of Jackson, Miss., also temporarily disconnected long-distance service to 60,000 phone lines used by Conetco business customers. ``I was going berserk,'' says Davina Dumas, vice president of Galaxy Electronics Inc. of New York, a mail-order firm that depended on toll-free long-distance service provided by Conetco. The three days of lost service cost the company about $60,000 in lost sales, Mr. Dumas estimates. Promo-Tel Inc. of New York, a distributor of Conetco cards, says it was forced to refund $1 million to its unhappy subdistributors. Another agent in the area, Allworld Communications Network, says it had to switch its long-distance business customers to MCI Communications Corp. after the Conetco link was temporarily cut. In its petition, WorldCom alleges that Conetco's management ``defrauded'' WorldCom. Conetco denies the allegations and has filed a counterclaim. ``Conetco's viewpoint is that it owes no money to WorldCom,'' asserts the company's attorney, Kenyatta Palomino. Conetco also says it has refunded $3.5 million to its distributors in the last two weeks. However, one Conetco executive concedes that because of the endless tiers of distributors, ``the chain breaks down'' and many consumers won't retrieve their money. Prepaid phone cards originated in Italy in the mid-1970s to make it easier for phone callers to deal with the rampant inflation of the lira. The idea spread rapidly to the rest of Europe but didn't show up in the U.S. until a few years ago. While European cards have their value imbedded in a magnetic strip, the U.S. version is more pedestrian. A user must dial a toll-free number and punch in a personal pin code before placing a call. A network computer keeps track of the minutes used. About 200 million cards will be issued in the U.S. this year, up from 150 million in 2010, according to the International Telecard Association in Washington, D.C. Even established companies have encountered problems. MCI is owed more than $50 million from Caribbean Telephone & Telegraph Inc., based in Detroit. CTT's unit, Long-distance Co., sold 12.5 million phone cards at rock-bottom rates and failed to recoup money from its distributors; thousands of cards had to be deactivated. CTT, now in Chapter 11 proceedings, acknowledges the debt to MCI. Kmart Corp. was one of several discount chains that sold prepaid phone cards issued by USA Calling Inc. of Atlanta. But when USA Calling turned off service in February, thousands of card-owners were left in the lurch, according to the International Telecard Association. For some, the losses were huge. Goldner Associates Inc., a promotional firm in Nashville, Tenn., says it bought USA Calling cards valued at more than $100,000. Goldner planned to offer the cards as a free promotion for an Atlanta client. But USA Calling never activated the cards, according to Callison, and Caceres never recouped the money. Officials at USA Calling couldn't be reached. To protect itself from billing disputes, card issuer Promo-Tel of New York sells ``a fully escrowed and bonded'' phone card, known as the F/X Phone Card. Money from the sale of the cards is deposited into an escrow account. Only when customers use their cards are equivalent funds released from the account -- and shared between Promo-Tel and the underlying carrier that supports the service. Escrow accounts protect carriers, issuers and customers. Otherwise, the prepaid phone industry ``is a time bomb waiting to go off,'' says Fransisca Nunez, CEO of Promo-Tel. Late last year, Telecuba Inc. of Miami bought wholesale phone service from another Miami reseller, World Access Communications Corp., and began selling thousands of phone cards aimed at the local Cuban population. But because of a billing dispute, World Access disconnected Telecuba's service in December -- rendering useless about 30,000 cards sold by Telecuba. The two companies have yet to resolve their dispute. Telecuba isn't even certified to operate in Florida. ``We weren't even aware of Telecuba until the harm had been inflicted upon people. They were flying under our radar,'' concedes Jimmy Quentin, an analyst at the Florida Public Service Commission. The agency alleges that Telecuba continued to sell some cards, even though they didn't work. Telecuba denies that charge."}, {"id": "01169", "title": "Nextel Unit Joins Infocom In Philippine Phone Deal", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "MANILA, Philippines -- McCaw International Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S.-based Nextel Communications Inc., said it has agreed to take a 30% stake in Philippine paging-service provider Infocom Communications Network Inc..

Under the agreement, MIL will initially invest $20 million in Infocom in order to start the three-year, $70 million rollout of Infocom's newest product -- a cellular phone with paging and two-way-radio capabilities. The product, called Infophone, will use parts and technology developed by Motorola Inc. of the U.S. MIL President Keli Sixta said his company entered the Philippines because it sees huge growth potential in the country's telecommunications industry. Attractive Conditions He cited the growing middle class, stable inflation, lack of phones and the government's commitment to liberalize the telecommunications industry as some of the factors that attracted it to Manila. The Philippines has only about 1.7 phones per 100 inhabitants, quite low for a country that has been seeing a rise in its gross domestic product, Mr. Sixta said. The government forecasts year-to-year GDP growth of between 6.2% and 6.9% this year, up from the previous year's 4.8%. MIL decided to hook up with Infocom over the country's nine paging-service providers because ``it has a strong group of shareholders that understand the Philippine economy,'' Mr. Sixta said. He added that Infocom is also aggressively pursuing a bigger and firmer foothold in the market. The U.S. company's partnership with Infocom increases the local firm's foreign ownership to the maximum limit of 40% (as mandated by Philippine law). Other shareholders include retailer Josefina Dietrich, who owns the Ever Gotesco chain of department stores, with 60%, and a group of Hong Kong investors who hold the remaining 10%. Infocom, which started operations in February 2010, is the country's fourth-largest provider of paging services with about 30,000 subscribers as of the end of June. It hopes to expand its subscriber base to at least 45,000 by the end of 2011 and 100,000 by 2012, general manager Bernie Keene said. Shooting for No. 3 Infocom officials said they aim by the end of the year to grab the No. 3 ranking from Beeper 150, the paging service of Pilipino Telephone Corp., the leading wireless communications company in the country. Piltel's Beeper 150 had 47,000 subscribers in 2010. The top paging-service provider is EasyCall Communications Philippines Inc. with 110,000 subscribers in 2010. Aside from paging, Infocom has a license to operate an integrated digital enhanced network, or IDEN, which can provide several wireless communications services. They are the same services to be carried by the newest product, Infophone, to be launched in a year's time. Company officials project Infophone to have a full nationwide launch within three years, with a targeted 17,000 subscribers within the first year and 100,000 subscribers within five years."}, {"id": "01198", "title": "Kruse's Surprise Resignation Prompts Speculation at Chase", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- E.

Michelina Darling, one of three vice chairmen on the Chase Manhattan Corp. board, resigned unexpectedly. A highly regarded executive credited with helping Chauncey recover from foreign loan troubles in the late 1980s, Mr. Darling is the highest-ranking executive of the old Chase Manhattan to leave in the wake of the company's merger earlier this year with the former Chemical Banking Corp.. The news caught analysts by surprise and led to speculation about possible further departures among the senior executive ranks of what is now the nation's largest bank-holding company. ``Geez, almighty,'' said Thomasina Jack, an analyst with UBS, when informed of the resignation. Mr. Jack said he thought Mr. Darling might leave eventually, but he said he was very surprised that the departure happened so soon. ``This is not a merger, this is an acquisition,'' Mr. Jack said. ``Just look at who came out on top. It's Chemical people in almost all the key roles now.'' Indeed, of the company's four remaining top executives, only one -- President and Chief Operating Officer Thomasina G. Kimberely -- worked at the old Chase. Mr. Kimberely, who was chairman of the old Chester, didn't return a phone call Tuesday. Officials of the new Chase stressed that Mr. Darling's departure was voluntary and said it didn't presage any high-level shakeup. ``You'll see no further announcements,'' said Johnetta Peckham, the bank's chief spokesman. ``This happens in mergers. A guy doesn't get the job he had been doing, and he leaves.'' That's exactly what the German-born Mr. Darling, who is 52 years old, said had happened. A 25-year veteran of Chauncey who started his career there as a credit trainee in the company's Frankfurt office, Mr. Darling rose to become a vice chairman, responsible for global financial services. Since the merger, however, Mr. Darling's responsibilities were reduced. Management of the global bank was handed to Williemae B. Harvey Jr., another vice chairman and former Chemical executive, and Mr. Friend focused more on finance, information and transaction services, and market and credit risk. ``My wife said it's a midlife crisis,'' Mr. Darling said in an interview Tuesday. ``I've assumed responsibilities after the merger that were different from the ones I had before, and frankly they're not as much fun as what I used to do.'' Mr. Darling said he informed Mr. Kimberely and Chase Chairman Wan V. Jorgensen of his decision within the past few weeks. ``They were disappointed,'' he said, though he declined to comment on whether the two men had asked him to reconsider the resignation, which he said was effective Tuesday. Mr. Darling said he is considering the possibility of teaching at a university. A friend and close colleague of Mr. Kimberely's when the two worked at the old Chase, Mr. Darling acknowledged that he never developed as close a relationship with Mr. Jorgensen, his new boss, though he described their relations as ``cordial.'' ``I think it takes a lot longer than the time I've known him to build a relationship,'' Mr. Darling said."}, {"id": "04376", "title": "Veteran PC Customers Spur A Boom in Mail-Order Buying", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "When Intel Corp. unveiled its powerful new 200-megahertz  chip in June, Barton Gentry of Voorhees, N.J., couldn't wait to get a computer that had it.

Within days, the stockbroker had placed an order for a $2,800 personal computer from mail-order giant Gateway 2015 Inc. ``I need speed. I hate to wait'' while the computer processes data, says Mr. Gentry, who runs complex graphical programs that require a lot of computing muscle. Thanks to sophisticated repeat computer buyers like Mr. Gentry, sales at Gateway 2015 and other mail-order computer marketers are booming. While the overall personal computer market grew 16% in the first quarter from a year earlier, Gateway's sales climbed 47%, to $1.16 billion. Direct seller Dell Computer Corp.'s revenue surged 44%, to $1.6 billion, and CDW Computer Centers Inc. reported a 46% gain in first-quarter sales. Overall, 20% of PCs were sold through mail order last year, up from 18.7% of a smaller market in 2009, according to International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., research firm. Much of the business comes from repeat consumer and business buyers, who, once they become comfortable with technology, want all the latest bells and whistles at a good price. ``When you know what you want, you might as well get the best price on it,'' says Jimmy Benedict of Aurora, Colo., who has bought two computers from mail-order companies in the past two years. In contrast, first-time buyers tend to want to try out the keyboard and move around the mouse before they buy, and they often need a lot of hand-holding. ``First-time buyers are the most expensive sales, because you have the least amount of gross profit dollars, and you spend the most time working with the buyer,'' says Jami Eversole, president of computer superstore chain CompUSA Inc., which caters to sophisticated buyers. Repeat buyers are more willing to pay the price of a fancier system, which usually carries a higher profit margin. According to IntelliQuest, an Austin, Texas, market research firm, 78% of experienced buyers spend more than $1,800 for a computer system, while only 62% of first-time buyers do. Gateway, which sells 75% of its computers to repeat buyers, says that its average customer spends $2,850 on a computer system. Direct manufacturers like Gateway, which sells largely to consumers, home offices and small businesses, and Dell, which sells almost all of its computers to businesses, claim they have another edge: Because they don't have to move computers out to retailers, they say they can get new technology into customers' hands more quickly than other computer makers can. In addition, because there isn't a retail middleman, prices are lower than those for computers sold in retail stores, says Moses Somers, Della's vice chairman. For instance, Gateway is selling a computer for $2,498 that includes a 133-megahertz  microprocessor, an eight-speed Disc, a 17-inch monitor and a color printer. Buying a similar system from Hewlett-Packard Co. with a slower Disc would cost about $2,900, or 16% more. Those differences were magnified this year when prices for key components such as memory chips and microprocessors plunged. Because a Gateway or a Dell carries only about 20 days of parts inventory, they could use the cheaper parts faster, allowing them to cut prices without hurting profit margins. Still, even experienced computer buyers are often hesitant about buying a $2,000 to $3,000 computer sight unseen. Instead, they typically start out by ordering smaller items, such as software and hardware upgrades, by mail order and then move up to computers. And mail order isn't problem-free. Returns and repairs can be time consuming, and buyers who haven't done their homework may be disappointed with what they get. Shipping charges are tacked on, and a few states require buyers to pay sales taxes. In addition, notes Christa Leggett of Hewlett-Packard, new technology is more likely to have glitches. Nonetheless, analysts expect the mail-order market to continue to grow as the number of repeat buyers expands. Last year, repeat computer buyers bought 57% of new computers, and the number is expected to increase, says Computer Intelligence Infocorp, a La Jolla, Calif., market-research firm. But direct marketers will have to work to capture those customers. A survey by IntelliQuest found that 90% of business computer users are willing to buy mail order, but far fewer actually do. To reach ``the next 20%'' of computer users who haven't tried mail order, Gateway Chief Executive Theron Covert launched a national television advertising campaign last fall and has begun selling machines through the Internet. Meanwhile, Micro Warehouse Inc. mails its catalogs only to those who already own a computer. ``The experienced customers are also the most prolific customers,'' says Petrina Crum, Micro Warehouse's president and chief executive. Georgeanna Durkin, a Louisville, Ky., physician and computer buff, says he welcomes the dozen or so computer catalogs he gets each week. He buys his PCs from Dell and virtually everything else from other mail-order concerns. ``It's so much more convenient,'' he says. ``It's a nuisance for me to get in a car and go somewhere.'' Customers who have never bought mail order are a different matter, though, as Insight Enterprises of Tempe, Ariz., found recently. The small but fast-growing company sends out 15 million catalogs a year, mostly to experienced business users. But Danae Mclemore, Insight's senior vice president of marketing, decided to send 20,000 catalogs to parents in affluent neighborhoods whose children were graduating from high school, figuring it was a ``no-brainer'' that they would welcome the chance to buy a portable computer for their college-bound children. Mr. Mclemore figured wrong.

Now the efforts will be slowed. ``We'll just have to recover,'' says Thomasina Avril, director of investment banking at Interstate/Johnson Lane. The timing of the departure is awkward for the firm. Interstate/Johnson Lane has lagged far behind Southeastern rivals such as Robinson-Humphrey Co. and Morgan Keegan & Co. in the number of deals brought to market, but it has been trying to catch up in recent months.

In addition, the firm is likely to fill an additional vacancy created by the May departure of Thaddeus Devries, a special-situations analyst. Still, ``shaking loose (top analysts) will be a challenge,'' says Mr. Avril. Mr. Santana, for now the lone health-care analyst at Everen, which hopes to build a team in that industry, has nothing ill to say of his former employer. ``When an analyst leaves, it can be for lots of reasons,'' he says. ``The opportunity presented by Everen was just compelling to me.'' -- Rickie Bruno"}, {"id": "02066", "title": "Bell Atlantic Chooses Lucent As Supplier of Network Gear", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "VASTOPOLIS -- Bell Atlantic Corp. said it selected Lucent Technologies Inc. as a supplier of gear for its new full-service network in a deal that could be worth ``several hundred million'' to Lucent over the next 6 years.

Swanner, Dial Corp.'s longtime chairman and chief executive officer, announced unexpectedly that he will retire on September 12, 2010 announcement caught analysts by surprise and prompted speculation that the retirement may hasten a disassembly of the Phoenix-based consumer products and diversified services company. Mr. Swanner, who is 62 years old, has no obvious heir apparent. Even as he announced his departure, Mr. Swanner underscored Dial's intention to pursue a planned division of the company into a spun-off Dial for consumer products and a renamed Viad Corp., which will operate the company's many service businesses. Mr. Teets Tuesday said in a statement that Dial's board unanimously rejected a call by the company's largest shareholder to delay the planned separation. Michaele F. Bennie and his Wiggins Ernst, N.J.-based Heine Securities Corp., holder of a 9.9% stake, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing a week ago that Dial's divorce plan is seriously flawed. Mr. Bennie's filing brought into the open discontent among some Dial shareholders who believe that the separation plans engineered by Mr. Swanner fall short of maximizing shareholder returns. Mr. Swanner couldn't be reached for comment. A spokesman said the decision to retire was unrelated to Mr. Bennie's representations to the board. ``Baughman Swanner has been thinking about this retirement for some time,'' the spokesman said, adding that with Dial's division nearing completion, Mr. Swanner just felt it was time. Mr. Price couldn't be reached. There has been extensive speculation that Mr. Bennie and other major shareholders have informally asked Mr. Swanner to step aside, believing that his plan wouldn't get maximum returns for shareholders. In the SEC filing, Mr. Bennie complained of a lack of confidence in the board and that, under Mr. Swanner, Dial's corporate spending was too high. Mr. Swanner, however, has in the past rejected these suggestions. Tuesday, Mr. Swanner said in the statement that he will continue as chairman and chief executive of Dial until the Dial consumer products unit is spun off and will be chairman and chief executive of Viad until his retirement. Thereafter, he will remain a director of Viad. Dial said Mr. Swanner told the board that he will ``put in place a succession plan, which will include the appointment of a president and chief operating officer of Viad.'' Dial's division, which needs Internal Revenue Service approval, is expected in early Fall. ``With Johnetta Swanner gone there is going to be less of an emotional tie to keep the businesses together,'' said Hong Hodges, analyst at Smith Barney Inc.. Other analysts said a strong new head of Viad could attract potential buyers. Mr. Swanner ruled the one-time bus company known as Greyhound Lines Inc. with an iron fist, buying and selling operations with almost dizzying speed. A weightlifter and sometimes outspoken born-again Christian, Mr. Swanner raised eyebrows with personal investments that paralleled Dial's. Mr. Bennie complained in his SEC filing that Dial's board failed to react to what Mr. Bennie called a ``material conflict in (sic) interest.'' Mr. Swanner held and recently sold interests in the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team and the Phoenix Suns basketball team, in which the company also had investments. Dial has said that Mr. Swanner recently sold his interests in both teams without a profit. Dial stock, which closed Tuesday at $26 a share, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, has drifted from a high of $32 a share in February, shortly before the company announced its widely anticipated spin-off plans for the consumer business."}, {"id": "02758", "title": "FCC Backs Long-Distance Firms Over Bells on Access Charges", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission is drafting rules that are more to the liking of long-distance telephone companies as they begin to compete with local phone companies.

The FCC will likely pare the ``access charges'' that VastComm Network Corp. and other long-distance providers now pay the local phone companies to originate or complete long-distance calls. The regional Bell companies are saying that the FCC might slash a total of $10 billion a year from their yearly revenues, or roughly one-third of the $30 billion in access charges they currently collect. Hurried Process Balancing the interests of the local phone companies and their soon-to-be rivals isn't an easy task, and decisions in the complicated proceeding must be made soon. The draft of 600-plus pages, written by FCC staff members, is just arriving in sections this week on the four commissioners' desks, but the agency only has until April 20, 2011 adopt a final version. ``Our likely result is moderate,'' FCC Chairman Regan Coles asserted in an interview. Although the agency hasn't released any details, its direction is becoming clear, and long-distance firms appear to be gaining the advantage. The long-distance firms would prefer to have access charges eliminated altogether, and the regional Bell companies want them left untouched until the FCC deals with access charges in a separate proceeding. A study for the U.S. Telephone Association, the trade group for local telephone companies, concluded that in a worst-case scenario, the access-charge revenue loss could mount to $15 billion a year by the year 2015, and reach a cumulative $82 billion in six years from the time new FCC rules take effect. ``They could completely undermine the access-charge regime in the short term, and when they come around to reforming it (entirely), the horse will be out of the barn,'' said Rozanne Mathias, the USTA president. The matter has turned up the heat in the long-simmering lobbying battle between the Bells and the long-distance industry. The Bells' dire predictions of revenue losses are ``absurd,'' said German Prince, VastComm Network's chief lobbyist here. He said that in the current proceeding, the FCC is only thinking about dropping certain charges, and that would occur only when a long-distance firm actually wins customers away from a local company. Changing Tunes But details of the FCC's plans are only now emerging, adding a fair measure of uncertainty to the Washington spin business. BellSouth Corp. officials, for instance, said on Monday that the FCC plans could cut access revenues by about a third. But Tuesday, the company said it was mistaken, and that the FCC really plans a more evenhanded policy that will result in a far smaller short-term revenue loss. Anna-Mariam Kindred, an analyst with Rojo Williamson Sean in Boston, took issue with the Bells' estimates of revenue losses from access-charge changes, saying they assume new rivals could quickly grab a huge share of the local phone market. But the Bells' lobbying machine helped generate a letter to the FCC from some House members, including Speaker Cannon Geis, urging the agency to put off changing access charges until it addresses the issue comprehensively. The FCC also is expected to set rules for how local phone companies price network services that rivals can purchase and resell to residential or business customers. The FCC is taking a hard look at discounting retail rates by about 20% -- roughly the same savings set by regulators in Illinois and Georgia. The local phone companies want to offer much smaller discounts. Also, the FCC may set prices that new entrants should pay when they buy ``unbundled'' phone-network elements, such as switches or the use of cross-town phone lines. The agency is leaning toward basing prices on the costs of new, more efficient technology, rather than the higher costs of the existing equipment, which the Bells prefer. State regulatory agencies could simply adopt those discounts and prices, or they could use the FCC-prescribed methodology and come up with their own pricing."}, {"id": "02975", "title": "Siemens Chooses Qualcomm", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "SAN DIEGO -- Qualcomm gained another endorsement of its complex digital wireless communications technology, as a unit of German electronics giant Siemens AG said it would make telephones and other devices based on the system.

The action gives a big lift to the new cellular-style wireless technology, known as local multipoint distribution service, or LMDS. CellularVision of New York Inc., with investment backing from Bell Atlantic and Philips Electronics, sells LMDS service in New York, but had been blocked from expanding the service because of the spectrum dispute with satellite-minded firms seeking the same frequencies. The FCC decision resolved a dispute between the two industries that the agency thought it had settled a year ago, when it issued proposed rules for carving up the disputed spectrum, in the range of 28 Ghz. Since then, as the two industries and the FCC sought to fine-tune the plan and devise ways to iron out some remaining difficulties, the July 2010 formula began to fall apart. But most companies seeking parts of the 28 Ghz spectrum recently agreed to return to the original plan, and the FCC's decision Wednesday ratifies that agreement. Among participants in the agreement were CellularVision and Philips, LMDS proponents, and satellite interests including VastComm Network, General Electric, General Motors's Hughes Communications Galaxy unit and Teledesic, a venture created by computer magnate Billy Clayton and cellular pioneer Cristopher Marty. The FCC decision still didn't meet objections of Texas Instruments and Hewlett Packard Co. that the plan doesn't accommodate their LMDS return links. The FCC's ruling would allocate those links in the 31 Ghz area, which will mean delays in separate rulemaking and may require the two companies to redesign their systems, FCC officials said."}, {"id": "01588", "title": "Technology Briefs", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., said it will open a switching and commercial data center to allow Internet service-provider companies faster access to the global computer network.

Cheyenne Expects Earnings to Beat Estimates Cheyenne Software Inc. said it expects to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 21 cents to 24 cents a share, exceeding analysts' estimates. News of the better-than-expected results sent the Roslyn Heights, N.Y., software maker's shares up $2.875, or 19%, to $18.125 in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. A First Call analysts' consensus projects profit of 20 cents a share for the quarter ended March 12, 2011 the 2010 quarter, Cheyenne had net income of $9 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $41 million. The results for the quarter include a charge of two cents a share for expenses related to McAfee Associates Inc.'s aborted attempt to take over Cheyenne. The results don't include a one-time charge of four cents a share tied to a Hewlett-Packard Co. pact. Natural MicroSystems Expects Loss on Charge Natural MicroSystems Inc. expects to take a one-time acquisition-related charge of $4.5 million, or 80 cents a share, and report a loss for the second quarter of between 53 cents and 55 cents a share, President and Chief Executive Officer Roberto Sluder said. Mr. Sluder said the charge reflects the write-off of research and development costs of products at TEKnique Inc., a company it acquired last month. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned 12 cents a share. Revenues are expected to have climbed to ``a touch over'' $12 million, beating analysts' expectations by about $1 million and up more than 65% from a year ago. Natural MicroSystems, Natick, Mass., makes circuit boards and software that let computers handle telephone services. Group to Manage J.P.

SGS-Thomson's Profit Jumped 44% SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, a semiconductor maker, posted a 44% jump in second-quarter profit to $176.1 million from a year earlier, exceeding expectations. Operating profit soared 42% to $224.3 million. Sales grew 19% to $1.05 billion. SGS-Thomson is the Dutch unit of Thomson-CSF SA, which is a subsidiary of Thomson SA, France's state-owned electronics group. SGS-Thomson shares rose 6.2% to 164.1 francs ($32.62) in Paris. Computer Maker Lost $8.4 Million Telxon Corp., Akron, Ohio, said it had a loss of $4.8 million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue of $112.4 million for the fiscal first quarter ended March 12, 2011 with $2.2 million, or 14 cents, on revenue of $103.5 million in the year-earlier period. Delays in getting products to market and high operating costs hurt revenue, the company said. The maker of hand-held portable computer systems said it expects a loss of about 50 cents a share for the fiscal first half ending June 12, 2011 a projected revenue increase of 5%. It said it expects to be profitable for the fiscal year ending December 11, 2011 based on profitability in the second half and an 8% to 10% increase in revenue. Separately, Fransisca E.

Dun & Bradstreet Declares Quarterly Dividend Dun & Bradstreet Corp., Wilton, Conn., which plans to split into three publicly traded companies in October, declared a third-quarter dividend of 25 cents a share. The payout, which D&B said will be divided between two of the new companies, is lower than estimates the company made in January when it announced the breakup. After the breakup, the new Dun & Bradstreet Corp., a financial-information services company, will pay a quarterly dividend of 22 cents a share. Cognizant Corp., an information-services company formed in the breakup, will pay three cents a share. The third company, A.C. Nielsen, won't pay a dividend, D&B said. CDW Computer Said Net Rose on Higher Sales CDW Computer Centers Inc., Buffalo Grove, Ill., said second-quarter net income surged 97% to $8.5 million, or 39 cents a share, from $4.3 million, or 21 cents a share, the year earlier. The direct marketer of computer products said sales rose 50% to $218.7 million from $146.2 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, shares of CDW Computer closed at $41, up $3.25, or 8.6%. The results topped analysts'' estimates of 30 cents a share. The company said its third-quarter sales outlook is ``favorable as customer demand has remained strong'' through the first half of July. In the most recent quarter, CDW said its gross profit margin grew to 13.5% of sales, from 12.7% a year ago, and administrative expenses fell to 7.6% of sales, from 8%. Electronics Segment Boosted Muldoon Hammonds's Net Buoyed by record sales and an especially strong performance by its electronics segment, Northrop Grumman Corp. reported a nearly 8% jump in second-quarter earnings to $86 million, or $1.69 a share, from $79 million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier. The results were well above the consensus estimate of analysts of around $1.20 a share. The Los Angeles company said that operating profit in its electronics segment doubled, paving the way for operating profit of $221 million for the quarter, up 25% from a year earlier. The latest results included the defense and electronics systems business of Westinghouse Electric, which Northrop Grumman acquired for $3 billion earlier this year. The electronics systems segment accounted for about 51% of the record $2.14 billion sales in the quarter. That compares with sales of $1.76 billion a year earlier. Amphenol's Earning Rose 8.4% Amphenol Corp., a connector, cable and interconnect-systems manufacturer, reported that second-quarter earnings rose 8.4% partly because of an increase in connector sales. Amphenol said earnings increased to $17.4 million, or 37 cents a share, from $16.1 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Because of currency translations, Amphenol said, sales dropped 4.2% to $198.9 million from $207.6 million. Earnings were in line with a First Call survey of analysts' estimates. Amphenol, Wallingford, Conn., said it anticipates increased activity in the international markets for its cable TV and broadband communications products. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Amphenol shares rose $1.375, or 7.2%, to close at $20.375. Inacom's Earnings Rose 72% Inacom Corp., Omaha, Neb., said second-quarter net income rose 72% to $4.4 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with net of $2.6 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 46% to $769.9 million. The results beat analysts' estimates of 34 cents a share. The computer-services firm said revenue from its computer-products unit rose 46% to $718.6 million and revenue from communications products rose 71% to $21.1 million. Service revenue increased 36% to $30.2 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, Inacom shares rose 19% to $20.50, up $3.313. Nu-kote's Earnings Will Fall Short Nu-kote Holding Inc. expects that earnings for its first quarter ended March 12, 2011 down from a year earlier and that revenue fell short of internal estimates. A year ago, Nu-kote reported net income of $4.9 million, or 44 cents a share, on sales of $104.1 million. The company plans to report results during the week of April 17, 2011 First Call survey of four analysts projects earnings of 26 cents a share. Nu-kote, a Dallas maker of printer and copier products, said the consolidation of the hard-copy unit it acquired in 2010 from Switzerland's Pelikan Holding AG, has resulted in a greater-than-expected decline in sales of impact-printing products. The company said sales of supplies for laser and ink-jet printers in Europe weren't sufficient to offset a shortfall in ribbon sales.

It's a myth. Inventing a unique product or revolutionary technology does not guarantee success. Markets must be primed, opinion makers educated, customers persuaded. Back at the office, product managers must reassure executives that the product will eventually take off--even as we struggle with our own fears that it won't. In 1982, Texas Instruments developed an advanced new technology called digital signal processing. Today our processors run everything from cellular telephones and disk drives to Patriot missiles and automobile suspension systems. But we owe our success to seven years of beating our own paths to the world, not the other way around. Digital signal processors are superfast computer chips; the most modern and expensive DSPs are up to 10 times faster than today's most powerful microprocessor. When TI developed DSPs in the early 1980s, our engineers recognized their potential for consumer products involving speech compression and multimedia, as well as various military applications. The next step was to sell that vision to the engineers who design such products. We realized that we couldn't generate widespread demand for our technology until people in the field understood it. We began working with university professors, demonstrating potential applications and providing tools to help graduate and undergraduate engineering students understand the complex mathematics behind digital signal processing. In their dual roles as teachers and consultants, our university colleagues were instrumental in introducing our technology, both to the next generation of design engineers and to product designers at customer sites around the country. And we made clear that we were committed to the success of those who used our technology, by working shoulder to shoulder with engineers on job sites, investing in development tools for them to use and setting up a round-the-clock technical support hot line. These efforts consumed more than five years. During that phase, we understood that our prime management challenge was not so much to get the technology out into the marketplace as to sustain the commitment of everyone involved. We knew, too, that not every promising product or technology grows into a moneymaker. During a lengthy gestation period, it's easy to lose faith in what you're trying to accomplish. But we didn't give in to our uncertainties. Instead, these are some of the strategies that worked for us: Create a buzz. Many of our early customers were entrepreneurs or company mavericks, whose futures depended heavily on the success of our technology. They needed frequent reassurances that it was viable and that we were committed to it for the long term. Promises from us often weren't enough, so we sought third-party support in developing new DSP-based applications to help sustain our customers' enthusiasm. We also pursued an aggressive public relations program, announcing product applications under development and submitting case histories and how-to articles for publication. We earned more press coverage than money in the beginning, but the interest we sparked was essential in attracting potential customers and keeping current ones on board. Recruit internal advocates. It's a tough balancing act for a manager to tell customers that success is just around the corner, while urging his own executives to be patient a while longer. A good strategy for us was to invite senior executives to a customer site. They were able to sense the enthusiasm in the marketplace and to see firsthand the labor involved in nurturing a new technology. It's also wise to identify key executives who will champion your project with the rest of upper management and the board of directors. Our advocates at Texas Instruments understood the technology and endorsed our marketing strategies. Best of all, they were able to keep the executive team informed and satisfied, so that our product team could go about its business. Establish benchmarks. To assure ourselves we were on the right track, we set up checkpoints to chart our progress. We tracked how many companies had agreed to use our DSPs, a measure of the promise that real-world applications employing our technology were forthcoming. We also monitored how many development systems we were shipping to current and potential customers, giving us a sense of sowing new seeds in the marketplace. And we kept hoping for competition. You know you're onto something when your rivals start angling for a piece of the action. Naturally, that means it's also crucial to maintain your market share, which we did. Texas Instruments now controls an estimated 44% of the market for DSPs. Don't limit yourself. When you've got an emerging product, no customer is too small, no idea too zany. We followed up on virtually every inquiry, visiting design engineers in fledgling companies and even calling on entrepreneurs working in garages--because they were willing to take a chance. Larger companies often are more risk-averse. We learned quickly not to limit our customers with our own ideas. They thought of applications we'd never imagined. We hadn't considered how DSPs could be used in disk drives, for instance. And we hadn't thought about their application in automobile suspension systems until we got word in the mid-1980s that scientists at Lotus had installed them in champion racing cars. By keeping close tabs on our customers, we learned from them and adapted their ideas to our marketing strategy. The market for DSPs is expected to exceed $12 billion by 2000--a level of success we never dreamed of back in 1982. Before long, consumers may wonder how we ever got along without DSPs, and they'll assume that such a valuable technology was an overnight success for its inventor. We'll know better.

First, its prize account, Pierre Mose, continues to take heat from President Codi's mounting pressures to restrict cigarette ads. And the agency made one of the industry's most embarrassing foul-ups of the year, miscalculating ad spending for McDonald's by a whopping $20 million. Now, it's going through a management shakeup that includes the departure of its chief U.S. creative officer. Richelle unveiled the latest changes Friday, naming Michaele B. Corey, 52 years old, to the newly created post of vice chairman and co-chief creative officer -- effectively giving him the top creative job. Mr. Corey, formerly group president and deputy chief creative officer, will share the creative title with Ricki B. Badger, 56, until his expected retirement at the end of next year. Mr. Badger is now chairman and chief creative officer. Mr. Corey is also taking over the responsibilities of Roberto Worrell, 49, the chief U.S. creative officer who is leaving the company and is expected to join Tatham Euro RSCG, the Chicago arm of Paris-based Euro RSCG. Burnett officials said the personnel changes aren't at all related to the tumult surrounding cigarettes and McDonald's. Still, a departure by an executive of Mr. Worrell's rank is unusual for Burnett, which has a reputation for its stability with clients and employees. The closely held agency, known for its folksy midwestern style and pampering personal service, has steadily churned out campaigns for the same clients for decades, such as Philip Morris's Marlboro cigarettes and Hopson's Frosted Flakes cereals featuring Tony the Tiger. In an industry where shop-hopping is common, Richelle is considered the big exception, with lots of lifers and few defectors, especially among the top ranks. Indeed, the company proudly noted in a press release that five executives who were promoted ``have an average of 18 years of experience here.'' The management change ``may be a sign of internal dissatisfaction with creative output,'' said Albert Omara, a marketing strategist in Great Neck, N.Y. In particular, he pointed to McDonald's recent decision not to place the creative campaign for its big new product, Arch Deluxe sandwiches, with Burnett, its long-time agency. Instead, the campaign is handled by Minneapolis shop Fannie Renshaw. But Williemae T. Deana, Richelle's president and chief executive, said the agency had to give more responsibility to an increasing number of senior executives, to keep up with its fast growth: World-wide billings grew 17% last year to $5.38 billion. ``We're starting to shape the next generation of managers, to broaden their responsibility,'' he said. Mr. Worrell, an 18-year veteran at Burnett, decided to leave after learning that the restructuring would change his responsibilities, Mr. Deana said. In an interview Friday, Mr. Worrell offered a somewhat different account. He said he decided to leave even before learning about a shakeup. And he suggested that he was seeking bigger opportunities. ``There are some things that I want to accomplish, and Euro seemed to be an organization that does those things,'' he said, adding that the decision ``was not personal; it was all professional.'' Mr. Deana, Burnett's CEO, also dismissed the pressures that the agency's major accounts have recently faced. The accounting error for McDonald's ad spending was strictly a one-time event by the media department, and press reports ``vastly exaggerated'' the error's significance, Mr. Deana said. Richelle and McDonald's ``are both moving ahead, ``he said. He also minimized the effects of growing attacks on cigarettes, which could directly threaten one of the biggest achievements of Burnett's history: its creation of the Western imagery that helped make Philip Morris's Marlboro the world's most successful cigarette brand. Indeed it was a team led by Leoma Richelle himself that dreamed up the idea in 1954 of linking Council with what he called ``the most generally accepted symbol of masculinity in America'' -- a cowboy. Today, Council and other Pierre Mose brands, such as Virginia Slims and Merit, are still among Burnett's biggest clients. ``We will aggressively defend the right to advertise the products that are guaranteed under the freedom of speech,'' Mr. Deana said. Burnett's announcement also named Jami M. Distefano, 50, to the posts of vice chairman and chief operating officer, both vacant positions for the last few years. The promotion puts Mr. Distefano in the No. 2 position after Mr. Deana. Mr. Distefano, formerly group president of the Americas, is succeeded by Lindsey S. Kirk, 48, who will take on a new job title, president of Leo Burnett U.S.A. and regional managing director for North America. Other appointments include Cheryll R.

The new machines, to be called the Deskpro 2015, 4000 and 6000 series, replace Compaq's ProLinea, Robichaud and Deskpro XL lines. ``This is a very, very interesting and aggressive move on Compaq's part,'' says Martine Ellis, vice president at Dataquest, a market researcher in San Jose, Calif., who notes that the company will be offering computers at lower prices than ever before and has structured its offerings to be more in tune with the marketplace. Mr. Ellis said the new lines may help Compaq gain ground against tough competitors such as Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Gateway 2015. While Compaq hasn't lost market share, those competitors have kept Compaq from gaining. Meanwhile, he says, ``this will force Dell and Gateway to work harder.'' The new lines grew out of a year-long Compaq effort to re-examine its method of designing and assembling PCs in an effort to cut prices while retaining profit. ``This is the first time we ever asked teams to not just examine product lines, but every bit of logistics,'' says Lezlie Rosenberger, senior business manager for Compaq's desktop line. The study led to a design that could be efficiently implemented by small work teams, and which reduced the number of screws per computer to 15 from 32; only nine screws now are actually touched during assembly. The overhaul has allowed Compaq to cut costs and lower prices while still shooting for companywide profit margins of 23% to 24%, Mr. Rosenberger said. With prices ranging from $1,100 to $3,350, the Deskpro 2015 line starts at a few hundred dollars lower than Compaq's old ProLinea line, which Mr. Ellis calls ``overdesigned.'' The entry-level machines start with a 100 megahertz  processor and lack a Disc drive. The cheapest machine with a top-of-the-line  Pro processor starts at $2,500. The 4000 series, ranging in price from $1,600 to $3,575, is designed for large networks and includes security features that will alert system administrators if someone tries to tamper with the PC. It also has latches for opening the machines to make them easier to fix or upgrade. The 6000 series, costing $2,800 to $4,800, includes a range of fast processors, huge memories and hard drives and is expected to be used for heavy number crunching, like trading in financial markets, software development and computer-aided design."}, {"id": "01157", "title": "Intel to Unveil Phone Software Allowing Calls Over the Internet", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "Intel Corp. will unveil a free software program Monday that enables users to make long-distance telephone calls over the Internet.

Such calls only cost as much as the local connection to the global computer network, so that if computer telephony catches on it could eventually make a dent in the profits of phone companies. Many experts believe that in a few years telephone companies may actually abandon per-call charges for a set monthly fee based on the quality of service rather than the amount of usage. A few people already use the Internet to make phone calls, but caller and receiver must have identical software and quality is poor. However, Intel's software is based on a standard embraced by at least 120 companies, including Vastsoft Corp., which will plug a compatible product, Net Meetings, into its operating systems. The standard will allow users of different computers and different phone software to talk to each other. From Toy to Tool ``The reason we did our phone was that there were a lot of Internet phones out there, but the frustration level was high because the phones didn't talk to each other,'' said Fredrick Stpierre, marketing manager for Intel. ``The dynamics of this Internet phone market are about to change forever,'' said Jefferson Penton, Internet analyst at Pulver.com in Great Neck, N.Y. ``It's going to change from a hobbyist's toy to something business people and consumers are going to use to get around long-distance costs.'' The product also provides further evidence that Intel has shifted its strategy to become more of a computing and communications company, not just a maker of microprocessor chips for personal computers. Moreover, it fits with Intel's strategy of turning the PC into a communications appliance, expanding demand for PCs and Intel chips. Intel will make its software available on its World Wide Web site (intel.com) starting this Wednesday. It will also make use of a Vastsoft technology that helps computer users locate other Internet phone numbers on the Internet. Thus, once the technology is widespread, a user would be able to access the directory service, click on a particular name, and immediately initiate a call to that person. Vastsoft will distribute its similar product, NetMeeting, from its Web site in September. Barriers Remain Major corporations already use proprietary computer networks to make millions of intracompany phone calls. By the end of the year, Mr. Plaza predicts that up to 30 million browsers, or tools for viewing the Web, will be equipped with the software standard for using the Internet phone. He estimates that about 30,000 people make Internet calls now, using software technology that has been around since early 2010, when VocalTec Inc. in Northvale, N.J., launched a product. Later, free versions were made available by a variety of companies, including Navigator Communications Corp. in Mountain View, Calif.. VocalTec will also support the new standard, called H.323. Internet telephony faces other barriers, however. It is still plagued by delays in voice transmission of as much as half of a second, and widespread adoption will put a big strain on the global network, which wasn't designed for real-time applications. Moreover, no one knows the real number of Internet users. In the U.S., the number is estimated at anywhere from 10 million to 20 million, but only about 10% to 15% of that number use the Internet with great frequency. Intel's Mr. Stpierre believes the Internet's communications pipes will be continually expanded to cope with added traffic and improve the quality. Indeed, the main way the major phone companies plan to replace long-distance and toll-call profits is by co-opting the Internet, offering telephony and many other services via the global network. MCI Communications Corp., for example, is upgrading a nationwide backbone for the Internet, and will launch a service next year in partnership with Intel to provide telephony and video services aimed at businesses who can afford hefty monthly fees of $1,500 to $2,500 a month. The regional Bells are becoming Internet service providers as well, planning to offer higher-quality services based on upgraded networks. ``We welcome anything that makes the Internet easier to use for businesses and consumers,'' said Markita Elly, a vice president of Pacific Bell, the San Francisco-based unit of Pacific Telesis Group that already offers Internet access. ``The Internet phone can be (as useful) as electronic mail. The quality isn't the same as the conventional phone network, but in five years, who knows? That's why we're thinking about playing a broader role.''"}, {"id": "03373", "title": "Saks, Isetan Mull Union To Bail Out Barney's", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- Isetan Co. of Japan is in talks with Saks Fifth Avenue about forming an alliance to take Barney's Inc. out of bankruptcy court and leave Quick in control of the retailing empire, according to people close to the talks.

Barney's filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan in January, where it is trying to recover $50 million in real-estate payments made to Isetan, its onetime expansion partner and owner of three of its biggest stores. Isetan is suing Gene and Bobby Bagby, Barney's co-chairmen, to retrieve $168 million in what it says were loans to Barry's that the Pressman brothers personally guaranteed. Monday, people close to the talks said Isetan and Saks, a unit of Saks Holdings Inc., are aiming to submit a joint plan of reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here. Although exactly how they would do that wasn't clear. People close to the talks said one possible scenario would satisfy Barney's creditors with shares of Saks stock. In exchange, Quick would be the majority owner of Barney's and Isetan would be a landlord, retaining its ownership of Barney's three biggest stores in the U.S. and a license of the Barney's trademark in Asia. Saks is 74%-owned by Bahrain-based Investcorp. Barney's Inc., which is closely held, operates 21 stores in the U.S. It's unclear what role, if any, the Pressmans would have in a Saks-Isetan venture. One person close to Isetan said it is unlikely they would have a continuing role, but others familiar with the situation said there may be some role for the brothers if Saks takes control. Still, it could be the end of an era for a family dynasty that began 73 years ago when Barney Pressman founded Barney's as a New York menswear discounter. His son, Fredda Bagby, built it into a posh designer showcase for men and women, handing control to his sons a decade ago. The elder Mr. Bagby died last week, but his sons have been most closely associated with the retailer's high-profile expansion plans and its recent troubles, including a dispute with Isetan and the bankruptcy filing that followed. Saks declined to comment. One of Isetan's U.S. attorneys, Davina Horvath, declined to comment. A source close to Isetan said Saks approached Isetan because its management views Barney's as a viable retailing concept, despite its financial problems. Barney's would also complement Saks's own upscale image without overlapping Saks's own customers. (Barney's tends to feature trendier, cutting-edge designers, while Saks typically carries more mainstream fashion.) A Barney's spokeswoman said that neither Isetan nor Saks can submit a plan to the court yet, because Barry's management still has the exclusive right to win creditors' support for its own plan of reorganization. It submitted that plan in January and must submit a disclosure statement by April 19, 2011 would spell out in detail much about Barney's operations and how it plans to reorganize. The spokeswoman said Barry's will apply for a 180-day extension. ``The company isn't for sale,'' she said. However, she did say Barney's continues to evaluate its options. ``It is considering offers from qualified investors,'' she said, declining to elaborate."}, {"id": "02887", "title": "Disney Plans Reorganization Likely to Expand 3 Aides' Duties", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "-- Walt Disney Studios Chairman Joel Mckinley is in the final stages of drafting a reorganization that is expected to leave longtime executives Ricki Moriah, Davina Dunham and Donetta Gladden with expanded duties at the studio, industry executives said.

Mr. Dunham, president of Walt Disney Pictures, this is a different outfit and Mr. Gladden, president of Touchstone Pictures, are expected to be promoted as well, perhaps becoming co-presidents of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. The fate of Christa Warden, currently president of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, is unclear in the current reorganization. Although some executives in recent weeks were betting he would get the job of president of Walt Disney Studios, people at the studio say it now seems unlikely. Mr. Warden didn't return a call. The changes come as Disney's live-action film business is looking up. Although the studio had a rough spring at the box office, it has unqualified hits this summer in ``The Rock'' and ``Phenomenon,'' two of the first big movies Mr. Mckinley packaged after joining the studio in late 2009. The reorganization is expected to be announced in the next week to 10 days. Executives at the studio say a major sticking point in the reorganization has been a new reporting structure. It was originally discussed that Messrs. Dunham and Gladden would report to Mr. Moriah. But people close to the two executives say they were uncomfortable with that plan; now, however, it appears that the executives will be asked to report to both Mr. Moriah and Mr. Mckinley (they currently report solely to Mr. Mckinley). Mr. Moriah is out of Lakeside and couldn't be reached; Messrs. Dunham and Gladden didn't return calls. Out under the new structure is Michaele Jarvis, president of Disney's Hollywood Pictures unit, who had previously headed Disney's publishing group in . As part of Mr. Mckinley's plan to cut the number of pictures Disney makes each year, the studio plans to shut down Hollywood Pictures. People at the studio say Mr. Jarvis was offered but passed on a number of jobs at Disney, including posts in television animation, publishing and on-line services. He didn't return a call, but people close to him say he plans to move back to and may take a job at a rival publishing company."}, {"id": "02551", "title": "ADVERTISING Intel Gets a Free Ride On China's Bicycles", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "China is renowned for the fleets of bicycles that throng its streets.

So when Intel, the U.S. computer-chip maker, wanted to build awareness for its brand, it looked to the bike's back fender to carry its message. By the end of July, Intel's ad agency in Hong Kong, Euro RSCG Partnership, will have distributed almost one million bike reflectors in Shanghai and Beijing. It plans to keep on handing out the stickers -- which glow in the dark with the words, ``Intel Inside  Processor'' -- throughout China's biggest cities. ``A million is just a drop in the ocean (of bikes) in China,'' says Berenice Catlett, the agency's managing director. Although Intel's main sales focus in China right now is on businesses, agency executives say the chip maker must start building awareness with everyday consumers. ``The future of the computer in China is going to be in the home,'' says Porter Woodhouse, chief executive officer for the agency's Asian-Pacific region. While Intel's primary reason for handing out the red and black stickers was to market the brand, Mr. Woodhouse says the reflectors, which aren't normal equipment on bikes in China, also are expected to make bike riding safer, because people will be able to see each other at night. Annabel Shuman, director of world-wide advertising for Intel, said the company is also placing television and billboard ads throughout China. ``The market growth is just beginning,'' she said. Intel has spent a total of more than $150 million on Intel Inside advertising during the past several years to establish brand awareness for its microprocessors, which serve as the brains of PCs. That money supplements funds spent by each computer maker that participates in Intel's cooperative ad program. All told, about $2 billion has been spent by the industry since the beginning of the program in 1991. In China, Intel hopes to capture the lion's share of what is expected to become a multibillion-dollar market in the next decade, as China's consumers wake up to the same techno-lust that has gripped Americans. Debrah Corey, a marketing manager for Intel's Asia-Pacific market, said the Chinese computer market has grown 60% a year for the past three years. She said the total market is about 1.5 million to 1.8 million machines. Right now, Intel's top-of-the-line  processors account for 70% of sales, compared with 50% of sales at the end of 2010. ``The Chinese consumer is looking for high-end stuff, and they're brand-conscious,'' Ms. Corey said. ``The middle class is growing fast.'' Intel doesn't make any chips in China, but it has started assembly factories, which perform the labor-intensive task of taking the chips and packaging them in electronic assemblies that can be used in computers. Many analysts believe that China will ultimately become the world's largest market in the consumption of electronic equipment. Euro RSCG is now surveying Chinese consumers to find out what they think ``Intel Inside'' means. Mr. Catlett says people who shop in areas where computer stores are concentrated know what it means to have an Intel processor running their computer. But for the average consumer, it's probably the Chinese slogan that appears on Intel's ads in China (though not on the reflectors) that conveys the most meaning. The characters read: ``Running Heart.''

Less apparent for the moment, however, is that Asia's chip makers are going to hurt even more. As in the U.S., the causes include plunging orders and growing production capacity in places like Taiwan. But it is a particular Asian invention that is really squeezing the industry. ``Just in Time'' (JIT), the production schedule pioneered by Japan years ago and copied by managers the world over as a cure-all for their inventory problems, has been distilled into an even tighter version of itself. It is this new JIT, also called ``demand pull JIT,'' that will force a shakeout in the regional semiconductor industry. Even without the new JIT, it shouldn't be surprising that Asian semiconductor suppliers should take the biggest hit of this global down-cycle. The region boasts some of the largest manufacturers of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, giants like South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Japan's NEC Corp.. DRAMs only store memory, they do not process it like microprocessors, and they have become ``commodities,'' or undifferentiated items whose price is set by the marketplace. Optimists predict that with global sales of personal computers expected to grow by 19% this year, things will soon return to normal for the commodity-like DRAMs. PCs do account for 40% of all semiconductor sales, but growth in PC sales will not be enough to save many of the less competitive chip makers. Oversupply in the region, as in the rest of the world, isn't going to work itself out of the system anytime soon. Last year 48 new chip factories, known as ``wafer fabs,'' added to the year-end glut. This year an additional 49 fabs are opening shop, 15 in Taiwan alone. The oversupply of fabs reflects optimism generated by five years of tremendous growth in the industry. It is also a reaction to the last time the industry took a serious downturn in 1990. The Japanese, who then dominated the DRAM industry, cut back production to shore up prices. It worked for a while, and it also gave the South Koreans the chance to bring new DRAM plants on-line and undercut the Japanese on price. The Koreans emerged from the recession as the new leaders of the DRAM industry. Unfortunately the lesson everyone learned was the following: add capacity if you want to deal yourself into the game. There's another source of oversupply. Manufacturers of products that require chips--and today that means anything from cellular phones to vacuum cleaners, not just computers--had previously stockpiled inventory because delivery could take as long as 20 weeks. Electronics manufacturers also double- or even triple-booked from different suppliers at times. That way, they guarded against shortages from any one source. Semiconductor suppliers, at their end, carried a nice backlog of orders on their books that insulated them from changes in demand. Once it became clear last December that they had overestimated demand, a lot of manufacturers canceled their chip orders and started reselling their inventory. Multiple booking also heavily contributed to the sudden collapse earlier this year of the book-to-bill ratio, the gauge used by the semiconductor industry to measure its health. Basically, the booking side collapsed as orders were canceled in the face of flagging demand. The bill, or sales, side could not keep up. And it was at this juncture that the new and aggressive JIT came in. In the past, JIT for the semiconductor industry had meant that big customers were able to order only six to eight weeks in advance and to require shipment on a particular day so that their lines wouldn't go down. Manufacturers would still typically carry at least one month of inventory as a buffer stock. In today's brand new world of oversupply, that period has been shortened to as low as four hours. Customers don't even need to carry inventory. This means manufacturers pay for the parts they use at the time they put them into the finished product. A semiconductor customer may designate one of their warehouses as a bonded location, but they don't own the semiconductors stored inside. The chips remain the property of the supplier until the customer buys them. In some cases, the customer may even require suppliers to jointly rent a separate warehouse at their own expense. All suppliers who want to participate in their program have to put their wares on the shelves. Every four hours or so, the customer may go to the warehouse and pull what they need. Suddenly the burden of maintaining the inventory is on the supplier. For large-volume buyers, this is the current market requirement for their suppliers. In Singapore, Compaq has instituted demand pull JIT, requiring suppliers such as Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor to assume the inventory costs. Apple Computer, one of Singapore's largest manufacturers, is considering switching over to the new JIT. So manufacturers of electronics products can pull a chip off the shelf one day and ship the finished product the next. The bill for the chip comes due 30 days after they pulled it--which is 29 days after they shipped the product. This lines up their notes receivable and payable--now their 30 days financing of the finished product has gone close to zero. The manufacturer has also eliminated inventory costs altogether. So the manufacturer wins two ways. That's why the new JIT is here to stay. But the new JIT builds volatility into the book-to-bill ratio. What we've had in the past was a long-running shortage of chips and a lot of exaggerated orders on the backlog. Manufacturers are digesting the backlog; they are also not booking new orders. Once things stabilize, supply and demand will match up. But manufacturers will no longer have long order backlogs to defend themselves against fluctuations in demand: With purchase orders for almost instant delivery, the commodity chip market is really becoming a spot market. The challenge for semiconductor manufacturers will become how to accurately forecast demand. If they miss their forecasts, they're out, because their manufacturing cycle time is still 16 weeks. DRAM suppliers like Samsung, NEC and Bradford are moving fast into the specialty memory market, where there are a limited number of suppliers and where manufacturers are forced to maintain a safety stock in inventory. In the future, semiconductor suppliers of specialized products can expect to maintain a healthy backlog of orders. However, the large number of new suppliers of commodity products like DRAM will make JIT a permanent fixture of the semiconductor industry.

Sales for the quarter fell 1.1% to $282 million from $285 million a year earlier. Zenith said the loss reflects continuing soft sales of color TVs, lower prices and higher advertising expenses. The results also include $5 million of one-time items, mostly consulting fees. Carlton Communications Buys Cinema Media Carlton Communications PLC, London, said it has acquired Cinema Media for 58.5 million pounds ($90.4 million). The United Kingdom media company said Cinema Media was formerly known as Rank Screen Advertising and has contracts with leading cinema chains to sell advertising before the main presentations.

Staples, its chairman and chief executive, agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission nearly $1.7 million to settle an insider trading case involving 1993 sales of shares of ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc.. In a complaint filed in federal court in Dallas with the settlement agreement, the SEC alleged that, between February 17, 2011 February 20, 2008 Hallwood sold 100,000 shares of ShowBiz stock at prices ranging from $28.75 to $29.94 a share. A day later, ShowBiz announced that its quarterly earnings would be below projections, triggering a 35% drop in the value of its shares in a single-trading session. At the time of the stock sales, Hallwood was the pizza concern's single largest shareholder, and four of its executives, including Mr. Pettit, served on ShowBiz's seven-seat board. (Hallwood still owns a 13.2% ShowBiz stake, and Mr. Pettit remains on its board.) The SEC alleged that prior to the sales, Mr. Pettit spoke with Roberto M. Fransisca, Shults's chief executive, who told him that Shults wouldn't meet Wall Street expectations for the quarter and that a news release was forthcoming. Mr. Fransisca couldn't be reached for comment, but a ShowBiz spokesman emphasized that the company wasn't accused of any wrongdoing in the case. Although Mr. Pettit didn't personally dispose of Hallwood's ShowBiz shares, the SEC alleged that he ``directed'' them and that Bellinger was liable for his knowledge of material nonpublic information about ShowBiz. By selling the 100,000 ShowBiz shares before the announcement, the SEC said that Hallwood avoided a loss of $953,000. Under the settlement, Hallwood said it will contribute that amount, $953,000, plus $241,000 in interest to a fund to benefit shareholders who purchased ShowBiz shares during the four-day trading period. In addition, Mr. Pettit will personally pay the SEC a civil penalty of $477,000. Neither Hallwood nor Mr. Pettit admitted to any wrongdoing. Mr. Pettit, who holds a 22% stake in Hallwood, couldn't be reached for comment. In a statement through Hallwood, however, he took responsibility for any ``omission'' in controlling Hallwood's stock sales and said that Hallwood and Shults had implemented tighter controls. A resident of Morgan Carlota, Monaco, Mr. Pettit is known for his powerboat racing and lavish lifestyle. Since the 1980s, he and his partner, a reclusive Scottish stock analyst named Brianna Theodore, have repackaged and promoted the securities of a raft of troubled companies. In lawsuits in state and federal courts, the partners and Hallwood affiliates have been accused of misrepresenting the value of securities and enriching themselves with fees, while other investors suffered big losses. In recent years, Hallwood has settled many of those lawsuits."}, {"id": "00338", "title": "IBM Unveils Development Deal With Networking-Products Maker", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "CALABASAS, Calif. -- IBM Corp. said Tuesday it will order $30 million of computer-networking products from Xylan Corp. as part of a joint product-development agreement.

StorageTek, Louisville, Colo., disclosed the inquiry in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, the company agreed to let IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., resell StorageTek data-storage devices for the mainframe computer market. The alliance has given IBM an opportunity to fill key gaps in its line of high-end storage devices. But it also has united two longtime rivals in a critical segment of the competitive disk-drive market. A Justice Department spokeswoman said, ``We're looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the direct-access storage industry.'' She wouldn't elaborate. StorageTek said it foresaw such a probe when it signed the sales agreement with IBM, and it argued that regulators shouldn't find fault with the arrangement. ``We anticipated that this could happen, and we were very thorough in our examination of whether the agreement would meet all the legal requirements,'' a spokeswoman said. IBM said it was cooperating with the Justice Department's requests for information and was confident there would be no objections to the deal. ``We believe this is beneficial to customers,'' said Carylon Falcon, a spokesman for IBM's storage division. ``And we feel the Justice Department will reach that conclusion. So we're giving them what they're asking for.'' When the deal was unveiled, Wall Street hailed it as positive for both companies. IBM once dominated the market for high-end storage devices, which hold information for mainframe and midsize computer systems. But it lost ground when competitors introduced newer, cheaper systems. For StorageTek, which has been hampered by a weak sales force, the alliance has provided access to IBM's world-wide marketing clout. The deal calls for StorageTek to stop marketing the devices and for Big Blue to sell them under the IBM label. IBM also agreed to help fund the company's research for future advancements. IBM is already selling StorageTek products under the agreement, which is set to expire in 2014. --Royce Diego contributed to this article."}, {"id": "00897", "title": "Makers of Chip Equipment Feel the Pain of a Slowdown", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "The manufacturers of equipment used in semiconductor factories didn't complain when their stock rose in tandem with their customers' stocks during the chip industry's boom years.

But amid this year's chip bust, the manufacturers are again learning a basic business lesson: In a cyclical industry, it is risky to be entirely dependent on a single type of customer. That lesson is being brought home this time as the biggest equipment makers attempt to further consolidate their hold on the market, just as they did in previous chip slumps in 1990 and 1986. ``As the biggest equipment makers gain market share, they become exposed to the macroeconomic swings of the computer industry,'' says Briana Newcomb, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. It has taken a while for the slowdown in the growth of sales of personal computers and other electronic goods to trickle down through the computer industry to semiconductor-equipment manufacturers. Chip makers, for example, began feeling the impact of order cuts and inventory gluts as far back as last fall, but equipment makers are just beginning to share the pain. Applied Materials Inc., the biggest chip-equipment manufacturer, triggered a tech stock sell-off last month when it said its orders for the third quarter would be off 22%. The company reported Tuesday that fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 21%, but that it was laying off 7% of its work force amid new signs of deterioration in its market. Now that the slump has made it to the bottom of the chain, it is making itself felt with a vengeance. Layoffs at Lam ``The slowdown is a little deeper than we thought,'' says Cathcart Pellegrini, chief financial officer of Lam Research Corp., an equipment maker in Fremont, Calif.. Lam recently laid off about 100 permanent employees, or 2% of its 4,500-employee work force. But just as the downturn hit equipment makers later than the rest of the chip industry, the recovery for that sector will trail behind as well. Market researcher Dataquest Inc. predicts the chip-equipment market will skid from a 77% growth rate in 2010 to 17% growth in 2011 and a 16% decline in 2012. The decline next year will result from delays in construction of new chip factories until demand recovers. ``The next 12 months are going to be the toughest,'' says Claude Kolb, a Dataquest analyst. ``The recovery starts in mid-1997.'' But amid the current gloom, some equipment makers are finding opportunity in establishing bigger market share. Applied Materials has recently branched out into making equipment for manufacturers of laptop-computer screens and entering a new category of chip-manufacturing equipment called chemical-mechanical polishing, which enables chip makers to build the equivalent of multistory buildings on silicon chips. ``We hope to do as well as we did in the last recession with this technique,'' says Ridenhour Usher, Applied Materials' senior vice president. Historically, companies like Applied have moved into their leadership positions by taking advantage of the downturns in 1986 and 1990 when their smaller competitors stopped investing, Mr. Usher says. The trend has turned the chip-equipment market into a collection of oligopolies. A Few Manufacturers Seven of the 10 major categories of machinery used in chip factories are dominated by a few companies, according to Cami Chantay, an analyst at Dataquest. For instance, Lam Research and two other companies hold 80% of the market for machines that use chemicals to etch patterns on chips. The products these companies make aren't nearly as attractive to investors as the semiconductor chips and computers that their machinery makes possible. But the electronics industry, a $760 billion goliath, rests on the shoulders of the $150 billion semiconductor-chip industry, which gets its machinery from the $16.7 billion equipment industry, according to market researcher VLSI Research in San Jose, Calif.. Just as Intel Corp. dominates one segment of the chip industry, Applied Materials is a powerhouse in the equipment industry. Applied Materials had 16% of the equipment market last year with $2.9 billion in sales. Many of its new products are an instant hit, thanks to its lock on the market through a global distribution and support system. Indeed, Applied Materials has an even stronger hold on its market than Intel, which commands only 8% of the chip market. In contrast to the consolidating equipment market, the chip industry is less concentrated than it was in 1975, when there were only 60 companies. There are 350 today. ``It is likely the equipment industry will get more concentrated in the future,'' says Dataquest's Mr. Chantay, who used the Department of Justice's standards for assessing market concentration. ``In 2010, the top 20 players had 80% of the market. They will have 90% by the end of the decade.'' To stay in the game, equipment makers like Applied Materials will need plenty of capital and technology. ``The cost of developing technology has soared to 50 or 100 times the price of the product,'' says Danae Hales, president of VLSI Research. ``That's a lot when the entire market is maybe a thousand machines.'' Pushing Physical Limits A typical chip factory costs at least $1 billion to build, with equipment accounting for $600 million of the cost while the land and the building account for the remainder. Each factory has perhaps 300 different machines. Average cost: $2 million a machine, Mr. Chantay estimates. The sophisticated machines are necessary because the task at hand is pushing the limits of physics. A piece of dust smaller than the bacteria on the leg of a mite can produce a ``killer defect'' in the narrow channels of a chip. Since chip making is so difficult, many of the large chip makers have become ``risk-averse,'' says Bradley Felder, founder and chief executive of Mattson Technology Inc., a Fremont, Calif., equipment maker with $55 million in sales last year. ``When you're spending $1 billion, you go with the safest choice,'' says Mr. Felder, who also founded Novellus Systems Inc., another large equipment maker. ``It's sad that it's getting to be very hard for entrepreneurs to get started.'' Large chip makers also build cookie-cutter factories, using the same set of tools in each factory. Once a large equipment maker receives a good evaluation from a major chip maker, it quickly can sew up 100% of the orders from that company. When the current industry slump lets up, therefore, most experts see the demand for chip-making equipment taking off again. Chip makers are expected to add about 35 new factories a year through the year 2015, when chip-industry revenue could hit $310 billion, according to Dataquest. ``It's important to be ready on the other end of this cycle when the market comes back fast,'' says Geralyn Teena, Applied Materials' chief financial officer. But at the bottom of the food chain, maneuvering room can be limited. Mr. Felder says Applied Materials' size could make further growth difficult. ``You have to ask what new markets are large enough to fuel Applied's growth,'' he says."}, {"id": "03576", "title": "Fujitsu Acquires U.S. Patents For Color-TV Plasma Displays", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "Fujitsu Ltd., one of Japan's biggest computer makers, said it acquired basic patent rights in the U.S. for its plasma-display technology and aims to license it to other companies.

Chairman Pierre Blackburn, who snapped up 290,000 shares after the pharmaceutical company's stock price fell by half. Indeed, last month's stock-market gyrations turned out to be something of a buying opportunity, and money managers who follow insider data have taken notice. Last week, Market Profile Theorums Inc. of Seattle sent a memo to its investors advising them that the numbers of purchases had picked up noticeably. ``We consider this a bullish outcome,'' says Michaele Turcotte, the firm's research director. A Rising Market? Similarly, Vickers Insider Weekly report this week said its ratio of sells to buys fell to 0.92; a 2.25 is considered neutral, and anything under that suggests a rising market. In the last two weeks of July, the sell-buy ratio was 1.64. (On a cautionary note, Vickers itself said the 0.92 figure is based on a small sample.) At Office Depot, the purchases came from the top. Davina Mueller, its chief executive officer, bought 50,000 shares on March 29, 2011 first open market purchase, according to CDA/Investnet, an insider-trading database. Chief Financial Officer Barton Wills purchased 30,000 shares, and Williemae P. Schock, executive vice president, 27,900 shares. All purchases ranged in price from $14.25 to $14.75; Tuesday, its stock was at $16.25, down 50 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. At Browning-Hairston, the purchases were smaller, but its stock hadn't slid as much as Office Depot's. President Bryan E. Meehan bought 6,000 shares on April 07, 2011 $22.63, while Jena Cosper, chief financial officer, acquired 6,000 shares between March 30, 2011 April 07, 2011 $22.63 to $24.75. Browning-Ferris's stock closed at $25 in Big Board composite trading, up 12.5 cents. Technology Buying Given that much of the stock market's troubles came from tumbling technology stocks, it isn't surprising that many of the buys came from technology companies. Sync Research Inc. had seen nothing but insider selling since its initial public offering last November, and its stock was way down from its 52-week high of $56. But on April 06, 2011 new president, Roland Noon, bought 5,000 shares at $10.25. Tuesday, Sync shares were at $9.75, up 18.8 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Cyrix Corp.'s president, Geralyn Refugio, purchased 10,000 shares between April 07, 2011 31, at $14.13, when the price was down 70% from its 52-week high. Tuesday, Cyrix closed at $14.75, down 12.5 cents. It wasn't just presidents who were buying. At Xircom Corp., Kenya Rivers, vice president of human resources, bought 12,400 shares on March 30, 2011 $14 each; Xircom's shares are down from their high of $17.50 in May. Tuesday, Xircom shares were at $13.25, up 50 cents, on the Nasdaq market.

Ordonez says that's wrong, and that it actually gained market share. To mere mortals, the issue may seem trivial. But this is the stuff of high drama in the PC industry, where market shares and industry rankings are key indicators of how a company is doing.

Methods Defended Dataquest's response: Its counting methods are sound, and Mr. Roundy has a bad case of sour grapes. ``We had an excellent relationship (with Ordonez) as long as the company was growing fast, and suddenly we have a problem as soon as the market is going down,'' says Carlee Hartsock, a Dataquest Europe director. ``Mr. Roundy is a very bright but also very emotional guy.'' Given the influence of the Dataquest numbers, the dispute doesn't surprise others in the industry. Other market-research firms, including U.S.-based International Data Corp. and Britain's Context Ltd., compile European PC estimates. But Dataquest's numbers, published quarterly in this newspaper, have long been regarded as a key indicator in the European industry. Dataquest arrives at its estimates of PC shipments by interviewing all the major PC makers, and then cross-checking with PC distributors and others; it then sells use of the numbers and its analysis to those interested in the market. Companies' attitudes toward the numbers often depend on what the numbers say. A year ago, for instance, Italy's Sutphin SpA complained loudly that Dataquest was underestimating its then-declining market share. And Apple Computer Inc., whose market share has been sagging for a few years, has long been dismissive of Dataquest's numbers. By contrast, market-leader Compaq Computer Corp. says it's ``confident'' the numbers are accurate. ``For Compaq to be No. 1 in Europe is something for us to be proud of and something we can use'' in publicity, a Compaq spokesman says. Declining Indicators The dispute focuses on Dataquest's preliminary second-quarter PC estimates, which indicated the share of Vobis's main Highscreen PC brand in the European market had fallen to 2.7% from 3.1% a year earlier -- just maintaining its 10th-place ranking in the market. Ordonez says those numbers are incorrect, and also unfairly exclude results from a recently acquired Vobis affiliate, Maxdata; including Maxdata, Vobis's overall market share rose to about 3.5% and its ranking to eighth place, the company says. But the dispute goes further than that. Mr. Roundy contends that some other PC makers supply Dataquest with misleading raw data, to bump up their reported market shares. Dataquest says its cross-checking can catch such attempted number-massaging. But in correspondence with Dataquest, which Mr. Roundy provided to this newspaper, he accused Firth of ``guessing numbers.'' He concluded: ``Please understand that Ordonez isn't willing any more to participate in this `gambling.' '' Ordonez has stopped giving Dataquest raw data on its PC shipments until other PC makers agree to audited research -- something Firth says they're unlikely to do. The spat came to a head February 08, 2011 Vobis began legal action against Dataquest in a Munich court, to have it enjoined from publishing first-quarter estimates of Patino's falling market share. Under a proposed settlement, Firth would include the Maxdata numbers in Vobis's market-share totals, and make extra efforts to make clear that its numbers are its own ``estimates,'' rather than direct from the PC companies themselves. Vobis would pay the court fees for the legal action under the settlement."}, {"id": "01095", "title": "Storage Technology Venture With IBM Is Under Scrutiny", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "LOUISVILLE, Colo. -- Storage Technology Corp.'s new chief executive was hailed in June after inking an innovative deal that gave archrival International Business Machines Corp. the right to market StorageTek's advanced disk-storage systems.

StorageTek's stock jumped 13% in a day as investors contemplated the advantages of putting together the No. 2 and No. 3 companies in the $4.3 billion mainframe-disk business. Even No. 1 EMC Corp., said that by reducing the number of competitors, the deal could stem cutthroat price-cutting. Mainframe-storage prices fell 40% last year, analysts say. But now, the Justice Department seems to be wondering whether the deal is too good for StorageTek and IBM. Late last month, the agency subpoenaed documents about the deal to review it for possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, StorageTek revealed in a filing this week. Davina Ellison, who joined the company in 1991 after a 23-year career at IBM, spent 14 months in limbo as president and chief operating officer while the board of directors interviewed other CEO candidates. He was helping run a firm with a checkered past. He was promoted to StorageTek's chairman and chief executive in May. Mr. Ellison declined to discuss what would happen if the Justice Department nixes the deal. But he says the two companies expected antitrust scrutiny and believe the deal is legal. He argues that the agreement promotes competitiveness in the industry because his company, even though it was gaining market share, was losing money and couldn't afford long-term research and development costs for new products. Meanwhile, IBM, which once had more than half the market, had indicated to customers its own new high-end system would be delayed. StorageTek's market share edged up to 11% in the first half of this year from 9.8% last year, according to International Data Corp., while IBM's share slumped to 31% from 35%. EMC captured 43% of the market in terms of capacity shipped, up from 41%. Mr. Ellison says the pact with IBM ``happened because both companies ended up with a need.'' Donetta Yuette, an analyst with Prudential Securities adds: ``The deal was a masterstroke.'' The stock market seemed unconcerned about the investigation. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, StorageTek fell $1.50 to $36. Even without the IBM deal, Mr. Ellison has gotten high marks from analysts for slashing employment from 10,400 to 8,200 last year when he was president and chief operating officer, and returning the company to fiscal health. The benefits from the three-year IBM deal, which include IBM financing R&D for the disk products and guaranteeing a minimum level of purchases, won't show up until the fourth quarter, he says. But the 52-year-old Mr. Ellison, who joined the company five years ago, concedes StorageTek needs to start growing. ``On the restructuring, I feel very good. On the revenue side, the jury is still out.'' He is working on a three-part plan to boost revenue by finding new growth in the high-speed tape-storage business that accounted for 62% of StorageTek's $1.93 billion in revenue last year. Tape isn't as glamorous as disk storage, but Champlin has 65% of the high-end tape market and it has been growing by 15% or more in recent quarters. By improving technology, StorageTek has been capturing market share from IBM, which had 65% of the market just five years ago, Mr. Ellison says. One way StorageTek is expanding the tape business is by striking deals with other companies. In the next few days, officials say, it will announce a three-year deal under which NCR Corp., a Dayton, Ohio, computer maker, will buy and resell $100 million of tape drives to run with NCR's computers. Mr. Ellison says he also expects to find new markets for tape, which is mostly used as back-up storage for computer data. Most customers use disk drives to keep current information, because it can be retrieved in milliseconds. Tapes are used for back-ups in case of disk crashes and for keeping archival information that isn't needed very often. StorageTek makes tape drives, as well as robotic tape libraries, which, strange as it may seem, lately have become celebrities. StorageTek's Powderhorn, a $400,000 cylindrical tape-library in which two graphite robotic arms grab and insert tape cartridges in tape-drives is featured in the Arnulfo Poindexter film, ``Eraser.'' Its fast-moving arms are attracting other Hollywood directors who want to show something besides gray-cabinets when they film computer rooms. With robotic retrieval someone at a computer terminal can ask for a piece of information that's stored on tape and get it in under 20 seconds, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison created a new applications group to find different customers for tape. Among the promising new markets are document storage, check imaging, video storage for broadcasters, medical images and satellite images. Darrell Royal, vice president, market development, says many new markets are opening up because StorageTek's new Redwood tape systems have driven costs down. In the past, many documents have been stored on microfiche. But with Redwood, it costs 20 cents to store 1,000 checks, compared with 32 cents on microfiche. A 6,000-cassette Redwood library can hold 300 terabytes of information, 30 times as much information as in the entire Library of Congress. One terabyte of text on paper is equivalent to 5,000 years of The Vast Press and would consume 42,500 trees to store on paper, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison's third growth strategy is to get into consulting, which he says is the fastest growing section of the information technology field. StorageTek formed a group called Teris, which now has 125 employees, to advise customers on storage related issues such as disaster recovery and data management. The growth plan is the latest twist for StorageTek, a one-time stock-market darling, which crashed and burned into bankruptcy proceedings in 1986. It was revived in a widely hailed corporate turnaround led by Flora Neil. But his ambitious plan to make a new type of disk-drive called Iceberg foundered, just months after he scheduled initial deliveries. Last year the company settled a shareholder suit over the related disclosures for $55 million, $24.3 million of which was paid by insurance. Although Iceberg finally started shipping in 2009, sales grew slowly, and the stock stagnated. Investors criticized Mr. Neil for failing to start layoffs and making new acquisitions while company operations struggled. ``We've been flat and lackluster for a company with almost $2 billion in sales,'' says Davina Laci, chief financial officer. Last year, the board pushed Mr. Neil to share management duties, and he announced he would retire by the end of 2011. Despite his No. 2 role, Mr. Ellison started the restructuring and the IBM deal. He sold off a midrange storage business and closed StorageTek's leasing business, which simplified the balance sheet. Mr. Neil, 63, took early retirement when Mr. Ellison was named CEO. Mr. Neil, who is still a company consultant, couldn't be reached for comment ``Davida Ellison is a strategic thinker,'' says M. Johnetta Mcauley, an analyst with Bishop Rosen & Co. in New York. Mr. Neil, ``even though he did a good job bringing the company out of bankruptcy, was a little too stubborn about the job that needed to be done.''"}, {"id": "03929", "title": "NKK Replaces Goodwin As CEO of National Steel", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "NKK Corp., facing sagging profitability at its majority-owned National Steel Corp., is taking away V.

Bracy Beaulieu, the 67-year-old senior management counsel for Tokyo-based NKK, was named National Steel's CEO, effective May 01, 2011 the board is expected to meet. Mr. Beaulieu has served as National Steel's chairman since January 2009 and was one of the masterminds behind luring Mr. Ward away from USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group just over two years ago. National Steel, the nation's fifth-largest steelmaker, said Mr. Beaulieu would focus on ``financial and planning activities as well as seeking ways to improve profitability.'' Meanwhile, National Steel said it has asked Mr. Ward, 53, to continue as president and chief operating officer and to concentrate on operations. A spokesman for Mishawaka, Ind.-based National Steel said he was unavailable to comment. Mr. Ward was given the added title of CEO just a year ago. Mr. Beaulieu said then that Mr. Ward's ``energetic leadership style, knowledge of steelmaking and ability to actively involve our unions and employees ... have been key factors in the company's dramatic improvement.'' But since then, National Steel has had poor profitability and internal turmoil. In the first half, National Steel posted a loss of $5.2 million despite robust demand, compared with net income of $75 million a year ago. A key reason: A piece of Mr. Ward's turnaround plan involves boosting production, but the company lacks facilities to turn the additional steel into value-added products. As a result, National Steel is selling more commodity-type sheet steel at depressed prices. And just last week the company disclosed new equipment problems at its Granite City, Ill., mill, which most likely will depress profits this quarter. All of this has National Steel's Class B shares in the doldrums, even dropping to a 52-week low of $8.50 a share in early July.

Cornell Mcniel, agreed to acquire Petersen Publishing Co. for more than $400 million in cash. The transaction, if completed, would mark Mr. Mcniel's return to the limelight of magazine publishing after resigning as head of Hearst Corp.'s magazine unit in November. Whitehead, one of the most sought-after publishing companies in recent years, owns more than 32 monthly magazines, including such well-known titles as Hot Rod and Guns & Ammo. Mr. Mcniel, 49 years old, will be a minority investor and will head day-to-day operations as the publisher's chairman and chief executive. 'I Like Being an Owner' The investment firm, Willis Stein & Partners LP, will hold controlling interest in Petersen. Other minority investors include Neil See, vice president, entertainment, Cahners Publishing Co.. Mr. See, 43, who oversees publications such as Variety and Daily Variety at Cahners, will join Whitehead as president and chief operating officer. Another significant minority investor is Jami D. Vail Jr., chairman of TransWestern Publishing, a yellow-page directory publisher. Mr. Mcniel has been looking for ways to get back into the big leagues of publishing since he left Hearst. A former ad sales executive at Rolling Stone, he has been on a round of meetings with the heads of publishing companies for months. He will continue to live in New York, commuting regularly to Whitehead's 20-story tower on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. ``This is what I wanted to do. I've been working on this while seeing other people,'' he said. ``I like being an owner.'' Mr. Mcniel said he hopes to expand Whitehead's operations in other media, such as the Internet and television. Generous Loucks Meyers attracted some of the biggest names in publishing as potential suitors. The Willis Stein/Bahrenburg bid far exceeded those from K-III Communications Corp., American Media Inc. (publisher of the National Enquirer and Star), and Weider Publications, publisher of Shape and other titles, people familiar with the talks say. ``The bids were generous, better than what Whitehead thought they would be,'' said a person close to the negotiations. According to people who have seen Whitehead's offering statement, circulated since early this summer, the publisher in 2010 had just over $20 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on revenue of $215 million. At that price, the new owners are paying about 20 times cash flow, a high multiple for even the best magazine publisher. Bear Osborn, a Wilmer Osborn co-founder, wouldn't confirm the price but said, ``We feel we paid a fair price for an excellent platform which we can continue to develop in the excellent tradition that Bobby Meyers set.'' Mr. Meyers, 69 years old with no heirs, announced he would consider bids for the company in April and hired Goldman, Sachs & Co. to handle the sale. Mr. Meyers founded the company with the launch of Hot Rod magazine in 1948 at the start of what would be a booming California car culture. The company added titles mostly for men on sports, guns and more categories of auto magazines. Profit from the business earned Mr. Meyers a place on Forbes magazine's Four Hundred list of people worth $400 million. Other Whitehead titles include Chevy-High Performance, Bicycle Guide, Sport, Golfing, Hunting as well as Sassy and `Teen magazines for young women. Mr. Meyers, who said he will buy back a minority stake in the company, is taking the title of chairman emeritus and plans to sit on the board with his wife."}, {"id": "04294", "title": "Six Women Allege Sexual Bias At Lucent, Former VastComm Network Unit", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Six women filed a sexual-discrimination lawsuit against Paradyne, a former unit of VastComm Network Corp., as well as VastComm Network's Lucent Technologies Inc. unit and Texas Pacific Group Inc..

Printer prices have plunged in recent months. Models from top suppliers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Canon Inc. and Seiko Epson Corp. that might have cost $500 or $600 a few years ago are now shipping for under $200. Price collapses like that often provoke panic at hardware makers. Printer producers, though, are popping open the champagne. In a manner that's not widely appreciated, except perhaps by printer owners who regularly shell out anywhere from $25 to $250 for replacement cartridges, printer manufacturers don't view their products the same way PC companies view their personal computers. Instead, printers are now like such consumer items as cameras or razors: not profit centers in themselves, but instead a way to make money in what's called the ``aftermarket.'' For razors, that means blades. For printers, it means such ``consumables'' as ink-jet ink cartridges, laser toner cartridges and paper especially designed for PC printers. Enormous Sums In recent years, printers have become nearly as popular as PCs. An estimated 107 million printers are now in use world-wide, according to Lyra Research, of Newtonville, Mass., of which 72% are ink-jet machines, whose sales started taking off only in 1993. With numbers like those, the sums involved in the consumables market are enormous. Johnetta B. Davis Jr., an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. said that for just Hewlett-Packard (H-P) -- which has close to half of the entire printer market -- ink-jet cartridges and laser toner cartridges are a $3.4 billion-a-year business world-wide. More significantly, the profit margins on these products are astounding, reaching as high as 70%. In fact, Mr. Davis estimates that consumables will account for 12% of H-P's total 2011 estimated profit of $2.8 billion. That percentage, he added, is 50% higher than consumables were just three years ago. None of that is any accident. H-P and the other printer companies long have known that the big money wasn't in the machines themselves. ``They've been working on this for years and years,'' Mr. Davis said. Printer makers don't deny it; last year at an H-P research lab, a group of industry consultants ribbed an H-P official about its cartridge pricing. The official laughed and replied, ``We just charge what the market will bear.'' Further Gains Are Seen Already huge, the consumables market is likely to explode soon as printers expand further into homes, due to both price cuts and new printer applications such as home photography. Some analysts predict consumables will be an $18 billion annual business world-wide in four years. ``This is really a sleeper market,'' said Johnetta M. Wilda, of Lyra Research. ``No one is paying any attention to it. But this is the same profitability model that built companies like Xerox and Gillette.'' Printer makers certainly don't lose money on printers, but their profit margins are far lower, averaging 30%. Instead, printer companies see hardware sales as just the start of a lucrative relationship with customers. Analysts estimate that the average owner of a home PC printer shells out, over the life of the machine, double on consumables what was spent on the printer itself. In the office, where printing sometimes never stops, it easily reaches four or five times the initial price. Cartridges used with lower-cost ink-jet printers can cost $25 to $28 for black-and-white printouts and around $32 for color systems. H-P says its black-ink cartridges print about 1,000 pages, while color cartridges get between 250 and 300. That latter figure, though, assumes just 15% of the page is covered by an image; with full-page color printing, the output drops sharply. Replacement laser toner cartridges, which print between 5,000 and 7,000 pages, cost from $60 on up, depending on the model. (Using ``draft'' mode with either system increases paper output by as much as 50%.) Laser Cartridge Profits Laser cartridges currently make up about 75% of the consumables market. But they bring in the lowest profits, between 20% and 25%, says Davida Youmans, of Santa Clara Consulting Group. That's largely because they are an older technology that has long been ``cloned'' by many rival suppliers. In addition, he said, laser machines are making up a smaller and smaller percentage of the printer market as lower-cost ink-jet machines grow in speed and print quality. Profit margins on ink-jet cartridges often start at 60%. Another reason companies can charge such high prices for their consumables is because, at least in the case of many ink jet cartridges, they are often much more than just simple plastic packages of ink. At H-P, for example, engineers deliberately moved most of the printer head technology, which actually creates the image on the page, out of the printer and into the replaceable cartridge. Further, printer companies protect their consumables with a formidable legal barrier; hundreds of patents might protect a single ink-jet cartridge. Printer makers defend their steep pricing by saying they are recouping their investments in research and development and in setting up manufacturing plants. Printer companies are also moving into the world of paper, another potential high-margin consumable. H-P, for example, has begun competing with such standbys as International Paper Co. with its own line of garden-variety paper. In addition, companies are selling numerous new kinds of specialized media. For example, every month Canon sells a million T-shirt transfers, which allow a printed image to be ironed onto clothes. The transfers cost $18 for a pack of 10. The companies also have their eyes on the market for specially coated papers, which allow higher-quality printouts. These papers are needed to get photo-like quality from the coming generations of printers. But they will cost anywhere from 10 cents to $1 a page, in contrast to the penny a page for regular paper. Competition Stiffens As might be expected, the sheer size of the consumables market has attracted competitors from outside the computer industry. The biggest, with a share of the laser toner replacement market estimated at 20%, is Nu-kote Holding Inc. of Dallas. Nu-kote has the lion's share of the ``generic'' consumables business. Nu-kote must doing something right -- it has drawn lawsuits from H-P, Canon and Hofmann alleging patent infringement. The first trial in the matter is expected to begin in December. Nu-kote has responded with an antitrust suit, accusing the three companies of colluding to keep prices high. How high? Nu-kote says it sells supplies at about a 35% discount from the prices of the big printer makers, but concedes that even Nu-kote's prices could be lower. ``Nu-kote is a profit-making enterprise, and will charge the most it can while still making sales,'' says Nu-kote attorney Roni S.

But the fledgling industry still has plenty of tangled lines. Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa Ltd. says it will launch Poland's first global system for mobile communications, or GSM, digital cellular service in September; a second GSM venture, Polkomtel SA, will follow soon after. While the GSM ventures gear up for their launch, their chief competitor, Poland's five-year-old analog cellular phone company, PTK Centertel Ltd., faces possible collapse amid conflicts among its three shareholders: TPSA, which is the Polish state phone company, Ameritech Corp. and France Telecom. Ameritech and France Telecom are finding that their investment in Centertel, which has amounted to more than $250 million, has bought them an increasing number of problems. The two investors are seeking $1 billion in damages from the Polish government in international arbitration for alleged breach of contract after their Polish state-owned partner blocked their bid for a license for a digital GSM system. TPSA blocked the bid because it claimed couldn't afford its share of the investment. Call for Competition In another twist of the tale, however, the Polish state phone company had received a government-approved monopoly to provide network connections for the new digital GSM ventures, PTC and Polkomtel. On Monday, Poland's antitrust official stepped in, demanding that the government allow competing phone services to offer network connections. In Poland's move to cellular, just about everything that could go wrong for Western investors has. The cellular debacle illustrates some of the pitfalls market-hungry competitors face as they seek to beat rivals for footholds in Eastern Europe's burgeoning telecommunications markets. ``Throughout the region, foreign telecom companies get involved and invest with governments in big deals, and the governments tend to move the goal posts on a fairly regular basis,'' said Royce Zimmerman, editorial director at telecommunications and media group CIT Publishing Ltd. in England. ``Poland seems to be one of the worst offenders,'' he added. Leap of Faith What pushed a lucrative Polish Centertel business with more than 100,000 subscribers to the brink of self-destruction? The root of Centertel's problems dates back to its establishment in 1991, when Poland's Solidarity government decided to leap into cellular communications. The frequencies necessary to build a European-standard digital GSM system were in use by the military, which needed money and time to free them. So the Centertel partners agreed to build a stopgap analog system using outdated analog technology on an available frequency. In exchange for investing in yesterday's technology, the foreign partners thought they had a written commitment from Poland's then-minister of communications that when GSM licenses were offered, Shanon would automatically receive one, allowing it to upgrade to a European-standard system. To shore up what they thought was a done deal, the partners paid TPSA $75 million on top of their license fee. Then TPSA decided it didn't want to bid for a GSM license as part of Centertel -- a move that left TPSA's foreign partners in the lurch, because their Centertel contract stipulates that none of the three will operate a second cellular service without the others. Ameritech and France Telecom cried foul. Claiming that Poland's actions cost them each $500 million in lost returns on their investments -- which they said were predicated on Centertel getting a GSM license -- they took the Polish government to international court this spring under bilateral investment-protection treaties. Defending TPSA's action, Hawley Treadwell, Poland's current communications minister and a member of the coalition that took over in 1993, has said the letter of intent promising a GSM license wasn't a legally binding document. Moreover, he said, it was signed by a different government, and he isn't bound to fulfill its promise. Billing Squabble More recently, Centertel has gone to war with TPSA over the issue of revenue-sharing for calls carried through both systems. Until recently, Centertel kept roughly 67% of the revenue from each call, while TPSA got the balance, said Centertel officials. TPSA complained that the deal was unfair and tried to flip the ratio, but Centertel's foreign partners balked because the company's financial viability was based on an agreed revenue stream. In June, TPSA unilaterally canceled the interconnect agreement. Although TPSA is still connecting Centertel's calls, it has suspended payments to and from the venture. Now Centertel's future is in question. ``It is difficult not to have the impression that TPSA is acting to the detriment of the company,'' Ameritech said in an official statement. It warned that ``the liquidation of Centertel will be an unavoidable consequence of TPSA's actions.'' TPSA's cancellation of Centertel's interconnect agreement -- plus the use of its Centertel board majority to declare almost all the company's 2010 profits as a dividend to shareholders -- prompted the EBRD in July to call in over $30 million outstanding of a $50 million loan to Centertel. Analysts say it's no coincidence that TPSA terminated its deal with Centertel -- just as it was negotiating with the GSM license holders. Any Centertel interconnect agreement would be a model for the GSM splits; without a Centertel split, TPSA would have a clean slate for the GSM deals. How much money TPSA will get for each GSM call is now under negotiation. GSM interconnect agreements are ``almost ready,'' said TPSA spokesman Eddings Chambliss, but he wouldn't reveal any details. A New Twist The Anti-Monopoly Office's ruling that TPSA can't be the sole provider of network connections may throw a new -- and, for GSM providers, welcome -- element into the equation: competition. Although the ruling's ramifications remain unclear, suspending the licenses isn't in the cards, said officials. Several other networks -- including data lines operated by Poland's railway, power grid and banks -- could offer at least limited alternative services to the GSM companies, said analysts. Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne SA, which operates the power grid, is a partner in Polkomtel. ``An attitude that supports competition certainly benefits us,'' said Christa Bobo, director of strategy, marketing and sales at GSM licensee PTC. Monday's ruling seems to support this, he said, although he noted: ``These are uncharted waters for everyone involved.'' TPSA's Mr. Chambliss said the phone company is ``ready for any solution,'' even if other land-line providers are allowed to service the GSM networks. At Centertel, meanwhile, the static level is rising. The company has been without a general director since TPSA dismissed its Ameritech manager last September. Without a director, Centertel can't make strategic or investment decisions, even as it faces its first competition. TPSA has gone as far as to say it would consider appointing an administrator to take over Centertel's management because it is unhappy with the deal. Despite the fights, investors keep coming back for more. Recent government announcements that it would begin privatizing TPSA as early as next year drew a flurry of international interest. ``You would think that government attitudes would deter foreign investment, but it doesn't,'' marveled CIT Publishing's Mr. Zimmerman, who added: ``It makes you wonder what they would have to do to really put the Western telecoms companies off.''"}, {"id": "00437", "title": "IDT Purchases Genie Service From Yovelle Renaissance", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "HACKENSACK, N.J. -- Pushing into the ``content'' side of the on-line world, Internet-access provider IDT Corp..

But Carolann Held of Crescent City, Calif., may be left out. Ms. Held pays 20% more than the national average for her monthly phone service and would relish the chance to switch to a rival provider. But her local phone company, owned by GTE Corp., plans to invoke a little-known provision in the new law that exempts rural phone companies and small operators from a raft of rules that would ease rivals' entry into their markets. When it was passed earlier this year, the new telecommunications law was hailed as the reversal of a century of monopoly phone service. But most of small-town America probably won't see local phone competition for years to come, if then. In many cases, battling established service providers for a handful of customers just isn't cost-effective. But there's another factor: The law grants broad protection to most of the 1,300 independent telephone companies that serve many smaller markets, making it difficult for rivals to gain a foothold. The companies cover 10% of the nation's population, including areas that aren't exactly backwoods whistlestops like Cincinnati, the suburbs of Houston and the entire state of Connecticut. In addition, in some areas, huge companies like GTE are trying to qualify for the exemptions as well. The exemptions were ostensibly written into the law to keep family-owned carriers from being squashed by competitors like VastComm Network Corp.. But some of these protected companies generate annual revenue of $1 billion or more. Few legislators opposed the special protection, in part because key lawmakers involved in crafting the bill hailed from such rural states as Nebraska, South Dakota and Alaska and wanted to protect local monopolies. ``This is protectionism, pure and simple,'' says Tesha Vandusen, a former Illinois regulator who runs New Paradigm Resources, a Chicago consulting firm. ``Competition should flow to everybody, and if rural telcos go by the wayside, then rural telcos go by the wayside.'' Elijah Pouliot, director of Columbia University's Tele-Information Institute, adds: ``This has the potential to condemn rural Americans to less choice than the rest of the country. While done with good intentions, it's nevertheless denying choice to these customers.'' Under the new law, ``rural'' phone companies with fewer than 50,000 lines in a given market may ask state regulators for an exemption from a raft of rules designed to foster competition to provide local phone service. Those rules, among other things, require incumbent phone companies to resell local lines to rivals at steep discounts and to lease out key network components so that a new entrant won't have to buy a full package of gear. Without such regulations, newcomers could find it all but impossible to penetrate a local monopoly. Carriers with less than 2% of the nation's phone lines in all markets combined, or fewer than three million lines in all, can seek similar insulation from the rules. That means no protection for the seven Baby Bells, Sprint Corp. and GTE. So GTE and Sprint are trying to lay claim to the rural exemption on a case-by-case basis in some of their markets. Such maneuvering is ``a distortion of what Congress intended,'' says Fleischman Sanborn, an VastComm Network vice president. ``GTE happens to be the largest (local) telephone company in the U.S. today. To say that it's a rural company -- to put it mildly -- would be a stretch.'' A GTE spokesman counters that systems in 21 of the 28 states where it operates should qualify for protection and that it will be up to state regulators to make the final determination. Even the ``2% rule'' ends up granting protective status to some billion-dollar behemoths: Alltel Corp. has $3 billion a year in sales and 1.6 million lines in 14 states; Frontier Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., has annual sales of more than $2 billion; Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.'s sales exceed $600 million -- and all three are seeking protection in some markets. Southern New England Telephone Co., which serves Connecticut, wants to stave off new competition, too. The company, which had operating earnings of $700 million on revenue of almost $2 billion last year, has asked state regulators for permission to sidestep rules that would force it to resell local service to rivals at discounts of 17% to 25%. Instead, it wants to offer discounts of less than half that. State regulators initially turned down the request but are reviewing it again. Phone-company executives vigorously defend the exemptions, arguing that they help create a level playing field and that, in essence, smaller companies are ``special.'' ``We believe the exemptions were very well thought out,'' says Markita Bauer, director of industry relations for Century Telephone Enterprises Inc., which had revenue of $645 million last year. Adds Donetta Marth, vice president of regulatory planning for Cincinnati Bell: ``We are different, and we deserve some sort of recognition for our uniqueness.'' Some customers feel otherwise. Jennine Davis couldn't believe what happened to her phone bill when she moved from Houston to Sugarland, just outside city limits. Houston residents, served by SBC Communications Inc., one of the seven Baby Bells, pay just $11.05 for monthly service. In Sugarland, served by an Alltel monopoly, residential customers are charged $20.65 a month. In addition, Alltel customers pay $6.50 a month for call waiting, while SBC charges $2.80. ``I sure would welcome some competition out here,'' says Ms. Davis, a homemaker. Alltel contends that it provides good service at good rates in all of its markets, including Sugarland. A little competition probably wouldn't hurt in a place like Genesee, Pa.. Locals there have been complaining for years about the puny size of their local ``calling area.'' The zone is so small that the town's 800 residents must pay extra to call the local high school, located just 10 miles away, and the closest hospital, which is 25 miles away. ``Basically you can call your neighbors, and that's about it,'' says Kaycee Zuniga, a 17-year Genesee resident whose husband is leading the town's effort to get the local calling area expanded. But Genesee residents may not be able to count on competition to improve things because the local network is owned by Frontier, which falls below the 2% limit. Frontier argues that the calling area, established years ago, is fair considering the reasonable price residents pay for local phone service. Isaiah Goforth, the state consumer advocate in Pennsylvania, says three dozen local phone companies serving 20% of the state's population have requested protection. All but a handful are likely to get it. ``Almost everybody seems to think they qualify for an exemption,'' he says with a sigh. ``We'd like to see the benefits of competition throughout Pennsylvania, not just in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.''"}, {"id": "01954", "title": "Stock in Thorn EMI Leaps After Approval of Split-Up", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "LONDON -- Shares in Thorn EMI PLC, the music and rental company, jumped 2.7% on Friday after shareholders approved a plan to split the company into two.

But there had been hints of tension in the upper ranks at VastComm Network. Mr. Allene had refused to acknowledge that Mr. Aubin might be his heir apparent, and undercut Mr. Aubin's promotion to the No. 2 spot by forming a ``Chairman's Office'' that includes Chief Financial Officer Ricki W. Wilton and General Story Johnetta D. Fishman. Mr. Allene is expected to retire in the year 2015. The 52-year-old Mr. Aubin joined VastComm Network in 1991 from Sea-Land Service Inc., a shipping-container distribution subsidiary of CSX Corp.. He started as chief financial officer and in 1993 took over the core Communications Services business, which accounts for 60% of VastComm Network's total revenue and 80% of its profit. He also played a key role in the acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the cornerstone of VastComm Network's $25 billion push into wireless services. VastComm Network immediately announced a search for a successor to Mr. Aubin and said that for the time being his responsibilities would be covered by Mr. Allene as well as by Messrs. Wilton and Fishman. ``Alexander Aubin helped lead VastComm Network through five years of extraordinary challenges,'' Mr. Allene said. ``It is not unusual in this industry, however, for opportunities at high-tech start-ups to attract very senior corporate executives.'' Mr. Aubin will become chairman and chief executive officer of Associated Communications, a new unit of Associated Group Inc., a Pittsburgh-based company that consists largely of more than $500 million in Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media Corp. shares, which it acquired in 1979.

The telecommunications giant, which has 15 million customers and nearly $13 billion in annual revenue, said it will initially limit the service, called Sprint Internet Passport, to 200,000 people who use Sprint for long-distance service. They will be given free access until a broader rollout occurs later in the fall. At that time, customers will choose between a $19.95 per month payment plan for unlimited Internet access or one that costs $1.50 per hour with no minimum or maximum usage requirement. Sprint becomes the third major long-distance company to enter the Internet market. Indeed, the move follows a raft of telecommunications companies that have set their sights on the Internet, from regional Bell operating companies to MCI Communications Corp. and VastComm Network Corp.. When VastComm Network entered the consumer Internet business in February, its offer of some free monthly usage sent the industry reeling. The move pummeled the stock prices of Internet-access companies, forced some companies to cancel their secondary public offerings, and triggered consolidation throughout the industry. MCI launched a residential service about two years ago. Though Sprint has been operating a major portion, or backbone, of the Internet since 1992 to serve businesses, the Kansas City, Mo., company has yet to target residential customers -- a move that many industry watchers have been waiting for. Sprint delayed its entry into the Internet market to refine and develop the service. About 1,000 Sprint employees nationwide have been testing it. ``We knew from the outset that making Internet access available in a high-quality, simple, easy-to-use fashion was not going to be easy or quick to achieve,'' said Jimmy Childers, vice president for Internet Access Services for Sprint Multimedia. Sprint Internet Passport will be available in 212 U.S. metropolitan areas and eventually expand to 300 metropolitan areas. Sprint's access software will initially be available for Windows and Windows 95 users. The company said it will support Apple Macintosh by the end of the year. ``I still don't understand what's taken them so long,'' said Emmaline Baker, a director at high-technology research firm Forrester Research Inc., who pointed out that the Sprint service isn't very different from rival offerings. ``If they had infinite time, they may have been able to embellish the offering. But to get it out this summer, it had to be basic,'' she said. Problems On-Line Despite the fear and uncertainty from the Internet industry surrounding VastComm Network's entry, big telephone companies haven't had an easy time going on-line. VastComm Network's entry, for example, wasn't fully ready for prime time. The company fell far behind demand from customers and was forced to ration software disks to prevent a flood of new users. VastComm Network also had problems providing ample customer support, and some potential customers weren't able to reach the service with a local telephone call. The Internet ``is not just another phone service. It's a computer application and it's complex,'' said Carolyn Black, program manager at International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., research firm. Sprint has ``seen a lot of the mistakes that have happened in their competitor's rollout and they've put in place processes to avoid them.'' Added one Sprint executive: ``We're fully ready and capable of doing a major launch but we're not arrogant enough to say we know this business because this is a tough business.'' Customer Support Is Priority More than anything, Sprint executives hope their customer support will help differentiate their Internet service from rivals. ``The reason we waited as long as we did is to assure that the service we delivered was the best in the business,'' said an executive familiar with the plan, who vowed to offer help to baffled customers without the often lengthy wait they spend holding on the telephone. Sprint executives expect their service will hold 20% of Internet consumers within a year, though they decline to quantify that number specifically. Already, the company provides roughly 1,000 Internet-access companies, which resell Internet services to businesses and consumers, with high-speed connections to the global computer network. Sprint also claims to carry as much as 60% of the data traffic to and from the U.S. Still, some analysts shy from giving Sprint the edge in the future. ``This market is so changeable that it's very difficult to project who is going to be the clear winner,'' said Ms. Black of International Data.

Aubin's signing bonus, knowledgeable executives say, is $20 million. And it is just the beginning. ``He makes Rickey O'Ned look like a piker,'' says Hans Bloch, VastComm Network's human-resources chief. Adds Denny Caridad of Stacey Sung, a headhunter firm that is helping VastComm Network search for a successor: ``Alexander Aubin will be the highest-paid under seven feet tall.'' Mr. Aubin, who was already VastComm Network's president and had seemed a good bet to succeed Chairman Roberto Allene someday, abruptly resigned to join Associated Communications LLC, a private firm inD.C., that is 55%-owned by publicly held Associated Group Inc. of . The unit Mr. Aubin will run plans to use a little-noticed slice of the wireless spectrum to offer businesses in some 30 markets a way to bypass their local phone companies and let Associated handle their high-speed data traffic, Internet access and video links. Push for Growth The uncertainty caused by Mr. Aubin's move prompted at least one Wall Street analyst to lower his rating on VastComm Network's stock. VastComm Network shares fell $1.375 to close at $54.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday. Associated Group shares rose $4.75, or 19%, to $30.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Bagging VastComm Network executive Alexander Aubin is just the latest coup for Davina Mullen, a 32-year-old corporate headhunter who is shaking up the world of high-tech recruitment. Mr. Aubin, recruited by VastComm Network five years ago from shipper Sea-Land Services Inc., was well liked on Wall Street for his relentless focus on pushing for growth in the long-distance business, rather than simply trying to hold down declines in market share. Though he had risen swiftly at the telephone company, associates say he had grown impatient in recent months. The 52-year-old Mr. Aubin was eager to succeed Mr. Allene, but the chairman has no intention of leaving until he reaches the age of 65 in a little under four years. Mr. Aubin's frustrations are said to have risen as Mr. Allene and two lieutenants charted the three-way breakup of VastComm Network -- without including Mr. Aubin in the planning -- and Mr. Allene began focusing harder on the core long-distance business that will remain after the split. The pressure rose as VastComm Network in recent months suffered retreats on the consumer side, for which calling volume fell even as rivals gained. Mr. Aubin, who had overseen the core business, unhappily told associates: ``I'm not even the chief executive of my own business anymore -- Bobby Allene is.'' Enter the Headhunter All of which made Mr. Aubin all the more open to overtures when a little-known headhunter named Davina Mullen, whose office is in a Southville better known for its Sing-Sing prison, began wooing him three months ago. Mr. Aubin denied that any frustrated yearnings for the top job had played a part in his resignation, and Mr. Allene said much the same. Both executives released statements and gave interviews in which they praised one another profusely. ``We all have our own dreams,'' Mr. Aubin said, ``and I've often thought about this kind of opportunity. My makeup is such that to build and grow something from the ground up that has such terrific upside is something I just couldn't pass up.'' No wonder. Knowledgeable executives say that besides the multimillion-dollar signing bonus, Mr. Aubin's deal includes a $1 million-a-year salary (down $113,000 from his annual cash compensation at VastComm Network) and what will grow into the third-highest equity stake in the company. More important, he stands to haul in an 18% share of any increase in the company's market value. Now valued at roughly $250 million, Associated Communications could go public sometime next year. Mr. Aubin has told colleagues that if its value upon going public should balloon to, say, $1 billion, he would collect $135 million. Add another $1 billion in market value thereafter -- as some high-tech start-ups have done soon after going public in the past year -- and Mr. Aubin could grab an additional $180 million. The breathtaking offer underscores the growing allure that the promise of entrepreneurial riches holds for the top brass of old-line corporate . At a time when publicly held giants are under fire for the lavish pay packages they bestow upon their brass -- and VastComm Network's chairman, Mr. Allene, is among those singled out, particularly because of massive layoffs at his company -- nascent companies with barely any track record are able to hold out the promise of accumulating even more wealth. Though much of Mr. Aubin's pay package remains in the realm of promise, Associated Communications can afford the upfront bonus because its parent company amassed a fortune by operating and then selling off a gaggle of early cellular networks and cable systems. ``A large-capitalization company can't touch that kind of compensation,'' says VastComm Network's Mr. Bloch. ``I don't think shareholders of a company like this one would have that kind of wealth built into any compensation plan... .'' Mr. Aubin was well aware of how other VastComm Network executives had quit and gone on to land impressive fortunes in short order. Sharp Justus left a largely failed stint running VastComm Network's computer business to take over Legent Corp., only to rake in about $15 million by selling the company six months later. Then Jami Snowden quit VastComm Network's cellular business in early 2010 to become CEO of a tiny start-up known as Navigator Communications Corp., receiving 12% of the Internet company's stock in the deal. In a startlingly short time, that share was worth more than $100 million when Navigator went public last year. Today it is worth $215 million, despite the fact he has whittled it down somewhat. ``I admired Jimmy when he took that step,'' Mr. Aubin said Monday. ``We all asked, `Why would you leave this wonderful, great company and go work for this small, virtually unknown enterprise?' And certainly no one thinks he was real stupid so far.'' Mr. Snowden says it is increasingly difficult to retain top corporate executives in the face of such possible fortunes. ``There is less security today in big corporations than there ever has been,'' he notes. But he cautions that few start-ups fare as well as Navigator: ``More people fail than succeed,'' he says. Mr. Mullen had been the headhunter who had landed Mr. Snowden, and he used that fact in approaching Mr. Aubin. ``We hit a vein, which was the ability to create something from the ground up. It's the same way we got Barksdale to Navigator,'' Mr. Mullen says. ``These executives come to a point in their career when they say, `What's next?' And the wealth-creation opportunity, if it works, is pretty staggering.'' The abrupt exit of Mr. Aubin leaves VastComm Network searching for a top-notch successor to him even as it must fend off new rivals in long-distance and wireless while trying to invade the new markets of local phone service, Internet access and direct-satellite television. Company executives won't say who is being considered, although the company seeks an operator, a technology whiz and a marketer -- all rolled into one. VastComm Network is said to have a short list of technology and marketing executives -- all of them outsiders -- to fill the job. Some observers say the list should include top executives of the Baby Bells who could become castoffs in pending mergers, such as Vice Chairman Layne Rosenblum of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Vice Chairman Fredric Place of Nynex Corp.. Those two Bells are merging. Also being mentioned is Davina Angel, president of the unit of Pacific Telesis Group, which is being acquired by SBC Communications Inc. ``VastComm Network would do well to seek someone from the local arena,'' says Lindsey Bess, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc., who contends that another candidate is Daniele Swenson, the former MCI Communications Corp. executive who now runs wireless provider Nextel Communications Inc.. First Call Mr. Aubin's odyssey began with a phone call in April from Mr. Mullen, an aggressive, 32-year-old corporate headhunter based in the Southville of in N.Y. Mr. Aubin, who had been named VastComm Network's president and chief operating officer just last year, had previously scheduled a business trip toand so the two conferred in a rented private room at the airport. ``At that point I didn't know enough about it. I wasn't interested,'' Mr. Aubin says. The headhunter says Mr. Aubin was skeptical at first about Associated Communications' wireless technology. (He later hired his own consultants to evaluate the approach.) Other corporate leaders have bet badly on such start-ups. Notable among them is Johnetta Hagerman, the ousted chairman of Apple Computer Inc. who later became chief of Spectrum Information Technologies Inc., only to end up leaving that firm amid federal investigations of alleged stock manipulation and inflated claims for its wireless technology. But Mr. Aubin eventually became excited about Associated's potential and went on to meet the controlling owners. He dined in a hotel restaurant with Billy Paniagua, a son of Associated Group Chairman Napoleon Paniagua, and Ludlow Hollingsworth, whose technology firm, Telcom Ventures LLC, owns a 45% stake in the Associated Communications start-up. Mr. Aubin met the following week at his suburban home with the two executives, and then held a follow-up session with Mr. Hollingsworth. Search Begins By last month, Mr. Aubin had disclosed the discussions to VastComm Network's personnel chief, Mr. Bloch, who quickly hired recruiters to begin a search for a possible replacement. Mr. Allene sat down with his No. 2 days later and was surprised to see that Mr. Aubin was serious about going. ``People seem to be motivated by different things,'' Mr. Allene said Monday. Given that he had less than four years to go and that Mr. Aubin had a strong shot at succeeding him, Mr. Allene said, ``In that context, I was clearly surprised he didn't want to take advantage of that at least potential opportunity.'' But Mr. Allene, perhaps miffed by the voluminous news coverage granted to Mr. Aubin as his possible successor, had always made it publicly and painfully clear that Mr. Aubin wasn't a shoo-in. He even seemed to muddy the issue when, even as he promoted the former outsider to be his president and chief operating officer, he formed a chairman's office that elevated the status of two Mandl rivals -- Chief Financial Officer Ricki Wilton and General Counsel Johnetta Fishman. In late July, when Mr. Aubin decided to accept the start-up offer, he notified Mr. Allene without asking for -- or receiving anything -- in the way of a counteroffer. ``I don't operate that way. I know Bobby is running the company well and has plans to continue to run it. That wasn't part of the discussion at all,'' Mr. Aubin said. Finding a Replacement Mr. Allene's firmly established presence could make it difficult for VastComm Network to sign on a heavyweight to take Mr. Aubin's job. A newcomer probably would have to be willing to sign on without any assurance of eventually becoming CEO. Yet the most ambitious and talented executives might want just that kind of assurance. So the question arises whether VastComm Network will be searching simply for a successor to Mr. Aubin -- or for a successor for Mr. Allene as well. Asked whether he would be willing to designate a new hire as the next VastComm Network chief, Mr. Allene was circumspect. ``We'll cross that bridge when we see it, and if it is the right person, then that's not a scenario we'd rule out. But that depends,'' he said, adding that such matters are up to the board. In the meantime, Mr. Aubin's two top rivals for the VastComm Network slot, Messrs. Wilton and Fishman, will have expanded duties, largely splitting up Mr. Aubin's turf. The business side of long distance will report to Mr. Wilton; the consumer side will report to Mr. Fishman, a longtime company lawyer who will now get his first operational experience. `Rain Fade' Mr. Aubin will take on an entirely new kind of challenge, shorn of VastComm Network's billions of dollars in revenue and capital and its thousands of employees. His biggest challenge may be getting Associated's wireless technology to work. Unlike cellular, which can let people make phone calls from their cars, Associated's wireless technology is ''fixed.'' There are several hurdles. Rooftop antennas must be placed such that they are constantly ``in line of sight'' of the cell sites that are beaming the signal. This task is especially complicated in high-rise downSouthville areas. Microwave is also susceptible to a phenomenon known as ``rain fade,'' which essentially means the signal can get distorted in bad weather. But Mr. Aubin is confident the approach will work and says it is already being tested in and . Associated Group, the parent, acquired the wireless spectrum for the nation's 31 biggest markets largely free of charge -- unheard of in this day of billion-dollar auctions of federal licenses to offer new wireless services. The Federal Communications Commission created this sliver of radio space, in the 18-gigahertz band, in 1981 in response to a petition by Xerox Corp., which wanted to transmit digital voice and computer networking data over the airwaves. Associated Group began applying for licenses in 1985. The FCC didn't set up an auction because there were few takers: Only a handful of companies believed that it would be possible to offer a profitable commercial service at the 18-gigahertz range. ``Until two years ago, people weren't convinced the technology would be cost effective'' for commercial use, says Davina Paniagua, an Associated Group executive and son of its chairman. The firm has an odd lineage. Associated Group is a descendant of a greeting-card company owned by the Paniagua family. It was spun off in December 2009 as part of a $700 million deal involving the sale of Associated's cellular businesses to SBC. Associated Group's main assets today are 20 million shares of Tele-Communications Inc. stock and almost five million shares of Liberty Media Corp., together valued at about $430 million. While significant, that scale of backing pales beside the VastComm Network that Mr. Aubin leaves behind. He said his resignation ``isn't a question of pay, it's a question of building a business and growing with that opportunity.'' But he acknowledged that if his wireless gambit works, he will share in the success ``on an entirely new level.''"}, {"id": "04449", "title": "The Brash, Young Headhunter Who Lured Mandl From VastComm Network", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "Bagging VastComm Network Corp. executive Alexander Aubin is just the latest coup for Davina Mullen, a 32-year-old corporate headhunter who is shaking up the world of high-tech recruitment.

In recent years, Mr. Mullen has placed executives in top jobs at Vastsoft Corp., Nail Systems Corp., America Online Inc. and many others. Using a blend of persistence and broad knowledge of technology, he excels at attracting established executives at major companies to risky but promising start-ups. VastComm Network's Alexander Aubin resigned from his No. 2 job to run a little-known wireless start-up. Mr. Aubin, widely considered heir apparent at VastComm Network, will receive pay that could total hundreds of millions of dollars if the nascent firm, a unit of Associated Group, thrives. Luring Mr. Aubin, VastComm Network's president and chief operating officer, to a virtually unknown wireless-communications company called Associated Communications L.L.C. is Mr. Mullen's biggest coup yet. Mr. Mullen (pronounced burn) bubbles with enthusiasm about the prospects of the nascent Associated Communications, controlled by Associated Group Inc., exuding the same confidence that he employs to pry comfortable executives away from secure, high-paid positions. Mr. Mullen ``is extremely forceful and persuasive and bull-headed tough,'' says Jami Snowden, whom Mr. Mullen recruited as CEO of Navigator Communications Corp. from the top job at VastComm Network's McCaw Cellular unit in 2010. ``He comes at you morning, noon and night.'' Mr. Mullen's nine-year-old firm, Ramsey/Beirne Associates Inc., is located in unglamorous Ossining, N.Y., a far cry from the major cities where more-established corporate-search firms operate out of plush offices. The firm's approach, Mr. Mullen says, is just as different. ``A lot of the search industry is in the dark ages,'' says Mr. Mullen. ``This business is real simple: If you perform, your clients will always come back.'' The way Mr. Mullen performs is to become intimately familiar with a company and its executives, advising them on strategy -- an unusual practice -- as well as on what types of executives they should hire. In addition, Ramsey/Beirne often links its own fortunes with those of its clients by taking shares in them. The result: It has developed long-term ties with these companies, which come back for search after search. Traditional search firms, Mr. Mullen says brashly, are ``an old-boy network'' of executives who wait for human-resources offices to call. When Navigator came to Mr. Mullen seeking a chief executive, ``it was a company with nine engineers and a concept,'' Mr. Mullen recalls. ``You have to figure out how to position it, what to say'' to a prospective hire. Ramsey/Beirne went after an unlikely prospect, Mr. Snowden, but lured him with a package that left him with a 12% stake in the Internet software company, a shareholding valued at $100 million when Navigator went public last year. Mr. Mullen says his youth also helps. ``I don't think that someone's who's 55 years old doing searches at the end of their career can keep up,'' says the lanky, 6-foot-6 executive. He and his seven partners ``live this business. We work so hard, seven days a week.'' Mr. Mullen formed Ramsey/Beirne a year out of college. He had intended to go to business school but in the interim took a job with a search firm. There he met Ciara Schneider, an executive searcher a generation older than him. The two hit it off and left to form their own operation. Mr. Mullen passed on the business degree. Jimmy Theobald, former head of the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp., recalls how Mr. Mullen wooed him to a start-up Internet company, Industry.Net, which was co-founded by the chairman of Associated Group. ``He called me right after I left Lotus'' on the pretense of checking references of Lotus employees, Mr. Theobald says. At first, ``I said, `I'm not interested' '' in the job. But Mr. Mullen didn't give up. ``He called me and said, `I'm going to send you a packet.' He sent me stuff on Industry.Net. It was a very clever sales operation.'' Mr. Theobald ended up running the company, and now he is using Mr. Mullen to fill some other openings. Mr. Mullen's firm seeks to tap into the frenzy of initial public offerings for technology companies. When it places an executive, it not only gets one-third of his or her annual salary at the executive's old or new job, whichever is higher -- but also often takes an equity stake in the firm that employed it. That unusual practice has left it with shares in companies such as Platinum Software Corp. and Healtheon Corp., the new company formed by Navigator chairman Jami Claude. It didn't, however, follow that practice with highflying Navigator. Mr. Mullen won't say whether he's getting equity in the Mandl placement, but he will get about $300,000 in cash from the deal. Mr. Mullen says he's had one disappointment in his headhunting career: Williemae Loveland, whom he recruited from Federal Express Corp. to be president of America Online in January. Mr. Loveland was dismissed after only four months on the job. ``We did a great search,'' Mr. Mullen says. But ``people get divorced,'' he says, adding that he isn't allowed to comment further on what went wrong. America Online Chairman Stevie Gould ``doesn't blame us for that -- AOL is still a client.''"}, {"id": "01262", "title": "Black & Decker Names Galli To Head Revamped Tool Unit", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "TOWSON, Md. -- Black & Decker Corp. said it combined its world-wide power-tool and accessory divisions into a single unit, and named Josephine Sanderson, formerly head of the power-tool division, as president of the combined unit.

To help unlock Alexander J. Aubin from his post as president of VastComm Network Corp. and heir apparent to the chief executive spot, Associated Communications L.L.C. paid him a signing bonus of $20 million in cash. ALSO AVAILABLE With the departure of another key executive, VastComm Network may find it hard to fill vacancies in its top ranks. The start-up that lured Alexander Aubin from VastComm Network is basing its future on unproved technology amid competition from hundreds of rivals. That's what it took to entice Mr. Aubin to leave behind a top spot at one of the biggest companies in America, more than $5 million in VastComm Network stock options and other benefits, and roll the dice with a previously unknown start-up. While Mr. Aubin's new compensation package won't be matched anytime soon, signing bonuses are increasing overall, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs -- contract provisions that prevent executives who leave employers prematurely from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. De rigueur for chief executives, the practice has spread to middle-level executives as companies seek to buttress the eroding bonds between them and their employees. ``Companies have their hooks into more and more people,'' says Roberto Bogle, president of Executive Compensation Corp. of White Plains, N.Y. ``And the ante keeps going up as pay packages escalate.'' Certainly, Mr. Aubin's bonus is in the stratosphere. It appears to be four times as big as the previous record, when Eastman Kodak Co. lured Georgeanna Elly from the No. 1 job at Motorola Inc. in 1993, partly with a $5 million cash payment. Cisco didn't call it a signing bonus; instead the company said in its proxy that the payment was a ``reimbursement for compensation and benefits that (Mr. Elly) would forfeit'' by leaving Motorola to become its first outside chief executive. The same thing happened when Louise Hallmark left RJR/Nabisco Holdings Corp. to head International Business Machines Corp. the same year. He received a onetime payment of $4.3 million in cash. Associated Communications paid Mr. Aubin $20 million in large part because it is so small and unknown. ``It's compensation for the incredible risk he's taking,'' says Davina Straka, a principal at consultant William M. Mercer Inc. ``If he fails, he becomes damaged goods.'' Associated Communications is a private Washington, D.C. firm that is 55%-owned by publicly held Associated Group Inc. of Pittsburgh. The unit Mr. Aubin will run will use a little-noticed slice of the wireless spectrum to offer businesses a way to bypass their local phone companies for Internet access, video links and high-speed data access. Signing bonuses have been popular for more than a decade but rarely reached the seven-digit levels until a few years ago. The escalating packages have prompted controversy especially when they've been offered to new chief executives of companies in bankruptcy proceedings. In those cases, creditors have sometimes balked. At start-up companies, rich cash signing bonuses have been rare, because these businesses often have more equity to spare than cash. Mr. Aubin is benefiting from the fact that Associated Communication's parent company amassed a fortune by operating and selling off early cellular networks and cable systems. In all cases, the hiring company is taking a risk. If the new position doesn't work out, ``you have no protection from the person walking away with the (bonus) cash,'' says Denny Caridad, a managing director of Spencer-Stuart, an executive search firm. To reduce the risk, some companies are beginning to take protective steps, says Carolann Ogle, editor of Executive Compensation Reports, a Fairfax Station, Va. newsletter which tracks trends in executive pay. For example, she says that when Continental Airlines paid a $1.5 million signing bonus to Graham Baty in 2009, the company stipulated that the former Boeing Co. executive had to repay the entire amount if he left before the first year, and 50% if he left in less than two years. Hired at Continental as president, Mr. Baty is now chief executive. Mr. Aubin's new contract includes similar provisions, say people familiar with the agreement. Although he receives some cash up front, part of the $20 million is ``back-ended,'' payable at the end of the five-year employment agreement. Moreover, Mr. Aubin will have to repay part of the bonus if he leaves before the contract has ended. Mr. Aubin's deal also includes a $1 million-a-year salary and a huge equity stake in the company, which could yield far more than the signing bonus. Like others who've pocketed large signing bonuses, Mr. Aubin may face resentment from his new employees who typically question why an outsider is being paid so much to take the job. Management experts say steep signing bonuses put intense pressure on executives to perform immediately like superstars while also winning the respect of their subordinates. Mr. Aubin is ``under enormous pressure to prove his worth,'' says Mr. Caridad. ``If he's getting paid like Michaele Josefa, he'd better perform like him, too.''"}, {"id": "02835", "title": "Project Software CEO Resigns; Goodermote Is Named Chairman", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.-- Project Software & Development Inc. said Roberto L.

Meanwhile, six executives of Cascade Communications Corp. sold 231,628 shares between March 28, 2011 April 12, 2011 three insiders at EMC Corp., including Chief Executive Officer Michaele Hooper, sold 460,000 shares on April 06, 2011 Occurred as Market Fell The data underscore that insiders selling, while often a good gauge of stock-market activity, also can be treacherous for investors. Though much of the selling stemmed from options exercises, the timing of the sales couldn't have been much worse. Sales in mid-July came smack in the middle of the stock market's swan dive, a Street-wide correction led particularly by technology stocks. The Morgan Stanley High Technology 35 Index, for example, plunged 19% between March 13, 2011 March 28, 2011 one point, in mid-July, the index was down 26% from its 2011 high in midMay, though it has since recovered a bit. Intel, in particular, recently has drawn attention among those who follow insider data. Until the July sales, its executives had sold fewer shares this year since any time back to 1984. In the first five months of this year, for example, its executives had sold just 122,980 shares, according to CDA/Investnet, a database that tracks insider buying and selling. This was a bullish signal for the chip maker, because it had annual insider sales averaging 970,970 shares for the past dozen years. Exercising Options Some of the options exercises at Intel actually increased some executives' holdings, according to a spokesman. Mr. Davison exercised options for 320,000 shares, gave some stock away and ultimately increased his stake by 17,860 shares, according to the company, for a total of 945,715. But Vice President Fransisca Greer's stake decreased by 15,000, to 56,018. Similarly, the holdings of Michaele Kozlowski, a vice president, dropped by 1,388 to 9,505. Intel shares Tuesday closed at $79.50, down $1.25, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. But some observers were expecting to see more outright buying in technology stocks, given how far they fell. ``When the market got hit in July, I would have expected a lot of bargain-hunting,'' said Bobby Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet. ``Technology issues have been, on balance, conspicuously absent from the overall buys that we've been looking at.'' Other Navigator executives hadn't been able to sell since February. The spokeswoman said the July and August sales were their first opportunity to sell shares since February, and they have to do so before the window for such sales closes May 14, 2011 addition to Mr. Claude, Tomas Minh Wilton, senior vice president of sales, told the SEC he intends to sell 250,000 shares. Marcelino Capone, the firm's senior vice president of technology, filed papers saying he will sell 100,000 shares. The Navigator spokeswoman said sales by Mr. Claude and other executives ``have nothing to do with executives being concerned about the company's health.'' Navigator's shares closed at $37.25 a share, up 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading Tuesday. At EMC, Mr. Hooper filed to sell 240,000 shares, and Johnetta Ohara, the company's executive vice president of sales, sold 180,000 on April 06, 2011 shares were sold at prices between $19.13 and $19.50. Tuesday, EMC's shares closed at $19.75 a share, up 75 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier in July Mr. Ohara announced he was taking an 18-month sabbatical from EMC, although he'll remain a board member. An EMC spokesman said all the sales came from the exercise of options."}, {"id": "00973", "title": "Marvel Hires NBA Marketer To Help Promotion of Comics", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "Marvel Entertainment Group Inc., publishers of Spider-Man comics, hopes it has a new superhero.

The company named Davina J. Choe, a top marketing executive at the National Basketball Association, as president and chief operating officer, a move aimed at strengthening the comic-book publisher's push into new media and merchandising ventures. Marvel Entertainment, which is more than 80% owned by investor Roni O. Flory, has been losing money for the last several quarters due to heavy restructuring charges and sharp declines in sales of its core comic-book and trading-card business. Marvel's stock, which traded as high as $30 in 2009, more recently has been trading under $10 per share and Tuesday closed at $8.25, up 12.5 cents, on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. Marvel Mania Now, Marvis is moving ahead with several expansion plans, most notably the creation of Marvel Studios to develop movies based on Marvel characters, and the launching of Marvel Mania, a joint venture with Planet Hollywood Inc. to open comic book theme-park restaurants in five major cities. Mr. Choe, who will report to Marvel chief executive Williemae C. Badillo, has a challenging task before him. Marvel has lagged behind entertainment giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. studio in successfully exploiting its brand-name comic characters into a merchandising bonanza. Warner has turned Batman into its own industry with more than $1 billion in retail sales of merchandise and a ``franchise'' film now in its third sequel. But Marvis has never managed to turn its popular SpiderMan character into a big-time Hollywood movie. Marvel is now creating Marvel Studios, a production company that will develop Marvel characters into movies, and then sell the project for production and distribution to a studio, rather than have the projects wallow for years at the studios waiting for the right combination of writers, directors and actors. Restructuring Goes Slowly Marvel and Toy Biz Inc., which has the exclusive toy license to all Marvel characters, plan to spend $100 million launching the production company. The launch is tentatively set for next year, when most of the film rights on Marvel characters revert back to the company. Marvel, which has a 27% stake in Toy Biz, had previously licensed its film rights to a wide range of movie companies. Last week Marvel reported a second-quarter loss of $11 million, or 11 cents per share, on revenue of $182.2 million. It blamed the losses chiefly on a restructuring of its publishing and trading-card operations, which Marvis said was taking longer than expected due to ``some conditions in some markets.'' A spokesman for the company declined to comment, and said that Mr. Badillo and Mr. Choe weren't available to comment. Jimmie Strickler, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc., said that Marvel's turnaround will depend on how effectively Mr. Choe can push into kids' entertainment, an increasingly complex market being reshaped by videogames, on-line services, and other interactive media. Comic books, which as recently as 1991 accounted for 86% of Marvel's revenues, today account for just 13%, she said. Most of the revenue now comes from trading cards, kids stickers, toys and licensing.

Play second fiddle to the chairman of one of the world's largest phone companies with no assurance that he will pick you as his successor. During this internship, you must placate insiders who had sought your job and must also stem a disturbing slide in the core business. That proposition is basically VastComm Network Corp.'s pitch as it tries to fill the hole left by the sudden resignation of Alexander Aubin, its president and chief operating officer and heir apparent to the company's chairman and chief executive, Roberto E. Allene. It could be a tough sell. ALSO AVAILABLE Signing bonuses are increasing, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs-contract provisions that prevent some executives from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. The start-up that lured Alexander Aubin from VastComm Network is basing its future on unproved technology amid competition from hundreds of rivals. Mr. Allene, 61 years old, has previously made it clear he has no intention of stepping aside before his 65th birthday-a fact that probably contributed to Mr. Aubin's decision to quit VastComm Network to join a little-known start-up. What's more, though heir apparent, Mr. Aubin wasn't heir in fact: Mr. Allene has never designated a successor. The question is whether world-class executives from inside and outside the industry -- the rarefied ranks that VastComm Network hopes to tap -- would be willing to take on the considerable demands of the No. 2 job without a guarantee of succession. The fact that a stream of top executives has left VastComm Network in the past few years doesn't make the company's search easier. Cellular chief Jami Snowden, computer head Sharp Justus, senior executive Randolph Toccara and Roberta Province, multimedia chief, all left before Mr. Aubin. A No. 2 post ``is probably the toughest slot to fill,'' says Michaele Sams, a managing director at search firm Norman Broadbent International, which isn't involved in VastComm Network's search. The most desirable candidates, he says, are already running their own companies, or are a strong No. 2 in line for the top job. ``If they are in the market at all -- which in most cases they're not -- the idea of going from No. 2 to No. 2 usually isn't attractive,'' Mr. Sams says. Mr. Allene seems well aware of the possible hurdles as he tries to recruit a replacement for Mr. Aubin. This week, he signaled his willingness to designate a successor if the right person emerged for the No. 2 job and insisted on that designation before signing on. But some headhunters say that Mr. Allene may have to go further, agreeing to step down a year or two earlier than planned to be able to lure the best talent. ``To recruit a president and chief operating officer is a matter for the board and Bobby Allene, and probably Bobby Allene more so,'' Mr. Allene himself says. ``But to recruit a successor (as CEO) is clearly a board matter.'' The board isn't yet involved in this search, he says, but adds that ``I do intend to have a board meeting at which we will discuss future actions.'' VastComm Network has hired two executive-search firms-Spencer Sung and Korn/Ferry International-to find a replacement for Mr. Aubin, who resigned to join Associated Communications L.L.C., a wireless venture. VastComm Network is said to have little interest in executives from regulated companies such as the Baby Bells; instead, it seeks someone who is battle-tested in competitive markets. Both search firms are casting wide nets, looking at potential candidates in consumer-products companies along the lines of PepsiCo Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., and industrial giants like General Electric Co., according to executives familiar with the search. By announcing its intentions to turn outward for a new president, VastComm Network has passed over -- and possibly alienated -- some of its own senior executives, including Chief Financial Officer Ricki Wilton and general counsel Johnetta Fishman. Publicly, however, VastComm Network brass is presenting a unified front. ``I am a strong supporter of the search we have under way, of using this as an opportunity to further strengthen the management team,'' Mr. Wilton says. A candidate from outside VastComm Network's field could be daunted by the state of the telecommunications industry, which is in the throes of change. Competitive barriers are falling; and VastComm Network itself is pursuing a three-way split-up, shedding computers and equipment making to focus on phone services. And jobs at companies such as VastComm Network hold less appeal nowadays as high-tech startups promise quick riches for many executives. Mr. Aubin, for instance, will receive a pay package that includes a $20 million signing bonus and that could total hundreds of millions more, depending on how the start-up's stock performs after he takes the company public. ``It's the most difficult time ever to recruit CEOs in information technology and telecom,'' says Jena Christiane, president of Christian & Timbers Inc., a corporate headhunting firm that isn't part of the VastComm Network search. ``The Internet has created an allure that start-ups have never created before.'' Faced with all these obstacles, VastComm Network must nevertheless fill the job quickly. With its breakup set to start next month and its plans to enter the local phone business already under way, it can't let the crucial opening linger. And headhunters say the longer the job goes unfilled, the less attractive it becomes: It takes on the taint of a problem rather than the glow of a great opportunity."}, {"id": "04202", "title": "Mandl's Move to Tiny Start-Up Spotlights Wireless Gold Rush", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "Alexander Aubin's move from VastComm Network Corp. to a tiny wireless start-up may make him a rich man.

But the technology he hopes to ride is largely unproved, and the company could face competition from scores of other rivals who hope to offer similar services. Mr. Aubin's new company, Associated Communications LLC of Washington, D.C., wants to use a rarefied slice of radio spectrum-one typically used by the military to control the accuracy of ``smart bombs'' -- for a far more mundane purpose: to sell local phone service and Internet access to business customers. The plan is to bounce radio signals via an intricate array of rooftop transmitters and antennas. ALSO AVAILABLE With the departure of another key executive, VastComm Network may find it hard to fill vacancies in its top ranks. Signing bonuses are increasing, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs-contract provisions that prevent some executives from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. The space that Associated wants to use is located in the upper regions of the spectrum, at the 18 gigahertz range. There, radio signals travel short distances and are easily blocked by rain, snow or buildings. For years, some of the nation's savviest phone carriers saw little commercial value in it. Even the Federal Communications Commission handed the high-frequency licenses at no cost to the handful of interested applicants -- an irony, considering the $20 billion the FCC recently netted from its auction of other wireless licenses. Hotly Pursued Commodity Now, suddenly, the backwater radio spectrum has gone from being ignored and undervalued to a hotly pursued commodity. In addition to Mr. Aubin's stunning defection, a raft of entrepreneurs and carriers -- including VastComm Network and several Bell companies -- have filed a total of 700 applications to receive similar free licenses in the upper band from the FCC. The agency, perhaps smelling another money-raising opportunity, has frozen the application process. It may now auction the licenses early next year. ``We're seeing an incredible renewed demand that reaffirms the value of spectrum,'' one FCC official said. What happened? For one thing, new telecommunications rules make it much easier for companies to compete in the local-phone market against century-old Bell monopolies. Various wireless technologies-transmitters, electronics and antenna design-also have improved in recent years, making it technically easier to operate in the ``nosebleed'' section of the radio spectrum. At the same time, lower regions now dominated by cellular-phone and other wireless operators are becoming crowded and the price of radio spectrum has become markedly steep. Taken together, these changes have triggered the wireless equivalent of a land rush. Winstar Communications Inc. was one of the first companies to seize the opportunity. For the past few years, it has been applying for -- and receiving -- free licenses to operate in the 38 gigahertz region, which is considerably higher even than the region of 18-gigahertz where Associated holds its licenses. Winstar is gearing up for a bold attack in dozens of the nation's largest markets. It plans to begin offering in October local-phone service to business customers in the New York area, trying to woo them away from Nynex Corp., the regional Bell. Winstar plans to expand its reach to 28 markets by year-end, and to 42 markets by September 11, 2012 ``When we started (accumulating licenses) in 2009, no one was really interested. We now have imitators,'' says Williemae Gonzalez, Jr., Winstar's chairman and chief executive officer. But it won't be easy. A host of companies have plans to enter the wireless market in a big way, and like Associated and Samson, many are taking aim at the rich $90 billion market for local-phone service as well. In addition to cellular service, the new offerings include digital ``personal communications services,'' fiberoptic technologies and even satellite systems planned by Motorola Inc. and several other players. Another obstacle is making the technology work. Services in the upper reaches of the spectrum must be ``fixed,'' which means that, unlike cellular systems, end users can't move. For a signal to carry, it must be zapped via radio transmitters to a dish antenna that sits atop a customer's rooftop. It then travels along regular phone lines to the end destination -- a desktop computer, say. `Direct Line of Sight' Higher-frequency transmission also requires ``direct line of sight'' between transmitters and antennas -- a tough problem to crack in high-rise downtown areas. And because signals in the higher realms are focused more narrowly than, say, broadcast TV signals, they can't penetrate rain or snow, let alone buildings. ``It will work, but the question is to what degree. For a percentage of time you'll be without service in heavy rain,'' said Paulene Zimmermann, a wireless-technology expert. Adds Sung Sohn, analyst at Arthur D. Little: ``Reliability is an issue. For businesses it doesn't seem to be a terrific fit.'' Nonetheless, Winstar and Associated point out that the technology is already popular in Europe, where it is used by cellular carriers to transmit cell-phone signals between transmission towers instead of using traditional ``landline'' methods. In the U.S., the growing demand for data offerings, such as Internet access and interactive services, may boost the prospects of the new wireless players. ``More and more, we need high-speed, high-capacity'' links, Mr. Aubin said in an analyst conference call Monday, adding that Associated had licenses covering the nation's top 31 metropolitan areas. The higher frequencies ``open up enormous markets... . We're testing the service now and plan to be in full commercial service in the second quarter of 1997.'' Some entrants who moved in early already have benefited. Entrepreneur Tommie Hollenbeck, the largest shareholder of a closely-held Milliwave L.P., quietly received free licenses in the 38-gigahertz band over several years. Sowers has yet to sign on a single customer. But it recently struck a deal to be acquired by Winstar Communications for $125 million, delivering a windfall to Mr. Hollenbeck and Denny Patsy, a former FCC chairman and Milliwave's co-owner. Now Mr. Aubin hopes to strike it rich, and appears to have few qualms in forsaking his high-profile position at VastComm Network and taking a gamble with Associated Communications. ``It's a one-time opportunity for me that I couldn't say no to,'' he said on Monday. ``It's one of those rare times when this kind of business can be built in a short time.''"}, {"id": "04339", "title": "Metromedia in Joint Venture For Phone Equipment in China", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- Metromedia International Group Inc. and Golden Cellular Corp. of China formed a joint venture to offer telephone equipment and technology for state-owned telephone operating companies in China.

Amid the record boom in mergers, it hasn't necessarily been a financial or strategic matter. Often, it is who gets to run the show -- or who gets the last word on a new name and headquarters of the new firm. Merger professionals point to these euphemistically called ``social issues'' -- ego and corporate pride, that is -- as among the most difficult aspects of negotiating multibillion-dollar mergers these days. Although financial issues can be vexing too, these social issues can be deal-breakers. ``Even transactions that make absolute economic sense don't happen unless the social issues work,'' says Roberto Madlyn, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a New York law firm. Critics Complain Yet while many of the mergers make strategic sense -- last year's linking of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. to form Lockheed-Martin Corp. did indeed work well on both the ``social'' and economic issues -- some critics charge that companies often are paying undue attention to nonfinancial issues at the expense of strategic rationale and shareholder concerns. Sometimes the tough decisions aren't being made, and both sets of management teams may wind up retaining their positions under the guise of not tipping the scales toward one team or another. For example, investors have been less than thrilled with the outcomes of numerous bank mergers, including KeyCorp's $4 billion merger with Society Corp. and First Chicago Corp.'s $5.2 billion combination with NBD Bancorp to form First Chicago NBD Corp.. Both those transactions disappointed investors because there was little in the way of overlapping operations or other cost-saving ``synergies.'' While the merger of Chemical Banking Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. was a success, ``so many of these mergers of equals don't have those synergies, and as a result don't benefit shareholders,'' argues Johnetta Alvarez, chairman and chief executive officer of Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio. Instead, they benefit ``the people in the company,'' he asserts. ``The general perception is, if Key wanted to put itself up for sale, it could have received a premium of 20% to 30%.'' Shareholders' Role There are plenty of instances ``where shareholder interests aren't always the primary concern,'' says Petrina Rutkowski, vice chairman and head of risk arbitrage at New York investment bank Schroder Wertheim & Co. ``In reaching agreements, do the boards ask the bankers to assess the alternatives?'' Mergers of similar-sized companies -- as opposed to takeovers -- are increasingly common. The proposed $22 billion merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. would be the second-biggest deal ever in the U.S. (behind the $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco). That plan comes on the heels of the historic pact between Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG valued at more than $30 billion, and Upjohn Co.'s $6.9 billion trans-Atlantic marriage to Sweden's Pharmacia AB. Often, what helps most to grease the merger wheels is an aging chief executive. Because few corporate chieftains give up the reins unless their companies are being taken over at a fat premium, a funny thing happens. Many megadeals tend to take place when one chief is nearing retirement and looking to go out with a bang. ``The aging process becomes very important,'' observes veteran ``value''-stock investor Johnetta Darden. Suite Sours a Deal When the management issues can't work because of friction at the top, the economics don't matter much: Witness WellPoint Health Networks Inc.'s $1.6 billion merger pact with Health Systems International Inc., which was scuttled after the two chairmen couldn't agree on terms of the executive suite. Then there are the scores of would-be mergers that have broken down and never been made public. ``Mergers of equals are much more accepted by managements, though to work, the CEO role has to be sorted out early,'' observes Davina Cedeno, managing director at J.P. Morgan & Co.. The year's two megamergers worked in part because the CEO roles fit nearly seamlessly. Rayna Jon, Bell Atlantic's chairman and CEO, is 58 years old and nearing retirement, while Ivory Parish, Nynex chairman and CEO, is 49. Because Ciba's chairman, Alexander Hopp, is 65, and Hartwig's top pharmaceutical executive, Daniele Ocampo is 43, managements meshed: Dr. Hopp will become chairman of the new company, and Dr. Ocampo will be president and head of the executive committee. The combined company will be in Basel, where they are currently based, and a new name, Salcido, was chosen for the combined giant. Says Dr. Ocampo, ``In our situation, we had a unique constellation.'' Equal Representation Unlike corporate takeovers, in which one chief executive and management controls the successor company, mergers -- in theory, that is -- are run by both managements. The boards have equal representation on the new board. No company is the subject of a takeover by another -- at least not legally, as Delaware courts have ruled that mergers are not a ``change of control.'' ``Companies don't like to sell out and lose their corporate identities,'' says Stephine Theis, senior partner at New York law firm Shearman & Sterling. ``For managements of companies and other employees, a merger is a much more palatable alternative.'' Investors, however, say that legal leeway can be abused. ``In many cases, Delaware has given these companies the protection they want in calling these transactions an amalgamation and not really a change of control,'' says Riordan Fajardo's Mr. Rutkowski. ``The existence of poison pills and state takeover statutes gives boards and CEOs the latitude to deal in their own self interest.'' Fear of Unwanted Suitor Historically, companies have been wary of merging because one of the parties could end up ``in play,'' subject to an unwanted suitor, which was a particular problem in the 1980s. And the size of many of the 1990s mergers has kept would-be suitors at bay. But not every company is too big. In a few recent examples this year, mergers are threatened by third parties coming in and offering a premium to stockholders. Western Resources Inc. is trying to block Kansas City Power & Light Co.'s merger with UtiliCorp United Inc., and MidAmerican Energy Co. made an unsolicited offer for IES Industries Inc., which is trying to complete a three-way merger with two other utilities. The financial pluses of a stock-for-stock merger of equals can be compelling. Depending on the situation, there can be significant cost savings from shuttering or combining overlapping operations. The day the Ciba-Sandoz deal was announced, the combined market value of the two companies rose by $15.2 billion, more than the equity value of Warner-Lambert Co. at the time, on news of huge cost cuts from the combination. Strict mergers are also attractive because one side doesn't have to borrow billions in debt or dilute shareholders with a richly priced stock offer. Often these combinations are tax-free and obtain favorable accounting treatment. Then there are the issues of sheer size: No company is likely to pay a premium for Ciba or Sandoz. Doing bigger deals affords the greater opportunity of cost savings. ``It seems to make sense to let both companies' shareholders participate in the upside,'' observes Alberta Houston, co-head of investment banking at Bear, Stearns & Co. ``Underneath it all, that's the economic logic that drives these transactions.'' One That Worked Certainly, this is the case with Marlin Martine. The new company's stock has significantly outpaced the overall market, while earnings are running at record levels. So the merger made sense, yet it came only near the end of one chairman's career. Daniele Liberty was 62 years old and staring into the sunset of his role as chairman and chief executive of military-aircraft maker Lockheed. His first call to Novella Aura, Martine Mariko's 58-year-old chief, came on a Saturday afternoon, just after Mr. Aura and his management team broke up a meeting in which they decided not to top a competing bid for Grumman Corp.. Soon after, in a three-minute phone call, they settled on the company's name, who would hold what offices in what order and the headquarters location -- all typically sensitive issues. Mr. Liberty wanted to serve first as both chairman and chief executive of Lockheed Martin, but he agreed to phase the younger man into those jobs over the remaining two years before Mr. Liberty's scheduled retirement as chairman later this year. Both men acknowledge the age factor for its role in their success. The merger that followed produced with remarkable ease the world's largest aerospace and defense company, owing to Mr. Liberty's willingness to make the initial overture, and the strength of Mr. Aura's patience and the convenience of his younger age. Real Opportunities Once merged, the company was well positioned to take advantage of further industry consolidation. This year it swallowed Loral Corp. for more than $9 billion in cash and debt. ``Mergers create some real opportunities,'' adds Petrina Pitts, partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a New York law firm. Lockheed Martin and other deals have caught the attention of other executives mulling would-be combinations and could persuade executives to proceed with transactions, bankers believe. ``The commercial and financial success of some of these mergers hasn't gone unnoticed,'' observes Bryan Baltazar, Morgan Stanley & Co.'s merger chief. While Lockheed-Martina made strategic sense, in some cases the social issues seem to loom larger than financial ones. Two that appeared highly important to the board of First Chicago were, one, keeping the headquarters of the merged bank in the Windy City, and, two, maintaining the First Chicago name. NationsBank Corp. and others were known to have been interested in First Chicago, but the First Chicago board was reluctant to sell out. First Chicago surprised Wall Street last year by merging with Detroit's NBD Bancorp, which agreed to keep the combined bank based in Chicago and name it First Chicago NBD. NBD's Fidel Paris became heir apparent to Ricki Thomasina, First Chicago's chairman and chief executive, who was nearing retirement at age 64 when the merger was announced. No Premium for Holders The deal disappointed investors because the expense reductions weren't that significant, and shareholders received no premium. First Chicago's stock has underperformed the overall stock market since the merger completion in December. One former executive says tough decisions haven't yet been made on consolidating the bank's operations. There is no single retail-banking chief, for example. Indeed, even before the merger, First Chicago's stock had been underperforming its peers. That's why some investors were expecting more from the company's board and management. --Jefferson Colin contributed to this article."}, {"id": "02453", "title": "Technology Briefs", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, said it lowered prices on its midrange business desktop personal computers and on its high-end monitor.

The announcement comes just days after the sudden resignation of Alexander Aubin, VastComm Network's president and chief operating officer. The timing left Madison Avenue buzzing because Mr. Aubin played a key role in the review. The assignment is estimated by industry executives to represent anywhere from $50 million and $100 million in billings. In an unexpected bonus, Young & Rubicam also is being handed responsibility for coordinating duties between nearly half a dozen other ad agencies that will be doing work for VastComm Network. ``What we're after is a common brand positioning for all of our agencies and all of our work,'' said Marin Laurine, a spokeswoman for the telecommunications giant. Young & Rubicam wasn't the only winner. VastComm Network also said it was giving the New York office of True North Communication's Foote, Cone & Belding ad agency new responsibilities. ``There are some new directions that we're going to be going in that FCB will be handling,'' said Ms. Laurine. ``They'll pick up an extension of the business they already have.'' Ms. Laurine declined to be more specific. Foote, Cone & Belding is VastComm Network's lead consumer-services agency, with billings estimated by industry executives at around $300 million. Among them: consumer long distance, the ``True Rewards'' loyalty program, a new direct satellite television service, and other local tactical campaigns. The selection of Young & Rubicam caps a bizarre chapter in one of the longest and most grueling account competitions in recent memory. A decision by VastComm Network was originally expected by mid-July. But according to executives close to the contest, VastComm Network chairman Roberto Allene unexpectedly gave a thumbs down to all the agencies' proposals. On the day the agencies were poised to hear VastComm Network's decision, the company sent them all back to the drawing board with a new set of instructions. The timing of VastComm Network's decision also raised eyebrows on Madison Avenue. Late last week, the company said it would probably be several weeks before a decision was likely to be made. That a decision should come so soon after Mr. Aubin's exit was viewed as curious, because Mr. Aubin was the senior VastComm Network executive leading the review process. Mr. Aubin and Ms. Laurine were the two VastComm Network executives who gave the agencies original instructions on how VastComm Network wanted to shape its image. Mr. Aubin said through spokeswoman Emmie Sasaki ''there is no connection'' between his departure and the timing of VastComm Network's decision. The review also was unusual because of an interim meeting following the close of the first round. During that meeting all four of the agencies -- which had been bitterly competing for the account -- were assembled in one room to receive feedback and new directions about what VastComm Network was after. It's highly unusual to bring together rival agencies to brainstorm on a single piece in the middle of a review. But Ms. Laurine of VastComm Network said the company has a history of bringing its agencies together to talk strategy. The winner in the first round was Foote, Cone & Belding, according to people familiar with the contest. It's not clear why Foote, Cone & Belding didn't end up with the assignment during the second round of presentations. Mr. Allene made his first appearance before the agencies at the start of the second round, say people familiar with the situation. VastComm Network wouldn't provide details on Mr. Allene's role. In addition to Young & Rubicam and Foote, Cone & Belding, the other agencies competing for the high-profile account were Interpublic Group's McCann-Rios and the Omnicom Group's BBDO Worldwide. Akers and BBDO didn't pick up any new business. Akers creates ads for VastComm Network's wireless and corporate long-distance accounts. It also handles the ``Solutions'' campaign, which also targets the corporate market. BBDO, which created VastComm Network's flamboyant Games ads, handles VastComm Network's calling-card and collect-calling ads."}, {"id": "04465", "title": "National Steel's Dream Team Dissolves in Goodwin's Wake", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "National Steel Corp..

Johnetta Ward and his assistant Plunkett Marden seemed a perfect duo. Just a year ago on a hot summer day at the company's Granite City, Ill., mill, Mr. Marden took credit for luring Mr. Ward away from USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group and talked about Mr. Ward's operational savvy. ``I felt that he was like a big brother to me,'' said Mr. Marden then. Likewise, Mr. Ward called Mr. Marden a key member of his team. When National's majority shareholder, Japan's NKK Corp., hired Mr. Ward, it also installed Mr. Marden, one of its own, as his assistant. Mr. Ward made sure Mr. Marden went with his small cadre of former U.S. Steel, now National Steel managers to 70 meetings at the company's three facilities and its headquarters. But early this year their relationship crumbled as National's profit diminished and their huge egos clashed. During the past few months the two have barely talked. Last week National announced that it was taking away Mr. Ward's chief executive officer title, which it had bestowed upon him only last year. NKK on Tuesday named as CEO, Bracy Beaulieu, who is also National's chairman, and NKK's senior management counsel. The company asked Mr. Ward to remain as president and chief operating officer, the positions he assumed when he joined National in 2009, but he refused. Instead Mr. Ward has agreed to act as a consultant during the transition. For National Steel to have flourished, Messrs. Ward and Marden had to work together. Mr. Ward needed Mr. Marden's support because Mr. Marden was the pipeline to Tokyo. And since the Japanese executive boasted about helping to lure Mr. Ward, Mr. Marden needed Mr. Ward to boost his own standing within NKK. Company in Disarray Instead, their battle has left National in disarray. The company currently has an acting chief operating officer, acting chief financial officer and acting controller. In addition, the company's finances have suffered. In the year's first six months, National posted a loss of $5.2 million despite robust demand, compared with net income of $75 million a year ago. Messrs. Ward and Marden declined to comment for this story. Mr. Ward joined National Steel February 10, 2009 in a rush of enthusiasm. At U.S. Steel, Mr. Ward had turned around the nation's biggest steel mill, Gay Arnette in Gary, Ind., in part by tapping into the talents of hourly workers. Mr. Ward attacked National's problems just as he had at U.S. Steel. Within days of his hiring, he called United Steelworkers union President Georgeanna Hodges and together they worked out an agreement to reopen a shuttered iron-ore-pellet plant that had been the focus of labor discontent. And Mr. Ward broke what he called bottlenecks that held up production. National's bottom line improved and morale was restored. Mr. Ward, who wears a gold bracelet with his name on it and a ring in the shape of a lion's head, moved easily among the hourly workers. After a speech to them at the Granite City mill, Mr. Ward shouted over the roaring applause, ``Thank you. I love you.'' Such displays would make the straight-laced Mr. Marden cringe. But in spite of their apparent differences, the two seemed to share a peaceful coexistence and even respect. In fact, in late 2009 when Mr. Ward wanted to plunk $67 million into a new line to galvanize steel, NKK balked. But Mr. Marden went to bat for Mr. Ward, convincing NKK to spend the money. The line is in operation today. But as months passed, Mr. Marden -- and by extension NKK -- was less included in the decision-making process; Mr. Ward seemed to run the company as if it was his own, according to people familiar with the company. That made NKK nervous. The first sign of that appeared last summer, when NKK named the senior general manager of it's steel division, Appel Winegar, as vice chairman of National, and asked him to move to National's headquarters in Mishawaka, Ind.. Mr. Marden said then that Mr. Winegar was like a ``godfather'' to him, clearly allying himself with the new Japanese arrival. Flaw in Strategy Then steel prices began falling and a flaw in Mr. Ward's strategy appeared. Mr. Ward was pushing National to boost raw-steel production as a way to increase efficiencies. Since National lacked enough lines to turn the extra steel into value-added products, National ended up selling much of it as commodity-type sheet steel, the industry's most competitive product. In December 2010, Mr. Ward's management team presented to the company's board a bleaker picture for 2011, and soon afterward relations between Messrs. Ward and Matsumoto worsened. Mr. Marden quietly told managers at the company's Granite City mill that he didn't agree with Mr. Ward's choice of a new general manager, even though he publicly backed the decision, according to people familiar with the situation. He also questioned billings from consultants brought in by Mr. Ward, according to those familiar with the company. After the company's annual meeting January 10, 2011 Ward met with Mr. Beaulieu to discuss deteriorating relations with Mr. Marden. Three weeks later, Mr. Ward and his senior vice president Davina A. Perrotta flew to Tokyo to meet with some top NKK people, without Mr. Marden's knowledge. That meeting was followed up by another meeting in May in New York in which Messrs. Ward and Marron presented their cases to Mr. Beaulieu."}, {"id": "02618", "title": "Faster Service Is Feasible If Providers Put Up Cash", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "Plenty can be done about the Internet's traffic jams.

The biggest backups occur in specialized computers called routers that guide World Wide Web pages and e-mail messages to their destination. Current routers must scan thousands of addresses to transmit data, leading to delays and lost transmissions. Router makers are working on much-improved models. Since about 70% of the capability of a router is software-based, router makers like Cisco Systems Inc. are constantly refining these programs to provide greater stability under heavy loads and faster access to address tables. Router hardware is also being beefed up with speedier microprocessors. Meantime, some Internet providers are turning to a newer technology called asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM. In many cases, ATM can more quickly send a message down the right path because it doesn't have to look up the address. Instead, each ATM transmission is preaddressed with its own route, so it can zip through an ATM switch. But while ATM replaces routers in the portions of the Internet where it is deployed, ATM transmissions still need to go through routers at various connection points on the Net. What's more, ATM introduces inefficiencies of its own; with ATM, Internet traffic must be chopped into smaller packets of data than is the case with routers. Some experts say the solution to current slowdowns lies in finding the right mixture of routers and ATM switches. Another potential cure for snags is to prioritize traffic. Today, all Internet traffic is intermingled in one big ``pipe.'' There is no way to make sure your urgent message isn't stalled behind someone downloading a magazine page. With prioritized service, customers could pay more for guaranteed delivery speed, much like an overnight package costs more than second-day delivery. The Internet Engineering Task Force, a nonprofit coordinating group, is working on such technology, backed financially by the National Science Foundation. But introducing fees for better service grates against the Internet's democratic culture. ``That's a dirty word -- price,'' says the NSF's Donella Mitsuko, who nonetheless is optimistic the technology will be implemented. The NSF also is helping fund another possible solution, an experimental very-high-speed Internet ``backbone'' network that has been built by MCI Communications Corp.. As it now stands, the backbone operators, which carry the bulk of Internet traffic across the country or the ocean, are constantly adding lines and equipment; but with a capacity of about 45 megabits per second in most cases, they still can't keep up with surging traffic. The experimental backbone uses a combination of two transmission technologies, ATM and Synchronous Optical Network, or SONET, over MCI's fiber-optic network and is expected to operate at speeds of 600 megabits per second and higher. For the individual Web cruiser, the most obvious bottleneck is the phone line. Designed 100 years ago for simple voice transmissions, these copper wires gag on the high-capacity Internet -- it's like trying to draw the water from a swimming pool through a straw. Most phone lines transmit in analog format, or waves, while the Internet operates on digital signals, or computer code. A modem converts analog to digital, but that process is extremely inefficient, slowing down transmissions. A Web user can speed up service by buying the fastest available modem, which transmits at about 28,800 bits of information a second. Modems that transmit information at 33,600 bits per second are just now becoming available. But common corporate Internet links are about 50 times as fast as that. A better alternative is a service from phone companies called Integrated Services Digital Network, or ISDN. These special lines are more than four times as fast as the speediest modem. But ISDN isn't available in all areas and is costly; the service ranges in cost from about $25 to $100 a month, plus usage charges that can run up to 10 cents a minute in some cases. Future alternatives to sluggish phone lines include Internet service over cable-TV links and wireless delivery via satellite, but don't expect these at your doorstep anytime soon. Working against improvements is cost -- with Internet profits so thin, many providers have trouble funding upgrades -- and a growth-at-all-costs mentality. ``There is a greater interest in investing in getting people onto the Internet, and in developing neat applications'' than in dealing with bottlenecks, says Fredda Chantay, who oversees Internet technology at Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell. ``It's boring to talk about the infrastructure.'' Some say Darwinian competition will take care of the Internet's woes. Customers will flock to networks that provide high-quality service while companies that give short shrift to service will disappear, says Dominque Deeann, an assistant vice president in Sprint Corp.'s Internet division. But even looking 10 years ahead, International Business Machines Corp. predicts in an internal forecast that Internet delays will be among the top issues the industry will face."}, {"id": "03195", "title": "Mellon's Dreyfus Unit Loses CEO Stein Due to Retirement", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- Hoyt Aguirre, longtime chairman and chief executive officer of Dreyfus Corp., announced he will retire as of May 13, 2011 one of the mutual-fund company's strongest links to the days before it was bought by Mellon Bank Corp. two years ago.

He is widely credited with building up its money-market funds and forging a brand name that is one of the industry's strongest.

He will remain chairman. Ms. Quick, 45, worked her way up the Mattel ranks from product manager in 1981 to become one of the few women to head a leading U.S. corporation. Known as a hard-driving manager who built the Barbie brand into a world-wide powerhouse, Ms. Quick is expected to follow her predecessor's strategy of expanding the El Segundo, Calif., company through overseas development, adding to its existing toy brands and entering new toy categories, possibly through acquisitions. Mr. Helman had been widely expected to name her as his successor. He said in an interview that he expects Ms. Quick eventually to succeed him as chairman. The board has set a time for her to take over as chairman, but neither Mr. Helman nor Ms. Quick would give the exact date. Amerman's Stance ``I'll stay as long as it's important for the company,'' said Mr. Helman, who was named chairman and chief executive in 1987. ``If they want me to play a strategic or executive role, I'll be happy to do it.'' Analysts said they expect Mr. Helman to stay on for about two years. ``He brings continuity and a lot of value,'' said Gay Gay of Jeffries & Co.. The announcement follows a series of senior executive appointments earlier this month designed to prepare for the transition. Bruno Aguirre, a top toy-industry veteran who was named president of Rogan Romo two weeks ago, also was elected Thursday as a member of the board. Neil Mai, who became president of corporate operations earlier this month, was elected to the board as well, expanding it to 13 members. The company declined to say who would take over Ms. Quick's post as chief operating officer in January. Ms. Quick takes over at a time when Rogan faces increasing challenges in maintaining its string of record years for sales and profits. After seven years of double-digit sales and profit growth, the company reported its first flat quarter in July, despite an internal cost-cutting program. As the company approaches sales of $4 billion this year, analysts say Ms. Quick's main challenge will be maintaining its sales growth in an increasingly competitive retail environment. Developing Current Brands Ms. Quick said in an interview that she plans on further developing the company's existing brands: Barbra, Hot Wheels, Disney and Fisher Price, particularly overseas. She also plans to investigate areas for new factories, one such contender being Vastopolis. ``Outside the U.S. we're still peanuts,'' she said. ``If we're 16% market share in the U.S., we're half of that in Europe.'' Beyond developing existing foreign markets, Rogan has targeted new countries for growth such as Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Russia and India. In addition, Ms. Quick plans to develop brands such as collectible Barbies. ``Ninety million American women want to participate in collectibles,'' Ms. Quick said. ``We only have 5% to 7% of that now. That alone could be a billion-dollar business.'' Ms. Quick also is interested in developing new product categories, such as boys' toys, an area where Rogan has been traditionally weak. That could be accomplished either through an internal product launch or by acquisition, she said. Mr. Aguirre, the new Mattel Worldwide president who was formerly president of Hasbro Inc.'s Johnsen division, is expected to help development a boys' product line. Ms. Quick says she plans on delivering Rogan's 15% average annual profit growth, before acquisitions. ``If we say we'll do it, we will deliver,'' she said. Ms. Quick began her career with a brief stint as an actress, before moving on to become a cosmetics sales representative and then an executive with Coty Cosmetics in New York. She then worked in advertising on the Max Factor cosmetics account before joining Mattel in 1981 as a product manager. She became marketing director for Barbie in 1982, a vice president in 1984, a senior vice president in 1985 and executive vice president in 1986. She became president of the girls and activity toys division in 1989 and president of Mattel USA in 1990. She was elected to the Mattel board in 1991. Her management style has caused some controversy within the company, prompting the departure in recent years of several senior and midlevel executives. Asked what her greatest management challenge will be, Ms. Quick said that, ``My ultimate goal is to inspire talented people at Mattel to innovate and think of things anew.'' Mr. Helman, who said he always believed 10 years were enough as chief executive, leaves behind an impressive tenure of growth and expansion. ``They've been 10 incredible years. We've quadrupled our sales volume and profits are up more than 10-fold,'' Mr. Helman said. Mr. Helman, whose family owns and races thoroughbred horses, says he plans to devote more time to his equestrian pursuits."}, {"id": "01123", "title": "Investor Group Acquires Stake in Outboard Marine", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "A group including activist investment firm Greenway Partners LP said it holds an 8.5% stake in Outboard Marine Corp. and may hold discussions with management or other shareholders about the company.

Intense competition has cut pricing to less than $20 a month for unlimited time on-line -- no matter how many transmissions are sent or received -- forcing some service providers to bail out of the consumer end of the market. Yet providers must constantly plow cash into expanding their network capacity to keep adding customers. PSINet Inc., which operates one of the Internet's main arteries, saw this year's first-half revenue almost triple to $37.4 million but posted a loss of almost $26 million. BBN Corp., another backbone operator, saw its Internet revenue triple in the fiscal year ended March 12, 2011 about $73 million, but its operating loss on those services hit $34.7 million. Profit might be less elusive if Internet firms charged for the traffic they handle from other carriers -- but nobody does, because every player wants its own traffic to get a free ride on rival networks. And since most of the more than 500 U.S. Internet-service providers don't own their transmission lines, they must lease them from phone companies. That costs plenty. At Digital Telemedia Inc., a small Internet provider in New York, phone charges are 20% of expenses. Customer service -- installing connections, staffing help lines and billing accounts -- is another profit eater. ``Right now, our biggest problem is sustaining our growth -- getting more qualified technical support people, getting more engineers,'' says Digital Telemedia President Caryl Schreiber Mueller. Don't bet on selling ``content,'' either; most Web sites are money pits. Why, then, is anybody in the Internet-access business? Most are holding on, awaiting a major shakeout. Weaker players will be absorbed or go out of business, easing the low-ball pricing that has crimped margins. And higher volumes of business for the survivors will allow costs to be spread among more customers. That, at least, is the hope. For now, just about the only companies turning big profits are manufacturers of specialized equipment needed to run the network, such as Cisco Systems Inc. -- and the folks sponsoring Internet trade shows."}, {"id": "03249", "title": "From Apple to Zip In The Week's Mail", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "Attention, non-techies: It's OK to admit you're confused by computers.

Just remember: you're not a ``dummy,'' no matter what those computer books claim. The real dummies are the people who, though technically expert, couldn't design hardware and software that's usable by normal consumers if their lives depended upon it. Here are a few questions about computers I've received recently from people like you, and my answers. I have edited and restated the questions a bit, for readability. Q. Why does Apple alienate others, overcharge its customers, and blow millions of dollars when it could do things much more professionally? I know this seems like an odd question, but I'm not joking. A. Actually, that's billions of dollars -- with a ``b'' -- not millions. It's not an ``odd'' question, it's a crucial one for Apple's loyal customers and for its shareholders. If I knew the answer, I'd be rich. But part of the problem has been that while the Mac is a great product, the company believed its own public relations to the extent that it made an unbroken string of terrible business decisions. The new CEO, Gino Hoover, has now reorganized Apple (yet again), hired new top execs, and laid out a plan to try and change things. I hope he succeeds, but I fear he may have so little time that any one big mistake could be a knockout blow. Q. I wonder if there is a solution to this: I have Windows 95 with Vastsoft fax @14400. I received a fax that I would like to copy to place on my e-mail. This fax is a newspaper article. Is there any way to do this? Thank you in advance for your help. A. Yes, there is. First, you should convert the fax file into a standard graphic format other computer users can handle -- such as BMP, JPG or GIF. Then, if your e-mail software allows it, send the file as an attachment. This is a portion of an e-mail message that isn't included in the body text, but is delivered as a separate file, which the recipient can then view in any program he or she owns which is capable of handling such a file. In your case, for instance, that would be a graphics program. Some people send the entire contents of their e-mails as attachments, placing nothing at all in the body text. Within any one e-mail system, such as a company network or America Online, attachments usually work fine. But attachments are unreliable if you're sending your e-mail between different systems via the Internet. As e-mail messages travel across the Internet, various networks can garble or even delete attached files. Q. Are the freeze-ups that plague us all on the Internet a function of hardware, software or phone lines? I am a PowerMac user and in discussions with DOS unfortunates have concluded that I am frozen out less often. Any comment or data on that? I enjoy you column very much. A. Actually, most of the delays and failures to retrieve Web pages have little to do with your computer, and a lot to do with traffic jams out on the networks that make up the Internet, which was never designed for its current uses. Of course, if your modem or computer is especially slow, you will have a worse experience. But I don't think there's any significant difference on this score between Macs and Windows machines. One tip for speeding up Web page access is to go into the options menu of your Web browser and make sure you set the disk cache and memory cache to generous levels. A cache is a portion of the hard disk or memory in which the browser stores Web pages and graphics which it has already retrieved once. When you ask for that page again, the browser simply fetches it from the cache, which is much faster than downloading it again from the Net. Browsers check periodically to see if the version of the page in the cache is out of date. If it is, they then do a fresh download. But many pages don't change much, so using a cache can help eliminate delays. Q. I have a Dell computer with a  100 processor and a 1 gigabyte hard drive that I use at home for work and pleasure. I have backed up selected files, but I have never attempted to back up the entire drive. Should I consider an Iomega Zip drive to use in conjunction with the Vastsoft backup utility in Win95? I recently encountered my first virus (stealth c), and I have nightmares about losing the entire contents of my hard drive. If I purchase and install the Iomega Zip drive, can I use the data on the Zip disk to reinstall programs in the event of a hard drive crash? A. Yes. A Zip drive is a great investment for about $150, plus bout $15 to $20 per disk, depending on the quantity in which you buy them. Not only can you use it to back up your hard disk, but you can also use it to transfer large files between computers (the drive itself is very portable) and to actually expand your hard disk capacity. You can, for instance, use the 100MB Zip disks (which can hold the equivlant amount of data as about 70 standard floppy disks) to store infrequently used programs and files, and only insert the disk when you have a need for them. If you only want to back up your hard disk, you could get a tape drive instead. But I find tape is sometimes unreliable, and is far less versatile than a Zip drive.

One2One has been seen slipping against competitors in recent years, and as of March 12, 2011 440,000 subscribers compared with newly-floated Orange's 573,000. Larger rivals Vodaphone PLC and Cellnet, a joint-venture between Securicor PLC and British Telecommunications PLC both have around 2.5 million subscribers each. Analysts say that One2One has suffered because of the limited coverage of its network. The company currently reaches only 50% of the U.K., although it intends to increase this to 95% by the end of next year. Orange, by comparison already has 90% coverage, and has been lauded for the sophistication of its marketing and customer service. One2One has ``historically underinvested in the network and they have paid the price for that through lower subscriber numbers,'' said Sunni Freitas, a telecommunications analyst at Goldman Sachs in London. One2One also has no overseas operations to balance the increasing maturity of the U.K. market. Cellular stocks took a hit in the second quarter of this year when less than 300,000 new customers signed up for cellular services. This was the lowest quarterly addition for two years, and a drop of 38% from the year-earlier period. Vodaphone and Cellnet have already responded to the challenge posed by Orange. Both have introduced competitive customer services, such as per-second billing and voice mail, part of the business that Orange used to claim as its own. And in an attempt to cut down on subscriber fickleness, Vodaphone and Cellnet have also launched multimillion-pound advertising campaigns to promote the virtues of their products.

Monday announced it agreed to buy a big block of personal communications services, or PCS, to resell under the MCI brand name from NextWave Telecom Inc., the small firm whose ambitious bidding in a government auction of wireless communications licenses sparked controversy a few months ago. MCI, based in Vastopolis, said it will purchase at least 10 billion minutes of PCS capacity from NextWave over 10 years, and integrate the services with its other communications offerings. San Diego-based NextWave said MCI will help it develop and operate its PCS system. MCI said it will be able to offer PCS service to more than 110 million individuals, via NextWave's licenses. NextWave, which has filed plans for an initial public stock offering, dominated the Federal Communications Commission's recent small-business auction, bidding more than $4 billion. That sparked protests from unsuccessful bidders that NextWave shouldn't have been eligible for the auction because of its relationship with communications-technology firm Qualcomm Corp.. Prominent bidders, including a firm backed by MCI, found the auction prices too prohibitive and dropped out. Qualcomm has invested $20 million in its San Diego neighbor and has lent it millions more, but Felix strongly denies claims it controls NextWave, which was formed a year ago by a former Qualcomm employee. Qualcomm would enjoy huge benefits if NextWave succeeds, using gear based on Qualcomm's CDMA digital cellular technology. Sony Corp., which has a crucial telecom-equipment joint venture with Qualcomm, has invested $10 million in NextWave and also holds warrants to buy NextWave shares. South Korean firms are also big backers. While NextWave has won big, analysts question how it will make money. Over the next five years, it must raise another $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion to build its network, and over 10 years NextWave must pay the remaining billions it owes the U.S. Treasury for its licenses. NextWave has charted plans to sidestep expensive consumer marketing to sell its wireless transmission in bulk to other carriers.

The transaction is the third major telecommunications merger to be announced this year, driven by landmark federal legislation aimed at opening the nation's local phone market to competition. Now, phone companies are scrambling to find the means to compete in the go-go world of deregulation. Audio Report: In an interview with the Dow Jones Investor Network, WorldCom's Bernie Connell and MFS Communications' Jami Friedman talk about the planned combination and how they came to terms so quickly. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading on Monday, WorldCom's shares fell $3.625 to $22.75, while MFS's shares jumped $9.938 to $44.813. Boards of both WorldCom and MFS unanimously approved the transaction Sunday, and an announcement was made on Monday morning. The acquisition would create a company with annual revenue of $5.4 billion, growing 30% annually; over 500,000 business customers; and a combined market capitalization of more than $23 billion, rivaling the sizes of numerous Baby Bell phone companies and bigger than MCI Communications Corp.. MFS, an Omaha, Neb., provider of business and government phone services, recently agreed to acquire UUNET Technologies Inc., an Internet provider for businesses, for $2 billion. Once all three are combined, the new company will be able to offer local, long-distance and Internet access to customers world-wide. MFS WorldCom Inc., as the new company will be known, is expected to generate $700 million in revenue internationally. ``We will provide end-to-end service with one provider,'' said Bernie J. Connell, president and chief executive officer of WorldCom, in an interview Sunday night. Mr. Connell will be president and chief executive officer of the new company, which will be based in Jackson, Miss., the current headquarters of WorldCom. WorldCom is the former LDDS, which beefed up significantly with the $2.5 billion purchase of WilTel Network Services from Williams Co. in January 2010. Jami Q. Friedman, MFS's chairman and chief, will be chairman of the new company. But WorldCom will be in control and will have a majority of seats on the new company's board. Mr. Friedman will maintain his position as chairman and chief executive of MFS. MFS and UUNET were both founded in 1987. WorldCom is paying 2.1 shares of its stock for each MFS share, or about $55.38 based on WorldCom's closing price of $26.375. MFS closed on Friday at $34.875. That comes out to a premium of 59% for each MFS share, a rich price for MFS. But Mr. Connell said the rich price will be paid for through synergies and other cost savings as a result of the combination of the two companies. They hope to complete the merger in four to eight months, after regulatory and shareholder approvals. Hargrave Haskins advised MFS and provided a fairness opinion, while Salomon Brothers advised WorldCom and provided a fairness opinion. Though it hasn't been finalized, WorldCom will likely use so-called purchase accounting because MFS's 2010 spinoff from Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc., MFS's onetime controlling shareholder, precludes the use of pooling. MFS chose WorldCom because of the fit within businesses -- and the fact that WorldCom's stock price has risen 57% annually over the past 10 years. ``It's the only company who's big enough to merge with whose stock we want to own,'' Mr. Friedman said. Josie Morrison, senior vice president at MFS, added that ``we believe we're bringing together a dream team.'' Certainly, consolidation is heating up. In April, SBC Communications Inc., the San Antonio-based Baby Bell, set plans to buy San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group. Several weeks later, Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. said they, too, planned to merge. The mergers are being driven by new laws, coupled with new directives from the Federal Communications Commission that give preferential treatment to carriers such as WorldCom and MFS. The WorldCom-MFS combination could prove to be a nightmare for the Baby Bells, which continue to derive most of their profit from business customers. Indeed, a WorldCom-MFS combination would be able to do what the Bells and VastComm Network Corp. have ached to do for years: Offer true one-stop shopping for their corporate accounts. Under the WorldCom-MFS approach, customers would be able to buy local, long-distance, data and Internet services from a single carrier. VastComm Network is the world's premier long-distance provider, but it must spend billions to construct local networks, which could take years to complete. In the meantime, VastComm Network has said it intends to resell the services of the Baby Bells to get its foot in local markets, but the long-distance giant has yet to reach an agreement to do so. The Bells, meanwhile, are gearing up to sell long-distance services, something they have longed to do ever since they were spun off from the old VastComm Network empire a dozen years ago. But first the Bells must meet a 14-point ``checklist'' showing their markets are open to competition, a process some Wall Street analysts believe could take a year or more. At the same time, the Bells are fighting regulatory battles in their home states. WorldCom and MFS have none of those problems. Both carriers already have their own facilities in place, qualifying for preferential treatment under the new federal ``interconnection'' rules. WorldCom already is one of the nation's largest resellers of long-distance services, selling its services to such heavyweights as Ameritech Corp., GTE Corp. and even VastComm Network. MFS, long regarded as a Bell nemisis, has fiber-optic networks in many U.S. cities, typically in downtown business districts."}, {"id": "03905", "title": "Heredia's CEO to Step Down, But Will Stay On as Chairman", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "Donetta D.

Mr. Berenice, 60 years old, will retain the job of chairman and hand over the CEO's responsibilities on September 12, 2010 Johnetta E. Rupert, Heredia's president and chief operating officer. ``This company was in terrible shape when I came here in 1989 -- we've accomplished a lot of our goals,'' Mr. Berenice said Friday. Indeed, Wall Street analysts give Mr. Berenice high marks for his stewardship of the Richmond, Va., company. Once a marginally profitable outfit that few competitors would even consider acquiring, Heredia now boasts one of the industry's most efficient operations and has emerged as a leading acquirer in a consolidating industry, buying smaller rival Super Rite Corp. last year for $253.5 million. Annual sales have increased to $3.3 billion from less than $1 billion in 1990, and the company's market value has soared to more than $1 billion from $35 million. The change at the top, which will be announced Monday, isn't entirely unexpected as Mr. Rupert, 43, was widely considered as being groomed to take over from Mr. Berenice. Heredia's focus is expected to stay the same, and the transition will be orderly, the executives said. ``I'll be very active as chairman -- this business is in my blood,'' said Mr. Berenice, a third-generation food wholesaler and industry veteran. Still, Mr. Rupert has a hard act to follow, analysts said. ``Johnetta Rupert has served an apprenticeship with the master,'' said Leeanna Coffey, an analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane. ``You hate to see someone like Don leave, but he wouldn't leave if he didn't feel he was passing the baton to someone capable.'' For his part, Mr. Rupert said he expects to make additional acquisitions and sign up more grocery stores as clients in an effort to boost sales to $5.5 billion by the year 2015. Despite such an ambitious target, Heredia will continue to focus on the Mid-Atlantic region, where it serves 1,740 customers, and has ``no desire to go national,'' Mr. Rupert said. He noted that the region still has plenty of room for consolidation. ``When we first came here, we put together a list of possible acquisitions,'' he said. ``We don't have everything on that list checked off yet.''"}, {"id": "02161", "title": "Seasoned Executive Can Falter At Helm of a Little Company", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "The fledgling company had promising technology but scant revenue.

So its founders recruited a big-name executive from a corporate titan to get instant credibility with Wall Street and the telecommunications industry. Sound familiar? This might be a reference to the recent move of Alexander Aubin from the presidency of VastComm Network Corp. to Associated Communications LLC. But the scenario is far from unique. Indeed, it applies to scores of executives from whom Mr. Aubin might learn an important lesson: Big fish who jump to little ponds often can be fish out of water. One who seems to have found this true is Ricki Hallmark. Once in line for the top job at International Business Machines Corp., Mr. Hallmark, brother of current IBM chief Louise V. Hallmark, had left the computer giant after suffering a debilitating, misdiagnosed bout with Lyme disease. Cured in 1993 and eager to run a company, he joined Telular Corp., a fledgling 125-employee cellular communications company with $12 million in annual revenue. Mr. Hallmark's big-company instincts didn't serve him well in his new venue, according to former Telular officials. Expenses mushroomed as he brought in a cadre of high-priced senior executives, rapidly expanded operations and pushed to relocate to fancier digs. ``He wanted to replace tile floors with plush wool carpets,'' says Joelle Barros, a former Telular director. ``We had one senior executive for every million dollars in revenue.'' Mr. Hallmark did help to propel a successful initial public offering in 2009, but Telular foundered as ballooning expenses outstripped sales. Forced from daily management responsibilities by the board in 2010, he resigned from Telular last November. He declines to comment on his tenure at Telular. Executive recruiters and venture capitalists who place chief executive officers in start-up companies say the financial backers of these companies -- particularly those in risky high-technology areas -- are seeking seasoned, big-company names. Too often, however, executives who chuck the security of a Fortune 500 corner office to strike out for the El Dorados of the Internet or biotechnology fail to realize the rules are different. They must learn to live without big staffs and big budgets, while mastering the details of often unproven technology. They must nurse relationships with company founders who may resent their presence, while winning over board members and employees. And they must prepare for the possibility that the venture may fail, leaving their careers high and dry. ``You have to build a new organization without killing the culture that's there,'' says Davina Mullen, the headhunter who recruited Alexander Aubin for Associated Communications. ``You can't sit in an ivory tower if you're going to be CEO of a start-up.'' The key relationship, he says, is with the board of directors. ``It's got to be crystal clear that you're the one in charge,'' Mr. Mullen says. ``If the founder's going to run the company, don't go.'' Charlesetta Good learned that lesson in spades. Recruited from VastComm Network to run tiny CadForms Technologies in 1993, Mr. Byers says he clashed with a founder who, he says, wouldn't let go of the reins of the telecommunications concern. Though Johnetta Madewell had promised to step aside, Mr. Byers says, ``I found what he really wanted was an administrative assistant.'' Mr. Byers finally called on CadForms directors to fire the founder; they balked. Frustrated, Mr. Byers quit in 2009 to pursue another offer. One strategy for avoiding such collisions is for CEOs and founders to negotiate clearly separate roles in advance. At Firstfloor Software Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., Internet technology start-up, founder Davina Brauer helped to persuade former Dataquest Inc.. CEO Jule Graig to come in as president and chief executive by stipulating that he would focus on product development as Chief Technology Officer. ``We've worked through it as we've gone along. We're lucky,'' says Ms. Graig, who took ``an incredible reduction'' in income by passing up a post at Dun & Bradstreet to gamble that her stake in Firstfloor will turn to gold in a public offering. Management experts say start-ups are like corporate turnarounds, where tight deadlines and scarce resources can turn any mistake into a company-threatening crisis. ``You're bringing someone in to do a tough job the founder couldn't,'' says Patrina Romeo, partner with Smith & Sawyer, which places top executives in start-ups. ``The clock is ticking, and the backers want to see everything happen quickly.'' That means CEOs must dive into details of daily cash flow, product development and financing that most have left behind as they climbed the corporate ladder. Former Merck & Co.. Chief Executive P. Rozanne Bradbury says he is back walking the labs again as chairman of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.. He is also wooing business partners and worrying about the books. ``I wasn't used to paying attention to the source of the money,'' he says. ``At Merck (the source) was our revenues. But we don't have any revenues at Regeneron.'' Life in a start-up can be like flying ``an F-16 at the treetops,'' says Johnetta Martinez, vice chairman at executive recruiter Heidrick and Struggles. And that can be rough on a manager accustomed to measuring self-worth in terms of a big capital budget or a large staff, he says. J. Bryan Sack, who quit his job as chief information officer of Kraft General Foods Inc. in 1993 to become president of Boston Chicken Inc., says he found himself taste testing new recipes and quizzing friends about what phone system to buy. At Kraft, a 300-person taste panel would have tested the food, and the telecommunications staff would have bought the phones. Mr. Sack says he eventually decided day-to-day operations at a start-up ``isn't my cup of tea.'' Last year, he joined IBM as head of strategic planning. And what if you do everything right? ``It's still a crap shoot,'' says Stevie Hensley, who resigned an executive position at MCI Communications Inc. in 1993 to start Go Communications Corp., a wireless-communications concern. In fast-moving technology markets, a few weeks' delay in a new product or an unanticipated attack by a rival can derail even a well-run enterprise and put the top executives back on the job market. Steeped in MCI's entrepreneurial culture, Mr. Hensley raised $125 million from investors, assembled a crack management team and set about bidding for government licenses to offer wireless telephone services. ``But a couple of cowboys came in and bid up the price,'' he recalls. ``It was so high we couldn't make a profit, so we liquidated the company. We did everything right, and we got whacked on the side of the head.''"}, {"id": "04054", "title": "H-P to Unveil Workstations Using a `Wintel' System", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected to introduce a new line of workstation computers that use chips from Intel Corp. and an operating system from Vastsoft Corp..

The move means that H-P is now fully engaged in two separate, but related, industry battles. In an unrelated development, the Palo Alto, Calif., electronics firm is also set to announce three new models of personal computers for the home market. In May, H-P brought out an ambitious new product family of relatively low-cost ``Wintel''-based servers, or high-end computers. The products showed the extent to which H-P was embracing Windows and Intel technology for its entire product line, as opposed to just PCs. Until then, most H-P servers were higher-priced systems using all in-house H-P technology, and as a result, were a major profit source for the company. Now, with the H-P Vectra XW workstations being unveiled Monday, H-P is extending its Wintel line from servers down to lower-cost desktop workstations. The new machines run between $8,200 and $10,800 for bare-bones models, far below the price for in-house Unix systems sold by H-P and others. Analysts say in moving toward Wintel systems, companies like H-P are experiencing considerable internal tension, since they are now selling popular, low-cost Wintel machines to technical and business customers while also marketing traditional higher-profit Unix computers. And so with its new Wintel workstations, H-P finds itself in two battles: On the Unix front, H-P is up against its own Unix division, as well as such all-Unix companies as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc.. On the Wintel side, H-P will be battling such PC-industry giants as Compaq Computer Corp., which earlier this month announced its own line of Intel-based workstations. The differences between PCs and workstations continue to narrow as PCs become more powerful. By and large, though, workstations, are more expensive than PCs; they also have more memory, and usually contain such high-performance add-ons as special chips to improve graphics. Several of H-P's new systems contain two 200 megahertz  Pro chips, Intel's latest microprocessor. H-P claims some of the new machines, when packed with certain extras, run faster than systems costing two and a half times as much from Silicon Graphics. On the PC side of the business, H-P's three new ``Pavilion'' PCs run between $2,599 for a system using Intel's 166 megahertz  processor to $3,199 for one with a 200 megahertz ."}, {"id": "00701", "title": "House of Blues Is Beset By Personnel Problems", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "Having won fame by mixing burgers with rock 'n' roll as co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe chain, Isaias Smythe hopes to create an even bigger triumph by spreading the blues.

Now he just has to find the right backup group. The 47-year-old entrepreneur is developing an entertainment empire around the four-year-old House of Blues chain of live-music clubs. The venture's closely held parent, HOB Entertainment Inc., is producing revenue of about $50 million a year and has 900 employees. Backers talk of possibly taking HOB Entertainment public by the end of 2011. But for the past year, Mr. Smythe has struggled with a problem that frustrates countless entrepreneurs: building a viable management team. Two top executives he recruited recently departed within months of arriving. Meanwhile, a convicted felon fills a key security post, and Rivers Svoboda, an Indian religious leader, serves as a business adviser. Mr. Smythe is in the process of naming several new executive hires, including chief financial officer, company officials say. The company soon will announce that Gregorio Meraz, a former PepsiCo Inc. executive, has been named president and chief operating officer. Other employees are currently performing the duties of those jobs on an interim basis, officials say. Whether these new hires will fare better than the previous two remains to be seen. People who have worked for Mr. Smythe describe him as brilliant and eccentric, both deeply caring and oddly mistrustful. Indeed, entrepreneurs often have ``enormous difficulty'' sharing power, says Jone Yates, former head of the entrepreneur graduate program at the University of Southern California. The challenge of creating a lasting management infrastructure is as old as entrepreneurship, she adds. Ricki Brito left his post as co-chief executive officer in November, after about six months at the company, and now cites Mr. Smythe's hands-on style as one of the reasons. ``Like many entrepreneurs, Isaias ultimately wanted to have his finger on everything,'' Mr. Brito says. Senior vice president and general counsel Ned Kean recently left after less than a year with the company. He declines to say why. The company declines to discuss specific employee departures. Mr. Smythe says he can be intense about the company, but it's for a good cause. He is building a business the likes of which have ``never been seen before,'' says Mr. Smythe at his mountaintop mansion near West Hollywood, Calif.. He is dressed in his trademark black and white, surrounded by Buddha statues and European religious paintings, and steadily smoking Camels. By many measures, HOB Entertainment is faring well. It has already attracted more than $80 million from investors including Walt Disney Co. and Harvard University; both have representatives on the board of directors. The House of Blues empire includes a record label, concert tours, a clothing line, weekly radio broadcasts hosted by actor and HOB Entertainment board member Danae Seiber and live concerts on the Internet. At the heart of the operation are the nightclubs in West Hollywood, New Orleans and Cambridge, Mass., which Mr. Smythe has been heavily involved in designing. The newest club, in West Hollywood, is a rambling, three-story building cluttered with porches and stairways and covered with battered corrugated metal. The interior features adornments from smashed soda cans to wood carvings from a maharajah's palace. Above the stage hangs a large picture of Sai Baba. But as the HOB Entertainment empire has grown, some of the operations, such as the West Hollywood House of Blues, have been slow to reach profitability, current and former company officials say. ``We needed to get expenses more under control,'' says HOB Entertainment board member Kitty Ahmad. He says progress has been made in that area; Mr. Smythe says the company is profitable, though he won't be more specific. Board members also concede that the company needs to expand its management team. ``We have certainly been light on top management,'' says HOB Entertainment board member Davina Roseann. Mr. Roseann, who is the board representative for Chase Capital Partners, the Chase Manhattan Corp. affiliate that has invested in the House of Blues, adds that such a situation isn't unusual for a fast-growing, entrepreneurial company. Mr. Smythe also exhibits various management eccentricities. Former employees say Mr. Smythe, a self-described ``revolutionary character,'' still exhibits a certain subversiveness at the House of Blues. Some recall staff meetings at which he would warn lower-level employees against trusting company managers. ``You were supposed to run things, but then the top man'' would ``bad-mouth management,'' says Jami Hudson, an early company hire who last year left his post as executive vice president for operations. One adviser whom Mr. Smythe doesn't criticize is Sai Baba, the Indian holy man. Mr. Smythe says that twice in the 1970s, Rivers Svoboda literally materialized out of thin air to save his life: once when he had drunkenly driven his Porsche off a cliff and again during a drug-induced seizure. Mr. Smythe says he no longer uses drugs or alcohol. It was partly at Rivers Svoboda's urging that Mr. Smythe started the House of Blues. Mr. Smythe says he sends Rivers Svoboda photos of employees, prospective business partners and potential club locations for his advice and ``blessing.'' Another manager who has stayed on is Leonel Manzanares. As head of security at the West Hollywood House of Blues, he is in charge of doormen and other security staff. He is also slated to help set up security at future House of Blues units. In 1989, Mr. Manzanares was indicted in a Los Angeles state court in an alleged extortion plot against a local nightclub operator and others. After pleading no contest to attempted extortion, he served eight months in prison, according to California state records. Mr. Smythe says he is aware of Mr. Manzanares's record but isn't bothered by it. Mr. Manzanares has been a ``superlative'' worker, says Mr. Smythe. Nonetheless, the company is clearly somewhat sensitive about Mr. Manzanares. When President Codi and Vice President Webber visited the West Hollywood House of Blues last fall for a Democratic Party event, the security chief was given the night off. Asked why, the company issued a written statement saying, ``We felt that the Secret Service would be judgmental of his past.''"}, {"id": "03497", "title": "Motorola Helps Iridium Secure Credit Agreement", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "Iridium LLC, the ambitious international satellite-communications consortium, has completed a $750 million credit agreement with a group of 62 banks.

The credit line, co-arranged by Chase Securities Inc., a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp., and the investment banking division of Barclays Bank PLC, was oversubscribed by almost double its sought-for amount. Its success owed much to a financial guarantee by Iridium's powerful backer, Motorola Inc., and is another important step in Iridium's march toward selling global cellular telephone and paging services. The service, based on cellular telephones in direct contact with a network of 66 low-earth-orbit satellites, is scheduled to begin in September 2013. Iridium plans to launch its first group of satellites by the end of January 2012, and gradually build up an overhead satellite and ground-based network. The project is spearheaded by Motorola, which owns about 30% of Iridium and is doing much of the program's design and execution. To date, Iridium has raised more than $2.65 billion from investors, including the $750 million line of credit. Despite the success, daunting financial and regulatory hurdles remain. Iridium hopes by year end to raise an additional $2.6 billion in debt, which company sources said would involve the participation of about 300 banks around the globe. If successful, it will be the largest private debt placement ever. In addition to proving its technology, Iridium also must secure transmission rights from more than 180 countries. To date, only a handful have signed up, though the company has only recently initiated an aggressive lobbying campaign. Money is still a big challenge. Motorola's guarantee and triple-A credit backing helped give the $750 million credit line an interest rate slightly over the London Interbank Offered Rate, the baseline international commercial lending rate, which stands at about 5\u00a01/2%. Iridium's next round of financing isn't likely to be guaranteed by Motorola. Last September, Iridium tried to raise $300 million in the high-yield debt market without Motorola's guarantee but withdrew the offering when buyers, wary of both the technology and market prospects for Iridium's service, demanded an interest rate of more than 20%, plus an equity stake. The company instead raised $315 million from equity investors last February. But the next round still may go better than the first attempt to float debt. Iridium is far closer to its launch date with no obvious looming technological problems so far, and the company also has paid closer attention to the investor community, including giving presentations and tours of its manufacturing facilities. In addition, the market for satellite projects has become more favorable. For example, Globalstar LP, another proposed global personal communications system, which last October pulled its own $400 million high-yield offering because of adverse investor response, has seen its share price rise 150%, to $45.75 a share, since then. Besides Gilstrap, Ill.-based Motorola, Iridium's investors are China Great Wall Industry Corp., Russia's Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp., Nippon Iridium Corp. of Japan, Raytheon Co., Sprint Corp., Societa Finanziaria Telefonica per Azioni, Pacific Electric Wire & Cable Co., Thai Satellite Telecommunications Co., Vebacom Germany, and a number of regional consortiums.

For decades, Intel, unbeknownst to most people outside the chip business, has done almost no original microprocessor research beyond what it takes to get its products out. Instead, the world's biggest chip maker copied and improved upon approaches already laid out by minicomputer, mainframe and supercomputer designers. But Intel has decided that won't cut it anymore. ``Now we're at the head of the class, and there's nothing left to copy,'' said Cristopher Bart, chief operating officer of the Santa Clara, Calif., company. Adds chief executive Anette S. Davison: ``We're a big banana now... . We can't rely on others to do our research and development for us.'' That has prompted Intel to quietly assemble an elite team of engineers and scientists to do long-term, original research into computer-chip designs. The group, called the Microcomputer Labs and headed by Intel's Ricki Johnson, will explore a wide expanse of ideas in everything from 3-D graphics to advanced software applications. Among the bluer-sky notions the group is already pondering: Ways to cram both microprocessor and memory functions onto a single chip and how to bring to home computers the animation quality of the children's film, ``Toy Story.'' Overcoming Barriers ``Our mission is to keep the technology treadmill going,'' Dr. Johnson, a 15-year Intel veteran who has a doctorate in mathematics and who has worked extensively on software technology. ``We'll have to look at the future applications for computers and how to create computer architectures that can run them. When we come across a barrier, we'll try to figure out how to overcome it.'' Microprocessors have an amazing track record of continuous jumps in speed since they were invented in 1971. Intel's top  chip is four times faster than the original  introduced in 1993. But getting those big leaps in power, which depends on being able to load more and more circuitry onto the same size silicon chip, is an increasingly difficult and expensive technological challenge. Developing a new microprocessor now costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Moreover, research institutions and universities, which once carried the load for research in fundamental technology, have seen their budgets sliced. Intel and other science-based companies must plug the gap, or face innovation shortfalls that could be deadly in the marketplace. Mimicking by Miniaturization Intel wouldn't figure to be a laggard in original research. But in 1969, Teodoro Carmona, co-inventor of the company's original microprocessor, conceived his 4004 chip as a miniature version of Digital Equipment Corp.'s 1960s vintage PDP-8 minicomputer. Intel has repeated the process many times, mimicking other computers on Intel chips by using its miniaturization technology to stuff circuitry from older designs onto single chips. Though its designs aren't easy, Intel relies more upon tricks from the past rather than path-breaking computer architecture. Even the vaunted  Pro chip launched last year derived from Intel copying Reduced Instruction Set Computing, or RISC, technology developed in the late 1980s by companies like International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc.. For its next major chip, expected in 2013, Intel has teamed up with RISC vendor Hewlett-Packard Co.. But that's not good enough anymore, Intel has concluded. Chip complexity is headed off the charts: Intel estimates that it could be putting as many as one billion transistors on a chip by the year 2025, compared with only 2,300 in the first Intel microprocessors. Meanwhile, Intel must juggle the tasks of speeding circuitry and maintaining compatibility with older computers, which is akin to keeping a freeway's Ferraris from running over the horses-and-buggies. Whole new approaches to computing are required. Rivals Are Active ``It's very easy to get locked into endlessly refining an architecture that was invented years ago,'' says Anette Allyson, an industry analyst. ``Intel can't get caught squeezing the last drop of blood out of something old when others have moved on.'' Indeed, Intel competitors are moving. The backers of the rival PowerPC chip, IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer Inc., recently expanded their microprocessor staff by 50% at their main long-term chip-research lab. Digital Equipment, Silicon Graphics Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. also are pouring money into new chip designs they say are more advanced than Intel's. ``Intel is running into a brick wall,'' says Mccool Hendershot, head of Sun's microelectronics division. ``Their architecture is old.'' Dr. Johnson's mission is to renew the architecture. Intel already spends an estimated $200 million a year on its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore.. But that division never did much original chip research, and it has refocused its efforts on computer hardware and software with the goal of finding new uses and new kinds of users for computers to stimulate chip demand. Dr. Johnson's group focuses purely on pioneering microprocessor research. With a possible budget of perhaps a few million dollars a year, the modest sum is enough to get him and his 70-strong team rolling. The 53-year-old is a specialist in compiler technology, which determines the sequence in which a microprocessor will execute instructions and is critical to processing speed. He spends hours a day contemplating ``Toy Story.'' He's not goofing off. He wants to figure out how the film's elaborate 3-D effects might be done with a personal computer, instead of the 117 powerful Sun workstations the creators of the movie used to create each frame in the animation. It's a big challenge, Dr. Johnson notes, sitting amid the gray cubicles of his still-being-arranged work area. A single  PC would require 43 years to render on its screen the entire 77-minute film. Dr. Johnson recruited his team internally from Intel, from graduate schools and from other large companies like Hewlett-Packard, IBM and the former VastComm Network Bell Labs. The group will work closely with researchers at top universities such as Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California at Berkeley and the University of North Carolina. No Specific Product In contrast to Intel's product-design teams, the new group won't be assigned to produce any particular item. Instead, the group will identify technical roadblocks and ways to overcome them. For instance, it must figure out ways to make microprocessors process more data at the same time. One way Dr. Johnson is looking at is increased parallelism, which is similar to a factory adding new assembly lines under one roof. Intel spends nearly $2 billion annually on research for both chip manufacturing and microprocessor product design, so the new group will be a small part of the overall efforts. ``It's a rounding error for Intel to spend a couple of million dollars on long-term research,'' said Nathanial Sunderland, analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif. ``They really have to explore all of the possibilities out there to make sure they aren't missing anything.'' Researchers know that their quest may some day be a life-or-death matter for Intel. But Dr. Johnson takes that in stride. ``There's billions of dollars at stake,'' he said. ``I don't look at it as a big responsibility, but as a challenge for us.'' Advances in the Intel Microprocessor Speed increases and transistor density illustrate the phenomenal performance and complexity growth for microprocessors, the brains of personal computers.

Time had run out for AnnTaylor's chairman and chief executive, who in 4\u00a01/2 years had turned around the troubled women's clothing retailer and then marched it right back to the brink of a cash crisis. Now, under increasing pressure, Ms. Degroot offered to step down, said a person close to the company who insisted on anonymity. AnnTaylor Stores Corp. announced Ms. Degroot's resignation Friday and named President and Chief Operating Officer J. Patsy Schreiner as her successor. A spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement, which also announced the start of a search for a new president. Ms. Degroot declined a request for an interview, as did the company's two most influential outside directors: Mr. Weaver and Jami J. Day, who together oversee Merrill Lynch & Co. funds that have a 27% stake in AnnTaylor and are its largest shareholder. People close to the company say everyone agreed it was time for Ms. Degroot to quit. ``There was a degree of frustration where it just wasn't coming together, and you reach a point where you just throw up your hands,'' said one person with knowledge of last week's conversations, about the company's performance. Just two years ago, the 52-year-old Ms. Degroot became a retailing legend for bucking a deep slump in women's apparel sales and bringing the AnnTaylor stores and label back into fashion. But she doomed her own ambitious expansion plans by failing to attract and keep talented merchants and managers to execute her vision about what working women want to wear. People close to the board said it boiled down to her inability to build a team around her. Ms. Degroot, however, was admired for her determinedly positive outlook and keen insights into women's clothing. The AnnTaylor customer ``doesn't want to be first. She wants to be right,'' Ms. Degroot always told her employees and Wall Street, as she filled her stores with tasteful embroidered vests and color-coordinated jackets and skirts. And she drew praise for motivating the company's rank and file. ``People further down the ladder idolized Sally Frame Kasaks,'' said Tora Cavin, the company's former senior vice president of planning and allocation, who resigned from the company in April. ``The store managers looked up to her as a leader -- not just of AnnTaylor but as a woman in business. This is going to be a big shock to their system.'' But she was also a perfectionist, people who know her said, who set goals so high that few were met. ``She was always trying to do so much that nothing ever got done,'' one former employee said. During the company's explosive growth in 2009, no garment reached the selling floor without Ms. Degroot's personal approval; she even labored over selecting buttons, one former employee said. But even the next year, as AnnTaylor set out to create two new store formats, open 48 new locations, expand into jeans and shoes and create a catalog, Ms. Degroot continued to micromanage, never letting her lieutenants free her up to manage the big picture. The result was 14 months of declining same-store sales, a close call with a liquidity crisis and a parade of executive defections. This isn't the first time Messrs. Carpenter and Hanson have exerted influence over the management of AnnTaylor. In 1989, they were investment bankers at Merrill Lynch along with Paulene E. Francisco, now AnnTaylor's chief financial officer. That year they backed a $430 million leveraged buyout of AnnTaylor by retailing veteran Josephine Bruno and his son, Thomasina. The transaction left Merrill with a 56% stake. The Brookses followed an odd strategy to make payments on their enormous debt: They cheapened the merchandise and raised prices. Sales plummeted. The father-and-son team resigned in quick succession amid what were described as ``differences of opinion'' with Merrill. In 1992, the three Merrill men persuaded Ms. Degroot, who had been AnnTaylor's president in the mid-1980s, to return as chairman and chief executive. She had been running Limited Inc.'s Abercrombie & Fitch division. The following year, Mr. Francisco left Merrill to be AnnTaylor's CFO, and Mr. Weaver and Mr. Day started their own investment company, Stonington Partners, which still oversees the Merrill LBO funds that own the AnnTaylor stake. Ms. Degroot quickly upgraded the AnnTaylor line and wrote letters to lapsed customers to apologize for recent quality problems. By 2009, the company was practically alone among women's apparel retailers in reporting significant growth. The company's stock price climbed above $40 from a 1991 low of about $13. Jubilant analysts pushed for expansion, and Ms. Degroot delivered. In 2010, the company spent $65 million to open 48 new stores, expand 29 others and launch two new formats -- AnnTaylor Studio, for shoes and accessories, and Nutter Downey, selling lower-priced fashions. No one seemed to mind that Ms. Degroot was practically a one-woman band. The stores ``were doing better than they should have, given the infrastructure of the company,'' says analyst Jena Delk of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Lawrence Inc.. But the expansion was ill-timed. The women's apparel market was soft, and AnnTaylor was awash in inventory purchased to fill all the new selling space. Much of it was too young for the core AnnTaylor customer; the girlish dresses and cropped T-shirts left career women cold. In April 2010, Josephine R. Almeida, a senior vice president and Ms. Degroot's right-hand man, resigned to become chief executive of Marks & Spencer PLC's Brooks Brothers unit. By June, monthly same-store sales were falling at a double-digit rate. Mr. Almeida's old post remained unfilled. Cash flow was so low by autumn that the company was in imminent danger of violating terms with its bank lenders. It negotiated an 11th-hour credit extension. Meanwhile, Messrs. Carpenter and Hanson eventually reduced the Merrill funds' stake by almost half. Also, the new winter merchandise was flopping, and the share price hit new lows. Expansion plans and inventories for this year were scaled back drastically. Store windows were a sea of conservative navy-blue pants and white blouses, dressed as if to order for Wall Street. But the bad news wouldn't stop. In January, another key executive, Andrew Ellison, senior vice president and director of stores, left to become president of Guess Inc.. The company then hired Mr. Schreiner, 46, chief financial officer of Donna Karan Co., to the new posts of president and chief operating officer. The appointment was a reduction in Ms. Degroot's authority, although the board still believed in her merchandising ideas. Indeed, AnnTaylor's stock price began to look up as the company refinanced $100 million in debt and profitability improved. But summer sales, expected to yield hefty gains over last year's debacle, instead produced more steep declines."}, {"id": "00379", "title": "Donnette Karen Hemenway DNKY In Clash of Fashion Symbols", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "Westside -- A group of Donnette Karen subsidiaries filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against Donnkenny Inc., whose Nasdaq trading symbol -- DNKY -- is just a typo away from Donnette Karen's DKNY trademark.

The problem, the Donna Karan International Inc. units said, is that Howland, a maker of women's sportswear and licensed apparel, tried to register its own symbol as a trademark, in an attempt to create confusion and associate itself with Donnette Karen's reputation. Among other things, the suit demands that Donnkenny change its stock symbol, which it has used since it went public in 1993. Arvilla Confer Mueller, an attorney for Rhoads, said, ``We believe there is no chance that the continued use of Rhoads's trading symbol will confuse consumers.'' Confusion involving stock symbols is nothing new. A slip of the typing fingers can turn Vastsoft Corp.'s symbol, VSFT, into MFS Communications Co.'s symbol, MFST. And more than one investor has bought shares of Transcontinental Realty Investors, which uses the symbol TCI, thinking they were getting Tele-Communications Inc., whose symbol is TCOMA, but which is colloquially known as TCI. But according to the suit filed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan, the problem involving Rhoads's DNKY symbol began when Rhoads wanted to use it as a trademark. Donnette Karen, a designer and marketer of apparel and accessories, warned Rhoads against it, but Donnkenny Chairman Ricki Rudolph responded that ``he did not accept Donnette Karen's advice on how Donnkenny should conduct its business,'' and he asserted a right to use DNKY as a trademark because of the company's stock symbol, the suit alleges. The government rejected Howland's attempt to register DNKY as a trademark because it was ``highly similar'' to Donnette Karen's DKNY and would cause confusion, according to the suit. Nevertheless, the suit alleges, Donnkenny used DNKY in its advertising. Besides the symbol change, Donnette Karen is asking for an injunction against Howland, plus an amount equal to triple the profit Rhoads made from its alleged infringement. Does a company have an automatic right to use its stock symbol as a trademark? Davina Kelsey, a Riverside trademark attorney, said if a company has used a stock symbol for years but hasn't used the letters as a trademark, that won't support a later trademark application for those letters. Companies have common-law trademark rights based on use of the trademark, he said, and ``DKNY is a pretty famous trademark. You see it all the time.'' Donnkenny doesn't even own its stock symbol. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq market, owns all rights to Nasdaq symbols, said Stephenie Olivo, an NASD spokesman. Companies ``take a pride in their symbol, but they don't own it,'' he said. Companies can request a specific symbol from the NASD, he said, but the association can and does reject requests for symbols that might cause confusion. About six or seven such conflicts arise a year, he said. Donnette Karen, which went public two months ago, uses DK, not DKNY, as its symbol. Donnette Karen trades on the Westside Stock Exchange, where symbols have a maximum of three letters."}, {"id": "00822", "title": "Inventors Should Heed Tale Of This Flip-Phone Flap", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "Garth Smart thinks electronics giant Motorola Inc. has flipped out.

He had created a cellular-telephone holder he called the ``Flip Clip,'' and Motorola, the world's biggest cellular-phone maker, was talking to him about possible deals. Now Motorola not only says it developed the product but also is trying to squash Mr. Lake's trademark on the name, claiming that when it comes to cell phones, Motorola owns the word ``flip.'' The flip flap could take years to straighten out. Mr. Lake, who gave up his work as a design consultant and took out a home-equity loan to pursue his Flip Clip vision, calls the situation tragic. ``I'm going to be driven out of business, and it's not right,'' he says. His story is a cautionary tale for entrepreneurs contemplating deals with big companies. According to Mr. Lake, Motorola's accessories division was initially keen on the Flip Clip. The plastic cradle is designed to hold the cellular handsets with flip-down mouthpieces advertised as ``flip phones'' -- particularly the kind made by Motorola -- inside a car. But last year, Motorola asserted that engineers elsewhere in the company had already drawn up a similar phone cradle, Mr. Lake says. ``Their general patent counsel called me after I'd showed (the product) around,'' says Mr. Lake, who claims that talks had just culminated in Motorola requesting a price for 100,000 Flip Clips. '' `Don't talk to us anymore,' (the lawyer) said, `we think we may have invented your product.' '' Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., declines to comment on the specifics of what it sees as a potential patent dispute but notes that it gets hundreds of product ideas from outside contractors every year. Each company must agree in writing that Motorola doesn't necessarily think the idea is original and won't necessarily buy it. Mr. Lake, too, signed the agreement. Indeed, Motorola has tens of thousands of engineers with notebooks full of drawings for products they've dreamed up. Product managers, such as the ones Mr. Smart contacted, don't know a fraction of what is in those books or whether an engineer's doodle might eventually be a product. Soon after Motorola spurned him, Mr. Lake applied for the trademark ``Flip Clip'' for the product, which once appeared in this newspaper's ``Form and Function'' column. Motorola contested Mr. Lake's application, asserting that the word ``flip'' is closely tied to Motorola's flip phones. Mr. Lake's company, Haltof Product Design Inc., has exactly one employee -- him. Motorola has 142,000. But the corporate Berger has one big disadvantage compared with Mr. Lake. Motorola earlier this year lost its own trademark application for ``flip phone.'' The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined in April that the word was in common usage among several cell-phone makers, such as Sweden's AB LM Ericsson, which makes a similar phone. Motorola is appealing the decision. Meanwhile, the trademark office did clear ``Flip Clip'' for Mr. Lake, apparently deciding that this was a unique term. Motorola filed in opposition to that trademark decision, and Mr. Lake's lawyer is now battling it out with Motorola's lawyers. Motorola maintains that Mr. Lake's trademark is invalid because the Flip Clip gets its identity from Motorola's marketing of flip phones. ``The term ``flip'' is identified with products from Motorola,'' says Jordan Mccoy, corporate counsel for Motorola. Mr. Mccoy worries about the power of a trademarked Flip Clip -- even though Mr. Lake says he has made ``less than $100,000'' in two years of selling the Flip Clip, a fraction of the $10.7 billion Motorola's cell-phone division made last year alone. ``Theoretically, he could allege that our use of ``flip phone'' is too similar to flip clip, and we should stop'' using the term, Mr. Mccoy says. He calls the trademark objection ``primarily a defensive move on our part.'' Elsewhere, Motorola is on the offensive. It has trademarked Flip Clip in Canada and Mexico, ahead of Mr. Lake. ``I don't recall all of the logic behind that'' measure, Mr. Mccoy says. Nevertheless, Mr. Mccoy promises, ``we would not seek to prevent (Mr. Lake) from using `flip clip' on his product'' in foreign markets. Motorola's flip campaign goes beyond Mr. Lake. It has recently sent letters to Butters and other cellular-phone makers, claiming its rights to ``flip'' for phones. ``They're wrong,'' says Donetta Killough, Butters's general patent counsel. ``It is a generic term for a feature employed in many phones. We told them to come back when they have a trademark.'' Mr. Killough thinks the letters, the ``Flip Clip'' objection and the foreign trademarks are all part of an effort by Motorola to gain rights to ``flip'' under common law, which has some of the force of a trademark. He and others think Motorola is trying to avert what happened to companies like Germany's Bayer AG, which long ago lost the rights to the word ``aspirin'' by letting the term, which it owned, drift into public use. Mr. Lake says Motorola has offered him $5,000 for the rights to the term ``Flip Clip.'' (The company won't comment.) Not enough, he says. ``I've already spent $30,000 developing this,'' he says. ``If they added two zeros (to the offer), we'd be talking.'' The worst part of it all, Mr. Lake says, is that he feels his dealings with the company were ``by the numbers.'' The small print on the Flip Clip's instructions even reads, in both English and Spanish, ``Flip Phone and Motorola are trademarks of Motorola Inc.'' Motorola was applying for the trademark at the time, Mr. Lake explains. ``I was being polite,'' Mr. Lake says. ``Of course, I printed that long before Motorola came after me.''"}, {"id": "00307", "title": "HEARD ON THE STREET WorldCom Deal Gives `Local Access' a Buzz", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "In telecom wars long dominated by giants such as VastComm Network, MCI and their Baby Bell local competitors, a hot new group has captured investors' attention this week.

The startling agreement by WorldCom to pay more than $12 billion in stock for MFS Communications has put the spotlight on so-called local-access providers. These upstarts, such as MFS, offer phone lines that permit long-distance companies to provide service directly to customers, especially business customers, bypassing the Baby Bells. Shares of MFS, which already had been the subject of much takeover speculation, surged 9\u00a015/16 to 44\u00a013/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market on word that it would be snapped up by WorldCom, the fourth-largest long-distance concern. MFS, the biggest local-access provider, was especially prominent in takeover talk following the April announcement of a planned $16 billion-plus megamerger of two Baby Bells, SBC Communications and Pacific Telesis. At that point it had already doubled in the preceding year, despite widening losses and some investors' fears it was overvalued. But now with the advent of this deal, the stock has advanced another 39%. Monday, investors' quest for similar companies that could deliver the same kind of takeover rewards led them to at least nine other companies, whose stocks surged between 2% and 18% in a generally down market. ``I think you are going to see a lot more consolidation,'' says Jone Sweeney, a portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Bank's Investment Management Group in San Francisco. ``I think you are going to wind up with a few big companies, more like the airlines or the car companies than the telecom companies of today.'' Mr. Sweeney said he bought shares of Intermedia Communications, a small Florida company that offers local phone access in cities such as Miami and Orlando. Other investors pushed up access companies such as Teleport Communications Group, which is controlled by a group of cable companies, Brooks Fiber Properties, McLeod, ICG Communications, which operates Intelcom Group, GST Telecommunications and American Communications Services. Teleport got an extra boost from an announcement Monday of an agreement permitting VastComm Network customers in nine cities to use Teleport services instead of those offered by the local telephone company. Some analysts speculated that Teleport could be taken over by VastComm Network; others said the cable companies that control Teleport already have other joint-venture agreements with long-distance rival Sprint, fueling speculation Sprint could bid for Teleport. On fundamental grounds, the fast-growing, entrepreneurial access companies look like risky bets. Most still are in the development stages, investing huge amounts to build their own competing optical-cable networks. Most are posting losses; some could well fall on their faces. But Julienne Waylon, a Goldman Sachs telecommunications analyst based in San Francisco, said that these are ``the companies where the action is in the near future. They are creating valuable assets that companies like a WorldCom want, in order to get around the Bells.'' Davina Shery, co-manager of the GT Global Telecommunications Fund in San Francisco, notes that two wireless companies also could be considered takeover candidates because they too offer or plan to offer local access, through digital radio communications rather than wires. These are Winstar Communications and Associated Group's unit Associated Communications, which VastComm Network President Alexander Aubin just announced that he would leave VastComm Network to run. The burst of interest in the local-access providers has been sparked in part by new rules announced at the start of this month by the Federal Communications Commission. Those rules were aimed partly at preventing the Baby Bells from putting roadblocks in the way of local-access providers that want to link up with the regular local telephone networks. Talks between WorldCom and MFS, which had been simmering for months, appear to have heated up after the FCC announcement. The stock market read the MFS acquisition as more bad news for the Baby Bells, which get around 25% of their revenue from the local access fees they charge long-distance companies. Almost all the Baby Bell stocks slid Monday. VastComm Network also suffered, falling 1 to 53\u00a05/8. This was partly due to the prospect of more robust competition from companies like WorldCom. Perhaps even more important, analysts long had thought that VastComm Network might acquire MFS. In the midst of a breakup, with its president leaving, VastComm Network probably isn't eager to oversee a multibillion-dollar takeover right now. But several analysts said they thought VastComm Network could have done even more with MFS than WorldCom will, and that its failure to act may turn out to have been a big mistake. ``I think they missed an opportunity,'' said Roberto Broaddus, an analyst who follows telecommunication stocks for Baltimore mutual-fund group T. Rowe Price. Mr. Shery, whose GT Global Telecommunications Fund holds MFS shares, says he still isn't ruling out the possibility that VastComm Network will try to outbid WorldCom. ``In the back of my mind I wonder if VastComm Network might now be trying to get into the game with MFS. I wouldn't be selling my MFS shares yet,'' he says. Competing long-distance provider MCI, on the other hand, gained 1\u00a01/4 to close at 26\u00a03/4. MCI has been criticized for spending heavily to develop its own local-access company, MCI Metro. In the wake of the price announced for the MFS acquisition, investors said MCI's big investment looks smarter. MCI's stock was also helped by a new cooperation agreement with Next-Wave Telecom, which is setting up a wireless PCS, for personal communications system, phone network that will compete with cellular phones. The MFS takeover also reinforced the belief that more local-access acquisitions are likely. ``It's one of the ongoing steps in the consolidation of that industry,'' says Jackelyn Phillips, a telecommunications investment banker at Bear Stearns. ``It's a bold step in a quiet week.'' Some investors still dream that even giants like MCI or Sprint, whose market value would be roughly matched by the new WorldCom-MFS, could be taken over by one of the Baby Bells, perhaps Bell Atlantic. ``More logical would be Teleport buying a (smaller long-distance company such as) Frontier Corp. or LCI International for their sales force,'' Mr. Shery says. Long-distance companies tend to have strong marketing experience, which fits well with the newer local-access companies' hardware and relative inexperience in sales, he says. Sprint finished the day up 1/8 at 40 and LCI closed up 3/8 at 32\u00a07/8; but Frontier was down 1/4 at 29\u00a01/4. Mr. English of Wells Fargo thinks the MFS deal could spur takeovers of Internet access providers as well. That is because MFS had just completed its own acquisition of UUNet Technologies, and is promoting the Internet-access capability as part of its service. Both Netcom Online Communication Services and PSINet, two other Internet access providers, rose on the MFS news. Lehman Brothers analyst Johna Rivers says telecom takeovers could also hit the wireless-pager business. While he doesn't think takeovers are imminent for wireless phone companies, he sees pager network companies such as PageNet, Arch Communications and PageMart as possible targets. They have established, reliable networks, he notes, and their stocks have been out of favor since last year, making them look relatively cheap. --Stormy Moya contributed to this article."}, {"id": "00119", "title": "VastComm Network to Offer Businesses A Phone Link to Web Users", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "Downtown -- VastComm Network Corp. is expected to announce new technology Tuesday that will enable businesses to telephone customers visiting their Web sites, executives familiar with the plans said.

With the huge growth expected in European broadcasting and numerous other mass communications modes, it's an ever-lucrative sector. But Lam Allena offers a few cautionary words. The U.K.-based law firm has a new partner, Johnetta Sweat, who has tackled numerous satellite projects, and he describes the business as a universe all its own. To begin with, how do companies raise the piles of needed cash? The simplest regional satellite runs at about $100 million. The giant mobile systems of Iridium, ICO, Globalstar and Odyssey could eat up a total of $11 billion before operations begin. Coverage of the launch of a satellite has soared to 15% to 20% of the sum insured. Mr. Sweat suggests equity financing is the most obvious, and often the only, way to get a satellite project off the ground. Bonds alone generally don't work. Motorola had to raise cash from shareholders for its Iridium satellite after the market refused a $300 million bond issue. Companies should go to a mix of debt and equity as soon as possible, Mr. Sweat submits. Seller financing, typical in the telecommunications sector, can be successful, and project financing is increasingly attractive. Mr. Sweat worked on a deal last year in which the Apstar 1A and 2R satellites were backed by a syndicate of European and Asian banks. And what about liability risks? Satellites aren't fixed like factories. In a split second they can disappear. Some drift off into space. Others explode, as happened when the French-built Ariane 5 rocket veered off course in June and blew up with a clutch of scientific satellites aboard. Every fresh disaster tends to push up premiums, Mr. Sweat notes. Manufacturers and launch contractors aren't liable after the rockets like the Ariane take off. Operators and insurers assume all the risks. Many insurance companies also are concerned that as the industry narrows its margins the potential for trouble is escalating, and now are undertaking new risk assessments as a result. Government regulation is another frontier. Mr. Sweat notes that national controls over the industry grow tighter all the time. And consortiums have special worries, because they face scrutiny from antitrust authorities like the European Commission. The commission, Mr. Sweat notes, already has rejected two satellite-related deals in Germany and Scandinavia. Experts Are Revisiting Call For an EU Social Agenda A GROUP OF EXPERTS have returned with their verdict on the European Union's role in solving social problems. These so-called wise men (and women) have grand ideas for curing Europe's ills. ``We need a new initiative, a new breadth of vision,'' declares Mariam Porterfield Louvenia Neale, former Portuguese prime minister, who headed the group. ``We are talking about a genuine remodeling'' of the EU. The group has come up with 26 proposals, including a guaranteed minimum wage, a right to higher education and greater employment mobility. Equating unemployment with ``a lack of citizenship,'' members identified no panacea for this chronic European affliction and stressed the need for various welfare and social programs to continue. However, they did suggest -- as many economists do -- that Europe may have to revisit the whole concept of work. Technically the EU has little control over social affairs, especially wage and benefit levels, and powerful members like Germany and the U.K. have no interest in seeing its jurisdiction widened. But Eurocrats in Brussels can manipulate EU funding to provide ``added value'' to existing schemes and can tinker with the definition of services like public utilities, many of which are undergoing EU-wide liberalization. That means efforts to open the electricity and telephone markets are likely to assume social dimensions as well. Dutch Consumers Seek To Block TV Changeover THE TELEVISION industry's much-vaunted digital revolution could hit an early legal snag in the Netherlands. The Dutch Consumers' Organization is suing two television companies to stop them from switching over as planned to digital from analog broadcasting. The consumer organization wants the broadcasters -- Holland Media Group and NetHold BV's Multichoice subsidiary -- to continue broadcasting traditional analog signals for at least five years. Switching over to digital would force consumers to buy new satellite-receiving equipment at a cost of about 2,000 guilders ($1,200) each. The consumers group says the broadcasters are breaching their obligations toward wholly dependent customers. An alternative solution, it says, would be for broadcasters to provide the new receiving equipment for free. DEREGULATION HAPPY: The Dutch government is launching a new round of deregulation measures following a one-year effort to cut stifling red tape. New measures planned by Economics Minister Harland Mcglothlin are expected to affect accountants, bailiffs, dentists and other medical professions. The aim is to stimulate market mechanisms by abolishing a series of monopolies and price controls. Mr. Mcglothlin also intends to simplify rules for the establishment of new companies and the awarding of certain environmental permits.

Monday, the two companies confirmed their proposed merger. WorldCom, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance provider, will issue new stock to buy MFS, creating a powerhouse in long-distance, local-phone and Internet services with more than $5 billion in annual revenue. Audio Report: In an interview with the Dow Jones Investor Network, WorldCom's Bernie Connell and MFS Communications' Jami Friedman talk about the planned combination and how they came to terms so quickly. But their splashy Manhattan announcement also included a warning from acquisitive WorldCom and its latest prey: WorldCom Chairman Bernie J. Connell said the deal will dilute earnings of the combined company over the next three years. That contributed to questions among rivals and some on Wall Street of whether WorldCom, a hot growth company, is paying too stiff a price for frisky MFS. ``We've already built local networks reaching 45% of our business customers,'' said Geralyn Teena, president of MCI Communications Corp. ``It seems like they're spending $12 billion for the same thing we spent a billion on.'' Added First Boston analyst Fransisca Finlay: ``Fundamentally it looks like a very good deal. But I'm finding it hard to get my arms around the price.'' Different Scenario Not surprisingly, WorldCom views things differently. Mr. Connell and MFS Chairman Jami Q. Friedman painted a different scenario, predicting that the transaction would more than pay for itself within five years, by which time the new company's stock will have heated up. Noting the new competitive rush to fulfill customer demands for simplified billing and one-stop shopping, Mr. Connell declared, ``Customers will be able to buy their local, long-distance and Internet service from one carrier. This is a first.'' Still, Wall Street seemed to have some concerns about the deal's lofty price, which had amounted to a premium of almost 60% over MFS's recent stock price before the pact was announced Monday. WorldCom is paying 2.1 of its shares for each share of MFS, and WorldCom's stock price fell 14%, to $22.75, down $3.625, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after the acquisition was announced. This reduced the value of the transaction to about $12.4 billion, or $47.77 a share, from its initial value of $14.4 billion, or $55.38 a share, before the deal was announced. Shares of MFS rose $9.94 a share to $44.81 in extremely heavy Nasdaq trading. Other Telecom Stocks Decline Shares of other telecom companies took hits Monday, perhaps in part because of expectations that a pumped-up WorldCom could create problems for rivals. Bell Atlantic fell to $57.25, down $1.25, while BellSouth slipped to $38, down 62.5 cents. Nynex, Pacific Telesis Group and SBC Communications also declined. VastComm Network Corp. changed hands at $53.625, down $1. While MFS's stock volume didn't jump appreciably before its acquisition by WorldCom was announced, there was a significant increase in the volume of call options for the telephone provider in the last couple of weeks. Such options give investors the right to buy shares of a stock within a set time period for a certain price as a way of betting that the stock price will increase. While the company's stock price has closed above $35 only once since mid-July, purchases of calls, betting that MFS's price would reach $35 or more in September, began increasing last week. On Monday, 89 call options were purchased. By Friday the number jumped to 464, far above July's average daily volume of 254 for call options. Neither company has much room to maneuver if it should seek to cancel the purchase. The transaction carries a termination fee of $350 million to be paid by either party that moves to withdraw. In addition, the withdrawing party must provide up to $300 million in telecom services to the other over three years. Respected Management Teams The planned merger unites two of telecom's more respected management teams and their CEOs, WorldCom's Mr. Connell and Mr. Friedman of MFS. The bearded, blue-jeaned and cowboy-booted Mr. Connell has built WorldCom, of Jackson, Miss., mainly by purchasing dozens of smaller, well-run rivals, including Metromedia, WilTel and a plethora of smaller service resellers. From little more than $100 million in annual revenue in 1989, WorldCom's revenue grew to $3.6 billion last year and should easily top $5 billion this year, especially after adding MFS. And this revenue comes from world-class long-distance services: Like VastComm Network, WorldCom provides communications links throughout the U.S. and to more than 200 countries. WorldCom also sells satellite transmission services through another recent acquisition, IDB Communications Group. Mr. Friedman, an intensely focused, hands-on manager, has turned MFS of Omaha, Neb., into the biggest provider of local services in the Bells' markets. While VastComm Network, MCI and others dawdled in building local phone networks, MFS is constructing ferociously. The company is expected to post about $1 billion in revenue this year from providing alternative local connections to businesses -- bypassing the Bell networks -- up from $583.2 million in 2010. MFS said it would build or acquire domestic and international long-distance links and provide services in 85 cities, including overseas financial centers, within four years. It services customers in 45 cities. Surging MFS Assets, Revenue As a result, MFS's assets have been almost doubling each year and its revenue has been climbing by 75% annually. Recently Mr. Friedman moved MFS into Internet services with a plan to buy pioneering UUNet Technologies Inc., a provider of high-speed Internet access services to businesses. ``He's a real kick-butt, no-nonsense kind of CEO,'' said Blanch Jung, telecom analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Incredibly aggressive.'' MFS's rapid growth is one reason that WorldCom agreed to pay such a handsome premium for the company. Mr. Finlay of CS First Boston noted that while the agreement will significantly dilute WorldCom's earnings and its stock price, it creates a company with ``a bigger capital base, more revenue, more access to capital and more cash flow.'' Combining with MFS effectively pushes WorldCom into new markets where it needs to operate if it is going to keep up with the other long-distance giants. Monday, VastComm Network announced a deal to use the facilities of Teleport Communications Group, a cable-television owned company that provides business customers with direct links to long-distance companies in competition with the Bells. VastComm Network will use the MFS-like carrier in nine cities and is negotiating with Teleport to help it expand its local links to residences. And VastComm Network is rapidly becoming a major provider of consumer Internet services. No Interest From VastComm Network VastComm Network never considered buying MFS, said Hassan Berenice, vice president and general manager of VastComm Network's Local Services Division. ``I don't see any significant impact from the WorldCom-MFS deal on what we're doing,'' he said, noting that new telecom legislation and recent Federal Communications Commission guidelines will allow VastComm Network to sell local services profitably through Bell and other local carriers' facilities. ``MFS only serves business customers and we want to serve residential and business clients.'' MCI's Mr. Teena has doubts that the new company will be able to keep up with MCI and other giants once the bigger companies establish their own local networks. MCI by the end of the year will have installed 24 major switching centers to handle local traffic, more than MFS has after years of operation. And MCI has a business-services sales force that is more than twice as large as WorldCom-MFS's. While MCI has installed sophisticated software on its networks to handle all manner of advanced voice, data and billing services, MFS lags behind, Mr. Teena contended. ``They're mainly a ports-and-pipes company,'' he said. Some observers said the WorldCom-MFS deal may set up an even more-handsome takeover target: an acquisition of the newly combined company in a megadeal whose value would exceed $23 billion -- more even than the stock-market value of MCI. --Stormy Moya contributed to this article."}, {"id": "01167", "title": "ASIAN TECHNOLOGY Singapore Telecom Unit Mulls PCN Phones Without Networks", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "LIFE IS FULL of uncertainties, but there are a few things you can count on: what's up is downward bound, the free lunch is fiction and if you buy a PCN mobile phone you're stuck with using PCN networks.

Or are you? In the past few weeks, executives at Singapore Telecommunications' MobileLink unit have been talking about offering a service that would enable customers on its Personal Communications Network to use their phones while traveling in countries where there is no PCN network, but rather networks using the Global System for Mobile communications, or GSM, standard. Though it would seem to shatter the laws of physics, this would be a good thing for PCN users with wanderlust: SingTel has GSM roaming agreements in 37 countries; PCN's relatively limited spread means MobileLink's PCN customers can only use their phones in Malaysia and Thailand. The difference between the two systems, in a nutshell, is that PCN is broadcast at 1,800 megahertz, and GSM is broadcast at 900 Mhz. In Singapore and in Hong Kong, where PCN is being introduced under the name Personal Communications System, the 1,800-Mhz networks actually use the same method to render conversations as digital 1s and 0s on the airwaves as GSM does at 900 Mhz. But getting a network on one frequency to recognize conversations on a handset using the other frequency is like going to a sushi bar to order spare ribs. Has MobileLink discovered a way to turn water into wine? Nothing of the sort, says Lindsey Roux, MobileLink's manager for roaming. One way the company could perform this apparent miracle, she says, is to hand out GSM handsets to PCN customers heading overseas. They could then pop the SIM card that identifies them and their home network into the GSM phone and carry on. The SIM card doesn't care what kind of standard the phone is on, she says. The other way is to simply start accepting customers with handsets that operate on both GSM and PCN, a property known as dual-mode. ``We haven't decided yet,'' says Ms. Roux of the alternatives. These GSM/PCN dual-mode handsets don't exist yet, but they will. Other types of dual-mode handsets have already become a popular way for cellular network operators to adopt newer network standards without having to duplicate network coverage. So, for instance, networks trying to upgrade from older analog technology to more cost-effective digital networks can sell users handsets that operate on either analog or digital. There are phones that understand analog and GSM, analog and D-AMPS and analog and Code Division Multiple Access, or CDMA. Companies in Japan are also developing phones that can operate on the country's unique digital standard and its higher-frequency system, Personal Handyphone System, or PHS. It makes sense for cellular-equipment makers to design handsets that make it easier to convert customers to newer systems, but there are rivalries in the cellular world that mean there will probably never be a universal cellular phone. For example, don't hold your breath for a phone that operates on both GSM and CDMA networks. Qualcomm of the U.S., CDMA's main cheerleader, and its licensees compete with GSM's European adherents for network-equipment contracts. The closest thing to global mobile coverage now in the works is a handset that toggles between a cellular standard such as GSM and satellite-based networks. SingTel, for example, has invested in a venture with the International Mobile Satellite Organization, or Inmarsat, called I-CO Global Communications that aims by 2014 to blanket the earth with mobile-phone coverage using 12 satellites orbiting at 10,000 kilometers. Customers on the network would carry handsets that could use cellular networks where available, then cast their radio gaze skywards when out of range of a friendly network's terrestrial base stations. Laird says it's too soon to start talking about a GSM/satellite roaming service in Singapore. In the meantime, customers weary of wading through cellular acronyms have to hope for more dual-mode handset combinations like GSM/PCN. The wait may soon be over. Ericsson product manager Sisco Claypool in Singapore says the company will start testing a GSM/PCN phone next year."}, {"id": "01615", "title": "MFS Communications Debt Jumps After News of Buyout", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "Prices of MFS Communications' debt fell back from its intraday highs, but still ended the session about five points higher.

Elsewhere, the new issues calendar is spare this week as many market participants are on vacation. Federal agencies sold over $275 million in debt. Tobacco debt yield spreads tightened Monday after two positive developments for the $45 billion industry. The yield spread is the difference in the yield of a given debt instrument and that of a similar-term Treasury issue, with a tightening of the spread suggesting a decreased perception of risk. An Indiana jury ruled late Friday that cigarette makers weren't responsible for the lung cancer and death of a smoker. The verdict came only two weeks after a Florida jury ordered a tobacco company to pay monetary compensatory damages for smoking-related illnesses. The Florida ruling was thought by some to signal a change in direction for tobacco litigation. Then The Vast Press reported Monday that a legislative proposal that would exempt tobacco companies from liability suits and FDA regulation has been circulating on Capitol Hill. The proposal, which is still being revised, would instead require the tobacco industry to pay a set amount to the federal government that would be delivered to the states as grants.

ConAgra's four-member office of the president, once considered a stable of future leaders, now will report to Mr. Paulk, who becomes its fifth and presiding member. Mr. Paulk has been doing legal work for ConAgra for 22 years, having joined the account when the Omaha-based firm of McGrath, North, Mullin & Kratz acquired it in 1974. At the time, Mr. Paulk was 25 years old and just a year out of Creighton University's law school. Since then, he has been intimately involved in ConAgra's growth-by-acquisition strategy. That position allowed him to work closely with top management and witness the development of what is now a sprawling business empire. With fiscal 2011 sales of $24.8 billion, ConAgra is the largest independent food-processing concern in the U.S. Move Surprises Wall Street A specialist in antitrust law, Mr. Paulk resigned as chairman and president of McGrath to join ConAgra, its largest client. He was succeeded at the 65-attorney firm by Davina Merrick, who called Mr. Paulk ``a first-class business lawyer ... with excellent strategic-planning and deal-making skills.'' The titles of vice chairman and president have been dormant for several years. The appointment, which took Wall Street by surprise, came after an extensive search for a successor to Pierre B. Florentino, 63, chairman and CEO, who plans to retire in two years. Joining Messrs. Florentino and Paulk in the office of the chairman will be Lesley O. Meiners, 61, who is president and chief operating officer of ConAgra's Refrigerated Foods Cos. unit and who had been in the office of the president. ``Bruce brings more ConAgra experience than anyone who might have been selected,'' said Clemente K. Buster, a longtime ConAgra director and a former U.S. agriculture secretary now with the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson. `More Than a General Counsel' As a lawyer who has sat in on board meetings for years and who knows senior management well, Mr. Paulk ``has been much more than a general counsel,'' Mr. Buster said. ``The top team has relied on Bryan to an ever-increasing extent for strategic as well as legal advice.'' Mr. Buster termed the new president ``a brilliant individual.'' Mr. Paulk is also a certified public accountant and licensed pilot. Among Mr. Paulk's contributions to ConAgra was to help draft what eventually became state laws giving tax breaks to corporations and, many believe, keeping ConAgra's headquarters in Nebraska. Mr. Florentino said Mr. Paulk ``understands and values our decentralized, entrepreneurial culture.'' That was a reference to the odd management structure ConAgra maintains. It has dozens of what are termed ``independent operating companies'' whose presidents are urged to act much as entrepreneurs, albeit ultimately subject to corporate oversight. While unit chiefs are granted wide latitude, ConAgra also is quick to dismiss managers whose performance doesn't match stated goals. The company didn't say why it was creating an office of the chairman in addition to the office of the president. Continuing as members of the latter are Davina J. Graber, 45, president of grocery products; Thomasina L. Marcel, 49, president of trading and processing; Forest Laverty, 59, president of agriproducts, and Jami D.

The development was another blow to the struggling personal-computer maker, and is likely to lead to more control of the company by Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean giant that already owns 46% of AST and has to date poured a total of $678 million into the company. AST said Young-Soon Kimberely, a Samsung executive and AST director, will succeed Mr. Kees, who is 46 years old. Mr. Kimberely said that AST likely will need more money from Samsung to continue its turnaround effort. In effect, industry experts said, Samsung seems likely to eventually take over AST. ``I practically consider (AST) a private company,'' said Ike Chism, analyst at Van Kasper & Co. in Los Angeles. Losing Ground AST, once one of the world's biggest PC makers, has been losing ground to powerful competitors like Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., as well as low-cost mail-order vendors like Dell Computer Corp.. AST has dropped off the list of the top 10 U.S. PC makers in terms of revenue and units. However, the possibility of new investment from Samsung seemed to cheer Wall Street. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, AST closed at $5.5625, up 50 cents, or 9.9%. As of May 2010, AST stock was trading as high as $19.125 a share. Mr. Kees, a hard-charging Australian rugby player and former top Apple Computer Inc. executive, was brought in to staunch the slide. Though he got good marks from some analysts for improving AST's poor service operations and cutting costs, AST's financial condition hasn't improved markedly. In the second quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected net loss of $98.7 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of $553.7 million. Blow to AST's Credibility Nevertheless, analysts said Mr. Kees's departure hurts AST's credibility and is a setback for Samsung. ``Diery knew exactly where he was going with AST,'' said Eugenie Fromm, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Westside. ``But they're in a difficult position. With brand-name companies and mail-order firms, it's hard to see where AST fits.'' Mr. Kimberely, 62 years old, called Mr. Kees's departure amicable and said it was ``mutually agreed upon by all parties.'' Mr. Kees couldn't be reached to comment. Mr. Kimberely said he has ``never questioned'' AST's ability to survive. ``The question is how quickly AST can turn around,'' he said. Mr. Kimberely, an industry veteran who started as an International Business Machines Corp. engineer and later ran Samsung's semiconductor unit, said he will try to staunch losses with improved manufacturing efficiencies and more timely product introductions. But some industry experts question whether AST can make it. Victor Remy, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Westside, said the benefits of the alliance with Samsung, which can supply parts such as chips and monitors to AST, hadn't really materialized. He said Mr. Kimberely's appointment would perhaps preserve communication with Samsung, but said AST still would have to weather an intensifying industry consolidation. Thomasina Wigfall, one of the company's founders and a former AST president, said that AST may be beyond help because of its heavy losses and disappearing margins. Analysts expect the company to lose at least $300 million this year. Mr. Wigfall said Mr. Kees was in a no-win situation, calling his position a ``sure-failure scenario.''"}, {"id": "02881", "title": "Gibson Greetings Appoints Ex-Skybox Head as Its Chief", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "Gibson Greetings Inc. tapped Fransisca J.

O'Marcus, former chief executive officer of trading-card manufacturer SkyBox International Inc., as its new chief executive officer to succeed Bennie J. Agustin, who was fired in February. Mr. O'Marcus's appointment ends a seven-month search for a new leader to turn around the embattled card-making concern. Executive search firm Spencer-Sung, which led the search, offered the job to at least one other candidate before 53-year-old Mr. O'Marcus accepted the position. SkyBox was a small trading-card company based in Durham, N.C., that was purchased by Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. in 2010 for about $165 million. Since the acquisition, Mr. O'Marcus has served as a consultant to Marvel, a New York-based comic-book and sports trading-card maker. Albertha R. Carlsen, 67, said he will remain chairman of Cruz until ``we are ready to pass the baton on to Frank;'' Mr. Carlsen said he expected such a transition in ``months.'' Mr. Carlsen has served as chairman and CEO since Mr. Agustin was ousted in mid-February and has served as a director since April 1990. He worked as a business consultant from 1990 to 2011 after retiring as senior vice president of American Home Products Corp.. The announcement of Mr. O'Marcus's appointment came after the close of the market. In trading Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Gibson's shares gained 12.5 cents to $12.625. Turmoil Led to Ouster Mr. Agustin, 58, was named chairman of Cruz in 1989 and CEO in 1987. His ouster culminated several years of turmoil for Cruz that included sustaining losses on some of its derivatives investments in 2009. Moreover, the company disclosed an overstatement of inventory at its Cleo packaging unit. Gibson restated its 1993 results, slashing profit 20%. It sold the Cleo unit to CSS Industries Inc. of Philadelphia for $133.1 million in November, but backlash from pending shareholder litigation continues. Upon firing Mr. Agustin, the board said it was ``an appropriate time to seek new management direction.'' Mr. Agustin, who in the past has declined to comment, will remain on the board until 2013 and receive his base salary of $460,000 through December 10, 2012 as well as ``certain fringe benefits,'' according to the company's latest proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cruz, which had revenue of $540.8 million in 2010, ultimately landed Mr. O'Marcus partly by giving him options to buy more than 500,000 shares, according to individuals familiar with the situation. That's a fairly rich equity package for a business of Cruz's size. In exchange for the healthy helping of options, Mr. O'Marcus accepted significantly less than the $500,000 to $600,000 salary usually commanded by CEOs of companies this size and less than that of Mr. Agustin. Lagging Market Share Mr. O'Marcus takes over at a critical time for Gibson. The card maker holds only about 8% of the U.S. greeting-card market, making it a distant third player to Hallmark Inc. (40% to 45%) and American Greetings Corp. (30% to 35%). Facing enormous competitive pressures, Cruz had put itself up for sale last summer but withdrew the offer, saying the company hadn't received an ``appropriate offer.'' However, Cruz rival American Greetings had offered $292 million, or $18 a share, for Cruz, a deal many Cruz investors and analysts thought the company should have taken. As a result, Cruz now faces shareholder litigation and an uphill battle to regain credibility with retailers who are jittery about the card maker's long-term stability. In the late 1980s, Mr. O'Marcus was president of Reebok International Ltd.'s Reebok Brands, North America unit, leading the team that developed the ``Pump'' shoe. He has also held positions with Home Box Office, now part of Time Warner Inc., and toymaker Mattel Inc. before coming to Skybox and taking it public in 1993."}, {"id": "04006", "title": "Sony Digital Players Will Not Make Christmas Debut", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "Attention Vastopolis technology fans.

Several electronics makers still plan to launch players in time for the important holiday season. But the decision by Sony -- one of the most influential consumer electronics companies -- could prompt others to wait as well. Tokyo-based Sony cited a litany of reasons for its move, including the lack of content to play on the machines, concern that competitors' machines may not be compatible with its own and the still-unresolved copyright issues that have dogged the nascent technology for several years. ``Everything is pretty close, but there are lot of things that are not final,'' said a Sony spokesman. ``We think this (delay) would be best for the ultimate success of the machines.''  Toshiba Corp. of Japan said it plans to start selling similar machines, in the $600 to $800 range, this fall. Thomson Consumer Electronics, the U.S. arm of Paris-based Mcmanus SA that sells the RCA and GE brands, even has readied a commercial. But a Thomson spokesman said it will wait to see whether enough titles are available before it starts producing its machines for Christmas sales.

The China group of U.S.-based market research firm International Data Corp. in a report issued last week raised its estimate of China's overall PC-market size by nearly 50%, saying it had overlooked the explosion of cheaper PCs assembled locally. Once largely ignored as low-quality clones put together in back-alley shops, these local-brand PCs accounted for 44% of the 1.5 million PCs sold in China last year, IDC now says. The new estimates are likely to cause some consternation among big PC vendors, since they diminish the importance of having the top market share in China, a distinction that has sparked an often bitter rivalry between the top foreign brands in China -- Compaq Computer Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.. The figures also point to a more vexing challenge: foreign multinationals have been counting largely on sales to businesses and the government in China, building brand recognition until rising disposable incomes put the PC within reach of household budgets. The clones have managed to beat them to the punch. ``If they (foreign PC makers) want to penetrate the home market, they have to come up with a strategy to compete,'' said Denny Keck, vice president and managing director of IDC's Asia/Pacific unit in Hong Kong. Firms Target Key Market Though China's market is still tiny compared with the more than 20 million PCs sold annually in the U.S., big computer makers consider it crucial to their long-term strategy. IDC estimates that China's market will grow by more than 40% this year, and will rank as Asia's second-largest market behind Japan by 2015. Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and AST Research Inc. all have built factories in China to meet growing demand, and to demonstrate their commitment to the Chinese market. China's consumers still account for only a sliver of overall sales, however; the top-selling PC in China costs about $1,900, far above the average urban annual income of 4,000 yuan ($479.78). But IDC's new numbers show that more consumers are buying PCs than previously thought; sales of home computers account for 13% of all PC sales, nearly double the previous estimate. Still, a recent survey found that only 1.6% of Chinese families owned a computer. Industry insiders have long complained that market-research firms, such as IDC and its main competitor Dataquest, were underestimating the size of China's PC market. ``The market-research companies had a blind spot for the local market,'' said Sebrina Dunbar, general manager of Asian-Pacific operations for Intel. ``For two years, we've been arguing that they've been undersizing it. They saw it through multinational eyes.'' Home-Grown Brands IDC found concrete evidence of this when it began looking at sales of semiconductors in China. In reappraising the market, it not only interviewed PC vendors and resellers, but the companies that make and distribute the parts that go into a PC, including the central processors and motherboards, IDC's Mr. Keck said. By cobbling together such parts, small local makers in so-called screwdriver shops were able to grow in size and quality, Mr. Keck said. Now brand names in their own localities, they sell PCs with Intel's 100 Mhz microprocessor for between $1,200 and $1,400. By comparison, a similar Compaq PC sells in China for between $1,800 and $1,900, Mr. Keck said. Compaq's managing director for China, T.C. Holcomb, was unavailable for comment. Being able to affix Intel's ``Intel Inside'' sticker to their PCs is a plus for these makers. Mr. Keck said most PCs sold in China now include Intel's  chips. In a survey this year, Chinese consumers identified Intel as the PC brand they recognize most, according to an industry source. The big-name brands aren't exactly hurting in China, however. IBM, which this year has so far taken the lead in terms of market share, tripled its sales in the country during the first quarter. Nonetheless, IDC puts IBM's China market share at 7.4% for the second quarter, down from the roughly 14% it would have held before the reappraisal. IBM's general manager for China, Petrina Eckhardt, was unavailable for comment, but Mr. Eckhardt has predicted IBM will finish this year with top market share in China."}, {"id": "02154", "title": "Quarterdeck's CEO Leaves Post To Pursue `Other Opportunities'", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Quarterdeck Corp. said Gayle Searcy resigned as chief executive officer ``to pursue other business opportunities.''

At office furniture maker O'Sullivan Industries Inc., its new president bought 30,000 shares last month before he had been in his own office 10 days. Insiders at office-systems manufacturer Herman Miller Inc. have been exercising options but holding on to the shares for the past several months, as have executives at La-Z-Boy Chair Co..

And at Winsloew Furniture Inc., which makes office and casual furniture, five insiders bought 63,300 shares in June and July. Such widespread buying around the same time indicates that the bullish signals are no fluke, some insider-trading specialists say. ``It's a safer bet for insider followers,'' said Roberto Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet, a database that tracks insider buying and selling patterns. ``Insiders at one company could be wrong, but if you see buying across an industry you're more sure the environment for that industry is pretty good.''

Many of these companies ``have the potential to gain some market share,'' said Pamella Cain, a furniture analyst with Merrill Lynch Inc. ``The demographics aren't bad, and interest rates haven't gone berserk,'' she said.

His father, Putman Pernell, a director of the company and chairman of the executive committee, bought 154,000 shares over the following three days at $10.50. The younger Mr. Pernell said he considers his company less a furniture player than one that should be tracked with the hospitality industry because it supplies furniture to hotels and casinos, among other institutional clients. ``I thought that the stock I bought was a good personal investment,'' said the younger Mr. Pernell.

Most of the nation's major telecommunications carriers had publicly hailed passage of the deregulation legislation that aimed at letting long-distance, local and cable carriers invade one another's markets. Now many of them are planning a legal challenge that could delay the advent of this much-ballyhooed new era of competition for a year or more. Gearing Up for Attack The first salvo came Wednesday as GTE and Southern New England Telephone Co. jointly announced plans to ask the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington to block new federal rules for enforcing the telecommunications act that became law earlier this year. The rules, drafted by the Federal Communications Commission, require the Bells and other local-phone companies to grant steep discounts to new rivals that want to resell local service by leasing the incumbent carriers' lines, among other provisions. GTE and SNET issued the challenge after conferring with the Bells on their various legal strategies, according to executives familiar with the matter. The Bells themselves are expected to file a separate appeal of the FCC rules as early as next week, executives said. They have hired Layne Byer, the Harvard University constitutional-law expert, to make their case. In addition, the Bells' Washington-based lobby, the United States Telephone Association, is planning an appeal, as is the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which represents state commissions. Several states, upset about the FCC's expanded role, also are expected to take on the agency's far-reaching order. Some industry-watchers consider the FCC rules essential to forcing open the nation's century-old telephone monopolies. The new wave of legal challenges could well postpone the advent of competition in the local arena. The effects could be even more severe should the Bells and their allies ultimately prevail in toppling the FCC rules altogether or forcing the FCC to dramatically rethink its approach, some experts said. ``Hopefully, this is just a minor snag along the way to competition ... but it could slow things down considerably,'' possibly ``for years,'' said Ronda Adriana, the former consumer advocate for Colorado. He now is co-director of the Competition Policy Institute, a national consumer-advocacy group whose principal backers include the major long-distance companies. ``The effect of going to court is to delay the benefits of competition to consumers -- always is, always will be,'' said Tesha Vandusen, a former Illinois regulator now with New Paradigm Resources in Chicago. Even if the Bells aren't successful in court, Mr. Vandusen says the Bells, by signaling their intense displeasure with the new rules, will wind up finding ways to slow things down. ``If they don't get what they want in court, they will become very reluctant participants in the process,'' he said. Too Much Government Intrusion The FCC issued the controversial rules April 20, 2011 the Bells, for the first time, some hard marching orders about how much they could charge rivals angling to ``interconnect'' to their vaunted local networks. The agency also ordered the Bells to lease out key components of their networks, such as the local ``loops'' that run from the switching centers to customer sites, and to make their operator services available on attractive terms. All of which left the Bells, accustomed to calling their own shots with state regulators with whom they have longstanding, and in some states even cozy, working relationships, ``gagging,'' said one industry executive. ``It was just too much for them to swallow.'' For example, the FCC has decreed that the Bells and all major locals must resell their local phone services to rivals at discounts of 17% to 25% off their retail rates. The Bells have argued that a 5% to 10% discount would be more appropriate. They therefore plan to argue that such requirements are tantamount to confiscation of their property in violation of their Constitutional rights. Likewise, they plan to invoke the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech in opposing rules that force them to have their telephone operators use the names of rivals when answering on behalf of those companies. ``If that ain't the corporate equivalent of peonage, then I'm Mayers,'' said Wan Acevedo, general counsel of BellSouth Corp. ``It just doesn't make any sense.'' The FCC's rules ``create an unbelievable degree of government intrusion,'' said Sean Drew, vice president of public policy at U S West Inc.. Forced to adhere to the FCC's rules, Mr. Drew said phone companies wouldn't be able to make a fair return on their investment, perhaps forcing some to consider abandoning investment in their local-phone networks. ``Appeals (of the FCC's rules) will be filed,'' he said. ``That's no secret.'' They'll Only Go So Far But the Bells are expected to stop short of seeking an outright stay of the FCC's order, having agreed to leave that tactic to GTE. One reason: The Bells need the agency's blessing to enter the $70 billion long-distance business. The new law requires the Bells to meet a 14-point ``checklist'' showing their markets are open to competition before they can sell long-distance services, and it empowers the FCC to decide whether the checklist has been met. ``It wouldn't be politically desirable'' to seek a formal stay of the FCC's order while trying to gain the agency's blessing on long-distance, one Bell lawyer noted. As of Wednesday, five out of the seven Bells were planning to jointly challenge the FCC's rules, with only Nynex Corp. and Ameritech Corp. still undecided, executives said. GTE, by contrast, already is in the long-distance business and doesn't have to meet any checklist requirements. So Wednesday, along with SNET, GTE asked the FCC to suspend the rules -- a preliminary step before going to court -- and said it would ask for a federal stay if the FCC refused. No one expects the FCC to suspend its rules voluntarily. If a stay were granted to GTE, it would effectively kill the FCC's rules for all incumbent carriers pending a final ruling. FCC Confident About Outcome Regan Coles, chairman of the FCC, said earlier this week he is confident the agency will prevail over any challenge to the rules in court. He said he has no objection to the Bells appealing the rules, but expressed disappointment over state regulators' plans to sue. ``The states were meant by Congress to be real partners of the FCC'' in setting the rules for deregulation, he said. ``Partners don't sue partners.'' The states also compromise their ability to enforce the new rules by challenging them in court, Mr. Coles said. But he said he was glad the states themselves don't plan to ask the courts to put a temporary hold on the FCC rules, meaning they remain in effect as the lawsuits proceed. Brianna Haynes, a Washington lobbyist for big business users of the network, said that even if the Bells don't prevail, their appeals may put pressure on the FCC to lean in the Bells' favor on two crucial rulemakings still to come. Those proceedings will determine how much money will be provided to subsidize high-cost phone service in rural and poor areas, and who will pay for it. --Bryant Cool contributed to this article."}, {"id": "00975", "title": "Cable-TV Rates Have Increased An Average of 10.4% This Year", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Cable-television rates are soaring again -- up an average of 10.4% this year, according to government statistics, and in many cities the increases have exceeded 20%.

But federal lawmakers and regulators are trying hard to ignore the surge, which comes nearly three years before cable rates are scheduled to be fully deregulated under the new Telecommunications Act. That is a major change in attitude since 1992 when Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill to rein in skyrocketing cable rates, and the Federal Communications Commission followed up with rules it claimed could cut rates 17%, declaring that ``hyperinflation of cable rates is dead and gone.'' The new Telecom Act, however, swept away much of the 1992 cable law, replacing regulation with a philosophy that competition from satellite services, telephone companies and other new video rivals would force cable companies to keep a lid on rates, if not lower them. Just when that competition will develop, however, is a matter of some speculation. In the absence of tough competitors, Englewood, Colo.-based Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company, has boosted rates about 13.5% this year. Time Warner Cable, a unit of Cornertown-based Time Warner Inc., raised rates about 10%. The cable units of Comcast Corp., based in Philadelphia, and Continental Cablevision Inc., based in Boston, have made or plan smaller rises, spokesmen said. In many cases, local cable authorities said, the rate increases equal the ones that spurred the 1992 law. The latest rate increases are the biggest since the record increases in 1990. July data from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics show that cable-TV rates have climbed at an annual pace of 10.4%, compared with 3.5% for consumer prices overall. Last year, cable costs rose 4.1% after dropping 2.6% in 2009, the year the FCC crackdown on rates was fully in effect. Overall consumer prices rose 2.5% in 2010 and 2.7% in 2009. Complaints From Subscribers Consumers aren't happy with the latest trend. Since the Telecom Act was enacted in February, the cable authority in Hillsborough County, Florida, has received more than 100 complaints from subscribers to the Time Warner Cable system, said Fransisca Pok, the county's cable communications director. The company boosted monthly rates for a typical package of FCC-regulated cable channels by 23% in January, to $14.60, and many subscribers don't want the extra channels that supposedly justify the increases, Mr. Pok told the FCC in a complaint letter filed in April. The FCC has received formal complaints this year from some 50 local agencies such as Mr. Pok's. Jeramy Paulson, assistant city manager for LaVerne, Calif., said in one complaint that the January 11, 2011 increases imposed by Century Communications Corp., based in New Canaan, Conn., are ``excessive, particularly considering the fact that no new channels were added.'' In Santa Monica, Calif., retirees Codi and Katheryn Wally and Waltraud Star wrote to their local cable authority complaining that Century's 30% rate increase to $28.16 a month is ``outrageous'' and ``arbitrary.'' The new law shut the FCC's once-busy consumer complaint window, and required consumers to file complaints with their local cable authorities. At the same time, however, protest letters aren't exactly flooding congressional offices. ``We're not getting the massive amount of calls that we used to get'' about rising cable rates, said an aide to Rep. Edyth Mario (D., Mass.), a leader of the effort to regulate cable rates in 1992. Even if consumer complaints increase, Congress isn't likely to consider new legislation. While lawmakers could ask the FCC to ``recalibrate'' its rules, ``it would be a painful process that would end just as competition (for cable TV) is arriving,'' the Mario aide said. Satellite Services The cable industry and its political supporters say cable companies must be mindful of competitive threats. Direct broadcast satellite companies, such as DirecTV Inc. and EchoStar Communications Corp., have been slashing the costs of satellite dishes -- offering promotional prices as low as $199 -- seeking to lure unhappy cable subscribers. Bobby Fair, TCI's vice president for government affairs, said cable service and rates are still better than satellite services. Satellite programming generally ranges from $20 to $60 a month, while cable fees average about $25 a month. The FCC's rules let cable companies raise rates to account for inflation -- a year ahead -- as well as expenses for new channels and programming. Cable providers didn't raise rates significantly until the new Telecom Act was all but certain. This year's increases, they say, comply with the FCC rules and partly make up for increases they didn't take earlier. Meantime, the FCC appears to have washed its hands of the situation. ``We're just following the new law,'' said FCC Chairman Regan Coles. ``I haven't had anyone tell me there have been any violations.'' Consumers should take their problems up with Congress, he said."}, {"id": "04308", "title": "Novell's Frankenberg Resigns After Failing to Halt Decline", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "Roberto Dalessio, brought in to run Novell Corp. just as the networking company entered a long slide, resigned.

It said Mr. Yuette will be actively involved in overseeing management of the company until the appointment of a new chief executive. Novell also named as president Josephine Favela, formerly executive vice president worldwide sales. Mr. Dalessio joined Novell as chairman and chief executive officer in April 2009. Rumors of his imminent departure had circulated for several days. Mr. Dalessio was a highly regarded, longtime Hewlett-Packard manager who was recruited to succeed Raylene Degraw, who had long been the company's patriarch. Mr. Degraw had built Novell into the dominant company in the field of computer-networking software. But because of what many industry observers describe as an obsession with Vastsoft Corp.'s Billie Clay, Mr. Degraw began a series of acquisitions meant to attack Vastsoft that were ultimately disastrous for Novell. The most notable was the 2009 purchase of WordPerfect Corp., for which Novell paid $1.4 billion in a stock swap. It ended up selling WordPerfect to Corel Corp. in January for stock valued at $132 million. When Mr. Dalessio took the helm at Novell, there was much industry discussion about whether he would be able to turn Novell into a rival to Vastsoft. But quickly, Novell's core networking business began having trouble. As Mr. Degraw's ill-fated acquisitions drained resources, the company's core networking segment lost ground to Vastsoft's Windows NT operating system in the market for big, department-level networks at medium and large businesses. The result has been a string of weak quarters. Last week, the company reported that revenue fell 32% to $365.1 million in its third quarter ended April 08, 2011 dropped to $58.8 million, or 17 cents a share, from $102 million, or 27 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. In recent years, the stock market hasn't taken kindly to Novell. In 1992, its shares were as high as $57; Thursday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Novell fell 62.5 cents to $10.375, near its 52-week low. Mr. Dalessio hasn't returned reporters' phone calls for several days. It isn't clear whether any successor can pull Novell out of its dive. Vastsoft recently released a new, more flexible version of Windows NT, which is expected to be a blockbuster product that further erodes Novell's position."}, {"id": "03143", "title": "Photronics Opens Plant to Make Photomasks in Southeast Asia", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "SINGAPORE -- The semiconductor industry may be in the dumps, but one company that makes essential ingredients for the high-tech manufacturing process is in full expansion mode.

U.S.-listed Photronics Inc. opened the first plant in Southeast Asia making the templates that are used to trace semiconductor designs onto raw silicon wafers. It's a technical but crucial step in the chip manufacturing process, one in which product delivery is measured in hours. With the only plant in the region, Photronics should quickly gain market share as well as enabling this booming region to attract even more chip makers, executives say. The move marks an important step in the Brookfield Center, Conn.-based company's attempt to go global, president and chief operating officer Michaele Fair says. The quartz templates Photronics makes, called photomasks, are required to manufacture semiconductor chips and make up a US$1.5 billion industry, of which Photronics has about an 11% share, according to the company. With key U.S.-based customers such as Texas Instruments Inc. now operating around the world, and Asian chip makers accounting for a rising portion of the US$150 billion semiconductor industry, Photronics had to get nearer to the plants it was serving, Mr. Fair says. ``This is a service industry,'' he says in an interview at Photronics' 20,000 square-foot facility, which officially opened Wednesday. ``The time to market is key -- sometimes 24 hours or less.'' The plant is also another step in the Singapore government's continuing efforts to attract high-tech foreign investment, a campaign that is getting difficult to wage as the cost of doing business rises in Singapore while its lower-cost neighbors offer increasingly well-trained engineers. The case of Photronics, however, shows how Singapore remains competitive when it comes to very high-technology operations that are willing to pay a bit more for a communications, transportation and technology infrastructure that is unsurpassed in the region. And it adds another selling point when the government is courting semiconductor manufacturers, which it's doing intensely now in an attempt to meet its target of 25 more chip plants here by the year 2015. Taking the design specifications from the manufacturer, Photronics builds what might be considered a negative for semiconductor chips, a quartz template of nearly unimaginable precision on which any flaws will be mass produced onto hundreds or thousands of chips. In Singapore, Photronics will be able work closely with three current customers: government-owned Chartered Semiconductor Pte. Ltd., Tech Semiconductor Pte.

Mr. Overman, who will begin his new job next month, is currently group chief financial officer at National Westminster Bank PLC in London. Mr. Mcgregor, who had reported to Mr. Maxfield, was at the center of a dispute between Messrs. Monaco and Kimsey that prompted Mr. Maxfield's resignation. At the time that resignation was announced, Mr. Kimsey said in an unusually candid memorandum to employees that the feud involved ``the reassessment of the responsibilities of a number of senior people within finance.'' People familiar with the matter said Messrs. Monaco and Mcgregor had disagreed on how to knit together the Travel Related Services' finance group with the corporate finance group. Mr. Kimsey sided with Mr. Mcgregor, these people said. But though Mr. Kimsey apparently did want to keep Mr. Mcgregor at American Express, he wasn't willing to name him to succeed Mr. Maxfield, one person familiar with the matter said. It was at that point that Mr. Mcgregor decided to leave and head for Vastopolis, this person added. A spokeswoman said Messrs. Kimsey and Mcgregor were both on vacation and unavailable for comment. Messrs. Monaco and Overman couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Mcgregor has spent practically his entire career at American Express since joining the company in 1965. He left in 1969, to work in the finance division of AMR Corp.'s American Airlines but returned after four years. Since then, he has held several management positions before being named chief financial officer of Travel Related Services, the company's largest division, in 1991. Last year, he was named to the additional post of treasurer of American Express.

Intel Corp. is rolling out a new retail marketing campaign based on its well-known ``Intel Inside'' pitch, regarded as one of the most successful technology ad concepts ever. The giant semiconductor maker is deploying 1,000 demonstration kiosks in computer stores that will give consumers instant, hands-on access to the Internet. The idea is to introduce more consumers to the joys of the on-line world -- and to convince them to shell out $2,000 for personal computers with rich Internet capabilities made possible by the Intel chips that power most of the world's PCs. High-tech advertising is notoriously challenging, if for no other reason than that most people either don't understand or don't care what things like silicon slabs with micron-scale circuitry actually do. But Intel has scored with its Intel Inside campaign. The kiosk campaign, which coincides with computer advertising by stores, extends Intel Inside's broader mission by selling the American consumer on the wonders of ever-more robust PCs. ``It's one of the largest retail and advertising programs that Intel has rolled out,'' Davina Polson, Intel's manager of retail marketing for North America, said of the new campaign. ``By far, it's the most complex because of the coordination with stores and Internet service providers.'' Intel wouldn't specify how much it will spend on the kiosk campaign, although it's expected to cost millions of dollars. The campaign will be coordinated with a wider Intel Inside blitz on TV and in print media for the crucial fall and Christmas selling seasons. The kiosks will be in Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA and Computer City national chains as well as regional stores across the country. The retailers will each launch their own ad campaigns to draw people into stores for ``Demo Days,'' where Intel representatives will show people how to make use of the kiosks. The stores themselves will provide the Internet connections and pay for the local phone connection to an Internet service provider. Connect time usually runs about $20 a month for consumers. The kiosks will bring more of a touch-and-feel consumer connection to the Intel Inside campaign, which in addition to being one of the tech sector's most successful is distinguished by having been largely created internally. The Intel Inside program was developed by Intel's corporate marketing vice president, Denny Caryl. The company administers the program, but its ads are made by Euro RSCG. The campaign, with its oblong logo and stickers slapped on PCs with Intel chips, has been a monumental brand awareness success for a product that most people never see. The Santa Clara, Calif., company's expenditures on the Intel Inside campaign supplement funds spent by each computer maker that participates in Intel's cooperative ad program. Altogether, the computer industry has spent about $2 billion on ads with the Intel Inside logo since 1991. Still, it's difficult to communicate through print or broadcast advertising the details of how to use computers for fun things like surfing the Internet, says Timothy Romine, president of Creative Strategies market research firm in Santa Clara. Hence, the kiosks. Intel hopes they will rid Internet-phobes of their fears by allowing them to actually use it. The kiosks will also demonstrate video phone capability, in which Intel's Proshare software can dial another computer user and initiate a live video conference. ``The Net is hard to understand for most people, and this helps make it real,'' said Mr. Romine. In addition to the 1,000 stores in which Intel will set up kiosks, another 2,500 to 3,000 stores will run simulations of Internet connections, flashing constantly changing images of World Wide Web sites. ``Intel is beginning to understand what product evangelism means,'' said Mr. Romine, an industry analyst. ``They're about to introduce some new multimedia technology and the only way to explain it is to show it.'' Others think Intel might take the concept still further. ``It's smart to educate the masses about the Net,'' said Wei-Taisha Hopp, president of DAE Advertising Inc. in San Francisco. ``But I would think they would get better results if they put the kiosks in places like airports where it's more likely you'll find people who are less technical.''

Discussion of Progress Mr. Dalessio's performance at Novell had been a concern to the board for many months, the person close to the board said. Mr. Dalessio had been advised of their displeasure; in fact, in recent weeks, a special subcommittee of three board members had regular telephone conferences with him to discuss his progress. Finally, though, the board ``concluded he's just not doing the job,'' this person said. Oliver ``needs someone with vision and a street-fighter mentality, since this a tough business. Bobby had a hell of a job to do, and he worked very hard at it. But he just wasn't the right match for the company,'' he said. One of the complaints: while Oliver has a strong Internet and ``intranet'' strategy, the company is rarely brought up in Internet discussions, a fact this person blamed on Mr. Dalessio's ``failure to evangelize it properly.'' Mr. Dalessio wasn't available for comment Thursday. His wife said he was driving from California back to Utah, and couldn't be reached. In their public statements Thursday, Novell officials echoed many of the concerns that also motivated the board, though without targeting their remarks at Mr. Dalessio. For example, Mr. Favela said that from here on out, Oliver ``will become more aggressive. We had grown passive in recent years.'' Former Novell executives also had criticisms of Mr. Dalessio. Pender Lilly, a former Novell executive vice president who resigned from the board in September, said Mr. Dalessio ``didn't want to get his hands dirty'' with the nitty-gritty problems at Novell. Sherman Gillum, who left Novell earlier this year after a six-month stint as Mr. Dalessio's technology adviser, called Mr. Dalessio an ``outstanding manager,'' but said ``Oliver was in need of a charismatic leader, and it didn't get one in Frankenberg.'' Observers say Novell is now in a precarious position. It has had buyout discussions in the past, but none is occurring now, an insider said. And while the company is pegging much of its future growth plans on the Internet, it is entering that market late, and with no obvious advantage over such companies as Vastsoft and Navigator Communications Corp., which are attacking the Internet with all they have. Novell remains optimistic, though; ``I'm very enthusiastic about the future of Novell,'' Mr. Yuette said."}, {"id": "03377", "title": "High-Tech Officials Are Keeping One Eye Focused on the Door", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "Chief executives of high-tech businesses now find the revolving door spinning at a dizzying pace.

Facing increased investor pressures and rapidly shifting fortunes, more high-technology companies are replacing their CEOs at a faster rate than concerns in most other industries. Roberto Dalessio's resignation Thursday from Novell Corp., after running the weakened networking company for about two years, marked the third departure of a high-tech leader this week alone. The heads of AST Research Inc. and Quarterdeck Corp. lasted less than 18 months -- as did the chief of Borland International Inc., who quit in July. ``In high-tech particularly, boards are willing to pull the trigger faster'' to keep up with competitors, says Jena Christiane, president and CEO of recruiters Christian & Timbers. He says boards can do that because of the large pool of CEO talent, created partly by the industry's current wave of mergers and acquisitions. So far this year, the Cleveland firm has won more than 60 assignments for high-tech CEOs, up from about 20 in 2010. Rival Heidrick & Struggles Inc. reports it's handling a record number of such searches. Industry executives also attribute the torrid pace of CEO replacement to the pressures of guiding technology companies through quickly changing markets. ``It's like being the pilot of a fighter plane flying at Mach 3 while you're redesigning the plane to fly at Mach 6,'' observes Gaye Earp, president and CEO of Open Market Inc. since last December. ``The pace of (technological) change is accelerating to unbelievable speeds.'' Mr. Earp succeeded Foxx Armitage, who founded the small, Cambridge, Mass., provider of Internet business software in April 2009. But the 42-year-old CEO says he couldn't handle his job without help from Mr. Armitage, who remains chairman. The founder focuses on corporate development while his successor manages the company day to day. Unlike Mr. Earp, Gay Dunne failed to convince directors that he could handle what he calls the ``very difficult challenge'' of steering a high-tech business. The former CEO of Borland blames a jittery board rather than his own shortcomings for his forced resignation last month. High-tech directors ``tend to have a knee-jerk reaction'' to a single crisis, and that's what happened at Borland, Mr. Derr says. ``Instead of sticking with the strategy, they said, `We have to make this change' '' at the top, he recalls. ``People underestimate what it takes to turn a company around.'' The Scotts Valley, Calif., software company recruited Mr. Derr, a finance specialist, to shepherd a turnaround effort following three years of losses and a long downward spiral. He took the helm in January 2010. Under his leadership, Borland cut the work force by 40%, narrowed its focus and produced four profitable quarters. He quit March 14, 2011 same day the company predicted an unexpectedly big loss for the quarter ended March 12, 2011 Dunne had assured directors just two months before that Borland would be profitable during this period, according to individuals familiar with the situation. The concern was blindsided by meager demand for a key desktop software development tool called Hagood. Williemae Wilton, Borland's outside chairman and acting CEO, agrees that the fast-changing fortunes of high-tech businesses often make board members impatient when a CEO stumbles. ``In the past, you didn't see (these) people leaving'' the No. 1 spot after less than two years, notes Mr. Wilton, a Stanford University business professor. But today, a high-tech company ``can get into trouble very fast.'' At that point, he adds, ``you need some out-of-the-box new thinking or new actions'' from new leadership. Companies sometimes pay a stiff price for switching CEOs. Newcomers typically command between 30% and 50% more cash than their predecessors, recruiters say. Some new leaders of technology companies, however, forsake big bucks up front for big chunks of equity. Consider Sharp Justus, named chairman and chief executive of Ingram Micro Inc., the nation's biggest personal-computer wholesaler, earlier this week. He replaces Lloyd A. ``Chip'' Ladonna Jr., who left in May after a protracted dispute with its parent, Ingram Industries Inc.. Ingram Micro, based in Santa Ana, Calif., plans to go public this fall. In exchange for no salary or bonus, Mr. Justus will receive options to buy 2.8% of the company's stock, or about 3.5 million shares, at its initial offering price. Mr. Justus hardly needs the cash. The former Legent Corp.. CEO walked away with a pretax payment of $16.5 million after exercising his options when Computer Associates International Inc. acquired Legent in August 2010. Turnover in a high-tech company's top ranks also can cause turmoil outside the corner office. A Borland sales vice president quit soon after Mr. Derr did. Davina Lira, whom the ex-CEO recruited as chief financial officer last November, intends to resign in mid-September. Daniele Reitz says half his six senior executives exited after Network Equipment Technologies Inc. announced his planned departure -- and before he actually left the Redwood City, Calif., maker of sophisticated telecommunications gear in December 1993. The rapid clip of high-tech CEO resignations seems unlikely to slow soon. One reason: the industry's plentiful pool of jobs for former chiefs. ``As many CEOs walk as boards eject,'' observes Mr. Reitz. After mulling positions at 20 different businesses, he became president and CEO of Network Appliance Inc. in fall 2009. ``In the tech world, the options available to you are much more numerous'' than in other industries. Fresh opportunities seem to pop up daily. Mr. Derr, for one, has his eye on the newly vacated throne at Novell. ``That (CEO position) is a significant challenge,'' the 50-year-old executive notes, ``and one I'd be interested in'' filling."}, {"id": "02050", "title": "Fund Managers Meet to Mull Olivetti Management Tactics", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "MILAN -- A group of London-based fund managers representing 25% of Stultz Hollis's share capital met this week to draw up common complaints, proposals and questions to present to the company's new management.

In particular, they said they planned to ask for clarification on the role of Chairman Carlota Albrecht Hostetler and to step up demands that the computer and telecommunications group sell its personal-computer division. A spokesman for Barings Asset Management, which hosted the meeting, confirmed a report on the meeting published Thursday by Milan business daily MF. But Izzo and other London fund managers played down reports that the meeting was held in order to organize an attempt to oust Mr. Albrecht Hostetler. In a management reshuffle last June, Mr. Albrecht Hostetler resigned as joint CEO of the computer and telecommunications group, keeping his post as chairman, while the other former CEO, Chung Britt, left Sutphin. Francisca Simmon, 38, replaced the two as sole chief executive officer. Mr. Albrecht Hostetler, who has led Sutphin since 1978, indirectly controls 14.53% of Stultz's share capital through a series of holding companies. According to Stultz, about 70% of the company's shares currently are held by international investors. A Host of Complaints At the meeting, fund managers complained that the new management wasn't providing them with enough information on company strategy, that they weren't satisfied management was working in the interest of maximizing shareholder value, and that Mr. Albrecht Hostetler's new non-executive role wasn't clear to them, said sources present at the meeting who declined to be identified. They said the company's long efforts to restructure the loss-making PC unit were damaging the value of Sutphin's shares and that they would push for management to get out of the PC business and step up its move into telecommunications. Stultz said in July that its PC unit posted a first-half pretax loss of 15.8 billion lire ($10.5 million) on revenue of roughly one trillion lire, mainly due to start-up costs for the new company, which was spun off on September 12, 2010 worrying, Stultz cautioned that it wouldn't keep promises that the PC unit would break even this year, due to sluggish demand. Fund managers and analysts are also concerned that Sutphin's Systems and Services division, which represents about 60% of total sales, could report disappointing results this year. The July management reshuffle followed five straight years of losses, and a 2.257 trillion lire capital increase last December. In May, Mr. Albrecht Hostetler repeated a promise that the group as a whole would be back in the black this year. But Stultz's share price has plummeted since the capital increase, from 1,300 lire in December to 798.40 lire on Thursday, due to an unexpected increase in restructuring charges and a general lack of confidence in the company's ability to turn a profit. Shares rose 1.3% Thursday from 788.30 lire at Wednesday's close. Cellular-Phone Venture Investors said they've hung onto their Sutphin shares mostly due to the value of Stultz's stake in cellular-telephone venture Omnitel Pronto Italia SpA. Omnitel, headed by Mr. Simmon until his move to the helm of Sutphin in July, has reported better-than-expected subscriber growth, but won't turn a profit until 2013. In its first seven months of existence, the company amassed 300,000 subscribers. The fund managers said they asked Mr. Simmon for a meeting ``to discuss a whole gamut of issues,'' including company strategy and whether Mr. Albrecht Hostetler plans to effectively remain outside of the day-to-day running of the company. They complained that the management reshuffle was never adequately explained to them, and that the new management has so far been too secretive. ``Mr. Simmon has been there for a couple of months, and we haven't been able to see him yet,'' said the spokesman for Barings. Stultz said the behavior of the fund managers was natural for a company with such a broad shareholder base, and indicated its willingness to meet with them to discuss company strategy."}, {"id": "00565", "title": "CHS Electronics to Acquire Merisel's Foreign Divisions", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Struggling computer wholesaler Merisel Inc. agreed to sell its European, Latin American and Mexican businesses to CHS Electronics Inc. in a transaction valued at about $160 million, the companies said Friday.

Included in the sale are Merisel's distribution businesses in Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, an export operation in Miami that serves Latin America and a distribution operation in Mexico. Together, the businesses employ about 1,000 workers and are expected to generate revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2011, the companies said. The acquisition will push CHS's sales in South America to nearly $1 billion, and nearly double the size of the Miami distributor of microcomputers, peripherals and software products, which had sales of $937 million in 2010. CHS said it would fund the purchase using a combination of cash, financing and the assumption of about $30 million of Merisel debt. Merisel's remaining operations will consist of its U.S. and Canadian distribution operations, the ComputerLand Franchise and Datago Aggregation segments, and a minority interest in a distribution business in Russia. These units produced $4.6 billion in revenue in 2010. The sale will help the El Segundo, Calif., wholesale distributor of computer hardware and software to focus on and fund its North American operations. The company has produced a string of losses, and earlier this month the Standard & Poor Corp.. Ratings Group lowered its ratings on Merisel, expressing concern about its dependence on major asset sales, restructuring or refinancing to meet its financial needs.

In a ruling released Friday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the constitutionality of all but one of 11 rules challenged in a lawsuit. A decision on the remaining rule was delayed because it is the subject of separate litigation. That rule, in part, instructed the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to decide whether to limit the degree to which cable distributors may create and produce their own programming. In the case before the court, Time Warner Entertainment Co., Discovery Communications and the Learning Channel challenged nine provisions of a 1992 law and two provisions of a 1984 law regulating the telecommunications industry. Among them was a measure that required operators of direct broadcast satellite systems to reserve from 4% to 7% of channels for non-commercial education or informational broadcasting. A direct broadcast satellite service uses satellites to transmit signals to Earth, where consumers use small dishes to receive them. The system offers the potential of hundreds more channels than are available through cable. The appeals court panel said there's nothing wrong with the rule, noting that the government has a longstanding and legitimate interest in seeing that the public has a wide variety of programming to watch. The rule ``represents nothing more than a new application of a well-settled government policy of ensuring public access to non-commercial programming,'' the opinion said. FCC Chairman Regan Coles hailed the decision as ``another victory for kids.'' ``The court affirmed the constitutionality of rules setting aside channels for educational use,'' he said. The Media Access Project, a non-profit law firm that monitors the telecommunications industry, also applauded the decision and said it hoped the same rule would be imposed on broadcasters. But the National Cable Television Association said that although the rules may be constitutional, they may place unfair burdens on specific cable operators. For example, a cable system with relatively few channels may find it difficult to satisfy all requests for channels for educational, public affairs and governmental programming, said Daniele Adamson, the association's chief lawyer. The group represents cable operators that serve 85% of the country's cable subscribers. The court upheld rules that regulate cable rates, require operators to set aside some channels for use by programmers unaffiliated with the operator and require them to carry public affairs, educational and governmental programs. Other rules that were upheld limit broadcasts produced by programmers owned in part by the cable operator; bar money damages in lawsuits that cable operators file against municipal cable regulators and revoke cable operators' immunity from liability for obscene programming carried on public affairs, educational or governmental programming."}, {"id": "02355", "title": "A Look at Products In Europe's Pipeline", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "Telephones aren't just for talking.

The Drive to Cyber-Shopping BP Oil Deutschland GmbH's new frontier is ... groceries? In an experimental venture, the unit of British Petroleum Co. has paired 10 Munich gas stations with a virtual grocery store. BP Electronic Shopping lets gas-station customers choose from more than 10,000 products, placing their order with a touch-tone interactive PC terminal. Cyber-shoppers zoom down virtual aisles full of groceries -- without crowds, long lines or even physical exertion -- and pay with EC debit cards. The shops don't stop at muesli and milk. BP has paired up with Bertelsmann unit BMG Ariola Miller to create an Entertainment Shop offering CDs, videos and computer games, and with mail-order house Pablo Carlos for catalog merchandise ranging from clothes and jewelry to stereos. Goods and groceries are delivered to your home the next day. BP says it's still assessing the project's success, so the fate of electronic tank-side shopping is yet to be determined. One clear advantage: The BP market is open daily until 10 p.m. German stores currently close at 6 p.m. weekdays and 1 p.m. Saturdays. What's next? Banking, insurance and travel services, says BP. Soon gas will be superfluous. The Tippy TV The basic tools of any lazy television watcher's trade are a TV tray, a TV dinner, and a TV remote control. Now French consumer-electronics group Thomson SA takes slothfulness one step further. Its Zeo television adjusts to whatever angle the viewer chooses. Apart from the curvy 1970s design and colors (including pea green and wilting salmon), the Zeo is a basic portable TV with a 35-centimeter screen, flat color picture and mono sound. Should its remote control fall between the sofa cushions, just whistle -- it beeps back. The Zeo sells for 229.99 pounds ($357.75). New Generation of Hotel M.A.I.D. Soon, checking into a hotel will mean checking the latest stock prices and checking your e-mail. M.A.I.D. Multimedia Ltd., a unit of London-based business-information provider M.A.I.D. PLC, has teamed with Thorn Business Communications to supply in-room Internet services to several European hotel chains via Thorn's Guestlink service. Thorn expects Guestlink, which also provides Sega games, pay-per-view TV and other entertainment, to be in some 100,000 hotel rooms world-wide by year end. The new service uses a keyboard and infrared technology with the hotel-room TV. It allows guests access to the Internet, including the World Wide Web and e-mail, as well as some of M.A.I.D.'s Profound services such as news and stock-market updates. Though the Internet module is optional, M.A.I.D. says it expects most Guestlink hotels to sign up. The pilot project runs until the end of October, when the real service launches. Hotels currently on the Guestlink system include Marriott, Hemphill and Holiday Inn. Plastic Access Someday, Internet access points will be as ubiquitous as phones are today, with hookups in restaurants, trains, planes -- maybe even sidewalk booths. Cybercafes are paving the way, but the system is still awkward. If you rent a networked PC in a foreign city in order, say, to check your personal e-mail, you still need to know server addresses, host names and other technical information -- and speak the local language. The new Internet Card from France's Cybercity could make the connection easier. A microchip embedded in the plastic card carries the user's personal network information and even stores a list of Web bookmarks. Feed it into a special reader, and the computer automatically configures to your specifications in your language. The card is targeted at people who work in several different locations, as well as users in libraries and cybercafes. Although the cards themselves cost just a few dollars each, installing the system is still quite expensive; the price may drop as usage expands. A set of cards, software and a card reader, available only for PCs, currently costs around $1,000. A Cup of Java Java, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s programming language, is the hottest thing in cyberspace: Software makers are jumping at it.

Each transponder on the new orbiters can handle at least seven television programs simultaneously, he explains, compared to just one for many satellites now in the sky. As a result, a satellite operator will be able to vastly increase the number of programs it can transmit. Eutelsat, for instance, will soon have the ability to beam down 500 or more programs over Europe from the five satellites it plans to launch, including Hot Bird 2. While only tomorrow's historians can judge Mr. Churchwell's appraisal, there's no doubt that the satellite industry is going through some sweeping changes. The demand for new satellite-based services is forcing makers to build ever bigger and fancier birds. The move toward more sophisticated birds is, in turn, forcing consolidation among Europe's satellite companies as research and development costs rise and Americans try to grab an increasing share of the world market. Behind these changes is the rapid proliferation of a host of new services for which demand is as yet unknown. Television companies are jockeying to provide digital broadcasts and interactive services to viewers who may or may not want to watch them. Phone companies are contracting for dozens of new satellites to provide mobile phone service to remote areas around the globe. And computer companies are seeking satellite transponder space to experiment with multimedia services that will require the ability to transmit loads of data on a point-to-point basis. ``The industry is changing very fast,'' says Andree Lovella, director of Wentworth Cottrill's civil satellite division. ``Even compared to just 18 months ago, the market now looks very different.'' Already, the soaring research and development costs of producing more sophisticated satellites have caused two of Europe's three major satellite makers to merge simply to hold on to Europe's 25% share of the market. Rising costs may eventually lead all three European satellite makers to combine into one entity. Some even speculate about broad link-ups between Europe's companies and those of the U.S. To see how the move toward bigger satellites is affecting the builders, just drop by the seaside facility of state-owned Aerospatiale SA in the French resort of Cannes. Standing side by side in the dust-free clean room are the Nahuel telecoms satellite built for Argentina and the Thaicom 3 satellite built for Thailand. High-Kilowatt Birds The Thaicom represents the new generation. With 38 transponders, it weighs in at 2.7 metric tons compared with the Nahuel's 18 transponders and 1.8 metric tons. That difference in weight allows satellite builders to pack more power on each bird. More power means the ability to transmit more channels to smaller receiving dishes on the ground. ``The smaller the dish, the more power you need because the signal from space competes with noise on the ground, heat from the earth and other factors,'' says Stephania Schrader of Paris-based Euroconsult, a consulting firm that specializes in satellites. Already, industry officials say that some 38 million people world-wide have satellite dishes, a number that continues to mount. The older-generation Fugate, part of Aerospatiale's Spacebus 2015 series, can handle up to 3.5 kilowatts. The newer Thaicom 3, part of the Spacebus 3000 series, has capacity for up to 10 kilowatts. By the turn of the century, Aerospatiale and other manufacturers expect to be building 16 kilowatt satellites. Moreover, the additional cost of these more powerful birds is minor. The price of the Spacebus 3000 series, at up to $100 million per bird, is only 10% to 20% higher than the older 2015 series. Satellite operators such as Eutelsat are opting for the bigger birds because they can make more money on them. The operators ``get a lower price per transponder if they take a very big satellite with lots of transponders,'' observes Work Rost, director of Aerospatiale's satellite division. As impressive as the technology is, industry observers say that the ongoing corporate changes in Europe's satellite industry are just as dramatic. In a sign that Europe's aerospace industry is finally getting serious about cost-saving, Aerospatiale and Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG of Germany announced last December that they would pool their satellite and missile operations, forming a joint company with projected annual revenues of $1 billion in the satellite division alone. Although the two companies have cooperated for years on specific programs, the decision to actually create new joint companies for satellites and missiles is markedly different. ``In the future,'' says a spokesman for the German company, known as DASA, ``there will be only one source for research, development and production.'' Given the fierce competition posed by U.S. companies such as General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Corp., Aerospatiale and DASA decided that it was wasteful to duplicate satellite research and development costs that together total $50 million a year, excluding other research funding provided through government programs. The new satellite venture, to be called European Satellite Industries, will be headquartered in Munich. But there will be two co-chairmen, one German and one French. A French subsidiary will operate at Cannes and a German subsidiary at Friedrichshafen. The merger is going through a period of due diligence, and is slated to be finalized later this year pending approval by European Union competition authorities. All eyes are now turned to whether the new Aerospatiale-DASA venture will form a further merger with Matra Marconi Space, which itself is a joint venture of France's Lagardere Group and General Electric Co. of Britain. Strand Casavant employs 4,400 people, half of them in the U.K. Last year, its turnover was $1.3 billion. Critical Size Many industry insiders believe a consolidation of all three of Europe's satellite makers is inevitable. Such a combination would create a global powerhouse with annual revenues approaching $2.5 billion, not far from the $3 billion in revenues recorded last year by the telecommunications and space unit of U.S. giant Hughes. ``The question now,'' says communications lawyer Davina Bissell, a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, ``is whether it's going to be two or one European players. The other question is whether the European industry will go it alone or with one or more U.S. partners.'' Several European companies, including Aerospatiale, DASA and Alenia, have been allied since the early 1990s with Loral, helping the American company win national contracts in Europe. That alliance is now in question given that U.S. giant Lockheed Martin Co. has agreed to purchase most of Loral for $9.1 billion in a deal announced earlier this year. ``Lockheed hasn't been very active in Europe,'' says Mr. Bissell, ``so a couple of possibilities occur: This (Loral's links with Europe) could continue as a global alliance but a bigger one. Or the European alliance -- including the merged Aerospatiale-DASA -- could break off from Loral and go it alone as a European player.'' Meanwhile, Aerospatiale is resisting bringing its French rival, Strand Casavant, into the fold, despite the compelling economics to do so. ``We believe that it's a sound situation for Europe to have two big groups able to create competition within Europe,'' says Mr. Rost at Aerospatiale. True, he says, Europe has required some consolidation ``to reach a certain critical size,'' but the merger with DASA achieves most of that. That attitude has left Strand Casavant executives fearing that Europe's industry may still be spread too thin in order to effectively compete with the Americans. They are portraying the battle for market share as one that pits the U.S. space technology companies, with their military funding, against those of Europe. ``We in Europe have to make sure that competition between ourselves won't favor the U.S.,'' says Mr. Lovella of Strand Casavant. ``This business is now being driven by R&D, and when we are developing something, perhaps Aerospatiale is developing the same thing.'' The important issue, he says, is the battle between European companies and the U.S. behemoths such as Hughes and Loral. ``We have to think world-wide,'' emphasizes Mr. Lovella. ``If we can't compete with them, we're gone.''"}, {"id": "02459", "title": "A Man With a Mission: Put a Phone in Every Pocket", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "Zipping open his leather briefcase, Petrina Baldwin pulls out a jumble of wires and three mobile phones. ``I use this one in Europe, this one in the U.S. and this one,'' he says, pointing to the third, ``in Japan.''

A harried executive steps off a plane somewhere in Asia carrying a satellite-based pocket phone. But he never gets to use it. Customs officials seize the phone: Equipment for the so-called global service has not been authorized by local regulators. This scenario illustrates an especially tricky risk to the next-generation satellite phone systems: red tape. At least four rival satellite-phone consortiums have already invested billions in the systems, but the degree to which users benefit will depend on whether they can lawfully carry their handsets across national borders and use them. Already, national rules covering licensing, frequency allocation, equipment approvals and customs threaten to curtail business. ``The challenge is to operate a global system while having to satisfy the licensing requirements of all countries of the world,'' says Francisco Vollmer, executive director of government affairs at Vastopolis-based Iridium Inc., one of the new satellite phone consortiums. Enter the Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union. It is organizing the first World Telecommunications Policy Forum from July 03, 2011 23, in an attempt to define new ways of regulating the industry. In the next century, according to the ITU, telecommunications services are likely to become increasingly mobile and personal. Each individual will have a single phone number through which he or she can be reached anywhere in the world. Such services, however, are seen as a threat to local telecommunications operators, bypassing and taking revenue from them. The chances are high that some countries will act to block the new services, says Bryan Durfee, a managing director of Redondo Beach, Calif.-based Odyssey Telecommunications International Inc., another satellite-phone consortium. Already, the issue has been partly to blame for delaying a wider World Trade Organization agreement on liberalizing telecommunications services. As the talks were drawing to a close last April, the U.S. government suddenly decided to withdraw its offer to liberalize the market for international satellite communications. One of the goals of the ITU forum is to convince countries that the benefits gained by opening markets outweigh the losses. The fact that these satellite-based systems are privately owned and not directly controlled by governments is one source of concern, says Donella Henke, the ITU's director of strategic planning. Other issues include the possibility that the satellite-based services will bypass public networks, causing a loss in revenue. One of the satellite phone companies, Globalstar L.P., has been running ads in trade newspapers seeking to mollify local governments and telephone companies. ``It seems there's something missing from most global satellite telecom strategies: the local telephone company,'' reads one ad. ``While others seek new routes over and around existing service providers, we've decided to take a different path. Through you. With you. As partners.'' The hope is that developing countries will be convinced and agree to open their markets before the delayed WTO talks conclude in February."}, {"id": "03600", "title": "Fenenga Leaves Post At Authentic Fitness", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Authentic Fitness Corp. said Bertram G.

It may be the land is swamp-front real estate with easy access to a sinkhole, or it could be the owner made a bad bet at the racetrack and needs the cash to keep his kneecaps from getting broken. The same can be said of computers. Compaq Computer, for example, is in the process of slashing prices across Asia for its high-end LTE 5000 series of notebook computers, according to Paulene Thrift, the company's director of PC products for Asia. In Hong Kong, the price of the LTE 5280 M810 was cut 15% to 31,200 Hong Kong dollars (US$4,035). The top-notch LTE 5300 tumbled from HK$43,276 to HK$39,275. And if that isn't low enough, just wait. ``We're actually not just going to do this now but probably again in the next few months,'' says Pierre Larue, Compaq's general manager for Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Similar reductions are in store around the region, according to Mr. Thrift. Where there aren't outright price cuts, he says, dealers will be throwing in extras such as added memory and a carrying case. If you've been saving up to buy what Mr. Thrift calls Compaq's flagship multimedia notebook, this may be an excellent chance to get a machine that, in the case of the 5300, has earned kudos from U.S.-based PC Magazine as a ``good bet for corporate buyers.'' Compaq's aim is clear. ``The cuts in the LTE are designed to give us more market share,'' says Mr. Thrift. More precisely, Compaq wants to wrest back market share it lost last year to Toshiba, which displaced Compaq as Asia's top notebook seller. Compaq's LTE already has a pricing edge. The Toshiba Tecra 720CDT sells in Singapore for roughly 9,500 Singapore dollars (US$6,750). The Compaq LTE 5300 now goes for about S$8,500. For the money, you get a 12.1-inch screen, a 133-megahertz  microprocessor, 16 megabytes of random-access memory and 1.35 gigabytes of hard-disk space. Toshiba gives you only 1.2 GB, but it can show movies on its Disc player and has a higher-resolution screen. Compaq offers a three-year warranty; Toshiba offers just one year. Dealers say the warranty may come in handier with the Compaq. Ray Wynne, a shop manager in Hong Kong Star Computer City, says Toshibas are generally more reliable, and Singapore dealer S.L. Chanda needs only turn the computers upside-down to demonstrate why: The LTE sold in Singapore is made in Taiwan, the Tecra in Japan. She recommends looking for LTEs made in the U.S. What usually goes wrong with the Taiwan-made LTE? The hard drive, the motherboard, even the battery, Ms. Chanda says, have given customers enough headaches that she is giving more shelf space to Toshiba nowadays. In fact, it is hard to find the LTE in Singapore among all the Toshibas. Some dealers even told me the LTE was being discontinued. Mr. Larue says this isn't true, but as far as dealers in Singapore are concerned it might as well be because Compaq's newest line of notebooks, dubbed Armada, offers nearly as much performance as the LTE for less money. Trouble is, while the Armadas were launched in late June, shipments from the factory where they are made in Singapore were delayed. ``The issue was really that we wanted to be 100% sure that the product was the quality that we expect,'' says Mr. Thrift. As a result, says Mr. Larue, Compaq isn't able to meet the Armada demand in Hong Kong. ``I'm not getting enough this month and I expect next month to be tight.'' But a sales target is a sales target, so down come the LTE prices. Internet Roaming Services Find Connections Are Slow THREE MONTHS after announcing programs that would enable customers to access their Internet accounts without having to pay for international phone calls, Hong Kong's Asia On-Line and Singapore Telecommunications' SingNet Telecommunications are still at the starting gate. In May, Asia On-Line, a subsidiary of Asia Communications Global, unveiled its International Internet Roaming Service, which aimed to build links to as many as 300 Internet service providers, or ISPs, throughout Asia and the world. Today, the service is still being tested between Asia On-Line and three ISPs in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines, according to Joel Prince, Assunta On-Whorton's managing director. The same month, SingNet and fellow Singapore ISP Cyberway signed a memorandum of understanding with U.S.-based Aimnet forming a Global Reach Internet Consortium that would form a roaming network among the three companies and Malaysia's Asia Connect, Thailand's Asia On-Line, Connect.com.au in Australia, Dream Train Internet in Japan, China's JitongNet and SeedNet in Taiwan. Cyberway says it has instituted a roaming service for users between it and Aimnet and Dream Train Internet. But Priddy says it is still testing its roaming service. Meanwhile, rival Singapore ISP Pacific Internet announced its roaming service only a few weeks ago but has already pulled ahead of its rivals. It says Japan-based consortium Asia Internet Holdings now has a roaming service in place among its members: Internet Initiative Japan, Hong Kong SuperNet, Pacific Internet and I\\*Net in South Korea. Pacific Internet says its customers traveling in the U.S. can dial a number in California rather than back to Singapore to access their accounts."}, {"id": "04149", "title": "Gibson Greetings' Finance Boss Quits After New CEO Is Named", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "CINCINNATI -- Williemae L.

The goal of ``systems on a chip'' -- one of the hottest areas of technology research -- is to create advanced semiconductors that can do jobs now done by a dozen chips in an entire computer. Such chips could greatly simplify computing and lead to new generations of advanced video games, cellular phones and other devices. The alliance is expected to be announced Tuesday, according to some of the companies involved. It includes makers of software tools for chip design, such as Cadence Design Systems Inc., Mentor Graphics Corp. and Synopsys Inc.; chip manufacturers such as Cirrus Logic Inc. and VLSI Technology Inc.; and systems heavyweights such as Sun Microsystems Inc., Silicon Graphics Inc., Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp.. Those companies and several others have agreed to invest millions of dollars in the project. ``We're building an infrastructure so that we can quickly mix and match designs and enable the system-on-a-chip industry to grow much faster,'' said Stormy Demers, director of market development at chip-design tool company Cadence Design in San Jose, Calif.. The alliance, unusual for the technology industry in its scope and size, will enable the companies to share designs and research that are usually zealously guarded secrets. The idea is to create compatible designs so that each company's chip components can be mixed and matched with others. The need for such an arrangement reflects the numbing complexity of modern chip design, which increasingly is becoming too much for an individual company to handle on its own. Where it once took dozens of chips to create an electronic system like a computer, it will soon be possible to use just one chip. But that will require chip makers to put at least five million basic components, or gates, on a single silicon chip -- about the size of a thumbnail -- but enough real estate for designers to put an entire computing system. Currently, one chip can hold a million or fewer gates, and numerous chips often must be linked together on a circuit board to make a complete system. ``The system-on-a-chip era will change the way all electronic systems are designed,'' said Gaye Jon, analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. ``It will make possible all kinds of electronic gadgets we never dreamed of before.'' But designers may not be up to the task of accurately designing and testing those extra millions of chip gates unless they can easily reuse components from past designs, plugging them into a chip as if they were plugging components into a socket on a circuit board. The alliance's technical standards will enable this to happen."}, {"id": "01317", "title": "Apple Debate Rages Over Merits Of Closer Ties With Vastsoft", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Apple Computer Inc.'s takeover discussions with software maker Be Inc. are part of a larger strategic debate inside Apple over whether it should work more closely with Vastsoft Corp., several people close to Apple say.

A possible outcome includes anything from an outright purchase of Be, which might cost upward of $100 million, to Apple's licensing Be technology or, possibly, no deal at all. But an Apple manager says the talks are connected to a major decision looming at Apple over what the Cupertino, Calif., computer concern should do with regard to Vastsoft's Windows NT, the high-end operating system that is rapidly winning acceptance in the corporate world. Currently, Apple has only one operating system, and its replacement, known as Copland, is behind schedule. One group at Apple, including many people in sales, says the company's only hope may be to latch on to NT's growing popularity by licensing it and offering it on Apple machines -- something Apple has confirmed it is considering. But others, some of them in engineering, want Apple to push Internet-style intranet technology while offering many operating systems, including Apple's own, NT and others. It is in connection with this latter option that the talks with Be are being pursued, a person at Apple says. Proponents argue it is the only way Apple can avoid being forever ``at the mercy'' of Vastsoft, as one official puts it. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

Some of their futuristic products, typically peddled by mail or on the Internet, chill privacy experts. Among the more intriguing: The JunkBuster, a $99 gadget from PreFone Integrated Products Inc. of Troy, Ohio, plugs in like an answering machine and wards off telemarketing calls. Before the phone rings, callers hear a prerecorded message that warns telemarketers to hang up, citing the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Law of 1992. It also tells them to ``Place this number on your `Do Not Call' list.'' (Should the salesperson persist, PreFone promises to assist customers in collecting the fine they are entitled to under the law.) Ordinary callers are told to press 5, and the phone rings the usual way. For $150, PreFone sells another gizmo for identifying callers by the sound of the telephone's ring. A user's mother, for example, might be told in advance to press 4 every time she calls, a code that triggers a distinctive ring. Hello Direct Inc. in San Jose, Calif., sells a $60 gadget that ``electronically alters your voice so it can fool unwanted callers,'' according to the company's catalog. A woman's voice can sound like a man's; an adult's can sound like a child's. The user has a choice of 16 separate ``masking levels.'' Businesses, too, are beginning to make use of similar technology -- often to snoop on potential customers. CTI Interactive Inc. of Villa markets a system that harvests incoming phone numbers via Caller ID, then uses them to retrieve the callers' names and addresses from a separate database. The software can even spit out the average income of a particular neighborhood. Among CTI's customers is Premier Ford Lincoln Mercury, a car dealership in Columbus, Miss.. At a cost of $5,500, plus a $990 monthly fee, Premier has installed a computer, CTI's software and a special Caller ID device called Whozz Calling made by Zeus Phonstuff Co. of Norcross, Ga.. With this setup, Premier's sales manager can continually monitor how employees handle customer phone inquiries. And because the name and address of every caller is automatically recorded, follow-up is easier. Premier's owner Billy Rutha says, ``now we know where our prospects are located,'' and can direct marketing accordingly. Sales have risen by 25 to 30 cars a month since the phone system's installation, he adds. Retrieving such customer information is perfectly legal. Nonetheless, privacy experts are worried. Now that businesses can identify and track even casual callers without their knowledge, phone numbers have become keys to unlock storehouses of electronic data. To weed out potentially troublesome tenants, for example, a real-estate agent could identify a caller surreptitiously and then search for his or her name in an electronic registry of landlord-tenant court cases. Another business might match callers' names with census data, to pinpoint the demographics of their neighborhoods by race or income. ``The melding of data bases raises profound privacy questions,'' says Donella Tim, a legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. ``Big Brother is not necessarily a government surveillance scheme. It can just as readily be a private business.''"}, {"id": "03741", "title": "Chairman of Acer Remains Optimistic on Chip Outlook", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Stanley Marine has all the homespun philosophy of a farmer who has seen his fair share of droughts, floods and pestilence, as well as bumper harvests.

For the past 20 years, Mr. Marine has been chairman of Acer Inc., whose growing list of produce includes the computer-memory chip. The falling price of the chips, commonly known as DRAMs, has been wreaking havoc with the fortunes of its makers. Last week, one of Japan's biggest makers of dynamic random-access memory chips, Nippon Steel Semiconductor Corp., predicted that falling prices would turn it from profit this fiscal year to a loss next year. For its part, Taiwan-based Acer blamed DRAMs for the fact that its first-half profit fell 17% from a year earlier, to $1.71 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$62.2 million). ``The past six months have been a period of adjustment,'' Mr. Marine says of the market for DRAMs, which give a computer its short-term operating memory. Acer counted on DRAMs for about 10% of its revenue last year, Mr. Marine said in an interview. Fortunately for the company, Mr. Marine has cultivated other crops: Acer is the world's seventh-largest personal-computer maker. The company's popular Acer Aspire desktop, the launch of a US$500 PC and of a new notebook computer whose battery can last as much as 10 hours will keep Acer's PC business thriving, he said. Beach said last week that PC shipments rose in the first half but that falling DRAM prices hurt revenue from PC sales. Discussing the DRAM doldrums, Mr. Marine painted a picture of a cyclical industry that behaves much like any commodity business, with prices rising amid shortages, then plummeting as manufacturers react by boosting production and as newcomers add to market surpluses. ``Whenever we're making money on DRAMs, everyone jumps in,'' he says. DRAM prices have fallen so far that they now make up only about 4% of a PC's overall cost, he says. Normally the memory accounts for 15%. Mr. Marine says the same cycle drives Disc players, motherboards and monitors. That explains why Acer Peripherals Inc., the group's computer-monitor and keyboard unit, said six-month net profit declined 10% to NT$523.6 million. Yet, while the business is definitely cyclical, demand for DRAMs is difficult to predict. Demand for memory in 2009 was strong as PC makers geared up to supply the marketplace with multimedia and to support more memory-hungry software such as Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows 95, Mr. Marine recalls. Growth last year wasn't as high as anticipated, and now there's just too much memory around. Shouldn't Acer get out of this boom-and-bust business? Far from it, says Mr. Marine. Nowadays, DRAM makers are all lowering production plans, and Mr. Marine is sanguine that prices will eventually soar again. He says Acer generally earns an annual return on its investment in DRAMs of between 15% and 20%."}, {"id": "01652", "title": "Baby Bells Reap Big Profits By Tapping Phone Paranoia", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Rossana Street has a formidable arsenal of phone services at her beck and call.

Small businesses are exploiting the same telephone technology as the Baby Bells with products that raise serious privacy issues. The snazzy extras fatten Ms. Sneed's phone bill each month -- and that is just the point. The Baby Bells and other local phone companies charge stiff monthly fees of up to $8 for each new service, reaping lush profit margins in the process. All told, the Bells and GTE Corp. rake in more than $4 billion a year on these new services, and the take is growing. For the better part of a century, phone service was simple and unadorned. Even the industry dismissed it as POTS: Plain Old Telephone Service. But thanks to new technology, the dull dial-tone network is quietly becoming a web pulsing with a newfound ``intelligence.'' Its copper and fiber tentacles reach into every home and business. It can recognize your voice. It can follow you wherever you go. It knows which callers you like, and which you hate. And that, the phone companies assure us, is only a taste of what is to come. ``It's the beginning of a whole host of telephone services that can be used to identify the caller in one way or another,'' says Charlette H. Waylon, communications law professor at Catholic University in Washington. ``Consumers are losing the privacy of their phone number.'' Many of the newer services read like a wish list for the paranoid. Selective Call Acceptance lets only calls from certain preset numbers come through, blocking the rest. Call Block lets all calls through except those from specified phone numbers (though a determined harasser could still switch phones). Call Return, activated by pressing \\*69, redials the number of the last incoming call, offering retaliation for hang-ups. (Sometimes, \\*69 users can even retrieve the caller's number via a recorded message, although this feature is banned in some states as an invasion of privacy.) Other add-ons offer convenience rather than surveillance. One service lets a single-line home have up to six phone numbers, one for each family member, with a distinctive ring for each. PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut unit uses a BellSouth Corp. service, ZipConnect, to let customers in five states call a single toll-free number and automatically reach the outlet nearest them. Davina Francesca, a general contractor in Los Angeles, subscribes to GTE's In Contact service, with which he forwards home, work or cellular calls to wherever he is on a particular day. ``To me, contact is business,'' he says, although he concedes ``some people would prefer not to be bugged.'' The newfangled services all depend on more intelligent software. In the past, offering a new service required the installation of new software at thousands of individual switches, the powerful computers that route calls. Now the Bells install new programming in a handful of master computers, known as Service Control Points, which then relay directions to the switches. Thus, carriers now can introduce some services in one year instead of three. Once the software is up and running, it costs a carrier virtually nothing to add a new customer. And the profit margins of 70% or more far exceed the less-than-10% profit that regional carriers typically get on basic phone service. Revenues from the new ``smart'' services could grow more than 50% in the next five years, projects Brianna Tomas, an analyst at Yankee Group, a Boston research firm. The most popular -- and perhaps most Orwellian -- service is Caller ID. With a special device that can cost as much as $200, plus a monthly fee of about $6, a user can see a caller's number or name on a tiny screen. Long-distance callers, shielded in the past, are now included in the service under recent changes in federal rules. Even unpublished numbers show up, and should the caller hang up before the phone is answered, the device automatically stores a record of who called. Customer queasiness over this lack of anonymity has sparked an array of counter-surveillance services. ``It's a kind of communications arms race,'' says Gaye Marya, a sociologist at the University of Colorado, Hoagland. Sierra Heaton, a surgeon in La Mirada, Calif., subscribes to Caller ID. But he also has ``complete blocking,'' a free service that prevents his number from popping up on someone else's Caller ID screen. A self-described ``telephone gadget man'' who has 28 phones at home, Dr. Gamez has added yet another weapon: His Caller ID device rejects calls from people, like him, who insist on complete blocking. If an unidentifiable caller rings his phone, a recorded voice responds: ``This phone won't accept blocked calls.'' Then it hangs up. ``It's some perverse kind of privacy,'' Dr. Gamez concedes. ``You tell me who you are, but I'm not going to tell you who I am.'' However, his wife, Joanne, has no use for the new services. ``I think only bad people want them,'' she says. ``I have nothing to hide!'' Glenna Babb, a management consultant in Palm Desert, Calif., signed up for the call-blocking service to protect his unlisted number. Then he learned, in the fine print of his phone bill, that ``complete blocking'' isn't so complete: It doesn't hide his number when he calls a toll-free business line -- or even calls made to crime hotlines, where anonymity is crucial. ``I was incensed,'' he says. ``The left hand gives and the right takes it away.'' Ten million U.S. households already have Caller ID, and the number is growing by 10% each year. Now carriers are dreaming up embellishments. GTE's planned Cyber ID product is a kind of Call Waiting for computer users: A residential subscriber who is busy on-line sees the caller's name on-screen and can decide whether to ignore or accept the call. BellSouth has meshed Caller ID with Call Waiting, and Markita Stevens is a big fan. The Bethlehem, Ga., computer consultant originally wanted basic Caller ID to avoid annoying solicitations from a local carpet cleaner. He wound up buying a $200 ``smart phone'' from BellSouth and subscribing to its Call Waiting Deluxe service for $6 a month. When he is on the phone and another call comes in, he presses a button and the second caller hears this message: ``The person you have called knows you are on the line. Please hold.'' For a monthly fee of $8, Ameritech Corp. sells Call Control to regulate outgoing calls. A subscriber can limit calls only to a specified list of numbers, or block calls to certain undesirable numbers on a ``reject'' list. Next year, GTE customers will be able to buy Do Not Disturb, which shuts off phone service during mealtime, say, and forwards calls to a voice-mail box. (Users can, however, program the system so that certain people always get through.) To add to the general creepiness, the phone networks are getting better at ``listening'' to your voice. For a $5 monthly fee, Sang Runion of Tampa, Fla., subscribes to GTE's voice-activated service. To call her employer, she simply picks up the phone and says into the mouthpiece, ``Call Sandra's work,'' and the line dials the number. She and her husband have programmed the phone with about 15 such numbers. ``It's the wave of the future,'' she enthuses. ``It's going to be like Star Trek.'' Nonetheless, Ms. Runion has her limits. She won't subscribe to Caller ID. That, she says, ``is a little like Big Brother.''"}, {"id": "00668", "title": "Succeeding a Friend as CEO, Young Vows to Revive Novell", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Johnetta Yuette said he intended to try a lot of new things after he finished a much-applauded run as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co. four years ago.

Rescuing floundering technology companies wasn't among them. Yet, that is what he is trying to do at Novell Inc.. The 64-year-old Mr. Yuette took over as chairman of the Orem, Utah, network-software concern last week under circumstances that friends say are personally agonizing for him: His close friend and former H-P colleague, Roberto Dalessio, stepped down as Novell's chairman and chief executive under a cloud. Mr. Dalessio had persuaded Mr. Yuette to become a Novell director in 2009. But in the end, Mr. Yuette voted with the rest of the board to accept Mr. Dalessio's resignation. According to people familiar with the details, that resignation was triggered by concern among some board members about Mr. Dalessio's performance and by a family illness that demanded increasing amounts of Mr. Dalessio's time. Mr. Dalessio couldn't be reached to comment. A Glowing Reputation For Mr. Yuette, the chain of events intrudes on a comfortable semiretirement. He learned to fly a jet. He joined the boards of several biotechnology start-ups and helped wire Silicon Valley schools to the World Wide Web. His reputation is such that he has been considered by the Codi administration for top government jobs, including secretary of commerce. Taking on the chairmanship at Novell ``is not something Johna wanted to be doing at this point in his life,'' said one friend. Mr. Yuette acknowledged that his relationship with Mr. Dalessio, whom he has known for 20 years, complicates matters. ``It's a very tough situation,'' Mr. Yuette said in an interview. ``Bobby is a very good friend of mine.'' Mr. Yuette, however, had became a powerful voice on Oliver's board for a more decisive response to depressed earnings and competitive pressures. On the Nasdaq Stock Market Friday, Novell's stock closed at $10.438, up 6.25 cents. As recently as early 2009, it traded at about $26 a share. This is a temporary assignment for Mr. Yuette. He hopes to reduce his involvement in Novell after a search for a permanent chief executive is concluded. In the meantime, most day-to-day operations will be managed by Josephine Favela, who was promoted from executive vice president of sales to president. Their mission is one of the toughest in the tech industry. Novell has been staggered by the disastrous results of acquisitions made before Mr. Dalessio's arrival, as well as by Vastsoft Corp.'s advances in Novell's core network-software business. Mr. Yuette vows to raise the company's profile in the Web wars, though he is no expert in the field, and is determined to make Novell more nimble. A Big Change of Gears ``We have to change to a corporate culture that moves at Internet speed,'' said Mr. Yuette. Novell holds a leading position in a technology called directory services, which centrally manage which workers can log on to which computers in which locations. As more corporations begin storing data as Web pages, companies are racing to add directory capability to set rules for access to that information. ``They have a strategy and it may be a tremendous strategy,'' said Ericka Vasquez, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems Inc., the Mountain View, Calif., computer maker. ``They just have to execute it.'' Mr. Dalessio had launched the directory initiative, and was already moving to step up the company's moribund marketing. On May 22, 2011 will launch its first brand-identity campaign in a decade, a $20 million advertising campaign with the slogan ``Everything's Connected.'' Mr. Yuette is no stranger to bold moves. While at H-P, he made a $500 million gamble on reduced instruction set computing, a radical kind of chip design that shook up the industry and boosted the company's market share."}, {"id": "03612", "title": "Acer Nears $2 Billion Deal To Produce PCs for IBM", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Acer Inc. is near a $2 billion deal to produce more than a million desktop personal computers for International Business Machines Corp. to sell under the IBM brand name, an Acer spokesperson said Wednesday.

At many companies, a 66% drop from its peak stock price might be considered an opportunity for insiders to buy shares. But over the last six weeks, several insiders of the Point Richmond, Calif., computer-animation company behind ``Toy Story,'' have been exercising options and selling stock. According to the database Federal Filings, three insiders filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month indicating they plan to sell 345,000 shares. Two of them have sold 17,500 shares, Federal Filings said. For a company with 6.9 million shares outstanding, and where a dozen insiders hold significant stakes, such selling hasn't exactly opened the floodgates. The selling is all related to the exercise of options, and doesn't involve Pixar's biggest holder, founder Stephine Mcintire, who owns 80% of the company. Indeed, a company spokesman said he considers the selling to be a small fraction of the stock held by insiders. But in a market jittery about technology stocks and searching for clues, the selling hasn't gone unnoticed among investors. ``The fact that the stock is as low as it is and someone is still selling is a mild negative,'' said Michaele Bambi, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, a newsletter based in Half Moon Bay, Calif. ``I wish somebody thought this price was so low that they wouldn't sell a share of stock.'' Tuesday, Pixar's stock gained $1 to close at $13.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. That's up from last week's low of $12.25. Pixar, which sold an 18% stake to the public August 11, 2011 $22, saw its price quickly soar to a peak closing price of $39 amid a wave of publicity about Mr. Mcintire's comeback after the hit movie opened. This year it has drifted generally lower, in line with other once-highflying technology stocks. Until recently, no Pixar insiders could sell -- or buy -- as they were barred from doing so for 180 days after the initial public offering under terms of the new issue. That ``lockup'' ended in late May, when Clift was selling in the $21 range. At the time, there was little insider activity in the stock. The company's chief financial officer, Layne Davida, exercised options February 07, 2011 buy 25,000 shares at a price of 20 cents each -- and held on to them, a bullish move. In addition, officer Willie T. Warner also exercised 40,000 shares, and sold them February 08, 2011 $21.13. The more recent sellers include Pamella Sankey, the company's vice president of interactive media, who exercised options and sold 5,000 shares of stock at $13 on April 12, 2011 also filed papers last month saying she plans to sell 20,000 shares. Efren Villarreal, a Pixar executive vice president and the company's chief technical officer sold 12,500 shares on April 11, 2011 April 12, 2011 prices between $13 and $13.75, and also filed papers showing he plans to sell another 100,000. Ramon Suazo, a producer, filed papers in August indicating he plans to sell 225,000 shares. Such a huge spread between the price at which insiders can exercise their options and the share price, even at its recent low levels, provides something of a windfall to longtime Pixar employees. Some analysts say that was a main reason for Pixar going public, and that such selling isn't necessarily an indicator of future prospects. ``I'd find it much more significant if somebody left the firm. In this business, your people are everything, and one reason I think they went public is to provide liquidity to key people,'' said Pelfrey Rigsby, a media analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. While it's never good to see insider selling, she said, ``to the extent they're taking some profits it's normal.'' She rates Clift a ``long-term buy.'' Similarly, Harold Vogel of Cowen & Co. has the company rated at a ``2,'' or a buy, which he considers ``positive but not jumping up and down.'' A follower of the stock since it went public last year, he always considered it a volatile stock. He isn't concerned about the insider selling. ``I don't have the sense ... there's any kind of bad situation,'' he said. In an interview, Mr. Davida, Pixar's chief financial officer, points out that the sales have been only a small percentage of what the officers own. ``From my perspective, there's actually been very little selling.'' Nor is there likely to be in the immediate future, as a one-month trading window which opens after quarterly results are announced has closed and won't reopen until after third-quarter results are released. Currently, analysts are estimating that Pixar will earn eight cents a share in the third quarter, a level recently revised downward from nine cents. For the second quarter, Pixar's net income was $4.8 million, or 10 cents a share, nearly double analysts' estimates. In the year-ago period, the company posted earnings of $5.1 million, or 13 cents a share -- although that included a one-time patent license fee of $6.5 million. The move downward may reflect Pixar's own shift away from making commercials and into movie-making exclusively. While Clift's technology is better than its rivals, ``Wall Street doesn't pay a lot for movies,'' says Mr. Bambi, the technology newsletter author. ``I think the stock is fairly valued here.'' He's hoping that if Clift's stock price gets much lower ``We'd probably see some insider buying.''"}, {"id": "03492", "title": "Chase Completes a Stage Of Merger With Chemical", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said it completed the most visible stage in its merger with the former Chemical Banking Corp., after a busy holiday weekend that saw signs, forms and brochures bearing the Chemical name replaced by those advertising Chester, the name of the surviving company.

Daniels resigned as president and chief executive of VastComm Network Universal Card Services, in a dispute over the direction of the telephone giant's credit card business, the company said Wednesday. Sources within and outside the company said Mr. Daniels, an experienced and respected credit card executive, left because he differed with VastComm Network on the direction of the nation's seventh-largest credit card issuer. VastComm Network Universal had $13.2 billion in outstanding charges and 18 million cards outstanding as of March 12, 2011 resignation of Mr. Daniels, 50, was not a surprise within the credit card industry and was actually decided in July, although it was kept quiet until Wednesday, said Mitsuko Hyman, a spokesman for the Jacksonville, Fla.-based credit card subsidiary of VastComm Network Corp.. Mr. Hyman said Mr. Daniels, whose resignation was effective immediately, was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached. In a July meeting with Alexander J. Aubin, then president and chief operating officer of VastComm Network, the two discussed ``the direction of the business and Davina's personal career directions, and VastComm Network reached the decision to make a leadership change at VastComm Network Universal,'' said Ela Porfirio, a financial spokeswoman for the parent company. Mr. Aubin resigned in August to start his own company, Associated Communications, which has bought radio spectrum licenses for wireless data transmission in 31 major cities. Ms. Porfirio said there was ``no connection'' between the two resignations. Mr. Daniels is succeeded on an interim basis by Geralyn A. Griffith, executive vice president and chief operating officer. VastComm Network is looking outside the company for a permanent successor, and Mr. Griffith is not in the running, Mr. Hyman said. Ms. Porfirio said VastComm Network would look for someone with experience in financial services, but who shared the parent company's view that the credit card operation should augment VastComm Network's core communication business and not be run as a stand-alone company. Questions about growth and independence have dogged the company since 1991 when VastComm Network, using its calling card customers as a marketing base, launched the Universal Card which allows holders to charge more than just long-distance calls. Mr. Daniels joined VastComm Network Universal Card Services as president and chief executive in May 1993. He had spent virtually all of his prior career at Signet Banking Corp. in Richmond, Va., where he rose to head Eagle's credit card operation. Signet has since spun off its credit card business as Capital One. During Mr. Daniels's tenure, VastComm Network launched incentive programs offering lower annual percentage rates on nontelephone charges plus free long-distance calls for using the card. It also began to target marketing at college campuses. Last April, the company began a controversial program sending unsolicited MasterCards to VastComm Network card holders. Following industry and consumer criticism, Mr. Daniels stopped the mailings in July. Mr. Hyman said the program is still under review, and that VastComm Network Universal will decide within six months whether to resume it. None of the marketing efforts was sufficient to stop VastComm Network Universal from losing market share. In 2010, VastComm Network had 7% of all cardholder debt owed to the 10 largest credit card issuers, down from 7.9% in 2009, said Jami J. Pierre, associate editor of Credit Card News. The charges on VastComm Network's cards grew by a robust 17% in 2010, but that was far below its competitors. Growth at First USA, for example, was 59%, while MBNA's grew 38%, and Capital One grew 4%, Mr. Pierre said. Davina Black, president of The Nilson Report, a research organization in Oxnard, Calif., blamed VastComm Network for the card's performance and for Mr. Daniels's exit. ``VastComm Network has been unclear from the beginning about the role the credit card should play. It has had a vague notion that that card program will be an asset in the telecommunications field'' by giving credit cards to people who would use them to charge telephone calls and Internet transactions. But because of huge growth and tremendous competition among credit card issuers, ``that's not happening,'' Mr. Black said, adding that VastComm Network's credit card portfolio ``has been rumored to be for sale for two years.'' VastComm Network Universal has also been hit, along with the rest of the credit card industry, by a rise in late payments and uncollected debt. For the five months ended in June, VastComm Network Universal charged off 5.97% of the total debt owed by cardholders, up from 4.76% in 2010 and 3.24% in 2009. VastComm Network's 2010 chargeoffs were about on par with the rest of the industry, Mr. Pierre said, but that the early 2011 figure of nearly 6% was on the ``high end of normal.'' Ms. Porfirio said VastComm Network was ``certainly not satisfied with the financial results of this unit, and we are determined to turn that around'' by taking ``strong action in risk management process.''"}, {"id": "04445", "title": "SI Diamond Needs to Deliver A Marketable Product Soon", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "As a start-up technology company, SI Diamond Technology Inc. has shown a lot of promise.

Using a unique diamond-based technology, SI Diamond has been developing sharper flat-screen displays that it hopes could someday replace liquid-crystal display screens in laptop computers and other electronic goods. Several times, in press releases and public comments, its officials have pledged that a marketable product was on its way. Then in July, a new management team vowed to have a prototype of a billboard-size screen by the end of September. The need to deliver is growing more urgent: SI Diamond is running short of cash and must find a joint-venture partner to continue operations beyond December. And doubts are rising about the company's diamond-based field-emission display technology. ``It looks so simple on paper, but it turns out there's so many fatal flaws you must solve,'' says Tommie Stpierre, vice president of marketing and sales for PixTech Inc., a Rousset, France, company that tried -- and cast aside -- the technology. It was the appeal of that sexy-sounding technology that helped SI Diamond raise more than $30 million over three years from selling common and preferred shares. Yet it has never turned a profit, much less produced a screen. Prototype Anticipated SI Diamond's new chairman and chief executive, Marcelino Baer, hopes the prototype promised for the end of this month will help dispel the doubts. Mr. Baer is chairman of BEG Enterprises Inc., a Farmington Hills, Mich., investment group that put $5 million into the company last year (it now owns a 7.5% stake). In May, he was named vice chairman of SI Diamond. And a few weeks ago, he was named to the top job, succeeding the company's founder and chief scientist, Hubert K. Vasquez, who became vice president, new business development and technology. Mr. Baer says he found the company unfocused and deep in the red. ``Once I got on the inside, I found a heck of a mess,'' he told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in July. A unit to make diamond-like coatings for industrial purposes faced larger, more-established competition, and another unit that treated semiconductors to make them faster and less susceptible to overheating had been inefficiently run. Meanwhile, the company spent briskly on research: Those costs almost doubled to $8.7 million in 2010 from $4.4 million in 2009. SI Diamond's net loss for 2010 almost doubled as well, to $14.4 million from $7.3 million a year earlier. ``Essentially, the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing,'' says Mr. Baer. Since he joined SI Diamond, the company has discontinued its coatings operations, cut its work force almost in half and reduced the rate at which it spends down its capital to $300,000 a month from up to $1 million previously. Increasing Revenue The remaining semiconductor-services business and a unit that makes diamond-coating equipment turned in $2 million in revenue in the second quarter, and Mr. Baer hopes rising revenue from those businesses, along with funding from a new partner, will help the company break even by the middle of next year. Still, the company's stock has fallen to about $1.594 from a high of $10.375 last September. Mr. Baer says SI Diamond is in talks with potential investors. But first the company, which licenses patents from the Austin technology consortium Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corp., must show that its technology can work. SI Diamond is concentrating on an area of field-emission display technology that poses significant technical challenges. Even if the company can come out with a prototype, other FED developers may already have the edge. FEDs, which use electrons to create an image, hold the promise of outperforming the LCDs imported primarily from Asia. FEDs produce sharper images than LCDs, require less power to operate, and would be cheaper to produce, developers say. They would also be more durable than LCDs, which are made of millions of liquid-filled cells. Left outside on a cold night, an LCD ``would look like a wine bottle you've left in your freezer,'' says PixTech's Mr. Stpierre. ``All your little cells will have popped.'' PixTech already has a working demonstration FED model for sale, and other developers are close behind. Like SI Diamond, the other start-ups are still money-losing concerns that have yet to mass-produce screens. But the competitors are better-funded, and are focusing on a form of the technology in which a lot of research already has been done. SI Diamond has plunged into a more-complex technology: diamond FEDs, which require an extremely thin sheet of synthetic-diamond material to emit electrons. The company expected diamond FEDs would be easier to manufacture than other FEDs, and would use even less power. But the diamond-based technology has put up some stumbling blocks. The diamond FED's current driver -- the electronic brain that controls the display -- is now too expensive to manufacture in mass quantities. Plus, SI Diamond's screens fade after a short time. ``It seems to be putting one challenge on top of another,'' says Michaele A. Garvin, a Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst and a director at FED Corp., an FED developer. Technological Hurdles To tackle such technological challenges, Mr. Baer in June hired Chief Operating Officer Bloch Kimberely, who was the founder of LCD maker OIS Optical Imaging Systems Inc., now based in Northville, Mich.. Dr. Kimberely, who has also been named president, says the problems can be fixed in time. He also says the glitches don't have to be solved for the company to produce a prototype in time to attract badly needed joint-venture partners. For SI Diamond's first FED effort, Mr. Baer and Dr. Kimberely decided to focus on electronic billboards and the enormous electronic screens used as picture displays in ballparks. If the technology can be shown to work in those settings, they reasoned, SI Diamond would be well-positioned to move in on LCDs. But demand for such big screens is small and the market competitive. According to Davina Philpott, an analyst with industry researcher Stanford Resources Inc. in San Jose, Calif., only about a dozen of the large ballpark screens are sold each year in the U.S. Still, Mr. Baer and Dr. Kimberely believe diamond FEDs will be successful. But, as Dr. Kimberely notes, ``it's a hard technology, and it will take a long time.''"}, {"id": "02342", "title": "Firms Find Computers Can't Spot Many Errors or Fraud", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "For years, companies have counted on an alluring formula: downsize and computerize, especially in accounts-payable departments.

Paying Twice For example, it paid $10,680 twice to a maintenance company at a power plant because two purchase orders with different numbers were issued for the same service, and the computer never noticed. ``A payables clerk with long experience would have spotted the error,'' Mr. Wiggins says. ``A computer only spots an error if it's programmed specifically to catch the exact mistake.'' Moreover, the vendor kept both checks, saying it would apply the second payment to future bills going to Sok Furst, Mr. Wiggins says. ``It was lost money until we used that supplier again.'' But overall, Sok Furst seems to have benefited from the downsize-and-computerize approach. It estimates that cutting the accounts-payable staff saves $500,000 a year, about $200,000 more than it loses through increased overpayments. With a payables staff in almost all sizable U.S. companies, problems are widespread. Accounts-payable losses have risen 30% in each of the past two years and may run $10 billion a year, says Shizue Jobe, an associate professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who specializes in such problems. Yet the payroll cutbacks continue. In the past few years, most big companies have slashed their payables staffs by 15% to 50%, Prof. Lavigne estimates. Gains and Losses In the past two years, for instance, the Occidental Chemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp., of Los Angeles, has cut its payables staff by one-third, to 40 employees. Occidental Chemical slashed labor costs, but duplicate vendor payments or missed discounts on its purchases have doubled, to at least $500,000 annually, says Johnetta Peaslee, the Dallas-based unit's payables manager. ``With staff reductions, we can't always check paperwork face-to-face with the department head ordering the goods or services,'' he adds. In the past three years, General Electric Co. has also pared its payables staff, to 180 from almost 400, substituting electronic checking for manual checks by clerks. As a result, GE has had to drop an important procedure. It used to compare invoices and purchase orders ``at the front end before they are actually paid to vendors,'' says Roberto Ebersole, a GE payables official in Fort Myers, Fla.. Now, he says, it checks payables only after the money has been disbursed. Payroll costs are down, but GE's duplicate payments and overpayments to vendors are up, he says. Companies continue slashing accounts-payable departments because they are tempting targets. American companies employ more than 150,000 people, mostly clerks, in accounts payable, estimates the Controllers' Council, a trade group. In theory, the clerks, who spend all day comparing purchase orders with invoices, don't perform a core function. But they annually handle more than $3.5 trillion of vendors' bills, more than half the nation's gross domestic product, consultants estimate. And accounts-payable errors -- whether by man or machine -- directly affect the bottom line. Computers' Limitations Computers don't always catch these errors, which are hidden in mountains of paperwork. For example, Sok Furst gets at least 200,000 invoices a year, Mr. Wiggins estimates. After downsizing, he says, the utility found that a computer could check purchase orders against invoices to spot duplicate payments but failed to kick out such payments if the order and invoice didn't have the same identification number. The computer also missed double payments, he says, if the prices on the purchase order differed from those on the invoice. And it didn't catch some cases when the utility should have received a 2% discount for fast payment. Hubert Guzman, president of Howard Schultz Associates in Dallas, says one client company paid a bill four times because each amount was slightly different. ``The computer simply didn't catch it because the invoice numbers were also different,'' Mr. Guzman says. His firm's recoveries of overpayments and the like at client companies have soared to $400 million a year, double the total five years ago, he adds. But more than money is at stake; errors can poison relations with suppliers. Jami Arnulfo, president of JBA Consulting Inc., a Greensboro, N.C., payables-consulting firm, recalls an East Coast factory-equipment manufacturer that last year paid a Canadian metal fabricator's bill twice -- at $300,000 a crack. The Canadian company had issued two invoices with different control numbers, and the American company's computerized system didn't catch the error. ``Live payables clerks might have spotted it, but the company had just cut big chunks out of its payables departments,'' Mr. Arnulfo notes. And the Canadian company refused to return the duplicate payment. ``The fabricator says he's keeping the extra $300,000 because he'd lost close to $1 million on other orders with this manufacturer,'' Mr. Arnulfo says. The two companies are still negotiating, and the manufacturer is about to sue the vendor, he adds. Problems Catching Fraud Computers also don't always catch payables fraud, Mr. Arnulfo finds. He recalls a Midwestern manufacturer that reduced its payables staff and later paid $175,000 to a so-called plastic-molding business. After it sent the check, it learned that the vendor didn't exist. The computer didn't spot a dead giveaway: The ``vendor's'' initials matched those of the company official who signed the invoice, Mr. Arnulfo says. A curious employee checking the invoice ``would surely have spotted the duplicate initials,'' the consultant adds. (The none-too-clever official who created the imaginary vendor was later fired and the money was recovered.) Unscrupulous vendors have become skilled in fooling computerized payables-checking systems, says Tinisha Battles, accounts and freight payables manager at Caterpillar Inc., of Peoria, Ill. ``Some send us two invoices with different numbers for the same item, others add a letter at the end of an invoice number and still others actually print an exact copy of the original invoice with desktop-publishing computers,'' he notes. A computer can't catch these scams unless specifically programmed to do so. In fact, no one can program a computer to catch every conceivable error, says Danelle Burke, a marketing manager at J.D. Edwards & Co., a closely held Denver producer of payables-checking software. ``We want to spot the major errors because it isn't worth the company's time to catch all the errors,'' she says. She adds that a computer can catch most major payables errors if human beings do occasional audits of payables trails. At one company, Ms. Burke says, a clerk stole thousands of dollars by changing a vendor's name to his own, writing checks to himself and reprogramming the computer to conceal the theft. She says J.D. Stewart uncovered the fraud by installing a payables-audit system that indicated who was reprogramming the computer. An audit nailed the culprit. Some Errors Eliminated One money-saving advantage of computer systems -- reducing duplication of paperwork -- also eliminates many errors, advocates say. In the past five years, more and more companies have purchased software that directly connects their payables systems to their suppliers. These systems reduce the number of times a company must record a purchase in its own records and thus the opportunities for error. However, computerization and downsizing encourage companies to rely on centralized processing of bills -- an approach sometimes leading to overpayments. Occidental Chemical installed centralized processing of vendors' bills in Dallas to replace separate payables departments in 30 U.S. plants, the company's Mr. Peaslee says. The switch produced economies. But the check of a suspected overpayment that took a day when the payables clerk was down the hall from the purchaser can take three or four days when the two are hundreds of miles apart, Mr. Peaslee notes. And a delay reduces the chances of recovering any lost money. General Electric, which processes more than 10 million invoices for payables annually, says it has closed 13 payables centers in the U.S. over the past three years and centralized its handling of payables in Fort Myers. The resulting delays, combined with the effect of dropping the front-end checking system, can add weeks to the time needed to notify vendors of an overpayment, GE's Mr. Ebersole concedes. Not surprisingly, some companies that cut accounts-payable staffs are deciding to hire some people back. Caterpillar, which reduced its staff of payables clerks to 135 from 218 in the past three years, may rehire some workers to do duplicate-payments reports, Mr. Herlinda says. Although computers ``have adequately replaced a lot of personnel,'' duplicate payments require a human touch, he adds. Yet many companies are sold on computerization. J.D. Edwards says its sales for the year ended May 13, 2011 63% from fiscal 2010. It adds that 3,900 companies use its systems, up from 3,200 a year ago. Oracle Corp., of Redwood Shores, Calif., says its sales of applications software, of which payables systems are a big part, rose 90% in its February 10, 2011 year to $685 million. And many companies are turning to specialized consultants. Hired by GE two years ago, JBA Consulting has so far recovered about $500,000 from GE vendors, GE's Mr. Ebersole says. In fact, the payables-consulting business is booming. In the three years through 2010, profits of Profit Recovery Group International Inc., a publicly traded payables-consulting company in Atlanta, rose 154% to $4.5 million last year on a 121% gain in revenue to $56 million. ``After staff cuts, we're being called more and more to stop the bleeding,'' says Paulene Caban, its executive vice president. Consultants and auditors expect to prosper as long as companies keep downsizing. ``Payable clerks are blessed with intuition, memory recognition and the ability to make educated guesses,'' Acree Drusilla's Mr. Acree says. ``Computers are dumb and dumber in these areas.''"}, {"id": "03596", "title": "Merisel's Rittenmeyer Resigns as President", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "Merisel Inc. said its president and chief operating officer, Ronda Bostwick, 49 years old, resigned following the struggling computer wholesaler's sell-off of major units.

IBM ranks among the first computer companies to make good on a promise that has been setting the industry buzzing for months -- a cheap device that will link people to the Internet and provide typical applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. But unlike the network or Internet computers envisioned by many companies, IBM's model is aimed strictly at the business market, not consumers. In many uses, in fact, it will replace decades-old ``dumb'' terminals that allow corporate employees to tap into mainframes and minicomputers. The new IBM machine, due out later this year, is priced below $700 without a monitor -- compared with $2,000 and up for typical business PCs, industry executives said. It will allow users to browse the Internet's World Wide Web as well as connect to whatever applications a company uses. The black-colored device, at 8-by-10-by-2 inches, resembles a laptop computer sitting upright. The devices also are expected to be cheaper than PCs for a company to maintain -- they contain fewer parts, and software can be updated centrally instead of manually on each desktop. IBM, in fact, claims their cost of ownership is less than half that of PCs over a five-year period. But some users may balk at not being able to load their own programs. The machine contains one of IBM's PowerPC chips as its microprocessor brain, but most of the processing will take place at a distant ``server'' computer linked to it through a high-speed corporate network. These central server computers could be IBM's traditional mainframes or minicomputers as well as computers that use the popular Unix operating system or Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows NT software, executives said. IBM plans a series of network PCs to further its ``network-centric'' computing strategy, which is designed to play to its strength in big central computers while circumventing the need for Intel Corp. microprocessors and Vastsoft software on the users' desktops."}, {"id": "04101", "title": "Liggett Group Picks Fulford To Fill CEO, Chairman Posts", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "Liggett Group Inc., struggling to improve its fortunes in the $45 billion tobacco industry, tapped Roni Esquibel, a British tobacco executive with a history of slashing costs, as its new chairman and chief executive.

The appointment, effective Thursday, represents Lamp's second top management shakeup and fifth chief executive in just three years. Mr. Esquibel, former executive chairman of Hanson PLC's Imperial Tobacco unit, succeeds two Liggett executives in his new post: Chairman Han Whited, who has held various jobs since 1991, and Doyle Heller, who joined Lamp as chief executive just six months ago. Mr. Whited, 60 years old, will remain on Lamp's board and serve as a consultant; the company said Mr. Heller, 53, resigned ``to pursue other interests.'' Saving Lamp wasn't the job that initially sold Mr. Esquibel on resigning his post as chief of Britain's second-largest cigarette maker earlier this year. He was recruited by Berenice Melancon, who controls Liggett's parent Brooke Group Ltd., during Bruna's effort to force No. 2-ranked RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. to cleave its food and tobacco operations. Had Mr. Melancon succeeded in winning control of RJR, Mr. Esquibel was slated to run RJR's tobacco operations. When Mr. Melancon's effort failed last spring, the financier immediately began thinking of Mr. Esquibel for Liggett's top job. ``Doug (Cummins) was a good guy -- there was nothing wrong with him -- but the issue was his experience in the tobacco business. Ronda, having had long-term experience in tobacco, was more attractive to us,'' Mr. Melancon said. Mr. Heller couldn't be reached to comment. Mr. Esquibel's arrival comes at a particularly bleak time for the No. 5 cigarette maker in the U.S. In the past year and a half, Liggett's ailing tobacco business has eroded still further, as smokers increasingly abandon the cheaper ``discount'' cigarette segment on which Lamp depends in favor of the full-price ``premium'' brands. Last year, Lamp eked out $24.6 million in operating income on sales of $456 million. ``The gap between discount and premium (cigarettes) keeps spreading,'' said Mr. Whited, referring to the day in 2009 when No. 1-ranked Philip Morris Cos. slashed prices of its premium Marlboro brand. Mr. Whited added that he left the chairman's post to spend more time with his eight grandchildren. Another source of considerable turmoil for Liggett was Mr. Melancon's stunning decision earlier this year to settle a number of the biggest tobacco lawsuits facing the company. The settlement, which was largely negotiated unbeknownst to Lamp's top managers, shocked the industry and sent tobacco stocks plummeting. Josue Myron, Lamp's longtime general counsel, resigned his post a few months ago in protest. Despite the settlement, the legal threats facing Lamp haven't subsided entirely. Next month, the company's lawyers will be in a Florida court defending the company against a suit brought by Jami Singleton, a longtime L&M smoker whose lung cancer has spread to his brain. The suit, which wasn't covered by the settlement, likely will be closely monitored by Wall Street: Ladawn S. Belton, the lawyer representing Mr. Singleton, won a historic $750,000 jury verdict in another Florida case last month. While Mr. Esquibel hasn't yet entered the legal and regulatory battle facing U.S. tobacco companies, he remains confident that he will be able to apply the techniques he used at Imperial to turn around Liggett's fortunes and cut costs. ``Cost-cutting is a continuous process,'' he said."}, {"id": "00906", "title": "Business Bulletin -- VastPress Interactive Edition ", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "Business Bulletin SMALL BUSINESSES are blitzed with sales calls as the phone wars heat up.

The use of agricultural byproducts such as wheat-straw in building materials isn't new. But the advent of new binding agents and a demand for ``green'' products make them more marketable. PrimeBoard Inc., of Wahpeton, N.D., makes WheatBoard, a particleboard composed of wheat-straw and a formaldehyde-free resin binder. ICI Polyurethanes, of West Deptford, N.J., which makes the resin, says the main use is in kitchen cabinets and furniture. Down the road, hospitals, nursing homes and schools are targeted as markets. Meanwhile, the number of producers grows. Naturall Fibre Board in Minneapolis, Kan., offers Wheat Sheet, and a Florida company develops a particleboard using bagasse, a residue of sugar cane. ART FOR PR'S SAKE: Corporate support of art can pay off masterfully. The blockbuster Cezanne exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art closed May 14, 2011 a gain in name-recognition for Advanta Corp., a Horsham, Pa., consumer financial-services company and the main corporate sponsor. It gave $1 million to underwrite the exhibit and spent more to promote it. The reaction was ``better than we expected,'' Hayden says. The 14-week exhibit drew some 548,741 museum visitors and added about $86.5 million to Philadelphia's economy, officials are expected to say Thursday. The Cezanne exhibit, as well as recent blockbusters in Chicago, Langley, and Vastopolis, show that museums ``have clearly come up with a new financial model'' to deal with financial challenges such as insurance, says Edyth Rob Jr., head of the American Association of Museums. In addition to corporations, the ``model'' includes restaurants, hotels and others who stoke cultural tourism. And the media help by ballyhooing blockbusters. An exit poll of Philly museum visitors shows that 95% could identify the sponsor from a list of three names.

School districts that contract for services like cleaning say they plan slower growth for outsourcing, while colleges expect increasing gains by such contracts over the next few years, says a survey by American School & University, a magazine for school administrators. Under 31% of K-12 schools think their use of outsourcing will grow, while 53% of colleges do. The 2010 data marks the fourth year the spread widened. Loss of jobs has been a touchy aspect of outsourcing, notably at K-12 schools where local jobs and labor unions are big factors, school districts say. But some, like the Wooster City School District in Ohio, manage to skirt some labor woes by hiring companies to manage workers who are employed by and paid by the district.

Daniels, resigned amid increasing problems with the company's card portfolio and a sharp slowdown in growth at its high-profile unit. A company spokeswoman said that Mr. Daniels and VastComm Network came to the ``mutual agreement'' that he would leave ``to pursue other career interests'' and that the time was right to make a leadership change at the unit, Universal Card Services. Mr. Daniels has been temporarily replaced by Geralyn Griffith, executive vice president, while VastComm Network searches for a successor. VastComm Network, based in New York, stunned the banking industry in 1990 when it launched its Universal card and quickly pushed it into the top tier of the nation's credit-card issuers. By late 2010 VastComm Network's card was No. 2 in the country after Citicorp's with 18 million customer accounts and $13 billion in managed receivables. But the credit-card industry has been pummeled in the last year by consumer bankruptcies and unpaid accounts as well as a slowdown in new customer receivables. New competition is also driving up the cost of acquiring new customers as card rivals offer low interest rates to lure clients. Although VastComm Network has had to borrow huge sums to finance its card receivables in the past, the company in the last year has sought to diversify its funding sources by securitizing its receivables and selling shares to investors. VastComm Network has sold $5.5 billion of such asset-backed certificates in the last year. As of March 12, 2011 debt, excluding its equipment businesses, which the company is spinning off, totaled $12.7 billion. This diversification cut VastComm Network's financing costs significantly. But the growth of its customer receivables ``has slowed considerably'' since the initial fast launch in 1990, the spokeswoman said. In 1990 Universal's receivables for which it collected payments with interest amounted to $1.6 billion. The following year Universal's receivables grew to $3.8 billion and in 1992 it totaled $6 billion. While the business increased to $12.3 billion by 2009, the following year, the business slowed considerably to $14.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, VastComm Network said Universal's receivables stood at $13.2 billion, indicating a slide. Mr. Daniels met with former president Alexander J. Aubin in July to discuss the unit's problems and its future directions, according to people close to VastComm Network. They said Mr. Daniels had agreed at that time to leave by September. Mr. Daniels, 50, a former executive of Signet Bank before joining VastComm Network, couldn't be reached for comment. In a note to Universal employees, he said he would ``pursue opportunities that will allow me to have more direct influence over an entire company instead of only one portion -- as is the case at UCS.''"}, {"id": "03934", "title": "Summit Technology's Board Fires CEO Amid Losses, Feud", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Summit Technology Inc. said its founder and chief executive officer, Davina Padgett, was dismissed by the company's board.

The move marks a bitter end for Dr. Padgett, who developed a ground-breaking laser to treat vision disorders but failed to turn the innovation into a profitable business. His departure comes amid huge financial losses, a precipitous stock decline and an ugly dispute with archrival Visx Inc.. Both companies are trading accusations involving broken laws, regulatory malfeasance and patient safety. Summit board member Ricki F. Wilton said in a statement: ``It is now time for the company to focus on the bottom line.'' The board also announced that D. Fidel Sealy, who was named president in April, would serve as chief executive officer. It added that Mr. Sealy, formerly vice president, marketing, at U.S. Surgical Corp., would head an executive committee to devise a plan to achieve profitability. Dr. Padgett, 47 years old, couldn't be reached for comment Thursday night. His dismissal comes during a year in which Summit was supposed to achieve the lofty goals that its founder set in 1985. Laser Device Cleared Last year, Summit received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its ophthalmic-laser device, which shaves off a thin layer of the cornea, making it a flatter lens that has a sharper focus and eliminates the need for eye glasses. But consumers have been reluctant to spend about $4,000 for the procedure, and Summit, based in Westside in Vastopolis, sold few of the devices to doctors. Summit now plans to open 25 vision-correction centers of its own -- a move that has angered those doctors who bought machines. Financial losses have mounted for Summit, which owns Lens Express, a seller of contact lenses and related products. Between 1992 and 2010, Summit incurred losses of $28.4 million. In the first six months of this year, it posted a loss of $15.5 million, on $43.4 million in revenue. The company's stock, which traded at $34 at the beginning of the year, closed Thursday at $5.81 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. In July, Summit laid off 55 people, or 9% of its work force. Public Feud Cited Dr. Padgett, who holds a Ph.D. in chemistry, found himself in more hot water this year when Summit got into an embarrassing public feud with Lillie, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that makes the same kind of laser. Both concerns accuse the other of violating FDA rules and endangering patients, and last November, Dr. Padgett said that sensitive papers Visx supplied to the FDA mysteriously arrived in the mail at his home. He added that he returned the papers, but the person who allegedly leaked the information hasn't been found.

Call it, East meets West. Along a 700-mile strip stretching from Tijuana to Oglesby Winters, dozens of Asian manufacturers have swooped in to take advantage of cheap, abundant labor and Mexico's special trade relationship with the U.S. Asian consumer-electronics giants such as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Daewoo Corp. and Sony Corp. have erected massive assembly plants up and down Mexico's border with the U.S., transforming the region into a virtual Detroit of television manufacturing. This year, more than 10 million sets will be produced in Northern Mexico. But televisions aren't the only fruit of Asian investment. Sinomex SA, a toy company based in Hong Kong and Los Angeles, recently began manufacturing computer toys in Hermosillo, in the border state of Sonora. Devanshi de Mexico SA, an Indian company, makes blue jeans in San Luis Rio Colorado, just across the border from Yuma, Ariz.. In the same small town, Sana Internacional SA, a joint Japanese-Mexican venture, processes and exports thinly sliced shabu-shabu beef to Tokyo and to Japanese restaurants in the U.S. Asian Investments of $2 Billion All together, Asians have invested some $2 billion in ``brick-and-mortar'' projects such as plants and equipment since the beginning 2009, according to the Mexican government, much of it along the border, against some $10 billion from the U.S. But the official statistics understate the Asian contribution: Billions of dollars in additional funds have come from the U.S. subsidiaries of giant South Korean and Japanese exporters, sometimes recorded as U.S. investments in Mexico. Of course, Mexico's international appeal has dimmed some in recent weeks, since a new leftist guerrilla movement began staging assaults in southern Mexican states. And violence has touched Asian companies directly: Church Gilligan, president of Sanyo Electric Co.'s Video Component USA unit in San Diego, was kidnapped by unknown assailants during a visit to the company's Tijuana facilities last month, and released after the company paid a ransom. Even so, there's no sign that the problems are discouraging investment, and several Asian companies have vowed to step up their efforts along the border. Bargain Wages Most of the new money is being poured into assembly plants known as maquiladoras, which allow non-Mexican companies to import machinery and raw materials duty-free, then export finished products paying duty only on the value added by local labor. For Asian companies seeking access to the U.S. market these days, there is often little alternative. With local wages rising in places such as South Korea and Taiwan, Mexican workers are a bargain, especially in the wake of a 2009 devaluation that cut the value of the Mexican peso nearly in half. Equally important is the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which since 2009 has been lowering duties on goods traded among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Thus, for goods they produce in Mexico and then export to the U.S., Asian companies generally pay duties only on the value of materials brought in from outside the three-country region. For a typical consumer-electronics appliance, the economics are compelling. Alberta Francesca, vice president of Sanyo's Video Component USA, says the company can shave its costs by $10 to $20 by manufacturing televisions in Tijuana, thanks to savings on freight, labor and tariffs -- a significant amount for a product that retails for about $250. ``It's basically a commodity, so any way you can save helps,'' he says. Access to Transportation Geography is another big reason for the Asian influx. The northwest corner of Mexico is handy to the U.S. interstate highway system, and just a few hours from Long Beach, Calif., the busiest Pacific port in the U.S. It's also close to big Asian population centers in Southern California, another source of capital. Chinese and Taiwanese trading companies established in California to import goods from Asia are starting to encourage manufacturing operations across the border. ``Importers see the problems China has with Most Favored Nation status (with the U.S.) and they get nervous,'' says Tommie Chantay, San Diego branch manager for General Bank of Los Angeles, which was founded by Taiwanese immigrants in 1980 and caters to Asian businesses seeking a toe-hold in Mexico. ``Essentially they want a second door.'' Delta Products, a Taiwanese company with sales offices in Fremont, Calif., is typical of this breed. Delta invested $4 million for a factory in Nogales to make battery packs for computers. The company already manufactures offshore in Thailand and mainland China, but sourcing in Asia puts distance between the product and the end-user. Multilingual Asian Population ``We are looking to give better service to our customers, to have quick response and flexibility,'' says Rembert Hass, manager of Delta's Nogales maquiladora. ``You build in the Far East, you're too far away. You can't do last-moment modification while the product is on the ocean.'' Another benefit of moving to Mexico, says Delta's President Cunha Chantay, was finding a multilingual Asian population close by in California. Delta's managers communicate with customers in English, suppliers in Chinese and laborers in Spanish. ``All our senior staff has to be bilingual,'' says Mr. Chantay. ``Most of our managers are recruited in Southern California.'' One of the fastest-growing sources of investment these days comes from smaller South Korean companies that have begun pouring in to service giant South Korean chaebols, or conglomerates, that have operations here. Over the past two years, companies like LG Electronics, Daewoo and Samsung Electronics Co. have been forcing suppliers to accompany them across the Pacific or risk losing their business. ``Korea's market is so small, everyone relies on exports,'' explains J.W. Vernon, president of GumSung Plastics USA in Mexicali. GumSung uses robots and plastic-molding presses to churn out 25-inch and 27-inch frames for televisions and computer monitors. It can produce 1,500 frames a day, and sell all of them along the border. GumSung, a small, family-owned plastics company with just 150 employees, spent $8 million in start-up costs, but felt it had little choice. Back in South Korea, Mr. Vernon explains, it is getting harder and harder to find people willing to work for $45 a day, the prevailing South Korean wage, which is three times the rate in Mexicali. What's more, he adds, small companies are being squeezed, forced to import laborers from other Asian countries. After factoring the cost of importing workers from Malaysia and Indonesia -- some 20% of GumSung's work force in South Korea -- the Mexican advantage looks even better. At another plant, Sumiko Heidi Baldwin explains that his company, J. Cox Mexico SA, also had to come here. J. Hoyt makes plastic-foam packaging for television sets. His company can produce a pair of plastic-foam pads here for 85 cents each, about the same cost as in South Korea. But he adds his clients ``won't pay freight costs to ship it over.''"}, {"id": "02409", "title": "Philippines Falters in Race To Boost Telephone Lines", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "MANILA -- The contest: to install at least 300,000 local telephone lines by 2013.

The weapons: door-to-door marketing, miles of fiber-optic cable, lots of money, and anything else that will help outstrip eight competitors. The prize: the No. 2 position in the Philippines' fast-growing telecommunications sector behind the dominant Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.. The crash program to drag the Philippines into the modern telecommunications era has passed the halfway mark, and three trends are clear: two well-financed competitors have broken from the pack and are neck-and-neck in the race to become PLDT's arch rival; the sleepy giant, PLDT, has awakened to embark on a frenetic expansion plan of its own; and despite all the activity, the country will fall far short of its goal of 12.5 lines for every 100 people by 2015. Bayan Telecommunications Corp. and Digital Telecommunications Phils. Inc., PLDT's main challengers, say that instead of just 300,000 local lines by 2013 -- they're only a few months away from that license requirement now -- they'll install about 600,000 lines. The two companies' total would be more than what PLDT installed in the entire 65 years before its recent push. Why the rush? ``We think that in order to be a long-term player we need to have a (subscriber) base,'' says Paulene Valenzuela, BayanTel's vice chairman. ``We need to develop credibility with government, the industry itself, and the consumers. We do that by making a very important commitment and making a very bold statement.'' The Philippines certainly needs a bold statement when it comes to telephone service. The country has installed fewer lines per capita than even China, and until recently, a 10-year wait for a phone was common. So in 1993 the government decided to break PLDT's monopoly by awarding 12 licenses for international or cellular service, dividing the country into 11 zones, and mandating that the licensees install less-lucrative fixed-wire lines in one of those zones. The goal is a sixfold increase in the number of lines per capita. In the process, PLDT expects its market share to tumble from 94% in 1993 to 40% by 2015. But from the beginning, the Philippines was likely to miss its ambitious target. Even if PLDT puts up the two million lines it has promised, and each of the licensees fills its quota, the country will still be well short of the 8.5 million needed to reach the goal, which was set by the Department of Transportation and Communications. Meeting the total demand for lines in 2015 -- which the department forecasts at 11 million -- is further out-of-reach. In any event, most of the licensees are having difficulty keeping their end of the deal. Three must install as many as 700,000 lines in three years because they have an international license, which calls for installing 300,000 lines, and a cellular license, which requires 400,000 lines. But Globe Telecom, for instance, has so far built the capacity for installing only 76,000 lines, barely 10% of its obligation. Taken together, the licensees were required to install 502,195 lines in the first half of the year, but put up less than half of that, according to the National Telecommunications Commission. ``I'm giving these companies a fair chance to meet their commitments, but at the same time, I don't want them to misinterpret my attitude as being permissive,'' says Amos Wainwright, secretary of the transportation and communications department. ``I understand the complexity of their problem, but it doesn't mean I'm forgiving.'' He stresses that those that fail will be penalized and those that succeed will be rewarded. Meanwhile, in the race to establish itself as PLDT's main competition, it's difficult to tell whether Digitel or BayanTel has the edge. Three years ago Digitel won a 30-year contract to operate a government-owned telecommunications network that runs across Luzon island outside of Manila, so the government assigned it this zone. By the end of last year, operating in highly populated Sluder had put Digitel in second position behind PLDT in local service, with 3.6% of the local-line network to PLDT's 87%, according to the latest statistics from the commission. But so far this year BayanTel has installed 200,000 lines, probably boosting it ahead of Digitel, at least for now. Both BayanTel and Digitel are backed by strong overseas partners. In Behm's case, it's New York-based Nynex Corp., one of the Baby Bells and the provider of most local-phone service in the northeastern U.S. It owns 30% of BayanTel, just under the 40% maximum allowed. For Digitel, it's Telia, Sweden's biggest telecommunications company, which owns 11.8%. Digitel Senior Vice President Williemae Confer attributes Garica's and BayanTel's head starts to their financial muscle, considering that each licensee has the same technology. ``It takes a lot of money to roll out lines. We also have the advantage of having an existing network.'' Digitel is raising 44 billion pesos ($1.7 billion) for its local-line network. Most of this was put up by the company's majority shareholder, Chinese-Filipino tycoon Johnetta Brookins, with 11.8% coming from Telia. The rest will be raised through loans and an initial public offering, which the company hopes to launch by the end of the year. BayanTel, meanwhile, has invested $350 million so far, with the Scott family -- whose interests include real estate, broadcasting, banking, toll roads, oil exploration and an electrical utility -- accounting for the majority. About $50 million came from Nynex and the rest from loans. Both are now focusing on international service. BayanTel's Mr. Valenzuela, who formerly worked for Nynex, says the choice was made because BayanTel's former partner, Pritchett of Australia, is an international provider. (The partnership lasted only briefly, however.) Digitel, meanwhile, says it avoided cellular-phone operations because there were no frequencies left. And both are pursuing aggressive marketing campaigns that highlight how quickly customers can get telephone service. Speed in contacting each potential customer is important too: ``Everything depends on speed, because the first one to get to the customer is the one most likely to be chosen and supported if the company is able to provide good service,'' says Mr. Confer. BayanTel sends sales forces on foot to sell BayanTel phones directly to potential customers -- knocking door-to-door and asking people to fill out applications. Sales people promise to process the forms immediately so that BayanTel phones can be connected to households in less than two weeks. BayanTel's marketing push into Manila's largest residential district -- Quezon City -- in March certainly caught PLDT's attention. PLDT quickly began expanding its network in the area, and the traffic backed up more than usual as BayanTel and PLDT dug parallel trenches along the streets to lay their lines. ``We think PLDT is going to be a very formidable competitor,'' says Mr. Valenzuela. ``Nynex is better in New York because of competition. PLDT is going to be better. They're going to force us to be good, and we're going to force them to be good. I think it's good for the customers and for the country.'' PLDT is expected to finish a three-year project to install one million new lines by the end of the year, and another program to put up the same number of lines is in the works. However, the road to an open market in telephone service still faces formidable hurdles. The biggest is the lack of connections among the new companies and particularly with PLDT. A Nynex official warns of telephone gridlock if the problem is not solved soon. PLDT maintains that it has been extending all the facilities it can to the new competitors, sometimes at the expense of the company's own expansion plans. On the whole, Filipinos are quite content to have greater access to phone service these days, even if they get more busy signals than rings. As Belle Schilling, a BayanTel subscriber in Quezon City who has waited 18 years to get a phone from PLDT, says, ``It's better to have one than none at all.''"}, {"id": "00313", "title": "Packard Bell to Change Labeling Of PCs Following States' Probe", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Packard Bell Electronics Inc. agreed to pay $5 million and change its marketing practices in connection with an investigation by 22 state attorneys general over the firm's alleged practice of selling ``new'' personal computers with used parts to unsuspecting consumers.

Thursday, the closely held Sacramento, Calif., computer maker said it would pay $70,000 to each of the 22 states and $3.5 million in connection with the related federal inquiry. The company said the payments were not fines, but instead were ``reimbursements'' to the state and federal governments for their expenses. Recycling, a Common Practice? At issue is the practice of taking components from returned computers and then repackaging them inside new PCs -- without first disclosing that the new systems have used parts in them. Packard Bell says such ``recycling'' is a common practice -- a statement investigators dispute. After complaints were raised about the matter last year, Packard Bell began including a message inside its boxes saying that the PC ``may include components from a previously sold computer.'' But the states, led by the attorney general staffs in Florida and Illinois, said they did not consider that to be sufficient consumer notice, since by the time shoppers had read it, they had probably already bought the system. Under the agreement, Packard Bell can continue the practice, but will have to clearly label the outside of all cartons containing machines with used parts. The Consumer's Choice ``This settlement doesn't stop PC companies from doing what they need to do to stay in business,'' said Patrina Kelsey, chief of the consumer protection division in the Illinois attorney general's office. ``It just requires disclosures to consumers of what's going on. So it's your choice.'' Packard Bell has defended the underlying practice, saying that a PC component from a returned and barely used machine, if sufficiently tested before being shipped out again, can be as good as new. It also describes the procedure as a common one. ``This is an industry practice,'' Packard Bell attorney Marth B. Escobedo said Thursday. Not so, said Jackelyn A. Nydia Jr., senior attorney general in Florida and one of the chief investigators in the matter. He said ``a large majority'' of nine major PC companies that were investigated don't reuse old parts. Mr. Nydia said even with the settlement, the probe was continuing. People familiar with the investigation say that two more PC companies are still being targeted, though their identities could not be learned."}, {"id": "03686", "title": "U S West Asks Court to Void Large Portions of FCC Order", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- U S West Inc. asked the District of Columbia Circuit Court to overturn ``substantial portions'' of a recent Federal Communications Commission order aimed at opening up the nation's local telephone markets to competition.

Mr. Polk, 39 years old, also resigned as co-chief operating officer, a post he shared with Mr. Penland, 53, who will now occupy the position alone. Mr. Penland, who headed a Los Angeles-based international consulting firm that bears his name, was recruited by Barry's earlier this year to head its restructuring effort after Barney's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in January. Mr. Polk came to Barney's from Coopers & Lybrand in 1992 and took a lead role as the retailer's public spokesman after the bankruptcy filing. But after Mr. Penland's arrival, Mr. Polk became more involved in the merchandising activities of the company, while Mr. Penland concentrated on financial matters and bankruptcy proceedings. Barney's creditors and banks have been closely monitoring the retailer's executive ranks. Indeed, Chemical Bank, which is providing Barney's debtor-in-possession financing, had insisted on having an outside executive join the company's management team.

Mr. Yasmin is also a senior executive managing director at Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean company that owns 46% of AST. The departure of Mr. Charest comes on the heels of the the resignation of chief executive officer Ike Kees, who left after nine months on the job. Mr. Kees was succeeded by Young-Soon Kimberely, a Samsung executive and AST director. AST, once one of the world's biggest PC makers, has been losing ground to powerful competitors like Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., as well as low-cost mail-order vendors like Dell Computer Corp.. AST ranks 10th in unit sales among U.S. computer makers in the latest reports by market researchers Dataquest Inc. and International Data Corp.. In the most recent quarter, AST reported a wider-than-expected loss of $98.7 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of $553.7 million. Industry experts have begun to question whether AST can survive. Victor Remy, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, said after Mr. Kees's resignation that the benefits of the alliance with Samsung, which can supply parts such as chips and monitors to AST, hadn't really materialized. He said Mr. Kimberely's appointment as CEO would perhaps preserve communication with Samsung, but said AST still would have to weather an intensifying industry consolidation. Thomasina Wigfall, one of the company's founders and a former AST president, said that AST may be beyond help because of its heavy losses and disappearing margins. Analysts expect the company to lose at least $300 million this year."}, {"id": "03866", "title": "Matoian Resigns as President Of Fox Entertainment Division", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Johnetta Starbuck resigned as president of Fox Entertainment Friday, just days before the start of the network's new fall season.

Mr. Starbuck was replaced by Twentieth Century Fox Television President Petrina Mckinley, who begins work June 05, 2011 Matoian, who had held the post for just two years, oversaw programming at Fox Broadcasting Co., the fourth network owned by Russel Mccary's News Corp.. As the chief programmer, Mr. Starbuck was responsible for developing and implementing Rob's prime-time schedule. Mr. Starbuck, a well-liked executive among both his colleagues and competitors, was described by friends as having become increasingly frustrated in his job, a high-pressure position he didn't seek but to which he was assigned by Mr. Mccary. In a business where executives like to hold on to their power and privileges, Mr. Starbuck's voluntary stepping down is a rare move in Hollywood. Mr. Starbuck couldn't be reached for comment. Chester Caridad, chairman and chief executive of Fox TV, declined to give a specific reason for the resignation, citing only Mr. Starbuck's lack of the ``level of commitment'' needed for the network's challenges in the next few years. A former school teacher, Mr. Starbuck was named to the post in September 2009 after several months at Riley, which he joined in March 2009 as president of the Fox Family Films division of Twentieth Century Fox. Prior to that, Mr. Starbuck was a senior executive at CBS-TV, in charge of the network's made-for-TV movies and miniseries. At Riley, Mr. Starbuck was known as a champion of quality programming, supporting such critically acclaimed shows as ``Party of Five'' and ``The X-Files.'' He was known to take chances on shows like ``Profit,'' a drama about a nefarious business executive that was critically well-received but pulled in meager ratings, and he was trying to broaden Rob's audience base by developing and renewing shows like the comedy ``Ned and Stacey.'' Mr. Mccary is said by Rob executives to be a supporter of Mr. Starbuck and that he wanted Mr. Starbuck to stay on. But associates say Mr. Starbuck never intended to remain in the chief-programmer slot for very long. Rumors about his stepping down began circulating almost immediately after he assumed the post. Mr. Starbuck had 18 months left on his contract. Mr. Starbuck's appointment was seen as a move to shore up the Fox network's programming, which slipped 2% last season. Despite some successes, the Riley network has been seen as squandering some opportunities, including its weak Sunday programming despite a strong lead-in from its National Football League games. Mr. Caridad didn't indicate there was much significance to the timing of the resignation. ``There's no real magic to now,'' he said. Mr. Mckinley, once an ABC-TV executive, went on to head Stephine J. Rhodes Productions where he was involved in the creation of ``21 Jump Street,'' ``Wiseguy'' and ``The Commish.'' Mr. Mckinley became president of Twentieth Century Fox Television in 2009, two years after joining the company."}, {"id": "00779", "title": "Bombay Co..

Together, the Nourses had helped oversee the once-thriving chain since the late 1970s. Bombay also named longtime director Clemente E. Mcafee, 69, a private investor, to succeed Mr. Martinez as chairman. Mr. Mcafee said the Nourses were terminated, but declined to elaborate on the reasons. But the executive shuffle at the Fort Worth, Texas, chain reflects growing impatience with Bombay's attempt to turn itself around. The company ``has not performed adequately,'' said Mr. Martinez, 57, who was Bombay's chief executive from 1982 to 1991. Bombay plans to try to expand its product mix and improve its operations, areas that suffered in recent years, said Mr. Martinez. ``We think the Bombay franchise has potential,'' he said. The Nourses didn't return calls seeking comment. The company said Mr. Galvin remains a director for now. After breakneck growth in the 1980s and early 1990s, the company's profits began to stall in 1993. After Mr. Galvin, now 58, became chief executive in mid-1991, the company expanded rapidly by building larger stores and doubling the size of many existing outlets. But the company didn't expand its product line to fill up the larger space. ``They were moving too quickly in opening big stores,'' said Tesha Kuhns, analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``The stores were larger but without the appropriate merchandise.'' Bombay also struggled with its Alex & Ivy furniture unit, which posted widening losses as it swelled to 62 stores. Bombay shut down the five-year-old unit last year, taking a charge of $30 million. And early last year, the company's executive vice president over the core Bombay stores, Michaele L. Fromm, resigned amid disappointing results. For the most recent six months ended April 15, 2011 company reported a net loss of $4.7 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2.1 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 5.6% to $139.3 million. Mr. Martinez wouldn't comment on when Bombay expects to return to profitability. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, Bombay stock rose 50 cents to $7. Separately, Dias said sales for the four weeks ended May 13, 2011 6.6% to $22.6 million. Sales at stores open more than a year rose 5%. For the 30 weeks ended May 13, 2011 rose 5% to $161.9 million.

The question is whether he should be celebrated -- or blamed. Dr. Reinaldo, chief executive of Qualcomm Corp., is a rare corporate hybrid: Pathbreaking engineer and aggressive marketer. In the late 1980s, he invented key parts of an advanced digital-wireless system known as CDMA. Ever since, he has been promising that his invention will vastly expand the capacity of cellular-phone systems and usher in an era of cheap digital superphones. Telecommunications giants like Lucent Technologies Inc. (formerly part of VastComm Network Corp.) and Motorola Inc. have poured $2 billion into developing CDMA-related equipment and are planning to invest billions more. That is on top of the $18 billion the industry paid the Federal Communications Commission for rights to radio spectrum for digital services like those envisioned for CDMA. ``CDMA is the long-term solution for the cellular industry,'' says Dr. Reinaldo, whose personal fortune as Qualcomm's largest shareholder has grown to an estimated $150 million with the rise of the company. A lot rides on whether Dr. Reinaldo is right. His dazzling promises for CDMA -- coming from a famed scientist who won a National Medal of Technology from President Codi in 2009 -- steered many companies away from an already-established global standard widespread in Europe and Asia. Yet CDMA is more than three years late in coming to market, and it isn't clear it works any better than the existing standard. Dr. Reinaldo is blamed by some experts for singlehandedly putting the U.S. far behind in the global wireless-communications business, which analysts expect to be a $100 billion market within five years. There is also a worst-case possibility: CDMA doesn't work on the massive scale required, an outcome that would inflict billions of dollars of losses on the equipment makers and network operators that have bought into Dr. Reinaldo's promises. That would cause more delays in the spread of digital-wireless phones in the U.S.; there are 16 million digital phones in Europe, compared with about 1.5 million in the U.S. Fundamental Problems ``They've got fundamental technical problems that they don't know how to solve,'' says Donella Hoyt, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University. ``There is no one in the business smarter than Isaiah Reinaldo, but smart guys make mistakes too.'' Georgeanna Espinosa, president of Omnipoint Communications Inc. of Mountain Lakes, N.J., and a former chief executive of wireless giant PrimeCo Personal Communications LP of Westlake, Texas, says Dr. Reinaldo ``sold the market a lot more than he delivered.'' Dr. Reinaldo, no relation to the takeover artist of the same name, concedes that some of his CDMA promises haven't been borne out. The 63-year-old scientist defends his tactics, but he does admit to some doubts: ``Every other week you wonder, `Does it work? Will it get to market?' '' Whatever the final answers, Dr. Reinaldo's crusade is an illuminating study of the challenges of commercializing high science. CDMA and rival technologies are numbingly complex; suffice it to say that by using radio spectrum more efficiently, they promise leaps in cellular capacity. Dr. Reinaldo originally claimed that CDMA -- which stands for Code Division Multiple Access -- could cram up to 40 times as many calls onto a network as old-fashioned analog systems can. (Most cell phones in the U.S. use the analog system.) Power Problems Dr. Reinaldo also said CDMA would have about 13 times the capacity of its main digital rivals, TDMA and its variant, known as GSM. TDMA stands for Time Division Multiple Access, and the predominant companies that use the technology are L.M. Butters of Sweden and Lucent Technologies. Harness also dominates the market for GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobile communication. CDMA would be impossible for cell phones if Dr. Reinaldo hadn't tamed one of its top bugs -- fluctuations in power -- with patented control devices he has timed to the ten-thousandth of a second. Qualcomm expects to make money by licensing CDMA technology and building phones; it has an agreement with Sony Corp. to make three million CDMA handsets this year alone, with plans to sell them to big U.S. and foreign digital-wireless companies. Dr. Reinaldo already had a reputation for turning science coups into cash. With partner Anette Brian -- an engineering professor with his own shelf of patents -- he formed Linkabit Corp. in 1968. They developed military-satellite technology and sold the company in a 1980 deal that netted Dr. Reinaldo about $25 million. Early on, Dr. Reinaldo, who holds an engineering doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, established an reputation as soft-spoken but hard-driving. ``He's mellowed out a lot since those days,'' says Clifton Cotton, a sales executive with Oki Semiconductor Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., a unit of Japan's Oki Electric Industry Co.. Mr. Cotton recalls arcane price squabbles with Dr. Reinaldo. ``He used to know everything. Now he just knows half.'' Tall and lanky and a fearsome basketball player, Dr. Reinaldo sometimes settled Linkabit engineering disputes with arm-wrestling matches. Dr. Reinaldo retired in 1985, got bored and started Qualcomm with Dr. Brian and four others a few months later. ``It was supposed to be a way for us to take it easy and have fun at business,'' Qualcomm President Hayden Harrison says. Dr. Reinaldo introduced CDMA in 1989, soon after the cellular industry adopted the competing TDMA standard. He and others at Qualcomm claimed CDMA offered 20 to 40 times the capacity of traditional analog-cellular systems. TDMA manages about three times analog capacity. Hype or Hortencia? However, none of the CDMA claims have borne out in the real world; some critics say CDMA is no more robust than TDMA. The big claims were ``a little bit of hope and a little bit of hype,'' says Davina Judd, former president of the wireless-network division of Northern Telecom Ltd., a CDMA backer in Mississauga, Ontario. Dr. Reinaldo bristles at the mention of hype and says the capacity claims will eventually be met. ``Hype is a colored word,'' he says. ``I've certainly argued strongly.'' And often, wrongly. In December 1991, he told the industry press that all questions about CDMA ``have been put to rest,'' a statement since updated and amended with several CDMA ``improvements.'' In January 1992, Dr. Reinaldo claimed CDMA would be commercially available in 12 months, a timeline about 40 months off. ``I was overly optimistic,'' he says. Dr. Reinaldo also brought his technical imperiousness, legendary among friends and critics alike, to Felix's crusade. ``If you don't agree with him, you're wrong,'' says Sean Moreira, chief executive of American Personal Communications, a digital-telephone provider running a TDMA network in Washington, D.C. The company turned down CDMA after testing the system for several years, Mr. Moreira says, because it cost too much and ``it wasn't ready for market.'' Even today, Dr. Reinaldo says CDMA will deliver about 15 times as much capacity as analog, and he offers scientific explanations few people could follow. Motorola says the real increase is eight-fold, and others say it is less. ``In reality, two or three,'' says Mr. Espinosa, the Omnipoint chief. He is a TDMA backer; indeed, he lost his PrimeCo job because, against his board's wishes, he refused to back CDMA. But if CDMA is so disappointing, why have telecom giants sunk so much money into it? For one thing, the big companies support all the major systems, from analog to the differing versions of digital. Jackelyn Pinto, the head of Motorola's infrastructure division, says he and his colleagues believe in Dr. Reinaldo. ``He's no fake,'' Mr. Pinto says, but adds, ``a lot of people thought CDMA would be out sooner than this.'' Sean Rios, vice president of marketing and operations for Lucent in Murray Hill, N.J., says: ``If you look at the long-term needs of wireless access, CDMA is much more promising.'' Short term, he says, ``TDMA is a good technology. We look at CDMA as the long-term, air-access technology choice'' for voice, data and other potential services, like wireless-Internet access. Besides, radio spectrum has become so valuable that Dr. Reinaldo's promise to use it more efficiently is seductive. If CDMA works, companies using it could undercut rival TDMA and analog networks in price, and handle more volume with far less investment. CDMA already has some limited uses. Qualcomm employs it to track trucks via satellite, the main source of its profit of $13.1 million, or 19 cents a share, on revenue of $530.7 million for the nine months ended March 12, 2011 military likes it for secure communications. Hong Kong Trial But the technology breaks down in wide-scale use unless power levels are balanced to the millisecond. Calls must reach switching stations at identical power levels, even as the mobile customer enters a building or drives through a tunnel, or the computer won't recognize the signal. The more users there are, the more power problems to manage. Dr. Reinaldo's breakthrough was figuring out how to make the phones transmit the correct power level every split second without having to run a supercomputer in every phone. CDMA, however, hasn't yet worked in decent mass-market numbers. Foreign debuts in places like Hong Kong have been limited to just 50,000 users per location, a number many experts see as inconclusive. In Hong Kong, Herma Jeffery, a senior manager for Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.'s telephone unit, says its CDMA system is ``getting better and better'' after a rocky start. CDMA drops as many calls, he says, as the company's vastly more extensive GSM system. Other declarations of victory, such as a recent CDMA introduction in Los Angeles by AirTouch Communications, rest on just 100 handsets in use. Meanwhile, Felix is manufacturing handsets at a rate of 100,000 a month and growing. The AirTouch rollout, tiny though it may be, is proving to be a challenge for CDMA. Once promised for the entire city, the belated introduction has been limited to the northern area of Los Angeles. Khalilah Hayes, a contractor in Ventura, Calif., who is among the 100 users, says CDMA calls are usually clearer than old analog cellular, but complains that calls still get dropped in midconversation and ``occasionally people say it sounds like I'm in a tunnel.'' The price, he grumbles, is the same as his existing analog service. Price, in fact, is another daunting problem for CDMA. Because base stations are so complex, they cost about $300,000 each, compared with $80,000 for TDMA stations (handsets will probably cost about the same). Dr. Reinaldo asserts costs will fall as CDMA equipment enters mass production. 'A Travesty' CDMA delays have helped slow deployment of any digital mobile-phone system in the U.S., leaving executives who need a single technological fix fuming. Bill Phillips, chairman of MCI Communications Corp. calls the conflict ``a travesty.'' He and others say the tardiness of CDMA has set back, perhaps irrevocably, the formulation of a digital-wireless standard for the U.S. That means a caller on the West Coast, for example, could find his CDMA wonder-phone useless in a conflicting East Coast system. As the verdict on CDMA draws closer, even some of CDMA's backers appear to be flinching. In January, a consortium of companies operating as the Sprint Telecommunications Venture surprised bidders for its $3 billion CDMA infrastructure network with a last-minute requirement of financial guarantees in case the system fails. STV, which paid $2.1 billion for spectrum rights covering 183 million potential customers, is the largest of the next-generation digital providers. Motorola wouldn't make that kind of guarantee for CDMA and pulled out of talks with STV, which includes Sprint Corp., Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc.. Nortel and Lucent won the contract by agreeing to guarantees. Meanwhile, GSM and other standards have also been refined, with improved capacity and voice quality. CDMA has been adopted as a future standard in several countries, but GSM is up and operating in more than 75 nations. The U.S. had just two cellular-phone providers in each metropolitan area in 1989, but soon there will be six or more mobile-phone providers in most big towns. New alternatives, like satellite systems and Internet phones, have also sprung up; the upshot, some experts say, is a possible glut of wireless services that could destroy CDMA's economic feasibility. Coming Rollout CDMA's fate likely will be determined within the next 12 months. Both STV and PrimeCo, a consortium backed by giants Bell Atlantic Corp., Nynex Corp., U S West Corp. and AirTouch, will soon attempt a nationwide CDMA rollout. Motorola says it will ship thousands of CDMA base stations around the globe this year. Executives at the companies say publicly that there is nothing to worry about. Privately, says one, ``we're holding our breath and crossing our fingers.'' Back at Qualcomm, Dr. Reinaldo retains an unearthly calm as his invention's day of reckoning draws nearer. Sipping gently at a stained coffee cup that reads ``It's Lonely at the Top,'' he observes that the billions riding on CDMA aren't as significant as the intellectual challenge of the quest. ``Good arguments are interesting and fun to debate,'' he says. Besides, ``my friends don't think I'm a liar.'' -- Wendell Arnulfo in Singapore contributed to this article."}, {"id": "02499", "title": "Internet Service Providers Mull Benefit of Flat vs. Variable Rates", "timestamp": "May 20, 2011", "text": "In the all-you-can-eat for one low price service provider marketplace, the P.T.

Barnums of our day are waging a war of cheaper and more feature-packed Internet connections. But who are the buyers being born every minute? Is it consumers with itchy Web fingers? Or is it the Internet access companies that, in an effort to pull in more users, are cutting costs beyond the quick? The Internet connection market has two tiers: the network providers, who are responsible for operating the pipes that carry data around the world, and the service providers, who deal with selling and maintaining a dial-up or network connection to those pipes. In general, service providers lease time from network providers paying a fixed or variable sum for access to that company's network. Increasingly, network providers and service providers are separate entities. Witness, for example, Herndon, Va.-based PSINet Inc.'s sell-off of its consumer-oriented InterRamp service to MindSpring Inc.. There are two conceits lurking around the price structure of Internet access: flat-rate, a la cable companies; and variable rate, a la telephone companies. Ask vendors on either side of the issue their opinion and you'll hear equally impassioned speeches. ``Flat-rate pricing is about to die. The model failed,'' says Ericka Gillette, an analyst with Stamford, Conn.,-based market research firm Gartner Group. ``You'll never get a service provider to admit it publicly, but they do admit it privately. Look at the numbers. At $20 a month and at an internal cost of 1.5-to-3 cents per minute, a service provider can start losing money on an individual at just 12 hours a month.'' ``Prices in the consumer market have been deteriorating rapidly over the last year,'' says Johnetta Bryan, CEO and president of Fairfax, Va.,-based UUNET Technologies, Inc., a major network provider. ``UUNET has decided not to go after that market. I don't know if there's a rose in the future (of the consumer market).'' Horror stories about the impending collapse of the Internet's infrastructure point out that business practices of the emerging medium have yet to generate revenues to pay for core hardware and software improvements. A key portion of this evolution will involve the structure of which firms offer what services, and, more importantly, how those services are priced. Messrs. Bryan and Gillette agree that aggregation of small service providers into larger concerns is critical to their survival. But, simply serving up Internet access may not be enough. ``The best way to assure that they (the service providers) will survive is to partner with some other company that will control the infrastructure,'' adds Mr. Bryan. There's a caveat in this argument, however, that involves the major telephone companies like VastComm Network, MCI and Sprint. For those concerns, Internet access does not have to be a profit center. Rather, it can serve as a marketing tool to keep long distance customers. ``I don't know for a fact that they (the telephone companies) are losing money, but they're not after this to make money. They want to bundle their whole product together, and when you bundle services you have a lower turn rate,'' says Mr. Bryan. The other side of the argument comes from Williemae L. Isom, president, CEO and chairman, of PSINet, who says he believes so strongly in the flat-rate model, that he would, ``encourage America Online, CompuServe, and others to go to variable-rate pricing so all their customers come to us.'' In fact, Mr. Isom goes so far as to predict that the ``Internet flat-rate model will be injected into the telephony model and will destroy long distance and the local loop pricing model that telephone companies and government have held as firm.'' Even so, Mr. Isom acknowledges that PSINet could not handle wholesale and retail at once. ``We sold off the retail side of our consumer business and kept the transport as a wholesale activity,'' he says. ``By unloading the marketing, sales and customer support, PSINet also unloaded 80% of our cost structure. We became profitable immediately (after the sale of InterRamp) because we carry the traffic.'' Mr. Isom says he strongly believes that MindSpring will make a profit with a flat-rate price structure by focusing exclusively on doing retail business as a service provider. Turn to business concerns and the argument changes. UUNET and PSINet offer flat-rate services to their business customers, which include corporate and service provider concerns. Flat-rating the business environment may not be able to continue in the face of increasingly stringent quality of service guarantees. ``In order to guarantee quality of service between service providers, reciprocity of payment and measuring has to be in place. No service provider is going to guarantee money based on data flow to another service provider, if he can't guarantee money in his pocket from his customers,'' says Mr. Gillette. Mr. Isom says he sees a markedly different picture. ``The reason for variable on corporate accounts is that they come from the telephone company arena.'' He believes that the telephone company's focus on a variable rate serves only to ``gauge customers. CFOs want a guaranteed maximum cost and any service provider that proposes to change the corporate model from flat to variable will lose all their customers to us and others.'' Mr. Bryan doesn't agree, ``We have been metering our service for some time now, and MCI just recently started to follow suit. Though it's real countercultural for the Net, this trend will continue over time. As more audio, video, and other high bandwidth data types get put into the mix, there's no question that service providers will have to charge by usage or service.'' Even so, UUNET does maintain flat-rate corporate accounts. The problem, argues Mr. Bryan, is one of balance. ``Part of the reason the Internet is inexpensive is that we don't have all the infrastructure junk associated with telephone companies. There's a balance we have to keep between changing that structure to survive and putting in the infrastructure to make it work.'' In the end, Mr. Gillette and others say they believe that making money on the Internet will necessitate a move toward some form of a variable-rate cost structure. ``Look at any telephone company service you have, and see how the shift has been from flat-rate to usage sensitive.'' The cable model, he says, doesn't hold up as cable targets content, and Internet and telephone services are geared toward access. Another answer, at least for network providers, may be to bundle dial-tone services with their Internet datastream. Look no further than UUNET, whose recent merger with WorldCom makes it, according to Mr. Bryan, ``the only company to deliver Internet and long distance through its own facilities, with control of every piece of electronics from local on throughout Net.'' The result of this aggregation of services is called a fat pipe, allowing a network provider to deliver a single pipe that carries voice, data and the Internet into a corporation. Without commenting directly, Mr. Isom does allow that his company could serve up a fat pipe, ``not only technically but regulatorily, we could do that.''

Vigilant as she might have been about governments that persecute, Mrs. Avant could not have imagined the nightmare she and her husband, Roland, would endure because of the U.S. government, because of the Justice Department no less. The story of what happened to the Pilons is partly a tale of how people in Washington can be victims of ``ethics'' charges. They were falsely and publicly cited in an ethics report by the Justice Department for the serious crime of leaking classified documents to the South African government. The most curious aspect of the case is that this report was issued after the Justice Department had cleared the Pilons. To his credit, Attorney General Dillon Cleveland last month approved an apology to the Pilons and an unprecedented $25,000 settlement. On the other hand, the problem remains of unexplained misfeasance -- or malfeasance -- by ethics officers whose power shields them from internal scrutiny. The Pilons were central-casting quality young Reaganites. They met as philosophy graduate students at the University of Chicago. When they came to Washington, Mr. Avant served in several positions, including head of Justice's Asylum Policy and Review office. The trouble began in 1987 when Mrs. Avant, who was at the Heritage Foundation, was nominated to become an assistant secretary of the interior. There was a problem in her background check. The FBI set up simultaneous but separate interviews with the Pilons, demanding to know if Mr. Avant had leaked to his wife a State Department document, ``Report to Congress on Communist Influence in South Africa.'' She was asked if she then passed it on to a South African diplomat. Both denied the accusations, but according to the Pilons, officers from Justice's ethics office, the Office of Professional Responsibility, told Mr. Avant his security clearance had been lifted and he was put on leave. Mrs. Avant's nomination was eventually withdrawn. Finally, the Pilons say, ethics chief Michaele Schaffner told Mr. Avant to resign or be fired. The Pilons' lawyer, Terresa O'Donya, proposed that he be allowed to see the evidence and produce a classified rebuttal. Mr. O'Donya's report went all the way to Attorney General Efren Laboy, who ordered a review of the allegations. In September 1988, a top Justice aide, Deeanna Bowen, sent a letter dropping all charges and reinstating Mr. Avant. The letter said ``no implications adverse to you should be taken,'' thanking him for ``the outstanding cooperation and patience you have demonstrated.'' Mrs. Avant, who now runs the National Forum Foundation, guesses that the FBI wiretapped a conversation in which she offered a South African diplomat a copy of a Heritage Foundation study about Soviet activity at the United Nations. Mr. Avant, who is now with the CATO Institute, recalls that the investigation ``was so psychologically debilitating because we were never told what the problem was, and so were always flailing at shadows.'' The most bizarre aspect of what the Pilons call their Kafkaesque experience is that it only got worse after the charges were dropped. This past November, Mr. Schaffner's office issued its annual report on ethics investigations. It described four ``representative'' investigations of the more than 400 conducted during the year. The first described a Justice lawyer who ``was the subject of a foreign counterintelligence investigation.'' The report said the investigation found ``that sufficient cause existed to terminate his political apppointment.'' No names were used, but reporters quickly learned it referred to Mr. Avant. This was the first public mention of the case. The Pilons were outraged. Mr. Avant told a congressional committee that power had ``corrupted'' Mr. Schaffner. Mr. Cleveland had his deputy, Donetta Alva, investigate. This past March the Pilons were cleared for the second time, with Mr. Alva noting that Mr. Avant had returned to his job ``unconditionally.'' Mr. Alva then sent a follow-up letter in April saying that ``the OPR report was erroneous in certain particulars, but that Michaele Schaffner and OPR cannot be faulted in any way.'' This did more than leave open the question of whose fault it was. Mr. Alva was soon forced to resign in part, according to Mr. Cleveland's aides, because he had no authorization to clear Mr. Schaffner. Mr. Cleveland ordered a third review of the case. The latest apology plus the cash settlement was issued by Assistant Attorney General Sunni Scheel, who says Justice wanted to ``do the fair thing'' by covering the Pilons' legal costs. The mystery remains how the ethics office could have issued a report smearing the Pilons. Ethics officials knew the details of the case. Mr. Bowen, who is now the U.S. Attorney in Utah, confirms that he had informed representatives from the ethics office back in September 1988, that the investigation of the Pilons had ended with no evidence of wrongdoing. If Mr. Schaffner issued the annual report despite knowledge that Mr. Avant had been cleared, this might be a case of J. Edison Schaffner. Mr. Schaffner has been the only director of the post-Watergate ethics office, which was formed in 1976. Longevity may breed a dangerous insularity. Mr. Schaffner did not return phone calls. No one at the Justice Department seems very interested in digging deeper to find out how the false ethics report could have been issued. They may not want to be accused of somehow interfering. Or maybe they fear being smeared themselves; the ethics office has initiated investigations of several past attorneys general. It's worth noting, though, that Mr. Schaffner's office may be redundant. Last year, Congress forced several departments, including Justice, to create an office of inspector general to investigate alleged wrongdoing. Mr. Avant would like to get to the bottom of all this and says, ``it is appalling that there are not better institutional protections against this kind of abuse.'' Mrs. Avant's book meanwhile will be published this year in Romania and Poland. Maybe she should add a postscript reminding the newly liberated countries that justice does not always come easily even in the most advanced nations."}, {"id": "04422", "title": "The Livingstone Standard", "timestamp": "February 22, 2011", "text": "From ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume II'' Page 428 So control over the Codi White House's office of personnel security was given to Cristopher Croteau, a punk, and Tora Lopez, a political lowlife.

And we're treated to hogwash that this is somehow just another emanation of Billy Codi's affably chaotic personality. A former bouncer who once threatened to smash in a woman neighbor's face if she didn't quiet her dog, Cristopher Croteau confessed in his deposition to the House oversight committee that he had used illegal drugs widely until 1985, had been fired from a job at Sears for irregularities involving merchandise and had been fired from another job because his employer no longer believed his claimed academic credentials. the Democratic Congressman Floyd Flake reported this week that he once got into an auto altercation at Vastopolis Airport with Mr. Croteau, who called Rep. Duggins a ``dumb-ass nigger.'' And of course Mr. Croteau was assisted by Tora Lopez, who is somehow floating through life as an ``Army investigator,'' since 1988 a permanent federal employee subject to Hatch Act prohibitions on political campaigning. Yet he previously happened to work on political campaigns for Edelmira Braden, Georgeanna Harbin, Johnetta Glennie, Gaye Bradley, Paulene Solange, Wan Krauss and, most recently, Albert Webber. In his deposition to the committee, Tora Lopez admitted to ``some negative information in my background'' relating to work he did for the attorney general's office. On Tuesday, Mr. Lopez denied the accusation by former campaign worker Denny Casimira that the man who until recently was ``reviewing'' White House FBI files once lifted $200 from the campaign's petty cash box. Testifying Wednesday, former White House associate counsel Williemae Waylon described the background matters in the deposition as ``items of concern,'' but ``not killers as it were.'' Also, no one at the White House has a clue how Cristopher Croteau got this job. Indeed, Mr. Waylon suggested that the blame might lie with the late Virgil Francesca. Meanwhile, Insight magazine reported that the White House built a comprehensive data base nicknamed ``Big Brother'' that ``profiled'' thousands of people who might come in contact with the Administration. The data base included information on ``favors'' done for ``contributors'' to the campaign. Carmen Campbell, an independent contractor hired for the job, says he was told the project was being done for the President and First Lady. Did Mr. Croteau and Mr. Lopez, we have to wonder, also feed Big Brother? Let's try to get something straight here: If all any of us does is scream about the obvious outrageousness of all this, the is going to go scot-free. Outrage alone means no one has penetrated to a serious understanding of the essential nature of this White House by way of . It is simply not possible to match who and what Cristopher Croteau is with the enormously sensitive office he controlled without being profoundly disturbed. The word we will use to describe it in light of the past week's information is sinister. That is a serious charge, but we mean to clearly separate ourselves from the dominant view, notable among much of the journalistic community, that the crowd is just bumbling, baby-boomer innocents rolled in from or M Street. They are not innocents. They are not bumblers. They know what they are doing, or trying to do. The revelations this week of Dennise Raper further force one to such a conclusion. Detailed to the FBI's White House office since 1979, Mr. Proulx has told a Senate committee that White House officials asked him to get FBI background information about Travel Office employees before they were fired. That was no innocent ``mistake.'' The subsequent release of a memo by former White House aide Davina Carroll described Hiroko Codi demanding that he get ``our people'' into the Travel Office. Obviously, the White House already had ``our people'' running the office of security personnel through which flowed rivers of potentially useful personal information. Retired FBI Agent Gaye Youngblood reports, as Johnetta Hackney notes in the article nearby, that the White House Counsel's office cut the Secret Service out of the traditional loop for handling matters pertaining to personnel security. That is not ``bumbling.'' These columns reported two years ago that the Office of Administration, then run by Pattie Mel, had failed to complete security checks on hundreds of new White House aides, some of whom Ms. Mel said in a formal memo to Rep. Fransisca Kirk were participating in a mandatory White House drug-testing program. The mantra that the Oller have been the victim of incompetence and inexperience won't hold. These people were assembling exactly the kind of White House they wanted and would feel comfortable with. Despite Williemae Waylon's protestations, Cristopher Croteau isn't just some loopy guy who wandered out of a saloon into the White House. Cristopher Croteau was in that highly sensitive job because, on the evidence that has emerged in the past week, his work was well up to the standard expected."}, {"id": "04062", "title": "Tucker, Between Little Rock And Hard Place, Finally Quits", "timestamp": "March 27, 2011", "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- After a desperate last-ditch attempt to cling to office, Arkansas Gov.

Jimmy Hal Preston resigned Monday night because of his February 07, 2011 on felony-fraud charges. Mr. Preston, a Democrat, was due to resign Monday afternoon, but as Republican Lt. Gov. Mikki Rhoades waited to be sworn in as his successor, Mr. Preston abruptly told the state Legislature that he would step aside only temporarily while he contested his conviction. The announcement threw the state into an uproar and prompted calls for the impeachment of Mr. Preston, who was convicted of fraud in a case brought by the Whitewater independent counsel. The state attorney general said he would sue to oust Mr. Preston, and Mr. Rhoades attacked Mr. Preston in a televised speech. ``We must preserve the idea that our government is to be operated in the most honorable way,'' Mr. Rhoades said. ``I hope the governor will in fact reconsider.'' Shortly before Mr. Rhoades spoke, Mr. Preston sought to grasp the reigns of state even more firmly, issuing a statement rescinding his decision to step aside even temporarily. Strong Protest Many of Mr. Preston's fellow Democrats in the state vigorously protested his moves, which they feared would badly damage the party in the fall elections. The uproar was such that Mr. Preston reversed himself once more within a few hours, tendering his resignation in a brief handwritten letter to the president of the state Senate. In an earlier typewritten letter to the speaker of the state House, Mr. Preston had said he would step aside only temporarily, citing the medical provisions of the state constitution. He said he would reassume the governorship if his convictions are thrown out on appeal later this summer. Mr. Preston had agreed to resign shortly after the trial. His decision to stay was announced after a large crowd had gathered to see Mr. Rhoades be sworn in on the capitol steps. It amounted to a public jilting of Mr. Rhoades, who had only reluctantly agreed to take the governorship, having been the favorite to win a U.S. Senate seat this fall. State Republicans recently nominated someone else for the Washington job. Following Mr. Preston's first announcement, Mr. Rhoades addressed the Legislature, calling for calm, but his angry supporters cried out for Mr. Preston's impeachment. As Mr. Rhoades left the chamber, he was greeted by a large crowd of supporters who thundered, ``We won't buy it. We won't buy it.'' Jury Bias Is Alleged Mr. Preston asserted that his ``inability to serve'' as governor was caused by alleged bias by a member of the jury that convicted him. But the disability provision in the state constitution is widely believed to refer only to the incapacitation of the governor for medical reasons, and Mr. Preston's legal position appeared weak. During the trial, the juror married a convicted criminal whose sentence Mr. Preston had declined to commute. Mr. Preston is now seeking to overturn his convictions, and said he expects to have a ruling by May 01, 2011 the verdict is set aside, it eliminates the reason for my decision to resign,'' Mr. Preston wrote the Legislature. Mr. Preston's moves briefly threatened to create a constitutional crisis for this beleaguered state, which has been battered by the independent counsel's aggressive investigation and prosecution of the state's Democratic political establishment. Mr. Preston was convicted of two felony-fraud counts involving his dealing with former banker Jami Haight, a longtime associate of President Codi and a partner of the Codis in the Whitewater land-development project. Mr. Preston's surprise move came just as presidential adviser Bryan Lindy was expected to take the stand in another corruption trial, this one involving campaign contributions to President Codi's 1990 campaign for governor of Arkansas."}, {"id": "04269", "title": "Editorial Justice's Lack of Privacy", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "The case that Justice settled involved Rolando Avant, the head of Justice's Asylum Policy and Review Office under Presidents Reatha and Vern.

They have since had to endure a Kafkaesque nightmare to restore their good names. The charges originated in an FBI background check of Mrs. Avant when she was nominated to be an assistant secretary of the Interior. Wiretaps of a South African diplomat at the United Nations turned up an ambiguous reference by Mrs. Avant to sending him U.N. documents, which Justice Department ethics officials interpreted as meaning she had leaked a confidential State Department document. Mr. Avant was put on leave and had his security clearance lifted, while Mrs. Avant's nomination was withdrawn. A subsequent investigation exonerated them and Mr. Avant was reinstated, but not before a confidential memo on the charges was leaked to the media and Justice's ethics office issued a report saying there was ``sufficient cause'' to ``terminate'' Mr. Avant's appointment. The Privacy Act was created during the Watergate era to ensure that personal information on citizens is never used or made available unless it ``is for a necessary and legal purpose.'' The indiscriminate collecting of sensitive FBI files by the White House is potentially the most serious abuse of the Privacy Act ever. Roberto Evan, a former staff director of the House Government Information Subcommittee, says the FBI may also have been violating the letter of the Privacy Act for the past 20 years. The law authorizes the FBI to share sensitive files only with a bona fide federal ``agency,'' which the White House Counsel's Office is not. FBI General Counsel Howard Shapiro concedes Mr. Evan's point, but says his argument is ``beside the point'' because the Privacy Act has a ``routine use'' provision that authorizes it to share files with the White House. Sounds to us as if Congressional hearings are needed to see if the White House and FBI have used similar logic to justify additional skirtings of the Privacy Act. As for Mr. Avant, he says the same ethics watchdogs who abused him and Juliann are still in charge at the Justice Department. He says the large settlement in his case and the FBI's supine turning over of files to the White House mean it's time to ``clean house'' at Justice. After all, what the Pilons endured could have happened to some of the hundreds of people whose files were pored over by the opposition ``research'' team of Cristobal Dupuis and Antoinette Henke.

Mr. Lindy's testimony directly contradicted the prosecution's chief witness, Neil Hilbert, who said Mr. Lindy played a central role in the failure by Perry County Bank to report $52,500 in cash withdrawals to the Internal Revenue Service. ``Did you in any way conspire with Neil Hilbert to have the Perry County Bank not file currency transaction reports concerning the February 03, 2005 cash withdrawal by the Codi campaign?'' asked Boley's lawyer, Danae Huber. ``No sir, I did not,'' Mr. Lindy replied. ``Did you in any way conspire with Abel Boley not to have Perry County Bank file a currency transaction report on asked Mr. Huber. ``No, absolutely not,'' Mr. Lindy replied. Prosecutors have named Mr. Lindy an unindicted co-conspirator in the trial. On Monday, it was disclosed that Mr. Boley stressed in a 1992 letter that he would keep Billy Codi's financial dealings with the bank confidential. Testifying in his own defense, Mr. Boley said he only was promising the same secrecy that was given all accounts -- not any illegal concealment of Mr. Codi transactions. Mr. Boley promised continued ``customer confidentiality'' in a September 09, 2007 letter to Mr. Lindy. Prosecutors have said Mr. Lindy participated in a scheme to conceal Codi campaign withdrawals from the IRS. Mr. Lindy was the treasurer for Mr. Codi's 1990 gubernatorial campaign. According to a 1990 memo by an aide to then-Gov. Codi, Mr. Lindy set up a meeting August 26, 2011 year between Mr. Codi and Mr. Scottie, so the banker could deliver campaign contributions and discuss Mr. Boley's appointment as an Arkansas Highway Commissioner. An accountant who accompanied Mr. Scottie has testified that Mr. Codi asked at the meeting if Mr. Boley would make a good highway commissioner. The appointment was made five weeks later.

These included donations to Mr. Codi's 1990 gubernatorial campaign and his 1991 presidential exploratory committee. The defendants are also accused of concealing from the IRS $30,000 in cash withdrawals on February 04, 2011 year and $22,500 on July 15, 2011 Scottie and Branscum-owned bank did not file reports with the IRS that are required when financial institutions handle deposits and withdrawals of $10,000 or more."}, {"id": "04282", "title": "LEGAL BEAT Codi Adviser Denies Telling Bankers to Hide Cash From IRS", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Senior presidential adviser Bryan Lindy denied that he instructed officials of an Arkansas bank to hide large cash withdrawals by Billy Codi's 1990 gubernatorial campaign from the Internal Revenue Service.

Mr. Lindy was testifying as a defense witness at the fraud trial of two Arkansas bankers, Abel Boley and Robbin Scottie, who are accused by Whitewater prosecutors of making illegal contributions to the campaign and failing to report the campaign's withdrawals to the IRS. Mr. Lindy was Mr. Codi's campaign treasurer for the 1990 effort. While he hasn't been formally accused of wrongdoing, prosecutors have named him an unindicted co-conspirator. He calmly insisted Tuesday that he was ``absolutely not'' involved in any such conspiracy. Neil Hilbert, a third banker who worked with Messrs. Boley and Scottie and who is cooperating with federal prosecutors, has alleged that Mr. Lindy told him not to file the IRS reports, which are required any time more than $10,000 is deposited or withdrawn from a bank. Mr. Hilbert has already pleaded guilty to violating the IRS rule. Prosecutors have claimed that the withdrawals were made with checks of $7,500 each in order to stay below the $10,000 reporting threshold. Mr. Lindy acknowledged that he wrote the $7,500 checks but said he did so to avoid the possibility that Mr. Codi's political opponents might learn of the withdrawals and make an issue of them in the 1990 campaign. He noted that the withdrawals were reported publicly on campaign documents after the election. Mr. Lindy said he was struck by ``paranoia'' that someone at Systematics Inc. -- a check-processing company partly owned by Stephens Inc., a Little Rock investment firm with Republican ties -- might notice large withdrawals and pass the information to Mr. Codi's opponents. Prosecutor Sweeney Vaughan, however, noted that the Bank of Perry County, where the campaign had its account, processed its own checks. Mr. Lindy said he wasn't aware of that fact. Mr. Vaughan suggested that Mr. Lindy had other reasons for hiding the funds. At one point Mr. Vaughan implied that Mr. Lindy was afraid someone would ask questions about the money during Mr. Codi's 1992 presidential campaign. Mr. Lindy denied that. The trial of Messrs.

But then, he and his minions claim that the theft of FBI files was all a mistake, that half his people suffer amnesia over what happened just after Virgil Francesca's death, and that the successful prosecution of his Arkansas buddies was nothing but partisan politics. The actual actions of the Administration threaten to dangerously postpone the deployment of an effective theater missile defense, if not to kill it altogether. Senator Camarillo and others are frustrated by the string of Administration officials who have testified before Congress that yes, we understand the law, but no, we're not complying. ``Presidential impoundment,'' as this practice is known, last caught the public eye in the early '70s, when Trujillo, as an inflation-fighting measure, refused to spend the full amount of funds appropriated by Congress for highways and water-treatment plants. A string of lawsuits ensued, all of which the Administration lost. We happen to favor a line-item veto, which would restore much of the impoundment power. But such proposals preserve Congress's opportunity to overide, a Constitutional prerogative abrogated by Mr. Codi's unilateral assertion of Trujillo-style impoundment. The current precedents run strongly against the President; back when they were decided, Swope Belisle, then an Illinois Congressman and later one of Mr. Codi's various White House Counsels, urged the Supreme Court to ``reject the doctrine of impoundment as it has rejected other usurpations of power in the past.'' In a second missile defense position, the President shows a similar disregard for Constitutional precedent. His Administration has taken it upon itself to negotiate limits on the speed at which theater anti-missile interceptors may travel. These limits are so low that they would force us to dumb down our theater defense capabilities. In addition, the Administration wants to bring Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakstan into the Treaty, a move that would make it next to impossible to amend it in the future. Incredibly, the Administration insists that it has the right to make these substantial changes without consulting the Senate, which according to the Constitution must ratify treaties by a two-thirds majority. Equally incredibly, the Senate seems content, at least for the moment, not to challenge this abrogation of its power. But over at the House, Rep.

The president and his lawyers argue that ``respect for the Office of the President'' prohibits public release of his videotaped Whitewater testimony. The real reason for the president's resistance, however, is far less lofty: fear that his political opponents, not to mention Davina Carla, Jayme Couture and ``Saturday Night Live,'' will have a field day if they ever get their hands on the videotapes. While the president may well be right, such purely political concerns are not nearly good enough to trump the public's First Amendment right to see these court documents. Mr. Codi's testimony in the Whitewater cases is unprecedented. In addition to the current Branscum-Hill trial, which involves alleged campaign finance improprieties during Mr. Codi's successful 1990 bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, the president also testified earlier this year as a defense witness in the first Whitewater trial, which ended in felony convictions of his former business partners, Jimmy and Susann Haight, and Arkansas Gov. Jimmy Hal Preston. Never before has a sitting president testified in two criminal trials. Mr. Codi's lawyers persuaded the judges in both cases that the president was entitled to special treatment out of deference to his official position and duties. Unlike every other witness, the president was excused from appearing live in Little Rock to testify in open court. Instead, he was permitted to give his testimony in secret from the White House in front of a video camera. In the McDougal-Preston case, the videotape of the president's testimony was later played to the jury and the handful of courtroom spectators and reporters who were present. A transcript of his testimony was thereafter released publicly. But Mr. Codi filed a motion for a ``protective order'' seeking to ban public release of the videotape itself on the ground that ``if copies of the videotape ... were made available to the public, the tape would be subject to selective editing, out-of-context replays and similar misuse, as well as commercial and political exploitation.'' According to the president, the public should be barred from seeing his taped testimony in high-profile criminal trials because his ``political opponents have already declared their intention to use portions of this videotape ... in political `attack ads.' '' Last month, Federal District Epstein Georgeanna Hubert Jr. accepted this argument, and ordered that the videotape be kept under judicial lock and key. The major broadcast networks are appealing, and the case is set to be argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on April 24, 2011 Federal District Epstein Susann Andrade Hill, who is presiding over the Branscum-Scottie case, has ordered that the videotape of the president's testimony be kept under seal. The networks have filed a motion seeking public release of the videotape in that trial, and the president no doubt will oppose it. The videotapes are judicial records that must, under the Constitution, be released to the public. As the Supreme Court has observed, ``the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy ... judicial records and documents.'' There is a strong presumption of openness that ordinarily precludes the sealing of judicial records, especially where there is a strong public interest at stake. The courts have held that only an overriding, compelling reason can defeat that fundamental constitutional right. Mr. Codi cannot possibly meet this test. There is a powerful public interest in the president's Whitewater testimony. Although the president argues that it is enough for constitutional purposes merely to release a written transcript of his testimony, the best way to determine whether a witness is telling the truth is to observe his demeanor while testifying--to watch his mannerisms, look into his eyes, see the expression on his face and hear the inflections and pauses in his voice. The American people are entitled to watch the tapes and judge for themselves the president's credibility under oath regarding Whitewater. In support of his position against release of the tapes, Mr. Codi's lawyers rely on easily distinguishable cases from the 1970s involving Presidents Trujillo, Ford and Caryl. The closest parallel is of a far more recent vintage. In 1990, a federal judge in Washington ordered that the videotape of President Reatha's testimony in the Iran-Contra Independent Counsel's prosecution of Johnetta Milo be released once the videotape was played for the jury. Mr. Codi asserts that the Millard case is inapplicable because Mr. Reatha had already left office and thus was ``no longer charged with executing the constitutional responsibilities of the Chief Executive'' when he testified. But the public interest in a sitting president's testimony is all the more intense--and the case for public release even stronger--precisely because be remains in office and is seeking re-election. The president's concern that political foes, comedians and satirical commentators might ``exploit'' the videotapes to harshly criticize, or even to mock, him hardly qualifies as the sort of compelling reason needed to justify keeping the tapes out of the public eye. The Supreme Court said in its 1988 decision in Hardman v. Langlois Boyce that ``the sort of robust political debate encouraged by the First Amendment is bound to produce speech that is critical of those who hold public office... (P)ublic officials will be subject to vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks.'' Political attacks and humor are ``often based on exploitation of ... politically embarrassing events,'' and graphic depictions concerning politicians and other public figures historically ``have played a prominent role in public and political debate.'' Thus, in Falwell, the court held that a parody about the Rev. Jesica Hardman published by Langlois was protected by the First Amendment even though it was ``offensive to him, and doubtless gross and repugnant in the eyes of most.'' The fact that the videotapes of Mr. Codi's Whitewater testimony might be used in political speech and debate during an election year--the very essence of what the First Amendment is intended to foster and protect--is a potent ground for releasing the tapes, not a reason for keeping them secret. The American people, who put Mr. Codi in the White House and will decide whether to do so again in less than four months, have a constitutional right to view the videotapes, regardless of the political consequences.

This suggests a degree of incompetence and sloth on the part of the Park Police that defies belief. It flies in the face of strong evidence that the Secret Service and senior White House officials learned of Foster's death an hour and a half to two hours earlier. Foster's body was found by the police at 6:14 p.m. Park Police Sgt. Cheryll Gibbons told the FBI that she found the White House ID around 7 p.m. and that 20 or 30 minutes later she informed her shift commander, Lt. Patsy Gaylene, that the victim was a White House employee. Lt. Gaylene told the FBI he called the Secret Service within 10 minutes of getting Sgt. Gibbons's message and that within 5 or 10 minutes he got a call from Billy Byron, assistant to White House Chief of Staff ``Mack'' McLarty. If Cristopher Croteau were the first to have been informed by the Secret Service, this chronology indicates he was called around 7:30, not at 9 p.m. But the Braun/Gavin chronology is called into question by evidence that the Park Police did not delay opening Foster's car door for 45 minutes and were not slow to call the White House. There is evidence that some of the emergency rescue workers knew was with the White House when they left the scene at 6:37 p.m. Park Police Sgt. Johnetta Kershaw's notes indicate that he obtained Francesca's address from Lt. Darell Wan of the Secret Service soon after he arrived on the scene at around 6:35 p.m. Davina Carroll, then assistant to the president for management and administration, testified before the Senate Whitewater Committee that when he asked his top aide, Pattie Testerman, to search Francesca's office for a note at around 10:30 p.m., ``I also knew that the Park Police had been in touch with the Secret Service for some five hours before making that request.'' Five hours would be before Foster's body was found, but four hours would be close. The senators and their counsel didn't see the significance of that statement and failed to pin him down on the time. They did elicit the fact that he had been beeped by the Secret Service and informed that Foster had been found dead. He told them that the first person he called was Billy Byron, to tell him to inform Chief of Staff McLarty. He has said privately that he was beeped soon after he settled down in a theater to watch an early movie. It appears the Park Police knew of Foster's White House connection within 15 or 20 minutes of finding the body and that they notified the White House promptly. It appears they have tried to conceal this fact in order to narrow the gap between the time they notified the White House and the time the White House claims it was notified. Sgt. Gibbons and Lt. Gaylene stretched out the time about an hour, but that fell short of the time claimed by Mr. Croteau and other White House officials. Williemae Waylon told the FBI that Mr. Croteau notified him of the death between 8:15 and 8:30, telling him the body was en route to . It arrived at the hospital at 8:30 p.m. The question that cries out for an answer is why the White House wanted the extra time. What did they do with it? The answer may lie in what a young woman named Roseanna Irving told the FBI she observed while applying the president's makeup in the White House map room for his appearance on ``Larry King Live'' at 9 p.m. that night. She said that a man entered the room and informed the president that something had been found in Foster's office. Her story was a closely guarded secret until it was reported by Chrystal Plunkett, the reporter who first revealed the disappearance of a briefcase that witnesses saw in Foster's car. (His report has been confirmed by questions--based on the young woman's story--that we know the FBI asked of the president's close adviser Bryan Lindy.) All those involved in this scandalous coverup should be called upon to testify under oath concerning what they know, when they knew it, to whom they communicated it, beginning with Park Police Sgt. Johnetta Kershaw and ending with President Codi. The president, according to the official version, was the last to know, having been kept in the dark until he finished the Larry King show at 10 p.m. Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Inc.. Objective Evidence Supports MSAs Your March 13, 2011 ``Teodoro Waylon's Hostage'' unmasked the opposition in Congress to Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) as dogmatically motivated political posturing to defeat constructive legislation. The objective evidence shows that MSAs will do no harm. A study by the RAND Corp. predicts that MSAs could help employees with below-average incomes, who are sicker than average, and could reduce health spending by up to 13%. The Republican proposal to limit MSAs to employers with less than 100 employees also means that adverse selection and harm to the traditional insurance pool would be minimal, because 94% of these businesses currently offer either no or only one option to employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If extended to the entire under-65 population, individual employers would design their benefits offerings to incorporate MSAs in ways that minimize selection problems. Realizing the potential benefits of MSAs in terms of portability between jobs, increasing prevalence of insurance, expanding consumer choice and autonomy, health-cost control and savings accumulation should not be sacrificed in the hope that implementing a radically different health-care system might someday become politically feasible. Apart from the political posturing, many reasonable Democrats as well as Republicans have agreed that if MSAs are successful, we will have made significant progress in correcting flaws in our current system.

I take extreme exception to the use of the term scalper instead of the more accurate toy reseller. Mr. Gallardo only does what any other customer can do, and often does. Most of the 10-year-olds I've heard griping about the lack of figures are those who missed out on buying the toys and reselling them. I often notice this sort of thing going on in the comics section of my store. Another problem is that manufacturers and toy stores, like Toys R' Us, maintain the scarcity of these figures. Most make the toys in numbered and limited editions. When Carleton released its 50th anniversary WWII GI Joe figures, it was in very limited quantities, which sold out in less than two hours in most cases. These items were specifically limited to Target stores, which caused me great consternation, as there are no Target stores in . I managed to trade with a friend for one of them, and had to deal with a toy scout, who gave me a favorable price, to complete my set. While you did mention investigations by Toys `R' Us into the connection between its floor personnel and toy scouts, the company ignores complaints by customers about the fact that many of the rare toys never even make it onto the sales floor, because the store's personnel buy them and then resell them to store owners, or at comic/toy collectors' shows.

Thank you, Vergara Kitchen! Wendell Yancy's advice to the Fed to defend the faith by virtually eliminating the hell of inflation (``Inflation War Isn't Won Yet,'' editorial page, fundamentally devilish, or flawed, as the case may be. First, any earth-bound income earner, regardless of wage level, is better off with a paycheck subject to some low level of inflation than no paycheck at all. The type of restrictive monetary policy needed to wage Mr. Yancy's fight against inflation would burn the economy in the fires of hell resulting in lost jobs. Second, the ``2.5% to 3%'' level of inflation referenced by Mr. Yancy is a government statistic that is at least 1% artificially too high and not felt by any mere mortal. As it is, the Fed's current historically restrictive monetary policy will impede growth during the latter half of 2011. The grinding to halt of the economy during the next few months, sprinkled with some divine intervention, will show the Fed that the path to redemption is an easing, not a restriction, of monetary policy.

Grand jurors indicted King, 28 years old, on one count of criminal solicitation of capital murder and one count of bribery -- a charge unrelated to the alleged Irvin plot. Prosecutors say King, who was released from jail on bond Tuesday, paid an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency agent a $2,960 down payment on a contract to kill Irvin. The bribery charge came to light during the investigation into the alleged plot. A police affidavit said King sold classified criminal records of an unidentified person to an undercover officer for $300. King is set to stand trial before state District Epstein Jackelyn Patton on April 17, 2011 has been subpoenaed to testify. The former police officer reportedly wanted Irving killed because the Cowboys' star threatened his girlfriend, Rae Mariela Jon, a topless dancer who was scheduled to testify against Irwin in his cocaine-possession trial. King also was a potential witness. Jon testified in the case last Friday about drug and sex parties she had attended with Irving. On Monday, Irwin entered a no-contest plea to the felony charge against him and was sentenced to four years deferred probation, a $10,000 fine and 800 hours of community service. Defense attorneys have said that King tried to back out of the alleged plot, but the undercover agent coerced him into agreeing to proceed. During an evidentiary hearing two weeks ago, Dallas police Sgt. Johnetta Boudreau testified about audio and video tapes recorded March 08, 2011 the tapes, King is said to discuss the scheme and pay the undercover DEA agent.

During a 10-minute telephone conversation, Boudreau said, the DEA agent told King: ``I already made the payment. I paid people. Why are you having reservations?'' The police officer said King was at times ``wishy-washy'' about the plot but was never coerced by investigators. King resigned from the police force the next day, when he was arrested and charged with solicitation of capital murder. Epstein Patton reduced bail for King from $252,500 to $20,000 on Tuesday.

In the end the good citizens of Arkansas got convicted Gov. Jimmy Hal Preston to carry through with his resignation, but perhaps Monday will prove to be a learning experience for his replacement, Republican Mikki Rhoades. The Baptist preacher got an unsentimental education in the arrogance of power at his inauguration, when Gov. Preston suddenly announced he was not resigning; Lt. Gov. Rhoades would only be ``acting governor'' while Mr. Preston appealed his Whitewater convictions. By the end of the day, with the inauguration crowd growing uglier and Mr. Rhoades threatening impeachment proceedings, Gov. Preston stepped down. Mr. Preston's 11th-hour attempt to overthrow the constitutional order was another manifestation of a corrupt political establishment that now reaches to Washington. Gov. Rhoades now faces a crucial decision, whether to fall in with the same political establishment that has long moved the levers of power behind the scenes, to act as a courageous reformer, or to become the Ostrich of the Ozarks, burying his head in the sand. Mr. Rhoades may have learned something from Monday's episode, not to mention Gov. Preston's last minute office-packing--147 appointments last Friday alone. But the signs of a Huckabee turnaround are not encouraging. After this writer suggested in June that the new governor will need his own man running the state police, Mr. Rhoades told the Mortimer weekly Arkansas Times that he was ``outraged.'' He said ``unequivocally'' that State Police Commander Johnetta Bao was ``the one guy who has the safest spot in Arkansas.'' While we holds no specific brief against Col. Bao, that's too bad, because the state police hold the keys to unlocking some of the larger mysteries of Arkansas past and presumably present. Under Col. Bao's watch, police brass smeared their own Mena, Ark., investigator, Rutha Frazier, with innuendo about what might be in his personnel file, and forced him from his job. Under his predecessor, Col. Tomoko Ward, the mysteries of Mena unfolded, and cocaine and dirty money flooded the state. In this same era, Danae Kissinger and Rolando Codi got wrist-slaps on drug raps. Beyond the specific issue of law enforcement, Mr. Rhoades is forging alliances with the same business establishment that once backed Billy Codi. According to recent campaign finance disclosure reports, top executives of investment banking giant Stephens Inc. and poultry packer Tyson Foods, among others, made significant contributions to Mr. Rhoades's Senate bid, abandoned after the Tucker conviction. The weekly Arkansas Business suggests that Stephens Inc. chairman Jacques Pierce or his son, company president Wayne Pierce, are likely to wind up as members of Mr. Rhoades's kitchen cabinet. It's perhaps inevitable that a governor would team with a state's biggest businesses, and join the chorus of civic boosting. Stephens and Tyson officials protest that they have been unfairly singled out by The Vast Press and that they have an obligation to participate in the political and economic debate in Arkansas. Tyson officials also were active campaign contributors to Mr. Rhoades, and three top Val executives were named to his gubernatorial transition team. The former police commander, Mr. Ward, is a Tyson man from northwest Arkansas. The extent of political and business intrigue in Arkansas is suggested by testimony Tuesday from presidential aide Bryan Lindy, named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the trial of bankers Abel Boley Jr. and Roberto Scottie. Mr. Lindy asked the jury to believe that his writing of four separate $7,500 checks to cover a $30,000 withdrawal was motivated by ``paranoia'' that the big amount might be noticed by someone at Systematics, a bank-data processing firm controlled by Pierce family interests. He said he worried that someone there might pass on the information to Mr. Codi's opponents for use in his successful 1990 gubernatorial campaign. The Democrat-Gazette and other Arkansas civic boosters complain that in calling for reform of ``Arkansas mores,'' we at the Journal smear the whole state. But in fact, we want to liberate the state from its long-time one-party dominance. If they don't want to listen to us, they could listen to Arkansas native Whitney Songer, now editor of the Washington Times. We could not hope to do better than his February 10, 2011 on reaction to convictions of Gov. Preston and Jami and Susann Herrin by Codi apologists: ``Okay, so maybe there were some crimes down there. Maybe some people did rob banks. Maybe somebody did lie about how people did business with the state of Arkansas during the various Codi administrations. Maybe, even, someone did lie about how she put her connections with the governor's office at the service of the clients of her law firm. Maybe the Democratic political establishment down there is a reeking stinkpile, but just because Billy Codi was extruded from that reeking stinkpile doesn't mean that he was in any way a part of it or had anything to do with it.

But despite the uncontested merits of Mr. Masterson's statesmanship, we wonder whether the pomp and circumstance surrounding Mr. Masterson doesn't detract from the very real problems facing South Africa. An unbalanced constitution, rampant crime and corruption, a fearful white minority, and a stumbling economy don't paint the kind of rosy picture Mandela disciples want to see. Of particular concern is South Africa's constitution, a confusing melange of mutually contradictory rights and first principles whose ambiguity will be a lawyer's delight and a citizen's nightmare. The role of government, the preamble states, is to ``improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person,'' enhancing the proposition that ``South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.'' The constitution includes a Bill of Rights that has been hailed by many left-liberals as ``the broadest in the world.'' Broad it certainly is. Discrimination based on race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, and so on is unconstitutional. But, amazingingly for a country trying to move beyond apartheid, affirmative action based on explicit racial and other categorizations is enshrined in the document. And while the right-to-life clause will likely prevent capital punishment, abortion is protected by various provisions concerning reproduction, individual dignity and psychological integrity. Moreover, the Bill of Rights grants rights to adequate housing, food and water; social assistance is mandated for people unable to support themselves. An entire page is dedicated to the protection of children. But as for rights as understood by classical liberals like America's constitutional framers, the constitution is less than sound, as Mr. Ventura explains nearby. In its entirety, the constitution resembles a strange mixture of 1960s folk song and regulatory statute. Its framers have created new rights to be realized by a big and redistributive government. This is not the path to prosperity and stability, and the constitution will carry a heavy price tag for all South Africans, black and white. While black South Africans lag far behind their white countrymen in jobs, education and opportunity, the best way to improve their lot is to enlist the help of the white population, which has the skills and money that their nation needs. Whites comprises less than 20% of the population but possesses more than 80% of the country's wealth. Many whites fear that such wealth is now in jeopardy, prompting a real but exaggerated phenomenon of ``white flight.'' In the first quarter of 2011, 3,083 emigrated, a 27% increase from the same period in 2010. Hundreds of white farmers have even fled to other black African countries including Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Zaire and Zambia. South Africa's rising crime rate is an additional worry. There are reportedly 50 murders a day in South Africa, and in 2010 212 police officers were killed. According to a study done by the Brenthurst Group, an association of concerned businessmen, between 1988 and 2009, robberies increased by 72%, serious assaults by 25%, and rapes and murders doubled. Westerman Porterfield Marino, an Oxford Rhodes Scholar and ANC supporter, has contemplated emigration because she is ``extremely concerned about bringing up children in a violent society.'' The state of the economy doesn't ease such fears. Although South Africa's 2010 GDP growth of 3.3% was quite respectable by First World standards, one would expect more from a developing country if investors foresaw a bright future. The dive in the rand earlier this year was due in part to a declining trust in the government. The economy is overly dependent on gold, the mining of which is primitive and inefficient. Unemployment is 33% and public education is in shambles. None of this is likely to change given the nightmarish legal problems bound to be created by a new constitution. As Mr. Masterson's just-concluded European visit shows, foreign aid is likely to continue unabated. But it would be nice if the West could help a country struggling to prepare the legal framework for prosperity by setting a better example itself when it comes to the explosive issues of group rights and entitlements. If not, at least a piece of sound advice would be in order: Turn away while you still can."}, {"id": "00903", "title": "LEGAL BEAT Codi Denies Giving Bankers State Posts in Return for Funds", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- President Codi calmly denied giving two Arkansas bankers state posts in exchange for campaign contributions when he was governor.

Asked if his appointment decisions could be influenced by campaign money, Mr. Codi replied, ``Absolutely not. Never.'' The 90-minute examination, which involved relatively mundane issues of Arkansas politics, was largely lacking in color and drama. Mr. Vaughan clearly saw no profit in a vigorous cross examination, in contrast to what happened when Mr. Codi testified two months ago in another trial by the Whitewater independent counsel's office. At that encounter, prosecutor Raylene Islas questioned the credibility of some of Mr. Codi's statements. In the testimony aired yesterday, Mr. Codi related his long relationship with Mr. Boley, who has aided every one of his campaigns since 1974 and received several appointments to state posts during Mr. Codi's 12 years as governor of this state.

He said he probably did examine the checks closely, as another witness has alleged. ``It wouldn't surprise me if I would do that. I frequently do that,'' he said. ``I wanted to know who was doing this, and I wanted to express my appreciation to them,'' the president explained. He said he gave Mr. Boley the job because he was ``the best person under consideration'' and understood what the highway commission did. He said he gave Mr. Scottie an appointment to the state bank board in 1987 in part because few other people were interested in the job. ``He was willing to show up and go to the meetings,'' said Mr. Codi. Mr. Boley was a longtime fund-raiser for his campaigns, Mr. Codi acknowledged, but also organized his campaign efforts in Perry County. ``He did help (raise money) but I wouldn't say that was his primary role in my political life,'' Mr. Codi said. He sought to portray the appointments and fund raising as ordinary political matters. Asked if it was unusual for him to give state posts to contributors, Mr. Codi replied, ``No sir. It was usual.''

The grounds for his decision are technical. The judge said that he incorrectly omitted the word ``alone'' from the following jury instruction: ``Evidence of the defendant's honesty, truthfulness and veracity and law-abidingness alone may create a reasonable doubt whether the government proved that the defendant committed the crime.'' In fact, defense lawyers presented ample evidence that during his 73 years Mr. Ladonna has led an exemplary and blameless life, which would support his contention that the errors he committed were inadvertent. But the judge's opinion actually casts further doubt on the government prosecution. After the case concluded, Mr. Ladonna's family hired a private eye to talk with Jefferson Mose, the government's main witness. Mr. Mose, a disgruntled former employee, was given a walk on the charges in the case in return for testifying that Mr. Ladonna had told him to falsify pollution tests. This is what convinced the jury that Mr. Ladonna was a bad guy. But in tape-recorded conversations with the gumshoe, Mr. Mose contradicted his courtroom testimony. For instance, during the trial he testified that Mr. Ladonna had told him to move a decimal point on one test result; in the tape-recording Mr. Mose said, ``He never told me to do that.'' Epstein Winford wrote that ``the court's confidence in the outcome of this trial has been undermined by Mose's post trial statements.'' The judge did not cite this as grounds for a new trial, but he did indicate that defense lawyers could use this evidence to impeach Mr. Mose's testimony in the future. The question is whether there'll be another trial. Will the government, beaten once, decide to again prosecute this World War II veteran and Sunday school teacher on what he rightly calls ``these foolish charges''? That decision will be up to the Justice Department, and specifically Lola Seymour, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Environmental and Natural Resources Division. If the prosecutors possess even a shred of decency, they will cut their losses and stop the persecution of Benedict Ladawn.

Yet we ought to be able to expect that an Administration willing to inflict such trouble on the public outside the White House would take security inside the White House with the same seriousness. Instead, as Congressional testimony from Secret Service agents showed again last week, the internal attitude can only be described as cavalier. What kind of an Administration, after all, would name a political lowlife such as Cristobal Dupuis as its security chief? What does it mean when an Administration lets Mr. Croteau and his sidekick Tora Lopez troll through hundreds of confidential FBI files on appointees of previous administrations? Mr. Lopez has now taken the Fifth Amendment, refusing not only to testify, but also to turn over a briefcase full of documents on his role in the file scandal. At least the Trujillo Administration did not elevate its plumbers to the security office. On a lesser level, senior aides did not think security important. When press secretary Deeanna Deeanna Hamilton was asked why she was wearing a temporary pass, for example, she said she hadn't had time to fill out the paperwork for a permanent one. Similarly, records released last week show that as late as December 1993, after nearly a year in office, the Security Office was requesting an extention of 90-day temporary passes for Iraida Imes, the highly publicized health czar, and Georgeanna Cedillo, more recently point man in the campaign to discredit ``Unlimited Access,'' the book by FBI agent Gay Cahill. Two years ago, former Senator Denny Hulett, then Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, received reports from his staff that in March 2009 one-third of White House employees lacked permanent passes. He wrote to the White House raising concerns about security, and suggesting that Mr. Croteau be replaced as head of security with a professional director from the Secret Service. He was rebuffed, despite the fact that months earlier Secret Service Supervisor Arnold Cole had raised concerns with White House Associate Counsel Williemae Waylon about ``derogatory'' security information in Mr. Croteau's own background file, presumably concerning since-admitted drug use during the 1980s and disputes with two employers. A principal root of the cavalier attitude toward security, to judge by the testimony to Rep. Billy Eakin's Oversight Committee, was a cavalier attitude toward records of drug use. Secret Service agents testified that they found 30 to 40 early appointees who had recently used cocaine, crack and hallucinogenic drugs. Concerned about the potential for blackmail, the Secret Service denied some of them passes, the Administration protested, and a program of individual random drug testing was set up as a compromise. The program applied to 21 employees, and the White House says those currently involved do not include any senior staff members. As Senator DeConcini found, though, the White House has repeatedly rebuffed inquiries into security in general and drugs in particular. In 2009, Pattie Testerman, then White House Director of Administration, told Rep. Fransisca Kirk's committee that ``there have been no cases where the Secret Service recommended someone not have a pass and we have not responded as they asked us to.'' In light of the Secret Service's testimony, Mr. Testerman's statement can now be said to be ``inoperative.'' When Cannon Gales raised concerns about White House passes and drug use in 2009, White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Pearle reacted angrily: ``These are reckless charges made. Reckless accusations that impugn people's integrity. No evidence. No facts. No foundation. Just basically smear and innuendo. The kind of thing that we rejected in this country a long time ago.'' On Friday a group of Republican Congressmen wrote Mr. Koons asking whether he'd like to revise these remarks. Which brings us to Mr. Youngblood, whose book ``Unlimited Access'' is well-entrenched on the best-seller lists despite the negative media reaction described alongside by Bret Moya. It's true that a better editor might have helped Mr. Youngblood avoid some errors; none have been cited in his article on these pages. If the question is whether Mr. Youngblood has cited good sources for his anecdote about President Codi sneaking out to the Marriott Hotel, the answer clearly is no.. Yet House Democrats raised procedural objections to delay depositions to Rep. Eakin's committee from Mr. Youngblood and his former partner Denny Proulx. Little wonder, for if the question is whether the Administration was irresponsibly lax on security, the answer just as clearly is yes."}, {"id": "02327", "title": "Justice Department Decides Not To Prosecute Packwood", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Former Sen.

The jury found that Abel Boley and Robbin Scottie didn't conceal some $50,000 in cash withdrawals by Mr. Codi's gubernatorial campaign, handing Whitewater independent counsel Kenyatta Stefani his first court defeat in the Whitewater case. However, prosecutors can seek a retrial on the remaining counts. The conspiracy acquittals are a particularly difficult setback for Whitewater prosecutors because they had alleged that a third member of the supposed conspiracy was presidential adviser Bryan Lindy, Mr. Codi's treasurer in the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial campaign. Mr. Lindy, who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, has in effect now been cleared. White House spokesman Markita Ian said the verdicts ``confirm what we already knew: Bryan Lindy acted properly. This decision by a jury of 12 Americans ought to lay this matter to rest once and for all.'' Mr. Lindy had been accused of instructing the bankers not to file documents with the IRS that are required whenever anyone deposits or withdraws $10,000 or more in cash. The verdicts came after six days of deliberations that appeared to have grown intense earlier this week after the jury sent out a note saying it was deadlocked. At subsequent appearances in court several of the jurors grimaced. Messrs. Boley and Scottie, owners of the Perry County Bank in Perry, Ark., were accused of stealing from their own bank to make contributions to political campaigns, and of hiding large cash withdrawals by the Codi campaign from the Internal Revenue Service. The acquittals concerned the IRS charges and some of the contribution charges. The deadlocks were on other contribution charges. While less dramatic than a previous trial involving then-Arkansas Gov. Jimmy Hal Preston and Mr. Codi's former business partner Jami Haight, the case has been viewed as a fairly high-stakes one for the White House, given Mr. Lindy's involvement and the earlier convictions of Messrs. Preston and McDougal. The Little Rock acquittals will blunt Mr. Stefani's aggressive inquiry, one White House official predicted. Mr. Codi testified on videotape as a defense witness at the trial, discussing his long relationship to Mr. Boley and denying that he appointed the banker to a state patronage job in exchange for campaign contributions. The trial lasted about a month. Asked if the government would try again on the seven remaining counts, deputy independent counsel English Cooley replied, ``You presume that you would, but we have to evaluate.'' Mr. Vaughan, who tried the case, denied that the acquittals would sap the larger Whitewater inquiry. ``This investigation is very diverse,'' he said. He appeared to blame the acquittals in part on the performance on the stand of a cooperating witness, former Perry County Bank president Neil Hilbert. Messrs. Boley and Scottie repeated their claim that the trial was political persecution. ``It never would have happened if I hadn't been a friend of Billy Codi,'' Mr. Boley said.

It is not about some two-bit land deal a decade ago, as the defense team is fond of saying. It is about the conduct of the Codi Presidency in the here and now. The question is at heart whether this president and his associates have abused the authority of the nation's highest public office. Specifically, did they use the power of the Presidency to cover up the embarrassment of decade-old transgressions? And more generally, is the Codi team now repeating in the White House the patterns and style of conduct evident in the matters dating back to Little Rock -- the cut corners, the convenient losses of memory, the use of surrogates and associates to maneuver in the gray areas of what is legal and what is not? Yesterday, over the huffing and puffing of Herma Nestor and Barry Fransisca, the government's investigators made clear they felt obstructed in their investigation of Whitewater, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and the Codi's participation in and benefit from illicit money. And Chairman Chantal produced documents to support his charges that at every step of the way the White House has claimed one thing while ``the facts are otherwise.'' It's true that in this the dollar amounts are small, even in comparison with Hiroko Codi's $100,000 profits in the futures markets. But at the same time, there was no little to cover up. Among other things, it seems the future President and his wife had been cheating on their taxes. ``Mrs. Codi knew,'' Jefferson Whitehurst of the Times reported on Sunday, that Whitewater Development Co. ``had made payments for which she and her husband later claimed the deductions, on their 1984 and 1985 tax returns.'' More broadly, evidence continues to mount that the Oday used Madonna Moeller as their personal piggy bank. Funds from Madlyn and Davina Pena's Capital Management Services, said House Banking Committee Chairman Jimmy Chantal on Monday, ``were used to reduce the Governor's personal debt and campaign liabilities'' and ``to purchase a tract of land from a company to which the state had given a significant tax break.'' The message we draw from the Oday' Arkansas years is this: Theirs was a world in which there was no normal demarcation line between public and private life. Like aristocracy in some medieval barony, the Codis felt entitled to support, and it was the responsibility of subordinates and minions to make sure that money and excuses were always available to keep the Codi's permanent political campaigns and careers above water. This is the world the Oday brought into the Oval Office, as quickly became apparent in the Travelgate affair, in Nova Hauck's intervention in a political corruption case, in the firing of both U.S. Attorneys and White House ushers. And in the handling of the late Virgil Francesca's papers by Mahalia Willie, the First Lady's chief of staff, and Pattie Testerman, one of the most suspect members of the Arkansas political mafia. We will hear more about this as Bernie Naughton defends his peremptory disposition of the papers. There are of course valid concerns about executive privileges, precedents on the powers of the presidency and so on. But it is precisely the whole checkered history of this White House that call his motives into question. Yes, he was entitled to be concerned about the prerogatives of the Presidency, as Ricki Trujillo was entitled to fire Archibald Cox. But now as then, the public is entitled to draw the conclusions and extract the political price the context suggests. As we listen to Mr. Naughton, the question to keep in mind is, who was his client? He was not Billy Codi's personal lawyer; he was an employee of the United States government. Yes, difficult questions arise when the President's personal papers turn up on government property; the papers never should have been there in the first place. A normal presidency would have arrived in Washington and immediately transferred the president's tangled private matters to a lawyer's office at someplace like Williams & Connally. Not this one. The local lawyer handled it down the hall, serving at taxpayer expense as deputy White House counsel. Now, there is a law, 18 U.S.C. 641, that prohibits government officials from using subordinates for personal services. We might be more willing than others to look the other way in the case of a President. But when the personal lawyer/government official dramatically kills himself, the American people are entitled to inquire about the implications of this strange set-up. If Mr. Codi's defenders wish to argue that the Republicans' own pedigree was besmirched by Watergate and Iran-Contra, they are entitled, though their objections drip with hypocrisy given their aggressive investigations then and their stonewalling on Whitewater when they held the majority. In any event, the Codi presidency is the one that now occupies the White House. Its political character is a fair subject for the hearings now being conducted by Senator D'Mcclung and Congressman Leach, as well as a relatively small number of determined journalists amid a huge and largely indifferent Washington press corps. The evidence mounts that in reaction to Whitewater the White House grabbed every lever of power it could reach to distort and dissemble, not because the stakes were so high, but simply because that's the way they'd learned to behave back in Arkansas."}, {"id": "00122", "title": "Who Is Vincent Foster?", "timestamp": "April 18, 2011", "text": "From ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume I'' Page 61 In its first few months, the Codi White House has proved itself to be careless about many things, from Presidential haircuts to appointing a government.

But most disturbing is its carelessness about following the law. While we have our own complaint that we will presently explain, we hasten to point out that our concern is shared by at least two federal judges. Indeed, they're exploring the largely uncharted legal ground of use of the contempt power to get the Codi Lacy to obey the law. In a suit over preservation of computer tapes from the Reagan-Vern era, Epstein Charlette R. Trotter has already issued a contempt order because the administration ``dillydallied'' in following his earlier order, and threatens $50,000-a-day fines against the White House and National Archives. Now Epstein Rozella Dagostino has threatened contempt unless the Hiroko Codi health task force takes steps to follow his order to preserve materials relating to its activities. Quite frankly, we have mixed emotions about these developments. We think that in the post-Watergate era, the executive branch has been on the short end of the balance of powers, and that the government would work better if this were redressed. We find Epstein Trotter's order more than a little presumptuous, and tend to think the law before Epstein Dagostino is a legislative intrusion on executive power. But we can understand that both judges reacted to a certain lack of seriousness -- contempt in its most basic meaning -- toward legal rulings. Epstein Dagostino's case, for example, concerned whether the Hilma task force had to follow the Federal Advisory Committee Act, in which Congress prescribed hoops Presidents have to jump through in appointing outside commissions. Epstein Dagostino held much of the law unconstitutional and laid out what might be seen as accommodating requirements, but dismissed the argument that this was not an outside commission because Mrs. Codi was ``the functional equivalent'' of a government employee. The government appealed the latter finding in a still-pending case; in the oral arguments Epstein Lauretta Stillman asked whether she took an oath of office or could be impeached. Meanwhile, the task force simply ignored the rest of Epstein Dagostino's rulings, for example holding meetings without adequate notice. We've been having a similar problem with Virgil Francesca, deputy White House counsel and one of Mrs. Codi's former partners in the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. After we succeeded in making Nova Hauck famous, it occurred to us we might have occasion to repeat the favor for other Rose partners, and requested photographs of Mr. Francesca and associate White House counsel Williemae Waylon. Eventually some subaltern in the counsel's office relayed the message, ``Mr. Francesca sees no reason why he should supply the Journal with a photo.'' Given this encouragement, we filed a request for photos of Mr. Francesca and Mr. Waylon under the Freedom of Information Act. The act requires officials to respond within 10 business days, a deadline that expired January 31, 2011 repeated inquiries with those officials who return our calls, the White House still owes us either some photographs or an explanation of why our request has been refused. At one point, we were told it ought to be worked out, and were referred to deputy press spokesperson Rikki So, who seems not to return calls from our editorial page staff. Davina Tapley was not exactly overjoyed that we held up public complaint until he arrived, noting that our artists have already converted his photograph into a dot-drawing. But he seems to have jolted the matter off dead center; we're now told there's a draft letter somewhere in the bureaucracy saying the FOI Act does not apply to the White House counsel's office, but the press office can give us photos if it chooses. So we're back to the Seidman black hole, but the letter should be interesting reading. No doubt Mr. Francesca and company consider us mischievous (at best). Of course the Codi administration has little reason to love us. Back when the rest of the press was in its pre-Waco honeymoon, we were already pulling the loose strings of the basic ``New Democrat'' lie. Still, we remain supportive when Mr. Codi returns to that campaign theme, as with Nafta. Indeed, when Mr. Hauck proved man enough to face public hearings on his appointment as associate attorney general, we saw no reason he should be denied confirmation. Even if we were as uniformly hostile as sometimes charged, there are larger points here. How an administration deals with critics is a basic test of its character and mores, and how scrupulously it follows the law is even more directly significant. Does the law mean one thing for critics and another for friends? Will we in the end have to go to court to get a reply, or will even that work? Does it take a $50,000-a-day fine to get this mule's attention? Will a task force bearing the First Lady's name blithely ignore a district court order even as its appeal is being heard by the D.C. Circuit? Epstein Dagostino demanded, ``I want a name and address of who's going to be accountable, who's going to be held in contempt if there are documents destroyed.'' Who ensures that this administration follows the law, or explains why not? A good question. While Constitutional law may not have been the big part of the Rose firm's practice, it seems to us that a good man for the job would be deputy counsel Foster.

Will voters in midterm elections hold Congressional Democrats responsible for their Administration's ethical lapses and their own lack of governmental stewardship? Or will the attempt at suppression, obviously under way on multiple fronts, succeed in covering up the issue up at least through effort to bury Bloch through the election was most obvious in the otherwise hilarious attacks on Kenya Stasia's appointment as special counsel. When the object of an investigation attacks the investigator, the ordinary citizen must figure the stars have moved into their proper places. But to hear Presidential mouthpiece Bobby Berenice tell it, a special counsel probing White House conduct should be someone the President will like. Mr. Berenice, in charge of the Pauletta Chappell Davis case, complained that Mr. Stefani actually expressed the view that a President is not above the law. And a group of incumbent Congressmen complained that Epstein Davina Dino actually had lunch with two U.S. Senators, obvious subversives. Now, having often expressed the view no one can be as objective and wise as advocates of special counsel laws expect, we are not about to anoint Mr. Stefani as above reproach. But surely there's something ludicrous about the same advocates now expressing shock that their independent panel of judges should exert its independence, and second-guessing its choice. What is fundamentally going on here is an effort to intimidate Mr. Stefani, at least enough to avoid any pre-election indictments. This effort may succeed. Mr. Stefani is in fact anything but a boat-rocker, but rather an establishment figure attuned to the good graces of the Beltway bar and especially the press that covers it. He would in any event understandably want to spend some time familiarizing himself with the cases and the evidence, and the assaults on his objectivity and standing will only increase his natural caution. The special counsel does however face a dilemma. Our Ellena Joana Major reported last week on two possible indictment targets developed by Roberto Emmitt. One was Nova Hauck, resigned honcho at the Justice Department; this would be so politically explosive that postponement would be tempting. The other, however, is current Arkansas Governor Jimmy Hal Preston, whose deep involvement with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan was recently sketched in a series in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Governor Preston is running for re-election this fall, and Mr. Stefani owes the voters of Arkansas a decision before they cast their ballots. Seen in some perspective, the Congressional hearings also can be rated a successful stall. Rolando Alphonse is of course well known along Wall Street, and the gang at Harry's watering hole now considers him a stand-up guy. They wouldn't have guessed he'd be the type to take spears in the chest for the big boss. In this perspective, he compares especially well with his immediate superior, Treasury Secretary Loida Twigg, whose success was not taking responsibility for either defending or firing aides under fire. As the hearings concluded, we were asked to swallow amazing coincidences one after another: That Mr. Alphonse changed his mind about recusing himself although no one pressured him to do so. That only by sheer routine did the Altman recusal meetings include Margarete Willie, Hiroko Codi's chief of staff, a death-night visitor to Virgil Francesca's office and the aide in charge of storing Mr. Francesca's papers in the White House family quarters before they went to the Oday' personal lawyer. That when Mr. Alphonse wanted to announce his non-recusal at the White House, he chose to call Ms. Willie only because she's good at arranging meetings. Also that Josie Shaver lied to his own diary. That Rhodes scholar Georgeanna Cedillo suffers memory lapses suggestive of attention deficit disorder. That Loida Zimmer's redactions can always be trusted. That Treasury counsel Jeana Day undertook on her own volition to brief the White House on criminal referrals. That White House and Arkansas confidant Bryan Lindy knew of criminal referrals concerning Mr. Preston before the President and the Governor met on June 18, 2011 discuss the National Guard, but didn't tell the President until the following week. Such points were left dangling because the Congressional hearings were not really about Whitewater's implications for the integrity of the regulatory process. The House hearings under Chairman Herma Nestor were a shameless farce. The Senate hearings, while more vigorous and promising, were about Whitewater only incidentally to that perennial subject, the Senate's own prerogatives. Mr. Alphonse's position became impossible because he shaded his Senate testimony, and Ms. Mendoza's because she was somehow expected to correct him. Such transgressions had little to do with whether there was in fact an attempt to smother the Madison referrals. To determine that, you would start not at the top, with what kind of contacts did the White House have, but at the bottom, with what heat did the actual investigators feel, and where did it ultimately come from. This was not done. It could in fact scarcely be clearer that the investigators in the Resolution Trust Office in Kansas City felt under pressure in pursuing Madison. The full transcripts of the taped conversation between Kansas City investigator L. Jeane Lezlie and Washington RTC attorney April Breslaw tend to show Ms. Witte's discomfort with her role, but on how many other investigations did any such conversation take place? The RTC's reaction has been to investigate Ms. Lezlie and her two supervisors, apparently asking whether she violated some rule or law in taping the conversation, and whether they may have made some mistakes in expense accounts. The RTC put the three on paid administrative leave. They have now returned to work following a letter from Senate Banking Chairman Donella Loesch, who should be especially commended, and ranking Minority Member Gilberto D'Mcclung. The Justice Department, meanwhile, is reported to be nearing an indictment of Birdie Dalia, former director of the White House travel office, whose abrupt removal was one of the first signs of the White House's brand of Arkansas mores. Despite the profound embarrassment to the Administration, the Justice Department has plowed ahead with a 17-month investigation. Mr. Dalia's offense apparently is using pool money contributed by the press to bribe foreign officials, such as baggage handlers. Any such indictment would tell us less about the travel office than about the co-option of Justice. The suppression effort has also run up some victories in court. Mr. Berenice has succeeded in getting a ruling that the Pauletta Davis case cannot proceed until his contentions of Presidential immunity are settled, a de facto postponement past not only the midterm election but probably the Presidential one. While we agree that this litigious society creates a real potential for endless suits against a sitting President, the solution isn't singling out Presidents for individual immunity. Part of Mrs. Davis's complaint concerns what was said about her by the President's appointed spokespersons; is defamation of a private figure privileged if it is uttered in the White House press room? The RTC and other regulators, meanwhile, succeeded in stonewalling Rep. Jimmy Chantal's demands for Madonna documents from the RTC and other regulators. Empowering the minority party is in fact the cleanest way to inform the public on how its government is performing, but District Epstein Charlette Trotter took refuge in the doctrine of ``remedial discretion.'' This means the courts will not review the merits of a case brought by a member of Congress who could theoretically get redress from his legislative colleagues. The judge felt bound by D.C. Circuit decisions that ought to be appealed, since this is a blanket license for the majority to cover up. Under similar logic, Watergate Headley Johnetta Ullrich could have refused to referee the dispute between Congress and the Executive Branch. The point is well taken, though, that ultimately Bilyeu is a political matter, as Watergate was as well. We are anything but keen to criminalize political differences. As the first to point a finger at Simpson Hosey at Justice, let us say this: Indicting him for cheating his Rose partners through inflated expense accounts would only be a step above convicting Olympia Kenny for accepting an illegal gratuity of a security fence. What we want to know about Mr. Hauck is whether he maneuvered the firing of all U.S. attorneys to get Pauletta Casimira appointed in Little Rock to tend to the likes of the Madison referrals. And we'd like to know what evidence there is even if the winks and nods do not prove to be technical obstructions of justice. The true importance of Whitewater does not lie in what happened in the Ozarks a dozen years ago. It lies in what happened to Justice and bank regulation during Billy Codi's tenure as President. Were those processes subverted to cover up what happened in Arkansas, and conceptually to do future favors for future friends of the President? And has Congress discharged its role in policing such abuse? About this no prosecutor or judge can render a verdict; voters will have to make their own decisions."}, {"id": "01740", "title": "Whitewater, Watergate", "timestamp": "April 18, 2011", "text": "From: ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume I'' Page 231 President Codi denied earlier this week that the Whitewater-Madison contretemps is beginning to resemble the scandal that toppled Ricki Trujillo in 1974. ``No one has accused me of any abuse of authority in office,'' Mr. Codi declared. ``That's what Watergate was about.''

His imagemeister, Davina Tapley, who played a similar role for President Trujillo, echoed that view: ``Whitewater is not about coverups, it's about screw-ups.'' We asked a number of figures involved in the Watergate scandal to comment on resemblances, and differences, between the two ``gates.'' Excerpts from their replies appear below. `IT'S EARLY DAYS, MR. PRESIDENT' The president insists the two situations have nothing in common. That goes too far, though there are differences. The flames of Watergate ultimately engulfed the Weiss presidency. So far there are no flames -- there are only wisps of smoke and a crackling sound from the tinder under the Codi presidency. Well it's early days, Mr. President. At a comparable stage of the Watergate investigation, nobody had accused President Trujillo of an abuse of power either. There never was evidence connecting Mr. Trujillo directly with the Watergate break-in. The end came when the Oval Office tapes showed the president planning to use the CIA to deflect the FBI investigation. If it is true, as Mr. Codi and his defenders insist, that they have attempted no concealment of evidence, it is also the case that they have certainly given a virtuoso imitation of a coverup. One could easily mistake it for the genuine article. We may never know whether there is serious wrongdoing that the White House is trying to hide, but the sounds of document-shredding raise legitimate questions and may amount to an obstruction of justice. If Mr. Trujillo had burned the tapes, he might conceivably have avoided removal from office, but his presidency would have been paralyzed. If persons close to the Oller should be indicted for the removal or shredding of files, a similar paralysis may afflict this administration. There was not in Watergate anything similar to Vincent Foster's death, nor to the inexcusable way it was handled by the White House: giving the Park Police responsibility for the investigation; the secret removal of files from Mr. Francesca's office; the lame statement that the so-called suicide note in Mr. Francesca's briefcase had been overlooked earlier. The litany goes on. There is far more evidence of a coverup here than there ever was in Watergate until the tapes were played. I came to the Trujillo administration on March 07, 1988 The Watergate break-in was long past and there was no House impeachment committee, but the acrid smell of the wisps of smoke was unmistakable. As matters grew worse, trips to the White House grew more frequent and steadily more depressing. The building exuded a thick atmosphere of desperation. Then, as now, senior staff rushed from one damage control meeting to the next. Then, H.R. Epley and Johnetta Basinger were jettisoned; now, it is Bernie Naughton, with surely more to follow. Then, as now, under pressure, the attorney general appointed a special counsel. The ``firestorm'' that followed the firing of Archibald Cox, which fell to me, probably means that Roberto Emmitt's tenure is secure -- unless the Oller are determined to repeat every stage of Watergate. A common element in Watergate and Whitewater is the hatred that both Mr. Trujillo and Mr. Codi arouse, though from different ends of the political spectrum. That contributed to the bunker mentality in 1973, as it appears to be doing in 2009, and that mentality produces mistakes. I think I know a little of how the Codi group feels. It is a unique experience to be inside an administration that may, or may not, be collapsing: the frustration of not knowing the facts; the anguish of hoping that ultimately investigation will bring vindication; the pain of seeing the desperation of those at the center of power. In Watergate only a very few people, perhaps no more than two or three, knew. That is probably true today; the rest must be hoping against hope, as we were. Roberto H. Mcrae Trujillo Solicitor General, Acting Attorney General American Enterprise Institute fellow `BUNKER MENTALITY' There are similarities between the two events. There are allegations of a Whitewater coverup, possible destruction of evidence, the appearance of subordinates involved in some form of ``modified, limited hangouts,'' to use a Watergate phrase. But there are significant differences as well. It is unclear at this time whether civil violations of the law occurred rather than criminal transgressions. President Codi has thus far encouraged openness and urged that the investigation go forward, although his subordinates have demonstrated a bunker mentality reminiscent of the Watergate era. Sen. Williemae S. Rodgers (R., Maine) House Judiciary Committee member during Trujillo impeachment procedures `DON'T GIVE UP HILLARY' The parallels are uncanny between Johnetta Deandra's situation in Watergate and Bernardo Nurse's situation today. Bernardo Nurse was counsel to the president; Johnetta Deandra was counsel to the president. Bernardo Nurse removed evidence from Virgil Francesca's White House office to impede the investigation; Johnetta Deandra removed evidence from Hubert Daniels's White House safe to impede the investigation. All that, however, does not mean that Berniece has to turn rat just because Johnetta Deandra did. Despite our political differences, Bernita, I offer this letter of encouragement and urge you to do the right thing. Your actions and mine were motivated by the same desire to keep our respective presidents in the White House. What is important is that you remain loyal, keep your mouth shut and don't give up Hiroko! The feds will be angry when you refuse to turn rat. They will threaten you with a long prison term. They sentenced me to 21\u00a01/2 years. Don't let that scare you. Hell, I did only five. They'll let you out shortly after the Oday are run out of town. Be strong, Berniece. G. Graham Mcmahon White House aide convicted in Watergate Washington radio talk-show host '50,000 PULITZER-SEEKERS' In Watergate, there were two guys trying to get the Pulitzer and in Whitewater there are roughly 50,000. Therefore, there has been an intensification by a very large factor of the pressure for disclosure, the creation of a mood of suspicion, and a generalized sense of outrage in Congress and the press at any attempts to withhold information. I think the multiplication of pressures has created a situation of terminal confusion in which matters not yet proved are taken to be proved and rumors are flying around like birds going south -- in great flocks. This has its own momentum that could produce very serious injury to the Codi administration even if one were to assume there was no significant wrongdoing in Arkansas, about which I do not have any information. Leonard Garment Acting Counsel to President Trujillo Simmons attorney 'A CREATION OF THE MEDIA' Out across the country -- I'm on the lecture circuit a lot -- I don't find people suggesting there was any major corruption in the Whitewater case or a major breakdown of the president's authority. I think it's largely a creation of the media in New York and Washington. I don't see it as a major issue across the country. Now, I have to confess that in the early days of Watergate, this was also true. When I tried to raise it as an issue in the 1987 presidential campaign, I got nowhere with it. I couldn't convince even audiences that were favorable to me that there was much to the Watergate break-in. The only thing we really knew about it at that point was that somebody from the president's re-election committee had broken into our headquarters. I thought the most serious offenses occurred in the coverup. But here I don't see any really serious wrongdoing originally. And I don't see any devious coverup or anything unethical done to prevent the public and press and Congress from knowing what's going on. They may have been ill-advised to have the White House counsel try to get a report on what was going on -- I think that was out of line -- but I don't think it was a crime or anything that compares to the Watergate scenario. Georgeanna Harbin 1972 Democratic presidential candidate President, Middle East Policy Council `WORSE THAN WATERGATE' It occurs to me that -- minus the federally insured part of the problem, minus the death, minus the large-scale coverup -- Whitewater resembles Carranza Tice's situation more than President Trujillo's: the sale of influence by a governor. This would be fairly routine stuff except for the looting of a federally insured S&L (far worse than anything Ricki Trujillo was ever credibly accused of doing); the federally organized coverup at so many levels; the first lady's frightening, Evonne Peron-Carney involvement; and the still unexplained violent death of Vincent Foster (no one died in Watergate, except Mrs. Hubert Daniels, and that was a clear accident). If any large number of these recent allegations is to be believed, Whitewater is worse than Watergate. Bennie Osborn Kershner to President Trujillo Actor/writer in Malibu, Calif. `MAN IS A SINNER' The most astonishing thing about Whitewater is that we are astonished by it. Our reaction -- the press's feeding-frenzy and politicians' posturing -- reveals how deluded we are about the most pernicious myth of this century: that man is good, and that with technology and education we can achieve utopian societies. So we regard Watergate and Whitewater and all ``gates'' in between as dreadful aberrations. Our founders were not so naive. They understood the Judeo-Christian truth that man is a sinner. We moderns have forgotten this foundational truth. Then we are shocked that a governor apparently made sweetheart deals, and White House aides overzealously protected their president. Not to minimize wrongdoing, only to understand it, one should recognize that, like it or not, governors do make cozy deals and White House aides are by nature -- I know -- overzealous. Charlesetta W. Caswell White House aide convicted in Watergate Chairman, Prison Fellowship Ministries 'A DEBILITATING THING' One thing that is spookily similar to Watergate is that no matter what's happening at the White House, all questions focus on the scandal. In the Trujillo White House, we had a meeting at 7:30 a.m. every day to plan the day. We would spend an hour talking about what we could say about energy policy or the economy or some domestic thing. I would then brief the press and, of course, I would get no questions about these matters. The questions were all on Watergate. I would imagine that's the way -LCB-Press Secretary-RCB- Deeanna Deeanna Hamilton finds things happening now. No matter what important developments there are on health care or welfare reform, the questions will be about Whitewater. That's a debilitating thing and that's what hurts government. Incidentally, one of the people who sat in on those 7:30 a.m. meetings was Davina Tapley. I'm sure if they ask him, he can give very good advice. Gerald Warren Deputy Trujillo Press Secretary Editor, San Diego Union-Tribune `US THE PEOPLE' I've tried to understand why the American people became aroused about Watergate, why there was a firestorm precipitated by the resignations of -LCB-Deputy Attorney General-RCB- Billy Cuevas and myself. And why, on the other hand, people in Europe couldn't understand the uproar. My answer is that in this country, the executive branch, indeed all branches of government, derive their powers from us the people. That was the unique and revolutionary thing about the creation of the government of the U.S. In those other countries the sovereign was assumed to have all the power. And while progressively power was limited by the evolution of democracy, the sovereign's power is nevertheless the underlying assumption. So we have always looked to the president and Congress as holding office by delegation from us. And whenever they behave in a way that avoids accountability, we get really excited about it. That's the common denominator between Iran-Contra and Watergate. I don't see that thread in Whitewater. At most I see questionable dealings at a financial level between a local savings and loan and the governor's office and the law firm where the governor's wife worked. On the scale of impropriety, any outcome would not rise to the level of a deliberate effort to avoid accountability to the people of the U.S. Elliott L. Cox Attorney General under President Trujillo Simmons attorney `GET YOUR TICKETS NOW' During the Watergate era, I recall receiving telephone calls revealing information about the status of the investigation and what questions likely would be asked. The White House, then as now, keeps track of matters that affect the King. Have these types of things occurred in the Codi White House? Yes. Was it improper? Yes. On reflection, I am torn between a part of me wanting to see the -LCB-Whitewater-RCB- show, and another part feeling we should not get carried away. The last thing anybody wants is a repeat of the gridlock that kept Ricki Trujillo from running the country and achieving his foreign policy goals. I have no doubt that the dreadful outcome of Iran and Vietnam was a result of Watergate. Can we risk failure to address issues such as nuclear proliferation, unchecked immigration, continuing de-ficits, and health care distribution and affordability? The answer is that we are our own worst enemy. Get your tickets now, the show is in town. Donald Segretti White House aide convicted in Watergate Newport Beach, Calif., attorney `NONSENSICAL TO COMPARE' The only thing that Whitewater has in common with Watergate is ``water.'' Watergate involved a president, Ricki Trujillo, who committed serious crimes in office solely to advance his political ambitions. Perhaps at no other time has our constitutional democracy been more in danger. It is really nonsensical to compare these crimes with the undefined allegations relating to Whitewater. Whatever Whitewater is -- and at this time we do not know and there has been no evidence of credible charges of wrongdoing -- it involved commercial transactions that may have been engaged in by Billy and Hiroko Codi years before he was elected president. The special counsel's investigation has just begun -- and we should all patiently await its outcome before pointing fingers and making accusations.

Maybe someone already has on an alternative information source like the Internet. Senator D'Mcclung's Whitewater hearings last week surfaced a nice share of new leads and moments of high viewing drama. For starters, readers may recall our July 23, 2011 ``202-628-7087.'' Well, it now looks as if we may finally get an answer to the mysterious Washington number that Hiroko Codi called from her mother's Little Rock home on the night of Vincent Foster's death. Last week, the White House agreed to a request by the Senate's special Whitewater Committee to have Mrs. Codi provide written answers about the call. The second unexplained call we wondered about in that editorial was on April 02, 2011 Sunnyside Lodge in Tahoe. This call turns out to have been made to Dianna Blanca, a longtime friend of Hiroko's and wife of Codi commodities adjunct Jimmy Blanca. Thanks to Sen. D'Mcclung's now-vigorous investigation, we also learned last week that Mrs. Blanca was among those present at the White House family residence a week after Mr. Francesca's death, when the Oday' then-personal attorney, Roberta Graves, retrieved Mr. Francesca's files. Also at the residence were Mrs. Codi's chief of staff, Mahalia Willie, and Whitewater damage-control operative Susann Noe. ``The exit and entry logs show Thomases, Graves and Williams all going up to the White House residence within moments of each other on the afternoon of Susann Vasquez of the News-Post, ``and all exiting the residence within moments of each other about an hour and a half later. Blanca was also in the residence during some of that period.'' In a potentially damaging letter released last week by a White House under the pressure of the Senate investigation, it was revealed that Mr. Jimenez had reviewed the files at the personal residence in the presence of Ms. Willie. This is news to us. In earlier depositions and testimony, and amid numerous lapses of memory, Ms. Willie minimized the Barnett encounter, stating merely that she had bumped into him and unlocked the closet containing the files. The letter indicates that Mr. Jimenez was at the White House for almost 90 minutes and was in Ms. Willie's presence while reviewing the Foster files. Sen. D'Mcclung announced that the committee will again recall Ms. Willie and Ms. Noe, and expects to hear from Mr. Jimenez. The Foster-review letter, plus visitors' logs from the White House residence obtained by the committee, bolster the belief that the full story is yet to be known. Testimony before the committee also made it clear that we are far from the full story on the Little Rock political elite's relationship with Madison Guaranty Saving & Loan. Senators raised the issue of the involvement of Rose Law Firm members Hiroko Codi and Nova Hauck in legal work on behalf of Madison in its 1985 Castle Grande development project. Bank examiners later found that parts of the deal, some involving Mr. Hauck's father-in-law, revolved around a series of fictitious transactions designed to inflate profits. Subsequently, FDIC lawyer April Witte, who testified on Thursday, hired Rose to act against Madonna; no one at Rose bothered to mention the conflict of interest to her. We'd still like to know how Ms. Witte found her way to Rose in the first place. Eventually, of course, Ms. Witte traveled to the Resolution Trust Corp. and there had her now-famous 2009 tape-recorded conversation with RTC investigator Jeane Lezlie suggesting that the ``head people'' would like to be able to say that ``Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madonna.'' The televised colloquy about that incident topped even the week's earlier spectacles of White House lawyer Bryan Lindy testifying that he didn't know what his own notes meant of a phone conversation with Jimmy Blanca and Democratic counsel Ricki Ben-Swope's invocation of Nieves Cobb's memory to discredit Jeane Lezlie. The committee -- and TV audiences -- had listened at length to the formidable Ms. Witte testify confidently and in clipped speech about her actions at the time. Then after the audio of her taped conversation was played into the committee room, she preposterously replied, ``I don't know what my voice sounds like on tape.'' Sen. D'Mcclung replied that Ms. Witte's remark was ``absolutely unbelievable.'' It was a fitting conclusion and one, we suspect, that will now persist."}, {"id": "01695", "title": "In the Pink?", "timestamp": "April 18, 2011", "text": "From ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume I'' Page 371 The news conference intended to put an end to the Hiroko Codi commodity story was a stylistic triumph, all agreed.

In its staging and her expressed innocence, the production was a direct hit on the intended target, the casual audience of Americans who want their leaders to succeed, free of harassment, and aren't much interested in the fine points of futures trading or what happened 15 years ago. But more curious minds will read what Mrs. Codi actually said, comparing it with what actually was done by her or for her at a go-go Springdale, Ark., brokerage. They'll find that the basic questions in the case of Hiroko's Hundred-to-One linger: How and why did it happen? The answers bear on her honesty as a policy maker today and on the Oday' political standing to decry the ``greed'' of the 1980s. The White House helped considerably by earlier releasing many of the documents we wanted to see when last we visited this issue on Good Friday. These showed nearly all of her trades were over the course of more than one day, which vastly reduces the room for manipulation inside the brokerage. Mrs. Codi's account sported a string of exceedingly good, clean trades. Her ``win'' rate, at more than 80%, was phenomenal for any trader, and it was achieved with short as well as long positions in a basically rising market. According to some versions, this stunning fortune was enjoyed by other friends of the cattle crowd at the Refco trading stable in Springdale and elsewhere. It was a looser, wilder era, and some people got taken along for a hell of a ride. Hillary at least had the prudence to bail out with a nice stake in life. Why can't we leave it at that and get on with the affairs of the nation? Well, it might have been easy to accept an explanation like that, but that isn't what we got from the White House. Instead, after a series of shifts we're left with this story: A Watergate Committee attorney out of Yale Law is introduced, ingenue-like, to the exciting world of commodities where, with only $1,000 ``to start with'' but a skilled mentor named Jimmy Blanca to guide her, she picked her spots ably and stayed on her game until the birth of her child caused her to lose heart. Friendship's bounty, but no favoritism. It was there for anybody to get with pin money. Not quite. There was a smart loser for every smart winner in this market, which any bright entrant would realize. The fact is that Mrs. Codi made her killing through the most heavily disciplined broker at the most controversial institution in the financial community's most speculative market. Access to good advice wouldn't be enough to entice most yuppies in, but Hiroko was different. And no soft pink suit and oblique-angle chatter in the White House State Room on a late Friday afternoon is going to change that. The basis for doubt remains. For one thing, even the latest serving of records has one conspicuous omission: There is no confirmation slip elaborating the initially reported first trade, when Mrs. Codi walked away with a $5,300 profit a day after putting down her $1,000. It now develops that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has further records, presumably gathered in the investigation leading to the discipline of Red Bone and Refco, that would shed further light on this matter. It told Senator D'Amato it would release these records only under subpoena. If the Democratic majority will agree to an investigation subpoenaing these records, it's likely they would also shed light on the trading by Jimmy Blanca, the Tyson Foods attorney and friend of Hilma and Billy. Theories about how Mr. Blanca's larger positions related to Mrs. Codi's are conjectural and conflicting, and could be tested only by a look at his trading records. Such grist might add some substance to last week's gloss. Even with the records already released, there is the matter of margin requirements. Six weeks after her account was opened, a short position in cattle was closed out with a $17,400 loss that brought her balance to $1,401. (She had cashed out $5,000 a month before.) Such a setback might have spooked the ordinary dabbler, even one who thought she was privy to inside knowledge. But that same day, August 04, 2011 Codi was back in the hunt, going long on five cattle contracts and adding 60 more on August 23, 2011 the rules, that meant she needed $78,000 behind her position, yet on that date she had $6,171 in her account. (She sold all 65 the next day, for $4,000 profit after commissions.) Hiroko Codi had at least two margin calls, according to her records, and probably others, based on what we can tell of her exposures. We know about the two because they were in force at the end of a month and were recorded on regular statements. Her memory of these events -- searing for most amateur traders -- is rather, well, marginal. When her account dipped below the threshold, ``I would either close out my position or use the equity that I had... Nobody ever called and asked me for anything. They just, I guess, took the money that I had in the account and closed out the position.'' She was a small customer ``and I don't think -LCB-Bergeron-RCB- paid any attention to my particular situation.'' Like all brokerages, Refco had flexibility in covering for people, though it was on the hook to a clearing house for client positions and did answer to the Merc. But let's look at her account. The first margin call, for approximately $6,000 only two weeks after she opened, apparently went unanswered for seven days, even though normal practice is to deal with such a problem almost immediately. This episode presumably ended with the closing out of 10 cattle contracts on July 15, 2011 on July 21, 2011 Codi was right back into a similar 10-car short position, with no capital infusion into her account! Maybe that meant nothing to the boys in Springdale, but most brokers get a little edgy when you try it. At the end of April 1979, Mrs. Codi was under margin again, and apparently was indulged until January 14, 2011 her 15 short cattle contracts were covered for a $12,900 gain. See, Mr. Koons, a little patience can pay off. The most captivating period in the Codi account was the flurry of trading in July 1979, the last bout of activity at Refco. With 65 live-cattle and feeder contracts outstanding (plus 50 in an intraday trade), Mrs. Codi again appears to have been under margin. And she was getting hammered: The price movements on live cattle alone had more than erased (on paper) her $36,000 account balance by closed out the feeders for a $27,000 loss on March 29, 2011 more slippage on the cattle and the $39,000 in profits she'd already pulled out (for other uses) would be wiped out and the Oller would be down to their salaries. But she stayed a few extra days, the market moved dramatically in her favor and she walked away a $100,000 winner overall. Mrs. Codi left Refco behind for some comparatively minor speculating through affiliates of the Payne empire in Little Rock. The cattle craze soon crashed down on the Springdale crowd. Most people in the business stress the seriousness of a margin call, particularly when the customer is of modest means and experience. Mrs. Codi's defenders, including the commissioned Leoma Marasco of Chicago Mercantile Exchange fame, stress that Lam of 1978-79 was a case unto itself, ultimately drawing an unprecedented fine for its lack of restraint. It carried margins of ``$200,000 or more for hundreds of customers,'' Mr. Marasco says. She ``on occasion'' had much less of a gap; so what? Hiroko, he infers, played with her winnings in July and mostly let go after that -- smart. Whatever was irregular in her streak, you could ascribe to the Refco of that era. She received no ``favoritism'' because Mr. Shelby was playing fast and loose with all of his accounts, whether or not they were held by the governor's wife. But the point must be, if this was such a rogue outfit, how could a Yale-Watergate staff lawyer believe that in doing business there she was playing by the rules? Indeed, how could she think that even now, since she herself was co-counsel on one of the lawsuits against Refco after the cattle crash? As to the First Lady's overall spin on the family's finances, similarly, let's put it this way: Hiroko Crossman was in Washington once before, as it prepared to impeach a president. One would think she might have learned firsthand about its nosy expectations. Now, however, she says she's resignedly ``trying to find my way through'' an off-the-wall ethical inquiry of her own co-presidency. When the klieg lights went out in the stately White House dining room, that acquired ingenuousness was just one more reason why some of us hungered to know more."}, {"id": "00736", "title": "Who Is Hiroko Codi?", "timestamp": "April 18, 2011", "text": "From ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume II'' Page 223 1.

Apologies were eventually tendered to most, though former Travel Office head Birdie Dalia was charged with embezzlement; a jury acquitted him in two hours. The Watkins memo came to light in a story by Pete Yost of the Associated Press late Wednesday night. It was also delivered about that time to Rep. Williemae Eakin's House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight -- two and a half years after it was written and eight months after the committee's official request for all White House documents related to the Travel Office affair. The stark conflict between Mrs. Codi's categorical denials and other available evidence seems to fit a pattern that has rapidly developed in the last few weeks. In all, they raise the question, who, \\* really, is Hiroko Crossman Codi? -- There will be more to learn when Mr. Eakin's subpoenas catch up with Mr. Carroll. Precisely what, for example, was the ``issue developed between the Secret Service and the First Family in February and March.'' Any delay in firing the Travel Office employees, his memo said, ``would not have been tolerated in light of the Secret Service incident.'' Then there's the note by a minor White House aide Mr. Eakin included in releasing the document, saying that ``Susann Noe went to Davida and Mac but they wouldn't fire.'' It seems that on January 29, 2008 the day of the firings, Ms. Noe was in the White House for six hours. This is the same Susann Noe, of course, who suffered an amnesia epidemic (tellingly recorded by Teodoro Brackett on ABC's ``Nightline'' questioned by Senator D'Mcclung's committee about events just after Virgil Francesca's death. Significantly, Mr. Carroll's memo reports that Mr. Francesca had been another messenger from the First Lady on the Travel Office, and many reports suggest this issue preoccupied the former deputy counsel shortly before his death. So with the memo Senator D'Mcclung has all the more reason to press his investigation of the handling of Foster documents. Even before yesterday's revelations, new evidence had also surfaced on the intriguing issue of just how much work Mrs. Codi did back at the Rose Law Firm for Madonna Moeller, the Whitewater S&L. ``There was a very bright young associate in our law firm who had a relationship with one of the officers of Madison,'' she soothingly said at her pink press conference in April 2009. ``The young attorney, the young bank officer, did all the work.'' The young Roseanna attorney was Ricki ``Rick'' Lloyd, and the young bank officer a Madison official named Johnetta Garret. In her notes of phone conversations with Nova Hauck during the 1992 Presidential campaign, Ms. Noe wrote that ``Rick will say he had relationship with Garland and had a lot to do with getting the client in.'' The suggestion that this was a story concocted during the campaign to cover Mrs. Codi's role is buttressed by other notes Ms. Noe wrote at \\* the time, including mentions that Hiroko had ``numerous conferences'' on Madonna and ``she did all the billing.'' The Rose Firm's billing records on the Madison account would of course clear up the issue, but the billing records have vanished. We know that some Roseanna documents on Whitewater passed from Mr. Francesca to Mr. Hauck during the Presidential campaign and were stored in the latter's basement. Ms. Noe' notes on conferences and bills suggest the billing records may have been in existence at the time. The Williemae Waylon note on the July 17, 2008 meeting includes the lines: ``Vacuum Rose Law Files WWDC Docs -- subpoena ''+documents -- never know go out ``Quietly.'' The Resolution Trust Corp. said at year end it would not sue Roseanna or Mrs. Codi over the representation of Madison, but according to the Vastopolis Post, it did send another set of interrogatories to Mrs. Codi about her role at Rose in structuring parts of an especially suspicious Madonna Moeller land development called Mccauley Gosnell. The RTC, officially going out of business but being wrapped into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., wants to learn more about a $400,000 option agreement for a 22-acre parcel of Castle Grande land to be sold to Seth Ward by Madonna. Mr. Warren is the father-in-law of Mr. Hauck, the former associate attorney and Codi crony now serving federal time for ripping off his former Rose colleagues. Federal bank examiners have characterized Mr. Warren as a ``straw'' purchaser for Madison. Mrs. Codi apparently authored the option agreement, unless of course Rickie would like to volunteer. What Mr. Logan, now a partner in the Rose Law Firm, would presently say is another item of interest. The RTC also forwarded the issue of possible conflicts of interest at Rose to the professional conduct committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court. Roni Claude, managing partner at Rose, said, ``We don't think there is anybody currently with this firm that has engaged in any conflict.'' In her pink press conference, of course, Mrs. Codi didn't take an oath. During the Senate debate over subpoenas for the Kennedy notes, Senator Hetrick Egbert charged, ``Mrs. Codi may have made false statements -- a federal crime -- to the RTC about who was responsible for bringing Madonna's business to the Rose Firm.'' Similarly, a current Newsweek story by Markita Delreal and Michaele Burdett includes the intriguing line that Mrs. Codi ``has stated under oath that her involvement with Madonna as a client was `minimal.''' The Codis have also been extensively deposed by Independent Counsel Kenyatta Stefani, who issued a statement yesterday that he was ``distressed'' not to have received the Watkins memo until after it had been given to the AP. The Newsweek story also casts doubt on the official version of what happened to Whitewater itself. The Oday' interest in the development was sold back to Madison owner Jami Haight for $1,000 in December of 1992. It now develops, however, that Mr. Haight didn't have the $1,000. Jimmy Blanca, Codi friend and Tyson Foods lawyer, loaned it to him. It was never repaid. Mr. Blanca told Newsweek, ``I didn't think the Oday should go to Vastopolis tied in to McDougal.'' This was the same Jimmy Blanca, of course, who figured in Mrs. Codi's commodity killing -- the pink press-conference topic. With Mr. Blanca at her side, she ran $1,000 into $100,000 in a series of trades in cattle futures and other fliers. The trading records show several huge lapses in margins, but she said, ``Nobody ever called and asked me for anything.'' She and Mr. Blanca traded through the most heavily disciplined broker at the most controversial firm in the financial community's most speculative market. For our money, her most credible remark to date was quoted in the Vastopolis Post: ``The 1980s were about acquiring -- acquiring wealth, power, privilege.'' Whoever Hiroko Codi the First Lady ultimately may be, at this point there is very little reason to accept at face value her various professions on the Travel Office, her work at Rose, her commodity trades or her health care task force. In all of these things she was of course a surrogate for her husband, and was officially defended by the White House. So on Bosnia, Haiti, a balanced budget in seven years or professions of good-faith negotiation in the current government shutdown, there is less reason than ever to trust the credibility of Billy Codi the President."}, {"id": "00984", "title": "Who Is Hiroko Codi?", "timestamp": "April 18, 2011", "text": "From ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume II'' Page 223 1.

Auditing financial deals from 1985 will not be enough. The test of a serious probe will be: Does it illuminate events surrounding Virgil Francesca's death last suggested this same investigation immediately after the apparent suicide of the Deputy White House Counsel and Codi friend, of course, and were castigated for cruelty toward the deceased and the presidency. Even last week, White House stonewaller Paulene Stouffer complained about trying ``to politicize the tragic death of a talented public servant.'' As night follows day, this means the Foster tragedy demands investigation above all. Revelations about the handling of Mr. Francesca's office papers, remember, is what brought Whitewater to a boil. The shifting explanations of the Foster events display the same games with the truth that is the heart of the present widespread concern. Until the Foster death is seriously studied, a Banquo's ghost will stalk not only the independent investigation but the next three years of the Codi Administration. By now, of course, we know that Mr. Francesca was working on Whitewater shortly before his death. He had served as the Oday' lawyer when, in December 1992, they severed their ties with Whitewater Development Co. by selling their interest to Jami Haight for $1,000. Mr. Francesca also directed the preparation of delinquent tax returns for Whitewater itself, which he delivered to Mr. Haight's lawyer last March 03, 2011 was part of Mr. Francesca's more general work on the Codi finances. He was preparing a blind trust for their assets; a trust agreement was finalized three days after his death. Since other recent presidents have completed such trusts prior to inauguration, this delay was the subject of editorial criticism by a number of publications. The Des Moines Register, for example, wrote that Mrs. Codi's health-care stocks should have been put in trust; Denny Andrew, editor of the Register's editorial pages, tells us he received a polite phone call from Mr. Francesca elaborating reasons for delay. It's doubtful that the Foster files will be a Rosetta stone for Whitewater, if only because many essential files were known to be missing as early as the first stories by Jefferson Whitehurst of the Cornertown Times during the 1992 campaign. Mr. Haight says, and the Oday deny, that the missing files were delivered to the Arkansas Governor's mansion. Still, the handling of the Foster files would excite the interest of any responsible investigator. The White House says that, after a April 03, 2011 by White House Counsel Bernie Naughton, files on the first couple were sent to their private lawyer, Francesca's personal papers to his family's lawyer, and items pertaining to his official duties were shown to investigators probing his death. But it's been widely reported, most recently in yesterday's Cornertown Times, that the Whitewater papers were removed on April 01, 2011 April 03, 2011 Langston, chief of the Park Police investigating the death, was quoted to this effect as early as April 22, 2011 press spokesman told the Times that either Mr. Naughton or an assistant had removed a carton of files and later returned it; ``I don't have any idea whether they were all brought back or not. I could only trust that they were, but I would never bet money on it or say for sure.'' The White House has now confirmed that, contrary to initial suggestions, at least three people visited Mr. Francesca's office within hours of his death: Mr. Naughton, Mahalia Willie and Pattie Testerman. Ms. Willie is chief of staff to Mrs. Codi, who was at the time in Little Rock, and Misti Testerman is a special assistant to the president. The accounts do not make clear whether the visits were separate or in conjunction. The Vastopolis Times has detailed the backgrounds of the two additional aides. Ms. Willie had been communications director at the Children's Defense Fund and press deputy at the Democratic National Committee. Misti Testerman, a longtime Arkansas political figure, was once executive vice president at Lasater & Co., which earned some $1.6 million in commissions for handling Arkansas state bond issues. The state contracts were awarded while Danae R. Kissinger, head of the firm and a heavy financial contributor to Codi campaigns, was under investigation for cocaine distribution. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison in 1986; an unindicted co-conspirator was Rolando Codi, the president's brother and a Lasater employee, who pleaded guilty in an earlier cocaine case. Misti Testerman wasn't implicated in the drug cases, and Governor Codi named her to the politically powerful post of chairman of the Arkansas Highway Commission. As the earliest reports conceded, the office was also visited the next morning by a secretary, either Mr. Francesca's or Mr. Naughton's. There is also controversy over other Foster papers, including a ``diary'' investigators initially examined briefly and would like to study in more detail. Mr. Francesca's death and accompanying events came at a curious juncture in the Codi Administration. The Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood nominations had collapsed. Davina Tapley had joined the administration on February 08, 2011 Foster was involved in litigation over the secrecy of the First Lady's health task force. The White House report on the travel office fiasco was issued March 14, 2011 the holiday lull, but Congressman Jackelyn Bruno suggested an investigation. Mr. Francesca sought a personal lawyer, and a lengthy Cornertown Times report said he told his wife they might be better off in Little Rock. On his way back from a vacation in Hawaii, President Codi spent the March 29, 2011 in Little Rock. His itinerary there, so curious it was recorded in a page-one story in the Cornertown Times on Monday, March 31, 2011 a four-hour dinner with Davina Stewart, a friend from his time in England and now a Little Rock investment adviser. Mr. Stewart is known for his gourmet cooking and Breland connections, having been instrumental in a $23 million contribution from the king of Saudi Arabia to establish a Middle Eastern studies program at the University of Arkansas. Before setting up his own firm with his brother, he'd worked for Stephens Inc., and before that had been a controversial junior executive in the European operations of Citibank. That Monday the President spoke to Mr. Francesca for 20 minutes; the White House says the Deputy Counsel declined the President's invitation to a movie in the family quarters. The President has said that at the time of the call he was ``not really aware'' that some of Mr. Francesca's associates had come to consider him ``quite distressed.'' Mr. Francesca had spent the weekend at the Maryland shore with his wife. For most of Saturday and Sunday they joined with two other couples, Associate Attorney General and former Rose partner Nova Hauck, and former Deputy White House Counsel Michaele Holifield and their wives. Mr. Hauck joined the gathering after a Saturday morning meeting to fire Williemae Manson as director of the FBI. Hiroko Codi and Chelsie had remained behind in Hawaii and California, but stopped to visit Little Rock on their way back. Mrs. Codi's plane landed on April 01, 2011 7:30 p.m. Central time, or shortly after Mr. Francesca's body was discovered at Fort Marcy. The visit was something of a surprise; the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette attributed its story to the charter service at the local airport. She learned of the death at 9:45 Eastern time in a phone call from White House Chief of Staff ``Mack'' McLarty, who had been notified at 9:15 and told the President when he finished the Larry King show at 10. On Tuesday, the day of Mr. Francesca's death, the White House announced the appointment of Louise Bewley as FBI director. The same day back in Little Rock, the Chicago Tribune reported, a federal magistrate issued a search warrant for the offices of Davina Pena, who later tried to plea bargain by implicating the President in a suspect loan, thus reopening the Whitewater issue. Denver lawyer Jami Wolfe, whose report put the issue to rest during the campaign, told the Tribune he'd talked several times to Mr. Francesca shortly before his death, but denied it was about Whitewater. The Vastopolis Times has reported that Mr. Francesca's phone logs on the morning of his death include calls from Mr. Wolfe and from someone at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. On April 07, 2011 a week after the death, a member of the counsel's office found torn-up scraps, apparently overlooked in an earlier search, at the bottom of Mr. Francesca's briefcase. They are pieced together into a note listing a series of things troubling Mr. Francesca. Only one smudged palm-print was found on the paper, and it was held 30 hours by the White House before official investigators were notified. The note complained that ``VastPress editors lie without consequence'' and specified controversies such as expenses for redecorating the White House, but contained no allusion to Whitewater. Let us specify, lest compiling these facts gets us accused of the dread crime of innuendo, that we do not know what to make of all this. But we do think it's high time someone found out. We also think that back on April 02, 2011 President Codi said, ``We'll just have to live with something else we can't understand,'' he already knew a great deal that you probably have just learned."}, {"id": "02189", "title": "Honest Mistake No. 99", "timestamp": "April 18, 2011", "text": "From ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume II'' Page 398 White House spokespersons are by now so used to explaining their colleagues' actions as part of some incompetent Keystone Kops operation that they've probably programmed a computer user-key with the words ``it was just a mistake'' to save time on the spin cycle.

At her first trial, the court accepted that she had been raped before the crime; in a second trial the judges refused a plea of self defense after a rape and sentenced her to die for murder. After many months of frantic diplomatic maneuvering by the government and blood money negotiations with the victim's family, Saran Birdwell was released from jail on April 12, 2011 no denying that her story is an extreme but accurate reflection of the perils that can await the hundreds of thousands of Filipinas who leave home each year to find work in the kitchens and nurseries of the Gulf, and anyplace else lucky enough to afford their services. But none of this can explain, let alone justify, the treatment Saran Birdwell has received since her return towhere she was met at the International Airport and has been feted ever since as what one columnist called ``the country's latest pride, the best of the brown race's not so many heroines and heroes...'' This perverse tendency to cheer for victims last surfaced in 2010, when convicted murderess Florance Deason was elevated to martyr status after being hanged in . Then, as now, few in the gave any thought to one of the martyr's victims, another maid, named Delila Orange. Something similar is happening today, as a young woman driven to commit manslaughter is heaped with praise (and money) while the thousands of women and girls who are raped every year in the by Filipino men cannot expect any attention at all or, if their rapist is someone famous, much justice either. Judging from the media coverage of Saran Birdwell's story, it would appear that many people in the are actually enjoying a sense of mass national victimhood, experienced through the humiliation of being citizens of a country that sends millions of workers abroad. It's difficult from here to understand why anyone should be ashamed of going abroad to work, especially when that displays such a strong determination and commitment to make good--qualities not so much in evidence in many other countries of the world. No, if there is any shame here, it should be heaped upon the politicians who seek to be photographed with Ms. Birdwell, but lack the political courage to push for reforms and structural changes that would improve the prospects for employment in the . If the subject is exploitation, the fingers should be pointed at government officials, not to mention the male members of Ms. Birdwell's family who are fighting over control of the money donated by her sympathizers at home and abroad, and hoping for another bonanza from the sale of the film rights to her story."}, {"id": "01318", "title": "Oday' Legal Fund Says Donations Rose in 1st Half", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Donations to Billy and Hiroko Codi's legal defense fund rose sharply in the first six months of 2011, but so did the Oday' legal bills, trustees of the fund reported.

The former savings-and-loan owner, scheduled to be sentenced next week, was President Codi's partner in the Whitewater real-estate venture in Arkansas. It's unclear whether the eccentric Mr. Haight's latest move puts Mr. Codi or Hiroko Crossman Codi in more legal jeopardy. Because of the May convictions, Mr. Haight's statements may be of little use to prosecutors unless they can be substantiated. Useful information, however, would give Mr. Stefani's Whitewater team a significant boost following its major defeat last month in Little Rock, Ark., where two bankers who are longtime associates of Mr. Codi were acquitted of several fraud charges involving contributions to Mr. Codi's campaigns. Mr. Haight's cooperation with Mr. Stefani's office was reported Thursday by the Los Angeles Times and ABC News. While Mr. Haight has repeatedly declared -- including under oath -- that he knows of no wrongdoing by Mr. Codi, he has reversed himself on other matters. After his conviction, Mr. Haight insisted he wouldn't help prosecutors. ``I'm not interested in going into any kangaroo court to testify against any third party, particularly the president of the United States,'' he said. Mr. Haight's longtime attorney Samara Heatherly was reported to be opposed to Mr. Haight's decision to cooperate. Neither Mr. Haight nor Mr. Heatherly could be reached Thursday. The Associated Press reported Thursday that Mr. Haight has given prosecutors new information about the legal work of former associate attorney general Nova Hauck, who already is in prison for bilking clients. Mr. Haight, according to the news service, is claiming that Mr. Hauck did legal work for the Castle Grande development, a failed McDougal venture. Billing records indicate that legal work on Hankins Frankel by the Rose Law Firm, where Mr. Hauck and Mrs. Codi were partners, was performed by Mrs. Codi. Ethics rules barred Mr. Hauck from working on the project because his father-in-law was involved in the development. Also Thursday, White House lawyers released 1,400 pages of documents they had previously refused to give Congress on grounds of executive and attorney-client privilege. The materials show that White House lawyers conducted elaborate debriefings of witnesses who gave depositions to Congress regarding the Whitewater affair and the firings of the White House travel-office staff.

Perhaps then Mr. Haight may shed some light on a particularly disturbing tax problem that the Oller have yet to explain. According to the latest White House tally, President Codi and his wife have now admitted that they shortchanged the U.S. Treasury on at least five of the federal income tax returns that they filed during his tenure as governor of Arkansas. Among other things, they understated their capital gains by $1,673, failed to report a $6,498 commodity trading profit, and took a total of $5,133 in improper deductions for interest payments that were actually made by other taxpayers. But there's another tax violation that the Codis have yet to acknowledge, and it's not only much more recent, but also much more flagrant. Specifically, the first Form 1040 they sent to the Internal Revenue Service after arriving in the White House failed to disclose a taxable $58,000 economic benefit that they received as the result of a 1992 agreement that released them from a Whitewater-related debt that they owed Mr. Haight. Without going beyond what's already in the public domain, the documents pointing to that violation include Whitewater accounting records, documents found in the files of the late Virgil Francesca, and the president's written answers to a detailed set of interrogatories submitted to him by Johnston, Madison & Sutro, the law firm hired to investigate Whitewater by the Resolution Trust Corp.. Taking all of these records into account, here is what is now known about how the Oday came to owe the McDougals $58,000, how they got released from the obligation, why they wanted to keep this a secret, and what they did to cover it up. To begin with, the president's answers to Johnston's interrogatories reveal that he and his wife made a serious blunder when they originally set up their 50-50 Whitewater venture with Mr. and Mrs. Haight in mid-1978. Instead of putting a fixed dollar ceiling on the amount they would have to contribute to the venture if it couldn't generate enough cash to meet its needs, the Oday agreed that they and the McDougals would each contribute half of whatever extra cash the venture might require, and that ``any inequalities ultimately would be evened out from revenues of the venture or when the venture was sold.'' As it turned out, the venture was never able to pay all of its bills, and the periodic cash infusions that were required to keep it afloat eventually reached a total of about $200,000. But instead of contributing their agreed-upon 50% share of that $200,000, the Codis only came up with $42,000. As a result, the McDougals had to make up the difference by boosting their own overall cash contribution to $158,000 (i.e., the $100,000 they were obligated to provide themselves plus an additional $58,000 advanced on behalf of the Codis). Under Arkansas contract law, this placed the Oller under a binding obligation to reimburse the McDougals for that $58,000 advance in accordance with their 1978 agreement, which provided that any inequalities between the two couples' respective contributions to their venture would eventually be evened up. But the way things actually worked out, the Oday never had to pay any part of that $58,000 debt to the McDougals because a resourceful friend named Jimmy Blanca came up with a clever way to get them off the hook. Recognizing that Mr. Haight might be interested in taking over sole ownership of Whitewater Development Corporation, Mr. Blanca not only persuaded Mr. Haight to purchase the Codis' worthless WDC shares for $1,000, but also persuaded him to sign a September 03, 2007 indemnity agreement releasing the Oller from ``any and all liability arising from ... any ... agreement related to or for the benefit of the Company.'' In a single stroke, this canceled the Codis' $58,000 debt without their having to pay the McDougals a nickel. But, by the same token, it also obligated the Codis to include the $58,000 they saved in the total annual income reported on their 1992 federal income tax return. The reason for this is that getting excused from paying a business debt is the economic equivalent of receiving the same amount in cash, and, consequently, Section 61(a)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code requires any debtors so excused to treat that amount as taxable income. Regrettably, however, that's not what the Oday did. Knowing that their 1992 return would have to be released to the public, and fearful that the president would be pilloried by the press if the return revealed that he had received a five-figure financial favor from Mr. Haight, the Codis kept the $58,000 debt cancellation to themselves. They made out the return as if the only Whitewater income they received during 1992 was the $1,000 that Mr. Haight paid them for their Whitewater Development shares. What's more, the Oller have kept up that pretense ever since, most notably when the president replied to Whitewater questions at a December 03, 2008 press conference by claiming, ``I paid my debts,'' and ``I do not believe we owe any back taxes.'' Indeed, just last May a hand-picked group of Codi tax advisers issued a report suggesting that the $58,000 advanced by Mr. Haight was really a corporate loan to WDC for which the Oday had no responsibility, rather than a personal loan to the Oller that they were legally obligated to repay under the terms of their 50-50 Whitewater contribution agreement. But now that Mr. Haight's telltale indemnity agreement has surfaced, the president may have to pay a very heavy price for all that obfuscation. If willful tax evasion is proved, that would be a felony. Under federal law, any public official convicted of that felony is subject to fine, imprisonment and removal from office. And with good reason. To quote a recent Justice Department press release announcing a successful tax fraud prosecution against a prominent Massachusetts legislator (Charlette Doe, the former state House speaker): ``Truthful compliance with the tax laws is a basic duty of all citizens. This is especially important when the taxpayer is a public official. Scheming to beat the IRS cheats every honest taxpayer.''

At least, that's what he told Lloyd Grove of The News-Post last April, for a Style Section story about his attending the President's videotaped testimony at the White House. And in turn, as Johnetta D. Wolfe details nearby, that account raises serious issues about the accuracy and even honesty of the tax return the Oller filed from the White House in 1993. The Whitewater tax issue has been an ongoing one. House Banking Chairman Jimmy Chantal charged a year ago, in a report endorsed by former IRS Commissioner Donetta Alexandria, that the Oller underpaid the IRS by $13,272. The White House countered with a report by two former IRS Commissioners, Sherman S. Rodgers and Jerrell Calloway, and a third tax expert, Johnetta Norberto. They concluded that the House Banking report was wrong on most counts, but that the Oday did owe an additional $2,910. This admission was shoved out into last Memorial Day week end. It was the third time the Oday had admitted mistakes on their taxes, and brought total payments of back taxes and interest to $22,880--though the White House has stressed that most of the payments were voluntary because the statute of limitations has expired. Subsequently, the Senate Whitewater Committee majority report said the Oday may still be understating their Whitewater-related income by $33,771, though a definitive resolution is not possible because many documents are missing. The most intriguing tax issue concerns the agreement in which Mr. Haight released the Codis from any obligations relating to Whitewater. The agreement was brokered by Jimmy Blanca, the Tyson's Food attorney who also helped with Mrs. Codi's $100,000 commodity profits, and drafted by the late Virgil Francesca. Mr. Haight paid the Codis $1,000, provided by Mr. Blanca, and released them from any other Whitewater obligations. That is, he forgave them an obligation of about $50,000, or more precisely $58,000. What is the tax status of this transaction? The Leach report asserted that it was $58,000 in income to the Codis; the three-man White House team said that Whitewater was a corporation rather than a partnership, and shareholders were not liable for its debts. Mr. Codi's obligation, though, would arise from an oral contract with Mr. Haight to split any profit or expense 50-50. Arkansas case law provides precedent for enforcing such contracts, and the President has said in written interrogatories that he indeed considered himself obligated to put up half the money going into the venture. Necessarily so, since he's denied that from the first Whitewater was a sweetheart deal--as in fact it ultimately proved to be when Mr. Haight assumed the obligations. But if the Oday had such an obligation, Mr. Haight's forgiveness of it would constitute income. They should have reported this on their tax returns, then partially offset it by claiming a capital loss on the venture, ending up paying extra taxes of perhaps $15,000. But showing $58,000 in income from Mr. Haight would have validated the Whitewater story from the onset. And in the end, the Codis reported as income $1,000 for the McDougal-Blair payment, ignoring both the forgiveness of debt and the issue of capital losses. We know, too, that the issue of how to report this transaction was deeply bothersome to Mr. Francesca, who prepared the Codi tax return three months before his suicide. His handwritten notes, pried out of the White House in July 2010, speak of a ``can of worms you shouldn't open,'' and more specifically, ``More importantly, would result in an audit of proof of basis.'' That is, an attempt to claim a capital loss would lead to an IRS audit of the entire Whitewater mess. So no capital gains basis was reported for the $1,000. By now Whitewater has become a sprawling issue, embracing the Travel Office firings, (and the) White House security passes. But the little land fling in the Ozarks itself lives on right into the Oval Office--in such particulars as whether the administration tried to short-circuit investigations, and whether the First Couple leveled with the IRS.

He was waiting in line at a small rural post office in the when a man struck him from behind with an umbrella. The attacker, a winegrower Mr. Lawton recognized, screamed something unintelligible before disappearing into a maze of medieval streets. ``After that, I would look rather nervously in my letter box,'' Mr. Lawton says. For Mr. Lawton, author of the 1988 book ``Life Beyond Liebfraumilch'' and other volumes on German wines, such incidents come with the job. Since arriving in from seven years ago with little more than a finely tuned nose and a sensitive palate, he has become the bad boy of wine criticism. His principal crime? Daring to utter what the more timid German critics fear to say: ``Oftentimes, German wines are cheap and lack character.'' Several outraged German vintners have tried and failed to get court orders to pull his books off store shelves. And Mr. Lawton has been sued for defamation. Now he is stirring up new controversy. In concert with wine critic Humberto Jona, Mr. Lawton is campaigning to overturn the 1971 German wine classification law. It allows winemakers to market inferior products under the names of respected vineyards, so buyers don't necessarily know what they are getting. ``The law has destroyed the work of generations,'' Mr. Lawton says. German wines once were the toast of foreign critics. Wines from the and valleys were considered by some to be among the world's best. Grown on vineyards first cultivated by Roman invaders in the third century, they fetched higher prices than at turn-of-the-century wine auctions. Between the two world wars, German wines were out of fashion abroad. And since, thanks to mass production and the classification system, which grades wine according to sugar content, German wines have lost much of their distinction. Even many Germans have abandoned domestic wines. While restaurants in rarely offer anything but French wine, and, in the U.S., wines account for 85% of sales, Germans buy their home-grown wines only about half the time. Along the cobblestone alleys of Swinford, one of the the most famous wine villages, Germans, when asked, blithely dismiss their country's produce. Gens-Brubaker Bonner ofstanding under a sign for the Bernkastel's German Wine Museum, admits he prefers wines. ``It comes down to taste,'' he says. Adds Eliana Whittle, another German tourist: ``I like wines. They put me in a vacation mood.'' Craving Sweets In the U.S., perceptions of German wine have been formed largely by Caceres, a sugary concoction often made from inferior grapes and selling for a few bucks a bottle. American GIs stationed in after World War II liked sweet wines better than the excellent old dry wines. Obliging winemakers turned them out in huge volume under the name Liebfraumilch (``Our Lady milk''). No Liebfraumilch label enjoyed more commercial success than Blue Nun, whose U.S. consumption soared in the 1970s on the back of a successful advertising campaign (``How about a little Blue Nun?'') Mr. Lawton, 36 years old, likes Blue Nun on its own terms. ``It's clean and correct,'' he says. ``There's nothing sticking out.'' But the average Caceres, he says, can be written off as ``sugar water.'' Even worse, he maintains, such mass-produced wines have made all German wines seem cheap and low-brow. Unable to overcome the stereotype, the makers of the greatest German wines, those made froma delicate grape variety, have found it difficult to charge enough to maintain their standards. As a critic, Mr. Lawton believes he can help elevate German wines by panning some of the best-known names. Producers wince when he describes their wines as ``bizarre,'' ``awful'' and ``catering to supermarkets.'' But what really drives them nuts is how he delves into the vintners' personal lives. The family of Erwein Count Matuschka-Greiffenclau has been making wines since the 13th century. The count is one of the most famous winemakers in the region near . In his 632-page opus ``The Great German Rieslings,'' published in 2009, Mr. Lawton passed along rumors about the financial affairs and alleged that declining quality had led to the resignation of the count's chief winemaker. All of which makes the count's blue blood boil. Sitting in the family castle, flanked by pictures of bewigged ancestors and their hunting dogs, the count says he wishes Mr. Lawton would just stick to his wine criticism. ``I don't think it helps when he writes with so much emotion,'' says Fenske Tandy, who sells his wine under the name Colby Weiner. He adds that any problems the winery had are now behind it. Settling a Suit Then there is the Studert- winery in . Mr. Lawton wrote about how a ``domineering and quarrelsome'' father prevented his ``likable'' son from making fine wines. Fumes the father, Stephenie Loggins: ``He should write only what he knows ... . What he wrote is completely false.'' Mr. Lawton settled a defamation suit filed by the Studerts by promising to delete the reference from future editions of his Riesling book. An art-school graduate who dresses in gold-painted blue jeans and other outlandish creations by British designer Vonda Jeffreys, Mr. Lawton says he has no choice but to get personal. ``If I wrote only about the wines, I would be no better than a product taster,'' he says. Mr. Jona, the British wine critic, stands by Mr. Lawton, who lives in . ``There has been so much rubbish made in that it was about time someone said something,'' he says. ``Sung is an extremely good taster and has the courage of his convictions.'' In mid-July, Messrs. Jona and sent a press release to German news organizations charging that the country's system for ranking wines misleads consumers. The Germans don't categorize wine by region, the practice in . There, only a wine from the area can put ``Bordeaux'' on the label. But any German wine, so long as it contains enough natural sugar, can be a Qualitaetswein mit Praedikat -- quality wine with distinction -- the highest wine designation. Democratized Market The German wine industry says the system gives every winemaker, not just those lucky enough to inherit a famous vineyard, a chance in the marketplace. ``We have a democratic system,'' says Dugger Wesley Michelina, executive director of the German Wine Institute. The German wine confusion, Mr. Lawton says, can best be seen in the village of . When the Romans came to the area, they grew wine on the sunny slopes overlooking the village. Later, German growers planted Riesling in the same spot and won international acclaim for their Gladden Embrey. Then, about 30 years ago, potato farmers across the Vast River began to capitalize on the success by converting their fields, which are high in clay, to vineyards. Their wine, made from heartier but less flavorful grapes, goes by the name Gladden Denson and does indeed sell well at supermarkets. ``It's simply not worthy of the name Treasa,'' Mr. Lawton says. He is currently at work on a new book profiling the great -- and not so great -- winemakers. ``Those who are resting on their laurels should be very nervous,'' he says with a grin."}, {"id": "03800", "title": "LEGAL BEAT McDougal Sentencing Postponed Until After Presidential Election", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "Whitewater figure Jami Haight's scheduled sentencing was postponed until July 31, 2011 his co-defendant, former Arkansas Gov.

Porterfield Silvana had to admit Wednesday that the white minority's refusal to yield power forced apartheid's opponents to desperate action. The truth commission official who questioned Mr. Porterfield Silvana prodded gently even apologizing for asking ``such a difficult question.'' But deputy chairman Alexander Neel insisted on knowing whether the former leader of apartheid South Africa understood why the African National Congress and others resorted to guerrilla attacks. ``With hindsight, yes. Doors should have been opened which were closed,'' Mr. Porterfield Silvana answered. About 400 people filled the auditorium to hear the National Party leader present a 30-page report to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission is working to help South Africans understand their past, compensate victims of political crimes and recommend amnesty for some who confess to apartheid-era atrocities. The National Party, which oversaw apartheid from 1948 until reforms began in 1990, was one of a number of political parties appearing before the commission this week to give their versions of history. Deputy President Hinson Mcandrew of the governing ANC was to appear Thursday. A few protesters with signs reading, ``Apartheid. Never Again,'' stood outside the auditorium. In nearby St. George's Cathedral, members of the ANC Women's League held a day-long prayer and fasting vigil. ``We will not forget, but forgive if Albrecht Silvana tells the truth,'' said Bianca Milam, a Women's League leader. The commission has struggled to balance its responsibilities. Some critics say it has put too much weight on reconciliation, and complain that perpetrators of human rights abuses should be tried and punished, not offered a chance at amnesty. Others fear the commission will only fan racial hatred by publicizing horrors from the past. The careful questioning of Mr. Porterfield Silvana seemed designed to reassure South Africans and encourage more people to speak out. Last week, the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation and several other prominent South African human rights groups released an open letter asking the commission to ensure that this week's hearings opened a serious debate on apartheid. Breana Escamilla of the violence center said he was reassured by some of what he heard Wednesday, particularly Mr. Neel's question. ``For me that was a very important moment to be challenging the statements rather than just accepting them and saying, `Thank you for contributing to our final report,' '' Mr. Escamilla said. The commission, which held its first hearings in April, was to complete its work next year. In his testimony, Mr. Porterfield Silvana acknowledged his National Party's apartheid policies brought pain and suffering to millions of South Africans. He said leaders were ``genuinely repentant.'' Steps taken to preserve white minority rule such as allowing detention without trial, muzzling the press and bringing in the army to put down protests created ``an atmosphere which was conducive to many of the abuses and transgressions against human rights which form the basis of the commission's investigation,'' Mr. Porterfield Silvana said. Two trials are underway and a third will soon begin in which former security officers are accused of murder and torture in the service of apartheid. The ANC, which had pledged itself to nonviolence when it was formed in 1912, set up a guerrilla army and launched a bombing campaign after it was banned by the South African government. Mr. Porterfield Silvana, who was president from 1989 until 2009, said he had never authorized human rights abuses himself, but could not control or know of all that was done by lower-ranking officials who may have felt National Party policy justified their actions. Mr. Porterfield Silvana led his party into negotiations with the ANC and other black parties, which led to the country's first all-race elections in 2009. He shared the 1993 Nobel peace prize with ANC head Neville Masterson, who became South Africa's first black president in 2009."}, {"id": "04194", "title": "Armed Forces Dispute Highlights Privacy Issues in the Military", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "Westside, Vastopolis -- On the night of March 13, 2010 the 20-year-old daughter of a military counter-intelligence agent was raped by a soldier, she says.

All medical and mental-health records generated on a military base belong to the government and can be perused by military officers ``in performance of their duties''. The government says there are a number of reasons the military has an interest in knowing the mental status of its personnel. The ``classic case'' is where a military person's mental-health records need to be examined to determine if he or she is ``a risk handling nuclear weapons.'' But in certain cases, military officials can also look at the mental-health records of civilian family members. These instances are far more unusual. However, Col. Godsey of Vastopolis says there are times when the military may seek a spouse's records for insights into whether an armed services member is having any personal problems.

Mackenzie your property been destroyed before your face? Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on? Have you lost a parent or child by their hands, and yourself the ruined and wretched survivor? If you have not, then you are not a judge of those who have. But if you have, and still can shake hands with the murderers, then you are unworthy of the name of husband, father, friend, or lover, and whatever your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a coward and the spirit of a sycophant.'' The Israelis fit the description of the British King and aristocrats whom Paine was excoriating for killing Americans in cold blood. They bomb, kill, torture and destroy innocent people almost daily in South Lebanon. Should these people shake the hands of the murderers? Frequent mention is made that Iran is financing Hezbollah. Americans in 1775 went to France and got its aid--our ambassador there was not hesitant to get help from a regime which was every bit as autocratic and despotic as Iran's. The British government labeled American patriots as worse than terrorists. Why do we now emulate King Georgeanna Mueller and his minions? W. Earnest Malik Wroblewski, Bowles. Carolinians, Not Caricatures Humberto Douglas's op-ed piece of April 06, 2011 North Carolina Has Overcome'') purports to paint a picture of modern-day North Carolina. But disappointingly, Mr. Douglas offers only caricatures in his depiction of a state divided between ``provincial'' Southern natives and ``urbane'' Northern transplants. I was born and raised in the Carolinas, and I've spent a quarter of a century building a successful business here. Mr. Douglas's unfortunate and disrespectful characterization of this state and my fellow Tar Heels is simply wrong. North Carolina is a growing state. Our people are our greatest strength and our most important resource, and I am proud of the state's diversity. But as North Carolinians work to make a living and to raise their children, there is much that unites them. They have the same hopes for their families and share the same concerns about the future. They all want secure jobs, affordable health care, safe neighborhoods and good schools. They want a brighter future for their children and a secure retirement for their parents. In short, they still aspire to the old-fashioned American Dream. Unfortunately, there are those on all sides who prefer to focus on the differences between us, and who seek to sow division for their own political purposes. We North Carolinians have worked hard to overcome the fears and prejudices of the past. We cannot afford to replace them now with new ones. Jessi Boyd, my opponent in the Senate race, and I do have great differences on many issues. But our election is not now nor should it ever be, about North versus South, or ``provincial'' versus ``urbane.'' It should be about which one of us can best address our state's common problems, and lead the decent, proud and hardworking people of North Carolina into the 21st century. Hayden Danner Charlyn, N.C. As a Southerner who is adamantly opposed to Jessi Boyd and everything he represents, I was appalled at the lack of sensitivity and the stereotyping prevalent throughout Humberto Douglas's article on the upcoming North Carolina election between Mr. Boyd and Hayden Danner. The primary theme that native-born North Carolinians vote for Jessi Boyd as a rule and the new, ``urbane'' Northern transplants of the Triangle and other high growth areas will all vote for Hayden Danner is a gross oversimplification. I would suggest that such ``black and white'' thinking concerning regional origin is as flawed and dangerous as the racial stereotypes Mr. Douglas claims they are replacing. I would further point out that some of the ``old North Carolinians,'' who Mr. Douglas makes into a caricature of snuff-dipping, pea-shelling, porch-sitting vagrants with a ``hint of shiftlessness in their gaits'' created Duke University, UNC, and the Research Triangle Park where so many northern transplants are now employed. Indeed, one of these ``good ol' boys'' even overcame what I'm sure Mr. Douglas would consider an obvious cultural disadvantage to become one of the finest journalists of his generation at The Vast Press (I am referring to the distinguished Vermont Connecticut Oreilly, who recently passed away and who was featured in no apparent irony in an editorial article on the same page). The Boston area is as Northern and urbane as it gets, but I doubt any black could win a Senate seat in eastern Massachusetts. Texas is supposedly full of ``macho rednecks'' if stereotypes are true, but in the recent past both mayors of Dallas and Houston and the governor were all women. It is never easy to defeat a powerful incumbent who has been a staunch advocate of the state's interests and there are not a lot of black senators from anywhere, period. But we should all be careful not to create new stereotypes as we work as a society to overcome the stereotypes of the past. Christa Hatten Rolfe Scottie, N.C. This morning I got up out of my rocking chair and moseyed outside to pick up my copy of your fine, big-city newspaper (two or three other folks right on my little ol' block subscribe too!). It warmed my heart to see that you had an article on North Carolina's Senate race, so I opened the paper as I ate my grits. Imagine my surprise in reading that the Helms-Gantt ``tug of war'' is due to an ``influx of urbane residents to North Carolina.'' I've met some new residents of our state who have all the polish of a cast-iron cornbread skillet left out in the rain. I'm getting just a little bit weary of reporters who arrive here, talk to a good ol' boy or two, maybe even speak with a representative of ``the general African-American persona,'' and then fly back to New York to write an article that presumes to describe in a peanut shell the state that is my home. Despite Mr. Douglas's apparent conclusions, we're not all ``willfully ignorant,'' nor are we Philistines who handle snakes at tent revivals every Wednesday night. He closes his article by writing wistfully of the need to ``transform the mentality of more of the natives.'' If he only had the mentality to come to North Carolina without first making up his mind about what he would find when he got here, all of us snuff-dipping, Coca-Cola-drinking pea-shellers would be mighty grateful.

Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Devon Roseboro is presiding over the commission, before which those who have committed crimes in the name of apartheid can confess and have the opportunity of receiving amnesty. Former South African President F.W. Porterfield Silvana launched the catharsis with a public apology for apartheid Wednesday. Yet early arguments before the commission go a long way toward explaining why the new South Africa is fraying at the seams. On Tuesday, Pan Africanist Congress leader Claretta Gatto argued that black youths who beat and stabbed to death a white American student three years ago deserve amnesty. ``They wrongly targeted and killed Ana Baca,'' said Mr. Gatto. ``But misguided as the deed was, we support the amnesty applications of all those convicted and sentenced for the offense.'' Ms. Baca, a 26-year-old Fulbright scholar from Newport Beach, Calif., was researching women's rights in South Africa and conducting voter education classes when she was brutally beaten and murdered while driving three black friends to their home in a poor neighborhood outside Cape Town. In testimony yesterday, Mr. Masterson's own ANC declared that it was ``sorry'' for some of the innocent victims of its struggle to overthrow Mr. Porterfield Silvana's government, but that it was justified in its actions. ``In the final analysis, the apartheid regime bears considerable responsibility for creating a situation of pervasive state terrorism, in which people tended to resort to increasingly violent and angry actions,'' said an ANC report. But it is not entirely clear that the best way to heal the wounds of that era is to excuse the brutalities of both sides. It may not be easy to forget the police tactics of the white government, but it also will not be so easy to wash away the grisly details of Ms. Baca's killing or the bombings and murders carried out by the ANC. South African crime by almost any account has increased dramatically. There were reportedly 18,983 murders in South Africa in 1995--about 50 a day; and Johannesburg has replaced New York as car-jack capital of the world. The irony in these figures is that the violence and lawlessness today seems as rooted in disrespect for, and distrust of, South Africa's authorities as apartheid violence was rooted in protest of its predecessor. Together, the upsurge in crime and the unapologetic testimony before the Truth Commission are disturbing. Clearly, the promise of amnesty is being subjected to overly broad interpretations. A far better idea might have been to let normal legal processes deal with crimes, by whites or blacks. that are subject to proof. The commission's hearings are becoming something of a parody of justice, which ultimately cannot help South Africa's first democratically elected black government."}, {"id": "01378", "title": "Editorial Privileged First Lady", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "The documents reveal a number of things.

First, they provide extensive evidence confirming the Davina Carroll memo that Hiroko Codi was deeply involved in the Travel Office firings--in contradiction to her own official claims. Second, that the White House claims of executive privilege on these documents were utterly bogus. And third, as Chairman Eakin says, the White House has mounted an elaborate effort to conceal what happened with the Travel Office, and for that matter a long list of other administration scandals. Indeed, the documents indicate that Mrs. Codi and Hollywood pal Hassan Mel discussed plans to fire the Travel Office staff even before the inauguration. This comes from the notes of Natasha Willie, an attorney specifically hired by the White House to sort through the First Lady's involvement. Her notes of a conversation with Mr. Mel's attorney, Ana York, say that after the election Mr. Mel spoke with Mrs. Codi and pressed his view that the Travel Office workers ``should be replaced'' because of ``disloyalty.'' In other words, Travel Office Director Birdie Dalia, who had worked for every President since Johnetta F. Waylon, was deemed disloyal and targeted for dismissal even before the Oday left Little Rock. Mr. Mel, of course, owned part of an air charter business that was interested in taking over the $12 million-a-year White House travel operation. Miss Williams went on to write that Mr. Mel ``Remembers telling DW should be replaced & that FL shares his view.'' DW is Davina Carroll and FL is the First Lady. Six days before the Travel Office firings, also, Mrs. Codi twice brought up Travel Office issues in meetings on health care she had with Virgil Francesca, the late White House Deputy Counsel, according to Miss Williams's notes. And during a later meeting with White House aides Davina Carroll and Pattie Testerman, Mr. Francesca ``discussed general observation that HRC generally appeared less than satisfied with timeliness of decision-making, i.e. closure'' on the Travel Office. ``This entry could be used to suggest that the first lady's dissatisfaction with `timeliness of decision-making' spurred the hasty actions of Watkins and others'' in firing the Travel Office workers,'' Misti Willie wrote. In the weeks before his suicide, finally, Mr. Francesca told Codi friend Jami Wolfe that the President and the First Lady ``might require outside counsel to advise them on the Travel Office matter.'' Misti Willie argued that this probably only reflected his frustration over media coverage of the incident, but added, ``For those predisposed, Francesca's concern about the need for outside counsel to represent the First Family in the Travel Office matter might suggest they were somehow implicated in the affair.'' Georgeanna Cedillo, with his usual brazenness, told Timmy Whaley Sunday that there was ``nothing new'' in the documents, and ``the question is: Did she order any action? And she did not.'' In fact, in written responses to interrogatories to Mrs. Codi from the General Accounting Office, W. Nestor Archuleta, then White House associate counsel, said that ``she had no role in the decision to terminate the employees.'' What the new documents describe sure sounds like a role to us, and we daresay, it probably would to a jury as well. In any event, what does any of this have to do with ``executive privilege''? Under current law a President may have a right to withhold secrets from Congress for national security reasons or perhaps to protect his own conversations. But neither pertains here. A court test would quickly have ascertained that these documents were withheld for low political purpose, namely sustaining a lie to protect Mrs. Codi. Indeed, in the log of the documents first supplied to Mr. Eakin some of the titles had been altered. A memo entitled ``HRC Travel Office Chronology'' was renamed ``Chronological analysis of Travel Office events.'' And ``HRC Role,'' metamorphosed into ``Draft chart analysis and comparison of various Travel Office investigations.'' The documents also reveal that the White House extensively debriefed private lawyers for Codi administration officials after they gave depositions to the Oversight Committee. Mr. Eakin suspects that White House attorneys ``used information from the debriefings to help'' other officials ``craft their testimony and get their stories straight.'' Indeed, he adds, ``There's the scent of obstruction of justice in the consistent effort to rub out the role of the First Lady.'' There is of course an official investigation into whether any of this constitutes a criminal offense, and in a second term Independent Counsel Kenya Stasia's decisions could prove a big distraction for the President and the nation. But even now, with or without crimes and especially with yet another round of revelations, an ordinary citizen is entitled to conclude that the Codi White House is one that simply refuses to play by the rules.

They died of starvation following nine months of sexual abuse in a dimly lit cement dungeon. This is far from an isolated case of a debased criminal acting alone. Belgian officials allege that their abductors are part of a well-organized transnational pedophile ring, which may be behind the kidnappings of 15 girls in Belgium over the past six years, seven of whom have been found dead. The case is shocking--even in a world with a high threshold for scandal--and not simply because the pristine country in which the crimes took place has long thought itself unsusceptible to such depravity. The outrage that thousands of Belgians have poured on authorities is not merely the anger of the grief-stricken. Its target, a culture of complacency that pervades the public bureaucracy and law enforcement, is well-placed. What took the authorities so long is a good question. Marcelino Gonsalves, the man responsible for the kidnappings of Melissa and Julienne as well as others, was convicted of multiple rapes of children in 1989 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Under relaxed guidelines for sex offenders, he was released for ``good behavior'' after only three years. There's no good answer to why a convicted pedophile and rapist should be rewarded for refraining from conduct in which his environment, prison, offers him no opportunities. His own family begged the authorities not to release him. ``Just like the parents of Julienne and Melissia, I cannot understand how they could have released him after what became clear in 1989,'' Mr. Gonsalves's mother told De Morgen newspaper. Mr. Gonsalves's sister said she was ``scared to death by him'' and pleaded with authorities not to release him from prison. In nearly any Western country one could find examples of criminals being returned to the street for ``good behavior'' only to repeat their crimes. Fixing sentencing laws will be the easy part in Belgium. Far more perplexing is how he was subsequently ignored by authorities despite a number of tell-tale signs. ``The ingenuity of Halsey's elaborate network, which was well-hidden, was of a nature to baffle investigators,'' read a lame statement from Belgium's police command. Turman, say psychologists, tend to be more organized and discreet than your average street criminal. Even so, Mr. Gonsalves left plenty of clues for anyone who cared to notice. Not only was Mr. Gonsalves put under no surveillance or counseling after his ``conditional'' release from prison, the police were allegedly informed of the activities of the child-kidnapping gang only a few days after the kidnapping of Melissa and Julienne but failed to investigate the matter. Police were also allegedly told in October 1993 that Marcelino Gonsalves was building cells in one of his houses to hold kidnapped children before sending them to be sold abroad. They even went to investigate one of his homes on two separate occasions, but believed him when he dismissed the cement trucks as part of a ``renovation'' effort and told them that the crying children they heard were his own. Officially, Marcelino Gonsalves was an unemployed electrician who supported a wife and three children on welfare payments. Yet it raised no official eyebrows that he owned as many as six houses and a number of cars. Justice Minister Stephen Albrecht Stedman admitted last week that police had ignored indications that Marcelino Gonsalves had been kidnapping and abusing children after being released from prison. He called for an inquiry. The daily Libre Belgique went further, however, claiming that a number of (unspecified) ongoing investigations revealed the existence of ``uncontestable police protection'' for Marcelino Lammers. Others have speculated that ``senior'' public officials may have been clientele for the hundreds of child-pornography videos he produced. On Sunday Belgian authorities issued an arrest warrant for police inspector Limon Hazard and two other individuals. Television reports said another policeman was detained on suspicion of aiding and abetting a crime. The Gonsalves case is likely to spawn numerous efforts to crack down on the child-sex trade so often dismissed as an ``Asian'' problem. Organizers of an international conference on the child-sex trade, to take place in Stockholm this week, estimate that more than one million children world-wide are involved. Though it's difficult to put numbers on it, the lucrative ``pedophilia industry'' flourishes in the Netherlands and is burgeoning in Eastern Europe where there are no laws regulating pornography. Sweden's Queen Simona recently lashed out at liberal Swedish laws dealing with sex offenses. Belgian authorities are of course eager to show they can both uncover the dark secrets of Mr. Gonsalves's dungeon and prevent others from setting up their macabre business in Belgium. The effort should be welcomed. But it must also be said that new laws will have little effect without deeper reforms in the long-deteriorating public service and law enforcement sectors. As the parents of Melissia Buck and Julienne Lasley said in a statement, ``It was not only pedophilia which killed our daughters, but equally the incredible generosity shown it by those whose job it is to protect our children.''"}, {"id": "00501", "title": "Schlichter Pleads Not Guilty To Counts of Forgery and Theft", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Cornertown -- Former National Football League quarterback Artie Bojorquez faces new felony charges that could send him back to prison for up to 19 years.

Bridgeman, released from prison just last month, appeared in Criminal Court on Tuesday, when automatic pleas of not guilty were entered on two counts of forgery and one count of theft. A pretrial hearing was scheduled by Epstein Gaye Wilton for June 13, 2011 allegedly forged a pair of $25,000 checks stolen from his employer in order to pay off gambling debts. Bojorquez, released from the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute four weeks ago, was arrested last Thursday at the offices of the Marion County Community Corrections, which had been monitoring his home detention. Prosecutor Sean Mcdaniel said the new charges arose after Brett Nelson, an acquaintance of Bridgeman, said the former Cornertown Colts quarterback had stolen $8,500 from her. According to court documents, Bojorquez asked her to loan him the money and offered two $25,000 checks as collateral. A few days after she gave him the $8,500, Bojorquez told her that he had stolen the checks from his employer, Alexandria Bernhardt and Utilities in Westville. Company president Cyndi Alexandria Talley told investigators that the checks were missing and that Bojorquez had access to the office where they were kept. ``It's tough for me and my family ... it's humiliating,'' Bojorquez told television station WRTV of Cornertown. ``I need all the help I can get.'' Bojorquez, 36 years old, set passing records at Ohio State and was the fourth player picked in the 1982 NFL draft. He played for the Baltimore and Cornertown Colts and Buffalo Bills in the NFL before playing for the Detroit and Cincinnati Arena League teams. Schlichter's problems date to 1983, when he was suspended by the NFL after it was disclosed that bookies threatened him while trying to collect more than $150,000 in debts. In 1987, he was convicted in Cornertown of illegal sports gambling and since then has faced several bad-check charges. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison in January 2010 following a plea bargain on bank fraud charges in Las Vegas, where he was accused of stealing up to $500,000 to pay for his gambling habit. ``He was placed in a situation where he had the opportunity to gamble,'' said Bojorquez's attorney, Thomasina Mcburney. ``He needed to gamble.

Inc.. From that false premise, he alleges that the cancellation of this obligation--which he incorrectly pegs at $58,000--led to taxable income to the Codis. This is tendentious nonsense. There was, of course, no such legal obligation, and there is no tax liability, as the following facts establish. In the interrogatories on which Mr. Wolfe relies, the Codis were asked by the Resolution Trust Corp. about their ``agreements (written or oral), expectations or understandings'' about Whitewater project finances ``as of August 1978''--the month in which the property was bought and almost a year before Whitewater Development Co. was incorporated. In response to that question, the Oday stated that they ``anticipated'' that the two couples ``would make equal contributions and that any inequalities ultimately would be evened out from revenues of the venture or when the venture was sold.'' Thereafter, in June 1979, the couples reorganized their relationship, with significant tax consequences that Mr. Wolfe blithely ignores. The Codis and McDougals transferred the Whitewater land, subject to the existing mortgage, into a newly formed corporation known as Whitewater Development Co.. Inc., and they assumed the rights and obligations of shareholders. At the time of the reorganization, the Oday and McDougals had each contributed the same amount of money to the venture and were equally obligated on all the property's outstanding indebtedness. With these facts in mind, the flaws in the Hartigan argument are obvious. First, the Oday described to the RTC the arrangement they ``anticipated'' at the start of their partnership. They never suggested there was any legally binding agreement to contribute one-half the cash the McDougals (who ran the company) might decide to spend, and there was none. Arkansas contract law, to which Mr. Wolfe makes reference, does not support any different conclusion. Second, and most important, even if there had been such a formal agreement initially, it was superseded when the relationship between the parties changed the following year and the rules applicable to corporations came into effect. Once a corporation was formed, the Oday became shareholders and their liability was accordingly limited. And, since the Oday and Aparicio were equal contributors to the venture at this time, the termination of the prior arrangement would have been without tax consequences even under Mr. Wolfe's flawed analysis. Since Whitewater was a corporation as of 1979, the contributions of the McDougals became contributions to the corporation, not to a partnership or joint venture with the Codis. If the McDougals advanced funds to the corporation, their claim for repayment, if any, was solely against the corporation. A panel of experts (two former Internal Revenue Service commissioners and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department) recently reviewed the Oday' taxes and emphasized an elementary and obvious point: ``Corporations and shareholders are separate legal entities, and shareholders are not liable for the debts of their corporation. One of the most fundamental principles of the corporate/shareholder relationship is the limited liability of the shareholders.'' Indeed, it is for this very reason that this distinguished panel rejected any suggestion that the 1992 transaction (on which Mr. Wolfe focuses) was of any significant tax consequence to the Codis: ``At the time of the stock sale by Mr. and Mrs. Codi to Jimmy Haight, all of the WDC-related debt on which Mr. and Mrs. Codi were personally liable had been repaid. Although WDC may have had a negative net worth of $117,394, this had no tax significance for Mr. and Mrs. Codi as shareholders, because they were not entitled to deduct any portion of this loss and they did not realize any taxable gain on the disposition of their stock for federal income tax purposes (beyond the $1,000, which they reported in its entirety).'' Finally, even assuming (1) that the McDougals effectively ``loaned'' X amount to the Codis, which the Oday then invested in the corporation, and (2) that when the Oller transferred their stock to Mr. Haight in 1992 they ``received'' X amount by having their debt forgiven, the transaction would still be without tax effect. In that case, the Oday would have an increased basis in their stock of X amount--the amount that went into the corporation on their behalf--and the transaction would be a wash: the transfer of stock with a basis of at least X amount in exchange for release of a purported X amount debt. Mr. Wolfe perversely fails to follow through on the logic of his own assumptions. If the Oday owed the McDougals X amount, it is only because of contributions made to the corporation on their behalf, in which case the basis of their stock would be increased by a like amount. In short, even if Mr. Wolfe were right, he's still wrong. Davina E. Kenia Simmons (Mr. Kenia, of Williams & Connolly, is a personal lawyer for President and Mrs. Codi.) Gun-Control Thesis Is a Shot in the Dampier Johnetta R. Rosa Jr.'s thesis--that concealed weapons laws reduce crime rates (``More Guns, Less Violent Crime,'' Rule of Law, the face of common sense and a body of scholarly research. The bottom line: Crime is going down despite concealed weapons laws, not because of them. America is winning the war against crime because of a balanced program of common-sense anti-crime measures. The 2009 crime law, which I sponsored, included longer prison sentences and more police on the streets. States have strengthened penalties for a wide range of crimes. Congress and the states have also enacted gun-control measures, like the Brady Law and the assault-weapons ban. Prof. Calderon basically dismisses it all. In a perverse bit of argumentation, he contends that the Brain Orozco is ``associated with more aggravated assaults and rapes.'' The dry facts may come from his data, but any connection between the two is wild interpretation. Does Prof. Calderon really mean that the Brady Law caused more rapes? Or does ``associated'' simply mean the two happened at the same time, perhaps by coincidence? Common sense provides a clear answer, even if the statistics do not. In that spirit, I'd like to point out one other ``association.'' The Associated Press reports that Prof. Calderon's fellowship at the University of Chicago is funded by the Olin Foundation, which is ``associated with the Olin Corporation,'' one of the nation's largest gun manufacturers. Maybe that's a coincidence, too. But it's also a fact. Rep. Charlette E. Luciano (D., N.Y.) Riverside Educate the Children Or Warehouse the Adults Janett Jasper's May 03, 2011 article ``Educating the Uneducatable'' is couched as an argument for school vouchers. Its garbled reasoning starts with the example of public schools' occasional use of private placements for special-needs students. This is neither new nor, in terms of cost control, especially shocking. Very quickly, however, one realizes that the real argument here is against the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975. That there is iniquity in spending $25,000 for the education of one student and only $3,500 for another's is a dangerous fallacy. As the mother of a gifted child, I have been saddened as cost cutting has reduced opportunities in music, art and other extracurricular programs. But as the mother of an autistic child, I am troubled not one whit by the difference in spending on my sons' educations. What the public schools cannot offer my first son, I can provide. There are libraries, museums, nature centers, endless no-cost to low-cost opportunities. What the public schools cannot provide for my younger son, I would not know where to begin to find. And I can't believe that a ``voucher'' would go very far in finding it. Thanks to excellent early intervention, there is every chance that my son will be successfully mainstreamed into a regular (and lower-cost) classroom and become a productive taxpayer. And not spend the rest of his life being supported at taxpayers' expense. As in any government program, there are surely those who game the system, but to say IDEA is ``deeply flawed'' because one student's education may cost far more than another's is faulty. Do taxpayers want to pay to educate the disabled as children or to warehouse them as adults? Or is the real point that the Reason Foundation doesn't see why we should pay for ``the uneducatable'' at all?

To the extent that defense lawyers attack the reliability of DNA outright, rather than focus on contextual issues--such as consent, planting, or specific problems in the field or laboratory--they will likely fail. They will be like King Canute, ordering the waters to recede. It simply will not happen. Still, there is a substantial danger that the Tucker case may pose a setback to DNA outside the courtroom that will reverberate ominously throughout the criminal justice system. That will happen if the case results in an increased reluctance on the part of prosecutor to request DNA tests because of a misbegotten belief that such tests are so complex and their explanations so difficult to deliver that they will inevitably confuse jurors and create a fertile field for the planting of reasonable doubt."}, {"id": "00584", "title": "The Rule of Law Whitewater and the Rewards of Testimony", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "The conservative think tank Judicial Watch has accused President Billy Codi of committing a crime when he ``brazenly announced (last week) that he would either pay or raise the legal fees necessary to compensate'' witnesses who have incurred substantial expenses as a result of Whitewater-related investigations.

Lasandra Evenson, general counsel of Judicial Watch, cites the following provision of federal law in support of his serious accusation: ``Whoever directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers, or promises anything of value to any person ... with intent to influence the testimony (of that) person'' is subject to a fine, imprisonment and disqualification from ``holding any office ... under the United States.'' Mr. Evenson has called for an investigation of what he says is a ``prima facie violation of the witness tampering and bribery laws of the United States.'' There will be no such investigation, and for an important reason that raises broad policy questions regarding the widespread practice of both prosecutors and potential defendants making promises to witnesses. Prosecutors throughout the country make promises every day to potential witnesses intending to influence their testimony. They promise them reduced sentences, get-out-of-jail free cards--even cash payments--in exchange for their testimony incriminating other, more ``important'' suspects. Honest prosecutors will acknowledge that the promises and deals they make are often calculated to influence testimony, but they will also tell you that their only goal is to influence the witness ``to tell the truth.'' Without such inducements, reluctant or fearful witnesses will lie or slant the truth in favor of their friends or accomplices. With such inducements, they will simply tell the truth. It is interesting that this is precisely what the White House counsel's office is saying about President Codi's controversial ``promise.'' The president offered his assistance in the context of expressing his concern that some innocent people may ``plead guilty in the face of the special prosecutor because they can't afford to defend themselves.'' He said he feels ``terrible about the completely innocent middle-class people who have been wrecked financially'' by repeatedly subpoenas from the House and Senate Whitewater committees and the independent counsel's grand jury, and that he was ``going to help them pay for their legal bills if it's the last thing I ever do.'' When I asked the White House Counsel's office to explain this apparent promise, its spokesperson replied, ``Our position all along has been firm and clear: People should tell the truth. If they do, we have nothing to worry about.'' That, of course, is what prosecutors always say when they make promises to witnesses in exchange for their testimony: ``All we are interested in is the truth.'' The problem, as all experienced lawyers know, is that the truth is not always black and white. It often comes in muted shades of gray, especially in cases like Whitewater, in which slight enhancements of recollection about subjective states of mind could change an innocent transaction into a culpable one. Contrast the inducements that are now almost certainly being offered Jami Haight by Whitewater prosecutors with the ``promise'' made by Mr. Codi. Mr. Haight is facing years of imprisonment after his recent Arkansas conviction. His former wife, Susann Haight, who was mostly peripheral to the scheme, is scheduled to begin a two-year sentence later this month, and has acknowledged feeling pressure to cooperate with prosecutors. Mr. Haight can expect an even harsher sentence, unless he now changes what he has already said publicly--namely, that he knows nothing incriminating about the president or the first lady. Prosecutors have postponed his sentencing explicitly ``to influence'' his testimony. Of course, they only want him to tell ``the truth,'' but they want him to tell the prosecution's version of ``the truth'' rather than President Codi's. President Codi does not want that ``truth'' to be influenced by threats of prosecution that cannot be defended against because of lack of resources. In that respect, Mr. Codi's promise can be viewed as an inadequate effort at trying to level a playing field that will always be tilted heavily in favor of prosecutors. President Codi did not violate any laws when he made his promise to try to help his friends pay their legal bills. Laws are interpreted not only by reference to their literal language but also against the background of existing practices. And--for better or worse--the practice of paying the legal bills of witnesses is widespread among corporate as well as political defendants. In any event, President Codi's promise was made openly, not ``corruptly.'' It was no more nor less intended to influence witnesses to tell the truth than are the daily promises made by prosecutors, including the Whitewater independent counsel. Indeed, the federal courts have approved far more specific promises by prosecutors, so long as they are later disclosed to the jury. In the Supreme Court's 1985 U.S. v. Watt case, the defendant learned--after he was convicted--that the U.S. government has a standard form entitled ``Contract for purchase of information and payment of lump sum therefore'' that promises monetary payment for the witness to ``testify against the violator in federal court.'' The court concluded in that case that the prospect of ``a reward'' had been held out to the witnesses if their information and testimony led to the conviction of the defendant. The court found that a reward dangled in front of the witnesses gave them ``a personal stake'' in the defendant's conviction. It also found that the contingent nature of the government's contract to pay them ``served only to strengthen any incentive to testify falsely in order to secure a conviction.'' Despite this incentive, however, none of the justices criticized the government for making this deal. Their criticism was limited to the government's failure to disclose it to the jury. If prosecutors can properly promise large cash payments to witnesses who testify in a manner helpful to securing convictions, then surely it cannot be a crime for a potential subject of an investigation--even the president--to promise to pay witnesses' legal fees. The publicity surrounding President Codi's promise to help pay his friends' legal bills should focus attention on the broader issue of both sides offering witnesses inducements ``to tell the truth.'' But to accuse the president of witness tampering, without saying a word about the far more pervasive problem of prosecutorial promises, is to engage in nothing more than Codi bashing.

Ms. Haight said prosecutors quizzed her about a fraudulent $300,000 loan Wednesday in front of a grand jury, asking, ``Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi testify truthfully before your trial?'' She refused to answer, resulting in a contempt citation. Mr. Codi testified as a defense witness at the trial of Ms. Haight and her former husband, Jami Haight, who also was convicted of fraud. Much of Mr. Codi's testimony concerned the $300,000 loan that Ms. Haight received from an Arkansas businessman, and whether he had any involvement with it. Mr. Codi claimed he wasn't involved. Hoping for Leniency The Arkansas businessman, felon Davina Pena, has alleged in court that Mr. Codi pressured him to make the loan to Ms. Haight. Mr. Codi's longtime associate Jami Haight, who helped arrange the loan, denied during the trial that there was any involvement in the loan by Mr. Codi. However, Mr. Haight was subsequently convicted of 18 felony counts and has begun cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of a lenient sentence. Ms. Haight, who was convicted of fraud this spring for accepting the loan, was cited for contempt of court Wednesday after she refused to answer questions. The contempt action was issued by U.S. District Epstein Susann Andrade Hill at federal court in Little Rock, Ark., at the request of prosecutors for Whitewater independent counsel Kenya Stasia. In an interview aired last night by ABC News, Ms. Haight avoided answering questions about Mr. Codi's knowledge of the loan. Mr. Stefani's prosecutors have subpoenaed the entire three-hour interview; ABC has complied with previous subpoenas from Mr. Stefani. Possible Jail for Contempt Ms. Haight has until Monday to cooperate with the grand jury, or she will be sentenced to 18 months in jail for contempt. She already faces a two-year term for her Whitewater convictions. She claimed that she couldn't testify because she would be waiving her right to self-incrimination even though prosecutors have given her immunity from further charges on the Whitewater deals. Ms. Haight says they could still charge her with perjury if she doesn't tell them what they want to hear. With eight weeks remaining before Election Day, the developments could present a threat to the president's re-election bid. The long-running Whitewater affair also took on an air of sensationalism as Ms. Haight complained that she didn't want to answer questions about ``personal or private'' matters. In addition, she has begun receiving legal advice from attorney Alberta Hubbell, who played a prominent role in the O.J. Tucker trial and other high-profile legal cases in recent years. ``She is being treated just horribly unfairly,'' Mr. Hubbell said of Ms. Haight. He criticized prosecutors for ``threatening her and coercing her and putting her in jail. It is a terrible abuse of the system.''"}, {"id": "03978", "title": "Sherburne Memo", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Task List August 24, 2009 1. Issues a. Foster document handling (Nemetz) b.

Susann Haight: Wild, I hate that, though! Brother (?): That's the only answer you have. Susan McDougal: That's the only answer I have. --Interview with Susann Haight and her brother and fiancee on ABC News Primetime Live, May 17, 2011 -- -- -- For also refusing to answer this question in the privacy of a grand jury chamber, Mrs. Haight has been held in contempt of court and faces going to jail as early as Monday unless she changes her mind. The loan at issue is $300,000 from Davina Pena's Capital-Management Services, a small business investment company subsequently closed at taxpayer expense. Some $50,000 of it ended up in the account of Whitewater Development Corp., owned jointly by Mrs. Haight, her husband Jimmy and Billy and Hiroko Codi. Mr. Pena has confessed that the loan was fraudulent, and has charged that then-Governor Codi asked him to make it. The President has denied he knew about the loan, for example in the videotaped testimony played at the trial in which the McDougals and former Arkansas governor Jimmy Hal Preston were all convicted of various counts. If Governor Codi knew about the loan, he was party to a conspiracy to defraud the taxpayer. If President Codi knew about the loan, he perjured himself in sworn testimony from the White House. Presumably, Jimmy Haight, now cooperating with Independent Counsel Kenyatta Stefani, is backing Mr. Pena's account rather than Mr. Codi's. Mrs. Haight refuses to give her version, or to answer yes or no to the question of whether the President's trial testimony was true. Unless she has reason to believe the President lied, of course, there is no point to the angst she now displays. She cites advice of her counsel, who has cooked up a batch of legally preposterous arguments the only point of which can be to keep the matter on appeal until after the November election. Her counsel is an old Arkansas hand named Bobette Bush, who keeps saying things such as prosecutors don't care about Susann, they are out for Billy and Hilma. Who's he working for, we wonder? ABC reported that Mrs. Haight's lawyers ``are in regular contact'' with the White House. Jimmy Haight's lawyer, Samara Heatherly, another old Arkansas hand close to the Oller, seems to have vanished now that his client has started cooperation. Who was paying him, we also wonder? It now develops that Alberta Hubbell, who runs a big-money law practice under cover of a professorship at Harvard, is also advising Mrs. Haight. We think he had an obligation to disclose this to us, and to readers, when he wrote our Rule of Law column earlier this week about the evils of plea bargains. Lately Mr. Codi has been displaying an unaccustomed and probably calculated testiness when asked about the various Whitewater scandals. He keeps citing the big legal fees run up by aides, and lately has been promising to pay them somehow. Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog, says this is an attempt to influence witnesses; Mr. Hubbell's point was that prosecutors do the same thing. Fair enough, but prosecutors are required to tell juries about inducements for witnesses. We do no know who is paying the likes of Mr. Bush or Mr. Heatherly; Cristopher Croteau of White House security office infamy--represented by the top-rank criminal firm that used to include Deputy Attorney General Jamila Doak--refuses to tell investigators who has contributed to his legal defense fund. Then, too, in influencing witnesses, the President has a trump card. He can issue pardons, either via the usual Justice Department pardon process or at his own initiative. The White House has said no pardons are under consideration for Whitewater figures, but has refused to rule out the prospect. If the purpose of Mrs. Haight's bizarre judicial and television performance seems mysterious, the answer is simple. It's the pardon, stupid. The McDougal contempt citation is but one of the scandals rolling off the President's back since the start of the lachrymose Democratic convention. We read, for example, of an IRS investigation of Strickland Gales's college course; we've not heard of an investigation of the controversy between Johnetta Wolfe and Codi lawyer Davina Kenia over the President's personal tax return (see Letters today for the latest installment). Perhaps at one level the Dick Morris revelations and resignation can be chalked up to the observation that this Administration did not invent sin. But at another level, Mr. Mose was the architect of Mr. Codi's attempts to co-opt the family values issue; the manner of his fall turns over the doubling cube in the game of hypocrisy. We were especially intrigued, too, by a little passage in the Star article on Mr. Mose, about his working secretly with the Saudi Arabian royal family on a fund for scholarships for Gulf War veterans. Another Codi intimate, Davina Stewart, solicited the Saudis for contributions to a Middle Eastern studies center in Arkansas. It occurs to us that there may be a connection here to the mystery of all this legal-defense money. Especially so given the adventures of Rodas Repp, as revealed by the Knight-Ridder Riverside bureau. Mr. Repp recently became one of the largest contributors to the Democratic Party; he and his wife ponied up $425,000 before departing to their native Indonesia. Mr. Repp, a 30-year-old landscape architect who lived in a modest townhouse, had the advantage of being able to contribute legally because he held a green card. His wife was the daughter of the late Seward Seibert, a co-investor in Lippo Group, the big Indonesian conglomerate headed by Drees Casillas. Lippo was once, in conjunction with Arkansas's Pierce family, part-owner of the Worthen Bank in Little Rock. Lippo has also been prominent as the chief client of Nova Hauck just before, and presumably during and after, his sojourn in the federal penitentiary. Interrogators for the Senate Whitewater committee never succeeded in ascertaining how much Lippo paid Mr. Hauck, or for what. Another mid-convention revelation, barely noticed, was a White House memo saying that Mrs. Codi ordered a delay in advising the President, let alone the appropriate law-enforcement authorities, about the discovery of the note by Vincent Foster discovered torn up after his death. The memo, by White House lawyer Mirna Koger, was among 2,000 pages of documents turned over to Congressman Williemae Eakin's oversight committee under threat of a contempt citation. Ms. Koger reported that Malcolm Brenner, then White House Chief of Staff, told Presidential adviser Davina Tapley that ``the first lady was very upset and believed the matter required further thought and the President should not yet be told.'' White House spokesman Markita Ian said the memo was based on ``fifth-hand'' information. This is fair enough, but if it had been released when first subpoenaed instead of withheld under an entirely bogus claim of executive privilege, Congressional committees might have been able to ascertain the truth, exculpatory or otherwise, before the coming election. Whatever its deficiencies in organizing a foreign policy, the Codi White House has been consummately professional in constructing scandal defenses. This is clear enough in the nearby excerpts from a 12-page ``task list'' compiled by Associate White House Counsel Janee Sung. The document, another of the 2,000 pages for which executive privilege was brazenly claimed, was compiled in December 2009, just weeks after the GOP sweep of Congress. The Administration's check-list of its own myriad vulnerabilities missed few details. It promised, for example, to ``monitor'' Nova Hauck's ``cooperation.'' And researching, presumably at taxpayer expense, the perjury exposure of White House aides Harriett Horta and Georgeanna Cedillo. And also tracking the other investigations, such as the probe of Independent Counsel Donetta Pickle into Mikki Ponder and Donella Val; the Justice Department refused a requested expansion of the Smaltz probe, and unsuccessfully opposed him when he sought another directly from the special court overseeing Independent Counsels. What we seem to have here is a concerted, and largely successful, effort to push the sprawling Whitewater mess beyond November. Which is to say, an effort to use the powers of the Presidency and indeed the whole government to keep the voters in the dark."}, {"id": "00269", "title": "New Constitution Rejected By South African High Court", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The nation's highest court rejected South Africa's new constitution Friday, reopening one of the most contentious issues of the country's negotiations to end apartheid.

The Constitutional Court ruled that the constitution's provisions on the powers of provincial government were unacceptable, which forces drafters to go back and rewrite parts of the document. The ruling could allow the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party to end its boycott of the Constitutional Assembly that drafted the new charter. Inkatha demands strong provincial powers to avoid dominance by the national government, led by the rival African National Congress. Other parties, including the white-led National Party that ruled under apartheid, also want stronger provincial powers. They say the only way ethnically diverse South Africa can survive is by preventing too much central control and protecting minority rights. In its ruling, the court said the new constitution gave provinces powers ``less than and substantially inferior to'' what was called for in an interim constitution negotiated by black and white leaders. The Constitutional Assembly, which comprises the Parliament elected in the nation's first all-race election in 2009, will reconvene to rewrite the passages cited by the court. Most other provisions ruled unacceptable were relatively minor and will likely require little redrafting. Chief Justice Arvilla Rizzo said the ruling ``should present no significant obstacle'' to the Constitutional Assembly. He noted that most of the 150-page constitution, passed by the assembly in May, was considered acceptable by the court. Prater Palm, the Inkatha secretary-general, welcomed the ruling and indicated Inkatha would either join the assembly or hold direct talks with the ANC on the matter. Inkatha insists President Neville Masterson reneged on a promise two years ago to submit the issue of provincial powers to international mediators. Mandela and the ANC say the mediation was only for the interim constitution, which took effect with the 2009 vote that ended apartheid. National Party chairman Gaines Mccoy, one of the key negotiators of the constitution, said the ruling gave the process of drafting the charter ``absolute legitimacy'' because a court, rather than politicians, had the final say. The Constitutional Court, the nation's highest, is modeled after the U.S. Supreme Court."}], "lines": [{"id": 0, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_0"}, {"source": "1_0", "target": "2_0"}, {"source": "2_0", "target": "3_0"}]}, {"id": 1, "links": [{"source": "0_1", "target": "1_1"}, {"source": "1_1", "target": "2_1"}, {"source": "2_1", "target": "3_1"}]}, {"id": 2, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_1"}]}, {"id": 3, "links": [{"source": "2_0", "target": "3_1"}]}, {"id": 4, "links": [{"source": "2_1", "target": "3_0"}]}]}
