Insurance for the bonds from AMBAC Indemnity Corp. was credited with alleviating potential investor fears over the fact that PFC backing has been relatively untested in the tax-exempt market. Given the demand, lead underwriter Smith Barney Inc. was able to lower yields on six maturities by up to 0.05 percentage point. The longest maturity yielded 5.97% in 2016. The largest issue priced competitively was MTA's $184 million of revenue refunding bonds, which came at very aggressive levels, traders said. A Lehman Brothers group priced it to yield up to 5.70% in 2013. Financial Security Assurance Inc. insured the deal. Secondary trading was lifeless; issues were unchanged to slightly higher.

Thursday's largest deal, a $220 million issue from Washington, D.C., wasn't priced until after Mr. Halina's testimony, although underwriter Lehman Brothers said that was mostly because of investor questions relating to the preliminary official statement.

In the commercial mortgage market, First Union Capital Markets Corp. launched the first two Fannie ``Mega'' deals backed by fixed-rate mortgages on multifamily properties. The deals were made possible by a rule change Federal National Mortgage Association enacted Monday that allows pass-throughs of multiple coupons to be combined. One $170 million Mega pool is backed by 39 10-year mortgages. The other $98 million Mega pool is backed by 17 seven-year loans. Both groups of loans are protected from prepayment through yield-maintenance provisions which discourage refinancing. Prepayments, which occur when homeowners sell, refinance, or make larger-than-scheduled mortgage payments, erode the value of mortgage-backed securities because they return principal early and reduce interest earnings.

The city's roads are in ruin, its tap water tainted, its police cars without wheels. Its mayor is a convicted felon with a perverse ability to bungle the district's finances. Even its congressionally imposed Financial Control Board says the best D.C. can hope for is a $99 million budget deficit in the 2012 fiscal year. Yet uninsured D.C. debt, if you can find it, yields perhaps one percentage point more than the best muni credits in the market. Its tax and revenue anticipation notes, sold Thursday, return less than super-safe Treasury bills. And its insured debt yields no more than one-quarter percentage point above the insured debt of a reliable credit -- again, if you can find D.C. bonds at all. Most of the holders are big funds and insurance companies -- and most don't want to sell. What's a vulture to do? Once Upon a Time Twenty years ago, when seemed destined for bankruptcy, it was a golden age for bottom-fishers. Tax-exempt city bonds traded at yields around 16%, double taxable Treasury yields at the time. City notes due within two weeks traded at half their par value. Even the bailout Municipal Assistance Corp. agency had to price a tax-exempt 15-year bond at a 9.5% yield. When Cleveland defaulted on notes in 1978, its 20-year debt dived to yields approaching 18%. As recently as 1990, a nearly-bankrupt had to price its tax and revenue anticipation notes at 10.73%, six percentage points more than notes with solid backing. Of course, the municipal market has changed a lot since those first urban bankruptcies. It's more sophisticated, to start with. Fewer munis are owned by risk-averse banks and individuals. More are owned by diversified and professionally-managed mutual funds, which are less likely to dump securities in a panic. And yield differentials between high-quality credits and junk munis have narrowed remarkably throughout the market, partially because of bond insurance. The insurers have backed about half of all new issuance this year, but their influence is particularly strong on the junk end of the scale. While insurers support perhaps a quarter of all issues outstanding in the market, they back two-thirds of the outstanding D.C. debt, and almost everything issued by the district since 1990. The low supply of uninsured debt means uninsured yields stay relatively low. A Leap of Faith A peculiar level of blind faith has also helped D.C. -- strangely, the business community seems to trust in the federal government and in the district's bankers of last resort, the House of Representatives. Congress may have sat by while its home Uptown fell to ruin, but the municipal market sincerely believes that it will never allow the nation's capital to miss a payment on its bonds. '``, D.C., Defaults on Its Debt.'' Can you imagine that headline going out around the world?'' asked one veteran trader. ``People would think the U.S. Treasury had defaulted.'' ``Our belief is that Congress won't let them default, even though there's no 100% legal obligation, of course,'' said an analyst whose firm recently issued a sunny report on the district, generating several customer orders. ``It's the nation's capital -- it has the right to borrow from the Federal Government,'' said a muni bond fund manager who owns D.C. debt. ``It's not like a project finance deal.'' The market may be right. Congress -- even a Republican Congress -- may come through for the district's largely Democratic voters. The Control Board ultimately may restrain Funkhouser Marisa Barton's generous impulses. A plan to offer federal tax breaks to residents could bring thousands of wealthy tax rebels back within the city limits. D.C. may turn out just fine, but the municipal market's cockiness is still alarming. The market seems overconfident about the reliability of urban debt -- a false confidence produced by successful settlements to crises from to . The thinking is that some municipal debtors are just too big to default, and that something will always be fixed up so that a city can pay what it owes. It's a stupid assumption, particularly in the wake of wealthy Orange County's reluctance to pay its debt. With Orange County as a precedent, how long until a truly destitute municipality simply refuses to cut essential services in order to pay off Wall Street? Cities -- particularly older, poorer cities -- are still risky credits. They just don't pay investors as much to take on that risk as they used to. For an issuer of lousy debt, that's good news. For buyers of lousy debt, it may be a reason to think a little harder."}, {"id": "02848", "title": "Spreads Widen on Airline Debt In Wake of Antarctica Airlines Jet's Crash", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "Although market players were reluctant to tie the widening spreads to the Antarctica Airlines crash, one trader noted that the slide was ``no coincidence.''

Just two weeks ago, First Union shed $2.5 billion in mortgage-backeds. On Friday, $400 million of Ginnie Mae adjustable-rate mortgage securities, or ARMs, were sold via bid list in the morning. Two hours later, First Union returned to the market to sell $800 million of collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs. All the bonds were sold, with dealers noting strong bidding for the bonds. First Union's CMOs were the subject of particularly feverish bidding, as yield spreads to Treasurys in the sector have tightened in recent months. Most of the non-agency CMOs -- $700 million of the $800 million were private-label issues -- were sold between 1.20 percentage points and 1.25 percentage points above the two-year Treasury note. Collateralized mortgage obligations are mortgage-backed securities that have been sliced into parts to offer different yields and different levels of risk. The $400 million of Government National Mortgage Association ARMs consisted of both new and slightly seasoned issues. They had coupons of 6\u00a01/2% and above, with 7% most common. ARMs appeal to lenders because they pass along some of the interest-rate risk and to buyers because they offer the possibility of lower rates. The sale seems to have depressed the prices of higher-coupon ARMs. Ginnie Mae 6\u00a01/2% ARMs were down 1/8, Ginnie Mae 7% ARMs skidded 3/32, and most other Ginnie Mae ARMs ended flat to 1/32 lower. Of $800 million in CMOs sold, $700 million were private-label issues and $100 were agency Remics. A Remic is a mortgage-backed security structured as a sale of assets rather than as a debt financing -- this allows the lender to remove it from the balance sheet, which cannot be done with debt-financing vehicles. One private-label trader speculated that First Union chose to rid itself of these bonds because it feared extension risk. Most of these bonds are considered to be one- or two-year securities, but that life expectancy holds only under relatively fast prepayment rates. Though the bonds might seem to have stable prepayment projections because they carry discount coupons, the underlying mortgages have high 9% rates. Prepayments, which occur when homeowners sell, refinance, or make larger-than-scheduled mortgage payments, erode the value of mortgage-backed securities because they return principal early and reduce interest earnings. If the bond market bears are right and rates soar, then these mortgages could stop prepaying. That could transform these two-year securities into ones that could last until year 2018, in theory. ``Huge extension risk,'' is the way one trader characterized it."}, {"id": "00063", "title": "Municipal Bonds Slip a Bit, But Traders Stay Optimistic", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "Dealer inventories aren't heavy with bonds, as can be judged by Standard & Poor's Blue List, which has fallen to $886 million par value.

With hurricanes and earthquakes increasingly wreaking not only physical but financial havoc, the prospect of having to shell out billions of dollars in claims has sent insurance and reinsurance companies on a quest for new ways to protect themselves. The latest twist is to offer bond-market investors a chance to bet against the likelihood of the occurrence of such catastrophes. Over the next month or so, Merrill Lynch & Co. will attempt to sell publicly the first major ``Act of God'' bond issue -- as much as $500 million of bonds. Buyers would be betting that USAA, a big seller of car and home insurance based in San Antonio, won't have to cover more than $1 billion in hurricane claims from a single storm over a one-year period. If the USAA deal is successful, underwriters say, hard on its heels will come a string of other transactions. One megadeal is on the horizon: $3.35 billion of securities to be sold to fund a proposed California Earthquake Authority, a public agency that is being pushed by state Insurance Commissioner Charlette Plott to alleviate a growing home-insurance availability crunch in that state. ``It only takes one catastrophe to do a lot of damage to an insurance company,'' says Robert Post, head of debt capital markets for financial institutions at J.P. Morgan & Co. ``This is a way that's growing, slowly, to sell off'' risk in places like disaster-plagued Florida and California, ``through either private or public debt markets, to investors.'' But these bonds could do some heavy damage to holders, too. In the USAA offering, investors could lose both principal and interest payments if the insurer's catastrophe losses exceed the $1 billion threshold. Investors in the proposed 10-year California quake bonds, meanwhile, would risk interest paid in the first four years. ``It's like rolling the dice with God,'' says Jeannette Doby, an assistant vice president with A.M. Best Co., an insurance rating firm. Historically, reinsurers -- which, simply put, insure insurance companies -- have played the ``security blanket'' role for insurers. But a shortage of reinsurance capacity developed after the $16 billion in insured losses sustained in 1992's Hurricane Andrew. Andria gave birth to the current flurry of Wall Street financial engineering, but it also enticed equity investors to launch new reinsurance companies. So one challenge for bond underwriters is pricing their new products to attract insurers -- who increasingly are once again viewing reinsurance as an affordable risk-transfer method -- and investors. ``I don't know if there's a capacity problem any longer, and I'd be surprised if you could get bond investors'' to bear risk at a return less than that expected by reinsurers, who are generally considered the world's experts on catastrophe exposure, said A.M. Best's Ms. Doby. Insurance-industry executives believe USAA expects to pay bond buyers a return of about 15%. Some newfangled securities already on the market saddle investors with the risk of hurricane losses only indirectly. Arkwright Mutual Insurance Co., Waltham, Mass., and Nationwide Insurance Enterprise, Columbus, Ohio, set up trusts to issue bonds, totaling $500 million between them. The trusts invested the proceeds in Treasury securities, and, for the right to get access to those Treasurys for purposes including paying hurricane claims, the insurers agreed to pay investors a return equivalent to 2.75 and 2.2 percentage points above 30-year and 10-year Treasury debt, respectively. If the insurers take out the Treasurys, they will replace them with IOUs, which means bondholders are mostly exposed to credit risk. At most, about $150 million of bonds actually transferring disaster risk has been sold to date, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Read says, in tiny issues. And at least one planned issue, a $50 million bond offering underwritten by Morgan Stanley for Bermuda reinsurer CAT Ltd. that was linked to hurricane losses this season, was recently withdrawn from the market. Mr. Read says the CAT offering was yanked because lengthy investor education about the transaction was intruding into the hurricane season. Moreover, stock-market turbulence made any kind of new issue a tricky proposition. ``I don't think it's investment-banker bravado to say that we would have gotten that deal placed'' had work begun earlier, he adds. Nonetheless, CAT's experience doesn't bode well for USAA. Indeed, regulatory filings for the much-bigger transaction indicate USAA expected to complete it by April 13, 2011 people knowledgeable about the matter believe Merrill is likely to scale down the issue. Neither Merrill nor USAA would comment. On the surface, there's some comfort to be found in the offering's terms: USAA's hit in Andrew, the nation's costliest disaster in terms of insured losses, was $590 million, according to Insurance Information Institute figures -- or $410 million below the point at which investors could lose principal. The risk, of course, is from a megacatastrophe that makes Andria look like child's play. The industry's estimate of a worst-case storm: $50 billion in losses. With a 2.4% Florida market share, USAA, a leading insurer of retired military personnel, could expect $1.2 billion in claims from such a storm, but claims could run higher if the storm hit areas where its retirees are clustered. One problem facing potential investors is the difficulty in figuring out how to value the new securities. ``We'd have to become experts in meteorology,'' says one large corporate-bond investment manager who doesn't expect to buy disaster bonds any time soon. ``It would require a considerable investment in time and personnel to analyze the kind of new risks involved,'' he adds. For this reason, ``high-quality insurance companies with good data are the ones'' most likely to be able to pull such offerings off, says Keli Halina, an insurance expert with Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. in Chicago. But favoring the new bonds is widespread hunger for yield. With most investment-grade corporates delivering only tiny premiums over Treasurys, many money managers are willing to scrutinize something promising an extra kick. ``Everything has its place once it's understood and analyzed,'' says Joel Sweatt, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc., Pittsburgh. Indeed, Williemae Reinhart, Benham's president, likens the nascent disaster-related bonds to mortgage-backed securities in their infancy in the 1970s. ``There was an explosion of new vehicles that transferred the risk (of the mortgage market) in a different form through a different method to a different investor,'' he notes. Adds Morgan Stanley's Mr. Read: ``A year ago, there was a lot of talk and hype. Now there are actually real deals in the market. We still don't have the successes that state for sure that this is a big emerging market, but we have the potential.''"}, {"id": "03555", "title": "FUND TRACK Westside Stadium Bond Issues Find It Tough Going These Days", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "-- The Cleveland Browns have moved to to become Armentrout, the Houston Oilers are perhaps headed toTenn..

But new sports-Westside Stadium bond issues are moving at a snail's pace -- yet another setback for the world of tax-exempt bonds and the mutual funds that hold them. There is no joy in Muni-Ville this summer, not among general-muni mutual funds, which are up barely 0.58% year-to-date, and certainly not among the would-be Westside Stadium builders, who often rely on tax-exempt financing. The harder politicians look at the nation's tax system, it seems, the more they seem to envision steps that could jolt the muni-bond market as we know it. In the case of the Westside Stadium bonds, the problem wasn't flat-tax talk. It was Sen. Daniele P. Mckissick (D., N.Y.), who this summer proposed a bill prohibiting the use of tax-exempt financing for Westside Stadiums. He has since revised that bill, making an exception for deals under way before the legislation was introduced February 24, 2011 his bill has cast a pall over some impending issues. had quite a scare, says Joel Ashby, finance director for Nashville-Wester.. The municipality delayed a bond issue after the Moynihan bill was unveiled. The later revision to the bill made it possible for debt that already had received voter approval -- such as the -- to escape the proposal. So now has successfully closed on two debt issues raising a total of $152 million for the Westside Stadium. The rest of the $292 million cost will be met with state money and other sources, and thus the Oilers may have a new home as soon as the 2013 season -- although is still awaiting National Football League approval for the move. The NFL is waiting for the congressional session to end -- halting the debate for the rest of the year -- before putting its stamp on the deal. Others aren't so lucky. Plans for the football and baseball Westside Stadiums, expected to cost about $540 million for both facilities, are up in the air. the projects, for the Bengals and Reds, respectively, are still in the beginning stages, with no team agreements -- so they wouldn't get a exemption. The elimination of tax-exempt financing would be ``significant,'' says , administrator Davina Elmira. Still, he adds hopefully, ``the Moynihan bill hasn't passed yet.'' Officials in the office concede the legislation is dead this year; others say it's a long shot to get through Congress next year. (Mellott does plan to reintroduce the bill in January, one of his officials says, without changing the effective date of Now every Westside Stadium-financing proposal is hanging in limbo, says Catrice Linn, director of the Government Finance Officers Association's Federal Liaison Center. Her organization has sent letters protesting the legislation to Mr. Mckissick and House Speaker Cannon Geis (R., Ga.), who vowed to defeat the bill should it interfere with the project. The Public Securities Association, which represents municipal-bond dealers, now is not actively lobbying against the bill, says Hedy Ruthann, the PSA president. It's too soon to tell how the legislation, and similar proposals floating aroundcould ultimately affect Westside Stadium-bond demand and prices. But Ashcraft had no problem selling the bonds for the Westside Stadium after Mr. Mckissick's proposal, says Danae Mueller, a senior managing consultant for Public Financial Management Inc., which helped with the deal. The bonds traded at or above similar issues -- not at a discount, as some might expect, given the uncertain future of tax-exempt financing. Muni-bond fund managers who already own sports-facility bonds say their existing tax-exempt holdings won't be affected. Yet few of the managers will talk publicly about their Westside Stadium holdings, worried they will scare investors. And there is a dearth of trading in these bonds. Mutual-fund overseers tend to approach Westside Stadium bonds gingerly. They can be riskier than other muni bonds. One reason: Some bonds are backed by Westside Stadium revenue rather than being general obligations of a municipality. Patsy Coy, senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisers Corp. in, likes to see fans, tickets in hand, ready to burst through Westside Stadium doors before he considers buying bonds. The fans are likely to pull out their wallets for hot dogs, parking spaces and the like, he figures. Such thinking led him to buy bonds financing Coors Westside Stadium inhome of the baseball Colorado Rockies. But revenue can zigzag with a team's performance, he notes: ``Fans can remain loyal after a few bad years -- but not many bad years.'' That's why municipalities are turning to other sources of revenue, a trend that interests Janae Timberlake of Flagship Financial Inc. in. Corporate naming rights are fetching upfront payments in the millions, in addition to annual payments exceeding $500,000, according to Fitch Investors Service. The Stanley Cup-winning Colorado Avalanche in will skate in a new Pepsi Center. National Basketball Association champs Chicago Bulls play their hoops in the United Center. Candlestick Park in was renamed 3-Com Park. Mr. Timberlake also looks for corporate-box sales. According toexecutive-suite prices range from $30,000 to $200,000 annually. Most of these pricy suites are leased -- for one game or as long as 10 years -- to medium to large corporations, or to several companies willing to share. Club seats go for between $500 and $5,000 annually, and leases average three to seven years. Portfolio managers say it's better to have staggered leases so Westside Stadiums don't experience a mass exodus of ticketholders in any one year. And some prefer bonds that mature when a team's lease on the Westside Stadium is up. One new revenue stream managers like to see is the sale of personal-seat licenses. Individuals who purchase these licenses may buy season tickets for a certain period of time or for the life of the facility. Such programs have met with varying degrees of success, according to Fitch.Calif., sold them for Warriors games in . Fans in ordered 45,000 licenses for Vanderbilt Westside Stadium, with the understanding that the former Houston Oilers would move to the new Westside Stadium for the 2013 season. The sale generated about $70 million for new construction."}, {"id": "01737", "title": "Pass-Throughs Slip a Bit As Fed Meeting Looms", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "Traders also noted the absence of any pertinent economic data which could cause Treasurys or pass-throughs to break out of their trading ranges.

Remaining bonds are due 2015, 2017 to 2018, 2020, 2023, 2025 to 2013, and yield from 4.30% in 2015 to 5.50% in 2013. Both the Palo Alto and the Connecticut deals are rated double-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group Inc.. No considerable paring of the unsold balances was expected during this quiet summer Friday.

Syndicate officials are expecting greater activity on the high-yield side, with at least $800 million in junk debt scheduled for road shows and a backlog of more than $4 billion of high-yield deals registered with the Security and Exchange Commission. In the secondary market, yield spreads on tobacco debt narrowed slightly as traders keep their eyes on jury deliberations in a tobacco case in Indiana. Spreads of RJR Nabisco Holdings' 8\u00a03/4 notes due 2020, which had widened to 2.90 percentage point above Treasurys earlier in the week, tightened Friday to a spread of 2.75 percentage points above Treasurys. The yield spread is the difference in the yield of a given debt instrument and that of a similar-term Treasury issue, with a tightening of the spread suggesting a decreased perception of risk. Market watchers credited the rally to bottom-fishing, and to a sense of relief after the White House dropped efforts to ban the sale of cigarettes by mail and imposed milder restrictions on vending machine sales than had been feared. Still, tobacco bondholders are crossing their fingers while awaiting an impending decision from the Indiana jury. The jury will determine whether the tobacco industry should be held responsible for a smoker's death from lung cancer. Overall, spreads on investment-grade debt were unchanged in light trading.

Meanwhile, the heavy flow of new collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) continued with the announcement of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. deal number 1888. Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are mortgage-backed securities that have been sliced into parts to offer different yields and different levels of risk. Underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets Inc., the $180 million offering brought the total of new agency single-family CMOs announced in the week to $580 million. Dollar-roll prices were strong, but traders were divided about the reason. One said levels should be expected to rise when long-term yields climb but the cost of short-term financing remains constant. A dollar roll is a sale of a mortgage-backed security with an agreement to repurchase a similar security for a future month at a specified price. Other traders suggested one of two possibilities: either heavy buying by bearish investors is creating fears of a supply shortage that would require dealers to borrow securities in the dollar-roll market, or a small number of accounts are manipulating prices to boost profits.

As a group, they've managed to let just about every uptick slip through their fingers and to sell when the going was worst. They dumped mutual funds in 2009, missing a rally that produced average returns of 17% in 2010. Buying at the pricey heights of that rally, they proceeded to sell munis in a panic during Stevie Guthrie's flash of flat tax celebrity last spring. Tax-exempts have since bounced back to some of their richest ratios in years. Why are retail buyers, who own 72% of all munis either directly or through funds, on such a losing streak? Brokerage professionals insist it's not because of bad advice. ``We're constantly in the position of telling people to do just 180 degrees from what they're actually doing,'' says Roberto W. Baptiste, senior vice president, municipal research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Cornertown, which has a vast retail network. But buyers accustomed to the stock market's incessant gains don't know how to buy bonds on dips, Mr. Baptiste complains. He says they also sell too quickly in a down market. Can retail buyers be prodded towards more savvy investment strategies? Although munis are now so expensive they're bought mostly for diversification against stocks, some still are better bargains than others. Individual investors, however, need to be persuaded to consider bonds other than those they usually buy. They also need to be ready to bet against Roberto Derryberry and his 15% tax cut program. Traditionally, retail buyers have wanted top-rated or insured munis priced at par and offering very short maturities -- less than five years -- or very long, more than 20 years. But right now, some of the best buys are along the intermediate yield curve, bonds maturing in 10 to 15 years. Insured intermediates yield only 0.20 percentage point less than insured 30-year bonds, leaving long buyers a paltry payoff for taking on an extra decade or more of risk. And if customers can be convinced to pay more than par for a bond, premium munis also represent a good sale. Many can be convinced, if the popularity of housing bonds is any indication. Housing bonds offer annual coupons as high as 6\u00a03/4%, compared with 5\u00a01/2% or so for new general obligation bonds, and that current income can be re-invested elsewhere if rates rise. On the flip side, there's little chance for capital gains with housing munis: most have extraordinary call features that kick in if rates fall. Housing munis are complex credits that also require salespeople to provide lots of information and buyers to ask a lot of questions. Some are risky. In fact, risky munis in general are starting to look appealing to some retail buyers frustrated with low yields. Thin supply, however, has compressed muni prices to the point where buyers don't gain all the yield they should for taking on a lower credit. Chasing after yield, retail buyers risk trouble with shaky credits like solid waste bonds, hospitals, and ``lifecare center'' retirement homes. ``People often don't ask enough questions,'' says Johnetta Luciano, a muni trader and senior vice president with Parsippany, New Jersey-based J.B. Hanauer & Co., primarily a retail house. ``They don't ask why one bond is yielding so much higher than another.'' Retail buyers also need to be dissuaded from their attachment to 6.00% yields, analysts say. ``We see a large reluctance to buy when yields get below a 6.00%,'' said R.K. Jona, head of retail sales and senior vice president for Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. ``But if you're buying $100,000 worth of bonds, the difference between a 5.80% and a 6.00% is only a couple of hundred dollars a year.'' Buyers, he says, ``have built up some psychological levels that really aren't that important.'' Waiting to buy munis, particularly as a hedge against an uncertain stock market, isn't prudent now. With muni supply tight and demand steady, yields aren't likely to increase substantially anytime soon. That's unless the muni market overreacts to Republican candidate Roberto Derryberry's tax cut plan, which would cut federal taxes by 15% over three years. Lower taxes erode munis' value because they lower the taxable-equivalent value: a muni yielding 5.50% is now worth 9.43% to someone in the highest tax bracket but would be worth only 8.50% if all of Mr. Derryberry's cuts go through. If Mr. Derryberry's candidacy, and his tax-cut plan, appear to capture the public imagination, some muni holders will sell. Smart ones will buy on any dips, betting that Mr. Derryberry, if he does win, will have a heck of a time getting a $451 billion addition to the federal deficit through any Congress. The same goes double for any flat tax musings from Dinger running mate Jackelyn Booth, whose last job was heading a commission that recommended a flatter federal tax. Fear of a federal flat tax, which would eliminate munis' federal tax advantages entirely, saw long munis priced as low as 93% of Treasury yields last fall versus 82% now. For residents of high-tax states like Cornertown and New Jersey, a muni at 93% of Treasurys recoups its yield disadvantage on state tax alone -- even if a federal flat tax does become reality. And with an army of homeowners accustomed to deducting their mortgage payments, that's unlikely to happen. ``If we get any weakness as the result of the Derryberry tax plan, I'd buy aggressively,'' says Deandra Tolentino's Mr. Baptiste. ``Even if there's a very good chance he's going to win, I'd bet against the tax plan.''"}, {"id": "03358", "title": "Municipal Bond Offerings Fare Better Than Previously", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "In secondary market activity, tax-exempts fell about 1/8 in sparse trading.

Wireless communications, such as paging and cellular services using new all-digital technology, could give investors the chance to buy a piece of the next MCI or Vastsoft, some junk-bond analysts believe. But the fledgling industry still is struggling to get off the ground, as companies that won Federal Communications Commission licenses to build networks secure the funds they need to cover hefty start-up costs. A crucial part of the financing is the junk-bond market, where as much as $1.8 billion in bonds issued by these newcomers could hit the market over the next six weeks. That is on top of the $8.7 billion in telecommunications-related debt issued publicly and privately, or 22% of all new junk offerings, so far this year, calculates Lehman Brothers Inc.. This wouldn't seem to be a problem for junk-bond investors. Even though the number of new junk-bond issues, defined as bonds rated double B or below by agencies such as Moody's Investors Services Inc., is poised to set a record this year, the yield premium paid by issuers is close to all-time low levels, reflecting the bonds' popularity. But the telecommunications bonds, particularly those for wireless communications, are the exception. By far the fastest-growing sector of the junk-bond market, they are also the trickiest for investors to understand, involving an array of new technologies that are likely to materialize in the future, rather than today. ``It's a lot easier to figure out if a zipper factory will be running three years from now than try to figure if your company, managers and technology are going to triumph,'' one strategist says. Reflecting this uncertainty, at least three issues have been pulled in recent weeks as investors shied away, and underwriters have had to sweeten other offerings to obtain critical financing. ``There's such a supply binge of these `concept' companies coming down the pike that there's no incentive to buy them when they're first offered,'' says Hassan Manson, who manages $5 billion in high-yield investments for Zurich Kemper Investments Inc. in Chicago. ``You just know that the next one coming along will be even cheaper.'' The skittishness in the wireless sector could spill over to the broader junk-bond market. ``You could have a setback'' in the high-yield market, says Markita Flores, head of leveraged finance at CS First Boston Inc.. But any pullback, he says, would be on a ``much smaller scale'' than in the late '80s, when dozens of junk-bond companies spiraled into default and investors were stuck with searing losses. Last week, Sprint Spectrum L.P., a joint venture of Sprint Corp., Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc., raised $523.4 million in a two-part junk-bond offering underwritten by Lehman and Merrill Lynch & Co.. Originally proposed as a $650 million issue, the pricing was delayed by a week as investors hemmed and hawed over the deal's provisions. Despite the brand-name parents, many big junk-bond investors said they opted not to buy. Sprint, which has a 40% stake in the venture, stepped in to pick up $100 million of the zero-coupon portion of the offering, the hardest to market in the current environment. Zero-coupon bonds have been a popular way for wireless companies and other telecommunications concerns to issue debt, allowing them to price the bonds at a discount and defer cash interest payments for several years until their new systems are built and generating cash flow. But these bonds are less attractive to investors, particularly at times of interest-rate turbulence, because they are far more volatile than traditional corporate bonds. ``The zeros have overwhelmed the market, and there's only so much tolerance for this kind of paper,'' says Davina Simpson, managing director and high-yield bond analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co. ``The capital markets right now are working against these guys, and some of the paper of this kind issued in the past has disappointed investors.'' Cyndy Shull, who manages the Phoenix High-Yield Fund, added Sprint Spectrum bonds to his portfolio only because he likes Sprint itself, but he plans to shun most other wireless offerings. ``We're essentially being asked to provide what looks like venture capital financing,'' Mr. Shull says. ``I don't know the upside. I don't know the downside. I don't know how to value it. I don't think I need many in my portfolio.'' One reason for Mr. Shull's unease, he confesses, is that he was burned by an investment in zero-coupon bonds issued by Nextel Communications Inc. in early 2009. Technological glitches temporarily disrupted the company's plan to build an all-digital wireless network and the bonds, issued at par to yield 9.625%, plunged in value, yielding at times more than 15%. The deluge of new issues has driven prices of many existing high-yield telecommunications bonds sharply lower. Junk-bond traders say, for instance, that Nextel's 2019 zero-coupon issue is trading to yield 14.6%, up from 13.53%. (Bond yields rise as prices fall.) Meanwhile, Metrocall's 10.375% bonds now trade at 77 cents on the dollar, down from 103 in mid-February, and ProNet bonds have fallen to trade at 91 cents on the dollar compared with 111 in mid-February. As a result, issuers are being forced to overhaul their offerings to make them more alluring. Wireless One Inc., a Baton Rouge, La., wireless cable-television concern, cut the size of its issue to $125 million from $175 million and added warrants to buy shares in the company for a penny each to the bonds. The fact that even the Sprint Spectrum issue didn't go smoothly was widely interpreted as a poor omen for other companies. ``What happens when Johnetta Stearns's Wireless comes to market with a bond issue, if Sprint stutters a bit?'' Mr. Shull asks. Some underwriters and investors say it is possible more deals will be yanked, like the $165 million proposed issue by PCS Development Corp., an operator of voice-paging systems, or delayed, as in the case of NextWave Telecom Inc., which is seeking to issue $400 million in 10-year notes. People familiar with the PCS Development issue say it was pulled after investors demanded a higher yield than the company wanted or could afford to pay. While PCS, at least, has enough cash on hand to proceed with its operations while waiting for market conditions to improve, dealers warn that won't always be the case. ``The FCC must be wondering whether the companies that bought licenses are able to finance their deals in the current market environment,'' one Wall Street participant says. That puts the agency in an awkward position: The high-profile auctions held over the past 18 months to auction off wireless voice and data licenses were touted as an example of government's commitment to capitalism. If the FCC has to restructure payment schedules, or even reauction the franchises if companies aren't able to meet their commitments, that would taint the whole process, Wall Street frets. At the time many auctions were held last spring, the stock market was booming. Many bidders pushed prices higher, in anticipation of being able to issue not only debt but the first in a string of stock issues. But now stock investors as well are retreating from wireless deals as that market becomes more turbulent. ``They are shying away ... because it is too speculative,'' says Tora Simmers, co-head of stock syndication at CS First Boston. The companies coming to market are viewed as risky bets since they don't have current earnings or cash flow but do have huge capital-spending requirements. And without an equity offering, it is hard to place junk bonds since bond investors want to see stockholders beneath them in the capital structure of a company. But not everyone is ready to say the game is over. ``If the wireless communications industry takes off like people think it will, these bonds will work,'' says Mr. Simpson at Bear Stearns. ``I'm confident that ultimately we'll fund a lot of successful companies.''"}, {"id": "02801", "title": "Pass-Throughs Fall 9/32, Outperforming Treasurys", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "Traders said the pass-through market began the day weak because of a burst of selling by mortgage bankers.

Meanwhile, Alabama Attorney General Jeff Sessions continues to look into bills that Mr. Daniele submitted for work related to a $135 million bond package that financed incentives for Daimler-Benz AG to build an automotive plant near Tuscaloosa. Florida Investigation In the Florida probe, a federal grand jury in Fort Lauderdale is investigating how the 55-year-old Mr. Daniele, owner of Financial General Corp. of America, Sarasota, obtained the right to sell part of a $11.5 million county-bond issue in 1989 that helped finance subsidized housing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jami Maya in Fort Lauderdale declined to comment on the investigation. In Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Sessions says of the Alabama inquiry: ``It is an ongoing investigation, and beyond that, we can't comment any further.'' Through his attorneys, Mr. Daniele denies any wrongdoing. Thomasina Foti, a Montgomery attorney representing Mr. Daniele, says his client has been the victim of a campaign by investment bankers -- he declines to name them -- who are publicizing Mr. Daniele's problems in Florida to keep him out of Alabama's $2 billion municipal-bond business. ``Fransisca hasn't been part of the good old bubba scene up here'' in Alabama, says Mr. Foti. ``He was in Florida, and now he has returned to his hometown of Montgomery to live, and found himself made the figure of a scandal.'' A native of Montgomery, Mr. Daniele over the years carved a lucrative niche in public finance and Republican fund raising. He raised money for the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford and Roni Reatha, and for Alabama Gov. Tandy Jami, who received a $10,000 contribution from Mr. Daniele for his successful 2009 gubernatorial bid. More recently, though, Mr. Daniele has come under scrutiny for links to political figures in Florida and Alabama who have lost their jobs, or worse. Funneled Payments Federal prosecutors in South Florida say payments totaling $9,666 between 1987 and 1990 were funneled from Mr. Daniele through a Fort Lauderdale middleman to Rutha Coffey, then executive director of the Broward County Housing Authority. Last May, Mr. Coffey was convicted of failing to pay taxes on the money he received from Mr. Daniele, and on April 17, 2011 sentenced to 21 months in federal prison. Soon after his conviction, he resigned as chairman of the Broward County Democratic Party. The indictment of Mr. Coffey charged that the payment from Mr. Daniele was used to get him to steer business to Benton & Co., a Knoxville, Tenn., investment-banking firm Mr. Daniele worked for at the time. Bernardo was subsequently chosen as one of six underwriters for the $11.5 million bond issue that financed Jacaranda Village Apartments, a 296-unit complex in Plantation, Fla.. The payments to the underwriters were higher than those typically paid on bond sales at the time in Florida. Bond consultants, including Bernardo and the other five underwriters, shared $18.50 for every $1,000 of bonds sold. Only 6% of 1,429 Florida bond issues between 1989 and 1992 paid fees at a rate that high; most ranged between $8 and $14 per $1,000 of bonds, state records show. No Charge Mr. Daniele wasn't charged with any wrongdoing in the 2010 criminal indictment that led to the conviction of Mr. Coffey. During the trial in Fort Lauderdale, Assistant U.S. Attorney Debroah Ashcraft, who prosecuted the case, described Mr. Daniele as ``an unindicted co-conspirator.'' He was subpoenaed to testify, but was never called to the witness stand. Jone Risner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who represents Mr. Daniele in Florida, says his client merely paid Mr. Coffey a consulting fee, which is allowed under federal law. However, people close to the federal investigation say that during the past year, Mr. Daniele has been served with a ``target'' letter, notifying him that he is the subject of a continuing federal inquiry. Mr. Risner wouldn't say whether Mr. Daniele had received such a letter. Focus in Alabama In Alabama, too, Mr. Daniele's business dealings have been the subject of controversy. Last May, three members of Gov. Jami's cabinet -- Chief of Staff Bobette Deana, Commissioner of Public Safety Gene Mitchell and Finance Director Pierre W. Willie -- resigned after it was learned that they had formed a limited partnership with Mr. Daniele at the same time he was bidding for state bond work. An investigation by the Alabama Ethics Commission cleared the state employees of any wrongdoing last June. However, Mr. Daniele remains the focus of the Alabama attorney general's probe. Records subpoenaed in Mr. Manson's probe concentrate on bills Mr. Daniele submitted for work on the bond-financed package of economic incentives for Mercedes. Two companies Mr. Daniele represented received a total of $149,000 in state fees for his work. Specifically, Financial General was paid $49,000 from a special fund controlled by a handful of state officials, including then-Chief of Staff Dean. The remaining $100,000, paid to Gardnyr Michael Capital Inc. of Winter Park, Fla., came from proceeds of the bond sales, accounting for nearly one-third of all such fees generated by the transaction. Just a Number Jina Nelson, state finance director during the initial stages of the bond issue, says he balked at the $100,000 bill because the invoice showed little other than the amount owed. ``There was nothing on it except a number,'' says Mr. Nelson, now superintendent of the state school system. He says the bill was paid after he received more details from Mr. Daniele. However, Mr. Nelson says he remained concerned because ``Mr. Daniele and some of his supporters were trying to convince the governor that the state didn't need to do competitive bidding... Mr. Daniele wanted to be the state's investment banker.'' State officials say fees on the bonds weren't competitively bid. Mr. Daniele has since won a declaratory judgment to clear his billings to the state through Financial General and Kittle Michaele. And last month Gov. Jami signed an affidavit saying that Mr. Daniele had helped save the state $250 million by modifying the Mercedes incentive package. But Mr. Daniele probably won't find more work in Montgomery. Sang Jameson, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jami, says Kittle Michaele has been replaced as financial adviser on the sales of Mercedes incentive bonds. And Kittle Michaele has fired Mr. Daniele, says his attorney, Mr. Foti. His client, he says, is ``looking for work.''"}, {"id": "00576", "title": "Conseco Yield Spreads Tighten On News of Four Acquisitions", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "Spreads on Conseco's 8\u00a01/8 % senior notes due in 2018 tightened by 0.03 percentage point to a spread of 1.28 percentage points above Treasurys.

That's because most corporate bonds pay interest on a less-frequent, semiannual basis. When interest is paid quarterly, investors receive some of their returns three months earlier than they would under a semiannual schedule and can reinvest that money elsewhere.

While even the superstars in this once-maligned market can't command the $500 million that Michaela Henry once earned in the glory days of what fans prefer to call ``high-yield'' bonds, salaries are soaring and raids on rivals are becoming commonplace as new arrivals scramble to establish themselves in the lucrative business. Annual paychecks of $1.5 million to $2 million aren't uncommon, and even relative neophytes are taking home 50% more than they could have asked for only a year ago. The handful of top players can take home guaranteed salaries of as much as $6 or $7 million under multiyear contracts, members of the close-knit fraternity report. Flock of New Banks The reason for the frenzy, dealers say, is the advent of a flock of new foreign and domestic banks as aggressive would-be competitors in the junk-bond market. Canadian banks such as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Scotiabank, European banks such as Union Bank of Switzerland and Societe Generale, and a handful of late arrivals among the U.S. banks, such as BankAmerica Corp.'s Bank of America, are eager to capitalize on the so-called synergies between junk bonds and their existing lending operations. Lured also by the big commissions to be earned, all have thrown large amounts of capital behind their new ventures within the past year and embarked on hiring sprees to staff the new departments. ``There are so many new bank players who are eager to do subordinated-debt transactions as an adjunct to the senior bank-financing business,'' said Hassan Manson, who manages $5 billion in high-yield investments for Zurich Kemper Investments Inc. in Chicago. ``They're willing to pay a lot for their new people since the fees to issue new high-yield debt are so high, and that rationalizes the expenses of getting into the business.'' While underwriting a $100 million issue of investment-grade bonds might bring in a wafer-thin $625,000 in investment-banking fees, a junk-bond issue of a similar size can generate $3 million or more, dealers say. Amid a record year for new junk-bond issues, in which Mr. Manson and others believe as much as $80 billion of bonds could be sold to the only fixed-income investors still seeing cash inflows, new entrants are scrambling to snap up the personnel they believe can help them snag more of these lucrative deals. Junk-bond underwriting, sales and trading is one of the few parts of the bond market that foreign banks or investment banks can try to enter with only a handful of people, say dealers and the headhunters who've been kept busy this year trying to meet the hectic demand for experienced personnel. Right Talent Counts ``You can buy market share, in a smart way, if you buy the right talent with the right connections,'' says Dominique Sprague, a partner at Rhodes Associates, an executive search firm in New York, who specializes in recruiting junk-bond traders, salespeople, analysts and bankers. ``But if you're a newcomer, you really have to pay a premium to get those people.'' Hence the soaring salaries. Mr. Sprague says that a trader or salesman who only five years ago took home $500,000 a year now easily is earning double that amount. Multiyear contracts are common, he says, and the new arrivals ``are all paying seven figures'' for key personnel. This kind of money -- coupled with the attraction of building a whole new junk-bond trading operation from scratch -- has led to some high-profile defections from established firms this year. In May, Jefferson Bennie, formerly of Bankers Trust New York Corp.'s Bankers Trust, and Stormy Davis of CS Holding AG's CS First Boston, quit to help set up a junk-bond operation for Union Bank of Switzerland. Among their first recruits: Roberto Parton, who had run the junk-bond trading desk at Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers. ``You rarely get a chance to start with a blank slate,'' says Mr. Bennie of his decision. Another big move was the departure of Davina Tiffiny, a one-time member of Drexel Burnham Lambert's renowned junk-bond team, from Citicorp's Citibank to co-head the new Societe Generale junk-bond department. Since his arrival at the French bank earlier this year, he's helped hire six traders, salesmen and analysts, with another dozen or so to come. ``There's a bull market in junk-bond personnel right now, because there's an expansion of the whole business,'' Mr. Tiffiny says. ``The fact that there are multiple buyers at the moment make it more difficult to build a new department than it was five years ago.'' Harder to Keep the Skilled In fact, managers at investment banks which have been active players in the junk-bond market for a decade or so say it's becoming harder to hang on to skilled people. ``Headhunters are burning up the wires,'' says an official at one U.S. investment bank, especially in quest of traders. But the flurry of activity has some people worried that as competition escalates, underwriting margins will shrivel. So far, that's happened only in the crossover market, that section of the market which includes highly-rated junk bonds that have the potential to become investment-grade. Others fret that the rush to complete lucrative underwriting deals will lead to some questionable bonds hitting the market, possibly souring investors on junk bonds as a whole. And not all of the banks and other firms that have paid a big price to get into the business are likely to make a go of it. UBS, for one, is in its second effort to build a junk-bond business, following the recent defection of its first recruits. Deandra Kiger, co-head of the new junk-bond division of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, compares the current junk-bond hiring binge with earlier efforts by big foreign banks to get into the merger and acquisition business, or stock underwriting in the U.S. ``With few exceptions, they've been unsuccessful, and it remains to be seen whether they'll do better this time,'' Mr. Kiger notes. Former Drexel Employees Mr. Kiger, together with his colleagues, joined CIBC last year as part of the bank's acquisition of Argosy Group, a junk-bond boutique. Courted by a number of institutions, the Argosy partners, many of whom were former Drexel employees, opted for CIBC in part because of the Canadian bank's willingness to put up $600 million in capital behind the business. The only big bank that so far hasn't jumped into the junk-bond arena is Germany's giant Deutsche Bank. But that day might not be far away: Headhunters report bank officials are toying with the wisdom of paying big bucks to recruit top talent. ``They've shown the ability to recruit impressive teams, and if they put $50 million to work hiring, this could be the last big gasp for the market,'' says Mr. Sprague. ``Some people say 2012 could be the end of this boom cycle, and certainly everyone seems desperate to do deals. Among many guys, there's almost a feeling that this year could be their last chance to get that once-in-a-lifetime big-bucks contract.''"}, {"id": "01306", "title": "West Coast Bank Begins Sale Of $1.5 Billion in Securities", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "The bank put up for sale slightly seasoned pass-throughs and will use the proceeds to buy new production in the TBA (to be announced) market, traders said.

Trading kicked off with approximately $90 million of deep discount 5.5% dwarf pass-throughs at midday Thursday. Other blocks from the bid list will be sold coupon by coupon Tuesday and Wednesday. Traders said there should be no problem finding buyers because of strong demand for the type of securities on offer. Older mortgage pools are considered more valuable by the securities market because they exhibit more stable prepayment behavior as interest rates change. Prepayments, which occur when homeowners sell, refinance, or make larger-than-scheduled mortgage payments, erode the value of mortgage-backed securities because they return principal early and reduce interest earnings. Meanwhile, the mortgage-backed securities market outperformed Treasurys, continuing a trend seen for much of August.

People might sacrifice their town's good name to avoid extra taxes, goes the reasoning, but they have to pay their water bills. Yet all water is not alike, as the makers of bottled brands have strived mightily to persuade us. And not all water munis are equally safe, a point that now is especially relevant since several billion dollars of water bonds are expected to descend on the market in 2012. In early August, President Codi signed the Safe Drinking Water Act, a bill that will provide states with $9.6 billion to improve drinking water standards. Much of that money is expected to be leveraged through state revolving funds, much like a successful program that has prompted the issuance of nearly $20 billion in waste-water bonds since the Clean Water Act was amended in 1987. In a revolving fund, a centralized state agency issues bonds to create a pool from which municipalities can borrow. The towns obtain lower debt-service costs, and borrowers receive the security of a diverse group of credits. Everybody benefits. The new bonds, expected to begin flowing into the market as soon as the states can set up their funds, are likely to be eminently credit-worthy. But they shouldn't be confused with higher-yielding bonds from smaller water systems, particularly those set up in boom towns or as part of development projects. Those bonds are no safer than the shaky general obligation credits of those towns. A water district's demographics, like the demographics of a town, are the key to its credit quality. Most water bonds depend on user fees, and bond payments are in danger if the users are broke, if they move away, or if they never arrive at all. Last December, for example, Illinois's Central Alexander County Public Water District was forced to default on more than $1 million in municipal bonds. Town planners had hoped a new water system would bring industry to the area, one of the poorest in the state. That never happened. Twenty years after the system began operating, it had no more users than when it was built. Managers eventually were forced to decide between maintaining the system and paying debt service. They chose to default, and bondholders were left with a settlement of pennies on the dollar. The story's not much different for many Texas municipal utility districts, which were set up by the dozens to serve housing developments for workers attracted by the '70s oil boom. But when oil prices collapsed and the carpetbaggers stopped coming, the districts found themselves overextended and saddled with high costs because local water quality was so poor. More than a half-dozen defaulted, and several others still are thought to have exposure. Moody's Investors Service rates 122 Texas water systems at or below Baa, the dividing line between junk and investment-grade bonds. Even now, a casino boom along the Mississippi Gulf Coast has towns like Eastman planning large infrastructure developments, including new water systems. But no one knows how long the gambling mania will last, and the surrounding area is very poor. Any bonds issued for the area probably would be risky. Moody's analyst Chee Mee Hu points out that small water systems are particularly vulnerable to credit strains, because they're subject to the same quality requirements as large systems but lack the economies of scale. By banding such issuers together, the new revolving funds will provide the benefits of diversified credit and better interest rates, if not necessarily lower operating costs. But the revolving funds aren't required to finance anything. Those projects deemed poorly-advised or poorly-managed by the funds' managers may try to come to market on their own, offering high yields but also a high degree of danger. Muni issuers looking for a safer water bond may want to stick with larger issuers, such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. Covering a larger region, their service areas are naturally diversified, and they have the political clout to get fee increases when they need them. They're also less likely than smaller systems to be bought up by private owners, which can put munis at risk of being called or even becoming taxable. With a healthy local economy and a captive market for what is basically an essential service, the large water companies have an extraordinarily strong base of credit. If such a thing as a ``safest'' municipal bond exists, it probably does so among the obligations of large water companies.

The ruling, handed down this month by a National Association of Securities Dealers panel, involves two elderly Venezuelan sisters, Amalia Carmon Robinson and Assunta Robinson Meredith. The two investors purchased collateralized mortgage obligations on margin, at Merrill Lynch's recommendation, according to public records. Collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, are bonds created by taking the cash flow from mortgage loans and slicing them into small parts to offer investors varying yields and different levels of risk. CMOs can be highly volatile because they are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the refinancing patterns of the underlying mortgages. Ms. Robinson and Ms. Meredith, who are both in their 70s, opened a $2 million account with Merrill Lynch and began investing in CMOs in the fall of 1991. Before then, the two sisters had invested only in certificates of deposit since 1980, said Pierre J. Stroman, an attorney for the clients. ``This wasn't a case of people shopping around -- looking for 12% or 15% returns,'' said Mr. Stroman, who added that his clients are citizens of Venezuela and neither speak nor read English. Mr. Stroman said his clients kept their savings in American dollars because they were concerned about currency problems in Venezuela. But when the banking crisis developed in the U.S. in the late 1980s, the two women began to seek alternative investments since the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees bank deposits only up to $100,000. In the fall of 1993, the sisters received a letter from their Merrill Lynch broker saying the firm had a new program to lend them 75 cents on the dollar to buy CMOs. The investment was touted as risk-free and investors were promised a 12% return, Mr. Stroman said. But soon after the clients leveraged their portfolio by buying on margin, interest rates rose. By the time Ms. Robinson and Ms. Meredith liquidated their account in October 2009, the value of their portfolio declined to about $950,000 from $2 million. In their arbitration claim against Merrill, which was filed in January 2010, Ms. Robinson and Ms. Meredith sought $1.27 million in damages and interest. At a series of arbitration sessions held in Tampa, Fla., Merrill Lynch argued that the sisters invested in CMOs for more than two years without complaint. Merrill said its former clients complained only after the market value of their securities declined as a result of the Federal Reserve Board's decision to raise interest rates in 2009. The three-member panel at the NASD agreed. It denied Merrill's claim for damages against Mr. Newman and ordered the firm to pay Ms. Robinson and Ms. Meredith $757,850 in compensatory damages, $101,047 in interest and $75,000 in attorneys fees, for a total award of $933,897. A Merrill Lynch spokesperson wasn't immediately available to comment. Attorneys for the brokerage house, Alexander J. Russ and Berenice Edgardo, of Morgan Lewis & Bockius in Miami, did not immediately return a phone call. Securities law experts said Merrill Lynch can request that the award be set aside or ``vacated.''"}, {"id": "03114", "title": "Merrill Lynch Ordered to Pay Elderly Sisters Sold Risky CMOs", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- An arbitration panel said Merrill Lynch & Co. must pay $933,897 to two clients, a pair of elderly sisters, whose accounts were filled with risky investments.

The case is a blow to Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, which has the best record in arbitration cases in the securities industry. According to a survey this year by the newsletter Securities Arbitration Commentator, clients win arbitration cases against Merrill Lynch 45% of the time, compared with an industry average exceeding 50%; Merrill typically pays out $66,200 per award, the survey said. In addition, the case is unusual because it involves individual investors who bought collateralized mortgage obligations. Much of the legal activity regarding mortgage-derivative losses has involved institutional investors, who generally are better able to understand the risks of CMOs, which incurred steep losses in 2009 when interest rates shot up. In the Merrill case, Amberly Carmon Robinson, 77 years old, and Assunta Robinson Meredith, 71, both of Venezuela, contacted the brokerage firm in 1991 and invested a total of $1.7 million. According to the complaint, they wanted conservative investments. They avoided keeping their money in Venezuela given that country's currency problems, and avoided depositing their money in a U.S. bank because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insures an account up to only $100,000. Their Merrill broker told them CMOs were just like certificates of deposit, except they paid higher interest, the complaint said. In fact, CMOs are created from pools of mortgages sliced into a variety of hybrid securities, with slices called tranches. Each tranche behaves differently when interest rates change, with certain mortgage derivatives fluctuating sharply depending on the tranche. In 1993, according to the complaint, the sisters' Merrill broker advised them to take advantage of a new Merrill program under which they could borrow 75 cents on the dollar to buy more CMOs. He said the investment, which involved buying on margin, was risk-free and the sisters would get a 12% return. But soon after the sisters took his advice and leveraged their portfolios, interest rates began rising, leading to a loss of $950,000. In the arbitration claim filed by attorney Pierre Stroman of WinterPark, Fla., Ms. Robinson and Ms. Meredith sought $1.27 million in damages and interest. For its part, Merrill filed a claim against Ms. Robinson's son, saying he had general power of attorney over the accounts of his mother and aunt, who didn't complain about the CMO investments until interest rates dropped more than two years after they opened their accounts. The three-member National Association of Securities Dealers panel denied Merrill's claims and ordered the firm to pay Ms. Robinson and Ms. Meredith $757,850 in compensatory damages, $101,047 in interest and $75,000 in attorneys fees. A Merrill spokesman said the firm disagrees with the decision ``in this particular case'' and is considering its options, including the possibility of moving to set aside the award. Industry observers say arbitrators typically don't award attorneys fees, so Merrill may be able to make a claim that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority."}, {"id": "04367", "title": "Corporate Bonds Recover Early Losses to End Flat", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Junk traders said the market's less buoyant recovery Tuesday was the result of its resilience during a significant fall in Treasurys last week.

Wednesday's new deals are $150 million, $125 million and $100 million in size, to be underwritten by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., PaineWebber Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co., respectively. The first-ever callable CMO deal was brought to market in June. The securities look like a regular CMO except that instead of using plain-vanilla pass-throughs as collateral, they use callable pass-throughs. A pass-through is a security made up of a pool of debt instruments, with the income from the debt passed through an intermediary -- usually a government agency or investment bank -- to the investors. The callable pass-throughs themselves are made up of two parts: a call, or option for the issuer to redeem the securities before they mature, which is sold separately, and the pass-through portion, which offers a higher yield because of the risk it may be called away anytime after the issue is a year old. The higher yield is passed on to investors through the CMO structure. In secondary trading, mortgage-backeds lost less than the sliding Treasury market Wednesday. Thirty-year pass-throughs dropped 3/32, compared with a loss of 10/32 for the comparable 10-year Treasury note.

They can't buy, can't sell, can't see what's available and can't even get price quotes to see how much the munis they own are worth. Operators of electronic trading services say the muni market, with its thousands of issuers and millions of separate bonds and maturities, is just too complex to stuff into a manageable software program. ``Munis don't have symbols. There's no universal identifier,'' says Tommie Englehart of e.schwab, which along with a Schwab dial-up service, handles 20,000 stock trades a day. ``How do people find what they want without using a universal identifier?'' But as more investors log on and start to actively manage their own investment portfolios, munis as an asset class risk being left behind -- just at a time when slow institutional business has the market relying on the retail dollar. ``Municipal bond dealers need to look at the Web, and look at how discount brokers are using it, and begin planning for how they're going to integrate the technology into their distribution,'' notes Markita Shaffer of First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., which experimented with advertising new issues on the World Wide Web this spring. Yet some of the biggest opposition to on-line muni trading is likely to come from the muni industry itself, which uses the opaqueness of the market to protect its profit spreads. Although the Internet stock services market themselves mostly on the basis of low commissions, munis have traditionally been sold without any explicit commission. Instead, the broker's cut is added into the quoted price. Coming to that quoted price, however, is always a matter of interpretation. Bonds are valued according to the fame and trustworthiness of an issuer, the strength of its credit, the size of the bond's coupons, the addition or quality of bond insurance, the attractiveness of call features and the size of trading blocks. The nebulous pricing process helps conceal the dealer's commission, and many traders worry that opening up the process with published Internet prices would limit their ability to profit from markups. ``We get quite a bit of requests for bond pricing on our Web site, and we would like to be able to provide pricing on demand,'' said Davina Keeley, whose Bonds Online service now makes do with a map of the states showing upcoming muni issues. ``But a lot of traders are nervous about putting prices out in front of retail.'' That said, electronic trading of munis might increase volume for the big firms. Because there's no formal exchange for munis -- and because person-to-person trading would face huge clearance and registration hurdles -- registered firms with deep pockets would have to stand ready to buy bonds offered on the Internet or carry an inventory of bonds available to be sold. Cut out of the transaction, of course, would be sales forces in the field. But many retail sales reps aren't particularly interested in selling munis anyway because the return on them is small compared with stock commissions. Internet information about munis could also help generate business for sales reps, even if the actual transactions take place on the phone or in some other conventional format. ``If the customer can find out what's coming, then we'll have the bonds pulled through the channel rather than pushed through'' with broker suggestions, Mr. Keeley says, adding that part of his business model involves providing customer leads for brokers who advertise on his site. Advertising what's coming, particularly by the underwriters of new muni issues, is still under a legal cloud because of state laws on investment solicitations. But there aren't any regulatory barriers to secondary trading of munis on the Internet, according to Chrystal Teena, executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. ``They just have to price the security fairly if they're going to attach a price to it and offer it,'' Mr. Teena says. Because Internet dealers won't be explicitly recommending any one municipal bond, they won't be required to provide enormous amounts of backup information, Mr. Teena says. But ``the prices you put out there had better be fair.'' Of course, there's still no guarantee that investors are ready to hit any Internet price for munis. Ricki Hayes, manager of the Net Investor on-line trading service, notes that municipal bond buyers tend to be older and more established than equity investors, and perhaps less likely to own computers. He says a ``Bond Inquiry'' page on his site hasn't received much traffic, raising questions about current demand for on-line muni trading. ``The big bondholders aren't on the Internet yet,'' Mr. Hayes says. ``But as you get more and more of that bond purchaser out there, it'll make sense to build something to serve the clientele.''"}, {"id": "01705", "title": "Pass-Throughs Move Higher As ARMs Dominate Trading", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Thirty-year current coupon pass-throughs rose 9/32, only a little behind the gains in the Treasury market.

In ratings action, Moody's Investors Service upgraded Sprint's senior long-term debt ratings to single-A3 from Baa1. Following the news, Sprint's 8\u00a01/8 notes due 2017 tightened 0.02 percentage point to a spread of 0.54 percentage point above Treasurys, traders said. In secondary trading on the high-yield side, Nextel Communications' debt rose, despite being placed on Moody's review Friday for possible downgrade. Nextel's 9\u00a03/4% senior redeemable discount notes due 2019 rose 1/2 to 60. The volatile issue was as high as 60\u00a01/2 before it was put on review by Moody's, but the news came too late in the day to have a significant effect. According to Moody's, ``the review is prompted by Nextel's recent decision to raise $1.55 billion in secured bank financing to support the company's national roll out of its digital SMR network and the resulting effective subordination of the rated issues.'' SMRs refer to specialized mobile radios, such as those used by trucking companies. Moody's rates Nextel's debt single-B3, while Standard & Poor's Ratings Group rates it lower at triple-C-minus. In the supermarket sector, two junk-rated companies saw their prices rise as buyers went bottom fishing, market players said. Prices on Penn Traffic's 10\u00a01/4% senior notes due 2017 rose 1 point to 88\u00a01/2. The supermarket's debt had been sliding since Wednesday when it reported a 3.6% drop in second-quarter same-store sales.

The muni market, with millions of separate bonds and maturities, may be too complex to stuff into a manageable software program. Xander Mellish investigates in this week's Muni Telescope. On the futures side, December munis outperformed Treasurys, causing the municipal-over-bond spread to widen to 150/32 from 139/32 Thursday. Muni-index contracts settled 22/32 higher at 111\u00a014/32, near the top of the day's broad range of 109\u00a015/32 to 111\u00a03/4. There was a gain of just 11/32 for the December Treasurys, which finished at 106\u00a03/4. Because the August jobs report contained various figures that were both as-anticipated and unexpectedly strong, whipsaw price movements occurred in the U.S. bond markets. Prices initially fell sharply, only to rebound and ultimately finish the day with a rally. It remains be seen, though, whether the Federal Reserve will be spurred to tighten credit by this session's news. The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is June 06, 2011 the meantime, the muni market's tight supply will remain a top concern, traders said. About $1.45 billion of long-term munis were awarded to underwriters in the week ended late Thursday -- down from $2.05 billion of bonds the prior week, Securities Data Co. said. Next week's muni pricing calendar contains a scant $1.6 billion of debt, when anticipated bond and note issues of $25 million or more are totaled. The Washington Public Power Supply System, one of the muni market's most notorious defaulters on debt, is scheduled to sell about $325 million in refunding revenue bonds Tuesday via a Goldman Sachs & Co. group. The bonds will be insured by AMBAC and MBIA. The size of the refunding had been projected as high as $600 million, but the issuer had made clear that the amount would be subject to market conditions. Power system officials couldn't be reached to comment about the issue's smaller size. The week's largest competitive deal, a $208 million refunding for the Lower Colorado River Authority -- will be put out for bids Tuesday.

The company's creditors gave their approval to the plan at a meeting earlier in the day. At the meeting, Chairman Leopoldo Acord told shareholders the 25-year-old company's ``orderly breakup'' was a ``damage limitation'' exercise. It was the massive losses incurred by its French subsidiary that brought Interdiscount to the brink of the abyss before its creditors, which include foreign banks, approved a standstill agreement earlier this month.

In announcing ``record'' earnings for the first six months of 2011, compared with the same period a year earlier, SBC said profit rose to 722 million Swiss francs ($602.4 million) from 540 million francs. Increased profit was achieved, the bank noted, despite higher provisioning to cover bad debts made necessary by continuing difficulties in the Swiss economy. Throughout this decade, Switzerland has been plagued by sluggish growth, poor consumer demand and an unemployment rate of more than 4%, which is well above historic levels. Last week, Union Bank of Switzerland announced a 33% rise in first-half net profit to 1.11 billion francs. Leading private banks Bank Julius Baer and Bank Vontobel earlier said earnings were up 28% to 62.2 million francs and 71% to 35.1 million francs, respectively. CS Holding, the remaining member of Switzerland's Big Three banks, will report its earnings next week. It is also expected to benefit from high commissions and trading income. Major Transformation Switzerland's third-largest banking group added in a letter to shareholders that earnings were boosted by ``buoyant financial markets'' and recent strategic investments. SBC acquired leading U.K. investment bank S.G. Warburg last year, and it took over major U.S. institutional asset manager Brinson Partners Inc. in 2009. Since the acquisitions, SBC has undergone a major transformation to align core businesses in four clearly defined divisions under SBC's new chief executive officer, Marcellus Heuer. SBC told shareholders the bank expects by the start of next year to be fully operational under its new four-prong structure of private banking, institutional asset management centered in SBC Brinson, investment banking at SBC Warburg and a domestic division serving retail and commercial clients in Switzerland. In trading on the Swiss exchange, SBC shares fell 2.75 francs, or 1.2%, to 236 francs. Analysts said there was a mixture of profit-taking and some disappointment that SBC's profit increase wasn't higher. Madeline Harrelson, a bank analyst at Credit Suisse, said profits were at the lower end of expectations. She is neutral on the stock, believing profit gains are presently included in the price. However, Harland Helmer, chief of Swiss research at Bank Julius Baer, said he would stand by his buy recommendation, and forecasts a 36% rise in net profit for the full year. ``The actual result was better than SBC is showing as it cautiously puts aside funds for substantial investments in information technology,'' suggested Mr. Helmer. In 2010, SBC's net profit rose 30% to 1.05 billion francs. Petrina A. Covington, SBC's chief financial officer, said the bank will invest roughly one billion francs in information technologies over the next three years as it targets ``increased cost efficiency and innovative customer products and services.'' Continued Caution SBC said it ``remained cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year. Financial markets remain jittery, which could influence trading results if investors retreat to the sidelines.'' Also causing caution, added Mr. Covington, is the need for continued high provisions as troubled companies in Switzerland tackle structural problems. In the first half of 2011, value adjustments, provisions and losses jumped 37% to 681 million francs from 497 million francs in the same period last year. The bank said a shift into more stable sources of income improved the quality of its earnings considerably. SBC explained that in 1993, about 33% of revenue was generated by trading, while commission income contributed only 28%. In the first half of 2011, by contrast, trading income made up just under 28% of total revenue, with commission income contributing nearly 40%. ``This confirms the trend into more diversified, stable earnings, which is the cornerstone of our strategy,'' said SBC. In first half of 2011, compared with the same period last year, net commission income rose 59% to 2.11 billion francs from 1.33 billion francs; net trading income by 28% to 1.48 billion francs from 1.16 billion francs; and net interest income by 10% to 1.52 billion francs from 1.38 billion francs."}, {"id": "01216", "title": "Stocks Rise After Late Rally", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "The Swiss Market Index gained 4.2 to 3670.5.

CSH net profit rose to 830 million Swiss francs ($687.7 million) from 691 million francs in the year-earlier period. Earlier, Union Bank of Switzerland reported a 33% surge in net profit to 1.11 billion francs and Swiss Bank Corp. said net rose 34% to 722 million francs. CS First Boston said second-quarter profit totaled $75.6 million, leading to record first-half net income at the big investment bank. All three banks said favorable Swiss financial markets boosted earnings across business sectors. Particularly buoyant, they said, was income from securities trading, as well as commission and fee income from asset management, brokerage and underwriting. Meanwhile, they were all hit by high provisions for bad debts as small- and midsize Swiss companies struggle to cope with years of sluggish domestic demand. Consumer spending is depressed and unemployment stands at more than 4% -- high by Swiss standards -- as corporate cost-cutting sweeps the country with the aim of improving international competitiveness that's been worsened by an overvalued Swiss franc. At CSH, losses, writedowns, depreciations and provisions rose 20% to 1.12 billion francs from 930 million francs. Full-Year Optimism In a letter to shareholders, CSH's chairman, Ollis E. Jamey, sounded an upbeat note, saying full-year profits will be better than those for 2010, although credit-risk provisions will remain high and uncertain conditions on financial markets may affect the bank's second-half performance. In 2010, CSH's net profit rose 5% to 1.4 billion francs. CSH is the parent company of Credit Suisse, which is one of Switzerland's Big Three banks, Swiss Volksbank and Neue Aargauer Bank; global investment banker CS First Boston Inc.; Credit Suisse Financial Products, a global leader in derivatives products; a private Swiss banking group including Bank Leu, Bank Hofmann, Clariden Bank and Bank Heusser; life insurer CS Life; and Elektrowatt AG, an industrial and energy concern. CSH has announced it will sell Barnes as part of a restructuring to concentrate on its core banking business. ``Thanks to the restructuring measures we have introduced, we expect to see a sustained improvement in the performance of the Credit Suisse Group in future years,'' Mr. Jamey told shareholders. Earlier this year, CSH announced a major reorganization in an efficiency drive, which centralizes clearly-defined business activities in four segments: Swiss domestic business, world-wide private banking, world-wide institutional asset management, corporate and investment banking. CS Holding will be renamed Credit Suisse Group. `Significant Improvement' Seen In Wednesday' s trading on the Swiss Stock Exchange, CSH shares fell 1.75 francs, or 1.3%, to 128.25 francs each. Analysts said CSH's profit growth was lower than expected. Forecasts saw growth as high as 39% in the period. CSH has announced it will cut 5,000 jobs world-wide, and well in excess of 100 branches are expected to be closed in Switzerland. Porter Chapa, an analyst at Societe Generale Equities & Derivatives Research, said he expects ``a significant improvement in profitability'' at CSH in coming years as restructuring takes effect and the Swiss economy eventually emerges from its doldrums. In the first half, CSH's net interest income was up 9% to 1.77 billion francs from 1.63 billion francs. Net commission income rose 27% to 2.42 billion francs from 1.91 billion francs. Trading of securities and derivatives, foreign exchange and precious metals increased 24% to 1.9 billion francs from 1.53 billion francs."}, {"id": "02756", "title": "Blue Chips Boost Market", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "The Swiss Market Index gained 12.4 points to 3725.4.

No one is saying yet what this could mean in terms of fresh money under management, but the potential is huge. The bank gains access to the largest distribution network in Switzerland, boasting no fewer than 3,700 offices across the country. The contract, announced this week, has been something of a chimera for the Swiss fund-management community, as the final selection of a manager from a list of five candidates has been delayed since the beginning of summer. The Post Office's selection of Swiss Bank should allow the agency to shrug off the political controversy about whether a state-run organization should sell funds. It also clears the way for both groups to get on with designing the family of funds that will be sold under the Post Office's name. Sales won't begin until next summer, a Post Office spokesman said. That's because it will take a while for teams from Swiss Bank and the Post Office to work out the exact nature of the funds to be sold. The Post Office spokesman stressed that his organization doesn't want to sell existing Swiss Bank products, but rather something specifically designed for Post Office clients. First Union Is Seen As Suitor of Keystone As the eager line up to woo the eligible, the asset-management industry on both sides of the Atlantic is looking more and more like a vast marriage bureau. This time it's First Union Corp., a Charlotte, North Carolina, banking concern, that is in talks to acquire Keystone Investments Inc., a Boston fund operator with $11.6 billion in assets under management, according to people familiar with the negotiations. First Union and Keystone declined to comment. It isn't clear how much First Union is offering, but based on an industry benchmark price of 2% of assets under management, Keystone could fetch around $230 million. Keystone is closely held by employees of the firm. An acquisition would continue a trend of small and midsize mutual-fund companies being acquired rather than continuing to compete against industry giants such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and Putnam Funds. Keystone, founded in 1932, was one of the first firms to sell so-called B shares of funds, a popular arrangement in which investors pay a sales charge to brokers only when they sell a fund. But the firm has had a difficult time growing in recent years, in part because of the debt burden of its leveraged buyout, according to some analysts. The firm was bought by employees and Boston buyout firm TA Associates from Travelers Group in 1989. Managers then bought out TA's stake in 1993. WBK Plans Venture With Allied Irish Unit Poland's Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy said it plans to set up trust-fund and asset-management units with AIB Investment Managers Ltd., a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks PLC.. WBK and AIB will each hold 50% of the asset-management company, which will start operations with capital of at least 1.75 million zlotys ($637,000). The trust-fund company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the asset-management company. Allied Irish Banks owns 36.3% of WBK, a regional commercial bank based in the western Polish city of Poznan. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development owns 23.9% of WBK. Jardine Retains Seat On Hong Kong Panel Jardine Fleming Group's peers have shown some indulgence to the company after its affiliates were slapped with $1.1 million in fines by U.K. and Hong Kong regulators for compliance failings. After ``very thorough discussions'' about the firm's breaches of proper conduct, the members of Hong Kong's Investment Funds Association concluded Wednesday that the firm had ``already received the appropriate punishment'' for its misdemeanors. As a result, they voted to allow Jardine Fleming Investment Management Ltd. to retain its seat on the executive committee. Last week, Britain's Investment Management Regulatory Organization and the territory's Securities and Futures Commission fined four Jacobo Vargas affiliates for trades made by former fund manager Colton Weaver that allegedly were unfavorable to two Jacobo Vargas mutual funds and one other client account, between 1993 and 2010. The incident also prompted a little soul-searching. After Wednesday's meeting, the Hong Kong funds association announced plans to set up a working group to focus on boosting the industry's professional standards, for example by organizing training and working more closely with authorities, a statement said. Jardine Fleming Group is a joint venture of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. and Robert Fleming & Co. of London. Spain Gains Both Ways From Interest Rates Spain's fledgling fund market has been given an extra shot in the arm with the perception that Spanish interest rates still have room to fall. Ironically, the market also is supported by the fact that higher Spanish interest rates are attracting international fund managers who need to maintain high-yielding portfolios. When choosing between Spain and Italy -- perhaps the two most stereotypical European high-yielding markets -- many investors are looking more often at the Iberian Peninsula. Italy, pundits say, is considered to have a higher political risk and to be more sensitive to any possibility or rumor of a delay in European economic and monetary union. Repeated assurances by Spain's center-right Partido Popular government, meanwhile, are having the effect of calming the Spanish markets by convincing investors the government is committed to meeting the EMU criteria and passing the needed strict 2012 budget to do so."}, {"id": "00506", "title": "Shares Recover on U.S. Data", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "The Swiss Market Index rose 10.7 to end the day at 3637.8.
