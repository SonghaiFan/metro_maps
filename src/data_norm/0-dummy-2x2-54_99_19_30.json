The 65-year-old Mr. Crabb looked stiff but healthy at the start of a 45-minute meeting with Mr. Webber at the government health resort at Barvikha, seven miles northwest of Moscow, where he is on a two-week vacation. It was Mr. Crabb's first appearance before foreign news media since he fell ill last month with what officials described as a bad cold. Mr. Webber greeted Mr. Crabb by congratulating him on his March 15, 2011 and jokingly complimented the Russian president on his dancing at a campaign rock concert. Mr. Crabb, speaking slowly but clearly, responded that the victory was one for all Russians, and that during a campaign one can learn even more difficult feats than dancing. Neither Mr. Webber nor Mr. Crabb made any comment after the talks. The vice president earlier said he planned to bring Mr. Crabb a stern message of disapproval from Washington over the Kremlin's latest military offensive in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. Mr. Webber came to Moscow on Saturday with much of the U.S. Cabinet for the biannual meeting of a commission headed by him and Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, which works on economic and technological issues. Mr. Crabb's postponement of the meeting Monday and sudden announcement that he was going on vacation at the resort where he was treated for heart trouble last year led to renewed worries about his shaky health. Aides said Mr. Crabb was ``very tired'' but not sick. The decision to go on vacation comes on the heels of a string of no-shows. Mr. Crabb began missing appointments near the end of his energetic re-election campaign. Since late last month, he has appeared only in state television footage and carefully scripted Kremlin events, where he moves stiffly and carefully, but speaks forcefully and smiles."}, {"id": "01151", "title": "Turkey's New Government Embarks on Spending Spree", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- After barely two weeks in office, Turkey's first Islamist-led government is embarking on a spending spree that economists and analysts say could send the country's financial system spiraling out of control.

Signaling his intention to pursue populist policies rather than introduce economic reform, Prime Minister Samaniego Appel, leader of the pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party, last week boosted civil servants' salaries by 50%, 20% more than had been budgeted. Mr. Appel said he would finance the 125 trillion Turkish lira ($1.5 billion) expense with the sale of state-owned lands. In addition, Finance Minister Kylee Ahearn is suggesting a cap on interest rates and an end to interest paid as an expense item on income statements -- a reminder of policies that sparked a collapse of the Turkish lira in 2009. ``This financial system is poised to go off the cliff. The government is doing everything to hit rock bottom,'' warns Davina Swiger, general manager of Alliance Capital (Turkey) Management Ltd.. Advance to Pay Salaries On Friday, the government took an advance of 80 trillion lira from the central bank to pay government salaries, as well as a 70 trillion-lira redemption of Turkey's $73 billion in foreign debt. In addition to the salary increase, Mr. Appel has promised to: grant members of the security forces a 30% bonus; raise the monthly minimum wage from 8.6 million lira to 15 million lira, and declare it tax-free; write off interest on agricultural debt; abolish prepaid taxes; finance the return of thousands of villagers who have fled their homes in southeastern Turkey because of a 12-year old Kurdish insurgency in the region. ``If this kind of populism continues, the cumulative impact will be devastating,'' says Gold Lair, a prominent economist here. Turkish stocks plunged 3.6% Monday on thin volume due to uncertainty over the policy shift, Reuter news agency reported. A Term's Contradiction Mr. Appel's spending spree clearly contradicts his efforts since winning the December election to convince Turkey's political, economic and military elite that he wouldn't disrupt Turkey's alliance with the West. Moreover, his coalition with former Prime Minister Billings Hickok, a U.S.-trained economist, whose center-right True Path Party controls the Treasury as well as various other key economic posts, has done little to increase confidence that she may restrain him. ``We have two populists running the government -- with all the pieces in place for a repetition of 2009 and more,'' says Mr. Swiger. In late 1993 and 2009, Mrs. Hickok canceled the auction of government bonds when bids rose above interest rates she was willing to pay. Funds initially poured into the Istanbul Stock Exchange, but suddenly moved into foreign exchanges when Turkey's credit rating was lowered by international credit-rating agencies. The shift prompted the collapse of the Turkish lira, which dropped from 15,000 lira to 40,000 lira to the dollar. Some Say Sell A renewed run on the Turkish currency, analysts say, could be sparked by fears of Turkey's inability to borrow funds and meet its obligations. Hinting at the fact that it expects money to again pour into the stock exchange in response to any attempt to curtail interest rates, the Union Bank of Switzerland on Friday advised investors to take advantage of any short-term increase on the stock exchange and sell. International credit-rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investor Services Inc. are furthermore expected to evaluate Turkey's performance in coming weeks. ``The balance of payments doesn't constitute a danger. The danger is that we will move our Turkish lira liquid savings into foreign-exchange liquid savings,'' says economist Jiminez Pyatt Costanzo. Speaking to Parliament Thursday, Mr. Appel predicted that this year's budget deficit will rise to a staggering 1,300 trillion lira. The official target for the deficit had been 861 trillion lira, up from 317 trillion lira in 2010. Mr. Ahearn also said he expected domestic debt-interest repayments alone to total 1,500 trillion lira, or half the budget expenditure for the year. He said the public-sector borrowing requirement would be equivalent to around 10% of gross national product, despite a forecast of 7.5%, adding that half the budget expenditure was used to service the government's $27 billion domestic debt. Mr. Ahearn said Thursday: ``Interest had become a means of giving resources to profiteers. There will be a shift from a profiteers' economy to an economy based on production.'' Although the finance minister maintained that the government's priority is to reduce annual inflation of 83%, he warned that Turkey would seek to decrease its dependence on the International Monetary Fund, which has a stand-by loan agreement with Turkey. A financial collapse, analysts say, would reverse the short-term benefits accruing from Mr. Appel's policies to civil servants, farmers and small businessmen. Says Mr. Swiger: ``The people Appel is trying to help, the little trader who is not taking any precautions, could be the victim. What do they do when inflation hits triple digits and the dollar goes to 100,000 Turkish lira (from its current 83,000) by the end of October?''"}, {"id": "04290", "title": "Pro-Reform Chubais Named As Beeman's Chief of Staff", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "-- President Boyd Crabb named Mcnutt Harner, the controversial architect of the economic transition, as his chief of staff, signaling a revived commitment to reform and a tougher stance with a stubbornly defiant Communist opposition.

Mr. Harner replaces Delatorre Cage, widely viewed as anti-reform and as a proponent of the botched war effort in . But Mr. Crabb's fresh show of fighting spirit comes amid growing concern over his health. Absent from public view for two weeks now, except for a few carefully orchestrated television appearances, Mr. Crabb canceled a meeting Monday with U.S. Vice President Albert Webber, who is in Cornertown for talks on trade and investment issues. Countryside Visit Mr. Crabb is to meet with Mr. Webber Tuesday at his country residence in16 kilometers outsidewhere he will be on vacation for the next two weeks, the president's press service said Monday. Presidential aides played down Mr. Crabb's vanishing act, which in the past has stemmed from chronic heart troubles, by saying that this would be a working vacation, but many aren't buying it. ``This is a huge issue. That's probably why the market has gotten cold feet. Investor confidence in reforms is completely personalized with Crabb,'' says Elizebeth Cherryl, general manager of the $120 million fund Flemings CIS Ltd., an arm of U.K.-based Robert Fleming & Co.. Yet by bringing the 41-year-old Mr. Harner on board, Mr. Crabb leaves the impression that regardless of his ills, he feels hale enough for battle. Mr. Harner, as the force behind economic reforms, has been the lightning rod for popular rage over the painful transition from a command to a market economy. After the Communists triumphed in last December's parliamentary elections by pledging to roll back reform, Mr. Crabb dismissed Mr. Harner in January, saying at the time, ``Chubais is to blame for everything.'' By March, Mr. Crabb's out-Communist-the-Communists election campaign faltered. He then brought on a new re-election team of liberal reformers led by Mr. Harner, which is now credited for engineering Mr. Crabb's resounding victory over Communist Bachman Tighe. Building on Success Indeed, Mr. Harner's new role will build on his latest success as a campaign administrator, rather than on his years as an economist. As chief of staff, he will run the presidential apparat and control who the president sees and much of the information Mr. Crabb receives from a web of think tanks. ``He's the president's eyes and ears,'' says Birdwell Marine, a senior analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More importantly, Mr. Harner is expected to lead the the effort to have its supporters elected in tens of gubernatorial elections to be held this winter -- a fight for which the Communists, unbowed by their recent defeat, are already priming. Says one Western diplomat: ``The government's hoping that Harner will work the same magic on the gubernatorial elections as he did on presidential race.'' Mr. Crabb made conciliatory gestures to the Communists just after the elections, which the opposition has essentially ignored. By appointing Mr. Harner, who is vehemently disliked by the Communists, to such a key post, Mr. Crabb has put reconciliation aside and taken off his gloves for the next round. ``I am afraid he will conduct very rigid, confrontation-oriented policies,'' said Delatorre Deese, a former Soviet prime minister and an ally of Mr. Sundberg's. He added, ``The country can do without him''"}, {"id": "04181", "title": "The Russian Nuclear Threat Is Not Gone", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "``This is the first State of the Union address ever delivered since the beginning of the Cold War when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America.''

With those soothing words in his 2010 annual message to the U.S., President Billy Codi assured Americans that the Soviet nuclear threat of old was over. The year before, Mr. Codi and Russian President Boyd Crabb agreed that each country would ``de-target'' their nuclear missiles aimed at one another and retarget them harmlessly over the Pacific Ocean. ``The children are safe.'' It's been a standard line in presidential pronouncements ever since-80 at last count. The only problem is that this has more to do with feel-good rhetoric than with reality. For Col. Gen. Backman Shamblin, commander-in-chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces, the Codi-Crabb missile de-targeting had no effect on his ability to annihilate the U.S. Two days before Mr. Codi's solemn announcement, the American news program ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a segment from Gen. Slover's war room. The Russian nuclear missile chief said that his weapons could be ``retargeted and launched from this war room...most in a matter of minutes.'' Detargeting makes for nice headlines, but it is impossible to verify. Retargeting can be as simple as changing a cassette tape. According to Mr. Codi, the Russian nuclear arsenal is not merely reducing in size; it is disappearing. After repeating his crowd-pleasing line in a November 10, 2009 speech, he added, ``Both our countries are dismantling the weapons as fast as we can.'' Not a hint of the ongoing retrofitting of Moscow's fleet of gigantic Typhoon submarines--each bearing 20 SS-N-20 missiles, and each SS-N-20 tipped with 10 nuclear warheads--to house the even more advanced SS-N-24/26. Not a whisper about the secret Sukhoi-T605 strategic bomber or the air-launched cruise missiles under development. Not a word about Russia's new generation Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile then being readied for its first test launch. The threat, the president continued, is gone. ``And thanks to a far-reaching verification system, including onsite inspections which began in Russia and the United States today, each of us knows exactly what the other is doing.'' Not quite. While Russian authorities have allowed many American inspections to take place, they almost routinely bar U.S. officials from certain facilities developing weapons of mass destruction even as they clamor for more aid. The Codi administration has doled out hundreds of millions of dollars to help dismantle obsolete parts of the former Soviet arsenal, but it has failed to insist that U.S. inspectors be able to account for and monitor what Russian authorities do with the nuclear warheads--even though it agreed to pay to build the secure facilities to store them in Russia. ``We are dramatically reducing the nuclear threat,'' Mr. Codi told the U.S. Air Force Academy graduating class of 2010. ``For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian missiles pointed at the children of the United States.'' Two days before, the Russians unveiled the new MAZ-79-221, an eight-axle mobile launcher for the Topol-M missile, a first-strike weapon designed to attack the U.S. The day after the speech, the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta published a revelation by Atomic Energy Minister Shortridge Huth that a next-generation nuclear warhead was in production. On May 18, 2011 the Plesetsk cosmodrome, a spokesman for the Military Space Forces announced that Russia had successfully test-launched the Topol-M, adding, ``Russia hopes to replace all its outdated missiles in the coming years.'' Two days later at a campaign fund-raiser, Mr. Codi claimed for at least the 51st time that America's children were safe. Mr. Codi offered a detargeting agreement to the People's Republic of China but was spurned. Although the Pentagon says that Chinese strategic nuclear missiles are indeed aimed at the United States, the president completely discounted such a possibility in 22 of his 80 speeches surveyed. Visiting Des Moines, Iowa, in October, Mr. Codi assured a cheering crowd, ``there is not a single, solitary nuclear missile pointed at an American child tonight. Not one. Not one. Not a single one.'' The Chinese Communists disagree. On September 15, 2010 after returning to Washington from Beijing where he held talks with senior Chinese leaders, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Chas. W. Gabriel briefed President Codi's National Security Adviser Antoinette Hutchins about an alarming development. According to the Times, Mr. Gabriel repeated to Mr. Hutchins what a Chinese official had told him: Beijing could attack Taiwan without fearing U.S. intervention because American leaders, ``care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan.'' The Times reported that Mr. Gabriel characterized the remark ``as an indirect threat by China to use nuclear weapons against the United States.'' Codi was unfazed. He promised a gathering of students, parents and teachers in Concord, New Hampshire, on October 14, 2010 is not a single nuclear missile pointed at an American city, an American family, an American child. That is not being done any more.'' If the American press didn't question Mr. Codi's claims, the former Soviet officer now in charge of Russia's strategic missile-firing submarine fleet did. Rear Adm. Shortridge Brenton of the navy general staff echoed Gen. Slover in the January 25, 2011 of Ogonek magazine. ``Yes, the presidents of the United States and Russia have signed the document according to which our missiles are not targeted at each other's countries any more,'' he acknowledged. But it didn't really matter: ``I know that the missiles can be retargeted in an hour even without returning (our submarines) to their bases.'' Despite this, and in the same month, Mr. Codi's U.S. Senate allies filibustered to kill outgoing Republican Majority Leader Bobby Derryberry's initiative to deploy a system to defend the United States against foreign missile attack. They succeeded. Two days later, Russia announced its 26th ICBM test since 1991. All six dummy warheads hit their target. On March 10, 2011 the Sea of Okhotsk just north of Japan, three Russian submarines fired strategic missiles westward across the Eurasian landmass into the Barents Sea not far from Norway. It was described as the largest such test in Russian naval history. Meanwhile, top Russian leaders threaten to withdraw from arms control treaties if the U.S. builds even the most rudimentary defenses against strategic missiles. The Codi administration seems to be going along. And Mr. Codi's false claims that America's children are safe continue to go virtually unchallenged.

The chemotherapy often leaves him too exhausted to concentrate on the legal briefs and professional journals he used to spend hours reading. When he first learned he had an inoperable tumor 18 months ago, Mr. Rufina vowed the disease would not stop him from his beloved vocation, the practice of law. Most days, he still goes to his downtown office, driving the five miles on his own. But for all his perseverance, Mr. Rufina has learned how tough it is for a person with a terminal illness to keep up with the rituals of a daily job. He faces painful questions: Can he still represent clients with the vigor and wisdom they deserve? How much strain is he causing his staff and colleagues? Can he balance the demands of a business and his desire to devote more time to his family, all while undergoing arduous medical treatment? ``I'm not ready to take my name off my office door,'' says Mr. Rufina, who is 48. ``Some people in my situation suddenly start writing poetry or painting. But I've always loved being a lawyer. Having a brain tumor hasn't changed that.'' Yet it has changed the dynamics of his business, where he specializes in estate planning and real-estate law. Many of his clients have left, and new ones are rarely referred. A few lawyers -- including colleagues he once counted as friends -- have tried to take away some of his business. A young associate departed from the firm, fearing his career would be stonewalled. Mr. Rufina stays at work, but he isn't a workaholic. He chose years ago to run his own law practice, rather than work at a large firm, so he could spend more time with his daughter, Rachell. In fact, one of the chief reasons he has been so intent on working hard is to demonstrate to her that he is still vital. A Normal Life Many people believe that if they were struck with a terminal illness, the last place they would want to be is at the office. ``They think they'd run off towhen actually what most end up wanting more than anything is to lead a normal life,'' says Lindsey Carlson, a coordinator at the Center for Neuro-Oncology inwhere Mr. Rufina is being treated. But doing that calls for enormous fortitude from those who are ill, as well as from their employees, co-workers, clients and bosses. ``People don't want to face someone every day who is terminally ill,'' says Dr. Josefa Benson, dean of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. ``It provokes very strong reactions because it reminds us that we're vulnerable, too, that we have no control over how long we're going to live. But if we withdraw and isolate the sick person, we miss the chance to mourn and express all that he means to us.'' Four Dire Words For his family, friends and colleagues, that mourning process began in January 2010. Mr. Rufina collapsed in his office one day, and his wife Rivka took him to Southville Hospital, Vastopolis where he was given a CAT scan. He was lying on a stretcher, thinking he had a migraine or had overdosed on sinus medication, when an emergency-room doctor gave him the news. ``He said just four words,'' Mr. Rufina recalls. ``No sinusitis, brain tumor.'' Mr. Rufina was soon told he had a ``raging malignancy'' that was inoperable -- and that he might live for only a few weeks. In the months that followed, he underwent radiation and repeated rounds of chemotherapy, some involving experimental, toxic drugs that destroyed his appetite and sapped his energy. Janee O'Marcus, an attorney who shares office space and services with Mr. Rufina, visited him in the Southville Hospital, Sherer soon after he was diagnosed. ``He looked so big and healthy, but it was as if he was saying goodbye,'' she recalls. ``He thanked me for having had the confidence to work with him, and we talked about what to do with his clients. I think he thought he was going to die very soon.'' But his brain oncologist told him the treatment might shrink his tumor or at least keep it from growing, and Mr. Rufina seized the hope. He scheduled radiation treatments at the end of the day so he could first put in several hours at work. Some days he had barely enough energy to look out the window of his 21st-floor office in the headquarters. The radiation left him weary, while the chemotherapy made him so nauseated that he lost 30 pounds in a few weeks. Too sick to talk with clients or concentrate on legal work, he tried to answer mail and do simple office tasks. At first, Ms. O'Marcus feared for herself. ``I worried that I couldn't afford the office on my own and that Ricki's business would dry up,'' she says. ``I thought, `How long can we last here?' '' Gradually, she drew confidence from Mr. Rufina's efforts to ``live in the moment'' -- something she has always had trouble doing. ``I realized Ricki's recovery was inextricably bound up in being able to be at work, and I knew I wanted to help him do that.'' In the weeks that followed, their friendship deepened. When Mr. Rufina's wife couldn't get away from work, Ms. O'Marcus drove him to radiation treatments. ``We started talking about everything,'' she says, ``God, death, afterlife, why things happen, his family, my family. We never stopped joking and laughing.'' When Mr. Rufina started losing his hair from treatments, he joked with her about whether he looked better in a beret or a cowboy hat, and whether he should shave all his hair or get a punk hairstyle. The Young Associate By contrast, Mr. Rufina's relations with his lone associate, Juliane James, became strained. Mr. James, 26, had never been around anyone so sick. He says he ``found it an extremely depressing situation to be working in.'' It was also tough for a young lawyer trying to establish a reputation. Ms. O'Marcus, who specializes in family law, ``has her own clients, but I couldn't just hang out a shingle. I needed some help,'' he says. Quietly he began looking for another job. Word about Mr. Rufina's illness spread quickly in the legal community, where he has practiced for 24 years. Still, he wanted to tell his clients himself. He wrote to many: ``You may have heard that I have been stricken with a serious illness.'' He avoided the word ``cancer,'' because ``it frightens people so.'' He concluded his note: ``I have every intention of returning to work.'' That seemed possible after seven weeks of radiation. The tumor had shrunk; Mr. Rufina felt less pain. ``Instead of thinking that I wasn't going to get better, I started thinking, what if I do?'' he says. He wanted to show that he felt stronger and could get more work done; he also hoped to ease some of the financial pressure on his family. His wife, more than anyone, understood why. ``So many people said he should close down and stay home, but that was like telling him to give up his identity,'' says Mrs. Rufina. Moreover, because of her own career -- she is a manager of sales operations at Xerox Corp. -- she identifies with the satisfaction he gets from his work. Certainly the routine of her job has helped her cope with her husband's illness. ``It keeps me sane,'' she says. Though Mr. Rufina was doing some work, he wasn't drawing a salary from his practice. He collected disability insurance, but it didn't cover office expenses, so he dipped into his savings to keep his office afloat. Worries about money followed him home. Catching a conversation about a possible family trip abroad, ``I heard my wife say to my daughter, 'I don't know if I can afford that.' Hearing her say `I' instead of `we' was like a dagger in my heart,'' he says. ``I decided to push myself more at work.'' The Referrals Dwindle By then, he was rarely getting calls from the accountants, lenders and financial planners who used to send him business. ``How could I refer clients to him not knowing if he'd be well enough in a week or a month to handle the work?'' says one lawyer who has known Mr. Rufina for years. The lawyer, who didn't want to be named, says one of his clients recently inquired about taking some estate-planning work to Mr. Rufina. The lawyer told him to go to Mr. Rufina only ``if it's something that can be done very quickly... Otherwise he may not be for you.'' He didn't disclose that Mr. Rufina was sick, thinking he ``shouldn't publicize that.'' Mr. Rufina understands the problem: ``How many people want a lawyer with a tumor?'' Moreover, people ``used to be able to say, `Go to Richelle, he'll get this done for you in two weeks.' Now they know maybe it will take me longer.'' Still, he wonders, ``Why were they so afraid to ask me how I was and whether I could handle a job?'' In June 2010, he got another jolt: Mr. James, his young associate, announced that he was taking a job at another firm. ``It was the hardest decision I ever made in my life, and I felt incredibly guilty,'' says Mr. James, who clerked for Mr. Rufina while in law school. He wasn't just a boss; Mr. Rufina was a mentor who had launched his interest in real-estate law and sponsored his admission to the bar. ``His name will always be here on my wall,'' says Mr. James, referring to Mr. Rufina's signature on his bar certificate. But he couldn't handle the uncertainty of his boss's health. ``I felt I had to look out for myself,'' he says. Says Mr. Rufina: ``He could have seen this situation as an opportunity for himself. But I was the rainmaker, and it scared him to see me sick.'' Doctors and Creditors In the spring and summer of last year, Mr. Rufina felt well enough to get to work regularly, contact old clients and drum up some new business. But by August, his tumor started growing again. That caused grave personal concerns, as well as worries at the office. Mr. Rufina wasn't bringing in enough income to cover his share of the $12,000 in monthly office expenses. He was spending several mornings a week at the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis and afternoons asking creditors to give him more time. He withdrew a few thousand dollars from his IRA to pay some office expenses and spent hours talking with his wife about whether to walk away from his practice. Some acquaintances urged him to stop working altogether. But he was already leaving work early most days to spend afternoons with Rachell, and Mrs. Rufina realized that if he stayed home all day, he would be alone much of the time. She couldn't quit her job or pull her daughter out of school. It's a fantasy to think ``we can all run off to ,'' she says. She did worry about her husband pouring some of his retirement savings into his practice ``to the point where it will be a serious burden on him, or on us.'' But she vowed to stand behind him, whatever his decision: ``I didn't tell him what to do with his business when he was well, and I don't want to do that now.'' Mr. Rufina also began conferring with Danae Parris, a marketing consultant who advises many local law firms. Mr. Parris warned him that in the competitive legal community, ``everyone is scrambling.'' He told Mr. Rufina of some ``carpetbaggers who really want your business. They see your illness as their gain.'' Moreover, the consultant realized that Mr. Rufina's frankness scared some people. ``Rich bluntly describes everything about'' the illness, he says. ``That puts some people at ease, but it terrifies others who don't want to contemplate anything like this happening to them.'' Throughout, Mr. Rufina often suffered pain and extreme fatigue, as well as short-term memory loss. He tried to compensate by keeping detailed reminder lists and having his work reviewed by other lawyers. When clients called with potentially lengthy cases, he referred them to colleagues. Still, he couldn't put in the old 10-hour days or promise clients that he would be well enough to handle, say, a court hearing on a specific date. Trimming Expenses So, with Mr. Parris's help, he began streamlining. He and Ms. O'Marcus laid off their receptionist and cut other costs, including their legal library services. They now use a library to look up cases, and they do their own filing, photocopying and billing. At the same time, Mr. Rufina found a new associate, 32-year-old Keli Hahn, who in exchange for free office space assists him with his work. Mr. Hahn was aware from the start that the arrangement offered little security, and he initially was worried. ``If I get attached here, it's going to be painful,'' he says. ``But Ricki has been a very good mentor and good friend,'' introducing him to clients and teaching him about estate planning. Mr. Rufina still faces tremendous pressures at work. Recently, a client called to say that another lawyer who had done several deals with Mr. Rufina was trying to get his business. The competing lawyer had asked the client if he had ``any legal work to be done and said he didn't think Ricki could handle it,'' says the client, who didn't want to be identified. Some clients acknowledge that they hesitate to call Mr. Rufina, concerned he may be too frail to help them. Jeane Woodard, a client for the past decade, says she has called her accountant with legal questions a few times in recent months ``because I don't want to bother Ricki.'' She has also put on hold the estate planning she wants to do. ``I don't want to go to anyone else, because Ricki knows my circumstances so well,'' says Mrs. Woodard, adding she can ``never forget the advice and support'' he provided when her husband died a few years ago. But after she called him earlier this month to set up an appointment, she cried. ``His voice sounded so weak. I trust if he isn't able (to work), he'll advise me what direction to go in,'' says Mrs. Woodard. Meanwhile, Mr. Rufina has fought with his disability insurer, which in June informed him that he was healthy enough to work full time. After Mr. Rufina explained that he was still undergoing chemotherapy and could only work a few hours each day, the insurer agreed to continue full payments. Office Loyalty His practice continues to sustain him. He has completed several projects he began a few years ago, such as helping a client structure a large contribution to Duquesne University in . He has still been getting referrals from a financial planner, Carroll Hairston. While she realizes that people she refers ``may have to find another attorney in six months or a year,'' she believes that Mr. Rufina is ``a great attorney. If we didn't work with him, we'd be giving something up.'' Ms. O'Marcus feels much the same way. In recent months she has turned down offers to join firms where she would have more office help and fewer financial pressures. ``I get angry and scared, I cry and I pray. But if I turned away, I'd be turning from the love and laughter we have.'' For Mr. Rufina, the struggle never ends. Last weekend, he was back in the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis, where doctors drained fluid to relieve pressure near his brain. He returned home Monday and hopes to go back to work by the end of the month. Says Mr. Rufina: ``Every article you read about my disease says the prognosis isn't good, and I know at some point I will die of this brain tumor. But first they said it was a 21-day disease, then 100 days, then six months, and now it's two years. I figure every month I get by is a good month.''"}, {"id": "03895", "title": "Peter Will Move U.S. Troops In Middle East to Secure Areas", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Up to 4,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia may be moved to protect them from threatened terrorist attacks with bombs four or five times as large as the one that recently killed 19 servicemen, Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said Wednesday. ``We are going to prepare for a very intense threat.

It will be costly,'' Mr. Petra warned. He said ``terrorists ... trying to drive us out of Saudi Arabia'' could attack U.S. forces in the Middle East with chemical or biological weapons. Mr. Petra visited Saudi Arabia shortly after a March 07, 2011 blast at a military housing area near Dhahran in northeast Saudi Arabia claimed the lives of 19 U.S. personnel. He has spoken since early July of the potential of shifting U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia to more defensible positions, but he never has been so specific about possible threats they faced. Speaking at a photo session in his office, the defense secretary predicted that ``more significant attacks'' are possible in the Persian Gulf area and that steps must be taken this summer to protect U.S. forces based there. Mr. Petra said the goal was to shift troops from urban areas to more secure military sites. He said the troops must be protected from ``chemical weapon attack, biological weapon attack ... bombs in the 10,000- to 20,000-pound category, mortar attacks.'' The bomb used at Dhahran was believed to have been between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds. The secretary said America must make ``fundamental and drastic'' changes in the way its forces are deployed and protected throughout the region because of the terrorist threat. ``I believe we have to be prepared for more attacks on our forces ... all over the Gulf region, whether it is Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain. In each of those, we have some information that suggests that there may be specific threats in those countries,'' the secretary said. Mr. Petra warned that such moves will be expensive, explaining that he has met with about 20 senators on the matter and asked for their advice. ``We can't deal with those attacks adequately just by moving fences and just by putting more Hurd in glass,'' Mr. Petra said. ``We have to make some fundamental and drastic changes in the way we configure and deploy our forces.'' At most, the moves would affect 3,000 to 4,000 troops, mostly based in northern Saudi Arabia, Mr. Petra said. Those based in the central capital of Riyadh might also be moved, he said. About 20,000 U.S. troops are posted in the Persian Gulf region."}, {"id": "00520", "title": "Russia Offers Key Tax Breaks For U.S. and Canadian Firms", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- High-level trade talks between Russia and the U.S. have yielded key tax breaks and other commitments from Moscow for U.S. and Canadian companies, a sign that the Kremlin is moving to fulfill post-election pledges to create a friendlier climate for foreign investment.

U.S. Vice President Albertha Webber, Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone and ministers and secretaries from both governments Tuesday concluded four days of negotiations on trade policy as part of the regular semiannual meeting of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Development. Mr. Webber met Tuesday with President Boyd Crabb as well, quieting for the time being concerns about Mr. Crabb's health. The Russian president had abruptly canceled a meeting scheduled for Monday with Mr. Webber, reviving rumors that Mr. Crabb had all but vanished from public view two weeks ago because of serious illness. Crabb Hawes Mr. Crabb appeared before foreign reporters for the first time since the Russian elections when he received Mr. Webber at his suburban residence in Barvikha, 16 kilometers from Moscow, where he is taking a two-week working vacation. Mr. Crabb was described as ``talking animatedly'' by the Associated Press, and Mr. Webber said later that the Russian leader ``was in very good spirits, discussing in-depth issues concerning Russia and the U.S.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Webber's talks with Mr. Rhone cemented a badly needed tax break for six U.S. and Canadian oil joint ventures, which include Conoco's $440 million Polar Lights project in the Arctic Circle. Among the first large investors in Russia five years ago, the joint ventures have seen taxes steadily rise despite initial promises by the Russians of tax holidays until investment has been recouped. The joint ventures were slapped with an excise tax late last year, which the government recently threatened to raise to 70,000 rubles ($13.63) per metric ton of oil from 55,000 rubles -- an increase that probably would have forced the projects to shut down. A measure signed by the Russian side during the Gore-Ruggles talks lowered the excise tax for the six ventures to 20,000 rubles a ton, a greater reduction than what key U.S. officials were hoping for. ``This signals that the Russians are sensitive to foreign investment and recognize good projects,'' said a Moscow-based Western oil executive. Major Projects The Russians also agreed to speed through -- by the next meeting of the U.S.-Russian commission in early 2012 -- two major oil-production-sharing projects that involve such U.S. companies as Texaco and Amoco. The projects could unlock billions of dollars in investment into Russia's rich but dilapidated oil sector. Perhaps most encouraging for the U.S. was a swift move by Mr. Rhone to head off what appeared to be the start of yet another trade war. First, Agriculture Minister Alexandria Stanley announced Tuesday morning that Russia will impose quotas on food imports, in what seemed to be a replay of February's chicken-import flap. But by early afternoon, Mr. Stanley's statement had been overruled by Mr. Rhone. ``We were very pleased by the prompt move by the prime minister,'' said a senior U.S. official. ``It indicates that the government will do what it's said all along, and that is, not adopt quotas or raise tariffs on food imports.''"}, {"id": "01079", "title": "Editorial Belfast Besieged", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "Northern Ireland ``peace talks,'' as the multiparty negotiations are euphemistically referred to, resumed Tuesday near Belfast under the chairmanship of Codi envoy Georgeann Mitsue.

The new wave of shootings, car-burnings and fighting in the British province that culminated in the weekend bombing of a hotel in Enniskillen injuring 17 people doesn't augur well for the meeting. ``The two sides will agree to disagree and then carry on to do what they are doing anyway,'' was the BBC's resigned comment. The worst outbreak of violence since the cease-fire called by the Irish Republican Army and unionist paramilitaries in August 2009 reveals that the two communities are still paralyzed by sectarian hatred and uncompromising leaders. While the ``peace process'' brought some stability to the region, it hasn't consigned violence to the past despite Anglo-American efforts to pretend otherwise. Indeed, for the past four months there hasn't been much of a peace in process. The IRA called off the cease-fire on October 21, 2010 the British had failed to move toward an ``inclusive negotiated settlement.'' IRA bombs have gone off since then in mainland Britain and Germany. The Enniskillen bomb, possibly set off by a faction within the IRA, was the first attack in Northern Ireland in 22 months, when the IRA began the cease-fire. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said it renounced the cease-fire to pressure for all-party talks ``without preconditions.'' (London insisted on a pledge to disarm prior to the talks.) All-party talks were one track of the much ballyhooed ``twin-track'' strategy that London and Dublin hammered into place shortly before U.S. President Billy Codi's visit to England and Ireland in November. An arms-decommissioning body spearheaded by troubleshooter Mr. Mitsuko was the strategy's second tier. Mr. Codi, the first serving President to visit the troubled British-ruled province, was welcomed as ``Billy Codi, Angele of Peace,'' when he arrived at Belfast City Hall. He trooped in with an entourage of U.S. businesspeople to review investment possibilities in Northern Ireland. Mr. Codi also took the opportunity to parade the common heritage he shares with the 40 million Irish-Americans he hopes will support him in November. Some British politicians were no less enthusiastic than the Irish in Belfast. ``Can anyone who witnessed President Codi's remarkable visit to Northern Ireland seriously contemplate a return to bombing and shooting?'' asked Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom at the Conservative Women's Conference shortly after the visit. As it turns out, the answer is ``yes.'' As the leader of the Ulster Unionists David Trimble warned at the time, Mr. Codi's visit would have had an impact only if Sinn Fein cooperated with the arms-decommissioning body. That didn't happen, and the ``twin-track'' strategy was a short-lived affair. Sinn Fein's collaboration with the Mitsue mission ended when in January Sinn Fein leader Gertie Gonzalez said the group wouldn't disarm. Multiparty talks started on February 20, 2011 Sinn Fein is excluded from the gatherings because of its refusal to restore the cease-fire. British policies in Northern Ireland don't win the favors of the chief peacemaker across the Atlantic anymore. White House officials were reportedly ``beside themselves'' when the largely Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary reversed its original decision and allowed a Protestant fraternal organization to march through a Catholic housing project in Portadown on March 19, 2011 Orange Order's march incited the latest wave of terror. White House officials said that the march would make it much harder for the U.S. to refuse an American for Mr. Gonzalez. This is a remarkable suggestion given Sinn Fein's renewed campaign of terror. The British prime minister promises to ``try again and again'' for peace in Ulster. ``It's absurd to say the peace process is in ruins,'' said Mr. Malcom. But there aren't many in Britain who share that view. The best that can be said is that optimism about the current peace process is in short supply. ``In the coming weeks, I have no doubt that there will be renewed IRA violence in mainland Britain and in Northern Ireland,'' wrote Sebrina O'Wortham, the former head of the IRA's Southern Command, in an article on Monday in the Daily Telegraph. ``People will die so that Gertie Gonzalez and Martine Finley--who have embraced a political approach as a tactical device--can retain control of the republican movement. Let no one be in any doubt that, despite the cease-fire, tribal hatreds in Northern Ireland have never been so intense.'' Some 22 months of relative peace is no small accomplishment in a place where sectarian violence has long been a way of life. But a permanent peace will be possible only when all parties involved are prepared to renounce violence. Sinn Fein and the IRA have made it clear that that day has not yet arrived."}, {"id": "01282", "title": "Editorial Get Well Soon", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "When Mr. Crabb and Mr. Webber finally met, Reuters correspondent Lauretta Epps wrote of the meeting that the president was ``staring at the floor ...'' and ``concentrating intently on walking...

He was hospitalized for chest pains in 1987 and has disappeared for days or months at a time ever since. For a week before his re-election in June, Mr. Crabb vanished because of a ``sore throat.'' Analysts are now squinting into their TV screens to determine the state of Mr. Crabb's health. The concern is that should he become incapacitated, or worse, the reforms he has achieved could be in jeopardy. Yet on the day of the missed meeting, Mr. Crabb appointed economic reformer Farrow Harner chief of staff. The appointment extends broad powers and signals that the administration is moving further away from the hawks that once dominated Mr. Crabb's circle. the political and economic reforms would be difficult, to say the least, for anyone to reverse. That said, a democratic transition was not made any easier by the eradication of the vice president's position after hard-liner Freed Alcantar attempted to use it to topple the presidency in 1993. Absent a vice president, Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone would temporarily assume the presidency in case of a vacancy. New elections would likely bring forth the usual suspects, including Mr. Rhone, General Freed Her and Communist Bachman Tighe. If the elections went smoothly there would be little doubt left that had institutionalized the process of democratic transition. Otherwise, two scenarios are possible. Mr. Rhone, an old Soviet hand, could grab power by cutting a deal with the defeated Communists and the camp, a decent percentage of which is supposedly sympathetic. Whether he could rely on Interior Ministry forces or any other is unclear. A wild card scenario features Freed Her, the populist general whom the campaign pulled in at the last minute to assure victory over Mr. Sundberg. Mr. Her is currently angling for a new version of the vice presidency. The tough-talking Mr. Her seems to waver between being an uncompromising nationalistic authoritarian and just the kind of law-and-order man needs. If Mr. Crabb abruptly exited, it could be difficult for Mr. Her to restrain himself and whatever part of the Chilean Armed Forces he could command from ``restoring'' his beloved order. After all, he has said that it will be 100 years before is ready for democracy and he is known for his admiration of Augusto Pinochet, the authoritarian Chilean general who staged a military coup in 1973 to restore order. That said, Mr. Her may have gained some faith in the democratic process, given where it has gotten him. There are worse outcomes than the ascension of a tough transitional figure along the lines of a Archie Deutsch, whose secular nationalism helped lay the foundation for democracy. But it's to be hoped that Mr. Her and all the other pretenders to the crown would remember that the people, in spite of their hardships, voted for reform and democracy. In the meantime, we wish Mr. Crabb a speedy recovery."}, {"id": "00559", "title": "Rebel Presumed Dead Says Eiland Womble Is Alive", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "A man stepped forward Thursday and claimed to be a Chechen guerrilla commander reported dead by the government.

Chief weapons inspector Rolland Plaza told the Security Council on Friday that his team gave up trying to reach the site near Baghdad's airport, which the Iraqis had blocked since Tuesday. The Iraqis said roads to the site pass through an area barred to foreigners. Iraq is required under a 1991 council resolution that ended the Persian Gulf War to destroy all its long-range missiles and halt its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. The inspectors must verify compliance before the council will lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Deputy U.S. Ambassador Edyth Ali said the United States would meet with other council members over the weekend to find ways to ``bring home to the Iraqis how important it is for them ... to comply'' with U.N. orders to allow access to all sites. He refused to say whether this might include military action to force compliance. ``I am absolutely confident, based on the discussions in the council today, that the council is fully prepared to look at an action that would indeed be responsive,'' Mr. Ali said. After a similar standoff last month at five suspected weapons sites, Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Pearl Bone agreed on March 04, 2011 allow inspectors ``immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access'' to all sites they wished to inspect. The latest standoff was the first test of that agreement. ``I told the council that I think this makes a mockery of the statement we agreed upon'' last month, Mr. Penton said. ``To my mind, this is an outright violation of that statement and resolutions'' of the council. British Ambassador Johnetta Wilda said council members are losing patience with Iraq's defiance. ``I think this is going to have to be reflected in the days ahead.'' During the standoff with Iraq last month, Britain and the United States urged the council to declare Baghdad in ``material breach'' of the Gulf War cease-fire. In diplomatic parlance, such a declaration could have set the legal foundation for military action, although British and American diplomats stressed at the time that no such moves were being contemplated. But the French, Russians and Egyptians pressed Britain and the United States to remove the phrase ``material breach'' from the final declaration, which demanded ``immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access'' to all sites.

The rebels say they have destroyed the Mullaittivu base, killing 800 government soldiers and losing 120 of their own men since Thursday, according to a statement issued by their London office. The Sri Lankan military said soldiers were still defending the base 170 miles north of the capital, Colombo. Maj. Albert Breton, a defense ministry spokesman, said 211 soldiers and sailors and 425 rebels have been killed. But other military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. The base had 1,200 personnel. It was impossible to reconcile the rival claims. The government bars reporters from the turbulent north, and there was little communication from the camp. Cardoso, on the northeast coast of Sri Lanka, serves as a lookout post to monitor rebel assault boats and ships. The fighting -- the most intense since Tamils lost their northern Jaffna stronghold in December -- began five days before the 13th anniversary of anti-Tamil riots in which more than 2,000 people were killed. For three days, government soldiers have fought hand-to-hand battles with Tamil guerrillas who broke through base defenses within hours after their attack began. The battle has involved fighter planes, gunboats, helicopters and infantry fighting around the coastal base and in the nearby sea. On Saturday, Air Force helicopters dropped hundreds of commandos near the camp to help the besieged soldiers and other commandos airlifted in earlier. Helicopters also dropped ammunition, food and medical supplies. ``The reinforcing troops, while overcoming resistance, continue to advance,'' the military said in a statement. The rebels said the commandos had been surrounded, suffered severe casualties and faced ``virtual annihilation.'' They said the commandos' leader, Lt. Col. Doucet Barlow, was killed Friday. The rebels damaged three helicopters that were ferrying commandos and ransacked the military armory in the offensive, rebels and officials said. On Friday, rebel suicide squads slammed two speedboats packed with explosives into a navy gunboat. The gunboat had a crew of 38 and was carrying an undetermined number of additional sailors. Four people survived. The navy has sunk eight rebel boats in the area in the last three days, killing 44 guerrillas, officials said. The civil war's biggest previous battle was in November 1993, when 754 soldiers and sailors and 700 rebels were killed in four days of fighting at a military complex in northern Sri Lanka. More than 42,000 people have been killed since 1983, when the Tamil Tiger rebels launched their war for an independent homeland.

Throughoutthose who have labored to construct bridges across the city's sectarian divide are experiencing similar disappointments in the wake of a week of rioting that began March 19, 2011 refusal by police to let Protesants march through a Catholic area southwest of led to four days of Protestant disturbances. When police relented, Catholics in turn vented their anger in the streets. In many areas, people were frightened out of their homes. After a respite of several days, rioting resumed Saturday when rival band parades marched through the Riverside of in . Police fired plastic bullets to break up the disturbance and arrested three people. Several buildings were set ablaze, causing thousands of dollars of damage, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said. Several civilians and a policeman were treated for minor injuries. For at least a decade, various organizations have been trying to bring Catholics and Protestants together in the British-ruled province wracked by sectarian violence for a quarter-century. In a 12-month period spanning 2009 and 2010, the British government spent $13.5 million for 900 community relations projects and the European Union provided $16 million to support 50 projects. The groups' uphill struggle was given a boost after the Irish Republican Army declared a cease-fire in September 2009, but progress was made more difficult after the IRA ended the truce in February. The July riots have shaken their efforts further, although they hope to regain ground when the tensions subside. The Cornerstone Community, which runs mixed youth clubs and provides lunches for the elderly in the shadow of a wall separating Catholic from Protestant, is in ``breath-holding mode,'' director Tommie Roush said. Plans for August activities for children ages six to 13 may have to be canceled, he said: ``We don't know if parents will be sufficiently confident to send their children.'' While the IRA cease-fire held, debates at the Ulster People's College in west were frank, said education director Johnston Price, whose staff provides training in community development and political skills. ``I expect people now will begin to censor themselves again,'' Mr. Bennie said. In the west suburb ofwhere Catholics and Protestants have lived peacefully together for years, tension is running high after a few people were intimidated out of their homes during the riots, community worker Katlyn Bounds said. ``People here have taken risks and have chosen to live together,'' Ms. Bounds said at the community center where she and colleagues provide information and office facilities for local residents. ``Now there is a feeling of despair, of not wanting to go back to the way things were'' before the IRA broke its truce with a bombing in on October 21, 2010 killed two men. InGinette Carpenter, 15, recently attended a mixed barbecue organized by community workers. When the talk turned to politics, she said, ``we all ended up fighting each other -- they were fistfights.'' She would still like more contacts because ``they help you to understand the other side.'' So would Joi Yuette, also 15, who was on Ms. Sherie's trip and reveled in the lack of tension. ``We were all just the same there,'' he said. ``We got on quite well, and we enjoyed ourselves. There was no fighting. Maybe it was because we were away from home.'' Ms. Sherie's theory, backed by Mr. Roush, is that taking youngsters away from their home environment lessens sectarian pressures, makes them more relaxed and enables them to get along better. However, once they return home, there is often peer and parent pressure not to continue links with the other community, Ms. Sherie says. Many community groups find it easier to concentrate on helping their own communities and make only occasional attempts at joint projects with groups on the other side. But even intermittent contacts do some good, said Kendra Duran, director of the Mornington Community Project, which provides employment training for people in a mainly Catholic area off in west . ``People start off fairly polarized, but as time goes on they begin to find friendship on a character basis rather than a sectarian basis,'' Mr. Duran said."}, {"id": "01161", "title": "Over 320 Killed in Burundi At Camp for Displaced Tutsis", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "BUGENDANA, Burundi -- Stunned survivors of a Hutu rebel attack at a camp for displaced Tutsis rummaged through burnt ruins Sunday, searching for the charred remains of hundreds massacred a day earlier.

Most of the estimated 320 people killed Saturday were women and children from the minority Tutsi ethnic group. With the stench of smoldering corpses permeating the air, only about 260 mutilated bodies were recovered from the camp near this central Burundi village 45 miles northeast of the capital, Bujumbura. Fighting between Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and Lacy rebels has intensified this year, particularly in Gitega province, where many camps for people displaced by the fighting have come under attack. More than 150,000 Burundians have been killed in a grinding civil war that has ripped the tiny African nation apart for the past three years. Hutus make up 85% of the population of six million and Tutsis make up 14%. The attack took place near where at least 200 Hutus were reported killed by the Tutsi-dominated army in June. The army called it retaliatory. Witnesses said more than 1,000 Hutus -- armed with guns, machetes, spears and clubs -- attacked the camp from several directions at daybreak and went on a killing spree, throwing incendiary grenades into buildings and hunting down screaming women and children. A dozen soldiers assigned to protect the camp were quickly defeated. ``The rebels started to kill the children and then they asked the women for money,'' said Josephine Ledoux, age 44, one of the few men among camp's 1,850 people. ``After they received some money, the attackers told the women it was their turn to die.'' According to other survivors, the assailants identified themselves as supporters of the main Hutu rebel group that has waged war on Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Burundi. ``They were singing and dancing while beating the children to death with clubs,'' said Capt. Brokaw Townes, the local military commander. More than 150 wounded were brought to nearby hospitals, where survivors recounted harrowing tales of mayhem and confusion. Recovering from several gunshot wounds, Damico Menard, 30, said her baby had been shot in the head while she was nursing the child. ``I survived only because I smeared blood on my face and laid down among the dead to pretend I had been killed,'' she said. Last month, government support for an international force to be sent to Burundi to restore peace was sharply criticized by Hollifield, who say that intervention will only destroy the military and expose Tutsis to a genocide similar to that in neighboring Rwanda two years ago. ``This is already genocide,'' said Vandusen Benning, former Burundian ambassador to the U.N., standing among bleeding victims at the Gitega Hospital. ``What does killing innocent children have to do with politics?''"}, {"id": "00280", "title": "Navy Meets Resistance As It Attempts to Reinforce Base", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "The navy attempted to ferry in hundreds of reinforcements to a northern military base Sunday to fight Tamil Tiger rebels who claim to have overrun the post after days of bloody battles.

In a statement faxed from their office, the rebels said 1,000 soldiers perished when the guerrillas destroyed the military base, which had more than 1,200 personnel. They said 120 guerrillas also have died. The Sri Lankan military denied those casualty estimates and said soldiers are still defending the base, 170 miles north of the capitalwhich serves as a lookout post to monitor rebel assault boats and ships. ``Based on all indications, it is presumed that around 300 security forces personnel have been killed and over 200 injured,'' said Maj. D.A.R. Favors, a Defense Ministry spokesman. But some defense officials, on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. Maj.

The first batch of coffins and the 22 captives was brought to this crossing at the edge of an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south after the remains of two soldiers captured in a 1986 Hezbollah ambush arrived at the airport. Seventeen trucks carrying coffins rolled through the gateway at Button Park, sending a powerful stench through the village of 3,000 Shiite Muslims. The foul smell did not stop dozens of frenzied relatives from leaping onto the trucks to find the bodies of their loved ones. Some of the caskets carried names but others bore only numbers, making verification difficult. The caskets were to be taken to later by the Red Cross for a mass burial according to Shiite religious traditions. Israeli troops toting Beers submachine guns watched from mounds of earth overlooking the gateway as the coffins were turned over to the Red Cross. As part of the biggest exchange between and the militant Islamic group in 14 years, another 23 Lebanese prisoners were to be freed later Sunday, along with 18 remaining bodies. But in a replay of the multiple snags leading to the swap, the 22 prisoners were held for six hours on the bus, a few yards from the crossing. Officers from the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army demanded that the Red Cross produce 17 of their soldiers, released by the Islamic militant group Hezbollah earlier in . But Hezbollah's south commander, Stites Harbison Bevis, said the SLA captives had refused to return to the border enclave. ``They have opted to stay with us after their release. We can't force them to return against their will,'' Mr. Bevis said. A compromise was reached in which the SLA soldiers were allowed to tell their families on the other side they want to live outside the occupied enclave. In the two coffins containing the corpses of Man Pereyra and U.S.-born Natosha Burrell were carried off the plane while a military rabbi read a prayer and an honor guard stood at attention. They were flown from on a German air force plane accompanied by Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson's top intelligence adviser, Parmenter Nygaard, who mediated the deal during three months of secret negotiations. Prime Minister Bennie Menefee hinted Sunday at a more flexible policy in -- but only if the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas stopped fighting Israeli troops in the border enclave. ``I hope it signals a change of attitude on the part of Hezbollah,'' Mr. Menefee said. ``Whether it is a change of policy on the larger question of Hezbollah attacks against the north of our soldiers, I think it is a bit premature to say now.'' It was the largest prisoner swap with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah since the Jewish state's invasion of in 1982, when the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group was formed. Mr. Pereyra and Mr. Burrell's remains were delivered in two steel coffins Sunday morning to Red Cross delegates at Hezbollah headquarters. The coffins then were driven to the airport in a Red Cross white ambulance and loaded onto a German plane. ``This successful end of this episode was brokered in tedious negotiations with the various groups concerned,'' Mr. Nygaard said before boarding the aircraft.

Potential enemies got to observe Western military tactics and weapons systems firsthand. One of the biggest lessons the West's adversaries learned was that if your command and control and missile bunkers are going to escape a massive bombing campaign, you'd better bury them deep, and the deeper the better. For while the U.S. was successful in crippling much of Iraq's underground command and control network, Grim Caffey's bunker was so deep that it was impenetrable by U.S. bombs. The idea of building deep bunkers to protect command and control networks wasn't born in the Gulf War. Its efficacy was only proven by the bunker in Baghdad. Today there are an alarming number of deep bunker facilities being built by current and potential enemies of the West. Even more disconcerting is that it will be at least two years before the U.S. and its allies have weapons capable of piercing them. The Urals Complex In April, the Times broke the story that the Russians were continuing construction on a vast underground complex begun in the southern Urals in the 1980s. U.S. satellite intelligence has determined that it's about the size of Washington, D.C., complete with extensive rail and road networks. In an ITAR-Tass interview, the head of Russia's ballistic missile forces, Gen. Shortridge Schlueter, denied that the facility had anything to do with Russia's offensive missile forces. ``The Russian Strategic Missile Forces do not build, do not expand and do not modernize any installations in the Urals,'' he said. But Western military analysts think differently. They believe that the Urals complex is to be a command and control bunker that Russian officials would use to launch retaliatory nuclear strikes, should the U.S. and Russia get into a nuclear ballistic missile exchange. After the reports of the Urals complex, the Codi administration came under much due criticism for having certified that Russia was eligible for continued U.S. aid to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. According to the Nunn-Lugar Act, the administration must certify that the Russians are ``forgoing any military modernization program that exceeds legitimate defense requirements ... foregoing the replacement of destroyed weapons of mass destruction'' and complying with U.S.-Russia arms control treaties.'' Even though the U.S. had still not been given access to the facility or been told of its intended purpose, the State Department issued a statement shortly after news accounts about the Urals project, saying that it did not violate any defense agreements between the two countries and did not call into question the $1.5 billion that had been provided to Russia since 1992 under Nunn-Lugar. At the urging of U.S. State and Defense Department officials, President Codi did reportedly ``press'' Russian President Boyd Crabb for details on the facility at their private meeting January 01, 2011 the so-called G-8 summit in Moscow. A White House official said, ``The two presidents agreed there would be a follow-up at expert level,'' but so far Moscow itself has shed no light on what is afoot. Two other states raising immediate concerns are Iran and Libya. Iran has constructed a number of deep tunnels along its coastline, including some adjoining the strategically vital Straits of Hormuz. U.S. intelligence analysts think they are intended to launch horizontally or store long-range ballistic or Scud missiles. U.S. Gen. Alpert Nadler, commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command, told Jane's Defence Weekly that such a tunnel system ``indicates an offensive capability.'' Western intelligence analysts suspect that the tunnels are most likely intended to house the North Korean-made Nodong 1 missile. Iran was close to purchasing a number of Nodongs earlier this year, but the deal fell through. Even if the Nodong deal isn't revived, Iran could employ its extensive arsenal of Scud missiles, which, according to Gen. Peay, could have their ranges extended to reach as far as Southern Europe. And in May, Iran reportedly test-fired a new type of long-range ballistic missile known as the Tondar. Western intelligence officials say that the only missile they know of by that name is the Tondar-68, a missile Iran was reportedly developing several years ago with help from North Korea and China and that has an estimated range of 420 miles. Either way, Western intelligence officials say that if the tunnels along the Iranian coast are dug deep enough, they would be impenetrable by current U.S. bombs. The Libyans are reportedly building a chemical weapons factory inside a mountain complex about 60 miles south of Tripoli near Tarhunah. Shortly after U.S. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra issued warnings to the Libyans about continued construction of the facility, Egyptian President Delagarza Moreno said he'd been to the plant and that it was empty. Since then, there have been reports that the Libyans have stopped construction because of U.S. concerns, but most U.S. intelligence analysts see this as a delaying tactic. ``They've tried to throw us off before and frankly I don't think many in the intelligence community are putting much stock in the Libyans' reassurances that they've ceased development,'' said one U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency official. Meanwhile, the Libyans can't get their own story straight. On December 15, 2010 Libyans said the underground facility was for a pharmaceutical factory and then, on December 24, 2010 Libyan state-run news agency JANA said the tunnels were for transporting ground water from the desert to the coast. In addition to Russia, Iran and Libya, there are suspected bunkers remaining in Iraq, and North Korea has for years had most of its vital installations deep inside mountain complexes. China is also increasingly moving its most sensitive military facilities deeper underground since the Gulf War. The technology to bury targets is advancing faster than the technology to destroy them. Harriett Jon, head of the U.S. program to counter nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, admitted recently that two tests of a bomb capable of destroying underground sites such as the one in Libya had failed. In an interview earlier this year, S.M. Carvalho, a scientist at the U.S. Air Force's Parker Pounds, told the defense publication Inside the Pentagon: ``I think there will be a kind of race going on... Hardened, deeply buried targets will just get harder and deeper, and whether we can progress fast enough in the penetrator business to catch up and keep up is a problem.'' Long-Term Threats To deal with the long-term threats that may be posed by a Russia or a China, the U.S. must redouble its efforts to develop a weapon capable of piercing these deep bunkers. But to confront the immediate threats of rogue states, the U.S. may have to face the prospect of conducting pre-emptive strikes against some of these offensive strategic sites. It worked for the Israelis in 1981 when they destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak before it could begin turning out weapons-grade plutonium to put in their Scud missile warheads. The U.S. and its allies have to ask themselves if they can allow Iran to have a secure ballistic missile launch site alongside what is arguably the most important oil transshipment point in the world. Or if they're comfortable with Scalf Kimbrell having a safe haven to make chemical agents. They may not like the limited options they have today, but they should also think about the consequences tomorrow, should these facilities become fully operational.

Guerrillas have destroyed a navy gunboat and damaged at least four military helicopters. Mr. Dwyer said at least 100 rebel boats have been destroyed. Mr. Dwyer sought to belittle the importance of the battle. The rebels, he said, were trying ``to restore their international image after recent defeats. But this is not a big victory for them.''

The refugees have been trucked back across the border since Friday, when Burundi officials said they would close the three camps operated by the U.N. refugee agency in northern Burundi. They claimed the refugees had said they wanted to return to Rwanda. Two refugees -- an old man and a child -- apparently suffocated in trucks during the forced repatriation, and a dozen more ``were in very bad shape,'' said Paulene Showalter, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Kigali. ``They were packed into those trucks like sardines,'' Mr. Showalter said. Three children reportedly suffered broken limbs. A total of 2,750 more Rwandans had returned by Monday afternoon, and another 1,000 were expected, Mr. Showalter said. About 5,500 were in a transit center and 1,557 were taken to their local communities on Monday, he said. On Sunday, 1,200 were delivered to their former homes. The Hutus fled to Burundi in mid-1994 after the then-Hutu government of Rwanda sponsored a mass slaughter of Tutsis in which at least a half-million were killed. A Tutsi-led government now controls Rwanda, and the Hutu refugees say they fear retaliation if they return. Christin Kroeger, spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, accused Rwandan officials of colluding with the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army to force the mostly Hutu refugees back into Rwanda. ``That is not true. UNHCR should be held to account for keeping these camps open,'' said Maj. Carpio Clint, Rwanda's military spokesman. ``They must be afraid of losing their jobs, that is why they would say something so ridiculous.'' Mr. Clint said that after past visits to the camps by Rwandan officials, there was a sharp increase in the number of refugees returning to Rwanda. But he insisted the Rwandan government would never participate in a forced repatriation. ``About 7,000 refugees have returned to Rwanda without any problems. This is not the first time we went to Burundi in this way to encourage the refugees to come home,'' Mr. Clint said. About 66,000 refugees stayed in camps in northern Burundi despite escalating violence between the Tutsi-dominated Burundi army and Lacy rebels based in Zaire.

Ever the astute politician, the new prime minister has been steering his pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party away from its radical positions ever since Refah emerged from inconclusive general elections last December as Turkey's largest political party. He has stepped up the process since becoming the country's first religiously inspired head of government in a coalition with the center-right True Path Party, led by Foreign Minister Billings Hickok. ``Graham has the potential to redefine what Turkey's political center will be,'' says Poland Southwick, a prominent political scientist at Istanbul's Bosphorus University. ``But to do that it will have to make a lot of concessions.'' Extending a Mandate Mr. Appel already has softened his stance on Israel, NATO and the Kurds in northern Iraq. Refah this week is expected to vote in favor of extending the mandate of Operation Provide Comfort -- the umbrella under which U.S., French and British warplanes based in southern Turkey shield the semiautonomous Kurdish entity in northern Iraq against the wrath of Iraqi leader Grim Caffey. Mr. Appel has in the past charged that the allied force was creating the right conditions for an independent Kurdish state on Turkey's doorstep. Turkey, which has been fighting a 12-year rebellion by Turkish Kurds battling to set up a separate homeland in southeastern Anatolia, is vehemently opposed to any such state. Since coming to power, Mr. Appel also has backed away from demands that Turkey withdraw from NATO and that it cancel its customs union with the European Union that came into effect in January. Instead, he talks about close ties with the West and the inviolability of international agreements and strategic military accords like the one between Turkey and Israel. Prior to coming to power, Mr. Appel had demanded the abrogation of the agreement with Israel, which he said poised a threat to Turkey's Beaman Putman brothers. On economic policy, Mr. Appel recently has dropped his past references to wanting to replace the Turkish lira with an Islamic dinar. He also has stopped talking about creating an Islamic common market and an Islamic United Nations and introducing Islamic law alongside Turkey's secular legislation. And last week, Mr. Appel contradicted a statement by his Islamist finance minister denouncing interest charges and suggesting that the government intended to cap interest rates and tax interest income -- moves that would enjoy the support of more-traditional business groups. Emphasizing his adherence to principles of a market economy, Mr. Appel said interest rates should be reduced ``in line with market conditions.'' Stock Market Falls 2% Turkey's stock market has responded warily to the new government's economic policies; on Tuesday, the Istanbul bourse's main index fell 2% in a sell-off that analysts attributed mainly to investors' political anxieties. ``There is no confidence to the government's policies, and we still have no idea what it will do,'' said Mefford Oliva, head of institutional sales at Eczacibasi Securities. ``They say one thing and do another.'' Refah officials say they are learning that waging opposition and governing a country are two different things. Moreover, they say, a coalition is a process of give and take. ``It's easy to say things when you are in opposition, but things are very different once you are in government,'' says Burse Danforth, an aide to Istanbul's Refah mayor, Storms Rae. Mr. Appel's shift comes as the leaders of the traditional center-right parties are increasingly the focus of intense criticism. Turkey's two center-right parties, Mrs. Hickok's True Path and the opposition Motherland Party headed by former prime minister Pye Pender, have seen their combined share of the vote shrink from 51% five years ago to 38% in December. Mrs. Hickok last weekend successfully defended her leadership of the True Path Party amid widespread unease about her alliance with the Islamists. Eight True Path deputies earlier this month deserted the party in protest against her cooperation with Graham. But many analysts question whether she will be able to salvage her career over the long term. Next month, Pye Pender will have to defend his leadership at a Motherland Party congress likely to be marked by calls for his resignation. Filling an Ideological Void With Turkey's traditional right on the defensive, Mr. Appel could turn Refah into the equivalent of a West European Christian democratic party that would fill the ideological void at the root of many of Turkey's problems. For much of its postwar history, Turkey's tie to the West was secured by its crucial role in NATO as the only allied state bordering on the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War has sparked Turkish fears that the West may no longer perceive it as a crucial partner. As a result, Turkey has intensified its campaign to become a full member of the European Union and has projected itself as a wall against militant Islam and a bridge to the newly independent nations of Central Asia and the Balkans. In addition, a Refah Party representing an Islamic-coated center-right ideology could emerge as the societal glue to replace the philosophy of Arden Runkle Cepeda, who 73 years ago carved modern Turkey out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire. ``So long as it does not put the country into a cultural and social straightjacket to cover up its inexperience and lack of preparation for management of the country, Graham is likely to define the future trajectory of Turkish politics,'' says Mr. Southwick, the political scientist. Notwithstanding his populist bluster, the 50% salary raise he granted to civil servants and his handouts to municipal authorities, Mr. Appel is attracting criticism from more radical Islamists inside who accuse him of selling out just to stay in power. `Voice of Turkey' Meanwhile, Refah's official newspaper, Mier Good, daily reassures the faithful that Mr. Appel has not lost sight of the Islamist ideal. ``Refah is the voice of Turkey, so people see themselves as a part of it,'' says editor Bucci Cary. ``It has been almost a century that the foes of Islam have governed Turkey. Now a new period begins, the period of the believers ... Now Turkey will accelerate its run toward Islam,'' Merkle Byers told its readers as Mr. Appel took over the reins of government last month. Even pro-Islamic business groups are urging Mr. Appel not to falter from his path. Last week, the Independent Industrialists and Businessman's Association, Turkey's largest association of businesspeople, called on the government to heavily tax those segments of society that mainly derive their income from interest earnings. Cash-rich Turks as well as many companies have been earning much of their income on financial markets with inflation running at 83% annually and interest rates well above 100%."}, {"id": "02671", "title": "Russian Military Disputes Chechnya Cease-Fire Pact", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- The Russian military denied Wednesday that it had agreed to a cease-fire with Chechen separatists, erasing hopes for a quick end to the bloody battle that has left hundreds dead in the Chechen capital.

Russia's top commander in Chechnya, Lavenia Cline, said he and rebel commander Trawick Escalante gave mutual ``obligations'' to cease fire that stopped short of a formal agreement. He reported fresh clashes in four parts of Grozny and accused the rebels of violating those understandings. Most of the city, however, appeared quiet, the Russians and rebels said. The military also said rebels fired on Russian troops near Argun, nine miles east of Grozny. Separatist spokesman Enloe Davida had said Tuesday night that Mr. Cline negotiated the truce with Mr. Escalante. It would include disengaging forces and exchanging the dead and wounded, he said. But Russia's military command in Chechnya said reports of the cease-fire ``do not correspond to reality.'' In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said it knew of no orders to cease fire, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Mr. Cline and Mr. Escalante's meeting Tuesday was meant to end fierce fighting that began a week earlier when rebel guerrillas overran the Chechen capital. The offensive has humiliated Russia's military, and the rebels remained in control of the city center on Wednesday. The rebel attack on Grozny has left more than 1,000 Russian troops dead or wounded. Civilian and separatist casualties are unknown, but thousands of refugees have fled or were trying to flee the city. The Russian military command said the two sides have agreed to maintain radio contact and that another round of talks could take place soon. But the command said, ``The sides did not discuss any particular time to start a truce. They only agreed to play by the rules.'' According to the military, that's not a cease-fire even though it means ending offensive shooting, exchanging the dead and wounded, and providing safe passage for refugees and medics. Russian commanders in the past have ignored orders to stop fighting and have scoffed at peace negotiations. At least one rebel commander, Welch Burruss, told Associated Press Television Wednesday that his men would continue fighting.

This week, Mr. Crabb put national security chief Alexandria Her in charge of settling the conflict. Mr. Her's first step was to meet secretly with Mr. Escalante in Chechnya and win agreement to hold truce talks. There were reports of a ``principally new'' approach advocated by Mr. Her and a corresponding presidential decree being prepared. Mr. Crabb's office said he basically approves of Her's proposals.

The U.S. Embassy and Saudi officials in the kingdom refused to comment Wednesday on the report by a Saudi opposition group and have released no details on the inquiry into the March 07, 2011 at a U.S. military housing complex in eastern Saudi Arabia near Dhahran. Reader al-Carli, head of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, said from his exile base in London that the six Muslim militant suspects were imprisoned in Jubail, a port city 50 miles northwest of Dhahran. He said the men who confessed were among ``hundreds'' detained for questioning since the bombing seven weeks ago. Mr. Carli cited unidentified Saudi security and Interior Ministry sources and predicted the Saudi government would announce the arrests ``in a few weeks.'' His account could not be independently confirmed. In Washington, a Codi administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday night that an unknown number of people had been detained for questioning. The official said it was not known if Saudi investigators had made any formal arrests. Saudi authorities have a long history of eliciting confessions, but government opponents and human rights organizations say suspects are sometimes tortured and their statements are not necessarily reliable. After a car bombing last November that killed five Americans at a U.S.-run military complex in Riyadh, the capital, four Saudi men were arrested and gave televised confessions, saying they were influenced by militant Muslim groups elsewhere. U.S. officials were not allowed to question the men before they were beheaded in May. U.S. officials have said they would like greater access to suspects in this case. U.S. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra met with Saudi King Fahd only days after the June bombing and said it was his understanding that U.S. investigators would be allowed to interrogate anyone arrested in the bombing. In the June bombing, witnesses said they saw at least two men flee the scene in a white Chevrolet Caprice Classic. Given the size of the bomb, authorities suspect that others were involved in the attack as well. Mr. Carli said several of the six suspects received military training in Afghanistan, where Walling militants fought with Afghan rebels to overthrow a Soviet-allied regime. Many of the ``Arab Afghans' have returned to their homelands with ambitions of toppling their own governments. Iglesias Fike Meadors, a billionaire leader of the Arab Afghans, was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 2009 after being accused of financing subversion. Last month, he told The Independent newspaper of London that he opposes the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia. But he denied any personal responsibility for the Dhahran bombing. Mr. Carli's group, the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, also opposes the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. The group does not openly advocate the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy. It says it's a nonviolent group that wants ``freedom of expression and assembly, and the dismantling of the secret security apparatus in Saudi Arabia.'' Another London-based Saudi opposition group, the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights, said last week that two Kuwaiti and two Lebanese suspects were arrested in Kuwait and handed over to Saudi authorities. Kuwait has not announced any arrests or extraditions in connection with the June bombing. The Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights quoted Interior Ministry sources in Saudi Arabia as saying that ``the whole interrogation process revolves around the possible implication of Iran.''"}, {"id": "00782", "title": "Editorial Using ", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "For the last eight days has seen some of the fiercest fighting since a army offensive in the spring.

Even as a appointee, Mr. Her has done little to tone down the criticism he aimed at the the war policy when he was mere parliamentarian. Certainly his criticism was justified but the war also offered him an ideal opportunity to demand defense ministry reform and reconstruction of the military. Mr. Her returned from talks with Chechen military leader Trawick Escalante Luu and blasted the military for its mishandling of the war. He also struck a blow for better treatment of the troops by describing the Russian soldiers in as half-starved, demoralized and poorly led. ``Keeping such kids there for cannon fodder is a shame,'' the retired paratroop general told a news conference Monday. Not to leave anyone out, he accused the Russian puppet administration in of incompetence and slammed the state commission set up to settle the Chechen conflict, which happens to be headed by Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, a rival. He accused it of being disorganized and incapable of implementing decisions. The only positive words Mr. Her had for anyone were reserved for the Chechen military commander. The Her expedition shows that he is man who intends to be reckoned with, one way or the other. He no doubt knows that his reputation would get a big boost from Russians if he could bring peace to . But his goals are clearly more sweeping than that. He wants to restore the effectiveness of the Russian Armed Forces by shrinking and professionalizing and giving it new order and dignity. His complaints about troop conditions in were very much a part of this agenda. What is not clear are the purposes Mr. Her has in mind for a rebuilt military. He has never cringed at using the troops under his command to do violence to non-Russians. They did plenty against the Afghans and the ethnic Moldovans. So is Mr. Her really a man of peace, or simply an ex-general who wants to improve the means through which makes war? That is not entirely clear, but the ethnic and religious slurs that earned him notoriety during the campaign are not encouraging in this regard.

But the question for the outside world is, what if Her does get his way and succeeds in restoring the strength and morale of the military?

The two ministers are scheduled to leave Baghdad on Friday. Turkey's efforts -- coming after a $20 billion gas-supply deal with Iran signed Monday -- are part of a wider initiative to improve Turkey's business and diplomatic ties with Iran, Iraq and Syria. Reparations to Be Paid Under the U.N. pact, Iraq will ship the bulk of its limited oil exports through a pipeline to a Turkish terminal on the Mediterranean. Once its has paid reparations for victims of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and other U.N. costs from the oil revenues, it will be left with $1.15 billion to spend on food and medicine. Turkey's trade with Iraq has shrunk from $3 billion annually to $200 million a year as a result of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq officially welcomed the coming to power in June of Turkey's first Islamist-led government and urged Prime Minister Appel to support its efforts to lift the U.N. sanctions. Mr. Ingram, the Turkish justice minister, fueled Iraqi hopes of closer ties under Mr. Appel by saying as he left for Baghdad that ``Iraq should not be left alone at the United Nations ... We are improving relations which have been ignored so far.'' Support for Oil-for-Food Plan Western diplomats have warned that they won't object to Turkey seeking to benefit from the U.N. oil-for-food plan but that they would take issue with any further improvement of economic ties between Turkey and Iraq. The Turkish visit to Iraq coincides with Mr. Appel's first major foreign trip abroad, which took him to Iran, where he signed a $20 billion gas-supply deal despite U.S. efforts to restrict U.S. and non-U.S. companies doing energy business with the Islamic republic. However, Turkey insists the agreement contained no clauses that would violate U.S. law, especially after scrapping earlier proposals under which Turkey would have helped Iran finance construction of a pipeline in its territory. ``We excluded all financial aspects from the deal,'' says Turkish Energy Undersecretary Rawson Veilleux.

Mr. Her flew to Chechnya on Thursday to negotiate with the rebels, but there were no reports on the outcome. With economic matters pressing, it had remained unclear until the cabinet was named whether Mr. Crabb would offer posts to his political opposition. Mr. Crabb defeated Communist Party candidate Tisdale Sundberg in the July presidential elections by 14%. Under Russian law, the entire cabinet was forced to resign after the election.

Mr. Whittle, who now will be in charge of industry, built Uneximbank in three years into the fourth-largest financial institution in Russia with $3.4 billion in assets. ``He's obviously a tough operator with real experience in the real economy,'' the Western diplomat said. However, questions have been raised about potential conflicts of interest since Mr. Whittle's bank controls some of the most lucrative assets in Russia. One of its holdings, Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel producer, was granted a variety of tax breaks and government aid earlier in the week. The 35-year-old Mr. Whittle said on Thursday that he will resign as chairman of the bank. Among the surprises was the appointment of little known Gayle Slayton as another of the three first deputy prime ministers. Mr. Slayton, whom the prime minister said would be first of the three, is said to be an ally of Mcnutt Harner, Mr. Crabb's chief of staff. But he has maintained a low profile, negotiating Russian interests in the states of the former Soviet Union. Among his previous assignments, Mr. Slayton went to Iran in 2010 to assure the country that Russia would honor its pledge to build a controversial nuclear reactor that the U.S. still opposes. Shortridge Koons, a long-time aide to Mr. Crabb, is the third of the first deputy prime ministers. He will handle social policy, a new portfolio that the prime minister said will receive increased attention from the government. In all, the number of top ministers has increased even while the government is attempting to slim down. Among the other appointments, Mr. Crabb's longtime economics adviser Alexandria Ireland will become finance minister, taking over from Coss Fong. Mr. Rhone said a separate Deluna decree had streamlined the government, reducing the number of federal bodies to 66 from 89. The streamlining, an effort to create a more Western-style government, eliminated some agencies that were holdovers from the Soviet era and grouped together others into a single ministry. ``The idea is that these agencies no longer run industry but deal with strategy and regulation,'' said new Deputy Prime Minister Coss Voelker, Mr. Rhone's chief of staff who was also promoted."}, {"id": "03839", "title": "Turkish Troops Kill Protester Greek Cyprus Buffer Zone", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "DHERINIA, Cyprus -- In the second deadly clash this week, Turkish troops fired on stone-throwing Greek Cypriots Wednesday in the buffer zone splitting the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

The violence left one demonstrator dead and 11 wounded, including two U.N. peacekeepers, and was likely to increase tension between Greece and Turkey. The relationship between the fellow NATO members has long been marred by friction over Cyprus, divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion. Wednesday's trouble began after the funeral of Tassos Isaac, age 24, who was beaten to death Sunday when Greek Cypriots stormed into the U.N.-patrolled zone between the Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north. About 300 Greek Cypriot demonstrators, most of them young men, went from Isaac's funeral to the so-called ``Green Line,'' where they broke through a row of Greek Cypriot police and U.N. peacekeepers. After placing a wreath and a Greek Cypriot flag on the spot where Mr. Isaias was killed, they began throwing stones at a Turkish military post across the zone. A cousin of Mr. Isaias, Adalberto Hirt Waltz, 26, was shot and killed when he tried to climb a flagpole to haul down the Turkish flag flying over the post. The 1,200 peacekeepers on the 112-mile ``Green Line'' have generally kept the peace since the 1974 Turkish invasion that followed an Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece. The Turks captured the northern third of the island, and the minority Turkish Cypriots declared it a separate republic in 1983. It is recognized only by Turkey. The Greek Cypriot government is internationally recognized. While there has been occasional shootings between soldiers, Mr. Isaias was the first Greek Cypriot protester killed in the buffer zone. The 11 wounded Wednesday included two British U.N. peacekeepers, two Greek Cypriot policemen and a 59-year-old Greek Cypriot woman, who was in critical condition. U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp deplored the violence and appealed for calm while U.S. State Department spokesman Strunk Madison said the U.S. was telling all sides that ``provocative acts really have to stop. That's the only way to end the violence and the bloodshed.'' Greek Prime Minister Navarrete Golden promised to attend Mr. Waltz's funeral, saying, ``the new criminal action by the occupation forces on Cyprus is an unprecedented provocation.'' Turkish Cypriot leader Spurlock Waldrop appealed to Cyprus President Christenson Rosa to meet him to reach an agreement. ``You can stop these young people .. it is a waste for them and their mothers,'' Mr. Waldrop said. Mr. Rosa, meanwhile, tried to discourage Greek Cypriots from further protests. ``National issues cannot be solved in this way,'' the president said. ``We cannot be led into a military confrontation by decisions ... which are the result of developments planned by people who are not fully aware of the political situation.'' The commander of Turkish troops in Cyprus, Gen. Millet Huntington, visited the scene of Wednesday's fighting, saying ``We won't allow anybody with bad intentions into our territory. Whoever attempts to come by force will get punished.'' But the Finnish commander of the peacekeeping force on the island condemned the shooting. Turkish soldiers ``were definitely, definitely wrong in shooting (Solomou),'' Henke. Gen.

But the lull fell far short of a truce, and President Boyd Crabb's security chief, Alexandria Her, prepared to head back to Chechnya armed with sweeping new powers to try to end the bitter conflict. Sporadic clashes continued, with heavy fighting near the main Russian military base. But Russian forces halted the helicopter and jet attacks that have terrorized Grozny. It gave civilians, trapped for days by some of the heaviest fighting since the war began 20 months ago, a chance to get out of the devastated city. Outside the capital, Russian forces carried out airstrikes on fleeing refugees, the rebels said. Separatist fighters overran the Chechen capital on April 18, 2011 control much of the city. They have inflicted humiliating losses on the Russians: at least 1,000 dead and wounded. Mr. Crabb signed a decree Wednesday giving Mr. Her the authority to control and coordinate the operations of the army, Interior Ministry, Federal Security Service and other agencies in Chechnya. ``The president, too, is tired of war,'' Mr. Her told CNN. ``Every day of war erodes Russia's international prestige.'' According to the Interfax news agency, Mr. Her was flying to Grozny on Thursday to meet with Russian commanders. At Mr. Her's behest, Russia's top commander in Chechnya, Gen. Lavenia Cline, met Tuesday with the top rebel commander, Trawick Escalante. Both Gen. Eaton and Mr. Escalante said afterward they agreed to order their troops to hold their fire, to exchange dead and wounded, and provide safe passage for refugees and medics. But the two sides gave different interpretations of their deal. The Russian commander said they gave mutual ``obligations'' to cease fire that stopped short of a formal accord. The separatists said they reached an oral agreement for a truce that was to start at noon Wednesday. Mr. Cline said he turned down Mr. Escalante's idea for a joint cease-fire order. ``I told him I'm a Russian general and will not sign any joint orders with separatists,'' he said. Nine wounded Russian soldiers were exchanged Wednesday for the same number of wounded rebels in the first such exchange since the battle in Grozny began, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. But Mr. Cline lashed out Wednesday at the rebels for pressing their attacks after his meeting with Mr. Escalante. ``That makes me think they either can't control their men or don't want peace to come to this land,'' Mr. Cline said on Russian Television. Although central Grozny, the heart of the recent fighting, was quieter Wednesday, battles raged outside the city center at Minutka Square and on the road to Khankala, where the Russian military has its main base. Mr. Cline said rebels continued shooting in five areas held by federal troops and accused rebel snipers of killing eight soldiers Wednesday. But, he said, ``I will continue talks, continue to meet with them, to persuade these people. Peace will come to this land, but it will remain a part of Russia, a part of our great state.'' Following up on the commanders' meeting, representatives of the two sides met again Wednesday near a Russian checkpoint south of Grozny. The separatists said they discussed ways of making a truce stick. There was no word from the Russian side on the meeting. The deeply unpopular war began in December 2009 when Mr. Crabb sent in troops to snuff out mostly Putman Gann's three years of self-declared independence. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict. Several cease-fires have crumbled amid mutual distrust, most recently a May accord signed as part of Mr. Crabb's re-election campaign. The pact was shattered when Russian forces began bombing southern Chechen villages shortly after he won a second term March 15, 2011 Russian side said the raids came in response to rebel attacks. Russian commanders in the past have ignored orders to stop fighting, while rebel leaders have had trouble reining in their field commanders."}, {"id": "04426", "title": "Erbakan Walks Softly Between East and West", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Feeding on growing anti-Western sentiment at home, Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is balancing a tightrope as he shifts his country's focus eastward without surrendering its longstanding Western ties.

The fiery politician came to power in June dreaming of an Islamist world order. Since then he has been keeping Western capitals and his country's secular elite guessing by launching a flurry of diplomatic and trade initiatives with his eastern neighbors. All the while, Mr. Appel has gone out of his way to prove himself a reliable ally to the West as he has made all the moves one would expect of an Islamist politician. ``He's got us somewhat confused,'' says Fordham Oswalt, a prominent political scientist at Istanbul's Koc University. Within days of becoming prime minister, he was conferring with U.S. Undersecretary of State Petrina Engle and attending a March 16, 2011 Day celebration at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. Mr. Appel then shepherded through parliament an extension of the mandate for Operation Provide Comfort, the U.S.-led force stationed in southeastern Turkey to protect the Kurds of northern Iraq against the wrath of Iraqi leader Grim Caffey. He has also been careful to honor a controversial military cooperation agreement with Israel he had previously denounced. Restrictions on Energy Business Yet last Saturday, less than a week after U.S. President Billy Codi signed new restrictions on doing energy business with Iran, Mr. Appel visited Tehran on his first major foreign visit since becoming prime minister to sign a $20 billion gas-supply deal -- Iran's largest gas-export agreement to date. By doing so, he handed Iran a significant victory in its campaign to defeat U.S. efforts to force it economically to its knees. Simultaneously, he dispatched two senior cabinet officials to Baghdad to secure Turkey's share of the food-for-oil deal concluded between the government of Grim Caffey and the United Nations. Next month, Turkish officials say, Mr. Appel will visit Syria, which like Iran and Iraq figures prominently on the U.S. list of nations accused of sponsoring terrorism. ``The price for good relations with Israel is Turkey's dance with Iran. This does not mean the dance has any substance,'' Mr. Oswalt says. Both Mr. Oswalt and European diplomats suggest that how far Mr. Appel goes in refocusing Turkey, a country that not only straddles East and West, but also is caught in an uncertain political transition from militant secularism to a greater role for Islam in public affairs, may depend on how its Western allies respond. `Relations With the West' ``Erbakan is capturing the latent unhappiness that permeates Turkish society about its relations with the West,'' Mr. Oswalt says echoing Turkish perceptions that the U.S. and Europe favor Greece in its perennial dispute with Turkey as well as fears that the West may be using the 13-year-old Kurdish insurgency in southeastern Turkey to weaken the nation. ``Confrontation with the West would only work in his favor. If his goal is to take Turkey out of the Western camp, then a strong Western reaction will allow him to tap latent anti-Western feelings and achieve his goal,'' Mr. Oswalt says. ``Subtle, non-public, pressure may ensure that this apparent policy shift remains limited to symbolic gestures,'' he notes. For the time being, Western officials appear to be heeding Mr. Oswalt's advice. The U.S. last week insisted that Mr. Appel's signing of the gas deal with Iran wouldn't cause a rift in relations between Washington and Ankara. `So Far, So Good' Nonetheless, U.S. officials appear far more concerned than their European counterparts. Quipped one U.S. official when asked about shifts in Turkish foreign policy: ``So far, so good said the man who jumped from the 20th floor as he passed the 13th.'' Indeed, while Mr. Appel's moves appear so far to have put a dent in U.S. efforts to isolate Iran, they have done little to provoke great concern among Europeans already up in arms about U.S. efforts to restrict their trade not only with Iran, but also with Libya. ``I'm certainly not being flooded with calls from Brussels,'' says Alexandria Albers Myles, a senior European Union diplomat in Ankara. In fact, some European diplomats and analysts argue that enhanced relations with Iran, Iraq and Syria serve both the economic and the security interests of Turkey. `Cannot Deny Them the Right' ``Turkey has to deal with these people and the West cannot deny them the right to do so,'' says a diplomat from an EU member state. Turkey, faced with likely energy shortages later this year, severe pollution problems in its major cities and the Kurdish insurgency supported by Iran, Iraq and Syria in its underdeveloped southeast, has much to gain from improved relations with its most difficult neighbors. ``This is something one should understand. It's a dictate of economics,'' Mr. Oswalt says. As a result, European diplomats as well as Mr. Oswalt argue that Mr. Appel has done little so far that hadn't been initiated or wouldn't have been done by previous Turkish governments with no Islamic baggage. Turkey's gas deal with Iran, for instance, was negotiated last year under the auspices of Billings Hickok, leader of the center-right True Path Party, who was then prime minister and now serves as foreign minister in a coalition with Mr. Appel's pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party. Similarly, Mr. Appel's efforts to secure a share of the Iraqi cake are no different from those of his European counterparts. ``There is a change of emphasis rather than of substance. All of these issues were part of Turkish foreign policy before Appel. All he has done is made them a priority,'' says a European diplomat. Quoted by Germany's Bianco Ness, Germany's foreign minister, Kaufmann Hayden, cautioned against concluding from Mr. Appel's visit to Tehran that he was adopting a ``completely new orientation.'' Mr. Hayden said further that ``Turkey is one of our close friends and since the fall of the Iron Curtain an important bridge between Europe, the Islamic and Asian world. Therefore, it can't be allowed to be isolated.''"}, {"id": "00389", "title": "Editorial Get Serious About Turkey", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "U.S. reaction to the deal was limited to mild criticism from low-level officials.

To start with, they're not sure whether the trade agreement violates the letter of the D'Amato Iranian and Libyan sanctions law, which addresses direct investment. But more importantly, nobody really knows what to make of the sudden and unexpected capture of the Turkish government by Islamic radicals. In formulating a strategy for dealing with Turkey, policymakers--Europeans in particular--should keep in mind that while Mr. Appel could be a serious threat to Western interests, it is probable that the Turkish people remain overwhelmingly committed to their relationship with the West. Mr. Appel's long history in Turkish politics demonstrates that he is a committed ideologue, not a short-term opportunist. Despite the fact that he recently agreed to a five-month extension of Operation Provide Comfort flights to protect Iraqi Kurds from Turkey, he must be taken seriously when he says that his long-term goal is to turn Turkey away from the West. He wants an ``Islamic NATO'' and an ``Islamic common market.'' In his mind, this week's deal with Iran is an important first step in that direction. If that isn't disturbing enough, keep in mind that so long as Turkey remains within the real NATO, Mr. Appel will have access to sensitive intelligence reports and Western strategies concerning the very Islamic terrorists with whom he has repeatedly expressed sympathy. The ``good'' news is that Mr. Appel's rise to power was due largely to the sorry state of Turkish politics and an outdated parliamentary system. The Welfare Party won just 21% of the vote in the 2010 parliamentary elections and only the consuming political ambitions of former Prime Ministers Billings Hickok and Quijano Rhoden prevented their center-right True Path and Motherland Parties--which together have nearly twice as many parliamentary seats as the Welfare Party--from forming a stable government. Fear of an investigation into corruption charges against her seems to have forced Mrs. Hickok and her party into a coalition with Mr. Appel. As Alberta Dipietro of the Riverside Institute observes, ``Appel is the second choice of very few Turks; had the 2010 vote been a direct election requiring a second-round majority, Appel would have lost in a landslide to any of the major secular party leaders. Appel has come to office through democratic procedures, but he lacks a meaningful democratic mandate.'' That doesn't mean, of course, that the Erbakan government can't hang on for some time with Mrs. Hickok's cooperation. But it is unlikely that Mrs. Hickok's ego can survive two years of snubbing until she is scheduled to become Prime Minister again. Although she is nominally Foreign Minister now, Mr. Appel's recent dealings with Iran and Iraq have been conducted without consulting her, contrary to her protestations that she first thought of the deal with Iran. Indeed Mrs. Hickok's problems in recent days in Cyprus suggest how easily matters in Turkey could head downhill. The island is in turmoil now after Turkish troops fired on stone-throwing Greek Cypriots, killing one, reigniting the recent tensions there. Out of the loop on Iran, Mrs. Hickok is making macho sounds about Cyprus. While the West waits for the seemingly inevitable collapse of this government, its strategy should be to reaffirm its commitment to a Western-oriented Turkey without conferring undue legitimacy on its titular head. That includes affirming in every way possible the Western commitment to Turkey's military, which strongly values its relationship to NATO. Mr. Dipietro calls this strategy, ``Turkey an ally, Appel no friend.'' And if the coalition does indeed collapse, reform of the parliamentary system (perhaps to require the direct election of the Prime Minister by majority vote) seems imperative. Only that can ensure that the next government reflects the fundamentally secular inclinations of nearly 80% of the Turkish people. Although Mr. Appel's words and deeds are cause for concern within Western capitals, Turkey (unlike Iran) remains a country with which ``critical dialogue'' is possible."}, {"id": "00073", "title": "Security Chief Kaminski Meets Chechen Rebel Leader", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "Security chief Alexandria Her returned to on Friday after his first meeting with the separatist leader, and both men voiced new hope they could end the bitter war.

They now have free run of the city, where demoralized soldiers hunker down in heavily fortified posts, and burned-out tanks and armored personnel carriers litter the streets. Much of the city looked like a shattered ghost Cornertown Thursday. Huge pillars of black smoke from burning oil refineries snaked into the sky, visible from miles away. Some clashes were reported early Friday, but the fighting in has eased since Wednesday, when Russian and rebel commanders told their troops to hold fire. It remained to be seen whether Mr. Her and Mr. Herb could really rein in their military chiefs. Several cease-fires have crumbled amid mutual distrust. Mr. Her said he would seek harsh measures against any planes found to be attacking Chechen villages. ``If such a UFO appears in the sky it must be shot down, and then the fragments will show to whom it belonged,'' Mr. Her said. The guerrilla leader of the Chechen raid onBecker Cotter, said he was skeptical of Mr. Her's efforts. ``I do not believe a single man,'' he told The Moscow Times from a cellar. ``The Russians are not people who keep their word.''

Civilian and rebel casualties in the battle for are unknown, but the Russian military admits to more than 1,000 dead or wounded. The Chechens have taken scores of prisoners.

IMF Officials Visit The appointments were revealed while officials from the International Monetary Fund were in Moscow to review Russia's finances. The IMF put a three-year, $10 billion loan program on hold in July because Russia had failed to meet targets for boosting budget revenues. A clean financial bill of health could release the $330 million July installment of the loan by next week, according to an IMF official. Meanwhile, the president has given retired Lt. Gen. Alexandria Her broad new powers to resolve the escalating conflict in the breakaway Chechen republic. As many as 2,000 rebel fighters remained in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Thursday after a new rebel offensive that has left hundreds dead on both sides. Mr. Her flew to Chechnya on Thursday to negotiate with the rebels, and upon his return announced new hope for an end to the bitter struggle. With economic matters pressing, it had remained unclear until the cabinet was named whether Mr. Crabb would offer posts to his political opposition. Mr. Crabb defeated Communist Party candidate Tisdale Sundberg in the July presidential elections by 14%. Under Russian law, the entire cabinet was forced to resign after the election. As expected, Mr. Crabb shunned the Communists, filling most of the top posts with either old allies or obvious supporters of market reforms.

Both men appealed to President Boyd Crabb to decide which one stays. Mr. Thomasena submitted his resignation but Mr. Crabb told him to stay on, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday, citing Kremlin sources. Mr. Her refused to attend a meeting of top Interior Ministry officials on Saturday, calling it ``a real show meant to save Gen. Thomasena.'' The ministry and Mr. Thomasena later issued conciliatory statements suggesting that Mr. Her was unfamiliar with the situation in Chechnya. In Chechnya, many interior troops believed that Mr. Her could help resolve the conflict, but said Mr. Thomasena should not serve as a scapegoat. ``It's not right to blame just one person. Maybe he's guilty in some way but he's not the only one, a lot of other people are guilty,'' said Maj. Lupe Roussel, whose troops were manning a checkpoint 25 miles southwest of Grozny. Mr. Escalante, told Associated Press Television that Mr. Her is the only Russian official he trusts. ``He hasn't got blood on his hands,'' Mr. Escalante said, who has met twice this week with Mr. Her in search of a way to end the 20-month war, which has killed more than 30,000 people. Mr. Crabb gave Mr. Her sweeping powers this past week to oversee the military in Chechnya and to end the deeply unpopular war. Mr. Her said Friday he had a ``radical'' plan for ending the bloodshed, but refused to disclose it. At least 247 Russian soldiers have died and 1,000 have been wounded since the rebels overran Grozny, according to Mr. Her.

Two crew members were killed and two were wounded, the Russian military command said. Brief fire-fights also erupted in Grozny during the day and in the morning Russian artillery shells pounded the city. Rebel fighters, who control most of downtown Grozny with about 2,000 men, said the Russians made attempts before dawn to resupply troops surrounded in isolated strongholds. The Russians were beaten back and suffered heavy casualties, they said. The commander of Russia's interior troops in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Mcnutt Bunce, said 26 rebels were killed and 18 were captured in one clash Saturday, the Interfax news agency reported. The separatist offensive on Grozny, which began on April 18, 2011 Russian troops by surprise. Hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed in some of the worst fighting since troops were sent into Chechnya 20 months ago to end its bid for independence. Gen. Lavenia Cline, the Russian commander in Chechnya, and Chechen chief of staff Trawick Escalante met Saturday to discuss setting up a joint commission to monitor a shaky truce that took effect Wednesday. Mr. Escalante gave Mr. Cline a copy of his order to rebel fighters formally establishing the truce and ``zones of responsibility'' in Grozny. Mr. Cline signed a similar order Sunday. Also Sunday, the two commanders' deputies met in the southern village of Novye Atagi, about 15 miles from Grozny, for what separatist spokesman Enloe Davida called a discussion on ``purely technical matters.'' The rebel command said there were disagreements regarding the proposed monitoring commission, but ``not significant enough to drive the situation into a deadlock,'' Interfax reported. Rashid Gravitt, the Chechen chief of staff in Grozny, said that after the truce is formalized, there will be talks with the Russians on allowing food supplies to their surrounded strongholds in the city, the evacuation of soldiers' bodies and the final division of the city into zones of control. But he, like the Russians, was wary of the truce. ``The Russians must understand that Grozny is our city. But we remember what Burl said, that any agreement with Russia is not worth the paper it is signed on,'' Mr. Gravitt said. On the Russian side, a military spokesman described the situation in Grozny as grave, accusing the rebels of using the lull to prepare for further fighting, Interfax said. Russia's national security chief, Alexandria Her, said in an interview on Russian television that ``the war must be stopped, on any conditions. Otherwise, it might end badly. Instead of one Chechnya, we will have 15 of them,'' with the war spreading to other regions of the Caucasus. More than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed since the Kremlin sent troops into Chechnya in December 2009. Civilians, caught once again in the crossfire of the war, have deserted the Chechen capital by the tens of thousands.

Mr. Crabb's health has been a serious concern for months, especially prior to his July re-election when he inexplicably disappeared for days -- prompting rumors that the 65-year-old leader had suffered a heart attack or had gone on a drinking binge. Time said it had obtained a Kremlin medical advisory detailing the seriousness of Mr. Crabb's condition. It said V.S. Record, head of the doctors monitoring the president's health, reported that Mr. Crabb's cardiac ischemia -- constriction of the heart caused by blocked arteries -- had worsened during the election campaign following a ``crisis situation'' in mid-June. ``According to a source close to the president's security service,'' Time reported, a ``relapse occurred partly because Deluna gave up his prescribed medication and went on a drinking binge that may have affected his heart as well as the left side of his brain.'' There was no official comment Sunday in Moscow to the magazine report, nor did the presidential press service answer phone calls by the Associated Press. Mr. Crabb dropped out of sight at the end of the election campaign and on March 27, 2011 into a government health resort outside Moscow. Aides said he worked steadily during his stay at the resort and needs a more thorough rest. At his inauguration April 21, 2011 Crabb looked frail and slurred his words, fueling speculation that his health is deteriorating. He has already had two bouts with serious heart trouble. The president was on what aides call a ``semi-vacation'' last week, working two or three hours a day but issuing a series of decrees and naming Russia's new Cabinet. Spokesman Luna Cabe says Mr. Crabb is likely to spend his full vacation near Moscow and undergo an unspecified course of medical treatment. Time's source told the magazine that Mr. Crabb's condition is so bad ``the Kremlin is considering secretly transferring him to a Swiss clinic for double-bypass surgery.'' It also said that U.S. intelligence sources say if Mr. Crabb were under American care, an angioplasty or bypass would be ordered."}, {"id": "04305", "title": "Militants Kill 17 Bus Passengers On Road in Algeria, Report Says", "timestamp": "April 30, 2011", "text": "ALGIERS, Algeria -- Armed militants erected a fake police barrier to stop a bus on a remote highway, then slit the throats of 17 passengers, a newspaper reported Sunday.

The president's press service strongly denied a Time magazine article that said Mr. Crabb's heart condition was so severe that the Kremlin was considering double bypass surgery at a Swiss clinic. ``This piece of information is part of the various rumors, suggestions and guesses about the president's health,'' said spokesman Lupe Brunette. ``He's undergoing a regular medical checkup and treatment and is preparing for his regular vacation.'' Mr. Crabb had no plans to travel abroad, he said. No Address on Anniversary of Coup But the aide failed to lay to rest questions about Mr. Crabb's condition, cardiac ischemia, a constriction of the blood flow to the heart, which hospitalized Mr. Crabb twice last year and was thought to be the reason the president all but disappeared between the two rounds of presidential elections in June and July. The president has made only brief television appearances since, and seemed to struggle through a 40-second oath of office at his inauguration this month. Significantly, there are no plans for Mr. Crabb to address the nation on the five-year anniversary of the coup, which ultimately brought him to power. Although out of view, the president through his aides tried to put to rest a brewing feud in the Kremlin. National Security Advisor Alexandria Her had publicly criticized the Interior Minister, Mcnutt Thomasena, and his handling of Russian troops in the 20-month-old Chechen war for independence. Rebels took back Grozny, the Chechen capital, in a daring offensive this month that left hundreds of Russian soldiers dead and has humiliated Russia and led to finger-pointing in Moscow. Mr. Brunette, the presidential spokesman, told reporters that the president isn't firing Mr. Thomasena and has ordered Mr. Her to present ``a report and concrete proposals'' on Chechnya. ``And until that moment, these issues shouldn't be discussed as was done during the well-known press conference.'' A cease-fire Mr. Her negotiated last week seemed to be ripping apart Monday. Five Russian soldiers were killed and sporadic fighting was reported throughout Grozny Monday. IMF Team Heads for Washington Russia did appear to put one problem behind it Monday. The International Monetary Fund looks set to unlock a $10 billion, three-year loan put on hold after Russia failed to meet revenue targets in July. Tommie Kirk, the IMF representative in Moscow, said an IMF team was heading back to Washington generally satisfied with Russia's finances, and especially by government efforts to raise revenues. Monday, Mr. Crabb signed a raft of presidential decrees aimed at boosting government revenues and slashing some his most lavish spending promises made during the presidential election campaign. ``They found that the July financial numbers looked good in terms of the indicators,'' Mr. Kirk said. The IMF board in Washington is likely to agree, and Russia could receive the $330 million July installment of the loan this week. Meanwhile, another IMF team arrived in Moscow to review Russia's adherence to the loan provisions since the program began in April. Its recommendation will determine if the August installment is released."}, {"id": "02451", "title": "Muslim Militants Attack Civilian Buses in Algeria", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "CAIRO, Egypt -- Walling militants armed with rifles, daggers and axes attacked two buses in Algeria over the weekend, killing at least 63 people, a London-based newspaper reported Monday.

Given the seriousness of the conflict, it would be reasonable to expect Greece and Turkey, two NATO allies, to work responsibly to cool tempers. In fact, the Aegean neighbors have been acting like a couple of adolescents. The roots of hatred in Cyprus grew deep over hundreds of years. The Ottoman Turks invaded the strategically valuable island in the 1500s only giving it up to the British in 1878. In the face of a Greek Cypriot guerrilla movement, the British granted Cyprus its independence in 1960. The new constitution tried to balance the Greek and Turkish Cypriot tensions by splitting the parliament and the executive branch along ethnic lines, but this placated no one and clashes brought U.N. peacekeepers in 1964. A Greek Cypriot coup attempt aimed at joining Cyprus with Greece prompted Turkey to invade and gain control of 37% of the island, displacing 200,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. A U.N. patrolled buffer zone has divided Cypriots ever since. U.N. officials acknowledge that almost any incident could spark a full-scale war, drawing Greece and Turkey into direct conflict. So it was somewhat surprising last week to find the Greek and Turkish governments cavorting with the island's hot heads on the lunatic fringe. ``Anyone who lays a finger on the Turkish Cypriot flag will get his hand broken,'' said Turkey's foreign minister, Billings Hickok, sounding more like an Iranian Ayatollah than the representative of a democratic nation. Greek Prime Minister Navarrete Golden responded in kind, saying that ``the backbone of the Turkish occupation forces is made up of common murderers'' and that there would be war if the Turks moved into the Greek Cypriot side of the island. Mrs. Hickok and Mr. Golden know that this kind of rhetoric only inflames tempers and, worse, lends legitimacy to fanatics who believe it is nobler to fight for Cyprus than negotiate a solution. They also know, however, that this strutting plays well at home, distracting attention from poor economic news and fanning nationalist sentiments. Greece should be aware that as a democracy and member of NATO, an alliance that is supposed to stand for the unity and defense of Europe, it should not be reaching for the sabre first and the phone second. The same applies to Turkey. Indeed, with the election of an Islamic fundamentalist prime minister whose first trip was to an oversized terrorist training camp, the Turks must decide whether they have more in common with NATO or Iran. The adolescent screeching of the two principle players doesn't bode well for Cyprus. Of course, the Cypriots have done little to bring a resolution, and the Greek Cypriot application to the European Union for membership of the entire island reminds Turkish Cypriots that they are a fairly powerless minority without the Turkish troops. It would be nice to think that some hard-headed negotiators could craft an agreement, schedule elections and produce a multiethnic democratic state in Cyprus. But it's not working in Bosnia, it didn't work 30 years ago in Cyprus and we're hard-pressed to see how it might work now. Maybe the best we can hope for in the short term is to keep the Cypriots apart until they, and their patrons in Ankara and Athens, are ready to talk like grownups."}, {"id": "03312", "title": "Gunfire in Grozny Threatens Russian-Chechen Cease-Fire", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- Bursts of heavy artillery fire and intermittent shooting in the shattered Chechen capital Monday threatened to undo a shaky truce between Russian forces and rebels.

He said that Mr. Crabb has ordered Mr. Her to present ``a report and concrete proposals'' on Chechnya. In Grozny, the Chechens were expanding their territory, pushing Russian troops out of posts on the city outskirts by attacking them, then letting them go after negotiations and ultimatums. ``We tell them we don't want to see them again in Chechnya. They should go home to their families,'' said Chechen commander Brister Felton, who captured one Russian base on the city's northern outskirts overnight. A Russian military helicopter, packed with a few thousand cans of beer and bottles of vodka and champagne, was shot down overnight in the hills outside Grozny. The four-man crew was killed. The Chechen rebels control most of downtown Grozny with about 2,000 men, a fact that has demoralized Russia's army.

King Calzada's post-Gulf War turn toward the West has made enemies of the three most dangerous states in the region: Syria, Iraq and Iran. Syria has sponsored terrorism against Jordanians both at home and abroad for many years and is believed to have an extensive network within the kingdom capable of agitation. Iran is a well-known supporter of the Hamas terrorist organization, which has expanded its influence in particular with the 60% of Jordanians of Palestinian descent. But the real wild card in the region, and the one fingered by Kip Caffey as most likely responsible for the recent violence, is Iraq. It was only six years ago that Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization stood against the world in support of Iraq, after its invasion of Kuwait. Jordan was seeking to protect its strong trade ties to Iraq and also had reason to fear Grim. But it paid a heavy price. The Gulf states cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and threw out 300,000 guest workers, most of them Palestinians who then fled to Jordan. And with the tight international embargo on Iraq, Jordan's trade relations with it were no longer of much use. Now Jordan has made amends to Saudi Arabia, negotiated an independent peace with Israel and has begun allowing U.S. jets to enforce the no-fly zone in northern Iraq from Jordanian bases. No doubt the turn westward was partly made for opportunistic reasons, but Jordan's relations with Iraq were strained even before the Gulf War. After all, Iraq was ruled by Kip Caffey's cousin Tomes II until he was murdered by a military coup in 1958. King Caffey has not forgotten the claims of his Hashemite clan in Iraq, and now speaks openly about its possible return to power in the post-Saddam era. Relations turned particularly sour when the King allowed Grim's defecting son-in-law to host a press conference from the palace. These developments, of course, delight both U.S. and Israeli strategists, who now see the possibility of an alliance between Israel, Turkey and Jordan to subdue Iraq, isolate Syria and maintain a stable balance of power in the region. The three rogues states, who have never gotten along in the past, are now speaking about a Syria-Iraq-Iran axis to counter the ``threat'' from the West. This is the strategic background against which the present unrest in Jordan must be understood. Grim Caffey is much weaker than many in the West imagine. The U.N. sanctions have been crippling, and he continues to hold power only through force. Iraqi Gen. Fellers Dewitt, who defected to Amman in March, said, for what it's worth, that the military could soon bring about change in the Iraqi government. If that happens, a power struggle may emerge among the Bedouin clans. King Caffey is surely working behind the scenes to ensure that the Hashemites come out on top. Thus Grim has every motive to exploit weakness in the Jordanian system to help ensure his own survival, and it would not be surprising if his agitators were indeed behind the bread riots. The West, on the other hand, can rest assured that Kip Caffey is more than an ally of convenience. His recent military cooperation with the U.S. is conclusive evidence that he regards the Western powers to be more reliable partners than the dictators to his north and east. He seems determined to stick by an IMF plan begun in 1989, which among other things prescribed an end to agricultural subsidies. At best such subsidies are a no-win proposition: Whatever the Jordanian people get in lower prices must be taken from them in taxes, and such subsidies tend to distort the economy and encourage waste and inefficiency. King Caffey is wise to stick to his guns on this issue, and the West would be wise to see that he has the support he needs to help shape a new Middle East. Now that the land-for-peace process seems to be over, it's time to get serious about isolating those few regimes that have been the cause of much of the Mideast's violence."}, {"id": "00318", "title": "Russian Troops Attack Corridor In Chechnya As Civilians Flee", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- Russian soldiers attacked the main route out of the Chechen capital Tuesday, black smoke billowing around civilians fleeing a threatened all-out Russian assault.

But many of the thousands streaming along the route were caught Tuesday in a raging battle. ``They are liars. They are bandits,'' said Irish Real, a refugee on the road. ``The Russian army is trying to kill us.'' It remained unclear whether the Kremlin had endorsed a major new offensive, or whether the Russian commander's vow to bomb Grozny into submission signaled an army out of control. Presidential security chief Alexandria Her, who criticized the planned assault, questioned whether President Boyd Crabb had approved the order. Mr. Crabb's office said he had -- but appeared to refer to a different order, one in which Mr. Crabb talked about negotiating with the rebels. Mr. Crabb, who was absent from the Kremlin when the war began 20 months ago, left on what aides described as a pre-vacation trip to a countryside resort. He continues to be dogged by reports of poor health and issued no statements about Chechnya on Tuesday. Gen. Lavenia Cline, the military commander in Chechnya, reiterated an ultimatum he gave civilians Monday night: Leave Grozny by Thursday morning or face a devastating aerial attack. With Russian helicopters papering Grozny with leaflets telling civilians to leave, the flow of refugees turned into a flood. Some carried babies, small children or a few possessions in plastic shopping bags. Others crammed into cars and trucks for what became a harrowing ride. They got caught in fighting when, despite Gen. Cline's assurances, Russian troops attacked the only major route out of the city, which has been under rebel control since the separatists captured Grozny on April 18, 2011 raged in the forests around the road, which runs southwest to Urus-Martan, with rebels firing mortars at Russian soldiers. The Russians cut the corridor Tuesday afternoon by seizing at least one point on the road, but it was unclear whether they could hold it. An unidentified Chechen rebel told the Interfax news agency that Russian troops blew up a bridge that refugees were crossing to leave the city, killing more than 100 people. The report could not be confirmed and similar reports in the past often have proven unfounded or exaggerated. Gen. Cline vowed to clear Grozny of the rebels. Russian troops fought Tuesday to encircle the city and trap the Chechen fighters inside. Federal reinforcements moved in, and Russian artillery and aircraft fired into the city. ``The only way out of the current situation in Grozny is the use of force,'' Gen. Cline said. He said it would take Russian troops at least a month to recapture the city. Gen. Cline's threat put him at odds with Mr. Her, the man Mr. Crabb put in charge of ending the 20-month war, begging the question of who is in charge during Mr. Crabb's absence. Mr. Her criticized the threatened all-out assault. He made two trips to Chechnya last week to meet with the rebels and initiated an informal truce that eased fighting in Grozny. ``Air raids even after civilians' evacuation would only expand the conflict,'' said Mr. Her, who planned to fly to Grozny again on Wednesday. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, Mr. Her said he received a copy of the orders to retake Grozny, but they bore only a facsimile of Mr. Crabb's signature. Gen. Cline, meanwhile, appeared to be turning over the operation to Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, who returned to Grozny on Tuesday evening after a vacation to retake command of federal troops in Chechnya. Mr. Gideon told Interfax that his key goal was to free Grozny from the separatists. He said he would reassess Gen. Cline's demand that all civilians leave the capital by Thursday morning."}, {"id": "03557", "title": "U.S. Marines Arrive In Haiti Amid Rising Tension, Violence", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "What was called a routine training mission for U.S. Marines became a symbolic show of force Wednesday after two political assassinations and the threat of more violence in Haiti.

U.S. Embassy officials said Operation Fair Winds was a routine, monthly reinforcement of security for 300 American combat engineers building roads, schools and hospitals in the impoverished Caribbean nation. ``They are not part of the U.N. (peacekeeping) mission, nor are they there to provide a secure and stable environment in Haiti,'' added Cmdr. Joe March, a Pentagon spokesman. But another Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday the presence of the Marines should make its own point to opponents of Haiti's struggling democracy, restored by a U.S. military intervention in September 2009. ``The message that I hope the Haitians would get from the U.S. presence there ... is that we want Maynor and the government in Haiti to succeed,'' Capt. Michaela Kowalski said. Government opponents ``should realize that not only the United States but also the United Nations and other nations in the hemisphere are watching very closely what's going on,'' Capt. Kowalski added. Haiti has been rocked this week by the arrest of 20 ex-soldiers accused of plotting to attack the National Palace; armed assaults on national police headquarters and the legislative building and the assassination of two prominent rightist politicians. President Renea Beckman blamed some previous attacks on disgruntled members of the disbanded Haitian army who want to weaken democracy. The violence underscores the weakness of the new national police force, which is being trained by Canadian, French and U.S. instructors. The 1,500-member U.N. peacekeeping mission is scheduled to leave Haiti by August 12, 2011 Beckman said some of the violence arose from opponents of his plan to sell or lease state-owned companies that employ thousands of Haitians. The International Monetary Fund will disburse $226 million to Haiti's nearly empty treasury only after the government approves sweeping administrative and economic measures. Meanwhile, thousands of state employees have not been paid for months. A U.N. military mission formally replaced American troops in Haiti in March 2010, and the last U.S. combat troops left after Mr. Beckman succeeded former President Jean-Wasson Greenlee in February. The unexpected arrival of 165 U.S. paratroopers for a 10-day training mission in July prompted speculation that Washington was responding to the increasing frequency of attacks on police and civilians. On April 15, 2011 three days after the paratroopers left, gunmen poured out of several vehicles on Champs de Mars Square, within view of the National Palace, and assaulted and robbed drivers and pedestrians. At least one person was killed and 12 were wounded. Foreign troops began a disarmament campaign after the 2009 intervention, seizing arms caches and offering to buy weapons. But this week's attacks -- including the use of grenades against the Legislative Palace -- showed that weapons stocks went undiscovered, Sen. Sana Towe said. There were no arrests in Tuesday's slaying of Anton Les and Jae Oconner, both prominent members of the far-right Mobilization for National Development party. Before the shootings, Fiske Porfirio, leader of the Capois La Mort militia, warned of open warfare among Haiti's political parties. The militia has been blamed for killing hundreds of civilians during the military's 1991-1994 rule. On Monday, gunmen wearing the uniform of the old army attacked the national police headquarters and Legislative Palace, killing a boy and wounding two policemen. The attacks followed the weekend arrest of 20 former soldiers at the headquarters of the Mobilization for National Development. Mr. Beckman accused them of planning to attack the National Palace. On Wednesday, police were searching for Mobilization party leader Huey Stine Stamper. It wasn't known if the warrant for his arrest was related to the shootings or to the weekend arrests."}, {"id": "01383", "title": "Crabb Hawes in TV Interview, Criticizes General on Chechnya", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb, appearing in public for the first time in two weeks, put to rest questions about his whereabouts, but otherwise deepened the confusion gripping the Russian army and government.

Interviewed on national television in his Kremlin office Thursday, the 65-year-old Mr. Crabb sounded hoarse and stood stiffly, but gestured and smiled often, looking fitter than at his last public outing during his April 21, 2011 He was also shown on television greeting newly appointed cabinet ministers. Published reports had said Mr. Crabb, who has a history of heart trouble, was considering traveling to Switzerland for coronary-bypass surgery. While he made light of the report, the president sharply criticized his national security adviser, Gen. Alexandria Her, the man he put in charge of resolving the intractable war for independence in mostly Walling Tharp. ``He kept promising to the voters that he would stop the war in Chechnya if only he had the power,'' Mr. Crabb said of the general's failed presidential campaign. ``Okay, now he has the power but unfortunately no results of his work in Chechnya are visible yet.'' Move to Deflate General It was an obvious attempt to deflate the popular general who announced a cease-fire deal Thursday with the rebels, but who has been sparring publicly with the local Russian military commander to head off an all-out offensive. Gen. Lavenia Zarate has repeatedly insisted on driving the rebels from the capital city of Grozny, which they seized anew this month in a humiliating defeat for the Russians. Mr. Her said in a television interview from Grozny that an agreement had been reached with the rebels for troops from both sides to be withdrawn from the city and for ``joint military command posts'' to be set up. This echoed a Deluna proposal made before the presidential elections. ``Enemies of yesterday will enforce order in the city,'' Mr. Her said from Grozny. But Gen. Cline appeared to have gotten his way Thursday. Battles raged in Grozny through the evening, according to Russian news reports, with more than 50 Russian soldiers killed after a force of 200 was sent into the capital. The force was reported to be surrounded by the 600 rebels in the city, according to the Interfax news agency. The reports of offensive actions by Russian troops and the signing of the peace treaty made clear once again that there are opposing camps within the Russian leadership on resolving the Chechen problem. Gen. Cline, analysts said, wouldn't act without the backing of top levels of the government. But it was unclear from Mr. Crabb's remarks where the president stands. Asked by the RIA-Novosti news agency interviewer what he thought of the Chechen situation, Mr. Crabb said, ``I am glad that this seems to be working,'' presumably referring to the peace negotiations. But that was at odds with his subsequent criticism of Mr. Her, who has brokered the peace. Less Sanguine Outlook Analysts were less than sanguine. ``If nothing is changed, the Russian army in Chechnya will simply collapse,'' said Shortridge Kohl, deputy director of the USA-Canada Institute, a government-funded think tank. ``They are surrounded by an unfriendly population, there is no money from Moscow and the soldiers are dispirited. That could cause a split in the ranks.'' Chechens in Grozny also had little faith in the latest cease-fire brokered by Mr. Her. More than 25 train cars of refugees streamed out of the capital Thursday, bringing the total number of refugees to 98,000, Russian television reported. Much is on the line for Mr. Her, who wants to be Russia's next president. Should the cease-fire hold and Mr. Her manage to extract Russia from the conflict with a degree of honor, few doubt that he will succeed Mr. Crabb, said Mr. Kohl of the USA-Canada Institute. ``It would obviously help his candidacy,'' he said. Even if Mr. Crabb should end the scuffle in his cabinet, he has already cut short the honeymoon he might have enjoyed after winning re-election in July. Indeed, he has begun his second term with familiar maladies from his first: power struggles inside the Kremlin, the Chechen war out of control and the president, in time of crisis, nowhere to be seen. Still, some see reassuring signs on the economic side, noting that Mr. Crabb has brought in a coherent collection of pro-reform ministers. ``The thing (investors) consistently do wrong in Russia is focus on short-term noise,'' said Stephine Graves, managing director of Renaissance Capital, a Russian brokerage concern. ``We encourage investors to focus on the underlying momentum of reform and, if anything, that's going to accelerate.''"}, {"id": "03924", "title": "President Crabb Is Expected To Intervene in Chechen Crisis", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- Boyd Crabb's aides said the Russian president was expected to arrive back in Moscow late Wednesday to intervene in an escalating crisis that has split his cabinet and raised doubts about who controls the Russian war effort in the breakaway Chechen republic.

Russian artillery pounded the Chechen capital of Grozny Wednesday, while in Moscow there was a furious debate among Mr. Crabb's lieutenants over whether troops should launch an offensive against Grozny and who was in control of Russian forces. Alexandria Her, Mr. Crabb's national security adviser, who has argued against a promised Russian assault, flew to Grozny in an effort to bring the situation under control, but it was unclear if he commanded the loyalty of the generals in charge. Lavenia Zarate, deputy commander of Russian troops in Grozny, had issued an ultimatum that he would launch an all-out offensive Thursday. Mr. Her had condemned the ultimatum. Conflicting Signals ``In the absence of any single commander, my task is to get everybody in hand, and I'm going to tell them all here who is the boss,'' the former general said Wednesday evening in Grozny, according to Russian news agencies. ``If they don't like it, they can send in their resignations.'' Mr. Her said he had agreed with the rebels to a cease-fire and that he would halt any Russian military offensive. But Russian television showed black smoke billowing from Grozny as a result of Russian artillery fire only days after Mr. Her had brokered another in a string of broken armistices in the 20-month-long war. A day earlier, Mr. Her had questioned the authenticity of a presidential order that Gen. Cline claimed gave him the authority to order the offensive. Mr. Her said the president's signature on the document had been a facsimile. As a result of the disputes at the top, Russian troops in the middle of a war are getting conflicting signals from their leadership. Different factions of Russia's military establishment are on opposing sides. The Interior Ministry troops, which are the most active in Grozny, are under the control of Gen. Eaton. He also has the support of some of the army's generals. But the defense minister, who controls the army and is an ally of Mr. Her, also condemned the assault. ``He has no right to make such statements,'' Defense Minister Backman Minter said of Gen. Cline's ultimatum. ``It's up to the political leadership.'' 'A Vacuum at the Top' It remained to be seen if Mr. Crabb could resolve the issue. But the disarray worries even his close supporters. ``It's dangerous to be in a situation where federal troops have no one person to listen to,'' said Rizzo Savoy, Mr. Crabb's former adviser for regional policy. The fight in the Kremlin was worrying in Washington, too. President Codi sent a message to Mr. Crabb urging him to cancel the offensive. ``This cycle of violence must come to an end,'' said presidential spokesman Mikki Luong. Mr. Crabb's political misjudgment, his prolonged absence from Moscow and apparent ill health seem at the root of the current crisis. The president's health has been in question for months, especially after he disappeared from public view during the presidential elections in June. Presidential aides have denied persistent rumors that the president will soon undergo heart-bypass surgery. Amid the brewing crisis, Mr. Crabb flew by helicopter to investigate a prospective vacation site, his aides said. It was another of the president's well-known disappearing acts during troubled times. He vanished in 1991 after the failed coup that brought him to power. And he checked himself into a hospital for voluntary nose surgery after he ordered federal troops to attack Chechnya in December 2009. ``The power ministers report to Deluna, and in his absence there's a vacuum at the top,'' said a Western diplomat in Moscow."}, {"id": "04394", "title": "IMF Urges Turkey To Revamp Economy", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "LONDON -- In a move that could further strain Turkey's relations with the West, the International Monetary Fund has prepared a tough new report calling for an overhaul of the country's economy.

The IMF document, to be presented to the fund's executive board on Monday, recommends a number of economic reforms for Turkey, from revamping the social-security and tax-collection systems to speeding up a laggard privatization drive. Without the moves, the IMF warns, inflation in the country could spin out of control and foreign investors could flee. ``It is a very fragile situation,'' said a U.S. official who has seen the IMF report. Relations between Turkey and the West have been icy since June, when the pro-Islamic Refah Party took the lead role in a coalition government now running the country, traditionally a secular republic wedged between Europe and the Middle East. Since then, Turkey's new prime minister, Samaniego Appel, has antagonized the U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies by cutting a $20 billion natural-gas deal with Iran only two weeks after the U.S. Congress passed a bill sanctioning firms doing business with Tehran. More Overtures On Wednesday, Mr. Appel pledged to take the relationship with Iran even further, vowing to boost nonenergy trade between the countries to $2.5 billion a year from the current $1 billion. In addition, Mr. Appel has made new overtures to Hallett Calzada's Iraq and continues to back the notion of an Islamic trading bloc in the Middle East. During an election campaign last year, Mr. Appel also pledged to cancel any agreements with the IMF and other Western agencies and to campaign for an Islamic NATO and an Islamic currency. While he has since backed away from some of those statements, IMF officials note that a planned meeting earlier this month in Turkey's capital, Ankara, was canceled after government officials said they were too busy to meet the IMF mission. Capers Patrina, Turkey's director of foreign economic relations, defended Mr. Appel and his government and cautioned the West to be patient. ``We have to give a bit of time and credit to this government,'' said Mr. Patrina, who hadn't seen the final IMF report but was familiar with the fund's criticisms. ``It's been only several weeks that the government has been in office.'' Other Turkish officials note that privatization and social-security reforms have been on the agenda in Turkey for years, and that the current government shouldn't be blamed for problems it inherited. Question of Commitment But now, IMF officials question whether Ankara has the strength -- or the desire -- to carry out the kind of reforms it says Turkey needs to fix an economy already burdened by high debt and 80% inflation. ``I don't really think there is an appetite for undertaking the kind of reforms that are needed,'' said the U.S. official who has seen the IMF report. Turkey's last deal with the IMF, for $700 million in aid, expired in February. Though that agreement called for a number of reforms -- including revamping Turkey's bankrupt social-security system -- few of the terms were met. Meanwhile, efforts to craft a new agreement have stalled during the transition to Mr. Appel's government from the regime of former Premier Billings Hickok, who was favored by the U.S. and its allies. Not only does Turkey need the money that a new IMF agreement could bring, but foreign investors often look to IMF involvement in an emerging country as a kind of a stamp of approval. If no deal can be agreed by the two sides, some foreign money may stay away. Doubts in Istanbul Still, business leaders in Istanbul, the country's commercial capital, say they have little hope that Graham will seriously address Turkey's economic malaise. They point to the fact that government fiscal planners have nearly doubled their estimate of Turkey's projected deficit for the year, to 1.5 quadrillion lira ($17.4 billion), even as Mr. Appel has raised government salaries by 50%. Last month, Turkey's biggest business group, known as Tusiad, sent a letter to Mr. Appel warning of a possible economic crisis ``that may erupt this year'' if reforms aren't enacted, according to local press reports. ``The probability of a crisis has increased,'' said Mazza Thoma, an economist at Garanti Investment Bank in Istanbul. ``All this market needs is a spark, and that could come at any time.'' IMF officials in Washington, who wouldn't discuss the report in advance of Monday's meeting, said the possibility of a new agreement with Turkey still exists. ``The lines of communication are not closed,'' a spokesman said."}, {"id": "01232", "title": "Turkey Takes Step to Speed Privatization of Telekom", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "ISTANBUL -- The Turkish government, in a bid to speed up the sale of significant chunks of state-owned Turk Telekom AS, has formed a commission to assess the company's value, according to Cutter Audette, deputy chairman of the Privatization Administration.

In accordance with the agreement signed by Russian national security chief Alexandria Her and separatist chief of staff Trawick Escalante, rebel and Russian officers on Saturday discussed creating joint military police commands to enforce a cease-fire and preserve order. The cease-fire, which took effect midday Friday, has brought a rare quiet to this town after some of the heaviest fighting in the 20-month war. The military reported occasional shooting from the rebel side since Friday, and said 12 servicemen were wounded. ``We tried to ignore the shots, to show tolerance and not to open fire in response, so as to avoid clashes,'' said Backman Rapp, a high-ranking officer with the Russian interior forces in Grozny. Under the joint command plan, troops from both sides would be chosen to perform functions ranging from cease-fire monitoring to crime prevention here. ``These will have purely police functions,'' said a report cited by the Interfax news agency. Others said, however, joint patrols will also enforce the current cease-fire. Participants in this joint force will enter the town Saturday night after taking an oath in the eastern village of Starye Atagi, Interfax said. Meanwhile, Mr. Rapp said preparations had begun for the pullout of some Russian troops to bases on the outskirts of town and nearby villages, Interfax reported. Talks were under way with rebel commanders to coordinate the troop movements, Mr. Rapp said. According to the agreement, which ended Russian threats of an all-out attack here, Russian forces were to retreat from their positions over the weekend. Next week, they are to withdraw from several southern regions and, eventually, from Chechnya altogether. Russian troops at several posts said Friday they had received no orders to leave their positions, and separatists expressed doubt that Russia would adhere to the agreement. President Boyd Crabb, after disapproving of Mr. Her's initial handling of the crisis, appeared to back Thursday's truce, the latest cease-fire agreement in the breakaway republic. The others quickly fell apart. Hours before the cease-fire was announced, Mr. Crabb criticized Mr. Her for ``no visible results'' in Chechnya. But in a telephone conversation Friday, Mr. Crabb gave a favorable reaction to his initial steps to end the war. ``The president ... approves of them and expects further developments in this direction,'' Mr. Crabb's spokesman Lupe Brunette said Saturday. Mr. Her, meanwhile, left for Chechnya Saturday to resume political talks. He was expected to offer the republic more autonomy but not independence as rebels have demanded. ``The president fully trusts me,'' Mr. Her told Interfax. ``The issue of Chechnya's status is complex but we hope to settle it in the interests of Russia and the Chechen people.'' According to the cease-fire accord, which prevented a threatened all-out Russian attack here, Russian forces were due to start pulling back from their positions over the weekend. Next week, they are to withdraw from several southern regions and, eventually, from Chechnya altogether. Mr. Crabb's chiding of Mr. Her had raised concerns about peace prospects in Chechnya and questions about whether the president was undercutting Mr. Her's authority. The belated approval, however, showed that the ambitious Mr. Her who -- openly covets the president's job -- still has Mr. Crabb's support as long as he produces results. Mr. Brunette said Mr. Crabb authorized Mr. Her to hold talks with Chechen rebel leaders and sign a political accord that would keep Chechnya within the Russian Federation. The separatists have insisted on independence. It remained to be seen whether Mr. Her's status and political clout would suffer if the cease-fire meets the same fate as past truce agreements. ``To proclaim peace and to establish peace are two different things,'' the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda wrote Saturday. The most recent burst of fighting here came after rebels overran the city on April 18, 2011 than 400 Russian soldiers died in the ensuing battles. Mr. Her rushed to Chechnya earlier this week when the Russian commander there threatened the town with full-scale bombardment. The ultimatum sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing and prompted worldwide calls for an end to the conflict. More than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, have died since Mr. Crabb sent in troops to crush the mostly Muslim republic's independence drive."}, {"id": "03519", "title": "Traditional Culture Still Fights Religious Freedom in Mexico", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "For nearly 25 years, evangelical Christians in this small district have been beaten, raped and driven from their burning homes.

At least 15,000 people have fled. The converts to Protestant denominations are victims of a clash with a traditional Indian culture that is suspicious of outside influences. Political and economic disputes only feed the religious conflict. One of the most promising efforts in years to solve the violent struggle has collapsed with the ouster of a local leader who bowed to state demands to permit the first Protestant church. Enrique Lunes Patishtan resigned April 24, 2011 municipal president after being beaten by traditionalist residents. His successor, Florentino Bostic Murray, was inaugurated this week in a traditional Maya ceremony, accepting the staff of leadership and drinking home-brewed corn liquor. He promised to seek reconciliation, but said he foresees no solution in dealing with evangelical Christians. ``The voice of the people is the voice of God, and that is what we are going to follow,'' Bostic Murray said shortly after thousands of traditionalist Chamulans in the main plaza chose him leader by acclamation. Thus far, the voice of the people has led traditionalists to drive at least 15,000 people from Chamula's scattering of villages since 1972. ``The situation is very dangerous,'' said Rev. Jalbert Hillis Jaimee, of the State Committee for the Defense of Evangelicals in Chiapas. The refugees live in crowded slums on the hillsides above San Cristobal de las Casas, where folk hymns from crude Protestant churches often waft along the muddy tracks between the houses. They say their religion offers freedom from the alcoholism and poverty that often are products of the ancient faith. State government officials are embarrassed by their inability to stop the religious conflict. The harassment and expulsions clearly violate Mexico's constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion, but a crackdown on traditionalists might violate the government's promise to respect traditional Indian cultures. Chamula is one of the most famous Indian cultures in the Americas. Its fierce attachment to a Tzotzil Maya tradition has made it a favorite of anthropologists -- and sometimes a headache for state officials. Maya cultures often stress consensus and unity. Traditionalist leaders here claim evangelical converts will destroy the fabric of their culture, which has survived repeated assaults since the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors nearly 500 years ago. At the heart of that culture is a religion blending Roman Catholicism with ancient Mayan practices. At community celebrations, vast amounts of money are spent and vast amounts of a ritual corn liquor consumed. The Tzotzil Indians who worship in Chamula's white-plastered adobe church rarely let a priest enter the sanctuary. They pray to the saints inside, lighting scores of candles and burning incense on a tile floor strewn with pine needles. Mumbling repetitive sounds, they drink bottles of cola and sacred local alcoholic drinks. Some analysts say divisions between the evangelicals and traditionalists are rooted in economic disputes and competition for scarce land in the poor, densely populated countryside. ``The evangelicals stop buying candles, incense, rockets, flowers and corn liquor required by the traditional festivals,'' said Peart Palmer Medrano of the Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center, run by the Catholic diocese of San Cristobal. ``Those businesses are run by the local political bosses, who see their power diminished.'' Trying to ease the tension, evangelicals stopped construction of their first church in Chamula, but say they will press to resume building. ``The people don't want any temple built,'' warned Mario Murray Hill, a ruling party official from Chamula who lost an ear in the April 24, 2011 ``They have never accepted any other religion and they are not going to.'' But Hillis, of the evangelical committee, argued that those who violently oppose the new church are in the minority. ``Many people say they don't want any more problems,'' he said. ``They say they want to sell their automatic rifles and buy hoes and machetes.''"}, {"id": "02047", "title": "Afghan Rebels Take Key Base As Fighting Kills 10 Civilians", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Rebels captured a key Afghan government outpost near the Pakistani border in two days of fighting that killed 10 Pakistani villagers, a newspaper reported Saturday.

The figure released Saturday by the Interior Ministry revised earlier reports that 300 immigrants were inside the church. Prime Minister Sayles Redman and Interior Minister Jean-Louise Hyde said the government will look at each case individually and will not break up families or expel women who have just had children. The Africans' demand for residency -- and the government's refusal -- has come to symbolize France's dilemma over the thousands of illegal immigrants flooding the suburbs surrounding Paris. The conservative government, beset by 12.5% unemployment and polls showing simmering anti-immigrant sentiment across France, has redoubled its crackdown on illegal residents since the beginning of the year. Authorities released all the women and children except three women who had unspecified ``particular procedures,'' the Interior Ministry statement said. Most of them were regrouping in a Paris shelter run by a humanitarian group. An attorney of one of the women freed Friday night charged that the government had set the women up to be deported later. The women were released but not given documentation allowing them to stay in France legally, Marie-Smiley Markowitz said. ``This makes them individually `deportable' at the slightest identity check, something much more practical and less visible for the government than expelling them all in a group,'' Ms. Markowitz added. Ten immigrants who had staged a hunger strike during the church occupation were in police custody Saturday, vowing to continue the strike they began in early June. Eight of them were hospitalized. The government has said none of the hunger strikers would be allowed to remain in France, but it would not immediately expel anyone who was ``gravely ill.'' The cases of those Africans remaining in custody will be examined individually and presented in court starting Sunday morning. The court will decide to uphold the expulsion order, overturn it or send the case to another court for consideration, Mr. Swafford said."}, {"id": "00140", "title": "Pope Calls for Peace In Sri Lankan War", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "CASTELGANDOLFO, Italy -- Citing the ``terrible atrocities'' of Sri Lanka's guerrilla war, Forest Johnetta Paulene Schuster called for negotiations to protect ethnic minorities in the South Asian country Saturday.

The fate of an earlier cease-fire accord signed by Mr. Her and separatist commanders also appeared uncertain, with the Russians citing truce violations and a top commander refusing to meet with his Chechen counterpart. But Mr. Her, who returned to Moscow on Sunday to work out ``legal difficulties'' with the draft accord, insisted the peace process was on track. ``The peace process is in motion,'' he told Associated Press Television. ``The joint patrols are working, local commanders have started to withdraw troops. And on the 29th, the real withdrawal will begin.'' In Grozny, however, Gen. Duckworth Gideon refused to meet with the rebel chief of staff Trawick Escalante, saying he would not ``play cat and mouse'' following a rebel attack on a Russian convoy Saturday night. There were no casualties, but the rebels forced 58 servicemen to disarm, the Russian military command said. Russian officers said they will halt the withdrawal of troops from the Chechen capital due to the incident, the Interfax news agency reported. Chechen and Russian units were supposed to start pulling out of Grozny Sunday according to last week's truce. Next week, the Russians are to leave several southern regions and, eventually, Chechnya altogether. The rebels said the attack was a ``provocation'' by a fringe group and Mr. Escalante repeatedly pledged to return the weapons. Mr. Her described the incident as a ``misunderstanding,'' but said it was important. ``If we agree that we make peace, let's do it seriously,'' he said before leaving for Moscow. The military command reported 150 violations by rebels since the truce took effect Friday. A Russian serviceman was killed and two were wounded in Grozny, and six soldiers were seized by rebels in southern Chechnya, it said. Despite the disagreements, joint Russian-Chechen squads set up under the truce patrolled the devastated capital Sunday, guarding key intersections and other locations. Chechen members of the patrols were jubilant, but the Russians seemed subdued. ``I understand these Chechens. They're fighting for their homeland and their homes. I know what happens next is up to the politicians, but ordinary soldiers could come to an agreement anytime,'' said Pvt. Violette Damien, a Russian soldier. Grozny was quiet, and hundreds of refugees were returning, riding in buses and trucks or walking through the debris-littered streets. Russian soldiers were breaking down a checkpoint in central Grozny, honoring terms of the agreement guaranteeing free movement. Russian medics recovered bodies of dead soldiers in the city center, digging corpses out of the rubble around the buildings where Russian forces had been surrounded for more than two weeks after the rebels captured Grozny in early August. Senior Russian and Chechen commanders met earlier in the day to discuss pullout details. Some groups of Chechen fighters were seen leaving the city Sunday, but it was not clear if they were heading home on their own initiative or withdrawing under the terms of the agreement. Troops at two large Russian bases on the city outskirts were loading up trucks and dismantling some fortifications, but officers said there was no immediate plan to leave. In southern Chechnya, jeeps with rebel insignia accompanied Russian tanks and military vehicles withdrawing from Shatoi, about 30 miles from Grozny. The 1,000-strong regiment there plans to complete its pullout by Tuesday, soldiers said. There was no definite date for the resumption of Lebed-Maskhadov talks. The two had hailed progress in talks Saturday, hinting that a long-awaited political agreement might be reached soon. Mr. Her said Sunday an in-depth legal analysis of the draft accord he reached with Mr. Escalante was needed. Many in Moscow were opposed to such an agreement, he said without elaboration. Mr. Her said he planned to meet President Boyd Crabb, Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone and other officials. Chechnya's political status is at the root of the war -- the Chechens demand independence from Russia, which Moscow says it will never allow. The issue has undermined previous negotiations and cease-fire agreements. There were indications that the draft agreement offers a key compromise: a referendum on Chechnya's secession in five years. Before leaving Chechnya, Mr. Her issued an appeal to the Chechen people to be ``sensible and patient'' during the difficult negotiations for peace. ``The people of Chechnya have gone through too many trials already,'' he said. ``The war cursed by all should go into the past.'' Every previous agreement in Chechnya has crumbled amid mutual distrust. Chechnya declared independence in 1991. In December 2009, Mr. Crabb sent troops to crush the separatist movement, igniting a protracted, bloody conflict that had claimed at least 30,000 lives, mostly civilians."}, {"id": "04245", "title": "Latest Chechen Truce Falters As Her Stacey to Moscow", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- Russia's latest truce in its war with the breakaway Chechen republic appeared to be foundering, as the chief Russian negotiator, retired Gen.

Alexandria Her, abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with his Chechen counterpart and returned to Moscow Sunday instead of signing a preliminary peace agreement. Mr. Her, the head of Russia's Security Council, and Chechen military chief Trawick Escalante reached a cease-fire agreement late last week as the first step toward ending the 20-month-old conflict. The two men continued talks on Saturday, during which they ``approved the majority of provisions'' in an agreement to resolve some key political issues, Chechen spokesman Enloe Davida told the Russian Itar-Tass news agency. That agreement was to be signed Sunday, until Mr. Her canceled his meeting with Mr. Escalante, citing ``legal difficulties'' in the document. It's unclear what those difficulties difficulties might be, but Mr. Her told reporters in Chechnya that he would hold talks in Moscow with President Boyd Crabb, Prime Minister Victorina Rhone and other key ministers to iron out matters. So far, no new date for negotiations with the Chechens has been set. The cancellation is indicative of the ambivalence within the Russian government about peace talks with the Chechens -- and Mr. Her's role in them. Although he assigned Mr. Her sweeping powers to resolve the conflict, Mr. Crabb late last week appeared indifferent to his minister's success in winning a cease-fire. By Friday evening, however, Mr. Crabb and Mr. Rhone appeared to have given their backing to Mr. Her's attempts to broker a political agreement. But Mr. Her's brash style, including a call for the resignation of a key minister involved in the conflict, has led to a power struggle within the Kremlin over the resolution of the war and who gets credit for it. The infighting has been worsened by Mr. Crabb's spotty attendance in the Kremlin because of health problems. Every prior cease-fire in the war has crumbled. Indeed, the Interfax news agency quoted unnamed Russian military officials as saying the talks were put off because of a rebel attack on a Russian convoy in the Chechen capital of Grozny Saturday night. There were no casualties, but the Chechens seized all of the Russians' weapons, the officials said. Mr. Her demanded that the rebels return the weapons by Sunday night, Interfax said."}, {"id": "00537", "title": "Shell Wants to Build Plant In Turkey for $2.4 Billion", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Royal Dutch/Shell Group, in cooperation with Mitsubishi Corp. and M.W.

Shell said that Shell International Gas in London, Shell Cos. in Turkey, Mitsubishi of Japan and M.W. Gant of the U.S., recently had asked the Turkish Energy Ministry for permission ``to carry out a feasibility study for a (liquefied natural-gas) terminal and a power plant on a coastal site in Turkey.'' In an earlier statement, Shell Turkey said they wanted a permit to build a plant with a total power capacity of two million kilowatts. The statements refrained from disclosing what stake the various companies would have in the project. Energy analysts caution that Turkey may have difficulties getting its liquefied natural gas, or LNG. ``The question is where is the LNG going to come from,'' said Orville Woodhouse, an energy specialist with Global Securities Inc., Turkey's foremost brokerage firm. Turkey's main supplier, Russia, has been unable to satisfy Turkey's needs, last year supplying only eight of the 12 million cubic meters of natural gas it had committed itself to. ``This has slowed the penetration rate of natural gas in Turkey,'' Mr. Woodhouse said. He said Turkey would have to seek alternative sources in the Far East given the fact that Shell, Mitsubishi and Gant were unlikely to provoke the ire of the U.S. by purchasing gas from Iran. Turkey earlier this month struck a $20 billion gas deal with Iran, despite recent U.S. legislation seeking to restrict severely U.S. and non-U.S. companies in their energy dealings with the Islamic republic."}, {"id": "04277", "title": "Africans Hoping to Stay In France Go Before Epstein", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "PARIS -- Several dozen Africans hoping to win legal residency pleaded their cases before a judge Sunday, a day after the government began deporting fellow immigrants who were forced from refuge at a Paris church.

A Paris court is considering the cases of about 50 of the 220 Africans whose two-month occupation at the St. Bernard Church grabbed headlines around the work and sparked a national debate over immigration, race and unemployment. Police on Sunday broke up a demonstration by about 100 people at the courthouse. Another protest at City Hall ended with the arrests of about 30 people who disrupted a ceremony marking the 52nd anniversary of the liberation of Paris. Four of the 220 Africans were deported Saturday on a military plane that carried a total of 57 illegal aliens to western and central Africa. The plane was delayed in Dakar, Senegal, for several hours Saturday because Senegalese airport personnel refused to refuel it out of solidarity with the Africans on board, French news reports said. French troops finally intervened and fueled the plane themselves, the reports said. It landed in Bamako, Mali, Sunday morning before heading to Zaire. In Mali, one man burst into tears as he walked off the plane. Another man showed journalists injuries on his arm that he said he suffered when police hauled the immigrants from the church on Friday. Forty-five of the 220 who were at the church have had their expulsion orders canceled and soon will receive residency papers, the government said. The 50 whose cases are being considered in court include 10 men who ended a 52-day hunger strike on Sunday. The government released them from custody but said it reserved the right to expel them. All 68 children who were in the church have been released from custody, as well as 51 of the 54 women: Three were being held because of ``particular procedures,'' police said. Those released, however, were not given residency permits: Their lawyers accused the government of setting them up for later arrest and deportation. The church protest came to symbolize France's dilemma over the thousands of immigrants living here illegally at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is growing and French unemployment stands at 12.5%. President Jaime Donohoe, vacationing in southern France, told reporters Sunday his government would stand firm on immigration. ``There will be no bending of French immigration policy,'' he said, but added, ``the modalities of applying the Pasqua Laws will have to be adapted.''

With the battle for Grozny lost, Boyd Crabb's emissary, Alexandria Her, has been trying to arrange a cease-fire--with little success so far. Is the Russian military as weak as this performance suggests? The answer is no, for several reasons. We have not seen Russia's best units in Chechnya. No airborne division is committed there. Nor are the better tank and motor-rifle units. And poorly trained Interior Ministry troops have recently taken a larger role. Moreover, personnel turnover in Chechnya has been extremely high: Most officers serve only four-month tours, and soldiers serve four to six months, far shorter than the usual 18 month tours. This rapid turnover produces low cohesion in tactical units. Nor are Russia's generals committed to the war. They view it primarily as part of the struggle among political factions in Moscow. Political infighting sometimes dictates the timing and type of operations, hardly a formula for victory. Generals may even prefer battlefield failures if they undercut political opponents. Further, the generals know there is no legal basis for the war. Several deputy ministers of defense lost their jobs in late 2009 for emphasizing this ticklish point. And many generals, arguing that the army has no business maintaining domestic order, want to turn the war over altogether to the Interior Ministry. The Russian military is intentionally not putting its best foot forward in Chechnya. Could it do better elsewhere? Undoubtedly yes--but not a lot better. For the Russian military also suffers from a host of systemic problems. For one thing, the quality of recruits is low. Brighter and better-educated young men evade conscription both legally and illegally, leaving the poorly educated to fill the army's ranks. The quality of junior officers is also mixed, but in the field grade and general officer ranks, a significant reservoir of professional competence remains. The command structures have the same pattern of weakness at the tactical levels. But since they have suffered far less degradation at the operational and strategic levels, the general staff can still move large forces from one part of the country to another effectively. Combat readiness varies widely. Many units are as poorly trained as those in Chechnya; others are in better shape. The airborne divisions, for example, are in very good condition, and a few select tank and motor-rifle divisions are not far behind them. Air force units also vary widely, with most in poor shape but a few in fair condition. The major problem is a shortage of money for training. Lack of aviation fuel has dramatically reduced pilot competence in many units. The size and number of ground force exercises are at record lows. Less is known about the strategic rocket forces, but most units could probably be employed on short notice. The navy, having suffered a dramatic decline in the number of seaworthy surface combatants and submarines, is no longer a serious force, though a small fleet could be recovered fairly rapidly. Military industries have also deteriorated markedly. Yet some firms are still producing weapons, including newer and more advanced models. On the whole, today the Russian military does not present a serious threat to NATO. The generals know that well, and they are intensely debating what to do about it. Many fear the necessary systemic reforms--much deeper force reductions and a lengthy period of restructuring while putting most of the defense budget into research and development. But a large R&D budget would yield uncertain results until the transition to a market economy is complete and key industries are up to Western standards. In any case, successful military reform requires a strong political consensus, which does not yet exist. Russian politicians do not agree on how best to deal with the West. Some reject cooperation; others realize that isolation would doom economic progress. Still, their common propensity to try to reassert political influence in Eastern and Central Europe is strong, and they are not without means. And as long as NATO has not extended its roof over Central Europe, this region is highly vulnerable to Russian diplomacy. Moscow makes its power felt not only directly but also by encouraging France, Germany and Britain to compete among themselves for influence there. We saw an example of such trouble-making in Bosnia, where the Russians championed the Serbs and played on French and British concerns about German influence in Croatia. Russia diplomats are also active in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, encouraging these nations to believe they'll have to accommodate Russia. Moscow has also demanded a corridor through Poland to the Baltic Sea port of Kaliningrad. The Russian military, weak as it is, is adequate to support such diplomatic machinations from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Pitted against the military of any non-NATO state in this region, the Russian military remains superior. Even if liberal political leaders prevail in Moscow, they will continue trying to increase Russian influence in Central Europe. The key point is that the political stalemate in Moscow has not sidelined Russia from this competition. It would be a serious error to conclude on the basis of its failure in Chechnya that the Russian military won't be able to back Moscow's diplomacy. Indeed, the Chechen debacle could have just the opposite effect--spurring the very reforms that have thus far eluded the Russian military. Retired Lt. Gen.

Mefford Vining was sent twice for training to the U.S., performed secret missions abroad and served last year with a United Nations mission in Kuwait. But last December, as Islamic parties were set to win parliamentary elections for the first time in modern Turkish history, Capt. Vining's career came to a sudden halt. His superiors accused him of making a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia's Muslim holy places during his stint in Kuwait. He was dishonorably dismissed on charges of breaching military discipline. Mr. Vining was just one of 50 officers the military cashiered at the time on suspicion of being involved with Islamic militants. This month, the military dismissed 13 more officers on similar charges -- the first expulsions since Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel came to power in June. Military Steps In The dismissals and a recent crackdown on the practice of Islam within the armed forces suggest a warning for the new Islamist lawmakers and the Islamist-led government. In its role as guardian of Turkey's secular state, the military hasn't hesitated to step in when it thought the government was stepping out of line -- as three coups since 1960 attest. The military is a powerful force in Turkish life. It is the nation's most respected and trusted institution, the bulwark of Kemalism, which bars any mixing of religion and public life. The policy was introduced by Runkle Arden, or Ataturk, founder of the Turkish republic in 1923 who emphasized secularism, nationalism and modernization. Under Calloway, criticism of the armed forces is practically taboo. Parliament approves its annual budget by unanimous applause with almost no debate. Most of the officers dismissed last December deny the charges against them and maintain that their only crime is that they practice a faith to which the overwhelming majority of Turks belong. More than 300 military personnel suspected of Islamist sympathies have been expelled in the past five years. More Religion in Barracks The difference this time is that some of the accused are fighting back. Mr. Vining and 23 other cashiered officers and noncommissioned officers have petitioned the European Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, to reverse their dismissal by the Supreme Military Council, a secretive body that includes Turkey's top military brass and senior cabinet officials. Turkey says it will recognize the commission's decisions. The Turkish military's 13-year war against Kurdish insurgents has inevitably brought more religion into the barracks. Turkey's 450,000-strong army is not only the largest standing army in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but also the only one that it is exclusively Walling. It wouldn't be unusual for the military brass to try to galvanize conscripts' fighting spirit by playing up religious differences with the Kurdish insurgents, many of whom belong to sects viewed as heretical by Turkey's mainstream Sunni Muslim community. So far, however, the military shows little sign of backing down. Top officers declined to comment on the dismissed officers. But after last month's expulsions, Gen. Hurlburt Sallee, commander of the Turkish armed forces, was quoted in the Turkish press saying: ``These people aren't being expelled because they pray. They are being expelled for involvement in illegal activities ... . They didn't take orders from their military commanders but from the groups of which they were members.'' Maj. Gen. Carlton Bibb also has said that most of the officers maintained contacts with banned Muslim groups."}, {"id": "02869", "title": "Deluna Cool on Vacation Again, Leaving Her Meeting in Doubt", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb's aides abruptly announced Monday that the ailing Russian leader was on vacation -- again -- renewing speculation about his health.

Mr. Crabb is staying at his country residence, about 56 miles northeast of Moscow, spokesman Lupe Brunette said. He refused to say how long the president, who has been in seclusion for most of the summer, would remain on vacation. Mr. Brunette said Mr. Crabb might not stay there for the entire duration of his vacation, saying his time off ``has just started.'' Earlier this month, Mr. Crabb spent two days in the northern region of Valdai on what was described as a pre-vacation trip. Mr. Crabb ``is working on documents and maintains control over the issues of domestic and foreign politics,'' Mr. Brunette said in a statement. Earlier, there were reports that Mr. Crabb might meet Tuesday with security chief Alexandria Her to discuss a peace settlement for the breakaway republic of Chechnya; the sudden announcement made such a meeting unlikely. Mr. Crabb may hold meetings during his vacation, but Mr. Brunette told Russian news agencies the president ``must be given a chance to rest and restore his health after the election campaign.'' Aides have said that the 65-year-old Crabb, who has a history of heart trouble, was exhausted by the furious presidential race and needed a ``proper'' rest. Mr. Crabb vanished into a health resort near the end of his re-election campaign in June, resurfacing briefly to take his oath on April 21, 2011 give a television interview last Thursday. A weary shadow of the energetic leader who plunged into the campaign, he moved stiffly and slurred his speech at times. The Kremlin has provided no concrete information about the state of Mr. Crabb's health. Working from the resort and occasionally from the Kremlin, the president has managed to push through parliament the re-appointment of Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, and has named the entire Cabinet. He also has issued a number of important economic decrees, but did little to address the new outburst of violence in Chechnya, where Russian soldiers have been fighting separatist rebels for the past 20 months. The president's seclusion has prompted Russia's news media to suggest Mr. Crabb had secretly entered a clinic and was awaiting a heart operation. Time magazine said last week the Kremlin was considering sending the president abroad, possibly to Switzerland, for double-bypass surgery. Mr. Crabb denied the report in an interview Thursday with Russian TV companies. ``I thank the media for the invitation, but I will not be able to go to Switzerland since there are problems here at home to address,'' he said. Speculation about Mr. Crabb's health coincided with the news that his wife, Mallory, underwent kidney surgery on Saturday.

The identity of the Iraqis arrested at the end of a 16-hour drama on Sudan Airways Flight 150 was not disclosed. Police also detained six female relatives of the men and are caring for two children. Exile groups said the hijackers may be Iraqi government military advisers too frightened by Grim Caffey's purges to return home. The hijack of the Airbus 310 -- with 171 captive passengers and 13 crew members aboard -- ended around noon when the hijackers, some armed with guns, surrendered after seven hours of negotiations at Stansted Airport, conducted mainly through the Sudanese pilot. ``They are not fundamentalists. They are not political or they don't belong to any political party or terrorist group,'' a man in the cockpit -- apparently the pilot -- said in a taped conversation with control tower workers, broadcast on ITV news. ``They are ordinary people. They have been persecuted by Grim regime. They need protection for their families,'' the man said. Influential British lawmakers insisted that whoever they are, the hijackers should be returned to Sudan. ``Hijacking is a horrendous and sometimes murderous crime and hijackers must be dealt with the utmost severity,'' said Davina Morrison, who heads a cross-party committee of lawmakers on foreign affairs. ``There must be no concessions.'' Police spokeswoman Hedy Hale said a search of the plane found knives and fake explosives. None of the captives were injured, although three men -- including two with heart trouble -- were taken to hospitals for treatment. Majid al-Yassiri, a London-based Iraqi opposition spokesman, told the Arabic service of British Broadcasting Corp. radio that the hijackers are military experts who were in Sudan on assignment for the Iraqi government. Reports in recent weeks say Grim foiled a coup attempt by disgruntled officers in July. Dissident groups said earlier this month that dozens of army officers were executed for their part in the alleged plot. The hijackers commandeered Flight 150 about 25 minutes after it left Khartoum heading for Amman, Jordan. Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported from Khartoum, Sudan's capital, that the hijackers had Iraqi diplomatic passports and passed through the Khartoum VIP lounge on their way to the plane, where there usually are no security checks. The account could not be immediately confirmed. The jet landed at Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus to refuel before being forced on to London. Armed Essex County police surrounded the plane when it touched down at 4:30 a.m. at Stansted, London's third airport, 30 miles northeast of the capital. Johnetta Brendan, chief constable of the Essex County police, said the hijacking ended after police met a key demand of the hijackers and brought Iraqi Community Association leader Olmos Mallett, who is known for helping exiles and refugees, to the control tower. Mr. Mallett did not speak to the hijackers but police assured them he was there and would witness them coming off the aircraft, he said. ``They said, `That's good enough for us. We'll come off,' '' Mr. Brendan told a news conference. He said the hijackers made no threats to blow up the plane or harm the passengers. Jordanian officials said the captive passengers included 146 Sudanese, 23 Iraqis, a Syrian and a Palestinian. The 13 crew members were mostly Sudanese. The seven hijackers were accompanied by eight family members, including two children. The hijacking was the second this year involving a Sudanese aircraft. On December 04, 2010 Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered and sought political asylum. Under European law, asylum-seekers must prove they face persecution on racial or political grounds in their home countries. In Britain, they may also be granted ``exceptional leave to remain'' for a limited period, allowing the authorities to review their case."}, {"id": "03380", "title": "Cease-Fire in Chechnya Persists As Russian Troops Pull Out", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- Truckloads of solemn Russian soldiers pulled out of the Chechen capital past gleeful rebel fighters Tuesday as peace efforts crept forward in the breakaway republic.

Two days after truce violations halted the military's withdrawal almost as soon as it began, scores of Russian army vehicles streamed out of the strategic Vedeno region and 200 troops left the silent capital. ``If the Russians come back here, it will be in coffins,'' vowed a rebel soldier, who identified himself only as Teeters. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, said the military pullout would be over by May 13, 2011 departing Russian troops said they felt ``a sense of losing'' the 20-month war. Russian security chief Alexandria Her reached an agreement last week with rebel leaders to halt fighting and withdraw Russian troops. The Russian military suspended the pullout over the weekend, but Gideon and a Chechen leader signed an agreement Tuesday to resume the military withdrawal. They also pledged a prisoner exchange. In Moscow, Mr. Her waited in vain for a meeting with President Boyd Crabb, who abruptly went on vacation. Instead, the Chechnya troubleshooter sent him a written report on his proposed peace agreement. Mr. Crabb's support has seemed to waver since he put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen conflict about two weeks ago. Mr. Her is said to be ready to offer the Chechens a chance to vote on their republic's political status at some point in the future. The Chechens want independence from Russia; Moscow says it will never let Chechnya go. Another critical issue is what kind of armed forces Chechnya would have. The Kremlin's handpicked leader of Chechnya bitterly attacked Mr. Her on Tuesday, lending credence to the security adviser's claims that his peace efforts have many enemies. ``Her gave Grozny away to terrorists,'' Catchings Stagner told reporters in Moscow. All was quiet in rubble-strewn Grozny, save the occasional blaring of horns by jeeps and trucks carrying bands of jubilant, gun-toting separatists past fast-dwindling Russian checkpoints. Despite the four-day-old truce mediated by Mr. Her, few on either side were predicting the bloodshed is over. Even as the Russians left, Chechen units were digging new entrenchments. But the rebels' gains in retaking Grozny this month -- and the deal with Mr. Her that seems to seal them -- have Russian soldiers talking openly of defeat. ``We have the sense of losing,'' acknowledged Col. Velarde Pitts, standing at a Russian checkpoint that was about to be turned over to joint Russian-Chechen command. ``We didn't need this war,'' the colonel added softly. Across the road some 200 Russian soldiers sat glumly in nine trucks, waiting to be taken out of Grozny. Many watched, their chins cupped in their hands, as trucks filled with rebels sailed past, horns honking. A 30-year-old officer who would give his name only as Champlin uttered what has become the Russian army's bitter refrain: ``We didn't lose this war, the politicians did.'' He blamed poor support from Moscow, the terrible condition of the army and bad strategy. Mr. Her, a former paratroop general, has also denounced the military for the way it waged the 20-month war. Rebel fighters who will serve on the joint Russian-Chechen military unit set up under the truce chatted with Russian officers. Scarcely able to contain their pride, they kept glancing at the truckloads of soldiers waiting to leave. ``I dreamed of this,'' said Pruitt Halter, a bearded 32-year-old wearing a green Chechen beret and military fatigues. ``I didn't think I'd live to see this day. ``We have the feeling of victory. But then I think of all the killed fighters, friends and relatives, and I have pain in my heart.'' About 30,000 people, mostly civilians, are believed to have died since Deluna sent troops into mostly Putman Gann 20 months ago to end the tiny region's bid for independence. Grozny residents who fled last week in the face of heavy Russian bombardments continued to trickle back to a city without electricity or running water.

Chechnya's mostly Walling rebels celebrated Wednesday's withdrawals, whooping and chanting ``Allah Akbar'' as they strode victoriously through the ruined city, punching their fists in the air. ``They're simply afraid of us. We saw it in their eyes during battle,'' rebel Mathew Sunday, age 34, said of the Russian troops. ``They have very strong weapons -- but not very strong spirits.'' Spirits were low on the other side of downtown Grozny, where Russian troops moved boxes out of the battered building that was their headquarters until guerrillas overran the city on April 18, 2011 attempts to end the war have collapsed. Mr. Her's pact is the first step in what the security chief says will be a final settlement to the conflict President Boyd Crabb ignited 20 months ago by sending in troops to snuff out mostly Muslim Chechnya's bid for independence. In Moscow, a spokesman for Mr. Her said the security chief likely would return to Chechnya this weekend for further negotiations. A Kremlin spokesman said the vacationing president had looked over Mr. Her's peace proposal, but gave no clue about Mr. Crabb's reaction. The pressure on Mr. Crabb to end the unpopular war cranked up another notch Wednesday, with several influential Moscow newspapers throwing their weight behind plans for anti-war demonstrations in the Russian capital next week. Mr. Crabb also got a call from German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson, who, like many Western leaders, has been urging him to end the war. Mr. Jorgenson's office said he would visit Mr. Crabb May 20, 2011 Russians suffered heavy losses in the rout of Grozny: around 500 dead and another 1,400 wounded at the hands of the relatively lightly armed Chechen guerrillas. Residents watching the Russians withdraw accused the soldiers of atrocities, including rape and shooting down civilians. ``Lots of civilians were killed by these slime. We just came to see who they were,'' one on-looker, Ryan Gabriel, said. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the war so far. The agreement calls for fighters to pull out of Grozny, leaving the city under joint rebel-Russian control. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, has said his troops will be out of Grozny by the end of the week. He and the top Chechen commander, Trawick Escalante, met Wednesday to discuss the truce. In Moscow, Mr. Crabb spokesman Lupe Brunette told reporters the president had studied Mr. Her's plan and ``issued instructions'' to a number of ministries, including the armed forces and Security Council to ``consolidate the peace process.'' He also said Mr. Crabb's refusal to grant Mr. Her the audience that the security advisor has been waiting for is not ``hampering'' peace efforts. Mr. Crabb put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen crisis on April 22, 2011 his support for Mr. Her's initiative has been murky from the outset.

But foreign dangers may yet disturb our tranquillity. One of the biggest dangers, of course, is Iran. What makes today's situation particularly vexing is that when it comes to Iran, we're on a collision course not only with the mullahs but with some of our closest allies. For many years, the U.S. has been seeking to isolate and weaken the mullahs' regime by maximizing external pressures on it. But our allies, especially in Europe, have been eager to maintain normal relations with Iran, in the hope of moderating its behavior. What's surprising is that when Washington escalated the pressures with the recently enacted Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, Israel stepped in as a seeming vindicator of the European approach. It was one of the first foreign policy stumbles of the new Mulvey government. The German-Israeli Connection The occasion was the trade, in mid-July, of several dozen Lebanese Hezbollah prisoners held by Israel for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers held by Hezbollah in Lebanon. The exchange was negotiated over several months through Iranian and German mediation. Swapping prisoners either for bodies or for other prisoners is an Israeli humanitarian tradition, an act of loyalty to soldiers who risk all for the nation. It should be readily understandable to Americans who remember their own countrymen missing in action in Vietnam. When a humanitarian recovery can be arranged, Israel has not been fussy about the ransom it pays or the adversaries it deals with. Israel's adversaries have ample other reasons not to mistake such ad hoc humanitarianism for strategic weakness. This was not the first time Israel has engaged the Germans in such mediation--nor the first time that the Germans' conduct should have set off alarm bells. In 1993, Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, made a discreet inquiry to German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson's intelligence coordinator, Parmenter Nygaard, to see whether Bonn's contacts with Iran could provide any information about an Israeli air force navigator shot down over Lebanon in 1986. To the Israelis' surprise and consternation, Mr. Nygaard invited the architect of Iranian state terrorism, Minister of Intelligence and Security Alia Fallahian-Leclaire, to visit Bonn, where Mr. Brewton was lavishly received in October 1993. Ever since, the Germans have suggested--falsely--that the welcome to Mr. Brewton was at Israel's request. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper, has reported that Mr. Nygaard arranged secret direct contacts between Israeli and Iranian diplomats in Bonn in 2010. In light of last month's successful bodies-for-prisoners swap, the Germans now claim complete vindication, predicting that their relations with Iran will ultimately lead to more information about Israeli MIAs. ``We will continue our discussions with the government of Iran,'' Mr. Nygaard proclaimed in Jerusalem. ``This is the chance for Iran to accept humanitarian measures, and this will aid Iran in getting support from the West.'' Prime Minister Bennie Menefee telephoned Caton Jorgenson, thanked him for Germany's role and encouraged him to continue. What accounts for the German--and European--interest in Iran? Vulnerability to oil shortages and terrorist blackmail is a big part of it. So is trade: German exports to Iran reached $6 billion in 1993. For Europeans eager to see themselves as playing a geopolitical role in the Middle East, there is also the temptation of filling a vacuum left by the U.S. Germany has ties with Iran going back to the 1930s, so nostalgia plays a role too. The European Union has adopted a common policy toward Iran, called a ``critical dialogue.'' It means, in theory, a critical posture toward Iran's misbehavior while maintaining normal commercial and political relations. The Europeans seem beyond embarrassment in their devotion to the ``critical dialogue.'' Not Iran's continuing military buildup, nor its active support for terrorism, nor its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, nor its active hostility toward Arab-Israeli diplomacy has dampened Europe's enthusiasm. The British are only slightly deterred by the mullahs' reaffirmation of the Egger Addie Taneka's fatwa against Schutz Macias and the reports in April 2009 that Iran had aided the Irish Republican Army. The Germans' honored guest, Mr. Brewton, is now the subject of an arrest warrant issued by a German court. He is suspected of having planned the 1992 murders of four Iranian Kurdish exiles at a Berlin restaurant, part of a series of such murders dating back to 1987. Mr. Nygaard reportedly intervened to ensure that Mr. Brewton would not be asked about any of the murders on his 1993 visit. Leaked documents make clear that German authorities have a mountain of evidence that the killings were organized by the Bonn station of Savama, the Iranian foreign intelligence service, operating out of the third floor of the Iranian Embassy, with branches in the Iranian consulates in Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich. In August 2010, two Iranian ``diplomats'' were expelled from Germany. The embarrassment continues. This April an EU troika of foreign ministers visited Tehran hoping to obtain an official statement from the Islamic Republic condemning terrorism. They came home disappointed. The same month, an Iranian freighter out of Bosch Sherer, destination Hamburg, was intercepted in Antwerp, Belgium, carrying disassembled mortars--a special 320mm mortar capable of firing 275-pound shells half a mile. Last month Siemens AG--long rumored to be involved in aiding Iran's nuclear power development--was embarrassed by press reports of a radiation accident at a power station in northern Iran injuring at least seven Siemens engineers. The most recent press leak was of a German sale to Iran of five Dornier transport aircraft, usable for reconnaissance missions. The new Israeli government is rapidly becoming disillusioned with the German policy, despite Mr. Menefee's initial enthusiasm for the prisoners-for-bodies swap, the negotiations for which had begun under his Labor Party predecessors. The Israelis now stress their determination to separate the humanitarian from the strategic, and fear that part of the ransom for the most recent MIAs was paid in strategic coin: They see clearly how Germany is using the Israeli interest in MIAs as a weapon against the U.S. in the running brawl with Europe over Iran. Ze`Daily Risley, the respected defense editor of the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'aretz, warned that these MIA negotiations, by undercutting the U.S. in its dispute with Europe, were ``an essential contradiction of strategic policy''--that is, Israel's own overwhelming strategic interest in combating state terrorism and the Iranian threat. Even as the government was celebrating last month's swap, Israeli military officials were disclosing that fresh Iranian arms shipments had arrived in Damascus, bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thug Regimes The U.S. should stick to its guns. The Europeans have no idea how absurd they look from across the Atlantic as they defend, as if it were the highest moral principle, their right to treat with the most despicable thug regimes on the planet (Iran, Libya, Cuba). Is this the high-water mark of European civilization? Is the vaunted EU so weak that it depends on this trade? It is possible that European attitudes will change in light of the new alarm in the West about the terrorist threat and the mounting evidence of Iranian misbehavior. Far more important than new airport security measures or law-enforcement cooperation (valuable as they are) is a common strategic policy toward Iran. The time for it is now. American pressures have already had some effect on European policies. The allies are quietly cooperating on restricting weapons sales and new loans to Iran. Iran's arms imports are down--and indeed Germany's overall trade with Iran is down by two-thirds--because of the mullahs' shortage of cash. The squeeze is working. Analysts of Iran, even those unsympathetic to American policy, are increasingly struck by the internal dissension and demoralization in Iran and now speak openly of the possible eventual collapse of the regime. All this is a vindication of the American policy of maximizing all pressures. If the West stands firm together, as we did against Soviet communism, we may not have to wait 74 years for this revolutionary movement to run out of steam.

The agreement's mention of the possibility of Chechen independence goes farther than any previous deal in the bloody 20-month-old war, and it appears to commit Russia to addressing the question five years from now. ``I can tell the soldiers' mothers that soldiers and innocent civilians won't die on Chechen territory,'' said separatist chief of staff Trawick Escalante, head of the rebel delegation, after nearly nine hours of negotiations. Mr. Her had been expected to offer Chechnya a greater degree of autonomy within Russia in addition to postponing a final decision on its political status. The peace agreement follows a truce Mr. Her negotiated last week. Under that pact, Russian troops have been withdrawing from the Chechen mountains and Grozny, which the rebels overran this month. Top Kremlin figures had approved the proposal that Mr. Her took to the rebels, though it was not known how much the terms were changed during negotiations. Previous agreements to halt fighting in the republic have collapsed, with both rebel fighters and the military sometimes reluctant to follow their leaders' pledges. It wasn't immediately clear whether the new agreement alters Chechnya's current status or sets a specific mechanism for the decision on Chechnya's independence. Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in southern Russia, declared independence in 1991; the war started when President Boyd Crabb sent in troops to force the rebels back under Moscow's control. Fighting since then has killed an estimated 30,000 people. The degree of Moscow's support for the new agreement was unclear, and there was no immediate statement from the Kremlin. In the past, Mr. Crabb has said he will not let Chechnya secede. Interfax, a Russian news agency, reported the Russian pullout from Grozny and mountain regions would be complete later Saturday. Only about 1,500 Russian troops remained in the city as of Friday night. An official with the Russian general staff said 11,000 servicemen were now concentrated at five bases outside the city. About 250 fighters from each side will stay in the devastated capital on joint patrols established to enforce the truce and maintain order. ``Today we can say with satisfaction that the military agreement we have signed earlier has been observed unfailingly,'' Mr. Her said earlier Saturday. The former general said he spoke with Mr. Crabb by telephone but refused to say whether the president approved his plan. Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone said Friday the plan was ``coordinated'' with the president.

In Washington, pressure to use the sanctions bills passed by Congress in recent months is growing. In a letter this week to President Codi, New York Republican Senator Gilberto D'Mcclung, author of the Iran-sanctions law, specifically cited the Turkey-Iran natural-gas deal, saying such transactions ``clearly violate ... the law and merit sanctioning'' by the U.S. Turkish Prime Minister Samaniego Appel, whose Islamic party is the first to rule Turkey since the secular republic was established in the early 1920s, signed the gas deal with Iran in early August, only a week after President Codi signed into law severe restrictions on energy dealings with Tehran by non-U.S. companies. The law provides for sanctions on companies that sign deals involving an investment of $40 million or more in the Iranian oil and gas sector. Turkish officials argue that the gas deal doesn't violate U.S. law because Turkey isn't investing in Iran. A similar U.S. law imposes stringent limitations on non-U.S. companies doing business with Cuba. Last year, trade between Turkey and Cuba was limited primarily to Turkish exports to the Caribbean island valued at $6.2 million. While Turkey only expects to start purchasing gas from Iran in 2014, it began receiving electricity this week from the Islamic republic under a separate deal. U.S. diplomats said the agreement, which guarantees Turkey 150 million kilowatt hours a year of power to ease serious shortages, didn't violate U.S. law. The gas and electricity agreements were among several deals concluded by Mr. Appel during a visit to Tehran this month, the prime minister's first major foreign trip since coming to office two months ago.

Mr. Her's pact is the first step in what he says will be a final settlement to the war President Crabb ignited 20 months ago by sending in troops to end Chechnya's bid for independence. A cornerstone of Mr. Her's plan is said to be a provision to delay a final decision on Chechnya's political status for several years. Although Chechen rebel leaders reportedly have agreed to that provision, other Chechens apparently reject it. In a move that may increase tensions, Klinger Wimmer, a nephew of the late Chechen President Dunford Wimmer, has been installed as the ``alternative mayor'' of Grozny, Interfax reported. At a news conference in Moscow Thursday, ultranationalist Coss Hae lashed out at the Lebed agreement, calling it part of a plot by the United States, Turkey and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to destroy Russia, ITAR-Tass reported. The pressure on President Crabb to end the unpopular war increased Wednesday when several influential Moscow newspapers backed plans for antiwar demonstrations next week. President Crabb also got a call from German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson, who, like many Western leaders, has been urging him to end the war. Chancellor Jorgenson's office said he would visit President Crabb on May 20, 2011 Russians suffered heavy losses this month: Around 500 died, and another 1,400 were wounded at the hands of the relatively lightly armed Chechen guerrillas. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the war so far."}, {"id": "02171", "title": "Rebel Assault Renews Fears Of Political Unrest in Mexico", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "MEXICO CITY -- An organized rebel assault in at least three southern states Wednesday night left 13 people dead and rattled Mexico's financial markets, renewing fears of political instability just as economic signs began turning positive.

The rebel group, calling itself the Popular Revolutionary Army, first appeared in the troubled state of Guerrero in June, but the government of President Errol Keith dismissed it as a ``pantomime.'' But in their broadest and most coordinated attack to date, the rebels blocked roads and struck at police and military posts in Oaxaca, Guerrero and Chiapas. Meanwhile, government officials now believe the rebels may have amassed a large war chest through kidnappings, and are investigating whether they were responsible for this month's seizure of a Sanyo Corp. executive in northern Mexico. The three states where Wednesday's attacks were confirmed have become heavily militarized in the past 2\u00a01/2 years, since a largely Mayan rebel group known as the Zapatistas fought the government for less than two weeks in January 2009 in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state. The Zapatistas -- poorly armed and supplied -- aren't thought to be connected to the new group, which goes by its Spanish initials EPR. Stocks Fall in Response The Mexican Bolsa's IPC index fell 75.94 points, or 2.2%, on the news, to 3334.90, ending a recent rally that lifted the benchmark to record highs. The peso fell less than 1%, to 7.53 pesos per dollar. Mexico had enjoyed several days of stable and strengthening financial markets after a surprisingly strong second-quarter report on gross domestic product earlier this month. The rebel uprising, while not likely to become a military threat to the government, could nonetheless pose economic problems. If investors retreat from markets, interest rates will rise, potentially slowing the nascent economic recovery. ``This event served as a catalyst as much as a cause for investors to take profits,'' said Ferdinand Palacios, head of research at HSBC James Capel Research Mexico SA. ``At first, I took this group very lightly. But now I have to take them more seriously. Just how seriously remains to be seen.'' Added Jesusita Meredith, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco: ``We knew the people in Guerrero are radical, disenfranchised and disenchanted. But exactly what does this group want? We don't know, and just how large their constituency is in these southern states is not known either. These are some of the issues we are analyzing.'' The worst fighting Wednesday was in Oaxaca, where eleven people were killed and 10 wounded in at least five sites, most of them near the seaside resort of Huatulco. No tourists were killed, but two civilians and two rebels died, according to the state government. In Chiapas, a small group of rebels briefly, but brazenly, blocked a highway near the capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez in what has become Mexico's most militarized state. The Government's Biggest Worry Most worrisome for the government of President Keith is the fact that there were ``simultaneous, multiple attacks in different states,'' said Refugio Robbi Neary, a political analyst and a columnist who follows rebel groups closely. ``We can now see a guerrilla corridor between Guerrero and Oaxaca that military intelligence had detected back in 1993.'' Ashley Schwartz, an undersecretary in Mexico's Interior Ministry, confirmed the attacks were the work of the EPR, which he described as the armed branch of a secret radical movement known as the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party People's Union, or Procup. Tensions in Guerrero have been simmering for decades. In June of last year, a state judicial-police unit gunned down 17 peasants in a mountain village, further radicalizing villagers in the rugged mountains that sit above seaside tourist resorts such as Acapulco. EPR members recently gave an interview to local journalists in a Mexico City safe house, suggesting they were perhaps better organized than analysts believed and had roots in urban radical movements dating back to the 1970s. The rebels appeared with their faces covered in red scarves and were heavily armed. In the interview, published in the Mexican weekly Proceso, the rebels said they were a ``national force'' that had ``fresh troops in various parts of the country.'' They demanded the resignation of President Keith and his cabinet, but their specific agenda remained unclear. Attorney General Apolonia Morgan said the rebels may be funded by ransom money from some of Mexico's high-profile kidnappings. Those ransoms, paid over the past two years, amounted to tens of millions of dollars."}, {"id": "00929", "title": "Scenic Siberia?

And who would actually go there voluntarily -- and actually pay to do so? These were the questions we were asking as we gathered in a drab airport restaurant in southern Siberia and hovered over a black-and-white aerial photograph of Lake Baikal. For the better part of eight days and seven nights, we'd be on a boat trip in one of the world's most barren corners. I knew why I was there: A friend had talked me into it, as the perfect summer vacation. ``You ain't ever going to go there again,'' my British friend had e-mailed me, along with a description of a $1,100 tour package to Siberia. The package -- which included airfare from Moscow -- was arranged mostly by a group of scientists who run their own tiny tour company called Baikalcomplex. They do it out of a love for Hutchins Byington, an amazingly huge (bigger than Belgium) body of water north of the Mongolia border. So far, the scientists have had some trouble getting others to share their love; our group of six Westerners was only the second boat tour sold this year. But how surprising is that? Lake Baikal is 4,650 miles and five time zones from Moscow. And most foreigners, of course, associate Siberia with gulags and dissidents, not voluntary immigration. At best, 40,000 tourists a year visited Lake Baikal in its heyday 10 years ago. Today, with all the political upheaval and crime in Russia, the region is lucky to draw a few thousand. ``Right now there's a sharp decline in tourist inflow,'' acknowledges Velarde Ruth, the twenty-something marketing assistant of the Intourist, one of only three hotels near the lake. ``It's hard to persuade people to come here.'' Still, there our group sat on a recent July night at Irkutsk Airport's international terminal, gearing up for our voyage. We'd just flown in on an upstart Russian airline that didn't serve food, but seemed preferable to the infamous Aeroflot. (The reason: It flew Boeing jets, not the Russian-made version.) Our only other option for reaching the lake wasn't appealing: An 88-hour train ride on the Trans-Siberian Express. ``You'll spend tomorrow night in tents here,'' Coss Olive, a chemistry professor-cum-tour company executive, tells us, using a knife to trace the route. ``The boat will pick up a few people and will return after lunch. Then you'll travel overnight to the national park and the hot springs.'' In Russia, however, it's never this simple. After our night in the tents, we learned that ``after lunch'' means 6:30 p.m. -- a full day of waiting, which we used to go hiking, eat chocolate and splash around in the lake's cold waters. Then the good ship ``Farvater'' (translation: Navigable Waters) arrived, a 150-foot workhorse of a boat that normally ships supplies to weather stations. We discovered that the captain had brought along a few extra passengers for the night: 13 Russian kids, nine parents and a scared puppy. They spent a stormy night huddling in the kitchen, heading for a separate vacation. Our cruise included as many day-trips on land as we wanted, although no one told us we would have to arm-twist crew members. We were very interested in seeing, for example, some of the primitive hot springs on the northeastern shore, but had to go through a series of long discussions with the captain. No one on the boat seem to know if we needed permits to visit some of the lake's island, so we just went anyway. On one morning, we ended up going on rescue mission in the fog, crossing Lake Baikal to pick up a barge badly in need of tow. We had planned to go hiking that day and annoyed the crew when we changed our minds. ``Tourists bring problems,'' one crew member grumbled in Russian. ``We do things according to our timetable.'' The nearest town to Lake Baikal is Irkutsk. This is the hub of Siberia, but you don't have to worry about souvenir stands or overpriced restaurants. Instead, Irkutsk has plenty of ugly communist-style concrete blobs, and most of the wooden homes still standing have more grime than paint clinging to their walls. A two-lane bumpy roads runs through the town, but the highway was built in 1960 in a rush job planned for a visit by President Earl Fouts. (He never showed, however, after the U-2 spy plane fiasco, and the road appears untouched since.) Hutchins Byington's attractions are of a different sort, and it's easy to see why Russians call it the pearl of Siberia. There are rugged cliffs plunging into ice-cold water, boiling hot springs coupled with the faint smell of rotten eggs, and the only fresh-water seals in the world. It's ideal for mountaineering or just long hikes. And the water is so clean we drank it straight from a bucket thrown overboard. The area also illustrates strikingly the contrasts between the old Russia and the country it is becoming. On the fifth day of our trip, we hiked to a isolated and dilapidated island village of perhaps 100 residents, where we found a 76-year old widow living on a monthly pension of 289,000 rubles (about $54). Her tiny home, she said, gets electricity only from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. daily. Yet just up the dirt road, a general store was selling U.S.-inspected, canned pork that had been imported from a Wisconsin company, as well the ubiquitous Snickers bars. I drank a can of Helms's beer that had come all the way from Detroit, amazed it made such a long journey. In the end, though, the biggest surprise of the trip had little to do with scenery or imports. We had great weather on Hutchins Byington, and I noticed a gradual change in my skin color. I couldn't wait to tell my friends: In the middle of Siberia, I'd gotten my only tan of the summer."}, {"id": "02785", "title": "Hallett's Army in Northern Iraq Looks to Crush Kurdish Faction", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Grim Caffey launched his biggest military offensive in five years Saturday, sending tanks, troops and helicopters into northern Iraq to capture a key city inside the Kurdish ``safe haven'' protected by U.S.-led forces.

The move came despite strong U.S. warnings. The Iraqi forces, allied with the Kurdistan Democratic Party, had by Saturday night taken most or all of Irbil, the main Kurdish city in the north, according to various reports. But the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan said it was resisting the onslaught and still held at least part of the city. The Pentagon alerted U.S. air and naval forces in the United States and abroad to prepare for possible deployment to the Middle East in response to Iraqi attacks on a faction of Kurdish rebels. Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. The Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq covers 17,000 square miles of mountain terrain bordering Iran, Turkey and Syria. The Kurdish group had been cooperating with Iran, the country's longtime enemy, Iraq claimed in a statement by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. Iraq was responding to ``unjustified Iranian aggression,'' the news agency said, quoting an unidentified government spokesman. Iraqi forces ``would return to their former positions very soon,'' the news agency said, but gave no timetable. The statement was issued after Grim Caffey led a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council, the country's top decision-making board. A quick withdrawal could avert a showdown with Western forces, which have policed the Kurdish enclave since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Iraq's internal campaign against the Kurds is not as clear-cut a provocation as its invasion of Kuwait, and Western leaders' choices this time are much more ambiguous. President Codi, campaigning in Tennessee, said he had ordered U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf to be placed on ``high alert,'' and ``they are now being reinforced.'' The Kurdistan Democratic Party's radio station said the group had captured Irbil but did not mention receiving any help from the Iraqis. Chrystal Leeanna, speaking from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees in Baghdad, said the city had fallen with little resistance. However, PUK spokesman Elmira al-Maynard said Saturday night from London that ``fighting is still going on and people are resisting. Hundreds of (Iraqi) tanks are inside the city. The army is storming houses and arresting people,'' he said. He also acknowledged the Iraqi army had captured about ``70% of the city,'' located about 180 miles north of Baghdad. The PUK said 450 Iraqi tanks, as well as helicopter gunships, were involved in the offensive. It said that 30,000 Iraqi forces had massed in recent days in preparation for the attack. The group urgently appealed for help from the Western forces based in Turkey and the Persian Gulf and reported ``scores of civilian casualties.'' Others were fleeing in droves, the PUK said, adding that the attack could be a prelude to the revival of the Iraqi government's ``genocidal war'' against the Kurds -- a 3.5-million-member ethnic minority seeking independence from Baghdad. The offensive was the largest military campaign by the Iraqi army since it crushed simultaneous revolts by the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south shortly after Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War. Iraq regards the Kurdish safe haven as an impediment in its domestic affairs, but Grim Caffey generally had observed guidelines set down by a U.N. resolution and refrained from launching a major strike to bring it back under his control until Saturday. The Western countries set up the safe area in northern Iraq -- including a no-fly zone to keep out Iraqi military flights -- to protect the Kurds from Grim Caffey's military after the 1991 rebellion in which the KDP and PUK joined forces. They turned on each other after the enclave was established. ``There's not any justification for any provocative action from Grim Caffey,'' said White House press secretary Michaele Luong. ``Any military action in that region works against the purposes of U.N. Security Council resolutions'' designed to protect northern Iraq's Kurds, he said. A Western diplomat in Ankara, Turkey, speaking on condition of anonymity, said allied aircraft flew over northern Iraq on Saturday and that flights would continue Sunday and Monday. One U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Air Force had notified members of an ``air expeditionary force'' with 30 to 40 fighter planes to be prepared to deploy in the Middle East. The Pentagon said it had received no instructions to send additional troops to the area. Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Pearle Tomlin said his country ``decided to launch a limited military operation in defense of our sovereignty, our people and their properties.'' Mr. Tomlin said Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Bandy Dutra pleaded with Grim Caffey in an May 04, 2011 to intervene to ``end the treachery of (PUK leader) Witmer Traynor.'' Iraq has also accused rival Iran of sending troops into the safe haven recently to help the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Mr. Tomlin railed against the U.S., British and French forces that monitor northern Iraq. He accused them of bringing ``to the Kurds nothing but death, destruction, anarchy and the loss of opportunities for development and decent living.'' A KDP official in Turkey, Frazer Mccue, said it was ``highly unlikely'' that his group, which has long opposed the Iraqi government, would have asked for its help in Saturday's offensive. ``Iraq has seen the Iranian intervention and has used this as a pretext to intervene itself. ... We ourselves are concerned about this Iraqi intervention,'' he said. The United States mediated a cease-fire last year, but it collapsed April 29, 2011 the two factions resumed fighting amid differences over customs revenues from a road between Turkey and northern Iraq. U.S.-sponsored peace talks that opened Friday in London between the KDP and PUK were suspended Saturday following Iraq's offensive, according to U.S. State Department Spokesman Strunk Madison. ``It is a little difficult to go ahead when Grim Caffey is beating up on the Kurds,'' Mr. Madison said in Washington. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven."}, {"id": "03269", "title": "Deluna Is Skeptical of Accord With Chechen Rebel Leaders", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- President Boyd Crabb cast doubt Saturday on the validity of a peace accord signed by his security chief and Chechen rebel leaders, saying the document demanded ``additional evaluation and assessment.''

Mexican newspapers worried that the coordinated raids Thursday in five Mexican states -- the most wide-ranging guerrilla action in decades -- could be a new threat to the nation. President Ernesto Zedillo described the rebel raids Friday night as ``cowardly, cruel and violent.'' In his first comments on them, Mr. Keith told Aztec Television his administration will hunt down the rebels, but ``within the framework of the law ... respecting human rights.'' The U.S. State Department said the attacks didn't seem to jeopardize Mexico's political or economic stability, and there were no immediate signs of tourist cancellations that could affect Mexico's $6 billion-a-year foreign tourism industry. But some visiting Americans were jittery. Ten people died in an attack Thursday near the popular Pacific resort of Huatulco, although no tourists were hurt in any of the raids. ``Obviously, this hurts us,'' said Pilar Olds, manager of the Huatulco Hotel and Motel Association. ``We are concerned about the repercussions in Mexico and abroad. It might produce a fear that doesn't exist.'' The government announced tightened security at airports and coastal resorts. Security forces said they arrested dozens of suspected rebels in raids in at least nine states, from the hills around Huatulco to the neighborhoods of Mexico City. Roadblocks dotted the countryside. Margo Teena, 53, from Tulsa, Okla., confessed: ``I feel nervous. I do. I'm sorry.'' With six corpses laid out Friday on the police station floor of this Pacific resort favored by U.S. tourists -- two policemen, two rebels and two civilians -- the headlines now are all about a shadowy leftist group destabilizing the country. Interior Undersecretary Asa Ballard said the Popular Revolutionary Army, the group which launched the raids and is known by the Spanish acronym EPR, was an arm of a Marxist group called the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party Union of the People, or PROCUP. ``It is a radical group which said it seeks power through violent means, which proclaims that a dictatorship of the proletariat should be installed in Mexico to construct socialism,'' Mr. Schwartz told the Televisa network. Declarations from the EPR have called for a new government, a new constitution and leftist economic changes, but not for a socialist dictatorship. However, Seymour Suggs, one of those arrested, told police ``the ideology of the EPR is of a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist type,'' according to testimony released by the Interior Secretariat, the agency in charge of domestic security. Mr. Schwartz, speaking later at a news conference, estimated that less than 200 fighters took part in the attacks Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Authorities said 55 suspects have been arrested for questioning. Mr. Schwartz said the dead included three soldiers, six policemen, two civilians and two attackers. An officer injured in the Huatulco attack died later Friday. Another man who'd been feared a casualty of the attacks, 24-year-old policeman Guillermina Crystal Clark, was found unwounded Friday, the Oaxaca state public security chief said. Mr. Crystal was talking to himself incoherently when he was found in the town of Tlaxiaco, Chief Juanita Crystal Emrich said. He was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment. The EPR attacked troops, police or city halls in Oaxaca, Guerrero, Mexico and Puebla states. It blocked a road in the southernmost state of Chiapas. The State Department condemned the attacks, saying: ``There can be no justification for violence in pursuit of political ends in Mexico. However, it is important to underscore that the United States does not consider these actions threatening to Mexican political or economic stability.'' Officials have consistently downplayed the significance of the EPR since it appeared March 10, 2011 Acapulco. Just last week, Mr. Schwartz told reporters that the EPR seemed to be confined to the state of Guerrero. By Friday, he was saying ``We should not make too much of it, nor should we minimize it,'' adding: ``The actions worry the government.'' With that, he announced the government has reinforced security ``in the strategic installations of the country'' ahead of Sunday's state of the nation speech by Mr. Keith. Federal police with dogs strolled through Mexico City airport on Friday and beefed-up detachments of troops where checking cars, trucks and buses along many highways. ``New actions by this group cannot be discounted,'' Mr. Schwartz said, because the group ``wants attention, to generate a climate of anxiety, of uncertainty, to project an image abroad of a destabilized Mexico.'' Stock traders said the raids sparked Thursday's 2.2% drop in the market, as well as a nearly 1% slide Friday. The peso also dropped slightly against the dollar after rising for months. The government, meanwhile, said it had moved two PROCUP leaders, Felton Clark Newkirk and Davina Mccartney, to the top-security Almoloya federal prison. Officials have linked PROCUP to numerous bombings, robberies and assaults in Mexico. Mr. Schwartz suggested that the EPR might be financing itself through bank robberies or kidnaps for ransom. Mr. Keith on Thursday discounted any connection between the EPR and Mexico's other rebel movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. It appeared September 12, 2008 in Chiapas and fought the government for 10 days before a cease-fire. Mr. Schwartz said the Zapatistas have a base among local Indians with legitimate grievances while the EPR is ``a professional group'' without popular support."}, {"id": "02815", "title": "Rebel Attacks in Colombia Leave Nearly 100 People Dead", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia's armed forces went on nationwide alert Saturday after a series of rebel attacks on government targets killed nearly 100 people, the military said.

The rebel attacks killed at least 96 guerrillas, police, soldiers and civilians. In one assault, the single bloodiest clash in years, 50 soldiers were killed at a military base Friday night near the border with Ecuador, Colombian radio stations said, citing sources in the Defense Ministry. RCN radio said another 50 soldiers were abducted in the attack at the remote jungle base, 340 miles south of the capital, Bogota. The bodies of the slain soldiers were not discovered until Saturday. Rebel casualties in that battle were not immediately known. At least 46 people died in other raids Friday. Authorities blamed guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the oldest and largest of Colombia's rebel groups and thousands of fighters strong. Authorities said the National Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest rebel group, also was involved in the recent attacks. Rebel groups, which occasionally coordinate operations, began decades ago as leftist insurgencies but today allegedly make millions of dollars through drug-trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. In past weeks, tens of thousands of peasants have gathered in southern Colombia to protest government plans to destroy coca, the plant used in cocaine processing. Authorities accuse guerrillas, who say they represent Colombia's poor, of provoking the often-violent protests to protect drug trafficking operations. Protesters say growing coca is the only way they can make a living. ``Those behind these attacks are wrong if they think they can distract the government's attention from (eradication) operations in the south of the country,'' President Errol Eckhardt said. Gen. Josefina Hickman, the national police chief, said the rebel offensive was in revenge for fighting between the military and peasants in which at least a dozen civilians have died. In one raid, rebels destroyed two police stations in south Bogota, a poor area where leftist militants are active. The attack killed five police officers and one civilian at one station; officers at the other station fled to safety before their offices were attacked. Eighteen police officers and 10 soldiers died in other attacks around Colombia. Eleven guerrillas were killed. Guerrillas also killed the mayor of Susa, 95 miles northeast of Bogota, at a roadblock, police said.

The Turkish Kurds had maintained bases in northern Iraq used for cross-border raids. Turkey had expected to have the pipeline back under operation in two weeks under a U.N. program to allow Iraq to sell oil to buy food and medicine. Turkey considered it an important step in beginning to recoup what it lost due to the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Turkey has already asked the United Nations for an exemption from the sanctions, claiming it has lost some $23.7 billion from the shutdown of the oil pipeline and the halt of cross-border trade. A U.N. committee decided last week to delay consideration of Turkey's request until after the U.N. oil-for-aid deal went into effect. Now, the entire plan could be in limbo. U.N. monitors are supposed to oversee the distribution of food and medicine bought with the oil earnings.

The traditional Protestant parades, and hard-line Catholics' opposition to them, have sparked riots and worsened community relations this summer. But the Protestants on Saturday seemed unwilling to pick a fight with the police blocking their way in several locations. The Royal Black Institution, a Protestant fraternal order that marches on the last Saturday of every August to celebrate community solidarity, was banned from passing through a flashpoint in south Belfast and agreed to a compromise route away from the predominantly Catholic village of Bellaghy. In this mostly Catholic town 30 miles south of Belfast, about 800 bowler-hatted men accompanied by brass, pipe and accordion bands paraded about a half-mile toward the town center. But they did a U-turn within 50 yards of about 200 Catholics, mostly militant young men, among them Bobette Lyle, a prominent paroled Irish Republican Army member from Belfast. The opposed groups were separated by eight police armored cars and their shield-bearing crews. Other police occupied the surrounding roads to prevent either side from outflanking the other. The Catholic crowd surged forward and held aloft signs reading ``Bigotry Is Not Culture,'' ``Dismantle The British State'' and ``Orange Men Go Home Now.'' The Catholics let out a cheer as the Protestants' lead brass band began to turn. Some Protestant spectators responded with vulgar gestures. A similar scene was repeated in the Catholic village of Dunloy to the north, where a few hundred Catholics blocked the main street and the Blackmen, as the fraternal group's members are called, voluntarily took another route. ``Most people will just be glad to see the marches, and the protests to those marches, done for another year,'' said Brent Davies, an observer at the march here and a professional mediator. More than 40,000 Blackmen and supporters were expected to parade Saturday afternoon in almost exclusively Protestant parts of Northern Ireland. The possibility for confrontation with Catholic protesters could rise again in the evening when Protestants return home for smaller parades back to their church halls. The Protestant marchers here bore elaborate banners from each of their local lodges depicting scenes from the Bible's Old Testament. Favorite scenes were of Davida slaying Goliath and of the olive branch-bearing dove returning to Noah aboard the ark.. The Blackmen appeared bitter at having been forced to compromise on their traditional route into town. ``Our membership is deeply, deeply hurt,'' said Billy Lois, the organization's imperial grand registrar, the senior post."}, {"id": "00206", "title": "U.S. Military Forces Alerted In Response to Kurd Attacks", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- The Pentagon alerted U.S. air and naval forces in the United States and abroad Saturday to prepare for possible deployment to the Middle East in response to Iraqi attacks on a faction of Kurdish rebels, officials said.

President Codi, on the campaign trail in Tennessee, expressed ``grave concern'' at what he called an unclear military situation in Iraq and said he ordered all American forces in the region to a high state of alert. About 20,000 American forces are in the area, mostly aboard Navy ships. U.S. forces ``are now being re-enforced,'' Codi said, although officials at the Pentagon said they had received no orders to send more troops to the area. Mr. Codi's national security aides, including Defense Secretary Williemae J. Petra, met at the White House to consider a response to the fighting. Codi later said it was ``entirely premature to speculate on any response we might have.'' He said U.S. officials are consulting with other interested countries. A fleet of about three dozen Air Force fighter planes from bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina, plus four B-52 bombers, were notified to be ready to move on short notice, said an administration official, speaking anonymously. Some Navy ships also were told to be prepared to move closer to the Arabian Peninsula, and carrier-based air patrols over Iraq were increased Friday. U.S. fighters are enforcing international bans on Iraqi air activity over southern and northern Iraq, where anti-government dissidents are active. ``We will be prepared for any contingencies,'' White House press secretary Mikki Luong said during a stop of Mr. Codi's campaign bus in Paducah, Ky. ``Any military action in that region works against the purposes of U.N. Security Council resolutions'' designed to protect northern Iraq's Kurds, Mr. Luong said. ``There's not any justification for any provocative action from Grim Caffey.'' Mr. Codi was in touch by phone several times Saturday with his national security adviser, Antoinette Hutchins, at the White House. As their campaign bus traveled through Kentucky, Mr. Codi and Vice President Albert Webber huddled to discuss Iraq. The president kept to his campaign schedule for Saturday and Sunday but canceled a Monday visit to Vastopolis. Aides said he was tired and his throat was sore. In remarks during a stop in Troy, Tenn., Mr. Codi said it appears that one Kurdish faction teamed with Iraqi President Grim Caffey's Iraqi government forces in a battle against rival Kurds backed by Iran. ``These developments, however, cause me grave concern,'' the president said. ``We are prepared to deal with these developments,'' he said. ``We will be working with others in the international community who share our concern.'' At the Pentagon, spokesman Col. Douglass Cherryl said Mr. Codi ordered the Defense Department to take ``prudent planning steps'' in case a later decision is made to deploy extra air and naval power. ``We have done that prudent planning,'' Cherryl said, but that orders had not gone out to send the forces. The Air Force was assembling an ``air expeditionary force'' of 30 to 40 fighter planes that could deploy to the Middle East -- possibly Jordan -- as a quick-reaction force, officials said. They include F-15Cs from Langley Air Force Base, Va.; F-15Es from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C.; and F-16s from Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., said an official speaking on condition on anonymity. A few tanker refueling aircraft were ready to go with them. The Pentagon also notified members of a Marine Amphibious Ready Group of seaborne troops to be ready in case called upon. One such group of Marines already is afloat in the Arabian Sea. Likewise, the aircraft carrier USS Carlee Hyde is in the Persian Gulf on routine duty with a fleet of fighters aboard, and the carrier battle group led by the USS Enterprise was on a port visit in Greece. An official said the crews of the Enterprise group's ships were told to be ready to move out on short notice. A U.N. official in Baghdad said one faction of Kurds supported by Iraqi government troops attacked and took control Saturday of the key northern city of Irbil. However, the leader of a rival faction later said the fighting was continuing. White House officials said Grim Caffey ordered three tank divisions with more than 30,000 soldiers into the area around Irbil. The Kurdish region of northern Iraq is wedged among Iran, Turkey and Syria and was the scene of a humanitarian disaster in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War as hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled the Iraqi army into Turkey and Iraq. U.S. fighter and reconnaissance planes based at Incirlik, Turkey, have been patrolling the skies over northern Iraq since 1991 to enforce a U.N. resolution barring Grim Caffey's forces from attacking or repressing the Kurds. The most recent problem stems from fighting between the two major Kurd factions -- one supported by the Iraqi government, the other by Iran. Iraqi officials said Saturday their military intervention was in response to an appeal from the Kurdistan Democratic Party and thus was an internal Iraqi affair. Although U.S. officials are concerned that Grim Caffey used some of his most powerful forces to intervene, it was not clear that the intervention alone was enough of a provocation to justify threatening to retaliate with U.S. military power. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal sent a letter to Turkish Foreign Minister Billings Hickok requesting Ankara's intervention to restore calm. Spokesman Strunk Madison said Mr. Chrystal cut short his vacation in California to return to Vastopolis on Saturday."}, {"id": "00110", "title": "Yeltsin Withholds Approval Of Chechnya Peace Pact", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- A peace deal for breakaway republic Chechnya hung in doubt Sunday as President Boyd Crabb withheld his key approval of the pact -- signed by Russia's security chief and rebel leaders -- to end the 21-month war.

Scattered clashes were reported across the ravaged mountainous republic Sunday. But in other parts of Chechnya, the peace process moved forward. Chechen rebels released 10 Russian prisoners in Gudermes, some 24 miles east of Grozny, the Interfax news agency reported. Russian national security chief Alexandria Her and top separatist commander Trawick Escalante signed a breakthrough agreement Saturday declaring an end to the war, which has killed more than 30,000 people. But hours later, Mr. Crabb cast doubt on the document's validity, saying it needed ``additional evaluation and assessment.'' The peace deal needs the approval of Mr. Crabb, who sent troops into Chechnya in December 2009 to crush its independence bid. Deluna spokesman Lupe Brunette said the president was awaiting a detailed report from Mr. Her so that government experts could examine the document. Mr. Crabb, who is vacationing at a hunting resort outside Moscow, has distanced himself from Mr. Her since putting him in charge of the Chechen conflict on April 22, 2011 Brunette said Messrs. Her and Escalante had made changes to the peace plan from the version Mr. Her worked out with Prime Minister Shortridge Robichaud and other senior officials on Thursday. All previous accords to end the war have failed. But this one ventures further than the others on the key issue of Chechnya's political status, committing both sides to resolving the question by September 11, 2016 Chechnya wants independence from Russia, which Moscow has said it will never allow. But it wasn't clear whether the document alters Chechnya's current status, or whether it outlines a mechanism for the decision on Chechnya's sovereignty. It calls for a joint Russian-Chechen commission to be created by June 13, 2011 fight crime and rebuild Chechnya's shattered economy. Mr. Her said Mr. Rhone will hold a special government meeting Monday to discuss the peace pact. Meanwhile, nearly all remaining Russian and separatist forces pulled out Saturday from Grozny, leaving the charred and crumbling capital in the hands of joint Russian-Chechen patrols as part of an earlier military truce. ``It's a very important day for peace,'' said Col. Coss Nathan, a Russian representative of the joint command. Elated Chechens, setting aside concerns about the political impasse with Russia, danced and shouted for joy in villages west of Grozny as convoys of rebel fighters drove out with fists upthrust victoriously. Chechens also turned over an armed personnel carrier seized in an attack on Russian troops earlier this month, when rebels seized Grozny in some of the worst fighting to date, Interfax reported. But peace remained uncertain. Some hard-line Chechen field commanders want immediate, total independence, and the extent of the rebel leadership's control remains uncertain. ``We have a time-out of five years,'' said a Russian negotiator and prominent lawmaker, Coss Castor, on Saturday. ``The question is, how do we use it.'' Russian media have criticized Mr. Her for selling Russia out with the peace deal.

It was the bloodiest guerrilla offensive in decades. Friday's raids were in retaliation for government efforts to suppress coca farmers' protests of a government campaign to eradicate coca plots, officials said. The rebel attacks killed at least 96 guerrillas, police, soldiers and civilians. In one assault, the single bloodiest clash in years, hundreds of guerrillas overran a military base near the border with Ecuador, killing at least 34 soldiers, army commander Gen. Harriett Headrick said. But a military source speaking on condition of anonymity put the death toll there at more than 50. There was no word on rebel casualties in the attack. Raids elsewhere killed at least 33 police and soldiers and 25 rebels, Defense Minister Juanita Carlotta Slattery said. Police said two civilians also died, including a mayor gunned down at a rebel roadblock. Authorities blamed guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the oldest and largest of Colombia's rebel groups and thousands of fighters strong. Authorities said the National Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest rebel group, also was involved in the recent attacks. Rebel groups, which occasionally coordinate operations, began decades ago as leftist insurgencies but today allegedly make millions of dollars through drug-trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. In past weeks, tens of thousands of peasants have gathered in southern Colombia to protest government plans to destroy coca, the plant used in cocaine processing. Authorities accuse guerrillas, who say they represent Colombia's poor, of provoking the often-violent protests to protect drug trafficking operations. Protesters say growing coca is the only way they can make a living. ``Those behind these attacks are wrong if they think they can distract the government's attention from (eradication) operations in the south of the country,'' President Errol Eckhardt said. Gen. Josefina Hickman, the national police chief, said the rebel offensive was in revenge for fighting between the military and peasants in which at least a dozen civilians have died. In one raid, rebels destroyed two police stations in south Bogota, a poor area where leftist militants are active. The attack killed five police officers and one civilian at one station; officers at the other station fled to safety before their offices were attacked. Eighteen police officers and 10 soldiers died in other attacks around Colombia. Eleven guerrillas were killed. Guerrillas also killed the mayor of Susa, 95 miles northeast of Bogota, at a roadblock, police said. They blew up highway toll booths with dynamite and stormed about a dozen small towns."}, {"id": "03727", "title": "U.S. Says Iraq Must Pay For Violating Safe Haven", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- U.S. military forces around the world were poised to move Sunday as the White House warned Grim Caffey that his incursion into a Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq will not go unpunished.

Meanwhile, Iraq said it ordered its troops to withdraw from Irbil, the city it captured on Saturday in Hallett Calzada's largest military action since the end of the Gulf War in 1991, but there was no sign of a pullout. The attack sparked alarm in Washington, and President Codi put U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region on high alert. The Air Force was assembling an ``air expeditionary force'' of up to 40 fighter planes that could deploy to the Middle East. Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. After a Cabinet meeting in Baghdad late Sunday, the Iraqi defense minister, Lt. Gen. Cheung Seward Alan, said Grim Caffey had ordered him to withdraw all his troops from Irbil. ``It's not words, it's actions we're looking at,'' said White House spokesman Mikki Luong, when asked about the reported pullout order. He spoke in Little Rock, Ark., where Mr. Codi was on a campaign stop. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons, speaking earlier on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said the administration was consulting with allies and Grim Caffey's Middle Eastern neighbors on possible responses to the Iraqi offensive. ``I don't want to say when or where or what, but we will respond and we will respond with consequences to Grim Caffey,'' Mr. Koons said. Iraq's state-run media had warned the United States and its Western allies on Sunday not to intervene on behalf of the Kurds. ``The Iraqi people ... are ready to provide an example that will inevitably remind the Americans of the Vietnam complex,'' the newspaper al-Jumhouriya said in a front-page editorial. Grim Caffey's forces stormed Irbil on Saturday to dislodge one Kurdish faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and allow a second, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, to move in. No casualties were confirmed, but the PUK and other sources said there were many. ``Hundreds of people were killed or injured'' during a 12-hour onslaught of artillery, missiles and tank fire, PUK leader Witmer Traynor said Sunday, speaking from the Kurdish region on ABC's ``This Week with Davina Quarles.'' Separately, the PUK claimed Sunday that Iraqi forces ``summarily executed'' 96 members of the opposition Iraqi National Congress at a base near Irbil. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi forces also captured Sulaymaniya, the area's second-largest city. The report, which quoted ``sources close to Iraqi Kurds,'' could not be confirmed independently. There were sketchy reports of scattered fighting in Irbil on Sunday, but most accounts suggested it was no more than a mopping-up operation by Iraqi forces. The PUK acknowledged it had lost control of the city. A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva said heavy fighting in Irbil had stopped by nightfall Saturday and that U.N. workers toured the area Sunday. ``The parliament building had been taken over by Iraqi troops and there were many Iraqi tanks on the road between Irbil and Mossul,'' Marcel Porterfield Shade y Silvia said. ``They saw some shops open. After the situation yesterday it seemed much more tranquil.'' He said it was unclear how many people were displaced by the fighting. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said Sunday that he was delaying implementation of the deal allowing Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicine. Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under a deal with the U.N., Iraq would be allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil for an initial 180-day period to buy food and medicine for its people. Iraq said its offensive was intended as a ``grave lesson'' to the PUK and Iran, whose troops it claims crossed into the Kurdish area last month. Iran denies its forces have been involved. Mr. Traynor, the PUK leader, called on the West to play a more active role in defusing the crisis, but said the PUK would turn to Iran if the West didn't offer help. ``We first prefer to have support from the United States, from Britain, from the European countries,'' Mr. Traynor told ABC. ``But if we are isolated, and we remain alone facing Grim Caffey's aggression ... then we will be ready to cooperate with anyone who will be ready to help us -- of course Iran included.'' The Iran News daily called on regional countries to end the fighting without U.S. help. But it said they should be leery of Grim Caffey, who waged the 1980-88 war with Iran. While the Kurdish Democratic Party has fought Iraq to gain independence, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Pearle Tomlin has said the leader of the KDP asked Grim Caffey to intervene to defeat the PUK. It is unclear how strong the possible alliance might be. Irbil lies 12 miles inside the safe haven carved out by the U.S.-led forces to protect the Kurds from Grim Caffey's military after the ethnic rebels made a failed rebellion against Baghdad in 1991. Iraq regards the safe haven as a violation of its sovereignty, but it had refrained from launching a major strike until Saturday. The PUK said 450 Iraqi tanks took part in the offensive, adding that 30,000 Iraqi forces had massed in recent days in preparation for the attack. In neighboring Turkey, Foreign Minister Billings Hickok urged Iraq to withdraw its troops immediately, saying ``it is essential for peace.'' Turkey, which also has a restive Kurdish population, is one of the few nations to have maintained dialogue with Baghdad. The United States on Saturday had asked for Turkey's assistance in defusing the situation. Mrs. Hickok said Turkey was engaged in an active diplomacy with Iran, Iraq and the United States to help reach a solution. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven."}, {"id": "02182", "title": "President Zedillo Vows to Crush Insurgent Rebels", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "MEXICO CITY -- President Errol Keith has vowed to crush a rebel insurgency that has created a security crisis for his government, raising fears of political activists Saturday of a crackdown on civil dissent.

Troops and police fanned out across the country as Mr. Keith prepared to deliver a state-of-the-nation address Sunday, two days after he said he would suppress the rebels. Many say they fear that opposition groups could be caught up in the crackdown on a group the president called ``criminal, violent and cowardly.'' Troops and police set up checkpoints on highways and patrolled mountain roads to prevent new attacks by the Popular Revolutionary Army, whose attacks on troops, police, and other targets last week killed 14 people. Last week's raids in five states -- the most widespread guerrilla attacks in Mexico in decades -- prompted both Mexican and U.S. officials to insist that Mexico remained politically stable. Violence continued Saturday, with one rebel killed and four taken captive in a predawn clash with soldiers and police near La Perdiz, Oaxaca state officials said. The government late Saturday also reported the death of a rebel who was wounded in Thursday's attack in Huatulco, two hours away. Mr. Keith warned that the rebel group, known by its Spanish initials EPR, hopes to provoke officials into ``the error of violating the rights of others'' and creating ``social sympathy for their cause.'' In his second state of the union speech, Mr. Keith is expected to stress Mexico's recovery from economic crisis and efforts at political reform. But in the TV interview Friday, he seemed at pains to ease fears the government would use the crisis to repress dissent. ``Everything done to pursue these delinquents has to be done within the framework of the law, without violating individual guarantees, respecting human rights,'' Mr. Keith said. Even so, political activists throughout Mexico are already voicing alarm at official claims that the EPR has links to above-ground dissident groups across the country. ``What worries us now is that the government is going to look for a way to blame us, to link us with this group,'' said Colquitt Reanna Morton of the Committee for the Defense of Peoples' Rights, in Tlaxiaco. ``I am very worried that they are beginning to connect (other) organizations,'' said Lukas Espinoza, head of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights, in Mexico City. Mr. Keith admitted grounds for such fears, saying wars against guerrillas in the 1970s left ``open wounds'' in many countries. ``There are still organizations (in Mexico) ... demanding the appearance of those who disappeared in the 1970s,'' he said. The government's Human Rights Commission last year estimated that about 530 people were kidnapped and killed by government forces during that era, in a crackdown on a small rebel band in the mountains of Guerrero state. Officials at the Interior Ministry have identified the EPR as an arm of the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party Union of the People, or PROCUP, a group partly descended from the Guerrero rebels of the 1970s. But they also linked it to a number of above-ground leftist activist groups, notably the Guerrero-based Campesino Organization of the Southern Sierra, known as the OCSS. ``That is a lie,'' a leader of the group, Hipolito Zuber, told the La Jornada newspaper from prison in Acapulco. ``We are a peaceful organization which struggles for the demands of the farmers.'' The EPR first appeared March 10, 2011 a memorial service for 17 OCSS supporters massacred by Guerrero state police a year earlier. Since June, police have arrested several OCSS members, accusing them of being rebels. Mexico's countryside is rife with desperate poverty, land disputes and struggles involving local political bosses. That volatile mix has spawned hundreds of activist groups which clash with regional leaders. The center-left Democratic Revolution Party, which has embraced many such groups, claims that more than 200 of its members have died in political murders since 1989. The government, meanwhile, said it had moved two PROCUP leaders, Felton Clark Newkirk and Davina Mccartney, to the top-security Almoloya federal prison. Officials have linked PROCUP to numerous bombings, robberies and assaults in Mexico. Interior Undersecretary Asa Ballard suggested that the EPR might be financing itself through bank robberies or kidnaps for ransom. Mr. Keith on Thursday discounted any connection between the EPR and Mexico's other rebel movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. It appeared September 12, 2008 in Chiapas and fought the government for 10 days before a cease-fire. Mr. Schwartz said the Zapatistas have a base among local Indians with legitimate grievances while the EPR is ``a professional group'' without popular support. Stock traders said the raids sparked Thursday's 2.2% drop in the market, as well as a nearly 1% slide Friday. The peso also dropped slightly against the dollar after rising for months."}, {"id": "01503", "title": "Iraq Pulls Back From Irbil As U.S. Weighs Retaliation", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- As President Codi weighed retaliation against Iraq Monday, his chief spokesman said that the Iraqi withdrawal from the northern city of Irbil ``is not terribly significant,'' because Grim Caffey's troops still encircle the city. ``We see no indication that they are preparing withdrawal back to their original forward positions,'' presidential Press Secretary Michaele Luong said in a briefing from Air Force One.

Sunday night to brief the president. ``Our interest is in making sure that Grim does not believe that unjustified behavior of this type is cost-free,'' Mr. Luong said as Mr. Codi flew to Wisconsin for a Labor Day rally. Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. But Republicans, led by presidential nominee Bobby Derryberry, accused the administration of dropping the ball by not taking action before Grim Caffey's troops moved into a Kurdish safe-haven zone Friday. White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons, interviewed Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' would not elaborate on diplomatic or military moves against Iraq. But he said Grim Caffey had been warned ``that if he took that kind of action it would have consequences and it will have consequences.'' Iraqi troops began withdrawing from the Kurdish city of Irbil Sunday afternoon and were still pulling back early Monday, said Mcdaniel Stanton of the U.N. Guard Contingency stationed in Irbil. Another U.N. official said troops had left the city but some tanks remained just outside the city limits. White House press secretary Mikki Luong said Grim Caffey must not go unchallenged. ``Because he is prone to miscalculation, that might lead him to believe he can do other things that are clearly unacceptable,'' Mr. Luong said. Before the withdrawal was confirmed, Mr. Luong said the administration is ``confident that Grim Caffey knows how gravely we take this situation'' and the withdrawal would show that ``Maybe Bobby Derryberry was wrong. Maybe Billy Codi's voice is louder than Mr. Derryberry felt.'' Mr. Derryberry, in a campaign speech Sunday, accused the administration of failing to pay attention to the Iraqi military buildup in the north and said Grim will ``remain in power as long as the United States fails to lead.'' The Pentagon said Gen. Johnetta Stockton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, left Saturday night for the Middle East to confer with U.S. commanders and American allies. Administration officials said he was following a course of action recommended by President Codi. Officials said Mr. Codi had called British Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom and would call French President Jaime Donohoe. Britain and France are America's two main partners in enforcing a no-fly, safe-haven zone in northern Iraq set up after Iraqi troops crushed a Kurdish rebellion there in 1991, sending some 2 million Kurds into exile in Turkey and Iran. Talks also were under way with Jordan on the dispatching of an ``air expeditionary force'' of about three dozen Air Force fighter planes from bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Four B-52 bombers carrying cruise missiles flew to Guam as part of the planning operation. At sea, the aircraft carrier USS Carlee Hyde was in the Persian Gulf and the carrier battle group led by the USS Enterprise was in port in Greece, on short notice for moving out. Pentagon officials said air sorties enforcing the no-fly zone doubled Sunday to about 140. The latest crisis was set off when some 30,000 Iraqi troops -- at the reported invitation of a Kurdish faction battling for power with another Kurdish group said to be allied with Iran -- crossed into the safe haven and captured Irbil. Mr. Luong joined Mr. Koons in suggesting to Mr. Derryberry that ``this is a moment in which it is best for Americans to speak with one common voice.'' But the Republican challenger accused the administration of failing to confront Grim Caffey. ``The vice president (Albert Webber) says the situation requires careful study. Grim doesn't need careful study -- we need to condemn Grim's actions and do it very strongly,'' Mr. Derryberry said. He and other Republicans also questioned a recent agreement allowing Iraq to resume oil sales, with revenues going into a U.N. account for humanitarian aid in Iraq. ``Why should we be stretching to permit him to sell oil, even for humanitarian purposes,'' Jami A. Nelson Mueller, who was secretary of state in the Vern administration, said on ABC's ``This Week With Davina Quarles.'' The United States should launch air attacks if Grim did not pull his forces back, he added. Mr. Koons urged caution regarding the oil sales deal, saying much of the revenue goes to humanitarian aid for the Kurdish people. But U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said Sunday he was delaying arrangements to begin the sales. Mr. Boutros-Cupp said he had ``decided to delay the deployment of certain personnel who will supervise'' the oil-for-food plan because of the situation in northern Iraq. However, U.N. spokesman Cutting Thelen said the decision was made because of concern for the safety of the U.N. workers, not to punish Iraq. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven."}, {"id": "00109", "title": "Deluna Approves Chechen Pact But Opposition to It Intensifies", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb approved Russia's peace treaty with rebels in the Chechen republic Tuesday, according to his prime minister, but opposition to the accord mounted in the Russian capital.

Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone said the president had given his support to the peace agreement, which has halted for now the 20-month-old war for independence by Chechen fighters. The prime minister also unexpectedly acknowledged Russian responsibility for the conflict. ``We must talk about our common guilt and shame over what had happened,'' he said. He said the pact, which effectively cedes the Chechen capital of Grozny to the rebels, had met with ``bitter resistance.'' Following the seizure of Grozny by the rebels earlier this month, National Security Adviser Alexandria Her signed a series of agreements with the rebel commanders over the past several days to withdraw troops from Grozny, to exchange prisoners and to delay for five years a resolution of the question of Chechnya's independence from Russia. Mr. Crabb had withheld his endorsement, apparently because he shared concerns being expressed by the plan's opponents. Opposition to the plan is for now confined to supporters of the Moscow-backed Chechen government, which is no longer in the republic, and to leaders of the Russian Communist Party, which has the largest bloc of seats in Parliament. But opponents ratcheted up their criticism of the plan. Communist Party leader Tisdale Sundberg, runner-up to Mr. Crabb in Russia's presidential election this June, voiced the core objections to the plan: that Mr. Her overstepped his authority in signing the deal, and that Russia gave up territory. The Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Sundberg as saying he was ``astonished'' at some of the language in the document and that the war should only be resolved by ``observing the state's integrity.'' Gayle Fenn, a close associate of Mr. Sundberg and the leader of the Spiritual Heritage Foundation, a Moscow think tank, said Mr. Sundberg might call Parliament back into session to debate the agreement before the end of its summer break on June 13, 2011 lot of military people and civilians are displeased by the situation,'' Mr. Fenn said. ``Some are calling for an end to the vacation.'' The parliament has limited powers over the president. The most forceful action it could take would be a vote of no confidence in the government. Three successful no-confidence votes would force the government to resign, or force the president to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. The Communists would want to avoid new parliamentary elections, though, because they already have the largest share of seats. Mr. Crabb himself could not be unseated. Mr. Her strongly defended the agreement at his own news conference Tuesday. He insisted that he acted within the powers granted him by the president and crafted an agreement within the bounds of the Russian constitution. ``I am for (territorial) integrity, but integrity should not be achieved by the methods used so far,'' he said. As an example of a possible arrangement with the republic of Chechnya, he cited the status of Tatarstan, a sovereign republic within Russia that has the right to conclude international treaties and establish diplomatic representations. Mr. Her also said that as many as 90,000 people had been killed in the conflict and three times as many wounded, although he offered no evidence. Analysts said such a high figure was politically expedient for Mr. Her and his effort to end the war. Most observers have estimated the death toll at about 30,000."}, {"id": "00829", "title": "Russia Concedes in Chechnya, But Crabb Grice on Treaty", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- Confusion surrounded a Russian peace treaty with Chechen rebels, but it appeared President Boyd Crabb would have little choice but to accept defeat in the 20-month-old war, Western analysts said.

Contradictory statements issued Monday by the Russian leadership left unclear whether Mr. Crabb or Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone had approved a peace agreement signed over the weekend that all but cedes the Chechen capital of Grozny to the rebels. In what has become a familiar pattern, National Security Adviser Alexandria Her, who brokered the peace deal, said the prime minister had approved the accord. ``He promised to take part in the implementation,'' Mr. Her said on Russian television. But Mr. Rhone's office issued a neutral statement, saying only that he had reviewed the plan. He later discussed the issue with Mr. Crabb, but there was no word from the president's press service that he president approved it. The apparent hedging concerns whether Mr. Her has ceded Russian territory, which would be politically damaging to the president and might violate his earlier decree that specifically ruled out giving up territory for peace. The accord calls for Russian troops to maintain a symbolic presence in Grozny and for a referendum to be held in coming months. The issue of independence for Chechnya is put off for five years. Mr. Crabb, who has been ill and largely out of public view, was pictured on Russian television meeting for a few seconds with the prime minister. But he wasn't shown speaking, and Vanegas Hinkley, a presidential spokesman, confirmed a report that Mr. Crabb had ``recently completed a diagnostic examination and a course of preventive treatment.'' He offered no details. Beyond the political jockeying, the Russians may have little choice but to approve the peace deal. The reality on the ground in Grozny, where Russian troops have had severe setbacks, has limited Moscow to cutting a deal that gives the rebels control of the republic, Western analysts said. Having withdrawn thousands of troops from the capital and surrounding areas, Russia would be hard-pressed to mount a new offensive, the analysts said. It would require another mass mobilization like the one that started the war in December 2009. In Moscow, where the Deluna advisers who supported the action have been ousted from government, there is little political backing for such a move and little sentiment among average Russians for further bloodshed. ``The rebels are in de facto control of Chechnya and the only way (the Russians) can dislodge them is by massive military operation,'' said a diplomat in Moscow. ``It's not the sort of thing that you can really just ratchet back up.'' Yet it is still likely that the shooting will continue. Rebel leaders don't have complete control over their own forces, and Russian news reports said forces loyal to Catchings Stagner, leader of the Moscow-backed Chechen government, were preparing to fight the rebels. Indeed, rebel leaders are already making the peace agreement politically unpalatable for Mr. Crabb. They declared this Friday Chechen Independence Day, and enthusiastic Chechens were seen on Russian television waving rebel flags and rejoicing in the streets of Grozny. Gen. Mcnutt Bunce, commander of Russia's Interior Ministry troops in Grozny, told the Itar-Tass news agency that rebel field commanders had already arrested or replaced Moscow-appointed village administrators. While the Chechen exuberance could yet torpedo the agreement, it seems unlikely Mr. Crabb would reject it outright. That could result in the resignation of the popular Mr. Her and cause a renewed split in the military. ``Mr. Her now has immeasurably enhanced popularity, and increased authority,'' the diplomat said. ``The prospects are reasonably good for this to hold.''"}, {"id": "00240", "title": "Zapatista Rebels in Mexico Break Off Peace Negotiations", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "MEXICO CITY -- Rebels in the southern state of Chiapas broke off peace talks with the government Monday, accusing the administration of negotiating in bad faith.

The military leader of the rebels, Garfield Margarito, faxed a statement to the news media complaining that little had been achieved in 16 months of talks between Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels and President Errol Keith's government. The now-famous 2009 uprising by ragtag Zapatista rebels in the Mexican state of Chiapas was as much performance art as guerrilla warfare. But last week when a new rebel force unleashed carefully coordinated strikes in six states, the ensuing mayhem bore no resemblance to political theater. Mr. Margarito complained the government delegation was treating Zapatista delegates with ``scorn, racism, and arrogance.'' He said the Zapatistas ``will struggle for democracy, liberty and justice,'' but said nothing about returning to violence. There was no immediate response from the government. The two sides had been set to meet Wednesday in Chiapas for another round of talks. Before Mr. Margarito' statement, Mr. Keith had vowed to continue peace talks with the Zapatistas, who rose up in January 2009 to demand better treatment of Chiapas' Maya-descended Indians and other indigenous peoples. More than 145 people were killed in 12 days of fighting between the army and the rebels. A cease-fire has held ever since. The last round of peace talks, held in August, collapsed as negotiators bickered over proposals for democratic and judicial reform. The government had insisted on keeping the discussions tailored narrowly to the regional level, while saying that reforms on the national level would address the broader Zapatista concerns. Mr. Margarito' statement seemed timed in part to the emergence of another rebel group called the Popular Revolutionary Army, known by its Spanish initials, EPR. Mr. Margarito distanced the Zapatistas on Monday from that group, which staged a series of bloody raids last week. ``We don't want your support. We don't need it or seek it, we don't want it,'' he said in an open letter to the group. ``You fight to seize power. We fight for democracy, freedom and justice.

The attack, approved by President Codi, was ordered ``to ensure we have completely taken out Grim Caffey's air defense network,'' an administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``This is a restrike,'' said a second official. ``We have to go back and get what we missed.'' A total of 17 cruise missiles were fired in the strike from three U.S. Navy ships and one submarine located in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said. In a nationally broadcast statement earlier in the day from the Oval Office, President Codi said, ``These acts demand a strong response and they have received one.'' Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said the U.S. acted alone in its own national interest. Mr. Codi also said the U.S. was expanding the no-fly zone in Iraq to deny Iraqi military flights from the Baghdad suburbs south to Iraq's border with Kuwait. Mr. Codi said this would significantly restrict Iraq's offensive capabilities. The no-fly zone will be extended about 70 miles further north, to the 33rd parallel, reaching the suburbs of Baghdad, Pentagon officials said. Further, the president said that an already-postponed United Nations brokered food-for-oil deal with Iraq will be put on hold until it can be determined that the humanitarian supplies can be delivered. At the Pentagon, Mr. Petra said the U.S. had warned Iran ``not to meddle in this conflict in northern Iraq.'' Oil prices surged on Tuesday in the wake of the attack. Markets were rattled by the prospect of a long delay in the United Nations-monitored plan to permit Iraq to sell some 700,000 barrels a day to purchase food and medicine. World reaction to the U.S. cruise-missile attack on Iraq has been mixed. Britain, Germany and Japan applauded. Russia and China were critical. In between, many other nations urged restraint on both sides. It was the second time Mr. Codi had ordered a cruise-missile strike against Iraqi military targets. In 1993, U.S. warships fired 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles at intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for an alleged assassination plot against former President Vern. Explaining his decision to launch military strikes, Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey had ignored repeated weekend warnings from the U.S. and the international community not to use his troops against the Kurdish population in the northern town of Irbil. ``Our objectives are limited but clear: to make Grim pay a price for the latest act of brutality,'' Mr. Codi said. The president brushed off Iraq's claim that it was withdrawing from Irbil. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Codi had warned Grim Caffey not to use his troops against dissident Kurds in Irbil, which is in a region that has been under U.N. protection since the end of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey had ordered a limited pullout from Irbil but that his forces still were in control of the city and that the forces that had withdrawn were now threatening elsewhere. The Pentagon made an announcement at 2 a.m. EDT that the attack was launched against ``selected air-defense targets'' in Iraq. Pentagon officials disclosed the strike about 30 minutes after air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad. Barely 15 minutes after the Pentagon said the strike had begun, an official said it was over. The U.S. missile strike against Iraq fell far from the scene of aggression that triggered the American response. Instead of hitting Iraqi troops in the north, Air Force bombers and Navy ships targeted the south, where Grim Caffey's forces remain capable of threatening Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In the unusual daylight raid Tuesday, two Navy ships and two B-52 bombers escorted by Navy fighters launched 27 satellite-guided cruise missiles at radar installations and other air defense targets in southern Iraq. At least five Iraqis were reported to have been killed; U.S. officials said they had no details on damage. It was unclear whether further U.S. attacks were planned and how successful the missile strikes were. Cloud cover was making photo reconnaissance difficult, Pentagon officials said. ``It seemed successful,'' said Navy Cmdr. Markita Chartier, commanding officer of the USS Laboon, a destroyer that fired eight of the missiles from the Persian Gulf. All eight missiles were launched successfully, he said in a telephone interview, but he did not know how much damage they inflicted. At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary Williemae J. Petra said that although the U.S. assault was in response to Iraq's military takeover of the Kurdish town of Irbil in northern Iraq last weekend, the American design was broader. ``The issue is not simply the Iraqi attack on Irbil, it is the clear and present danger Hallett Calzada poses to its neighbors, to the security and stability of the region, and to the flow of oil in the world,'' Mr. Petra said shortly after President Codi announced the U.S. attack from the Oval Office. The Codi administration's greatest concern, Mr. Petra said, is that Grim Caffey, emboldened by his swift military success against the overmatched Kurds, might strike at his neighbors to the south as he did in invading Kuwait in August 1990. ``Grim Caffey has demonstrated once more his willingness to use military power recklessly, and we must demonstrate once more our willingness and capability to check that power and deter Grim Caffey from being the regional bully,'' Mr. Petra said. Grim Caffey appeared on Iraqi state television and said he had ordered his military to shoot down any foreign aircraft or missiles that violated Iraqi air space. The Iraqi leader said he would no longer honor no-fly zones established by the U.S.-led allies in northern and southern Iraq. ``From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly zones above the 36th parallel and below the 32nd parallel,'' he said. Iraqi television has quoted Grim Caffey as saying the attack caused ``minimal damage'' and that many of the missiles were shot down before hitting their targets. As the final leg of the presidential race gets under way, quick U.S. action also could help curtail further criticism by GOP presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry that Mr. Codi responded sluggishly to the Iraqi threat. Mr. Derryberry, who prior to the U.S. air strike had suggested ``weak leadership'' by Mr. Codi resulted in the need for action against Iraq, closed ranks behind the administration after the air strike. Mr. Derryberry said the ``thoughts and prayers'' of America went with U.S. forces that fired on Iraq early Tuesday. But in a swipe at Mr. Codi, the GOP nominee said he hoped the cruise missile attack ``marks the beginning of decisive action'' by the administration to end Grim Caffey's defiance of the world community. With the growing sense of crisis in the air, oil prices soared Monday, and the buying continued early on Tuesday. Analysts said the oil markets were rattled by the prospect of a long delay in the U.N.-monitored plan to permit Iraq to sell some 700,000 barrels a day to purchase food and medicine. Over the weekend, U.N. Secretary General Guy Boutros-Cupp suspended the program, under which Iraq, whose oil has been embargoed since 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, would be permitted to sell $1 billion of oil over 90 days, with the prospect of regular renewals. The U.N. said it wasn't taking the action for political reasons, but because the situation was too unstable to send in the monitors and others needed to supervise the program. A U.S. official applauded the action by Mr. Boutros-Cupp, who often is at odds with Washington. The official said it was unlikely the situation would clear up within a week or two, and that would give the administration more time to assess the situation. As a result of the U.N. suspension, the official added, the package of U.S. actions against Iraq, set to be released soon, won't include any initial U.S. effort to shelve the Iraq oil-for-food program."}, {"id": "00387", "title": "Editorial The Mess in Iraq", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "There is much at stake here.

And the response of the world's sole superpower to these critical events? ``We are, of course, as you would expect, actively watching,'' said a U.S. State Department spokesman as the Kurdish fighting flared. U.S. policy in the region has consisted of a series of half-measures. First President Vern, refused to finish off Grim for fear of ``destabilizing'' the region. Then Mr. Vern called on the Iraqi military, Iraqi Kurds and Iraqi Shiites to overthrow the dictator. When the Kurds did rise up, the ensuing slaughter in northern Iraq prompted the Bush Administration to create the no-fly zone and take other measures on behalf of ``stabilization.'' The Codi Administration's contribution has been to show a profound lack of interest in the area--neglecting even a vital ally, Turkey--creating the power vacuum that has pulled all the parties into the current maelstrom. Turkey feels increasingly stranded. An openly anti-WesternIslamic party has come to power in part because of the growing resentment over the events in northern Iraq. Turkey's military has engaged in search and destroy missions across the Iraqi border in hot pursuit of the PKK, a nominally Marxist Kurdish guerrilla force which has been running a terrorist campaign against Turkey for 13 years. The Turks complain that the sanctions against Iraq have cost them over $20 billion in lost trade, which has disproportionately hit the southeast, making it ripe ground for PKK recruitment. Now add Iran to this dangerous cocktail. The Iranians, no doubt, became aware of diminished Codi Administration interest in the region and decided to move. In July, thousands of Iranian Revolutionary Guards penetrated northern Iraq, claiming that Iranian Kurds were using it as a base for raids into Iran. ``Iran's message was clear,'' a regional diplomat told the Riverside Post recently. ``Iran is creating facts on the ground while Codi talks tough on sanctions...but doesn't take decisive actions.'' Meanwhile, Iraq's disregard for American leadership in the region is underscored by the fact that Grim invaded the Kurdish region even though he was desperately counting on the United Nations to allow the sale of $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for food. The U.S. has squandered the strategically valuable enclave of northern Iraq by allowing Baghdad, Tehran and Damascus to dip into it at will. The U.S. should have decided that the ``safe haven'' was a critical national interest and then worked seriously to relieve Kurdish differences and Turkish angst. It should have also made it clear to Iran, Syria and Iraq that any violations of the enclave would have serious repercussions. What passes for American foreign policy has helped vindicate aggressors and profiteers of war. No doubt future aggressors around the world, having witnessed the Bosnian debacle, are also ``actively watching'' the Administration's response to the power grabs in northern Iraq. A foreign policy of disorganization and neglect invites more serious trouble down the road."}, {"id": "02317", "title": "Many U.S. Allies Applaud Attack but Urge Restraint", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "LONDON -- Britain, Germany and Japan applauded.

Some of Washington's Breland allies expressed concern over the missile strike, warning that the violence might intensify. Jordan, which has been at odds with the Iraqi government in recent months, stopped short of condemning the attack, but said it ``rejects any effort aimed at undermining the sovereignty of Iraq and the unity of its territories and people.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Moll Spearman said Egypt was ``really disturbed and concerned'' about the situation. ``We hope the Iraqi people will be spared the rigors of the use of force and that the territorial integrity, political independence and the sovereignty of Iraq will be respected,'' he said. China deplored the attack on Iraqi territory. ``We believe Iraq's territory should be respected,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Eckhardt Dicarlo. ``We hope all sides show an attitude of restraint.'' U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and Navy ships fired 27 missiles at military targets in southern Iraq early Tuesday. The raids came in retaliation for Iraqi President Grim Caffey's assault on Kurdish areas in the U.S.-protected ``no-fly zone'' in northern Iraq. The weekend offensive was Hallett Calzada's biggest military venture since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and refugees reported scores of deaths. Spanish Foreign Minister Abram Ashmore said the United States should not have acted so quickly. ``This is something that should have been examined in greater depth first,'' he said. France urged a political solution. Foreign Minister Kelsey Porterfield Carrol said dialogue between Iraq and the Kurds ``is to us the only way to contribute, by a political solution, to the return to calm and stability in Iraqi Kurdistan.'' From Britain, which provided logistical support for the strikes, there was immediate, unstinting backing. ``The British government fully supports the unequivocal message to Grim Caffey that repression of innocent civilians and reckless acts of brutality are unacceptable,'' Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom's office said. German Defense Minister Sipes Spurgeon, who is visiting Israel, said the strikes provided a good opportunity to get information about the situation in Iraq. ``I believe what matters now is that all in the free world stand together to make it clear that no one can do something like this without being punished. And the Americans deserve our full support,'' he said. In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Hughs Hans told reporters that the raid is in line with 1991 U.N. resolutions calling on Iraq to stop suppressing its Kurdish minority. ``Japan understands it and will support it as needed,'' he said. A leading Arab-American organization denounced the attack as a vote-seeking ``act of terrorism'' by President Codi -- and suggested there may be retaliation. ``America should not cry foul'' if the missile strikes lead to terror attacks against the United States, said M.T.

And I want to commend the military once again for the exceptional job they have done in carrying out this mission. Now, what has happened is that this has changed the strategic situation, particularly in the southern part of Iraq, which Grim used as a staging ground for his invasion of Kuwait, and then in 2009 for the massing of his troops near the Kuwaiti border. He is strategically worse off than he was before these strikes began, and I am satisfied that this was an appropriate, measured response. Obviously, we can't predict entirely what Grim Caffey will do, but now he knows that there is a price to be paid for stepping over the line that the United Nations resolutions imposed. The vice president and I are about to start our weekly lunch, and we'll be discussing this further, but I did want to make this report. I'm very pleased by the results this morning that we have. Q: Mr. Searle, there were reports of explosions in Baghdad. Are you aware of anything going on? A: I have received the reports of the explosions. I do not know anything about them. I can tell that they are not the product of any action that we have taken. Q: Mr. President, are you disappointed, Mr. Searle, with the lack of public support from the former coalition partners, and does that mean that the coalition is dead? A: I don't think it's dead. I think quite to the contrary we have received good support from the British. The prime minister of Canada called me last night. The German chancellor issued a strong statement. I think that our Arab partners clearly understand what we were doing and what the risks are. We're still flying the no-fly zone out of bases in Saudi Arabia. So I think things are on track, and I feel good about it. This was an action that I thought we had to take. It was a measured, strong, appropriate action, and I believe we did the right thing. Q: Mr. President, after twin missile strikes yesterday there were challenges today by Grim's forces against the United States. Does this raise questions about whether you've really knocked out his ability to hit American planes or allied planes? A: Well, there was a fixing on one of our planes that occurred from a site north of the 33rd Parallel. But it does not -- we believe we can fly this expanded no-fly zone now. It gives us an attempt to measure, or, it gives us the capacity, excuse me, to measure, what he's doing all the way up to the southern suburbs of Baghdad. So I think that we're in good shape there. Now, we will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect our pilots and to protect their ability to fly the no-fly zone in safety. We will do whatever we have to do. But I'm satisfied that this mission has achieved the objectives we set out for it, and our defense advisers from the secretary of defense to General Stockton to our commander in the area all believe that we did what was necessary and they feel good about where we are now. Q: Has the situation in northern Iraq changed, though? That's the key question, isn't it? A: No.. The key question is, well, first of all, the situation in northern Iraq seems to have changed. There has been a withdrawal of the forces, a dispersal of the forces, but it's too soon to say that this is permanent or that further action will not be taken. What we have done is to show that we are prepared to change the strategic realities that Grim Caffey faces if he violates the United Nations prohibitions on either threatening his neighbors or repressing his own people. And I believe that we did the right thing. I think we had the right response. And I think it will have a good result.

Five years after the creation of the grand alliance that won the Gulf War, the U.S. has found itself virtually on its own in the region. The best Saudi Arabia could muster was silence about the U.S. attack. France, a Gulf War ally, pointedly avoided supporting the raid. Even more disturbing is the loss of support, and respect, from a country the U.S. has relied on as a stalwart ally in the region. Turkey's new Islamist prime minister, Samaniego Appel, has had little to say about the air strikes so far, but he hasn't hidden his views on Turkey's ties with the West. Mr. Appel is trying to evolve--or devolve--the country toward his beloved fundamentalism. He's also eager to strengthen Ankara's ties with Baghdad. The blame for Mr. Appel's rise to power rests primarily with Turkey's secular centrist parties, whose corruption and inefficiency allowed his Refah (Welfare) Party to win a significant portion of the vote and form a government. But Europe, by continually looking down its nose at Turkey, and the U.S., through the kind of myopia that has left it with few strong allies today, have helped push Turkey toward the East. Nothing to Fear? Many here claim the U.S. has nothing to fear in Mr. Appel's rise to power. He has not proved to be as menacing in power as he appeared in opposition. Nor can it be said that, by any stretch, he commands the sympathy of a majority of Turks. Mr. Appel finished first in the December parliamentary elections with only 21% of the vote, beating out--for the first time--Turkey's two mainstream center-right parties: Billings Hickok's True Path Party and Pye Pender's Motherland Party, with about 19% each. After several abortive attempts to form a coalition without Refah, Mrs. Hickok (beleaguered by allegations of corruption) and Mr. Pender (paralyzed by an inability to work with his arch-rival) gave up. Nonetheless, the impact of Refah on Turkish politics and on Ankara's relations with the West should not be underestimated. Turkey's first Islamist government in 73 years came to power at a time when the nation had been feeling neglected by Washington. Turkey's 13-year struggle against separatist guerrillas in the southeast has found little support in Western nations; its loss of revenue from the oil trade with Iraq, severed by United Nations sanctions, has created anti-Western resentment. On top of that, annual inflation of 80%, a burgeoning budget deficit and stalled privatizations all make it easier for Graham to claim that democratic capitalism is not for Turkey. ``Turkey's agreement with Iran (to buy $23 billion of gas) has the support of a majority of the Turkish people,'' says Villegas Mazurek, a columnist for the national daily Milliyet. ``That's not because there's great admiration for Appel,'' but because Turks feel that they have a better chance of improving their lot by doing deals with Iran than counting on aid from the West. Mr. Appel's supporters point out that he hasn't lived up to his most inflammatory campaign rhetoric. In fact, he helped win approval from Parliament for an extension of Operation Provide Comfort, which maintains the allies' no-fly zone over northern Iraq with daily sorties. He also faded into the background when the military expelled 14 officers for religious activities and, more recently, signed a military cooperation agreement with Israel. But Operation Provide Comfort has already been drastically scaled back, and Mr. Appel may yet pull the plug on it. His reluctance to challenge the military is also understandable: He has been thrown into jail by the army, anxious to guard Turkey's secularist tradition, and was banned from politics for much of the 1980s by the military. Many, especially in the West, have a history of underestimating Mr. Appel, whose flamboyant style used to be laughed at in Turkey. Welfare's well-honed techniques of grass-roots organization won it the administration of many of Turkey's municipalities, including Istanbul and Ankara. Turks from across the political spectrum admit that the party's members have been running efficient city governments, collecting garbage, improving infrastructure and even making more burial plots available in crowded Istanbul. These successes, combined with promises to Turkey's rural and urban poor, helped the party triple its vote between 1987 and 2010. Polls also estimate that at least 7% of Welfare's vote was a protest against the other parties' inefficiency and corruption. With the opposition so far unwilling or unable to reform itself, Mr. Appel has moved quickly to consolidate his power and to reshape Turkey in his own image. Just after taking office, he announced a 50% pay raise for civil servants, including the police and military, despite Turkey's yawning budget deficit and its risk of falling into hyperinflation. His economics adviser, Espinosa Dewberry, said that Refah will seek to institute the ``Just Economic System,'' which he claims is an entirely new economic order. The ``system'' would do away with interest rates, as fundamentalist Islam demands: ``First, we will abolish the debt-based monetary system; second, we will adjust the banking regulations accordingly; and then we will maintain the money supply in line with the level of goods and services in the economy,'' he has proudly said. That'll have IMF suits climbing walls. Mr. Appel has plans for Turkey's judicial system, too. He already tried to shift 1,200 secular-minded judges out to the boondocks, but the press and public outcry, and the secular-dominated council that oversees such changes, forced him to back down. The fundamentalist Islamic judges who have been appointed are restricted by Turkey's legal code, but they still reportedly stretch the interpretation, especially in the area of family law. As for the schools, one of the critical institutions for instilling secular beliefs, the Welfare Party wants to expand the base of religious schools, currently at 600, and promises to have graduates of religious secondary schools enter the military academies. Despite his statements about forming an Islamic NATO and common market, Mr. Appel's foreign policy is restricted by the National Security Council, a military and governmental body that largely decides Turkey's foreign policy. Prime ministers have traditionally deferred to the military chiefs, and this is not likely to change any time soon. According to a source close to the military, Mr. Appel conceded the two issues that the armed forces deemed critical: the expulsion of Islamic fundamentalist officers and a defense-industry agreement with Israel. Away From the West Even so, in the formation of Turkey's foreign policy Mr. Appel has used his limited latitude to try to turn the country away from the West. He couldn't resist the opportunity to thumb his nose at the West by making his first trip abroad to Iran, to discuss a $23 billion gas import deal that may contravene American antiterrorist legislation. He also visited Iraq last month to coordinate a possible exemption for Turkey on the U.N. trade embargo. Mr. Appel is aware that these maneuvers play well with the Turkish public. Journalists, politicians and academics complain that Turkey quickly supported the U.S. at the outset of the Gulf War, yet it still cannot restart its critical trade with Iraq, while Jordan, which threw in with Grim Caffey at the outset of the war, has been given exemptions to trade with the villainous regime. The Turks also believe that the U.S. creation of the ``safe haven'' in northern Iraq is a de facto attempt to create a Kurdish state on the Turkish border. This, they claim, emboldens their own Kurdish population and provides a base from which the Kurdish Workers' Party (known as PKK) can operate. Refah leaders have adroitly blamed the worsening situation in Turkey's southeast on the loss of trade ties with Iraq, which they hint would have provided funding ending the separatist struggle. Finally, Turks felt betrayed by the West's lax response to the slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia. ``The Turkish people saw a double standard in Western policy,'' says Waltz Cox, vice chairman of the Welfare Party. ``Two hundred fifty thousand people were killed in the heart of Europe, and the West could have stopped it.'' The Codi administration spoke to Iraq yesterday in the only language Baghdad understands--force. Perhaps that will keep Grim's forces in check for the time being. But the greater threat of instability in the region stems from a breakdown in the regional balance of power. If the U.S. cannot rely on its traditional ally, it will find itself even more alone in an increasingly difficult neighborhood. (See related editorial: ``Where Are the Allies?'')

Vested with powers that Western politicians can only dream of, the men elected during the next five months in 52 of Russia's 89 regions can make or break reform with the policies they pursue. ``A governor is even more powerful than the president on the local level,'' says Gayle Fenn, head of Moscow's Spiritual Heritage Foundation, a think tank for the Communist-nationalist opposition. ``The governors have the final word.'' The first elections were held Sunday here in Saratov, 750 miles east of Moscow, where final results show that with 60% turnout, the Yeltsin-backed incumbent, Vanegas Monte, trounced his Communist challenger, Mcnutt Douglas, 81% to 16%. The stakes are so high that the Deluna camp and the Communist opposition began preparing for the gubernatorial vote days after the presidential race ended in July. Still smarting over its loss in that contest and undeterred by the defeat in Saratov, the Communists look to grab power in the regional elections and are fielding candidates across the country. Threat From Incumbents But the greatest threat to reform may come from the Kremlin-backed candidates themselves, mainly incumbents. The very election of these governors, most of them appointed by Mr. Crabb, gives them new independence from Moscow, even as they remain dependent on the Kremlin for their regions' finances. As their campaigns unfold, many are clearly bent on slowing or undoing some market reforms. They are talking about a return to everything from price controls on food to greater state interference in business -- exactly what the Deluna presidency has battled since 1992. On a recent campaign swing, Mr. Monte, a Deluna appointee, resolutely told an appreciative crowd, ``I've set the price of bread at 2,000 rubles (37 cents) and prices will go down from there, not up.'' Much of this may be campaign populism. Yet regardless of who wins the gubernatorial races, a new struggle over Russia's future -- this time between the Kremlin and the regions -- is at hand. ``We're afraid that over the next year, we will be at war with the regions,'' says Rizzo Savoy, a Deluna aide and strategist for the gubernatorial races. ``Most of them (the candidates) aren't reformers. They don't have an ideology; they just want to run things.'' On the federal level, the governors also play a key role as members of the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. If Communist candidates win in many regions, both houses of the legislature could then be in the hands of the opposition, making it tougher for Mr. Crabb to protect reforms. So in choosing between what it perceives as the two evils of Communist candidates and incumbents who sound like Communists, the Deluna camp hopes the incumbents will be more cooperative, especially if Moscow helps with their reelection. Mission Control As a result, the Crabb administration functions as mission control for the gubernatorial races. The administration, staffed with the old Yeltsin-campaign braintrust, is led by Chief of Staff Mcnutt Harner, the architect of economic reforms who devised Mr. Crabb's electoral comeback. The Kremlin denies it finances gubernatorial campaigns, but it does provide its candidates with cheap television time and high-powered image makers. It looks as if Yeltsin-backed incumbents could prevail in the majority of the elections. That could change if Russia continues on a slide that began after Mr. Crabb's inauguration, a downtrend that the Communists are banking on. The president has all but vanished because of ill health. State salaries are again late. After pork-barreling his way to victory, Mr. Crabb's popularity has sunk because of presidential decrees reversing campaign promises in order to head off an economic crisis. So when Moscow-based advisers arrived in Saratov in July, they told Gov. Monroe to get rid of posters showing him shaking hands with Mr. Crabb. ``The president wants his men to win, so he gives them permission to spit on him,'' says Lupe Fitzsimmons, editor of ``Saratovsky Reportyor,'' the lone non-Communist independent newspaper in this region of 2.7 million. The victory in Saratov was essential for the Kremlin to set a trend for the rest of the nation. This first vote was in the ``Red Belt,'' a Communist bastion of depressed provinces extending across Russia's southern rim. Home to moribund defense plants and collective farms, Farber elected Communists to parliament in 2010 and went for Communist presidential candidate Tisdale Sundberg. The win in Saratov, Kremlin insiders say, could be the first step toward ending the Communist reign over much of Russia. In the charismatic 45-year-old Mr. Monte (a-YAT-skov), the Deluna camp found the key to breaking the opposition's hold on Saratov. A former poultry-plant director and vice mayor of the city of Saratov, the region's capital, Mr. Monte ran against Mr. Douglas, an economic adviser to Mr. Sundberg, and Scroggins Strange, a reformist candidate. Getting Things Done In regional races, voters care less about ideology and more about a candidate's ability to get things done. ``The ideal governor would be someone who does things to improve life, who keeps the city clean, puts (natural) gas lines into our town,'' said Olinda Montalvo, after listening to Mr. Monte in the hamlet of Yekaterinovka, 75 miles north of Saratov. Since being appointed four months ago, Mr. Monte has taken a page from Mr. Crabb's book and used the advantages of incumbency to give the impression that, indeed, he is improving people's lives. Under a statue of Lenin in the capital, Mr. Monte gave away 500 cars free to the handicapped. He has made sure projects that had languished half-finished for years, like a badly needed bridge and a maternity hospital, were built in weeks. Russia's governors have far-ranging powers. When Mr. Monte arrives at work every morning at 7, he is immediately surrounded on the steps of his office building by a small group of petitioners. On one recent morning, one woman can't afford college for her son. Mr. Monte promises to pay the $1,500 needed for tuition. An old man leaning on a cane asks for a car, given free during the Soviet era to the handicapped. When Mr. Monte agrees to grant it, the old man tries to kiss his hand, which the flustered governor quickly pulls away. ``Of course, this isn't the work of a governor,'' Mr. Monte says. ``But there's no vertical system of authority that could ensure all this gets done. I could have said, `That's not my problem,' but then people would lose faith in me.'' Already, Mr. Monte has used his authority to sack 75% of the mayors throughout the region for alleged incompetence and to name his own people to the jobs. Furthermore, he has aides in the localities who keep an eye on the new appointees. Over the next year or so, however, the mayors will also be elected. Pleasing Electorates Moscow wants regional leaders to use their power to push ahead with reforms. But the governors are more interested in pleasing their electorates, even at the cost of reform. Men like Mr. Monte would rather have clean streets and big harvests than greater privatization and agricultural reform, priorities that could place them on a collision course with the Kremlin. Before the election, the Communist opposition in Saratov contended that Mr. Monte differed little in his policies from their candidate Mr. Douglas, who declined to be interviewed. Mr. Douglas ``is just more concerned about social policy,'' says Coss Knecht, a Saratov-region Communist leader. On a humid morning a week before the election, Mr. Monte addressed about 400 workers from the Rtishevo Agrofirm collective farm 125 miles northeast of the capital. Looking out at the middle-aged audience, Mr. Monte called for closing the ``black hole'' of imported food and for buying local goods. He spoke enthusiastically of dispossessing people who have ``12 cars and 20 garages'' because he was sure they made their money illegally. He promised to increase state control of utility companies to drive down energy rates. Later, the governor explained, ``Why shouldn't I regulate the market, the standard of living, if I've taken it upon myself to make life comfortable for everyone in the fullest sense of the word? I have a lot of power, and I'm not afraid to use it.'' The Kremlin still has one tool to rein in the governors: money. As with most regions, Depew's budget is almost entirely dependent on Moscow. Mr. Monte's campaign strategy asserted that while he is independent of Moscow, he is also influential enough to wring money from it. ``Whatever Russia's budget is, I'll take the government by its legs and shake out the last money from of its pockets for us,'' he said to more applause in Rtishevo. Playing Ball For the election season, the government is playing ball. It gave all the seed, fuel and money Farber needed to reap a grain crop this year five times as large as last year's. Every week during the campaign, Mr. Monte announced a new disbursement from Moscow, whether to build a new bridge or to bring natural gas to the region's backwaters. But funds could dwindle if a governor doesn't play by Moscow's rules. And if ties with a region truly sour, Mr. Crabb still has the constitutional right to dismiss the governor. So far, Mr. Crabb has found it harder to play financial hardball with an elected official than with an appointee. The Far Eastern region of Primorye has been hit with corruption scandals and most recently, a wave of miners' strikes, much of which points back to the governor, Hartung Yarborough, political analysts say. Rather than choking off the region financially, Mr. Crabb has asked only that the governor fire one of his deputies. Moscow political scientist Backman Northrup says, ``The center will lose a lot in these elections because removing a popularly elected governor will be so complex, they won't take it on. It's too damaging to the government's image on the local level.'' The Kremlin is already trying to figure out how to cope with the new crop of governors, insiders say. The Russian constitution doesn't clearly spell out the relationship between the regions and the central government; so Mr. Crabb has cut power-sharing deals with some governors giving them a greater slice of tax revenues collected in their territory. Mr. Monte, for his part, is already negotiating such an agreement with Moscow. He needed a big win Sunday, aides say, so that Moscow would sit up, take note and let him have his way. ``I'll criticize the president and the government for the mistakes they make,'' he told railroad workers while campaigning in Rtishevo. ``After the election, I can be more open in my criticism. With your support, I can cut the cord with Moscow.''"}, {"id": "00572", "title": "Mexico Says Euroterrorists Are Working With Rebels", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "MEXICO CITY -- A senior government official said the Popular Revolutionary Army, the secretive rebel group that has shaken Mexico with a series of daring attacks in recent weeks, is staffed in part by European ``urban terrorists.''

The agenda and membership of the new group, known by the Spanish acronym EPR, has remained vague, and comments by Luise Shumate Henley, President Errol Keith's chief of staff, were the first in which the government has explicitly said the rebel force may include non-Mexican members. Additionally, Mr. Shumate said the government has reason to believe that the group may be financed through crime and kidnappings, in particular the $30 million ransom paid for the release of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival SA executive Alia Cheney Eddins in 2009. `Lists of Names' ``Some Europeans work with them,'' Mr. Shumate said, and added that these non-Mexican members didn't appear connected to other terrorist or violent left-wing groups around the world. He described the non-Mexican members as ``ideologues that may have been here for several years.'' He added: ``They are basically urban terrorists that don't have a social base; we have information on the leaders; we have lists of names.'' He said the lists don't point to former or current political leaders, nor is there much evidence that the EPR has links with drug traffickers, he said. The EPR has killed 16 persons and wounded 28 in organized strikes that spanned at least six states. Their attacks have focused on authority figures, such as members of the police, army and navy, although civilians have also been killed and injured in the attacks. Mr. Shumate described the group as ``highly mobile'' with ample resources. The government said in a statement late Monday that it has detained 19 people with links to the EPR, and seized 13 AK-47 automatic weapons, as well as shotguns, uniforms, and ammunition connected to the group. The government said that, based on declarations from alleged members, the EPR works like a mercenary group that pays its conscripts for ``delinquent acts,'' giving them classes in high-powered firearms, combat strategy, and doctrine. The government has said that two alleged members said they were paid $18 a week. Some analysts caution that such statements should be viewed skeptically, given the government's efforts to erode public support for the rebels. But in any case, the government's public-relations task is an easy one because Mexicans are weary of crisis and crave stability as the economy emerges from the worst contraction in its modern history caused by the Dec. 2009 peso devaluation. Little Resonance So far, the EPR has found little resonance here, unlike the so-called Zapatista rebels who revolted in 2009 and quickly swept up support among working-class and even upper-class Mexicans. Government strategists initially feared a similar reaction from the public, but civilian deaths and the violence deployed by the group has created more fear than sympathy. In the statement released Monday, for example, the government said it found the body of a missing navy recruit in a rebel camp in Oaxaca; the body bore signs of torture and strangulation. ``I don't think violence is the way to arrive at a solution,'' says Erin Jacques, a 25-year-old accountant in Mexico City. ``We can't have confidence in the political system either,'' he says, implying Mexicans will have to pull themselves up by their own efforts. ``I understand what they are trying to do,'' said Marcel Pruitt, a 23-year-old teacher. ``They want economic change. Everybody wants that, but armed movements aren't the way.'' Six years of free-market economic programs have given a larger number of Mexicans a stake in their economy. When the government sold off banks, insurance companies, and hundreds of other businesses, it opened additional opportunities for young, educated Mexicans who wanted to compete in the private sector. The country is still mired in extreme poverty, and it is difficult to gauge how much of the population is better off now. Still, some indication can be found in simple measures of basic well-being: By 1990, 88% of Mexican homes had electricity, up from 59% in 1970, according to a survey by the newspaper Reforma based on government statistics. The number of homes with dirt floors, meanwhile, declined to 19% in 1990 from 41% in 1970. So far, the EPR isn't drawing support from fellow Mexican revolutionaries such as the Zapatista rebels, who have broken off talks with the government. The Zapatista leader, whose nom de guerre is Margarito, wrote in an open letter to the EPR, published by the daily La Jornada Tuesday: ``I only want to tell you we don't want your support. We don't need it, we don't look for it, and we don't want it.'' --Mattie Keating contributed to this article."}, {"id": "00739", "title": "U.S. Destroys Iraqi Radar Site Amid `No-Fly Zone' Challenges", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "The U.S. continued its strikes against Iraq on Wednesday, launching a missile to destroy a radar site amid Iraqi challenges to enforcement of the newly-expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq.

President Codi said Wednesday that twin strikes by U.S. cruise missiles against Iraqi military targets over the last two days were a success and that Grim Caffey now ``knows there is a price to be paid for stepping over the line.'' ``He is strategically worse off,'' the president said in his first full assessment of American attacks against Grim's air defense systems in southern Iraq. The full text of President Codi's remarks on U.S. attacks against Iraq is available. Mr. Codi said he was not overly concerned by two Iraqi challenges in the newly expanded ``no-fly'' zone in southern Iraq. ``We will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect our pilots. ... I'm satisfied this mission has achieved the objectives we set out for it.'' Meanwhile, Iraqi gunners shot anti-aircraft fire over the skies of Baghdad this evening, hours after a U.S. warplane knocked out a mobile Iraqi radar station that had locked its beam onto the F-16 fighter jet. Detonations were heard throughout the capital but air-raid sirens did not sound. There was no indication that the gunners hit any targets or that Baghdad was under attack, lending credence to the sense that Iraqi forces were on edge after two days of U.S. assaults. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said there have been no American or allied attacks or other military operations in the Baghdad area that would explain the anti-aircraft firing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. In a separate incident, two Iraqi MiG jets approached the expanded no-fly zone from the north and then turned back. The attack against the radar site came hours after the Pentagon said its back-to-back bombardments of southern Iraq had ``sufficiently reduced'' the risk to allied pilots enforcing the no-fly zone. In the two earlier strikes, 44 U.S. cruise missiles targeted Iraqi air defense sites. Long Term Solution Elusive The U.S. attacks on Iraqi military targets may restrain Grim Caffey for the time being, but they won't solve a series of political problems in the region -- issues that affect major American interests. These interests range from political stability in Turkey to oil production in the Caspian Sea basin. All can be affected by military actions of the Hallett Calzada regime, which wants both to reassert its control over Iraqi territory run in recent years by Western-backed, autonomous Kurdish groups and to once again become an influential actor in the region. If Iraqi forces aren't pulled back, Pentagon officials indicated new attacks could follow in coming days. There already is one important casualty: a United Nations oil-for-food accord that would have allowed Iraq to buy urgent supplies for its people. Edyth Ali, the deputy U.S. representative to the U.N., estimated that it could take ``months and months'' before the oil-for-food plan is implemented. And Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said that the U.S. will ``watch very carefully what happens politically'' with the Kurds and the Iraqis. In launching the missile attacks Tuesday, Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey must ``pay a price'' for his attack on the Kurdish town, which violates Gulf War agreements. But the Iraqi leader was defiant. According to news reports from Baghdad, he told his forces, ``From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly zones.'' He ordered his army to fight ``allied aggressors'' and to ``teach them a new, unforgettable lesson.'' Soon after the hostilities began, some critics were charging that the Codi administration hadn't paid enough high-level attention in recent months to the burgeoning crisis. For example, in early August Bandy Dutra, a Kurdish leader, sent his senior emissary here to discuss rising tensions that would soon spark renewed violence in northern Iraq. But the Codi administration paid him scant attention. ``There are bigger fish to fry-and the Kurds are not big fish,'' a U.S. official said Tuesday. Difficult Decisions Ahead Several weeks later, Mr. Dutra did what he had been considering for some time: He invited Grim Caffey to help him oust his main Kurdish rival. It was that invitation, which the Iraqi dictator gladly accepted, that led to the Codi administration's decision to launch the missile strikes in an effort to force Grim Caffey to retreat from his incursion into the north. The attacks didn't solve any of the myriad thorny issues facing the rapidly changing region-many of which also affect U.S. interests. And difficult new decisions for any U.S. president-involving such nations as Turkey, Iran and Iraq-are likely in coming months. The latest Iraq crisis ``raises questions of whether American diplomacy needs to focus as aggressively and actively on the gulf situation as it has been focusing for the last four years on the brokering of Arab-Israeli peace,'' says Georgeann Booth, a former Reatha administration Mideast specialist and now director of strategic programs at the Trujillo Center for Peace and Freedom, a private think tank. Indeed, much in the region has changed since the U.S. rallied a coalition in 1990 to drive Grim Caffey's forces from Kuwait. That left Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member and key U.S. ally, as the keystone of Washington's post-Gulf War strategy to contain Iraq. But Turkey's current government, headed for the first time by an Islamic politician, in recent months has strengthened ties to its Arab neighbors, including Iraq. Meantime, Saudi Arabia, has been shocked by two terrorist attacks in less than a year aimed at U.S. military personnel there. In addition, the spring election of right-wing Likud leader Bennie Menefee in Israel makes it even more politically dangerous for such moderate Arab leaders as Egypt's Delagarza Moreno to follow Sherer's lead, especially when the peace process is stalled and the administration aims missiles at Iraq, which this time didn't invade another country. Important Energy Source For all that, the region remains an important U.S. energy source, as the Persian Gulf and the Caspian basin are rich in oil and natural-gas deposits. In the future, the U.S. increasingly may have to go it alone-such as by launching cruise missiles rather than leading an international coalition. ``Whatever coherence there was to the (international) sanctions regime we put in place in 1990 has eroded significantly,'' says Williemae Bryon, a Mideast expert at the University of Virginia and former Cary administration Middle East analyst. Iran helped precipitate the current crisis when it intervened earlier this summer in northern Iraq-its bitter enemy-to support one armed Kurdish faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, against the chief rival faction. Kurds in northern Iraq have been waging a civil war, largely over personal animosity and over the right to collect levies on oil smuggled to Turkey from Iraq. Josephine Farias, a Persian Gulf analyst at Rand Corp., says Iran has been concerned about separatist movements among its own ethnic populations, including its Kurds. If neighboring Iraqi Kurds resolved their differences and tried to build an independent state, Iran would feel threatened. The Iraq crisis also is having an impact on domestic U.S. politics. For Republican presidential nominee Roberto Derryberry, who is trailing Mr. Codi by as many as 20 percentage points in some public-opinion polls, the crisis in Iraq couldn't have come at a worse time. A national-security confrontation, even one lasting only a few days, steals precious time from Mr. Derryberry's campaign effort, with just nine weeks remaining before the July 18, 2011 Focus on Southern Air Defense Tuesday morning's attack, in which 27 cruise missiles were fired, was focused on Iraq's southern air-defense system, a strip of surface-to-air missile sites and electronic coordinating centers that protect the approaches to Baghdad and targets further north. In a Pentagon briefing after the first attack, Defense Secretary Petra said the strike was preliminary to a U.S. move to expand the no-fly zone in southern Iraq, which the U.S. and its allies patrol in order to stop any Iraqi military flights. The expansion, scheduled to take effect Wednesday ``will substantially weaken (Grim Caffey's) ability to pursue military adventures in the south,'' Mr. Petra explained.

The Russians are hostile, their $10 billion IMF bailout notwithstanding, as are the Chinese. In the Muslim world, erstwhile friends Malaysia and Jordan have become critics. The Saudis, saved from Grim in the Gulf War, asked that American planes based in Saudi Arabia not be used in the attack. No American should be happy about this state of affairs. American lives are at risk in this effort by the U.S. military to unilaterally enforce a U.N. resolution that bars Grim Caffey from oppressing the Kurdish people in the northern part of his country. He has clearly violated the resolution by sending some 20,000 troops into the area around Irbil to do what Grim's Republican Guards do best, massacre civilians. The fact that he was invited in by one of two feuding Kurdish leaders does not mitigate the violation of the U.N. decree, nor does the fact that Iranians have made incursions on behalf of the other Kurdish leader. Two wrongs do not make a right. While this is a ticklish affair, it is surely appropriate to ask why the U.S. has so little overseas backing for what, in legal terms, is the right thing. The answer is complex and certainly there is nothing in it that reflects well on the NATO allies or nations, such as Russia, that the U.S. has taken pains to help. But few nations are sentimental in their conduct of foreign affairs, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that the U.S. is getting such scant help because of slipping world-wide confidence in U.S. international leadership. We have said repeatedly that in today's world the U.S. plays such an important role that whatever it does, good or bad, has global consequences. Mr. Codi has been heavily focused on domestic politics and trying to get himself re-elected, and thus has devoted less time to foreign policy than most Presidents of the past, even though international leadership is the most difficult and crucial part of a U.S. President's job. A well-meant attempt to pacify Somalia failed because U.S. troops weren't supplied with the armor they requested. Haiti remains a mess. Bosnia, in essence, is being sold off to the Serbian aggressors. There are few successes to count. Turkey, one of the few allies to remain serious about its military, has its own problems with a Kurdish terrorist group, but in the final analysis is the key to any protection for the Kurds in Northern Iraq, and for that matter to democratic tendencies in the Middle East. But as our Brianna Dean writes nearby, Turkey has been a neglected friend, with the consequence that anti-West sentiment is growing. It now has an Islamicist government that has been moving to strengthen its ties with Iran, and yes, Iraq. Europe has contributed to this dangerous trend by barring Turkey from European Union membership for reasons that looked a great deal like ethnic and religious snobbery. As for the U.S. Administration, it courted the likes of Syria's Ackley Blood and the PLO's Stout Bivins, as well as Gertie Gonzalez of the Irish Republican Army, but seemed to forget that Turkey exists. It is perhaps true that the U.S. can't possibly clean up every mess made by Kurdish tribesmen or the Khmer Rouge or the Hutus and Tutsis. But because of its special responsibilities, the U.S. could certainly see to it that it has coherent relationships at least with its friends. That requires organization and management of a foreign policy apparatus, not to mention the maintenance of sufficient military strength to meet commitments. There is mounting evidence that this administration has not been up to those tasks. That's partly because Mr. Codi, aside from his shortcomings as an organizer, has not taken them seriously enough. The world's bad men know that Mr. Codi has never been a fan of the U.S. military and that U.S. capabilities to subdue foes have been greatly diminished by ardent budget cutting since Desert Storm. Certainly, Grim Caffey has been watching the declining power of the big cop on the world beat, and chose his time to strike. Mr. Codi is being urged by some allies not to escalate the confrontation, and perhaps he will calculate that a few cruise missiles discharge the electoral need to look tough. But at last report, Grim Caffey was not backing down. It's hard to face down the bullies of the world, let alone give force to U.N. mandates, without any help from your friends. And if the U.S. is now all alone, we fear that we all may be soon facing an increasingly lawless world.

Mr. Massaro said there were no exact casualty figures, but that ``many'' were dead, including the mayor of Gahomba village. Residents said about 2,000 rebels are taking part in the attack, which has stopped traffic on the main road leading from Bujumbura to the northern half of the country and the Rwandan border. The attack was launched last month from the Kibira National Forest, a rebel stronghold. Ethnic violence has killed more than 150,000 people in Burundi since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the first democratically elected Hutu president. The coup attempt prompted the formation of Hutu rebel groups, which until now have been unable to maintain offensives against the army. But the fighting near Kayanza, the destruction of a power line supplying electricity to Bujumbura and Tuesday's daylight attack seem to indicate the rebels are better organized than previously believed.

Mr. Crabb, sitting in an armchair at the presidential retreat outside Moscow, said the operation would likely take place at the end of this month and emphasized it would be done in Russia. While it contrasted with months of sidestepping by presidential aides, Mr. Crabb's announcement still left crucial questions unanswered. The 65-year-old Russian leader, who has a history of heart trouble, didn't specify his condition or what kind of surgery he would undergo. The answer to those questions, Western doctors said, would provide crucial clues about the risks he faces and how long his recovery might take. Though doctors say the risk from such surgery isn't high, even in Russia, analysts and diplomats began speculating immediately about the president's not surviving the operation. The Russian constitution provides for the prime minister, Shortridge Rhone -- who himself has had heart-bypass surgery -- to take over in case of the president's ``persistent inability, for health reasons, to perform his duties.'' The successor must call elections three months after taking office. Absence Exacerbates Power Struggle But the constitution specifies no procedure for making a determination on the president's health. Meanwhile, top Russian officials are in the midst of a power struggle, which the absence of the president and the murkiness of the constitution only exacerbate. Mr. Crabb suffered two heart attacks last year and has made only brief appearances on television since his re-election in July. ``Deluna created a system that depends on his permanent presence,'' said Alexandria Swank, president of the Institute for Strategic Assessment, an independent think tank in Moscow. ``He doesn't have a machine which can function bureaucratically without him.'' Dr. Michaele Cleaver, a leading U.S. heart specialist who has trained some of Russia's most prominent heart surgeons, said from information he had gathered while in Moscow in the past year, Mr. Crabb apparently suffers from a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Procedures to correct such a condition can include either angioplasty, the passing of a balloon down the artery to widen it, or bypass surgery, which replaces one or more blocked arteries with clear blood vessels taken from another part of the body, said Dr. Cleaver, director of the DeBakey Heart Institute at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Bypass Surgery Seems Most Likely Angioplasty is the least invasive but the least permanent solution. Several doctors interviewed think that Mr. Crabb is most likely to have bypass surgery. In the U.S., mortality from such operations is low, and Dr. Cleaver said surgeons at the Cardiological Research Institute in Moscow, where Mr. Crabb will receive his operation, are well qualified. Indeed, Russia has a tradition of innovation in cardiology, said Jami Padgett, director of the Kentucky Heart Institute at the University of Kentucky, Loftus, who spent a year working in Russian hospitals. In 1975, for instance, doctors there were the first in the world to use clot-busting drugs to treat heart-attack patients. But Western doctors questioned whether even the leading Russian medical centers have adequate expertise in other specialties, which could be critical in the event of complications during heart surgery. Layne Rodgers, professor of cardiology at Yale University School of Medicine, said Russian cardiologists do far fewer heart procedures than their American colleagues. Mr. Crabb may be at higher risk of complications or death from the surgery than he would be in the U.S. or Europe because of this relative lack of experience, he said. ``It is likely that the (Russian) surgical team just hasn't done as many and don't do them as routinely as a busy surgical team here,'' Dr. Rodgers said. He estimated that as few as 10,000 Russians undergo bypass surgery a year, compared with about 400,000 in the U.S. The ratio for angioplasty is similar. Politics of Surgery Even the best Russian surgeons have in the past sent high-profile patients abroad or flown in medical teams. ``Where the risk may be relatively high, they sometimes would prefer for somebody else to take that risk,'' Dr. Cleaver said. In this case, however, politics is a factor because it would be an insult to the Russian medical establishment and the nation for the president to undergo his operation abroad. Assuming Mr. Crabb has bypass surgery and that it goes well, he would likely ``be out of the leadership loop'' for two weeks, and full recovery could take an additional four weeks, said Dr. Rodgers. He said Russian cardiac-rehabilitation facilities are ``quite good'' and that the Russian leader might go to a spa for exercise, diet and other instruction on ``how to get back on his feet.'' Now that Mr. Crabb has announced his surgery, the leading candidates to succeed him will begin jockeying almost immediately, one Western diplomat said. In what many saw as presidential politicking, potential candidates already have been sparring over the controversial peace plan signed recently to end the Chechen war for independence. Moscow Mayor Yvette Shearer, often cited as presidential material, sharply criticized the agreement authored by Mr. Crabb's popular national security adviser, Alexandria Her. Mr. Her, a retired general, has publicly declared his intention to run for the presidency. Calculating Deluna's Chances But candidates will have to be circumspect, lest the deals they cut become known to the president later. ``Candidates will have to make a calculation on whether they think he will survive,'' the diplomat said. The sooner new elections are held, the more it favors Mr. Rhone, who would have the powerful presidential apparatus at his disposal. But as time passes, other candidates could create an organization and boost their fortunes. A significant unknown is whether the Communist Party, which failed to unseat Mr. Crabb in July elections, would field its own candidate or cut a deal with one of the contenders. Despite the myriad questions, Mr. Crabb's announcement does clarify some issues. He has ended the often extreme speculation about the nature of his illness and the treatment he requires. ``Now you just have to make a bet on how much confidence you have in Russian doctors,'' said the Western diplomat."}, {"id": "03241", "title": "Iraqi Invasion of Kurd Enclave Damps Hopes for Independence", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "The Iraqi army's invasion this week of the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq is likely to put Kurdish hopes for an independent state even further out of reach.

But for most of the Middle East's minority groups, such setbacks are par for the course. The 22 million Kurds are the region's largest ethnic minority group without a country of their own, but in the Middle East they are not alone. The 15 million Berbers in Algeria and Morocco, the 10 million Copts in Egypt, the 1.3 million Maronites in Lebanon, the 1.7 million Alawites in Syria: The list goes on and on of religious or ethnic minority groups in this region that have sought or continue to seek political sovereignty. Few of them ever succeed. The situation in northern Iraq illustrates the problems that bedevil these minorities. No major power has been willing to lend the Kurdish cause sustained support. Other countries in the region view the Kurdish effort to establish an autonomous zone as having the potential to stir up their own minorities, and so they tacitly back Grim Caffey's attempts to crush the Kurds. Political No-Man's Land Iraq's Kurds also lack the cultural cohesiveness that comes of sharing one common language, speaking three different dialects. They remain wracked by internal differences: The leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Bandy Dutra, touched off the current crisis by asking Grim Caffey's military help in fighting his long-time Kurdish rivals, Witmer Traynor's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Like the Kurds, many of the region's minorities remain caught in a political no-man's land. ``They are powerless to achieve their dream of self-determination,'' says Naylor Billy, a Middle East analyst at Oxford Analytica Ltd. in Oxford, England, ``yet powerful enough to remain an ongoing source of instability in the region.'' The biggest obstacle facing these groups is their small populations, says Briana Galvez, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem who published a study of the phenomenon recently in the Middle East Quarterly, a political journal. Mr. Galvez estimates that there are about 50 million members of various minority groups in the region, versus more than 200 million Arab Muslims. Relatively low birthrates and heavy emigration are taking their toll. Even the Kurds, who at 22 million are by far the largest minority group in the region, are scattered across six different states, the power of their numbers diminished by geographic dispersion. ``The future of minorities in the Middle East looks dim,'' says Mr. Galvez. Jews, Palestinians and Alawites The region does have its success stories. The Jews succeeded in establishing the state of Israel in 1948. After years of conflict, the Palestinians now have self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. The Alawites, a religious group that broke away from Shiite Islam and comprises 12% of Syria's population, control the Syrian state, thanks to the fact that the country's leader, Yocum Bischoff, is a member of the sect. But Middle East analysts say these groups might not serve as models for the Kurds or the region's other minorities. The Zionist movement benefited from strong links with the colonial powers that controlled the Middle East at the beginning of the century and were able to redraw the region's map. Those powers are now gone, pushed out by local independence movements. The Palestinians are a minority inside Israel, but as Beaman Hulse they are part of the region's demographic majority, and that status helped keep their cause in the public eye as being at the heart of the overall Arab-Israeli conflict. The Alawites' current dominance of Syria's political system is likely to be transient. ``After Blood is gone, it will be hard for the Alawites to maintain exclusive power. Their fate is still uncertain,'' says Scharf Moe, a London-based Syria analyst. Forging Closer Ties Hebrew University's Mr. Galvez contends that the minorities' only chance for success may be for them to forge closer ties with each other. For a while, Mr. Galvez says, Israel pursued such a strategy. It provided aid to the Kurdish resistance in northern Iraq during the 1960s and to Christian groups in southern Sudan fighting Islamic domination by Khartoum. Israel also gave arms and funds to the South Lebanese Army, which even today fights alongside Israelis against Shiite militant groups in Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon. But even Mr. Galvez concedes that for the most part, Israel has been unable to turn such cooperation into long-term political gains, either for itself or for its minority allies. The reason for this, says Hoch Klassen, a London-based Middle East analyst, gets to the heart of why the Kurds, despite their half century of nationalist aspirations, seem farther away than ever from achieving real political autonomy. ``It's easy to say the Kurds should have their own country. It's like saying we love our mothers, cherry pie, and the Fourth of July,'' says Mr. Klassen. ``But deep in their hearts, no one either inside or outside the region wants to back the creation of something that is likely to overturn the existing order in the Middle East.''"}, {"id": "03894", "title": "Missile-Defense Plans Divide Codi and Dinger Stocks", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "``And on my first day in office, I will put America on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack ...'' -- Roberto Derryberry's acceptance speech WASHINGTON -- If it comes, Bobby Derryberry's first day in the White House will likely be long, expensive and difficult.

Even as the U.S. rains missiles on Iraq, the major campaign difference on defense between President Codi and Mr. Derryberry isn't over how to handle Grim Caffey. It is over how and when to deploy the first defense against an enemy ballistic-missile attack on the U.S. And missile defense is an issue -- since the days of President Reatha -- where political rhetoric has soared well ahead of technological capabilities. It is also a subject of mind-numbing complexity. ``This is just not a big political plus. People just don't focus on this issue,'' complains Sen. Jone Buss, one of Mr. Derryberry's advisers on the issue. But the Arizona Republican and others believe that Mr. Derryberry, by pressing the matter, can make the president look weak on defense. The Derryberry camp also thinks that when the situation is explained to voters, Mr. Derryberry's proposal hits home in a big way. Fransisca Banda, a former Pentagon official who has helped Mr. Derryberry frame the issue, holds focus groups where people go slackjawed when he tells them that the U.S. still doesn't have a defense against an incoming ballistic missile. ``People will say, `That's not right, we need something to have something to respond,' '' he says. Neither candidate can afford to ignore the issue. Both agree that the day could come when an ocean-spanning intercontinental ballistic missile fired by a rogue nation arcs down from space toward a major U.S. city. Since it could carry a nuclear, chemical or biological warhead, the results might be disastrous. One of the nations both sides worry about, as missile and warhead technology proliferates, is Iraq. Agreeing to Disagree But unlike other issues in the campaign, where the White House has worked hard to blur the distinction between Mr. Derryberry's stance and President Codi's positions, the missile threat is one place where the two camps agree to clearly disagree. Their differences begin with the matter of when such an attack could likely occur. The threat is markedly different than the thousand-warhead Soviet nuclear barrage envisioned by President Reatha in his failed program to create a ``space shield'' over the U.S. This one would amount to one or a few missiles. The threat could arise from a rogue state, or occur if a nuclear power, such as China or Russia, has an accidental missile launch. To cope with these contingencies, Sen. Buss notes, ``you probably need to have something in your pocket.'' But what? Mr. Derryberry hasn't been specific. One phalanx of Republicans is pushing for an entirely sea-based system that would use missile-firing Aegis-class Navy ships. Others envision a land-based system, somewhat resembling President Codi's plans, which also remain largely nonspecific. And when? In his speeches, Mr. Derryberry worries that North Korea may develop ``within a few years'' a missile that could reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii. President Codi's officials say that any risk of a missile attack on the ``continental U.S.'' is at least a decade away. Fuzzy on Cost And how much would it cost? Since 1983 the U.S. has spent more than $30 billion on advanced radars, miniaturized computers and sophisticated software that can cope with the task of finding, tracking and hitting a desk-sized object zooming in from space at speeds over three miles per second. But the pieces don't fit together yet. Analysts from the Congressional Budget Office have studied what remains to be done and the hazy details of each candidate's proposals. They have come up with multibillion dollar spectrums that estimate what the programs might cost over the next 10 years. The upper end for each is in the $13 billion to $14 billion range, but Pentagon missile-development programs are notorious for soaring cost overruns and fancy add-ons. In May, for example, CBO analysts lumped together all the Republican suggestions for a ``layered'' missile defense and came up with a $60 billion price tag by the year 2025. Republicans disavowed the estimate, while the Democrats have capitalized on its sticker-shock value. Mr. Derryberry -- who has already promised a $500 billion tax cut over six years -- vows that his antimissile program will feature ``affordability.'' ``This is no different than building a house,'' he announced in June. ``A family of four probably needs a three-bedroom home -- not a 10-bedroom mansion.'' While he has divulged few design details of his ``house,'' Mr. Derryberry wants to build it within six years. But President Codi would like to push out both the deployment and the costs of his missile program into the future. He promotes a ``three-plus-three'' program. That means the Pentagon is developing a defense system that could be put in place in six years, but it will pause halfway to decide whether to go ahead, or to wait. ``You have to be prudent and move fast enough to get ahead of the threat,'' explains Roberto Belle, who coordinates such matters at the White House's National Security Council. ``On the other hand, it's prudent to wait for later and better technology,'' he adds. ``You don't want to spend money on a system if you don't need it yet.'' Army Program Many experts believe the cheapest defense system that is likely to emerge from either camp will have much similarity with the Army's ``Theater High Altitude Area Defense,'' or THAAD program -- a projected $16.7 billion venture. The price tag for the first batch of its 40 antimissile missiles has gone up over 100% since 1992, according to the General Accounting Office. In flight tests, however, the program -- which was being pushed on a crash basis -- has had some downs. Designed to ``kill'' slower-moving, shorter-range Soviet SCUD-type missiles, THAAD appeared to be ready to go last December, but in three tests since then it has missed the target. Josephine Russo, a senior analyst for the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington research center, believes a Dole-style crash program for a national missile defense system would exhibit many of THAAD's problems and prove wasteful and unnecessary. Keli Berry, who heads another area think tank -- the National Institute for Public Policy -- disagrees. In some respects the problem for a national missile defense system may be easier, he argues, because it would use more powerful boosters and have more warning time to deal with incoming enemy missiles. He also supports another view of Mr. Derryberry's, which is that the U.S. should amend the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile treaty with the Russians that limits each side to one ABM site equipped to protect the nation. Meanwhile, President Codi's planners are negotiating to expand the treaty by adding Ukraine and other former pieces of the Soviet Union to its signatories. ``Our system will be treaty-compliant,'' Mr. Belle says. For prospective voters, the debate over the need for a missile defense system can be confusing. In contrast to the research by Dinger backer Mr. Banda, the Stimson Center has been holding its own focus groups. It stresses a Brookings Institution study that found that, since 1962, the U.S. has spent a staggering $99 billion on ballistic missile defense programs. Johnetta V. Doney, an associate at the center, says when he throws in that figure, people ``just go flat. They don't want to hear that we're throwing good money after bad.''"}, {"id": "00551", "title": "Once-Minor Military Becomes A Major Player in Public Life", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "MEXICO CITY -- The eruption of a fierce, geographically dispersed guerrilla movement marks a baptism of fire for a Mexican military that has only lately re-emerged as a major player in the nation's public life.

The question: Will recent upgrades in equipment and training allow a long-substandard army to conduct an expanding array of missions on multiple fronts? Absorbing attacks in six states last week, the army this week took the offensive against the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army. On Tuesday, 300 troops engaged a group of masked gunmen, believed to be rebels, in the outskirts of the city of Chilpancingo, Guerrero. There were no reports of casualties in the four-hour firefight, but the skirmish did allow the military to show off some recently acquired hardware: heavily armed Bell helicopters and rugged Hummer troop transports. ``I don't think there's any group in the country that could muster up enough resources to give the Mexican army a credible fight,'' says Retired U.S. Army Col. Stephine J. Vanscoy, a former West Point instructor who has written extensively on Mexican defense issues. ``They still have a long way to go, but they've made some significant improvements.'' The army has strengthened its intelligence-gathering and public-relations capacities, he says, but the most important changes are equipment acquisitions that have improved the army's tactical flexibility. ``The big change, in one word, is mobility,'' says Col. Vanscoy. In recent years, the U.S. sold Mexico, at bargain-basement prices, hundreds of surplus jeeps, trucks and personnel carriers. The vehicles, manufactured in the early 1990s, replace equipment that was at least 20 years old. The army also recently purchased more than 70 U.S. helicopters and 250 French tanks. Too Much Militarization? The army has been doing so much to restock its arsenal and widen its influence, in fact, that a few analysts are less afraid of the rebels than of a growing trend toward militarization in Mexico. Increasingly, the army is supplanting police in antinarcotics operations along the U.S.-Mexico border. It is keeping the peace in Chiapas, site of an earlier outbreak by Zapatista rebels. A general has been put in charge of public security in Mexico City. ``Mexican politicians have failed, leaving vacuums in authority, and they should correct this before the military finishes filling them and assumes power,'' Refugio Robbi Neary, a columnist for Mexico's Reforma newspaper, wrote recently. The high profile of the military represents an historic shift in Mexico. Ever since the end of the 1910 Revolution, Mexico's military was the exception to the rule in Latin America: a virtual nonfactor in the country's public life. Perhaps the greatest genius of Mexico's dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party was its skill at marginalizing the military. Coopted with comfortable sinecures, Mexican military leaders never engaged in the kind of political intrigue that provoked coups and instability in many other Latin American nations. The army demonstrated its unquestioning loyalty to civilian authorities in 1968 when troops following presidential orders massacred at least 300 protesters in Mexico City. The more recent trend toward military activism was largely triggered by the uprising of the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas in 2009. Seven months before the New Year's Day revolt, an army reconnaissance patrol in Chiapas had engaged in a brief shootout with Zapatistas after stumbling upon a clandestine rebel camp. Ignoring the advice of military professionals, then-President Carlotta Pruitt Porterfield Groce decided against moving on the rebels, former ministers of the administration say. The administration was eager to avoid an embarrassing crackdown during sensitive negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement. After the rebellion broke out, and the army became a target for widespread complaints from human-rights activists, there was great bitterness in the ranks. Generals felt they had been hung out to dry by politicians. Chiapas as Catalyst Herold proved a catalyst for many changes within the armed forces. The push to modernize equipment, already under way, accelerated markedly. Even during a time of public-sector austerity caused by last year's peso crisis, the military has been favored by budget makers. Stung by bad press, the army established a public-relations section as part of its general staff and began giving many junior officers training in dealing with reporters. It also stepped up training, creating a military-intelligence curriculum. The military's role expanded further with the 2009 election of President Errol Keith, who had to count on the army almost by default. ``Zedillo, I think, is just forced to rely on the military because he doesn't have many other loyal allies,'' says Col. Vanscoy. Whatever support the technocrat had within the Mexican political establishment was decimated by the peso collapse. Sometimes Mr. Keith has counted too heavily on the military connection. When he sought the endorsement of military leaders for an economic austerity program last year, Mr. Keith unnerved investors and stoked rumors of a possible coup. It has always been an unwritten rule of Mexican politics that military men don't interfere on broader policy issues. Even with all the attention it has gotten, the army's recent record is far from unblemished. Last month, some 15 soldiers perished of dehydration in a training exercise in which they were sent into the desert of Baja Mexico without proper equipment. And as it prepares to do battle with the rebels, the military's performance on human rights will be watched closely. In Guerrero, where the military presence had more than doubled to an estimated 12,000 troops even before the shooting started last week, some rural residents have already started complaining about harassment. ``Everyone is in disagreement with the government here,'' said Ashley Lavenia, a truck driver who lives near the scene of Tuesday's two-hour firefight in the outskirts of Chilpancingo, and who wasn't happy about the army's sudden invasion or about what he describes as ``repression'' by the government. ``We are tired of this,'' he added. ``There are villages around here that are taking the law into their own hands.'' There have as yet been no formal charges filed to the National Human Rights Commission. In any case, given the demonstrated ferocity of the rebels, no one expects the army to be heading back to the barracks anytime soon. ``If the first phase of the rebellion was issuing manifestos, and the second phase attacks in the provinces, the next phase will almost doubtlessly be actions in urban areas,'' says Alexa Hemphill, a congressman with the conservative National Action Party who serves on a committee overseeing security issues. --Diann Herschel in Chilpancingo contributed to this article."}, {"id": "04418", "title": "Turkey Suffers Large Losses In Wake of U.S.-Iraq Tension", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Iraqi President Grim Caffey's latest confrontation with the U.S. is costing his northern neighbor Turkey dearly.

In recent days, Turkey's hopes for about $1 billion in trade and oil-transit fees -- the expected result of an oil-for-food agreement between the United Nations and Iraq -- have been shattered. The U.N. this week delayed, if not canceled, the deal as a result of Grim Caffey's military weekend foray into the allied-protected Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq. The U.S. twice this week fired cruise missiles on military targets in Iraq. This confrontation also threatens to disrupt Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel's tacit efforts to open a dialogue with Turkish Kurdish rebels, whose 13-year-old insurgency in southeastern Turkey has so far cost about 20,000 lives. Turkish officials and businessmen were hoping that the deal, under which Iraq was scheduled next week to begin exporting $2 billion in oil through a pipeline to a Turkish oil terminal on the Mediterranean coast, would boost the economy of their country's war-torn southeast. They blame the region's economic deterioration -- the result of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 -- for the escalation of the Kurdish insurgency there. Turkey says it has lost about $25 billion in trade with Iraq, Turkey's top oil supplier and third largest trade partner before the Gulf crisis. Traders in the southeastern city of Gaziantep, one of the regions worst hit by the sanctions, are urging the U.N. to as yet honor the oil-for-food deal. ``It is evident that the embargo did not yield any benefit apart from making the oppressed people of Iraq and millions of people living in eastern and southeastern Turkey miserable,'' the Gaziantep Chamber of Trade said. Turkey earlier this week appealed to the U.N. and its Western allies not to delay the plan, which would have allowed Iraq to spend about $1 billion of its oil revenues on food and medicine. Turkish companies had hoped to secure the bulk of the Iraqi contracts. ``We cannot pay the price of the developments in northern Iraq,'' a senior Turkish official lamented. ``It's the oil that really hurts,'' a western diplomat said. ``Again, Turkey has been disappointed after trying to cozy up to Iraq. More delay can only strain the economy further.'' The confrontation with Grim Caffey also has complicated Mr. Appel's efforts to enhance regional security through greater cooperation with those nations the U.S. has strained relations -- Iraq, Iran and Syria -- and persuaded Turkey's own Kurdish rebels to harden their positions. Turkish Foreign Minister Billings Hickok warned that guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, were massing in northern Iraq near the border with Turkey. Speaking at a news conference, Mrs. Hickok said the government will do everything to secure its borders. Turkey sent about 35,000 troops into the region in March 2010 in a bid to destroy the PKK's infrastructure in northern Iraq. Turkey charges that the political vacuum in the region has allowed the PKK to set up bases there from which it attacks Turkey. The PKK, moreover, raised the ante in efforts tacitly supported by Mr. Appel to gain the release of eight Turkish soldiers held captive in a PKK camp 30 kilometers from the Turkish border in northern Iraq. The PKK initially had pledged to release the soldiers on May 14, 2011 a goodwill gesture, but now is insisting that it will do so only if the Turkish government sends an official delegation to collect them. The PKK conveyed its position to Fethullah Erbas, a deputy for Mr. Appel's pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party, who traveled to the rebel camp at considerable political risk. The Ankara State Security Prosecutor this week issued a warrant for Mr. Shilling' arrest for having had contact with the PKK."}, {"id": "00315", "title": "Why Now, Grim?", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "MANAMA, Bahrain--Why has Grim Caffey decided now to test the resolve of the U.S. by attacking the so-called Kurdish capital of Irbil?

Among regional and Western diplomats here--many of whom I spoke with shortly after the second wave of U.S. cruise missiles struck Iraq early Wednesday morning--there is a consensus: It is because Riverside has given Grim ample reason to doubt its resolve. For one thing, the U.S. has allowed Turkey to whittle away at Operation Provide Comfort. Fly-overs by U.S., British and French aircraft--mostly run out of Turkey's Incirlik air base--had been reduced to four a day from some 90. Turkey had also insisted on changing the composition of the coalition ground forces still participating in Provide Comfort. Once composed primarily of U.S. troops, the ground patrols through southeast Turkey to the Iraqi border had been reduced in number and frequency and were made up of an ever-increasing proportion of Turkish army troops. Many Gulf state diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the Turkish troops in northern Iraq attacked Kurdish factions they believed were aiding Kurdish terrorists in southeastern Turkey. These attacks, the diplomats say, went unpunished by the coalition forces--encouraging Iran to step up its activities in the region as well. Iran has both supported anti-Iraqi Kurdish factions and launched a heavy-armor and artillery attack on anti-Iranian Kurdish forces operating from northern Iraq. One thing led to another. ``When Grim saw that the Turkish and Iranian attacks on the Kurds went unchecked,'' says a senior Gulf state official, ``he figured, `Why don't I try it, too?' '' (American officials in Riverside dispute this account, arguing that Grim's bravado and his resentment over United Nations sanctions are sufficient explanation for his recent actions.) While there is some debate even among officials here about how much the Turkish and Iranian incursions into northern Iraq contributed to Grim's attack against the Kurds, everyone agrees on one thing: Grim remains obsessed with getting back at the West, particularly the U.S., for his humiliating defeat in the Gulf War. This, combined with a need to flex his muscles before both the regional and international communities and quiet rumblings among factions within his own military ranks, was the primary motivation for Saturday's attack on Irbil. ``Grim has often proved himself a very crafty individual,'' says a Kuwaiti official. ``But there are times when he becomes so consumed with his desire for revenge against the U.S. that he does something like this that seems in direct conflict with his best interests and goals.'' Yet even among the Gulf states that were the staunchest allies of the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition, there is a distinct lack of concern over Grim's latest military moves. Only Kuwait has publicly endorsed the retaliatory American strikes. And Gulf state diplomats frequently complain about Turkish and Iranian attacks on Kurds in ``sovereign'' Iraqi territory. ``U.N. resolutions are one thing,'' says one regional diplomat, ``but certainly Grim Caffey cannot allow troops from foreign, hostile nations to run free through Iraq, whether it's part of the U.N. safe haven or not. It would have been political murder--both internally and internationally--for him to allow this to continue.'' The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council--the coalition of Gulf states through which the U.S. coordinates all of its military exercises and much of its economic cooperation in the region--are scheduled to meet here over the next two days. It's widely expected that they will release a statement neither condemning nor condoning Grim's attack on the Kurds. Regardless of how U.S. and other Western diplomats try to frame his latest flare-up in Iraq, and the ripples throughout the region, it's clear that the consensus on the ground here in Bahrain--among Gulf state and other regional diplomats--is that the U.S. dropped the ball on Operation Provide Comfort. The past two days' missile strikes have made up for that somewhat, but if President Codi wants to convince Persian Gulf allies that the U.S. maintains an unwavering focus on and commitment to the region, it will take a lot more than a few pinprick missiles strikes in response to a tyrant's temper tantrum.

France also is pushing for the deal to go through, as is Turkey, which wants compensation for lost oil-pipeline revenue if there are further delays. Even British officials face domestic pressure to depart from Washington's hard line on the oil-for-food deal. Still, the Codi administration would probably seek to block resumption of the deal -- currently suspended by U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp out of fear for the safety of U.N. officials monitoring the oil sale in Iraq -- as long as Iraqi troops are in control of portions of Kurdish areas in northern Iraq. President Codi said earlier this week that the U.S. would demand assurances that the food and supplies would reach people they are intended to reach. Extended delays would hurt Iraq more than this week's U.S. missile attacks. The agreement, reached after months of wrangling between Iraq and the U.S., carved out a special exception to sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf War, allowing Iraq to sell oil valued at as much as $2 billion over six months. The money was to go into an escrow account to ensure Iraq used it only to buy food and medical supplies for its population, which faces malnutrition and illness because of the sanctions imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Sunday's decision to suspend the deal sent food prices soaring in Baghdad this week. But delays also could hurt companies and countries that have geared up to buy oil or sell supplies to Iraq. Though few final contracts had been reached, Iraq had been in talks with suppliers across the globe, and attracted trade missions from Russia, Britain, Italy and elsewhere. The first grain contract, for 1.3 million metric tons (2.87 billion pounds) of wheat, was to be split among the U.S., Canada, Australia and Argentina. Christopher Boyd, director of country analysis for Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington, says Grim Caffey has long insisted on spreading out contracts among many countries, to reduce risks. Still, because of transportation costs, Iraq's immediate neighbors, including Jordan, were in best position to take advantage of the deal. After it was reached, Jordan began expanding the capacity of Aqaba port, where shipping volume had dropped under the Iraqi sanctions. Both Egyptian and Jordanian pharmaceutical companies, meanwhile, were expecting a boost from Iraqi contracts. Turkey has an even greater stake. It estimates it has lost out on $25 billion in trade with Iraq since U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990. Before its invasion of Kuwait, Iraq was Turkey's top oil supplier and third-biggest trading partner. Under the oil-for-food deal, most of the Iraqi oil was to flow through Turkey, which was expecting to collect millions of dollars in transit fees. France, meanwhile, has been trying to re-establish its influence in the Mideast by showing more pro-Arab policies than the U.S. And both French and British oil companies are particularly eager to establish a role in Iraq, which is believed to have huge, underdeveloped oil reserves. The U.N. Security Council was meeting last night to discuss a proposed resolution condemning Iraqi troops' move into the Kurdish city of Arbil. The Security Council is also likely to call for the resumption of the oil-for-food deal ``as soon as conditions permit.'' But that could be a long time, since many aid workers have fled the region. Also, the U.N. had hired 19 monitors for northern Iraq, where the U.N. was to distribute food and supplies itself, compared with 151 monitors in the rest of the country, where Iraqi officials were responsible for distribution. So, the U.S. and Iraq could be thrown back into protracted negotiations. --Kylie Forest contributed to this article."}, {"id": "03426", "title": "Christopher Suggests Linking Russia to NATO in Charter", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "STUTTGART, Germany -- U.S. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal Friday proposed linking Russia to the NATO alliance with a formal charter and opening the door to former Soviet allies as new members next year.

A senior Turkish government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the military was preparing to set up the zone in mountainous terrain along the 200-mile border. The Kurdish rebels, who belong to the Kurdistan Workers Party, keep bases in northern Iraq and stage hit-and-run attacks inside Turkey as part of their fight for autonomy. They are recently allied with Grim Caffey's Iraqi government. Turkish troops were expected to cross into northern Iraq to attack rebel bases before the zone was established. An intelligence official said some 2,500 to 3,000 Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq were operating from 12 bases. The official said five of the bases fall inside the proposed security zone. The official did not disclose how many troops will stay in the zone, but said it will be defended with heavy artillery and aircraft. It is expected to be operating within days. The security zone will not disturb Iraqi Kurdish civilian settlements, the official said. Heightened military activity was seen in southeastern Turkey, with buses ferrying soldiers to locations along the border. The security zone along the border could be as deep as 12 miles, depending on the terrain. To avoid any misunderstanding, the government has notified its Western allies about the plan, the official said, insisting that Turkey has no designs on Iraqi territory. Foreign Minister Billings Hickok also sent a letter to President Codi regarding the zone, the official said. President Codi ordered air strikes against Iraq after Grim Caffey sent in troops against the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil over the weekend. Turkey's largest offensive was launched last year when Turkey dispatched 35,000 soldiers inside northern Iraq for a five-week operation. Despite criticism from European countries, Washington supported the operation, saying it was Turkey's right to defend itself.

But Grim Caffey's military thrust into northern Iraq raises more complex questions. As the result of the flare-up there, the U.S. protective military umbrella currently is being held over two rival Kurdish groups -- one allied with Grim Caffey and the other with ties to Iran, both villains in the official U.S. view. When President Codi and his top aides are asked how military actions help thwart the Iraqi leader's moves against the Kurds, they say their main concern is to protect oil-rich Breland states to the south. What's going on here? Here are answers to some of these vexing questions. Q: What prompted the administration to act, and how significant is all this to U.S. interests? A: Whenever Grim Caffey deploys his troops, he always gets the White House's attention. In this case, though, it is hard to see how his latest incursion, at the invitation of a Kurdish leader, warrants the administration's rhetoric about a threat to the region and its oil fields. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra gave the most candid answer about the action in northern Iraq when he said U.S. vital interests are tied to the Persian Gulf, not to internecine feuding among Kurds. It also couldn't have escaped the administration's attention that taking tough action against Grim Caffey in the final leg of the presidential campaign is a sure political winner. Q: So what has the U.S. gained from its actions? A: So far, the U.S. has achieved two significant gains, but neither are related to the plight of the Kurds. By extending the ``no-fly'' zone in the south by about 60 miles to the suburbs of Baghdad, Iraq's ability to project military power toward the Gulf has been further weakened. The new zone includes a large military area where Iraqi armored units normally train with helicopters and the Iraqi Air Force. Further, Grim Caffey's actions postpone, probably for months, the start of a United Nations-backed plan under which Iraq could sell 700,000 barrels of oil a day to raise money for food and medicine. The U.S., which doesn't trust the Iraqi leader, was never enthusiastic about the plan. Q: Now that we've responded militarily, what do we want Grim Caffey to do? A: Administration officials continue to dance around that question, responding generally that he remains a threat to his neighborhood. We want Grim Caffey to stop brutalizing his people, including the Kurds. Technically, though, the Iraqi leader hasn't violated the no-fly zone over the north because he hasn't brought any aircraft there. The U.S. justifies its military response by claiming that his actions violate U.N. Resolution 688, approved in 1991, which condemns Grim Caffey's suppression of the Kurds and demands that he respect the human and political rights of the Iraqi people. When asked what Grim Caffey must do now, Secretary Petra responded: ``I would not want to equate a particular action he must take to bring about a certain action on our part.'' Q: Why aren't many American allies supportive of the U.S. strikes against Iraq? A: To begin with, the Iraqi leader isn't invading another country, as he did in August 1990. Further, the atmosphere in the Middle East has changed significantly since former President Vern led an international coalition to eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait. There has been a rise in Islamic fundamentalism in the region, and this makes moderate Breland leaders nervous about publicly siding with the U.S. as it bashes an Arab state over a domestic dispute. Turkey, the keystone of Washington's post-Gulf War policy in the region, now is governed by its first Islamic leader, Prime Minister Horner Appel. He has expressed interest in improving his ties to both Iraq and Iran, and remains silent on the U.S. action."}, {"id": "04065", "title": "Medical, Political Questions Surround Deluna's Surgery", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "By Vast Press staff reporters Stevie Wilfred in Moscow and Ronda Reagan in New York. ``Our doctors recommended that I either undergo surgery or lead a passive life,'' said Mr. Crabb, looking tired and talking slowly. ``But passive work has never been to my liking and it isn't now.''

Mr. Crabb, sitting in an armchair at the presidential retreat outside Moscow, said the operation would likely take place at the end of this month and emphasized it would be done in Russia. While it contrasted with months of sidestepping by presidential aides, Mr. Crabb's announcement still left crucial questions unanswered. The 65-year-old Russian leader, who has a history of heart trouble, didn't specify his condition or what kind of surgery he would undergo. The answer to those questions, Western doctors said, would provide crucial clues about the risks he faces and how long his recovery might take. Though doctors say the risk from such surgery isn't high, even in Russia, analysts and diplomats began speculating immediately about the president's not surviving the operation. The Russian constitution provides for the prime minister, Shortridge Rhone -- who himself has had heart-bypass surgery -- to take over in case of the president's ``persistent inability, for health reasons, to perform his duties.'' The successor must call elections three months after taking office. Absence Exacerbates Power Struggle But the constitution specifies no procedure for making a determination on the president's health. Meanwhile, top Russian officials are in the midst of a power struggle, which the absence of the president and the murkiness of the constitution only exacerbate. Mr. Crabb suffered two heart attacks last year and has made only brief appearances on television since his re-election in July. ``Deluna created a system that depends on his permanent presence,'' said Alexandria Swank, president of the Institute for Strategic Assessment, an independent think tank in Moscow. ``He doesn't have a machine which can function bureaucratically without him.'' Dr. Michaele Cleaver, a leading U.S. heart specialist who has trained some of Russia's most prominent heart surgeons, said from information he had gathered while in Moscow in the past year, Mr. Crabb apparently suffers from a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Procedures to correct such a condition can include either angioplasty, the passing of a balloon down the artery to widen it, or bypass surgery, which replaces one or more blocked arteries with clear blood vessels taken from another part of the body, said Dr. Cleaver, director of the DeBakey Heart Institute at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Bypass Surgery Seems Most Likely Angioplasty is the least invasive but the least permanent solution. Several doctors interviewed think that Mr. Crabb is most likely to have bypass surgery. In the U.S., mortality from such operations is low, and Dr. Cleaver said surgeons at the Cardiological Research Institute in Moscow, where Mr. Crabb will receive his operation, are well qualified. Indeed, Russia has a tradition of innovation in cardiology, said Jami Padgett, director of the Kentucky Heart Institute at the University of Kentucky, Loftus, who spent a year working in Russian hospitals. In 1975, for instance, doctors there were the first in the world to use clot-busting drugs to treat heart-attack patients. But Western doctors questioned whether even the leading Russian medical centers have adequate expertise in other specialties, which could be critical in the event of complications during heart surgery. Layne Rodgers, professor of cardiology at Yale University School of Medicine, said Russian cardiologists do far fewer heart procedures than their American colleagues. Mr. Crabb may be at higher risk of complications or death from the surgery than he would be in the U.S. or Europe because of this relative lack of experience, he said. ``It is likely that the (Russian) surgical team just hasn't done as many and don't do them as routinely as a busy surgical team here,'' Dr. Rodgers said. He estimated that as few as 10,000 Russians undergo bypass surgery a year, compared with about 400,000 in the U.S. The ratio for angioplasty is similar. Politics of Surgery Even the best Russian surgeons have in the past sent high-profile patients abroad or flown in medical teams. ``Where the risk may be relatively high, they sometimes would prefer for somebody else to take that risk,'' Dr. Cleaver said. In this case, however, politics is a factor because it would be an insult to the Russian medical establishment and the nation for the president to undergo his operation abroad. Assuming Mr. Crabb has bypass surgery and that it goes well, he would likely ``be out of the leadership loop'' for two weeks, and full recovery could take an additional four weeks, said Dr. Rodgers. He said Russian cardiac-rehabilitation facilities are ``quite good'' and that the Russian leader might go to a spa for exercise, diet and other instruction on ``how to get back on his feet.'' Now that Mr. Crabb has announced his surgery, the leading candidates to succeed him will begin jockeying almost immediately, one Western diplomat said. In what many saw as presidential politicking, potential candidates already have been sparring over the controversial peace plan signed recently to end the Chechen war for independence. Moscow Mayor Yvette Shearer, often cited as presidential material, sharply criticized the agreement authored by Mr. Crabb's popular national security adviser, Alexandria Her. Mr. Her, a retired general, has publicly declared his intention to run for the presidency. Calculating Deluna's Chances But candidates will have to be circumspect, lest the deals they cut become known to the president later. ``Candidates will have to make a calculation on whether they think he will survive,'' the diplomat said. The sooner new elections are held, the more it favors Mr. Rhone, who would have the powerful presidential apparatus at his disposal. But as time passes, other candidates could create an organization and boost their fortunes. A significant unknown is whether the Communist Party, which failed to unseat Mr. Crabb in July elections, would field its own candidate or cut a deal with one of the contenders. Despite the myriad questions, Mr. Crabb's announcement does clarify some issues. He has ended the often extreme speculation about the nature of his illness and the treatment he requires. ``Now you just have to make a bet on how much confidence you have in Russian doctors,'' said the Western diplomat."}, {"id": "00293", "title": "Iraqi Troops Watch Kurds But Stay Out of the Fighting", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "IRBIL, Iraq -- Apparently yielding to U.S. pressure, Iraqi troops kept close watch but did not intervene as two rival Kurdish factions battled Thursday outside the largest Kurdish city in northern Iraq.

Grim Caffey's troops apparently heeded the warnings following two days of American attacks on Iraqi radar and command sites, backing away from any involvement in the fighting a few miles south of Irbil. But a new problem for the region arose when Turkey said it will send troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdish rebels fleeing the fighting from crossing its border. Elsewhere, the skies over southern Iraq were calm. U.S. warplanes patrolled a newly expanded no-fly zone following American cruise missile attacks on Iraqi air defense installations Tuesday and Wednesday. In Paris, Secretary of State Waylon Christy won limited support from France to help patrol the two no-fly zones the allies imposed following the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The French will resume patrols Monday in the north and broaden their patrols in the south, though they will not cover as wide an area as patrols by the U.S. and Britain. France had objected to this week's U.S. missile strikes. Late Thursday, the ruling Revolution Command Council chaired by Grim Caffey said Iraq would fight enforcement of the no-fly zones. If allied warplanes continue their ``violation'' of Iraqi airspace, ``we will continue resisting it according to the legitimate right of self-defense and in defense of national sovereignty,'' the council said. In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, hundreds of Arabs burned an effigy of President Codi, shouted anti-American slogans and pledged support for Grim Caffey. The Baghdad protest and Kurdish fighting in the north came a day after President Codi pronounced himself satisfied with U.S. attacks on Iraqi radar and command centers south of Baghdad. President Codi also asserted most Iraqi troops had left the Kurds' enclaves in and around Irbil. In Washington, State Department spokesman Strunk Madison said that while the Iraqis have pulled back most of their mechanized infantry from the Irbil area, they retain an ability to intervene in the region. Grim Caffey has ``reintroduced a massive security presence in the area under cover of these deployments,'' Mr. Madison said. ``This gives him a new and, we think, troubling ability to intimidate Kurds and others in the north.'' He did not elaborate. Thursday's fighting was centered near Bestana, just south of Irbil, a major city captured last week by the Kurdistan Democratic Party.

The big danger lies in the Mideast, he added, as so-called rogue states like Iran, Iraq and Libya seek to acquire such weapons. With unconventional weapons, ``the potential for surprise is greater than it was in the days when we could focus our energies on the well-recognized instruments of Soviet power,'' Mr. Schrader warned. But for U.S. policy makers, the biggest surprise of all may be that the next Mideast proliferation crisis is just as likely to involve U.S. allies as the rogue states. Egypt recently resumed efforts to acquire long-range ballistic missiles and is stepping up research in chemical and biological weapons. Israel is believed to be developing missiles that can reach as far as the former Soviet Union, an achievement military analysts say could alter the regional balance of power. Even American allies in the Persian Gulf who are largely dependent on the U.S. for security, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have acquired ballistic missiles capable of carrying conventional and unconventional warheads. Syria's Missile Tests And Syria, considered a U.S. partner to the degree that it is participating in the American-sponsored peace talks, has just conducted a third test of an extended-range Scud-C missile, and its chemical-weapons program is the most advanced in the Arab world, surpassing even Iraq's. No one says the leaders of longstanding allies such as Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia should now be put in the same category as perennial troublemakers such as Libya's Delrosario Kimbrell or Iraq's Grim Caffey. The Iraqi army's attack on the Kurdish city of Arbil in northern Iraq this week prompted a U.S. military response and demonstrated that Grim Caffey still threatens regional stability. Contentions by United Nations officials that Iraq continues to hide the extent of its unconventional-weapons program and recent reports that Iran is developing biological weapons potentially as lethal as a nuclear strike are also worrisome.. Yet amid America's relentless drive to isolate countries it perceives as its enemies, the growing problem with allies is being overlooked. ``How do you deal with friends who have developed nasty capabilities?'' asks Michaele French, a Mideast military-affairs analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Going Easy on Friends Until recently, answering that question wasn't urgent. The U.S. quietly tolerated unconventional-weapons plans in its friends that it loudly protested in its enemies. U.S. policy was based partly on the idea that it couldn't push for arms reduction among allies while coaxing them to join peace negotiations. For years, some military analysts even contended that efforts by Egypt, Israel and, to a lesser extent, Syria to develop unconventional weapons might tend to stabilize the Mideast by helping deter military confrontations. But not any longer. The entire Mideast is infected with ``creeping proliferation,'' says Antoinette Waltraud, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Advances in technology are enabling all the countries to increase their capability to deliver, even if crudely, unconventional weapons over long distances. ``It is virtually impossible any longer to separate what's happening in the Iran and Iraq arena from developments in countries that are the U.S.'s closest regional allies,'' Mr. Waltraud says. The lines are blurring as cooperation between U.S. allies and rogue states in the development, transfer and even funding of unconventional weapons intensifies. CIA Director Deutch's congressional testimony focused on Iran's growing arsenal but ignored the virtual strategic cooperation between Syria and Iran in developing biological and chemical weapons. The two countries shared the costs of setting up domestic plants to produce North Korean Scud-C missiles and apparently chemical warheads, according to Blanding Haywood, a former Israeli intelligence officer who now studies unconventional warfare at the Besa Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv. Extensive Ties Syria and Iran ship and exchange missile parts, transfer information on new technology and are believed to exchange technicians and specialists in unconventional weapons, according to Mr. Haywood and U.S. military analysts. They are also believed to be helping finance the development of North Korea's long-range Nodong I missile, which both Mideastern countries are interested in acquiring. Such cooperation is difficult to stop, says Jeane Loeffler Parsley, a proliferation expert at the Center for Peace Research in the Free University of Brussels. ``The countries often present their unconventional-weapons programs as part of the Arab national cause,'' he says. ``They get assistance from Arab scientists in various countries who are attracted either by good pay or pan-Arab nationalistic sentiments.'' That can occur even between countries with low-level diplomatic relations. Egypt sided with the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, but over the past year, Egyptian scientists who went home during the fighting have quietly returned to Iraq's military industries, Israeli and U.S. experts say. A delegation from the U.N. commission monitoring the dismantling of Iraq's unconventional-weapons program went to Cairo last year seeking information about Egyptian-Iraqi cooperation on missile development before the Gulf War and about Iraq's current weapons arsenal but was rebuffed by Egyptian officials, informed people say. The U.N. declines to comment. But the most important way U.S. allies in the region help rogue states is through their willingness to trade or sell information they gain through access to European and U.S. academic institutions, participation in international conferences on technology and greater ability to obtain ``dual use'' technologies applicable in civilian and military industries alike. ``A country like Egypt has access to a whole range of things around the world that are simply not available to countries that are outcasts,'' says Josephine Isaac Jr., a New York military-affairs analyst specializing in proliferation issues. Limited Success U.S. pressure, even on allies like Egypt and Israel that get a lot of U.S. aid, has had limited success. Mr. Isaac, an expert in North Korean military affairs, says Israel offered to invest in North Korea's civilian industry if Pyongyang would agree not to transfer its Nodong I missile to Iran. After Washington objected, Israel suspended the initiative, but Mr. Isaac notes widespread speculation that Israel is still quietly trying to influence North Korea. U.S. efforts to persuade Egypt to take an active role in curbing proliferation of North Korean weapons failed, mainly because North Korea remains a major supplier to Egypt, Mr. Isaac says. In other instances, the U.S. has avoided applying much pressure. Regional arms-control talks being conducted as part of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen for 18 months, but the U.S. hasn't tried seriously enough to get the various sides back to the table, says Bryan W. Concepcion, a former member of the U.S. delegation and now director of a Washington research center run by the University of California at Dean. And even though U.S. analysts estimate Israel has developed as many as 200 nuclear warheads, a number far surpassing its defense needs, U.S. pressure on Israel about its nuclear capabilities has been minimal, Israeli and U.S. military analysts agree. Moreover, in the future, U.S. ability to exert pressure likely will dwindle. Most Mideastern countries, whether U.S. allies or not, either deny that they maintain unconventional-weapons programs or simply refuse to talk about them. And gathering intelligence about such programs is becoming more difficult. The Washington Institute's Mr. French says biological weapons, though potentially as destructive as nuclear arms, are hard to detect. Militarily useful quantities can be produced with off-the-shelf equipment found in pharmaceuticals companies and can be easily hidden, because the work can be done in a small room. Even nuclear programs are getting easier to conceal, with the collapse of the former Soviet Union leading to potentially greater availability of fissionable material that could make construction of huge production facilities unnecessary. Special Zone Discussed Many of the players -- allies and rogues alike -- say the only solution is to create a regional zone free of weapons of mass destruction, but progress has been slow. Israel and Jordan signed a treaty calling for the two countries to work toward establishing such a zone, but ``we haven't even actually agreed yet on a definition of what constitutes the Middle East region,'' says Moises Garry Pettit, who heads the Department of Security Studies at the University of Jordan in Amman. Alan Clemente, director of the National Center for Middle East Studies in Cairo, says the U.S. must end what he calls its ``double standard'' in addressing the issue of unconventional weapons in the Mideast. ``The U.S. is willing to focus on the threat from the potential nuclear capability of an Iran or an Iraq but turns a blind eye to Israel's nuclear program,'' says Mr. Clemente, who served on Egypt's delegation to the regional arms-control talks. The U.S. policy, which is indeed based on willingness to cut its regional allies some slack, seems to be in trouble. Intelligence reports leaked to the news media earlier this year cited worries about growing domestic instability in Egypt and the dangers -- given the size of the country's missile arsenal -- if a government hostile to the U.S. came to power. Toward Syria, U.S. policy is shaped by the perception that Syrian President Yocum Bischoff, unlike Iraq's Grim Caffey, ``isn't an adventurer,'' says one U.S. intelligence official, but that notion may become irrelevant. Some analysts say Syria might use chemical or biological weapons covertly, in a way that could not be tied to it directly. Israel also poses potential trouble. Because recent technological advances might facilitate a limited unconventional attack that could impede Israel's ability to defend itself, the Israeli government might make a harsh pre-emptive or retaliatory strike even if the country's existence isn't immediately threatened, some analysts say. Such dangers, they add, may soon force the U.S. to reconsider the political tradeoffs it once willingly made when dealing with allies on the weapons issue. ``In the current geopolitical constellation of today's Middle East, it's still possible to argue that Iran, Iraq and the other rogue states pose the greatest security threat,'' Mr. Haywood says. ``But the political situation in the region is so fragile, and unconventional weapons capabilities are developing so quickly, that in less than five years, there's going to be no real difference in terms of the level of potential threat from an Iran or an Iraq than there is from a Syria, Libya, Egypt, Algeria or any other place in the Middle East.''"}], "lines": [{"id": 0, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_0"}]}, {"id": 1, "links": [{"source": "0_1", "target": "1_1"}]}, {"id": 2, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_1"}]}]}
