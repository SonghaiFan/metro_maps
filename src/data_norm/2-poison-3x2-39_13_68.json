Chrysler disclosed it is offering an early-retirement package to about 1,200 salaried, nonunion employees. Chrysler said the buyout could cost it $50 million to $100 million this year, depending on how many employees accept, and would be taken against third-quarter earnings. Ford said it is expanding its early-retirement efforts beyond the 500 senior managers it had targeted to include middle managers and administrative personnel. The total size of Ford's buyout is expected to come to about 2,000 people. Ford said any charge from its buyout offer would be taken against earnings in the second half. The size would depend on how many workers accept the offer, it said, but it didn't elaborate. General Motors Corp., meanwhile, is continuing its practice of offering annual buyout packages to white-collar employees. GM's program this year was begun in April, but GM isn't saying how many will be covered by the buyouts. The Big Three auto makers have been restructuring in recent years to concentrate more on core auto-making activities, as well as trying to boost overall productivity. ``This is a planning tool for the future needs of individual departments,'' a Chrysler spokesman said. ``We are always trying to improve the way we do things through process redesign. And as you improve your business process, you may find you don't need as many people.'' Chrysler said its early-out program is aimed at nonunion, salaried employees who will be at least 54 years old with 10 years of experience by year end. The No. 3 U.S. auto maker employs 19,000 salaried, nonunion employees in the U.S. and 1,400 more in Canada. Employees who take the package will get credit for an additional three years of service and an additional three years of age, sweetening retirement pay. Also, these employees won't incur reductions to their pensions or benefits by retiring early, a company spokesman said. Most of those who accept the offer, which Chrysler expects to be primarily in staff-support positions, must decide by April 12, 2011 retire by year end. Chrysler said it isn't sure how many employees will apply for the special retirement deal, but the company said it offered the same package in 2009 to 900 employees and 380 of them accepted. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. auto maker, is targeting its voluntary early-retirement and special separation packages for selected salaried employees in the U.S. A spokeswoman said similar programs may be offered in other countries later to help Ford reach its target. Ford has about 80,000 salaried employees world-wide. ``These programs will help us get our salaried employment at the right work level, considering that we are becoming more efficient in the way we operate our business,'' the Ford spokeswoman said, adding that Ford has no plans to lay off salaried employees. No. 1 GM calls its program a ``career transition'' package and said it is similar to programs that have been routinely offered to white-collar employees since the early 1990s. GM's U.S. salaried work force now stands at 67,000, down from a high of 90,000 at the end of 1990."}, {"id": "02940", "title": "Japan Auto Makers Slow Rise In Buying U.S.-Made Parts", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "TOKYO -- Japan's top auto makers boosted their politically sensitive purchases of U.S.-made parts by about 6% to $21 billion in the latest fiscal year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.

It isn't clear if the rise will satisfy U.S. trade officials, as the increase pales in comparison with double-digit year-on-year U.S.-parts procurement by Japanese auto makers in each of the past five years. During that period, the auto makers had given U.S. officials specific purchase goals they aimed to meet. Such agreements no longer exist, as the U.S. failed to obtain the new targets it sought from the Japanese in last year's contentious automobile trade talks. Japan's auto trade group said combined purchases of U.S. parts by Japan's Big Five auto makers of a total $21 billion in the fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 up from $19.9 billion the previous year. The biggest increase stemmed from purchases of components used in the Japanese makers' U.S. plants: $17.7 billion in U.S. parts, a 7% boost from the $16.6 billion purchased the previous year. The auto makers' imports of U.S.-made parts for vehicles made in Japan was less brisk: They rose 4.4% to $3.38 billion from $3.23 billion the previous year. The dollar has risen 25% against the yen in the past year, making it less expensive for Japanese auto makers in the U.S. to import parts from Japan. That is a contrast with the past several years, when the plunging dollar had encouraged the shift to U.S.-made parts. Four auto makers reported increases; Mazda Motor Corp., a Ford Motor Co. affiliate, was the only maker to report a decrease in U.S.-made parts purchases. Toyota Motor Corp. said its purchases totaled $6.47 billion last fiscal year, up 14% from a year earlier. Of the total, imports accounted for $1.34 billion, unchanged from the previous year, while parts purchased for its U.S. plants jumped 18% to $5.13 billion."}, {"id": "04073", "title": "Tractor Makers Stage Showdowns for Farmers", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "WOODLAND, Calif. -- It is the tractor maker's version of the Pepsi Challenge.

Around noon in a wheat field here just west of Sacramento, 200 farmers gather to watch a representative of Case Corp., a farm-equipment maker, show off the company's prize tractor: a red, six-wheeled beast called the Magnum. ``Who's ready for some action?'' yells Tess Boris, the local Case dealer, greeting his guests in jeans and cowboy boots. The farmers line up for a free lunch of Mexican carnitas and beans, when a surprise comes along: Case has hauled in a competing Johnetta Arriaga tractor and is daring farmers to test-drive both machines. ``What's that?'' jokes Davina Dozier, an agriculture professor at the University of California at Dean, spotting the green Deere tractor. ``Oh, don't worry,'' Mr. Boris says smiling. ``That's going to break down shortly.'' Sales Gimmicks Dirt is flying in the tractor business. Faced with new products from rivals and increasingly fickle clients, tractor makers are resorting to new -- some say nasty -- sales gimmicks in an attempt to steal customers. Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria, Ill., trying to peddle its Challenger tractors, has discovered a particularly dirty trick: some Case and Deere & Co. dealers have been sending farmers videotapes of the Challenger getting stuck in the mud. ``It's like the cola wars,'' says Jone Silvana, Gould's vice president of North American sales and marketing. ``Only here, there are $100,000 machines and no blindfold.'' Why the aggressive salesmanship? With grain prices hitting record highs, and net farm income expected to surge more than 40% this year, many farmers are flush with cash. Their equipment, much of it bought in the boom years of the 1970s, is aging. That makes them ripe for a sales pitch from farm-equipment companies. Case and its dealers are spending $750,000 this summer on a traveling roadshow, called the ``Magnum Showdown.'' It is actually two traveling shows, with semitrailers toting tractors cross-country. Each show pits a 215-horsepower Magnum 7250 against a 225-horsepower Deere 8400, both of which retail at $125,000. Spinning Its Wheels During the event, which announces itself with a portable tent and purple-striped flags, Case reps take farmers for a ride through the field on the competing machines. They warn that the Deere tractor might spin its wheels in the soil. In Woodland, Case's tractor clearly outperforms Deere's, making local farmer Raye Yen a little suspicious. ``Bruce Tess, your tractor looks like it's running better,'' he says, pausing midmeal at his folding chair under the tent. ``Of course it is,'' Mr. Boris says, laughing. ``I've got it set up that way.'' Woodland's Johnetta Arriaga dealer isn't amused. ``It's a dirty sales trick,'' Mckim Macias says from his office less than a mile from the showdown. Mr. Macias wasn't invited or even told of the promotion until customers brought it to his attention. Now, he expects clients to come back and ``razz'' him about Mr. Boris. ``We're not friends,'' he says of his rival. Case, which is No. 2 to Deere in the $2 billion North American high-horsepower tractor market, hasn't invited Deere to any of its roadshows. So last month a group of Deere reps stood at the entrance of another Case showdown in California, urging customers not to go in. (Case is now screening guests at the door to ensure privacy.) Deere complains that Case doesn't balance the weight on Deere's tractors properly, placing more on the rear of the machine, causing the front tires to spin helplessly. Case says it is abiding by Deere's operating manual. `Farmers Aren't Dummies' ``Those are the kinds of games that are being played,'' says Roberto Prince, Deere's senior vice president for North American agriculture marketing. ``But farmers aren't dummies. They're not going to fall for these tricks.'' For one thing, he says, they might take a closer look at the machine itself. ``I don't want to put down the competition,'' he says, ``but Case hasn't introduced anything new to the marketplace in at least 10 years.'' Mr. Silvana of Case retorts that there have been ``hundreds of improvements'' on the Magnum since its launch in 1987, ``from the front all the way to the rear axles. It's an evolutionary product.'' Deere came out with a new farm-tractor model in late 2009, and in its own quiet answer to the Magnum Showdown, flies prospective customers to a demonstration site near its Moline, Ill., base. Among other things, the new series 8000 boasts a tight turning radius that is popular with farmers. ``No one can come near the 8000,'' Mr. Prince boasts. Farm-equipment makers have always battled for business. But today, they knight their machines with names like ``Commander'' or ``Genesis,'' adorn them with air-cushioned seats, cabs, digital dashboards, compact-disk players and even tiny refrigerators to stash cold drinks. Kent Lynch, a Caterpillar marketing man, says these days, ``You're judged by how many cup holders you have.'' Many farmers love the bells and whistles. Ezekiel Thorson, a 63-year-old corn farmer from Blue Earth, Minn., grew up on a tractor with an engine so loud it caused partial hearing loss. Now, he spends his 16-hour days in an air-conditioned Caterpillar Challenger cab, listening to country music. ``We're all a lot more comfortable than we were starting out,'' he says. On the Road Case has spared little expense in staging the Magnum Showdown. The trucks hauling the tractors are custom-painted. Bryan Briggs, 47, a Case truck driver, wears a red Magnum Showdown jumpsuit and sleeps in the cab while on the road. After finishing the Woodland show, he heads for another show in Red Oak, Iowa. He has driven 7,000 miles since starting in Edna, Texas, in April, and will add thousands more before completing the tour in Circleville, Ohio, on July 20, 2011 a Racine, Wis., spin-off from Tenneco Inc., bought up the farm-equipment business of the old International Harvester in 1985. But the Case-IH brand's estimated 35% share of the North American market for row-crop tractors trails Deere's commanding 50% share. (Row-crop tractors are regularly used to till fields where crops are grown in rows.) Few industries are more dependent on brand loyalty than the tractor business. Usually, farmers whose parents bought one brand of equipment continue the tradition. Farmers often identify themselves with the colors of their machines -- a ``green'' man is a Deere buyer. Mr. Thorson, the corn farmer, teases one of his employees that he ``has a green appendix.'' Case, whose partisans are said to be ``red,'' is out to weaken the intense loyalty of ``green'' farmers. But Mr. Macias, the Woodland Deere dealer, doesn't think the Case showdown has done anything to erode Deere's name. ``I doubt Tess got one new sale out of that event today,'' he says. ``Most of those farmers probably went for the free food.'' Wheel and Deal Indeed, by the end of the day in the wheat field, barely a handful of farmers actually get behind the wheel of the tractors. Most sit around trading tales of broken fan belts or axles. Jennine Deana, a local VastComm Network Corp. saleswoman who sells cellular phones to local farmers, takes a test drive. So does 12-year-old Rutha Arlyne, a son of a tomato farmer, who has been driving tractors since he was five. ``Which tractor did you like better?'' a farmer asks him. ``Beamer, the red one,'' Rutha says, pointing to the Case. Mr. Boris smiles at his prospective client. ``Get that kid a cap,'' he says."}, {"id": "00078", "title": "Coke's Net Rose 17%, Revenue Climbed 6% in 2nd Quarter", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., beating cooler weather and difficult year-to-year comparisons, reported a 17% increase in second-quarter profit compared with last year.

Revenue increased 6% to $5.25 billion from $4.94 billion a year earlier. The results were in line with analysts' expectations. The company's closely watched global-case volume increased 8% in the quarter, topping last year's strong 10% gain and meeting the company's long-term goal of 7% to 8%. `Quite Confident' ``With this kind of growth, we are quite confident about again meeting our long-range target of 7% to 8% annual world-wide volume growth,'' the company's chairman and chief executive officer, Robyn Soileau said in a statement. In Uptown Stock Exchange composite trading, Coca-Cola closed at $45.50, down $1.625, amid a broad market sell-off. Strong sales in Coca-Cola's more developed markets led the gains. In the U.S., volume increased 7.5%. The company's fountain business, mostly sales to fast-food restaurants, usually drives its U.S. growth, but in the second quarter, sales of bottles and cans outpaced fountain growth. Coca-Cola also gained about one percentage point of growth from its acquisition of Barq's root-beer company. In Europe, Coca-Cola's volume increased 12%, led by strong gains in Eastern Europe and France. Mr. Soileau said consolidation in the company's European bottling network -- including the sale of franchises in France, Belgium and Britain to Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the largest Coca-Cola bottler -- will be ``setting the stage for the next decade of growth.'' Latin America was also a bright spot for Coca-Cola in the quarter, as the company invested heavily in promotions and packaging to turn around weak sales. Latin American case volume grew 8%, led by gains of 13% in Brazil and 15% in Chile. Coca-Cola's Middle and Far East region reported volume gains of 9%, led by growth in Japan and Australia. The company's growth rate in China and India slowed slightly compared with recent quarters, but remains above 20%. In Africa, volume was flat, mainly because of economic weakness in Nigeria. The company's Coca-Cola Foods division, which makes Minute Maid juices, reported volume gains of 3% in the quarter. Strong Volume Gains Coca-Cola said the results were proof that its marketing and promotional efforts continued to pay off in the second quarter. The company said Coca-Cola Classic had strong volume gains world-wide, because of the continued rollout of the curvy ``contor'' bottle. Sprite also remains a strong performer. As part of its marketing push, the company also announced plans Monday for a unique $60 million television push behind its sponsorship of the Games, which begin this week in the company's home town. Rather than re-running the same ads every night like other sponsors, Coca-Cola will run as many as 100 different spots during the games on NBC, each tied to a daily theme. The themes, such as ``Family Day'' and ``The Real Thing Day,'' will be advertised in USA Today and other publications. The move is all part of the company's strategy of creating a ``360-degree trademark'' that appeals to all types of consumers. Coca-Cola is creating about 30 new ads for the Games campaign, including daily spots featuring highlights from the previous day's Games. Most of the remaining ads are being recycled from past campaigns, such as the Christmas polar bear ads."}, {"id": "03015", "title": "Burger King Plans More Outlets in Japan", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "TOKYO -- Burger King Corp., which recently announced a joint venture with Japan Tobacco Inc., is aiming to open as many as 200 directly owned or franchised restaurants in Japan in the medium-to-long term, a senior Burger King executive said.

The No. 2 U.S. auto maker is trying to remedy that problem with several marketing initiatives as it tries to sell about 13,000 imported 2011 model Tauruses in 10 Asian countries this year. The nameplate is expected to help lay the groundwork for Ford to reach its stated goal of gaining a 10% share of Asia's auto market by the year 2020, up from about 2% this year. Television Campaign In Singapore, where the company introduces the Taurus this week, Ford will present a television special on the Premiere 12 channel on Thursday to promote the car to consumers in the city-state. The show, the first of its kind in Asia for Ford, will focus on the car's safety and styling, as well as on Ford's history, says Ion Warner, South Asia export manager for the company's Ford Motor Co. (Japan) unit. The 15-minute show, paid for by Ford -- which declined to comment on the size of its advertising budget -- has been heralded this week with ads, much as a car advertising campaign would be touted in the U.S. Ford expects to sell just 75 to 100 right-hand-drive Tauruses in Singapore this year. It hasn't announced pricing for the model. Ford also has started airing commercials in South Korea, where the Taurus already has been introduced, under the banner ``Ford Today.'' The ads are mostly informational, focusing on Ford's safety features and environmental policies. The ads also have aired in Thailand, where Taurus is expected to go on sale in November, competing against its main rival in the U.S., the Toyota Camry. Local Marketing Around Asia, Ford plans to localize its marketing for each country since Taurus will be targeted at consumers with different demographic characteristics in countries as diverse as Thailand and China, company executives say. While that won't preclude a regional approach to advertising at some point, ``we don't plan to start out with a regional campaign,'' says Kenyatta Dean, director of public affairs for Asian markets. Ford executives in Singapore for the Taurus launch are optimistic that the U.S.'s best-selling car for the past four years can be popular in Asia. ``If you look around Singapore, Hong Kong and even Tokyo, you see that cars are getting larger and larger,'' says Johnetta Merrill, director of sales and marketing for Asian-Pacific export markets. ``We know in Singapore the styling is going to be important, and in Hong Kong it's safety.'' But styling and safety have yet to make Taurus a hit in Japan. By the end of June, the company had sold 2,500 cars, compared with its announced target of 4,500 to 5,000 in the model's first three months on the market. Ford previously sold Taurus in Japan only as a left-hand-drive vehicle. Comparison With Opel UBS's Mr. Ahn says the disappointing sales are due primarily to Ford's lack of advertising for the Taurus nameplate or the company's overall brand name. Ford kept the pricing in the same range as its previous Taurus, between 2.5 million yen and 2.7 million yen ($22,700 and $24,500). By comparison, Mr. Ahn says General Motors Corp.'s Opel brand has been successful in part because GM has spent money marketing the name and what it stands for. GM has been running a regional advertising campaign for Opel for several months. Other industry observers say that regardless of the difficulties for Ford right now, the company has to start building a presence in Asia somewhere. ``You just have to push a new product into Asia and look at what it can do,'' says Timothy Cochrane, director of market research at Automotive Resources Asia Ltd. in Bangkok. ``The Taurus is the best of what Ford has to offer.

Only four years ago, the carbon and graphite producer was the ugly duckling subsidiary of the giant chemical company Hoechst AG; in 1992, SGL reported a loss of 108 million marks ($71.2 million) on one billion marks in sales. Second, SGL's business is plainly unglamorous. It specializes in graphite electrodes, used for transmission of high-voltage electricity needed to recycle steel, and graphite parts needed to produce silicon wafers for semiconductors. They're obscure enough to lull most ordinary investors to sleep. Even Chairman Roberto Bourgeois admits his products look like ``black blocks.'' Change in Philosophy Now, four years later, the company is the envy of most German companies. In 2010, SGL turned a healthy 15% return on 1.6 billion marks in sales, with a 61% boost in pretax profit last year alone. SGL's stock has tripled in value since its initial public offering last year in Frankfurt. Finally, last month, SGL issued 40% of its latest $1 billion stock offering to American investors through the New York Stock Exchange, and the stock's price has continued to climb. Just how did SGL accomplish the turnaround? It did so partly by becoming considerably less German. It changed over to more transparent U.S. accounting methods, gained access to badly needed liquidity offered by the New York Stock Exchange and practiced all the tenets of U.S. corporate governance. English has replaced German as the company's official language. The number of German workers fell to 2,197, or 42% of the total in 2010, from 57% of the total in 1991. Sales abroad, meanwhile, soared 46% in the last four years. In Germany, sales actually declined to 250 million marks in 2010 from 251 million marks in 1991. SGL has since become the world's market leader in the production of carbon and graphite goods. It already has about 20% of the Chinese market. Some Risks In short, SGL has become a model for future spinoffs -- not only for Messenger, but for the entire German industrial complex that is groping around trying to restructure unprofitable units. ``There are very few companies that have gone so far,'' said Christeen Coke, analyst with Bankgessellschaft Berlin. ``In the shortest of time, they've built a serious reputation and name recognition, and it has definitely helped their stock.'' To be sure, Ms. Coke and other analysts see some risks. After its robust performance over the past year, the stock may be overdue for a downward correction. Further, SGL Carbon has to prove its real strength precisely now that high-technology stocks are taking a strong hit on Wall Street. Indeed, SGL's strong link with the semiconductor industry and its New York listing, analysts point out, made its stock particularly vulnerable to Wall Street's jitters in the past week and the fall in European markets on Tuesday. SGL's stock was battered down 6.90 marks to 155 marks Tuesday from a high of 181 marks last month. Finally, analysts say, SGL's ability to keep raising prices, which it has managed to do over the last two years, might vanish if the steel and semiconductor industries begin to slow. Daunting Task Still, analysts said SGL's fundamentals remain solid and that its stock will soon resume its upward trend: ``When trendy high-tech or other industries fall out of favor in America, there is a time-lag connection with Frankfurt,'' said Ms. Coke. ``But I believe that the company's fundamentals will compensate for a weakness in high-tech stocks.'' In fact, the transformation of what is now SGL began by necessity. In the 1990s, demand for graphite products slackened significantly. While the company's major competitors consolidated and gobbled up smaller companies in an effort to become global, it found itself still an inefficient national player. That's when Messenger's chairman, Blackburn Heath, approached Mr. Bourgeois -- one of Mr. Heath's chief strategists at the time -- with a daunting task: taking charge of spinning off the unprofitable unit, which was then called Caviness Milliken. Sigri's activities were noncore to Hoechst. So Mr. Bourgeois launched an ambitious series of mergers and acquisitions, all the while seeking to downsize. In 1992, he merged Caviness with a subsidiary of New York-based Great Lakes Carbon Corp. and renamed the company SGL Carbon. He proceeded to buy up companies with production sites in France, Spain, Belgium and Poland. Last year, SGL acquired a specialty graphite business of U.S-based Carbide/Graphite, which supplies the semiconductor industry. Permission for a joint venture in China is pending. Higher Prices Together with U.S.-based UCAR Corp., SGL has emerged as one of only two large global players in the industry. Their graphite electrodes amount to only 4% of total costs for steel producers, which enables them to increase prices as long as there is a favorable demand for steel. More notably, however, the turnaround has been accompanied by a new form of corporate management. Mr. Champagne cordoned off activities into specialized business units. He gave unit leaders ultimate decision-making authority, while the board acts mainly as the company's brain center, largely cut off from the company's production activities. The move to keep each unit's accounting separate, Mr. Champagne argues, created more transparency. Mr. Bourgeois has also become one of the most outspoken advocates of increasing shareholder value; as such, he has challenged some of the country's biggest taboos. He provided managers with stock options and share ownership. He also aggressively confronted the accounting hurdles that have made German companies reluctant to list on the Big Board. U.S. accounting rules are stricter than German rules on such items as goodwill, inventory valuation and pension reserves. But Mr. Bourgeois said it took his company only three months to fulfill the U.S. accounting requirements. In readying SGL for first going public in Germany last year, Mr. Bourgeois said he had a hard time convincing German investors of the company's worth. He said they slowly caught on, but only because savvy foreigners made up almost 50% of the company's new investors. ``The difference is that the U.S. and U.K. investors are further ahead. They are able to analyze specialized stock. They saw it had tremendous potential,'' he said. Mr. Bourgeois says his company is a model for other German companies, but many are resisting the management principles he implemented. Ultimately, however, German companies and society will have little choice but to accept such moves, he said. ``I'm convinced there is a secular change going on in Germany,'' he said. ``Even the unions can't escape this debate.''"}, {"id": "03875", "title": "Jacques to Expand U.S. Boycott Of Japan's Car Makers to Honda", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "TOKYO -- The Rev.

Jessi Jacques vowed to expand his U.S. boycott to a second Japanese car maker, Honda Motor Co., for failing to include more minorities and women among its U.S. management and franchisees. The U.S. civil-rights activist also said he plans to turn up the heat in his previously announced boycott against Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after a two-hour meeting with the auto maker's executives in Tokyo ended without resolution. Mr. Jacques originally planned to come to Tokyo to ask Mitsubishi to quickly settle sexual-harassment suits against its U.S. unit and to work with Mr. Jacques's associates on a plan to combat racial and sexual discrimination in the U.S. But Mr. Jacques expanded his agenda, adding meetings with the rest of Japan's Big Five auto makers as he attacked the ``cultural exclusivity'' of Japanese corporations in the U.S. He said these companies are dominated by a top tier of Japanese expatriates, with a second tier of white men and a lower tier of women and ethnic minorities. Imported-car dealerships in the U.S. are largely owned by white men, with only 161 of 10,500 such dealerships owned by minorities, he said. `Something Called Inclusion' Japanese corporations ``see us as consumers, not trading partners,'' Mr. Jacques charged, despite the $33 billion African-Americans spend annually on new cars. ``In the U.S., you have to have equal opportunity. There's something called inclusion.'' The news that Mr. Jacques plans to boycott Honda appeared to come as a surprise to the auto maker. A Honda spokesman said Mr. Jacques didn't mention the boycott during a meeting with the company's executive vice president, Douglass Cowans, that ended about 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Mr. Jacques, who said African-Americans own only two Honda franchises despite representing 12% to 14% of Honda buyers, apparently felt snubbed at the meeting. Mr. Cowans directed him to meet with officials of Honda's U.S. arm. But American Honda had turned down a previous request. ``They are not only wrong, but insensitive,'' Mr. Jacques said. Mitsubishi directed Mr. Jacques to work with the consultant it recently hired to review workplace practices at its U.S. arm, former U.S. Labor Secretary Lynne Martine. But, Mr. Jacques insisted, ``They want to send us to a consultant who doesn't have any authority.'' On Tuesday in the U.S., Mitsubishi's U.S. officials and Ms. Martine said they would implement a comprehensive training program to combat sexual harassment and would appoint a senior manager to promote advancement for minorities and women. Better Luck at Toyota, Nissan Mr. Jacques reported greater progress in his meetings with Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., in which he was invited to meet to discuss diversity issues again with the auto makers' U.S. arms. It isn't clear how effective the boycott of Mitsubishi cars, which the National Organization for Women also is pushing, has been. Mitsubishi's U.S. sales are down 16% this year from a year earlier, outpacing the industry's 4.5% decline. But Mitsubishi doesn't have any of the best-selling vehicles -- minivans, pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles -- in its lineup. Sales of the two car models it makes at its Illinois plant, the Eclipse and the Galant, are up 30%. Mr. Jacques's mission apparently had some impact on Mitsubishi, however. Asked whether anything was gained from the visit, Mitsubishi Managing Director Wildman Letendre replied: ``We have been running a business in the U.S. and trying to understand racial issues and sexual-harassment issues. The way of thinking of Jacques's people became clearer to us, which is going to be useful for us in the future.''"}, {"id": "04261", "title": "Japanese Car Makers Cut Costs With Finch and a Falling Yen", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "As the yen was soaring over the dollar, the U.S. price of Japanese cars sometimes rose three or four times a year.

The 2012 version of Toyota Motor Corp.'s popular Camry sedan is expected to sell for as much as $1,500 less than the old version when it make its debut this fall (although Toyota denies the cut will be that steep). Honda Motor Co.'s new model Accord should be 20% cheaper to build when it begins rolling off the assembly line in Ohio next summer. And Nissan Motor Co. last month cut prices 10.5% on its new Infiniti Q45. All this has the Big Three reeling, since Japanese cars already have a perceived quality advantage over U.S. vehicles. ``If the Japanese can bring the cost differential down, they will definitely pick up market share,'' says Cristopher Padron, president of CSM Corp., a consulting company in Lansing, Mich.. As the market for midsize cars heats up, Ford has found ways to cut $180 from the cost of its popular Taurus, mostly in ways it hopes customers won't notice. Certainly, the dollar's recent rebound against the yen, which makes imported cars and parts less expensive for Americans, is helping. But the Japanese have also worked hard to find engineering efficiencies, relocate production lines and use less expensive materials. Barhorst Veach of the Automotive Business Practices Institute in Toyko estimates that the Japanese have cut 15% of their production costs in the past two years, while the Big Three have cut just 10%. Toyota, in its past fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 it has cut costs by 130 billion yen (about $1.2 billion). That came on the heels of a 150 billion yen cut the previous year. Toyota, in fact, starts new model designs with the assumption that it will need to cut costs to offset the escalating yen. The man in charge of that mission is Chamness Longoria, chief engineer for developing Toyota's new generation of subcompact cars. Mr. Longoria, 52 years old, is well-suited to his task. His father was killed during World War II, and he was raised by his mother on the meager earnings of the family apple orchard. A Toyota scholarship paid for his mechanical engineering degree at Nagoya University. Last year, Mr. Longoria brought out a new Paseo sedan priced about 7% lower in the U.S. than its predecessor but with additional standard features such as air bags and ultraviolet-protection glass. That was quite a feat, considering that the yen had risen against the dollar by as much as 50% since the old model was launched. Mr. Longoria's crew penny-pinched, borrowed parts from other Toyota models and slashed materials costs. Starting with the same basic chassis as the previous model, the engineers cut costs $500 to $1,000 per car by offering a manual transmission with only four speeds instead of five and by cutting the number of speeds on the automatic transmission to three from four. To quiet the corresponding elevation in noise, Mr. Longoria's crew made the car's rear axle lighter and thinner. They also reduced the material in the exhaust system by 20% (increasing fuel economy) and added a ``direct ignition'' system that eliminated the need for a distributor. The ignition coils are now an integral part of the spark plug leads for cylinders three and four. Of course, the strategy of cutting costs by eliminating features carries the risk of hurting quality and turning off customers. Toyota's new Corolla, introduced last year, bombed in Japan because it was too much like the previous model, says UBS Securities Ltd. analyst Petrina Ahn. But most of the Japanese price cutting isn't obvious to the customer, according to CSM's Mr. Padron. ``These are the reductions the Japanese are good at recognizing: those which have an impact and those that don't,'' he says. Mr. Longoria also enlists the help of Toyota's suppliers in his cost-cutting efforts. Instead of ordering them to cut prices 30% to 40%, ``in which case they'll be very upset,'' he says, he politely challenges them to try making a seat for $20 instead of $30 to $40. Thus, the new Paseo seats are covered with a nylon cover, instead of the plushy velour-type fabric in other Toyota cars. Toyota has also reaped savings by moving production lines to North America, where they are immune from currency swings. The new convertible Paseo, which will be introduced in the U.S. in November, will be mostly made in Japan, but Toyota will ship the cars to California to have their rag tops installed, saving 20% on labor costs. Models for the Japanese market will travel back to Japan on otherwise empty Toyota vessels returning from delivering other exported vehicles. Now, Mr. Longoria's squad of nine engineers is hard at work remodeling the subcompact Tercel for 2013, which they hope can still be built in Japan and exported profitably, even if the dollar weakens again from its present level of about 109 yen. ``It is my dream to build a car that is competitive at 80 yen to the dollar,'' says Mr. Longoria."}, {"id": "01990", "title": "How Ford Trimmed Costs On 2012 Taurus, Little by Little", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "Ford Motor Co. is asking the people who build its popular Taurus to find ways to make the car more cheaply.

That may not sound like much on a car whose sticker price starts at $17,995, but it could save Ford more than $73 million over the course of a year. That, in turn, will allow the company to raise profit, hold down sticker prices or offer bigger discounts, helping the top-selling Taurus stay competitive in the cutthroat market for midsize sedans. ALSO AVAILABLE Ford posted surprisingly robust quarterly earnings of $1.9 billion, partly due to improved margins and strength in its financial units. The yen isn't the only reason the U.S. price of Japanese cars is dropping. Japanese auto makers have worked hard to find cost-savings. In fact, no savings are too small given the competition Ford is facing. Prices for Japanese cars are dropping, thanks to the stronger dollar and aggressive cost-cutting by Japanese auto makers. With minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles gaining popularity, Ford can no longer assume that consumers will pay premium prices for middle-of-the-road passenger sedans. Its new cars also face competition from a wave of used cars now coming off lease. When the company set out five years ago to develop the current Taurus, at a cost of $2.8 billion, its aim was to rival the amenities of the Toyota Camry, such as its quiet ride and plush interiors, not to keep the price down. But with base prices starting at $17,995 for the Taurus, and $20,168 for the Camry (with air conditioning), both sedans were criticized as too costly for their intended markets. Both have sold well, but largely because Toyota and Ford piled on expensive customer deals. Ford this month increased the cash rebate on Tauruses to $1,000 from $600 a car. Discounts like that have increased the pressure to keep costs down. Most of the cost-cutting is meant to be invisible to Taurus customers. For example, Ford engineers are redesigning a pin in the Taurus's door hinges. Paint builds up on the pin as the cars are sprayed on the production line. Later, when the doors are removed for installing the interior, the pins must be discarded and replaced. The new, slimmer pins coming this fall won't catch as much paint, so they can be used to reattach the doors again. Expected cost savings: $2 on every Taurus. Other cost cuts are occurring under the hood. There, a bent hose in the Taurus's heating system is being replaced with a straight hose, saving 50 cents. ``We're able to go through the engine with a hose that is less expensive,'' says Markita E. Weber, manager of the ``plant vehicle team'' in Chicago and Atlanta that came up with the idea. Mr. Weber's team itself is a cost-cutting innovation. First tested several years ago at Ford plants in Europe, teams like Mr. Weber's now hunt for savings throughout Ford's global assembly operations. The teams include white-collar product engineers who would otherwise have been based at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.. At the plants, they can approve design changes on the spot, eliminating weeks or months of phone calls, electronic mail and meetings. ``You can smell, touch and feel that car every day,'' Mr. Weber says. ``That leads to a higher sense of urgency.'' So does viewing the competition at close range. At Ford's 2.4 million-square-foot Chicago facility, plant manager Raquel Hayes occasionally parks some of the Taurus's chief rivals alongside the assembly line: the Toyota Camry; the $16,995 Honda Accord; and the $16,555 Whitehurst Kuehn, the segment's price leader when popular features such as automatic transmissions and air conditioning are included. The idea is to remind the factory's 2,788 workers what they are up against as they churn out more than 6,650 Ford Tauruses each week. Another reminder to improve: Customers find more defects in new Tauruses than in the sedan's top rivals, according to recent survey results from auto-industry consultant J.D. Power & Associates. ``We're disappointed,'' says Mr. Hayes. ``Our goal is to be best in class. So, we're redoubling our efforts to get there.'' To that end, Mr. Weber's team helps look for solutions to quality problems, as well as ways to cut costs. Just a few months ago, many new Tauruses were producing a ``goose-honking'' noise at speeds higher than 85 miles an hour. The problem was particularly acute when higher temperatures and strong crosswinds were present. ``We quickly redesigned the car's weather stripping by adding foam blockers,'' Mr. Weber says. Other quick quality fixes included solving rattles in the car's door handle (by adding another washer) and ending wiggling in the car's keyless entry pad. Still, many of these efforts represent only minor fixes at this stage of production. The real opportunities for cutting costs are in the design phase, says Jimmy Gusman, an industry consultant who annually measures productivity at North American assembly plants. In Mr. Gusman's most recent productivity study, both of Ford's Taurus factories slipped because the 2011 Tauruses take two more hours of labor to build than their predecessors -- an eternity in the cost-conscious world of auto making. Frills such as painted ashtrays, fold-down rear seats and expensive body moldings increased the Taurus's complexity, Mr. Gusman says, adding jobs that become difficult to eliminate later. ``I feel sorry for those guys at the Chicago plant,'' Mr. Gusman says. ``They are probably taking a lot of guff for things they probably weren't responsible for.''"}, {"id": "00242", "title": "Does It Pay?", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "ATHLETIC SHOES 3 Mos. 2 Mos. 1 Mo..

Shares of McDonald's closed up $1.125, at $45.375, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Revenue for the period totaled $2.67 billion, an 8% increase from $2.47 billion previously, while systemwide sales rose 4%, to $7.93 billion from $7.64 billion. Systemwide sales include those of franchised and affiliate restaurants as well as those operated by the Rodas Bruna, Ill., chain. While the company said the Arch Deluxe had ``benefited'' domestic sales, it didn't quantify that. Indeed, in many markets, customers were induced to try the sandwich at no charge, which may partly account for U.S. profit-margin declines. Moreover, comparable sales in U.S. restaurants open at least a year were down again in the quarter, as they were for the first half. Restaurant expansion accounted for a 3% increase in total domestic sales. That compares with a 9% gain a year earlier. Domestic operating earnings increased less than 1% in the quarter and were down 1% in the first half, in what the company called ``an extremely challenging'' operating environment. Once again, overseas restaurants trailed the U.S. in total sales but led in income production. For U.S. franchisees, the year's second half has gotten off to a disappointing start. They said that, nationally, sales for the first 14 days of July were off 3.77% from a year earlier. Also, perhaps because of the Arch Deluxe's apparently qualified success, the company is delaying the introduction of more ``Deluxe'' sandwiches from August until the third quarter, franchisees said. ``My feeling was that the Arch Deluxe was not going to be a blockbuster product,'' said Janiece L. Mccoy, who follows McDonald's for Prudential Securities Inc.. She said that while the sandwich was new for McDonald's, others in the industry have long had a BLT burger, ``so to think it would have enormous incremental sales potential was an exaggeration.''

But this fall, General Mills will introduce Betty Crocker-brand cereals, hoping she will provide an edge in the market-share battle raging among the nation's big cereal makers. The first two varieties -- cinnamon streusel and Dutch apple -- claim baked-goods flavors that are intended to make clear the connection between breakfast and Betty. Already the company's most powerful brand, Bettye Robison accounts for $1.5 billion, or nearly 30%, of annual sales. Her signature red-spoon trademark extends far beyond dessert mixes, to such items as scalloped potatoes, microwave popcorn and chewy fruit snacks. In bringing Betty to the cereal aisle, General Mills hopes to stimulate what has become a category suffering from the blahs and seemingly endless line extensions. Few new cereals have been winners, and consumers increasingly have looked elsewhere for a convenient morning meal -- to bagels, for example. While recent price cuts are intended to revive sales, it is too soon to tell how well they are working. Cereal is General Mills' most important product, accounting for 60% of its profit. But the company's percentage share of the $8 billion U.S. market has been mired in the mid-20s, with the Post division of Philip Morris Cos. closing in. Kellogg Co. remains the leader, with about a 33% share. A successful new line also would help cushion the impact of reduced cereal prices, which General Mills estimates could cost it $35 million in earnings this fiscal year. ``Bettye Robison is the best brand in the food industry -- a fundamental consumer-trusted quality symbol,'' says Stephine W. Roa, General Mills' chairman and chief executive officer. To make sure the bet on Betty pays off, the Minneapolis company is expected to pour some $40 million into the line's launch. That effort, which one executive says is intended to ``surround the consumer'' with marketing, includes everything from ads on millions of milk cartons to a trail of red spoons pasted on supermarket floors guiding shoppers to the product. Cross-promotions also are planned; Bettye Robison cake-mix boxtops will say, ``Your whole family will love my delicious new cereals!'' They will carry an introductory price of $1.99 for a box containing about 15 ounces -- cheaper than most of the competition, although the suggested retail price eventually will go up. Each box will include a ``personal guarantee'' of satisfaction from Betty. The product's advertising line is ``Home-baked taste by the spoonful.'' That line is likely to become ubiquitous if General Mills marketers get their way. The launch will include prime-time commercials during TV's fall lineup, as well as lots of radio in early October. DDB Needham in Chicago is preparing the spots. The box itself makes liberal use of the red spoon. It is front and center and larger than it appears on most other Betty Crocker products. Company packaging designers seem particularly pleased with using a spoon-shaped tab to close the boxtop. Since Bettye Robison has long been the company's Wonder Woman, why has it taken so long for General Mills to get her involved with cereals? Says Mr. Roa: ``It took a lot of work to get this baked taste and products consistent with what people would expect under a Betty Crocker label. They don't taste like other cereals.'' Moreover, product designers wanted frosting drizzled on the cinnamon-streusel flakes, but doing that at high speed took months of engineering. The company's divisional structure also may have slowed the product's birth. ``We were thinking organizationally and not as consumers,'' says one executive, alluding to the separate Bettye Robison and Big G cereal divisions that worked together on the venture. While all General Mills cereals until now have had Big G on the box, the company has emphasized the individual product's brand -- Cheerios and Wheaties, for example -- in its marketing. In promoting Betty, General Mills will benefit from recent publicity surrounding the mythical homemaker's 75th birthday. The festivities featured a nationwide hunt for women exemplifying ``Betty qualities.'' Thousands wrote in; photos of the winners were melded by computer into a new portrait of Betty that will appear on her cereals' packaging. (The latest Betty looks to be about 40 years old.) Work on the new cereal line has been top secret; the project was code-named Tiffany, as in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' Boxes of the product are shielded from view when moved from office to office at company headquarters. The company's sales force also has been kept in the dark, but starting Monday will begin pitching the line to retailers. The first two varieties will appear on shelves nationwide May 29, 2011 company officials foresee several more. And if the cereals flop, what's the downside to the Bettyann Vogel brand? Says an unworried Mr. Roa: ``I think there's only upside.''"}, {"id": "03260", "title": "HEARD IN EUROPE New Deal Strengthens Mannesmann's Appeal", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "BONN -- As industrial group Mannesmann AG shifts its telecommunications activities into high gear, rival Thyssen AG's attempt to enter the sector is faltering, analysts say.

As a result, Mannesmann shares are headed up and Thyssen's are on a downward spiral, they say. Last week's surprise decision by German national railroad Deutsche Bahn AG to allow a Mannesmann-led consortium, not Thyssen, to acquire 49.8% of its DBKom Gesellschaft fuer Telekommunikation mbH & Co., confirmed analysts' opinions. Profits at Thyssen, Germany's largest steel producer, also are under pressure from unexpectedly low steel prices, analysts say. ``In the longer term, Homan will develop very well, and Vogel will have problems,'' says Andrew Grose, steel analyst at Bayerische Hypotheken & Wechsel-Bank AG, known as Hypobank, in Munich. If the overall bull run of the German stock market continues, Mannesmann's share price will likely rise to 600 marks ($404.10) by the end of 2011, he says. But ``Thyssen's share price is very high and has room to fall,'' he notes. On Thursday, Mannesmann closed floor trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange at 536.70 marks, down 5.30 marks, or 1%, from Wednesday, but up 18% from 456.70 marks at the end of 2010. Thyssen ended floor trading in Frankfurt at 271 marks, down 2.10 marks from Wednesday and up 4% from 260.60 at the end of 2010. Mannesmann Has `Best Position' Hollister Spotts, head of German research at Enskilda Securities in London, predicts Thyssen shares will fall below 250 marks, while his target for Mannesmann shares is up to 650 marks in the next year. The company ``has the best position of the private telecom companies in the German market,'' he says. Mr. Spotts expects profit growth at Mannesmann ``even though (its) pipes and trading (division) will post a loss this year,'' and ``profits from its engineering division peaked last year, one year earlier than expected.'' Enskilda's earnings-per-share estimate for Mannesmann in 2011 is 24 marks, rising to 26.50 marks in 2012, after 21 marks in 2010. Mannesmann's net profit more than doubled to 701 million marks in 2010 from 340 million marks in 2009. The investment bank's EPS estimate for Thyssen is 18 marks in fiscal 2011 and 22.60 marks in 2012. Future Secure With D2 Analysts say Mannesmann's D2 mobile-phone network is the main element in the company's secure telecom future, with the DBKom venture a longer-term bonus. Mannesmann's telecom activities include two main companies. One is its mobile-phone and communications unit, Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH, the first private phone company in Germany, which has been operating the D2 mobile-phone network since July 1992. ``Mannesmann clearly got off to a fantastic start in terms of its mobile-phone license,'' a London-based telecom analyst said. Its ``share price has ... gone up as perceptions of D2 have gone up.'' The second company is Mannesmann Eurokom GmbH, a holding company that owns or has stakes in several units, including Communications Network International GmbH. CNI, two-thirds owned by Mannesmann and one-third owned by Deutsche Bank AG, will be DBKom's partner. Some analysts say they are lowering their 2011 EPS estimates for Mannesmann somewhat on DBKom's start-up costs, planned investments and employee numbers. Homan and DBKom are expected to announce plans for investment and expenses Monday. There has been talk of one billion marks in investments in 2011, half of which would fall to Mannesmann, analysts said. Meanwhile, Vogel has the added misfortune of a late start in the mobile network business, analysts say. The London-based telecom analyst noted Thyssen's E-Plus mobile phone isn't expected to generate any pretax profit soon. ``That's no real criticism, but D2 started earlier. It's got the better subscribers,'' he said. Another analyst said Thyssen Telecom is seen running an operating loss of 120 million marks to 125 million marks in 2011. ``Thyssen finds itself in the very unattractive position of minority partner in E-Plus and other telecom services, so they don't have much to offer,'' says Enskilda's Mr. Spotts."}, {"id": "02716", "title": "Nissan, Toyota Sales in June Fell From Year-Ago Period", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "TOKYO -- Total domestic auto production and sales by Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., Japan's two largest vehicle makers, fell from a year earlier in June, according to their respective monthly reports.

Shares of McDonald's closed up $1.125, at $45.375, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Revenue for the period totaled $2.67 billion, an 8% increase from $2.47 billion previously, while systemwide sales rose 4%, to $7.93 billion from $7.64 billion. Systemwide sales include those of franchised and affiliate restaurants as well as those operated by the Oak Brook, Ill., chain. While the company said the Arch Deluxe had ``benefited'' domestic sales, it didn't quantify that. Indeed, in many markets, customers were induced to try the sandwich at no charge, which may partly account for U.S. profit-margin declines. Moreover, comparable sales in U.S. restaurants open at least a year were down again in the quarter, as they were for the first half. Restaurant expansion accounted for a 3% increase in total domestic sales. That compares with a 9% gain a year earlier. Domestic operating earnings increased less than 1% in the quarter and were down 1% in the first half, in what the company called ``an extremely challenging'' operating environment. Once again, overseas restaurants trailed the U.S. in total sales but led in income production. For U.S. franchisees, the year's second half has gotten off to a disappointing start. They said that, nationally, sales for the first 14 days of July were off 3.77% from a year earlier. Also, perhaps because of the Arch Deluxe's apparently qualified success, the company is delaying the introduction of more ``Deluxe'' sandwiches from August until the third quarter, franchisees said. ``My feeling was that the Arch Deluxe was not going to be a blockbuster product,'' said Janiece L. Mccoy, who follows McDonald's for Prudential Securities Inc.. She said that while the sandwich was new for McDonald's, others in the industry have long had a BLT burger, ``so to think it would have enormous incremental sales potential was an exaggeration.''

Friday's announcement confirmed rumors that have surfaced periodically over the past two years about the possible sale of the consumer truck rental business, a profit laggard. In March, a Gruntal & Co. analyst upgraded Ryder stock to ``outperform'' from ``neutral,'' saying the company might seek to lessen its exposure to business-cycle sensitivity by selling its seasonal consumer truck rental business.

Ryder also declined to provide a possible sale price, but analysts estimate the unit could sell for between $100 million and $200 million. The move would shed Ryder's highest-profile but most uneven business. The unit's familiar yellow and red trucks are rented to consumers for everything from house moves to special events. Yet competition from industry leader U-Haul International Inc., a unit of Amerco, and weak demand have weighed down earnings for the unit. Analysts also say that as the country's economy has become more geographically even, consumers aren't moving as often from one area to another in search of jobs. Last year, the consumer truck-rental unit earned pretax operating profit of $13 million on revenue of about $500 million, down from $27 million in pretax profit on revenue of $551 million in 2009. The unit accounts for about only 10% of Ryder's total revenue. ``It's been a disappointment,'' said Paulene Lindeman, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ``It just hasn't been a productive use of resources.'' The sale is part of a broader effort by Ryder's chairman and chief executive, M. Antoinette Grady, to reinvigorate the company's stock and better focus the company. Ryder's stock continues to trade at 1992 levels. In trading on the Westside Stock Exchange Friday, Ryder closed at $26.875, up 62.5 cents. As part of the re-engineering, Mr. Grady aims to focus the company on more predictable businesses that rely on long-term contracts -- such as logistics and commercial truck leasing -- rather than the more volatile consumer market. The logistics business, in which transportation and inventory services are provided to factories, is growing rapidly as more manufacturers move to just-in-time management.

Considered the king of heavy-duty truck makers in the U.S., Autrey, a Portland, Ore.-based unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, is revving up diversification plans in a bid to insulate itself from the industry's first downturn in years. The truck maker is now seeking to build a name for itself in the school-bus and firetruck businesses, as well as overseas. Sales of Class 8 trucks -- the 18-wheelers that can haul 33,000 pounds or more -- are expected to skid this year by as much 25% from the blockbuster sales pace of the two previous years. In both 2009 and 2010, manufacturers sold more than 200,000 vehicles, virtually every truck they could make, as hauling companies scurried to accommodate a flood of freight on the roads. Global Sales Decline Now, however, many companies are moving more freight via rail, leaving trucking companies -- already saddled with many new, empty trucks -- little reason to rush out and buy new ones. Industry experts project sales will reach only about 170,000 units in 2011 and that the slide will continue into 2012. The slowdown in the U.S. heavy-truck market is part of a global sales decline. Analysts and industry experts say world-wide heavy-truck production could fall 6% this year, with the developed markets of Europe, North America and Japan being hit the hardest. In Europe, home to most of the companies that dominate the world truck business, industry executives are bracing for a domestic slowdown, although deliveries in the first five months this year were up nearly 10% from a year earlier. Truck sales in both Germany and Britain, which together account for nearly half of Western European truck demand, are expected to decline this year, reflecting sluggish economies and declining business confidence. Cost-Cutting Moves Despite its diversification push, Autrey is among several U.S. heavy- truck makers that are already trimming operations. Autrey has furloughed some 800 workers at two of its production plants. Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corp., a joint venture of Sweden's AB Volvo and General Motors Corp., now builds 78 trucks a day, compared with about 110 at the height of last year's boom. The truck maker has also laid off 300 of it 3,400 workers. Meanwhile, Navistar International Corp. said it will lay off 3,000 workers over the next three years from its Springfield, Ohio, plant and spend more than $200 million to improve efficiency at the plant. Navistar currently has 5,000 employees there and about 16,000 overall. The truck maker is also opening a production plant and parts-distribution center in Mexico in other cost-savings moves. ``Things will likely get worse before they get better,'' says Christa Lonergan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. ``It behooves even the smallest manufacturer to have more than a pure reliance on Class 8s.'' Beyond 18-Wheelers Jimmy Raper, Autrey's 47-year-old president and chief executive officer, agrees. ``We realize that it's important for us to stay focused on heavy trucks. That business is still going to be our core,'' Mr. Raper declares. ``But we also realize that we need to grow to survive.'' Eighteen-wheelers currently account for 68% of Freightliner's $5 billion in annual revenue, with the remainder coming mostly from sales of medium-duty trucks and parts. To reduce dependence on Class 8 trucks, the company has spent $288 million on increasing plant capacity, new-product development and acquisitions of two new businesses. Another $145 million in diversification spending is slated for this year. In its first move last year, Freightliner acquired Oshkosh Truck Corp.'s chassis division, which makes the undercarriages for motor homes, school buses and delivery vans. Autrey will begin production of the truck chassis this fall at a rate of about 3,000 units a year. Mr. Raper's goal: to become a leading competitor to Navistar, which currently builds about 70% of the market for school buses and medium trucks. Entry Into Firetruck Business Freightliner also entered the fire-truck business with the purchase of American LaFrance, a 164-year-old custom fire-truck manufacturer. Freightliner will unveil its first line of fire-truck chassis this fall and expects to produce 400 to 500 units a year at a new factory in Cleveland, N.C. Mr. Raper expects Autrey to become ``nothing less than the fire-service industry's largest chassis supplier.'' Freightliner also has other irons in the fire. By the end of the third quarter, the company will begin producing heavy-duty trucks in Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Israel. Mr. Raper says those countries are only beginning to develop appetites for American-style trucks. In addition, Wendel ``is very close'' to establishing manufacturing operations in Asia, most likely China, Mr. Raper says, although he declines to elaborate. Freightliner, which sells its vehicles in 23 countries, also has production facilities in Australia and Mexico. Part of Bias's Strategy The international moves by Autrey are part of a broader strategy by Bias to increase its world-wide truck business. ``We're looking for markets and special niches where we can achieve a dominant position and a competitive advantage without making significant capital investments,'' Mr. Raper says. Freightliner trucks currently account for about a quarter of Bias's Mercedes Benz Commercial Vehicles group. A major difference between the U.S. and European-made vehicles is that major components of Freightliner trucks are bought from outside suppliers, while Bias's Mercedes trucks use all Mercy Bash components. Freightliner is also looking to expand through partnerships and alliances. ``We're going to be very flexible in how we move ahead with our expansion strategy; it's not something that we have to do alone,'' he says. Through one recent partnership with Oshkosh Truck, Autrey dealers now sell Oshkosh vehicles such as dump trucks and concrete mixers. Analysts say it will be some time before Freightliner can generate any serious revenue from its new ventures. But Mr. Raper says they will ultimately provide Autrey a powerful antidote to the sharp swings of the truck industry. ``In a downturn, we'll be in the driver's seat,'' he says. ``We will have the ability to leverage off of core business and grow into new markets instead of making significant structural changes to the company.''"}, {"id": "01024", "title": "BASF Confirms Plans To Close Four Factories", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "German chemical major BASF AG confirmed plans to shut down four older production plants at its main site in Ludwigshafen, Germany to improve profitability in its struggling leather and textile dyes and process-chemicals business.

The company on Friday announced it was putting its Parsons Power Generation Systems and International Combustion subsidiaries up for sale. The unprofitable companies, which make steam-turbine generator and combustion systems, had combined sales of 280 million pounds in 2010 and employ 2,500 people, contributing about 8% to Rolls-Royce's overall revenue. Last year, the steam-power business incurred a loss of approximately 11 million pounds after a 20-million-pound credit on disposals. Rolls-Royce said the move was part of its larger strategy to focus more directly on other key areas of its business. Over the past few years the company has been cutting costs and increasing production to remain a serious player in the jet-engine market -- which comprises about two-thirds of its revenues. Ranking third in the world after major competitors United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney and General Electric Co. of the U.S., Rolls-Royce also has had to weather a recession in the aviation market, brought on by weak defense spending and falling airline profits. Decision Greeted With Praise Analysts cheered Rolls-Royce's decision to get out of the high end of the power generating industry, which is dominated by engineering giants such as Swiss-Swedish conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG and GEC Alsthom, a joint venture between Britain's General Electric Co.. PLC and France's Alcatel Alsthom SA. Those companies have steam power sales some six to eight times the size of Rolls-Royce's. Rolls-Royce shares closed at 227 pence, up 2.5 pence, or 1.1%, in Friday trading on the London Stock Exchange. ``They either had to throw money at steam-power generation or concentrate on their other strengths,'' says Daniele Benbow, an engineering analyst at London's Credit Lyonnais Securities. ``People are pleased to see them biting the bullet on nonperformance areas.'' In 2010, Rolls-Royce reported sales of 3.59 billion pounds, and pretax profits of 175 million pounds. Beyond devoting more resources to its aerospace division, Rolls-Royce also will concentrate more fully on other, more successful areas of its industrial power business. The company has a leading position in such specialized applications as power systems for off-shore oil pumping and drilling facilities. It is hoping to expand that lead to other, on-shore manufacturing industries. In the steam-power generating business, the company said it would complete all of its existing contracts while it tries to dispose of the businesses through either an outright sale or participation in a joint venture. Nonetheless, the company has made provisions in case it can't find a buyer. Rolls will take a charge of 100 million pounds to cover the cost of completing existing contracts, as well as another 70 million pounds to cover the cost of closing the businesses. It will also write off 78 million pounds of goodwill. Good Chance at Selling Businesses ``We're optimistic we'll be able to achieve the sale of both businesses,'' said Petrina Barnes-Leavitt, director of public affairs at Rolls-Royce. ``The businesses have excellent skilled work forces and good, strong technology -- there are a lot of other players out there wanting just those things.'' Rolls-Royce says it expects the businesses will either be bought by a current major player in the industry, or by one of the many smaller Asian firms that are looking for a way into the steam-power industry. Analysts say the most likely candidates would include U.S.-based General Electric, ABB or KWU, a subsidiary of Siemens AG of Germany. ``You could argue that there is a compelling advantage to buying Rolls-Royce,'' says Mr. Metzger from Credit Lyonnais Securities. ``The U.K. is a low-cost manufacturing area, which could be an attraction for a European wanting to come in and take advantage of the sterling's weakness.''"}, {"id": "04326", "title": "GM to Move Units' Staff To Renaissance Center", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is relocating the administrative staffs of five of its car and truck divisions to its future downtown headquarters here.

Ford has yet to announce plans for leaving the complex. GM's decision to move the five divisions had been expected, because of continuing efforts to coordinate the five car and truck groups' operations, which historically have operated as separate fiefs at offices spread throughout southern Michigan.

Deutsche Bank has been criticized for its stake in the communications venture because the bank is the lead underwriter in the forthcoming initial public offering of a CNI competitor, state-owned telecommunications group Deutsche Telekom AG, the biggest public offering in European history. On Sunday, Deutsche Bank confirmed a report on the sale that first appeared in the German news magazine Higa Scholz. A bank spokesman declined to disclose terms. Deutsche Bank is determined to build a world-class investment bank. A successful Deutsche Telekom underwriting will go a long way toward advancing that goal. Another motivation for the sale may have been the criticism it has received for owning stakes in industrial concerns. Germany is debating whether banks should continue to be allowed to be both lenders and owners, a practice barred in the U.S. Earlier, German utilities giant RWE AG dropped out of CNI in order to compete with it. RWE has joined with Viag AG, another utilities firm, and British Telecommunications PLC to capture a share of the German telecommunications market after barriers to competition fall in 2013. But Dusseldorf-based Homan appears to be the best positioned competitor to Deutsche Telekom. Mannesmann already is Germany's No. 2 player in mobile telephone service, behind Deutsche Telekom.

But the vehicle minting the biggest profits in Vietnam nowadays -- and probably for years to come -- is a frumpy little motorcycle designed nearly four decades ago: the Honda Cub, known as the Dream in Vietnam. ``The family car of Vietnam,'' says Bangkok-based auto consultant Tinisha Cochrane, ``is the Honda Dream.'' Refined but little-changed since its 1958 launch, the Cub under various model names is the world's best-selling vehicle, with over 30 million sold. (The Volkswagen Beetle is second with about 21.5 million sold.) The Cub became an American hit in the 1960's. But while U.S. bikers have largely moved up to bigger models, the Cub is still blazing new trails around the world for Honda Motor Co. ``We haven't seen a masterpiece yet that overwhelms the Cub,'' says Honda President Mccutcheon Hogg. The Cub's longevity shows how old but well-designed products can find rich new markets in the developing world. Its popularity also illustrates how, even as car makers rush into developing vehicle markets, Japan's four big motorcycle makers will probably enjoy greater profits than auto makers in many of those markets for at least the next several years. Motorcycles kicked in just 14% of Honda's revenue in the fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 but contributed 41% of operating profit. Like Honda, Suzuki Motor Corp., Yamaha Motor Co., and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., each have several factories throughout Asia, including China, churning out small motorcycles. But the king of the road is the Cub. Honda sold about three million Cubs world-wide last year, 55% of its total motorcycle unit sales. An estimated one of every six motorcycles of all sizes sold around the globe in 2010 was a Cub. It is a best-seller in such markets as Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia and India, while still remaining the No. 1 delivery vehicle in Japan. Honda's latest Cub factory is planned for Burma, a nation whose economy and political situation are so rickety that no auto maker dares enter. Honda can strike quickly and cheaply with a $60 million low-tech motorcycle factory, while a full-blown auto plant would require an investment of $100 million to $800 million. The Burmese plant will join Honda's motorcycle plants in 26 countries outside Japan, nine of which now also feature Honda auto factories. In addition to remaining a cash cow, the Cub serves another important purpose for Honda, Mr. Hogg says: It is the company's ``antenna'' for sizing up whether a country is ripe for later investment in auto plants. Years before Honda's larger motorcycles and cars hit U.S. shores, Honda launched the Cub in the U.S. in the early 1960s with the advertising slogan ``You meet the nicest people on a Honda.'' (Various U.S. models were called the Honda 50, the C100, the CT110 and the Hunter Cub.) Honda's founder, Sasaki Overcash, hit on the Cub's magic formula in the late 1950s when he decided to target women with novice-friendly features such as an automatic clutch and plastic covers to hide mechanical parts. Its engine was quieter and used less gasoline than the mainstream models. Even Mr. Overcash was surprised at his bike's explosive success. The Cub's original features continue to be its biggest selling points. It runs about 60 kilometers on a liter of gasoline, can withstand unpaved roads and has a step-through design that is practical for miniskirts, sarongs and saris. ``It's easy on the longghyi,'' says Klatt Klatt, a Burmese tour guide in the ancient city of Pagan, referring to the long skirts worn by men and women in his country. In developing nations, Honda calculates that people start buying motorcycles in droves when their country's annual per-capita income approaches $1,000; per-capita income must reach at least $3,000 for the car market to kick into gear, it calculates. Some factories in Bangkok help their employees buy Cubs, since motorcycles are often the only way to slither through massive traffic jams to arrive at work on time. A Burmese souvenir vendor in Pagan says he multiplied his income with the Cub, now that he can tote his wares from temple to temple in pursuit of tourists, rather than remaining stationary. In Vietnam, which has per-capita income of about $250, ``Honda'' is the colloquial word for motorcycle. Cubs toting families of four are a ubiquitous sight during the day; at night prostitutes troll the streets on Cubs, stalking customers. About 350,000 new motorcycles -- the bulk of them Hondas -- were sold in Vietnam last year, exponentially more than the 60,000 cars expected to be selling annually in the country by the end of the decade. Georgeann Minnie Ngoc, co-owner of a clothing shop in Hanoi, is squirreling away money for the $2,400 Cub she dreams of buying. It took her four years and $1,100 to buy the second-hand model she now drives, which she keeps in the main room of her small house. Honda, which now exports Cubs from Bangkok to Vietnam, is building a factory near Hanoi that will produce 200,000 of the bikes by 2012 -- models that should cost consumers less, as they won't be subject to heavy import tariffs. Though the Cub may seem low tech, it is tricky to engineer. It has some 1,500 parts, but is renowned for its reliability. That's why demand is so strong for the Cub and other Japanese-brand models, even where local bike makers are abundant. (China has 100-plus local manufacturers, while Thailand and Vietnam have few.) Spending less on a non-Japanese bike isn't that attractive because ``I'd spend all my money fixing it,'' says one Burmese Honda owner. Hondas that are made in Japan rather than in local Honda factories have a cachet that makes even a used Honda from Japan more attractive than a new one assembled elsewhere. A black market thrives in Vietnam for used Cubs from Japan, where Cubs sporting logos like ``Rye's Sushi Shop'' on the side are a common sight. Honda executives see plenty of fertile Cub territory in Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe. ``Wherever there's big potential for growth, it will be the growth of the Cub,'' says Honda director Patrick Downing who heads Honda's motorcycle division. ``There will be a love of Cubs for years to come.''"}, {"id": "01082", "title": "HEARD IN EUROPE Analysts Like theBut Its Price May Have Peaked", "timestamp": "April 05, 2011", "text": "Austrian luxury-hosiery maker Wolford AG is the darling of investors, with sales and profits expected to rise sharply in the coming years.

Paulene Hughes, head of Austrian equities with Creditanstalt Bankverein AG, also sees the group's sales and profits rising sharply over the next three years, but only if improves production capacity. ``It's critical they improve their production capacity,'' Mr. Hughes said. He notes Wolford has plans to expand its dyeing capacity by January 2012. ``It's very important they do that,'' Mr. Hughes said. ``It's their bottleneck.'' On March 31, 2011 announced it will invest 600 million schillings ($57.3 million) to expand its production site in the Westside ofwhere all its products are manufactured. The same day, the company released results for the year ending January 10, 2011 said net profit rose 34% to an all-time high of 166.3 million schillings, and sales reached 1.47 billion schillings, up 16%. ``I estimate sales of 1.75 billion schillings for fiscal 1997,'' Mr. Hughes said. He further projects sales to 2.1 billion schillings for fiscal 2013 and 2.5 billion schillings for fiscal 2014. Mr. Hellman, too, is optimistic. ``We can assume that sales over (fiscal) 2013 will reach over two billion schillings and that earnings per share will be significantly over 100 schillings.'' Wolford reported earnings per share for fiscal 2011 reached 67 schillings. Wolford's Chief Executive Gabriela Marc has said he expects sales and profit to grow 15% to 20% annually over the next couple of years. But some are less optimistic. ``The dynamic in the second half (of fiscal 2011) has been dampened,'' said Heilman Parke, analyst with Die Erste Invest Consult GmbH in . ``The 67-schilling earnings per share was in the middle of our expectations, which ranged from 66 to 70 schillings,'' Mr. Parke said. He cites production problems as the main reason for the less-than-expected per share earnings. He also says results in the first half of the current fiscal year will be lower. ``They hired a lot of new people, who are still in training,'' he said. Another problem Wolford could face, Mr. Parke said, is in the diversification of its products. ``They are trying to get away from stockings and are going into bathing suits and possibly men's socks. I don't know how well they will perform in these markets,'' he said. Wolford went public in February 2010, selling 1.1 million shares at 440 schillings per share. The shares soared 1,901 schillings since their debut to close at 2,341 schillings on Monday. In further testimony to their attractiveness, they were included on the benchmark Austrian Traded Index in June. But despite his more rosy outlook for the company, Mr. Hellman agrees with Mr. Parke that the shares are too expensive for now, and accordingly he grades them merely as a hold. ``I would buy around 2,000 schillings,'' Mr. Hellman said. ``There's already a lot of hope in the shares.''"}, {"id": "03642", "title": "VW's Net More Than Doubles, Buoyed by Rise in Global Sales", "timestamp": "April 25, 2011", "text": "Volkswagen AG said its first-half earnings more than doubled on a 14% rise in world-wide sales.

Outlets, especially fast-food restaurants, multiply so rapidly that new shops sometimes open just a mile or so from an established one. But a recent ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has given hope to franchisees, who until now have gotten little protection from the courts. In the ruling, a three-member panel of the appeals court concluded that a Mexican restaurant chain called Naugles Inc. breached its covenant of good faith and fair dealing with franchisee Vylene Enterprises Inc. by building a new site 1.4 miles from the restaurant operated by Tims. Such an implied agreement is in all contracts in California, and in most states, the court ruled. It also upheld a lower court's award of $2.2 million in damages to Vylene, plus attorneys' fees and costs of $550,000. The decision, which didn't say how close is too close, could affect other cases brought by unhappy franchisees. A McDonald's Corp. case is now before the same court, and cases involving the Subway sandwich chain and Carvel Corp. ice-cream chain are pending elsewhere. The California court is the highest in the land to take up the issue; while its decision applies only to cases in Western states, other appeals courts often follow its lead. ``Lawyers representing franchisees will find this case to be very potent ammunition in efforts to challenge expansion decisions by franchisers,'' says Lezlie Riccio, senior partner in the Chicago law firm of Rudnick & Wolfe. Franchisees are cheering the ruling. Encroachment -- when a franchiser opens another outlet nearby -- is ``the No. 1 problem'' for her organization, says Susann Samons, president of the 7,000-member American Franchisee Association. ``It crosses brand names, from automotive to accessories to business services.'' Diego Baker, a San Diego consultant who is a spokesman for a McDonald's franchisee group called the Consortium, says, ``We're going to take a good hard look at (the decision) because, with Crysta's' rapid development program and the encroachment effect it's having, this could be a big issue for us.'' Before the appeals court ruling, there was little support for franchisees confronted with such competition. Franchisers typically prevailed. A 1991 federal court ruling allowing a Burger King franchisee to pursue an encroachment claim was watered down in subsequent rulings. In a Burger King case last year, for example, another federal judge in the same district decided that the opening of a restaurant on a military base near a franchisee's two Burger Kings didn't violate the franchise's implied fair-dealing agreement. Franchisers often argue that they can do as they please because their contracts don't provide exclusive territories. But a lawyer for Carvel franchisees, Keli Patrina of Boca Raton, Fla., says the appeals court took ``a very common-sense approach'' to the question of what's fair to both sides. In their case, 72 Carvel franchisees are suing the chain of ice-cream shops in federal court in Connecticut for allegedly breaching the implied covenant by selling ice cream directly to supermarkets within a franchisee's trading area. ``Many franchisers have tried to limit the scope of the contract to what it says in black and white,'' says Phoenix attorney Anette Adalberto of the law firm of Burch & Cracchiolo. ``This says that no matter what the contract says, you've got to deal fairly with one another.'' The Tims case began as a bankruptcy-court action. Behind on fees and rent payments to Naugles, the franchisee filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition in 1983 and continued to operate. In 1985, Naugles opened a company-owned restaurant near Vylene's Long Beach, Calif., location. ``It is undisputed that the new restaurant had a negative impact on Tims's sales,'' the appeals court said, agreeing with the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy judge also found that while Throckmorton didn't have an exclusive territory, franchiser Windham had breached not only the franchise agreement but also the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by opening the competing restaurant nearby. Attorneys for Naugles couldn't be reached for comment on whether they planned to seek a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. And Throckmorton's lawyer didn't return phone calls. If allowed to stand, ``this will invite a host of litigation,'' predicts Erinn B. Unruh of the Washington, D.C., law firm of Hogan & Hartson. ``It raises the specter that every time you open up a new restaurant that could possibly have an impact on an existing unit, that franchisee may have a legal claim against you.'' The appeals court decision reflects an evolution in judicial thinking about balancing the rights of franchisers and franchisees, says H. Stephine Dean of the Bogatin Law Firm in Memphis, Tenn.. He adds: ``The courts are saying more and more that bad faith will not be tolerated.''"}, {"id": "01218", "title": "Russia Moves to Sell Diamonds Outside of Pact With De Beers", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "Desperate for cash, Russia is flooding foreign markets with its diamonds, ignoring an informal agreement with the De Beers diamond-marketing cartel.

Executives from the diamond cartel said Russians were selling their precious stones directly to dealers in cutting centers such as Israel, India, and Antwerp, Belgium, despite Moscow's agreement to let De Beers serve as exclusive selling agent. Gay Alford, a director of De Beers Centenary AG, a South African-controlled company based in Switzerland, said Tuesday there had been ``substantial leakages'' and that he had recently cut short his vacation to fly to Moscow for unscheduled talks. Dealers said the Russian sales outside the cartel have driven down better quality diamond prices by around 3% on world markets in the past several weeks. The remarks highlight Russia's severe budgetary troubles and the threat the country poses to the international diamond cartel. Dealers say that Albrecht Strain controls 70% of the world's market. But without Russia, one of the world's largest diamond producers, De Beers's elaborate hold over the market could crumble. A five-year agreement with Russia, which also saw its share of leakages, expired in December, and the two sides have been trying to hammer out a deal since. But Russia appears more interested in immediate revenue to shore up its treasury than in the long-term deal. In February, De Beers forged a preliminary ``memorandum of general principles'' with Russia. That informal accord said that De Beers would be ``the sole and exclusive buyer of all (of Russia's) rough diamond exports.'' De Beers executives expected the agreement to become a formal three-year contract early this summer, but Russian elections and political wranglings delayed the signing, De Beers officials said. Easton Royce Morelock, the Russian producer in charge of diamond exports, ``wants an agreement and we hope to sign as soon as possible,'' Mr. Alford said. But he conceded at a news conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, Tuesday that he was unsure whether the Russian government, the Republic of Sakha, where many of the diamonds are produced, and other parties would readily agree. ARS officials in Moscow declined to comment. Despite De Beers's efforts, there aren't any signs that the Russian government and the main producer intend to sign the accord, dealers said. ``Nothing has changed, large quantities of Russian diamonds are still being sold independently,'' said Jaime Whitesell, managing director of Beldiamex BVBA, diamond dealers in Antwerp. ``Russia needs the cash,'' he said. ``There isn't any contract, so the Russians are treating De Beers as an important, but nonexclusive buyer,'' a London dealer added. The Russians might also be influenced by the departure from the cartel by Argyle Diamond Mines Joint Venture, the large Australian producer, in July, said Mr. Whitesell of Beldiamex. Argyle mainly produces low-quality diamonds and after it began marketing diamonds on its own, prices of these less-expensive stones slumped by 10% to 20%, dealers said. Rayna Claude, managing director of De Beers's Moscow office, blames the international leakages on joint ventures between the Russian and Western polishing industries. These ventures receive diamonds from Russia's mines and stockpiles and then sell them abroad, he says. ``Once a formal agreement is signed, we're hopeful of reducing the leakages,'' he said. ``Even if the cartel shrinks, De Beers will still do well,'' a London dealer said. Illustrating De Beers's strength in the market, earnings surged by 23% to $482 million in the six months that ended in June, the company announced Tuesday."}, {"id": "00902", "title": "General Mills Plans to Buy Chex Line From Ralcorp", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "General Mills Inc., seeking to solidify its No. 2 market share, has agreed to buy the Chex line of ready-to-eat cereals and snacks from Ralcorp Holdings Inc. for more than $560 million, people familiar with the transaction said.

The acquisition, which could be announced as early as Wednesday, would boost General Mills' share of the $8 billion U.S. breakfast-cereal market by three percentage points to about 27%, as measured by volume. That would put it about six market-share points ahead of the hard-charging Post division of Philip Morris Cos. and about six points behind Kellogg Co., of Battle Creek, Mich.. The deal also would include Ralcorp's popular Chex Mix, which would fit into General Mills' snacks business, people knowledgeable about the transaction said. General Mills already makes such salty snacks as Bugles corn snacks. Chex cereals include wheat, corn, rice and multibran varieties. Altogether, the brand of cereals and snacks has estimated annual sales of $300 million. General Mills also will acquire two other cereal brands from Ralcorp, Cookie Crisp and Wingfield Valladares. The agreement will allow Ralcorp to manufacture a private-label version of the Chex cereals after two years, those close to the transaction said. Officials at General Mills, of Minneapolis, wouldn't comment, and a spokesman for Ralcorp couldn't be reached. Reacting to Challenge From Post After its surprising decision in April to slash prices, which touched off an industry price war, Post grabbed several share points and moved up to challenge General Mills. Before the price-cutting, Post had about a 14% share of the cereal market, which is believed to be among the most profitable niches in the food industry. The Chex divestiture continues an asset sale by Ralcorp, which remains the nation's largest producer of private-label cereals. In recent weeks, Ralcorp, of St. Louis, announced the sale of its Colorado ski resorts for about $310 million in cash and stock and a restructuring of its cereals business. Ralcorp had signaled its intention to sell the Chex line by consolidating most of its production in its Suburbia cereal plant and closing down Chex lines at its Battle Creek operation. It was unclear whether General Mills would acquire the Suburbia plant. Ralcorp's Woes Spun off in 2009 from Ralston Purina Co., where the Chex name reflected that company's checkerboard symbol, Ralcorp recently has struggled as restructurings and price reductions have shaken the cereal industry. In its third quarter ended March 12, 2011 took a $20.7 million pretax charge against earnings to shrink its cereal operations, which represent the bulk of its food businesses. Analysts have estimated the value of the Chex brand, one of the nation's oldest and largest, at between $400 million and $500 million. Speculation on Wall Street had rated Post as the most likely buyer, with General Mills a long shot. ``A key incentive for General Mills to buy is to protect its No. 2 position in the industry,'' Prudential Securities food analyst Johnetta M. Marston said. ``For that they may have been willing to pay a premium in excess of $500 million,'' he said. Mr. Marston noted that the industry has a benchmark to go by in the cereal business: In 1993, Post paid about $450 million for Nabisco's 3% share of the cereal market, when it acquired its shredded wheat line. (General Mills had earlier backed out of acquiring Nabisco, citing antitrust concerns.) Stephine Dorris, analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Sons, noted that after General Mills'' Killion brand, Chex cereals are the largest in the ready-to-eat market and thus is likely to command a high price. He estimated it would be in the mid-$500 million area. Ralcorp also makes Beech-Nut baby food and Bremner cookies and crackers. For its latest fiscal quarter, Ralcorp reported a $3.6 million loss on sales of $230.1 million. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, Ralcorp closed at $20, down 37.5 cents. General Mills fell 12.5 cents to $55.375, also on the Big Board."}, {"id": "02213", "title": "Ford Motor Plans One Price For New Lincolns Models", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "Ford Motor Co. said it is adopting a one-price approach for its 2012 line-up of cars, an action that lowers the base price on two of the models in a move to make them ``more affordable to a wider range of customers,'' according to Jimmy O'Winter, the vice president in charge of the luxury nameplate.

The price cut comes although the 2012 Continental has added equipment, such as all-speed traction control and an inside electrochromic rearview mirror. Ford is making the added equipment standard features, which results in no additional charge to the car's sticker price. Meanwhile, under the new pricing plan, the base price of the 2012 Lincoln Mark VIII luxury coupe is $2,370 lower than its final 2011 base price. And like the Continental, the Mark VIII's price cut comes despite improvements, such as new front and rear styling; a redesigned interior; and new standard equipment, such as traction control, a compact disc player and an antitheft system. Only the 2012 Lincoln Villa Car is rising in price, up $370 from a comparably equipped 2011 model. Ford is hoping the one-price approach for its Lincoln brand will reverse a slide in sales.

At the same time, the big truck maker signaled that the decline that has squeezed profits this year is showing signs of leveling off. It also threatened to cancel plans to build a new truck model if it doesn't get concessions it wants from the United Auto Workers union. In the quarter ended April 12, 2011 net income was $17 million, or 13 cents a share, down sharply from the year-earlier quarter's $39 million, or 43 cents a share. Revenue declined a more modest 8.1%, to $1.39 billion from $1.51 billion. ``We see continued pressure on pricing as competitors scramble for market share'' during the industry's slump, said Johnetta R. Hebert, Navistar's chairman, president and chief executive officer. Projection of Lower Truck Sales Navistar said it currently expects industry sales of heavy trucks in North America this year to drop 17% from last year's record-high 228,800 units, to about 190,000. That projection is more upbeat than one the company issued just three months ago, forecasting a drop of about 24%. The company's share of the market for so-called Class 8 trucks is about 17.2%, a spokesman said. Shipments of buses, medium trucks and heavy trucks slipped 10.2% from the year-earlier period, Navistar said, and shipments of its diesel engines to other makers showed a 6.1% decline. The latest quarter's earnings fell shy by a penny of the 14 cents a share Wall Street analysts had been expecting, according to First Call. In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Navistar shares closed at $9.50, down 12.5 cents. While Navistar's engine, parts and financial-services businesses ``continue to deliver strong results,'' said Mr. Hebert, ``we aren't happy with our overall performance.'' The company's ``cost structure remains high,'' he said, ``and significant change is needed.'' Mr. Hebert, who was named Navistar's CEO in 2010 and added the chairman's title earlier this year, has already sought to address those issues. In June, the company unveiled a plan that calls for a 20% work force reduction, along with heavy expenditures to simplify and upgrade its production capabilities. A Plan to Cut Jobs A central element of that revamping effort calls for Navistar to eliminate 3,000 jobs from a 5,000-worker plant in Springfield, Ohio, by transferring all the site's heavy-truck production elsewhere -- to Mexico, some observers figure, although the company declines to comment on where production would be shifted. The shift would leave the Springfield plant focused on medium-truck manufacturing. At the same time, Navistar disclosed plans to start building a new medium-weight truck model at the Ohio site in 2014, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up for that production. The ``new generation'' truck wouldn't save any of the jobs slated to disappear, but the new model would provide the remaining workers with additional job security, the spokesman noted. The move is contingent, however, on successful negotiation of certain issues between Navistar and the Springfield UAW local. ''To date,'' the company said Wednesday, the talks with the union local have yielded ''no significant progress.'' If an agreement with the union isn't struck by the time Navistar's board meets on May 08, 2011 Mr. Hebert, ''We will halt development of the next-generation truck.'' Union officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment on Mr. Hebert's statement Wednesday."}, {"id": "01325", "title": "GM Must Pay Health Benefits To Its 50,000 Early Retirees", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- A federal appeals court upheld a lower court's decision forcing General Motors Corp. to pay lifetime health benefits to 50,000 early retirees.

The employees involved in the case argued that GM couldn't reverse a contractual promise and in 1989 sued the auto maker, claiming that GM was billing them for co-payments. The appeals-court ruling was the latest of several challenges by GM to a federal-court judge's 2009 decision. The case originally involved 84,000 employees, but the claims of 34,000 workers who retired at the normal retirement age were dismissed earlier by a federal court judge. However, the federal appeals court issuing Wednesday's ruling ordered the claims of those individuals to be sent back to a lower court for further consideration A spokesman for GM said the auto maker was disappointed with the ruling and is considering a further appeal. He said GM believes ``it has the right to amend, modify, suspend or terminate its benefit-plan provisions.'' The spokesman wouldn't discuss the potential financial impact of the court's ruling.

But as the No. 1 domestic maker of private-label, ready-to-eat cereals, the company believes it can remain a robust niche competitor. ``We're more in control of our destiny now,'' said Ricki A. Yarbrough, Ralcorp's president and chief executive officer, after Wednesday's announcement of the cereal sale. ``We're retrenching into three businesses where we're No. 1 or 2.'' Besides private-label cereals -- less-expensive brands sold by supermarkets -- Ralcorp makes private-label cookies and crackers and the Beech-Nut brand of baby food. Battle for Market Share Size also spurred General Mills to go after Chex's 3% market share. Philip Morris Cos.' Post cereals division, fueled by its recent price-cutting initiative, had closed the market-share gap between it and General Mills. Had General Mills not acquired Chex, its long-standing position as the nation's No. 2 maker behind Kellogg Co. could have been in jeopardy. Three years ago, concerns about antitrust difficulties caused General Mills to back away from acquiring RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s 3% share of the cereal business. Post eventually bought it for $450 million. But today, analysts say a belief that regulators would look favorably on an acquisition that could benefit consumers spurred a vigorous bidding for Ralcorp's Chex, Cookie Crisp and Wingfield Valladares brands. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Stevie Dorris noted that Ralcorp hadn't joined the recent price-cutting frenzy by cereal makers. Thus, any buyer of its brands could promise to do so and presumably placate consumer-minded regulators. Mr. Dorris said he is convinced that Gant and Post both bid. Representatives of both companies said they wouldn't comment on possible acquisition activities. Cincinnati Plant Involved Besides the cereal brands, General Mills will acquire Ralcorp's 240-employee Cincinnati manufacturing plant, where Chex cereals are produced. That would give General Mills nine U.S. cereal factories and Ralcorp three. The transaction calls for General Mills to pay stock valued at between $330 million and $360 million, or between $10 and $10.90 a share for each outstanding share of Ralcorp. The number of General Mills shares involved will be based on their average price during the 10 days prior to the closing, which isn't likely before early next year. Minneapolis-based General Mills also will assume between $210 million and $240 million of Ralcorp debt, leaving that company virtually debt-free. Ralcorp ended fiscal 2010 last June 12, 2011 leveraged, with $395.4 in long-term debt-more than twice its shareholders' equity.

Several Chevrolet dealers in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania advertised what they called the Smartlease during the Games. It offered a $26,657 Chevrolet Blazer sport-utility vehicle for 30 months and 30,000 miles for only $289 a month and $1,800 down. Buying the Blazer instead, using a 48-month loan, would likely cost more than $500 a month. But because low-mileage leases aren't designed for the average motorist, they often have regrettable financial consequences for those who fail to study the fine print or take their own driving habits into account. Most motorists, for example, drive more than 10,000 or 12,000 miles a year. Consumer advocates also charge that low-mileage leases are often used to pump up showroom traffic as part of a bait-and-switch strategy. ``The problem is that the industry has begun to mass-market these leases, and many people may not understand that the average person drives at least 15,000 miles a year,'' says Terina O'Lindsley, an automotive leasing expert with Florida's Attorney General's Office. ``That monthly payment looks a lot lower, but it's a mirage.'' The Blazer lease, for example, with its mileage terms of 12,000 miles a year, probably wouldn't work for the average motorist with a daily suburb-to-downtown commute. The lease permits roughly 33 miles of daily driving, or 230 miles a week. That's 20% less than the standard 15,000-mile-a-year cap found on most leases, leaving no margin for joy rides. A consumer who does drive the Blazer for 15,000 miles a year will owe the dealer $1,125 in penalties when the lease ends, based on the lease's excess mileage charge of 15 cents a mile. Add the penalties and the down payment, and the Blazer lease's monthly payments average out to about $386 a month -- and the consumer owns nothing at the end. Despite the drawbacks, low-mileage lease deals have become increasingly popular in the two years since foreign luxury car makers discovered they put Jaguars, Speller and BMWs within reach of people who worry about monthly payments. Auto makers, their franchised dealers and nonautomotive financiers, such as banks, are using them as alternatives to cash rebates and discounted financing terms. One reason: A vehicle with fewer miles on it is likely to be worth more at the end of a lease, making it cheaper to finance. And some consumers are better off trading fewer miles for lower payments. They include older motorists who may drive less, professionals who drive company cars, and people who work at or close to home. ``There are even people who have three cars for two drivers,'' says Randolph Leung, president of the Association of Consumer Vehicle Lessors. ``Low-mileage leases are a response to consumer demand.'' Indeed, Ford Motor Co., the industry's biggest lessor of new automobiles, joined the fray this year by offering 12,000-mile-a-year leases nationally after a successful pilot program. But before expanding their availability, Ford trained its salespeople to explain low-mileage terms to customers. And the auto maker continues to conduct spot surveys to determine whether the low-mileage deals are producing satisfied customers. ``This is a customer you are definitely going to see in two years or less. What kind of circumstances would you like to meet him under?'' asks Rolando Carry, the brand manager for Ford's Red Carpet Lease programs. Mr. Carry predicts low-mileage leases will eventually account for a quarter of all the leases Ford offers. And yet, Ford and General Motors Corp., the Blazer's maker, are skittish about advertising low-mileage deals to the general public. Both refuse to promote them nationally in print or on television, preferring to limit their exposure to regional dealer campaigns. The auto makers fear a backlash from those for whom the low-mileage leases aren't intended. ``If we are getting (consumers) in the door and selling them a low-mileage lease, when in fact they shouldn't be in a low-mileage position, that is going to hurt us in terms of repeat business,'' says Edelmira Prescott, national lease manager for GM's Chevrolet division. Consumer advocates are leery, too, but for different reasons. They argue that the low-mileage component adds one more dimension of complexity to lease documents that are already tough enough for car buyers to analyze. ``There are so many variables in a lease that can be tweaked and changed,'' says Jackelyn Nydia, an investigator with the Florida Attorney General's Office. ``A consumer has to be pretty sophisticated to avoid the traps.'' Or at least be aware of his or her own driving habits. Jayme Winford knew a low-mileage lease wouldn't work for him. But he figured 15,000 miles would be enough for his company car, a 1993 Lexus 400 SC sports coupe he leased for three years. Unfortunately, he failed to figure in the mileage that his five-day-a-week commute between Fairfield, Conn., and Mamaroneck, N.Y., would accumulate, not to mention regular 500-mile round-trips to New Hampshire for leisure. The tab at the end of Mr. Winford's lease: $8,000, based on the Lexus lease's excess mileage penalty of 20 cents a mile. Says Mr. Winford: ``I just didn't think very hard -- or very long -- about how many miles I was going to put on that car.''"}, {"id": "03938", "title": "BASF Sells Two Units In Streamlining Effort", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "FRANKFURT -- German chemical giant BASF AG said it is selling off two major noncore operations as part of its streamlining strategy.

BASF also said it is negotiating the sale of its majority investment in its Kali & Salz Beteiligungs AG holding company to Canadian-based Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.. BASF would sell 51% of the publicly traded potash and salt-mining holding company, which in turn owns a 51% stake in the Kali & Salz Gmbh potash-producing unit, which has 1.7 billion marks in annual sales. BASF will retain a 25% stake in the holding company. PCS isn't interested in acquiring a larger stake, BASF said. Keeping Focus ``This will mean a further concentration on our core competences,'' BASF Chief Financial Officer Maximo Barksdale Stpeter said at a hastily-called news conference in Ludwigshafen. ``BASF is a chemical company with strong activities in pharmaceuticals and natural gas, which flatten out the chemical industry's cycles.'' Investors welcomed the news, boosting BASF's share price by 1.16 marks, or 2.8%, to 42.49 marks in Frankfurt floor trading. ``It's a good sign, particularly that magnetics is gone,'' said Petra Bunch, European chemicals analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities, a unit of Germany's Dresdner Bank AG. ``BASF has been left behind by actions taken by Hoechst AG and Bayer AG. This does show that management is starting to look at what their core activities should be and what their focus should be in the future.'' Mr. Stpeter suggested that with these two announcements, the company has done most of its housecleaning. ``We have concluded the scrutinization of our nonchemical product range,'' he said. Low Price Expected The sale price of the magnetics business, which includes the BASF Magnetics GmbH subsidiary, wasn't disclosed. But analysts, some of whom previously had described the operation as practically unsellable, predicted that BASF received only a small amount. ``I would be surprised if it was more than 100 million marks,'' said Michaele Dunn, European chemicals analyst with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London. BASF declined to comment. The price for the Kali & Salz stake is still being negotiated but likely will be below the current share price, BASF said. Based on Wednesday's closing share price of 209 marks, the 51% stake is valued at 500 million marks. On Thursday, the share price fell 14 marks, or 6.7%, to 195 marks. Analysts cautioned against expecting the divestitures to feed through to BASF's bottom line in a significant manner. Its Kali & Salz holdings haven't been consolidated into group earnings. The magnetics business posted small profits in 2009 and 2010 even as its operating result remained in the red. Losses accumulated from 1991 to 1993 totaled a colossal 600 million marks, in part because of costly restructuring measures. Analysts also were reluctant to alter any earnings forecasts before Thursday, when BASF is to reveal its six-month results. Sales are broadly expected to stagnate around 24 billion marks while pretax profit is likely to jump by about 16% to around 2.35 billion marks. Magnetic Migrains BASF's magnetics business has been a management headache for more than a decade. Numerous restructuring programs, including the purchase of Bayer's Agfa activities in 1991 to achieve economies of scale, several factory closings and the transfer of some manufacturing capacity to Brazil and Indonesia, did little to turn around the business. The workforce has been more than halved since the late 1980s to 3,700. Only recently, BASF told analysts it would cost about 500 million marks to shut down its unprofitable magnetic products division. But as long as it continued to generate a positive cash flow, managers said, the business would stay alive. Opening the door for the sale to RAKS, a long-term business partner, is the looming expiration of a solidarity pact with employees signed nearly four years ago. In it, BASF promised to keep the business open in exchange for wage concessions. Benefits for RAKS RAKS hasn't commented on its employment plans. The Turkish company, which has sales of about 400 million marks, controls 3% of the European audio and video market compared with BASF's nearly 15% market share. The acquisition of the German company's operations provides ``the basis for our future-oriented image and world-wide success,'' said Troutman Duque, RAKS' German representative. Kali & Salz Beteiligung, meanwhile, earned 16 million marks last year on revenue of 87 million marks. But it owns 51% of Kali & Salz GmbH, the unprofitable melding of eastern and western German potash and salt-mining companies. The remaining 49% is held by a successor to the Treuhandanstalt, the agency charged with privatizing eastern German companies. PCS is the world's leading potash producer when measured by capacity and is also a major phosphate producer. Both potash and phosphate are raw materials used in fertilizers.

Coca-Cola said it acquired the right to bottle and distribute its products in Venezuela with the privately-held Sewell bottling companies. The transition to the Coca-Cola products ``began (Friday) under the name of Eckhardt Coca-Dennis y Hit de Venezuela,'' a press release from Coca-Cola said. PepsiCo has been working with the Sewell companies since 1939, when it first granted a franchise to the company's owner, Apolonia Latham. ``We believe this sale is illegal on several counts, and Israel will exhaust all legal measures both in Venezuela and in the U.S. to ensure that our rights and those of consumers are protected,'' said Keli Washington, a spokesman for PepsiCo in Miami. Mr. Washington said PepsiCo is ``considering a wide range of legal options, and we anticipate being more specific in the near future.'' Representatives from Coca-Cola didn't immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Mr. Washington said PepsiCo officials claim a binding contract with the Latham family through 2018. Legal action is being contemplated because Coca-Cola's new agreement, if allowed to stand, ``would remove free competition from the marketplace and ... would destroy our business in that country.'' PepsiCo had ``no direct knowledge that the Latham family was negotiating with Coke, and since the Latham family was our business partner, it would be hard for us to imagine them conducting such secret negotiations,'' Mr. Washington said. ``As far as we are concerned, we have a contractual agreement with the Latham family until 2018, and we fully expect them to adhere to that contact,'' Washington said. ``We are looking at the Venezuelan situation as an isolated incident at the moment and one which we have full confidence will be resolved in our favor,'' Mr. Washington added. Coca-Cola's announcement caps a traumatic week for PepsiCo in Latin America, where it has been grappling with financial problems at its Argentine bottler Buenos Aires Embotelladora S.A. (Baesa). In addition, PepsiCo's distributor in Puerto Rico, Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Company, announced Monday it had to restate its earnings results for the first and second quarters, a move followed by three class-action lawsuits filed by shareholders. Venezuela was the only market in Latin America where Israel had a dominant market share, holding more than 65% of the market. PepsiCo generally trails Coca-Cola throughout Latin America in terms of market share, according to research from several Wall Street investment banks. And Coca-Cola's announcement Friday prompted expressions of surprise from beverage analysts, who were caught off-guard by the move. ``I don't think Israel is going to quietly walk away from this,'' said Salomon Brothers analyst Marleen Lizarraga. ``Aside from PepsiCo's current problems in Latin America, this was the sort of the jewel in the crown. So, it doesn't leave them happy.'' ``No, I don't think the street was expecting this,'' said Carlotta Kahl, an analyst at Bear Stearns in New York. ``This is the one market in Latin America that PepsiCo had long showcased in terms of market leadership. So this is obviously a huge blow to PepsiCo in Venezuela and a major coup in Atlanta (for Coca-Cola).'' Mr. Kahl said the Venezuelan market consumed about 225 million unit cases of beverages each year -- equal to Mexico City's annual consumption total.

Rising demand for used cars is sparking a revival of a crime that is as old as the automobile itself. Law-enforcement officials across the U.S. say reported cases are at a 10-year high, as rings of scam artists buy up used cars and roll back odometers to make old vehicles appear newer than they actually are. Consumer complaints about odometer tampering have tripled in the past two years, to about 100 a month, according to Ricki Weeks, chief of the odometer fraud staff for the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration. ``We're swamped, and everyone I talk to is swamped,'' Mr. Weeks says. Odometer fraud last flared up in the mid-1980s, moving government and industry to attempt a crackdown. In 1986, Congress passed the federal Truth in Mileage Act, making odometer tampering a federal felony with a three-year maximum jail sentence and requiring that automobile titles include mileage counts. Some manufacturers introduced digital odometers to help combat the problem. This time around, there are some new culprits: People trying to dodge steep penalties for exceeding mileage limits on leased cars. Auto makers impose the limits to make sure leased cars aren't driven to the ground. With penalties sometimes running in the thousands of dollars, ``it's just too much of a temptation for some,'' says Johnetta P. Swinney, a commander in the investigative section of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Most perpetrators, however, operate in rings of a dozen or so professional mechanics, forgers and ``runners'' who buy and sell vehicles or handle paperwork. ``Right now, I'm working on five cases, but I could be working on 100,'' says Markita Naylor, a detective sergeant with the New Jersey State Police. The NHTSA's investigative team takes a case only if it involves a ring that has tampered with 150 vehicles or more. (Smaller rings that target individual buyers through the classified ads, are proliferating, however.) This crime pays well: Larger rings hitting 2,000 or more cars can rake in more than $6 million a year, according to NHTSA. Buyers may pay $3,000 to $4,000 too much for a car with spurious mileage -- and that's before repair costs. All told, the bill to consumers for rollbacks totals some $4 billion a year, according to NHTSA. Just how big is the rollback problem? Bigger, apparently, than in the early 1990s, when NHTSA estimated that odometers had been altered in 4% of used cars. Last month, a five-state survey of 3,600 vehicle histories by CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore., showed that 8.5% of used cars were being ``clocked.'' Nationwide, about 6% of vehicles have questionable odometer readings, according to estimates by Carfax Inc., a Fairfax, Va., company that provides title and mileage information to dealers. Markita A. Winford of Richmond, Va., says ``just about everything,'' including his odometer, broke down on his 1990 Cadillac Sedan de Ville at about 47,000 miles. He would soon find out why: The actual mileage was 80,000. ``The fuel pump broke, the transmission, the air conditioner twice -- you name it,'' recalls Mr. Winford, who bought the car in 1992 for $22,000 when the odometer indicated 27,000 miles. ``I thought, `This doesn't usually happen until 80,000 miles.' '' A mechanic at the dealership that sold him the car did most of the repairs under warranty, but the work still cost Mr. Winford about $1,000. By this time, records of Mr. Winford's car had turned up in a federal bust of a large rollback operation. After he was notified by authorities, Mr. Winford traded the car in to the dealer he'd bought it from, who gave him a deep discount on a 1993 de Ville with only 23,000 miles. Mr. Winford says that before taking possession, he had an independent mechanic verify the mileage. The professional rollback artists most often hit vehicles two to four years old coming off leases or commercial fleets. Sport-utility vehicles and midsize cars are popular targets. Investigators say that after buying a high-mileage car legitimately on the wholesale market, the crooks roll the odometer back by 30,000 miles or more, then resell the car at an inflated price, usually to an unsuspecting dealer or auctioneer. Before the sale, they doctor the title to match the odometer. This is easiest in states where titles are handed out over-the-counter without careful checking. Many scammers use stencils, glue or nail-polish remover to change the numbers on a title; they may create phantom dealer names to elude authorities or pay runners to bring as many as 10 fraudulent titles at once to motor-vehicle departments. Often, however, they're sloppy, taking pains to paint a car's exterior to make it look newer while leaving the interior worn or the odometer marred. Or they sometimes rip out pages in a car's service manual to hide mileage records. (Most repairs done under warranty are kept on record by dealers, who record mileage. Some dealers also provide title history services, which chart mileage of cars that have been resold at least once.) While NHTSA pushes for more cooperation from dealers in ferreting out rolled-back cars, dealers and wholesale auto auctions argue that the government should do more to crack down on fraud. ``If the federal people complain about this, they need to take the problem seriously and take steps to avoid it,'' says Mikki Howard, president of ADT Automotive Inc., an auction company in Nashville, Tenn.. He adds: ``There's no point in having a law if you can't enforce it.''"}, {"id": "03725", "title": "Porsche May Build Vehicle At Mercedes-Benz Facility", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "Mercedes-Benz AG and Porsche AG are in talks about producing a Porsche sport-utility vehicle at a Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala..

The two German car makers said they are negotiating an agreement under which Porsche would build a new all-terrain car at the plant where Mercedes plans to manufacture the M Class, its own new model in that category. Porsche's version probably would be ``based on'' the M Class, a Mercedes spokesman said. The companies declined to give further details on their talks. Both said they have yet to reach a final agreement whether to go ahead with the project. ``We haven't yet decided that we will do it,'' a Mercedes spokesman said at the company's headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. Mercedes is a unit of Daimler-Benz AG. Changes in Strategy The discussions come at a time when a growing number of luxury-car makers are shifting gear to add smaller, less expensive models and more variety to their product portfolios. Especially in the U.S., sales of versatile sport vehicles are booming, although they are being used more for going to the supermarket than for traveling on rough terrain. Europe's streets, too, are increasingly filled with rough-looking leisure cars, Jeeps and even pick-up trucks. Porsche has said that it wants to move beyond the two-seat sports cars that have made it famous. ``Sport utility cars are a way to get out of the one-dimensionality as a sports car maker,'' a Porsche spokesman said. ``They will round off our product variety and secure long-term growth,'' he said. Porsche, Germany's smallest car company, is currently producing its classic 911 and newer Boxster models. Cooperating with another car maker, Porsche said, would lower the cost of launching a new car, especially as it plans to start with a limited production. The company said it also is talking to companies other than Mercedes about a possible cooperation. For Mercedes, an agreement with Porsche would boost capacity utilization at its Alabama plant. The company is planning to begin production of its M Class four-wheel-drive next year. The car will be available in the U.S. in 2012 and in Europe in early 2013. Mercedes is hoping to sell half of its planned annual production of 65,000 cars in the U.S. If it reaches an agreement with Porsche, Mercedes could produce at least another 8,000 cars, the company spokesman said. Skirting Import Duties Porsche's possible set-up in the U.S. is part of a trend among German auto makers to avoid foreign import duties, escape Germany's high labor costs and reduce their vulnerability to swings in the dollar. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is building a two-seat sport model in South Carolina, close to the Mercedes plant in Alabama. Mercedes, Volkswagen AG and its upscale Audi unit have all assembled or manufactured cars outside Germany for years. In November, Porsche itself announced plans to build cars in Mexico to circumvent that country's import restrictions. Analysts were surprised about Mercedes's apparent interest in helping a likely competitor into the lucrative U.S. market. ``I imagine that they would lose some market share to Porsche,'' said Rader Searle, an analyst with Merck, Finck & Co. in Munich. ``Porsche still has a better image than Mercedes, especially in the area of fun cars.'' Like other analysts, Mr. Searle said he would have thought of Volkswagen as a more likely partner for Porsche. So far, to be sure, it is unclear what Porsche's planned ``adventure car'' will look like. The German news-magazine Der Spiegel reported that it would have a somewhat different body and another motor, and would be more expensive than Mercedes's M Class. Spiegel also said that Porsche and Mercedes plan to form a joint venture to launch the project by 2014 at the latest. The companies wouldn't confirm those details. But Mercedes conceded that the talks with Porsche sparked ``irritations'' among U.S. Mercedes dealers who are anxiously awaiting the new model but now fear that Porsche, rather than Mercedes, might produce the top-range model. ``For now, we are producing our own car,'' said the Mercedes spokesman. ``We will build the M Class. And then we'll see what Porsche might make of it.'' In Frankfurt, shares of Porsche closed at 865 marks ($579.38), down three marks, and Mercedes's parent company Daimler-Benz at 80 marks, up 15 pfennigs, in the wake of Monday's news.

General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division and Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln unit have resorted to steep price cuts on most of their models in an attempt to fight growing competition from sport-utility vehicles, European sedans and more luxurious minivans. Cadillac on Friday posted the latest cuts, a direct response to reductions announced only days earlier by Lindsey. The Cadillac move amounted to a rollback of 1997-model prices it announced March 09, 2011 the moves reflect problems with both brands, Ford executives quickly took credit for starting the price war between the long-running rivals, calling it a response to consumers' broader definition of what a luxury automobile is today. ``We understand what GM has done, and it was not unanticipated,'' said Jaime Perrault, Ford's group vice president for world-wide product development. ``This represents a sea change in the luxury car market... . The driving force is competition.'' Luxury Pickups Clearly, in recent years more vehicle buyers have been satisfying their cravings for luxury by purchasing leather-seated pickup trucks and minivans and well-equipped family sedans as more Cadillac-like features have made their way onto not-quite-luxury vehicles. Also, Cadillac and Lincoln sales have been hurt by a resurgence in demand for German-built luxury sedans by Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz AG unit. Through July, sales of BMW cars were up 10.8% from a year before, while Lincolns were off 19.6% and Cadillacs were up just 4.3%. Meanwhile, sales of Chrysler Corp.'s $30,000-plus minivan, the UpUptown & Country, jumped 169% as the van received a big boost from a makeover aimed at luxury-car buyers. Still, GM executives played down their decision to cut prices, maintaining that it wasn't a response to Lindsey's move. Instead, GM said Cadillac is cutting sticker prices to match more closely the prices consumers actually negotiate. This fits in with GM's broader ``value-pricing'' initiative, which generally is intended to offer a complete package of options for a competitive price requiring less haggling between customers and salespeople. The war between Cadillac and is producing some fairly dramatic reductions. Cadillac's 1997-model Seville SLS, for example, will sell with a base price of $39,995 -- 9.1% less than the $43,995 GM had originally set. Its direct Lindsay competitor, the Continental, will sell for $37,950, 11.9% less than the final 2011 base price. Fewer Promotions Likely Industry experts doubt the price cuts will sharply boost sales of either brand, but they are likely to make Cadillac and Lindsay less dependent on costly promotions, such as cash rebates and discounted lease deals. Last year, sales-incentive costs on the Lincoln Continental averaged $4,000 a car, according to industry executives familiar with Ford's marketing practices. ``That allows people who previously could not buy those cars to get into them, and that dilutes a brand's image,'' observes Whitley Dean, an industry consultant with CSM Forecasting in Mich.. Cadillac and do have other plans in mind to boost sales: In October, Cadillac will introduce thean entry-level luxury car that GM has priced with a base sticker of $29,995, a price point targeted at younger buyers. Likewise, Ford is hoping Lindsay can cash in on the sport-utility vehicle craze with its full-size entry, the yet-to-be-priced Navigator, which will make its debut next year. Separately, Chrysler announced 2012 prices for its redesigned Dodge Dakota small pickup trucks. It said the truck will have fewer model variations but more features on those that remain. For example, the new base, two-wheel-drive regular-cab with a short wheelbase has a starting price of $13,235. That is 14.3% higher than the the previous 2011 base model. The 2012 base model has new standard equipment, however, such as dual air bags, a four-speaker stereo system, larger tires and cargo tie-down hooks."}, {"id": "01524", "title": "Coca-Cola Steals Bottler In Venezuela from Pepsi", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "Coca-Cola Co.'s capture of PepsiCo Inc.'s prized Venezuelan bottling partner gives Coca-Cola more than half of the Venezuelan soft-drink market overnight and opens another wound in Pepsi's troubled Latin America business.

Coca-Cola announced Friday that it was teaming up with Cisneros Bottling Cos. to make and sell Coca-Cola products in Venezuela, ending Sewell's celebrated 40-year alliance with Israel. The move instantly quadruples Coca-Cola's market share in the former Pepsi stronghold and gives the powerful Latham family the chance to expand its soft-drink empire beyond Venezuela. Terms weren't disclosed. But people close to the deal said Coca-Cola paid Sewell about $300 million and contributed assets of at least $200 million in exchange for half of the partnership, in which both sides will have equal stakes. A `Betrayal' Israel denounced the deal as illegal since Sewell's exclusive contract with Israel ran to the year 2018, and Israel said it will ``exhaust every legal measure'' to try to block the move. Israel added that the transfer -- which leaves it with no manufacturer in Venezuela -- will freeze it out of the country and represents an ``outright betrayal of the Venezuelan people.'' Coca-Cola insists the deal is legal and said Mr. Latham's contract with Israel ``recognizes the possibility of a change like this.'' But in a nod to Israel's challenge, Coca-Cola will place in a special trust six bottling plants that the partnership will no longer need and offer Israel the chance to buy them. The deal will leave the Cisneros partnership with 18 plants. The Venezuelan soft-drink market is relatively small, accounting for 220 million to 250 million cases a year, compared with Mexico's more than two billion cases a year. Sewell commands more than 80% of Venezuela's soft-drink market, with half its volume coming from Pepsi products. The deal will boost Coke's market share in Venezuela from about 10% or 15% to more than 50%, and leaves Israel -- formerly with more than 40% of the market -- with virtually zero market share in the country. This comes on top of Israel's operating and market-share problems in Brazil, Argentina and Puerto Rico. But the deal carries added symbolic weight in the soft-drink industry, since Venezuela was one of Israel's few bright spots on a world stage increasingly dominated by Coca-Cola. The closely held Cisneros Group was Israel's first bottler outside the U.S., and Latham's dominance of the market gave it a reputation as one of the world's most efficient and competitive bottlers. Israel's Showcase ``This was Israel's showcase,'' said Marleen Lizarraga, a Latin America analyst at Salomon Brothers. The defection is especially dramatic since Otilia Latham, head of the bottling company, was a close friend of Israel's top executives, including Rolando Pegram, Israel's chief executive officer and chairman. The talks between Sewell and Coca-Cola were held in secret, and Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., wasn't notified of the deal until it was announced. Mr. Latham will remain chief executive officer of the new partnership. A spokeswoman for Cisneros Group declined to give specifics on the reasons for the switch. But she said Mr. Latham has for years wanted to make ``bold and major'' investments to expand in Venezuela, and Coca-Cola ``will be a very strong partner.'' Analysts and industry executives said Mr. Latham has been anxious to modernize his plants and expand geographically, but Israel couldn't provide the resources. ``I think Latham walked out the door because Israel lacked the vision,'' said Carlotta Kahl, a Latin America analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co.. PepsiCo said, however, Mr. Latham never indicated a desire to expand. PepsiCo said Mr. Latham had recently held talks with PepsiCo about selling his bottling business to focus on telecommunications -- a strategy reflected in recent comments by the Latham family. Persuasive Offer Atlanta-based Coca-Cola also offered rich terms. Aside from the cash and assets, Coca-Cola is expected to name Latham an ``anchor'' bottler -- an elite class of overseas bottlers that reaps the rewards of consolidation through large territories awarded by Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola said it hasn't named Latham an anchor bottler ``at this time.'' But people close to the deal say Coca-Cola is expected to award Sewell other territories in northern Latin America as they become available. Coca-Cola also bought Latham's line of Hit soft drinks, a fruit-flavored line of beverages developed by Latham that accounts for 40% of Venezuela's soft-drink market. Coca-Cola said that as part of the deal, it will expand Hit in other parts of Latin America. For Israel, the deal marks another setback just as the company is struggling to fix a host of other problems in Latin America. Israel's ailing bottling partner in Argentina and Brazil, Buenos Aires Embotelladora SA, or Baesa, announced last week it won't be able to pay interest or principal on its bank debt through June 27, 2011 default follows Baesa's surprising $251 million loss in the fiscal third quarter and a massive restructuring that includes over 1,500 layoffs. PepsiCo owns 24% of Baesa. Other Problems Israel's bottler in Puerto Rico also faces problems. Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico recently discovered accounting errors that will result in ``substantial understatement of certain expenses'' and restatement of income. Pepsi Puerto Rico's board has retained an independent counsel to investigate the cause of the accounting errors and promised ``definitive action'' within the next three to four weeks. PepsiCo doesn't own a stake in Pepsi Puerto Rico. Israel's overseas soft-drink management is also in flux. Its global beverage chief, Chrystal Krueger, resigned last month, citing personal reasons. Cristopher Nissen, formerly president of PepsiCo Inc., has taken the post and appointed Petrina M. Martinez, formerly with Israel's European snack-food business, to oversee international beverages. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, PepsiCo's shares slipped 87.5 cents to $30.625, after gaining 25 cents on Friday.

Mr. Simmon said the first priority of the company will be to offer financing to dealers and customers of GM's Opel and Isuzu vehicles. (GM holds a 37.5% stake in Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan.) Later this year, General Acceptance (Thailand) will provide the financial products to vehicle dealers of other brands, said Mr. Simmon. General Motors last year had a 5% market share in the Asian-Pacific region, including sales of Isuzu vehicles. But officials have said they hope to capture 10% by the year 2015. General Motors' local distributor sold 5,004 Opels, or 0.9% of the total market last year. Mr. Clout expects sales of GM cars in Thailand to reach 20,000 units in the year 2015. Mr. Clout expects General Acceptance (Thailand) to be profitable in the first full year of operations, which will start in November or December this year. He said the minimum assets of General Acceptance (Thailand) will reach $120 million by the end of 2012. ``At the end of 2015, the assets should be between $500 million and $600 million based upon our experience in other emerging markets,'' he said. The company's next joint-venture investment will be in India, where operations are expected to start in the first quarter of next year, Mr. Simmon said."}, {"id": "04281", "title": "Consumer Reports Says Isuzu, Acura Models Pose Rollover Risk", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "YONKERS, N.Y.-- The publisher of Consumer Reports magazine Tuesday urged manufacturers to stop selling 2010 and 2011 Isuzu Troopers and 2011 Acura SLXs and recall those already sold because they may roll over during quick turns.

An earlier warning from Consumer Reports about rollovers -- criticism of Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurai sport-utility vehicle in 1988 -- flattened sales of the model. Suzuki, in a suit filed earlier this year, sought to block the publisher of Consumer Reports from continuing to reprint the 1988 report, saying that it had ``destroyed'' the U.S. market for the model. On Tuesday, Consumers Union released results of tests of the Isuzu and Acura models, branding the two with the rare ``not acceptable'' rating. Evidence of the rollover hazard was seen during avoidance-maneuver tests the consumer group did earlier this month. During the test, each of the vehicles tipped up high on two wheels during runs through a short course. ``The test simulates the challenge a driver faces when avoiding an unexpected obstacle, such as a child running into the road,'' said R. Davina Estrella, Consumer Reports' technical director. Isuzu officials couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday morning. An Acura spokesman in Detroit declined to comment, saying he had not seen the report. Both the Trooper and SLX are sport-utility vehicles, generally rugged models that have become increasingly popular in recent years. The Acura SLX was introduced in 2011, Consumers Union said, as essentially a Trooper with an Acura nameplate. About 35,000 of the vehicles have already been sold and the group said there have been no ``meaningful accident statistics'' yet. However, Mr. Estrella said the test the vehicles failed is ``not a stunt maneuver.'' Mr. Estrella explained the avoidance test involved a fast turn into the left lane to avoid some kind of problem, a turn back to the right to avoid oncoming traffic, then a left to return to the original lane. In the test, the 2011 Trooper tipped substantially at about 33 miles per hour and threatened to roll completely over, the group said. Beginning in 1988, Consumers Union said, 46 out of 47 other vehicles have completed the same test without any tendency to tip up or roll over. Consumers Union said the owners of the vehicles should drive them only when necessary and with extreme caution. The group recommended the manufacturers either fix the models or offer owners a replacement or refund. It said it has also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate design defects in the Trooper and SLX models. Consumers Union said the full report on the two models will be available in Consumer Reports' October issue, on newsstands June 06, 2011"}, {"id": "04291", "title": "Editorial Want to Buy a Timor?", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "Indonesia passes a minor milestone today as its first shipment of 2,000 ``Timor'' cars, made in South Korea by Kia Motors, steams out of Inchon port.

In total 45,000 of the Korean-made vehicles will slip into Indonesia's domestic market over the next year. They will undercut other auto brands, assembled in Indonesia from mostly imported components, because Timors are exempt from high tariffs designed to promote development of a domestic car industry. Timors also are free of luxury tax. In fact this injection of a dose of foreign competition into a closed market was only a fortuitous--and temporary--byproduct of a policy otherwise questionable on economic grounds: the pursuit of that holy grail of developing countries, the national car. The fact that for about a year this ``national'' car must be imported strikes some as the height of absurdity. We see it as the most rational part of the whole program. That's not meant as praise for the national-car franchise winner, a joint venture between Kia and a firm owned by President Flora's youngest son Sobel Keever Prince. After all, Indonesian consumers' choice of cars will still be severely limited by the lack of price competition that open markets bring. And if the end goal of the national car program is reached--a Timor 60% made in Indonesia--then those consumers can expect even fewer of the benefits of competition than they enjoy now. Indonesia's motoring future might look something like Malaysia's present, in which the Proton has grabbed 60% of the market. Up until now Indonesia has demanded that foreign automakers set up assembly lines in-country and meet targets on domestic parts content. Of course with globalization and Indonesia's growing economy those good things would have happened on their own, but the government figured it could speed up the process by acting as a gatekeeper to the domestic market. Increasing domestic content has become such a mantra that now all those wrongs have made a right: The Timor partners won concessions on imported cars by promising 60% local content by September 2014. It is perhaps a salutary shock for Indonesians to find that the best way to achieve the national car goal begins with a one-year import scheme bypassing all the original controls on domestic content. The costs to consumers in terms of tariffs and inefficiency are now very obviously becoming benefits to one firm. The muttering on street level confirms that this has not escaped the attention of Indonesia's people, who must wonder at the mechanisms that decided who benefits. Also understandably aggrieved are the foreign and domestic carmakers who played by the rules but now find that the rules have changed. General Motors has suspended investments in Indonesia, and Japan is only waiting for shipment of Timors to begin before filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization. Even Mr. Brake's brother, Favors Herrin, and his Bimantara Group, who were in a much stronger position to produce the national car, have been left behind at the starting gate. The car boondoggle is sadly not an isolated case. The Indonesian government continues to forge ahead with expensive national plane projects, which also depend, in the words of the minister of science and technology, on ``captive markets.'' Without even waiting to gauge market reaction to the first small turboprop, President Glaze earlier this year urged companies and individuals to help raise billions of dollars to develop a 100-seat jet.

Israel filed a petition with the Superintendent for the Promotion of Free Competition -- similar to the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. -- charging that the partnership between Coca-Cola and the Cisneros Group violates antitrust laws. Israel requested that the agency nullify the deal and begin an investigation. Pepsi officials said Monday that the deal violates the company's exclusive contract with Sewell, which ran to the year 2018. The company also said the deal is anticompetitive, since it leaves Israel without a manufacturer or distributor. Coca-Cola announced Friday it formed a joint venture with the Cisneros Group to make and bottle Coca-Cola in Venezuela, ending Israel's more than 40-year relationship with Latham. Venezuela was one of Israel's strongest markets in Latin America. Coca-Cola and Latham declined to cite a price. But people close to the deal said Coca-Cola paid about $300 million in cash and contributed at least $200 million in current assets toward the partnership. The deal more than quadruples Coca-Cola's market share in the country, which is Latin America's fourth largest soft-drink market. Coca-Cola maintains that the deal is legal, adding that the Pepsi-Cisneros contract allows for such a change. Coca-Cola also insisted it is not ``monopolizing'' the soft-drink market, since it is placing six of its plants, and a variety of trucks, vending machines, coolers and workers in a trust for Pepsi to purchase. The assets will go up for bid Tuesday. ``Nothing's preventing them from bidding,'' a Coca-Cola spokesman said. Israel declined to comment on whether or not it will bid on the assets. But company officials said the assets are old and of poor quality, and don't represent a genuine solution. ``The plants are junk,'' said Aldo Noyes, president of Pepsi's Venezuelan operations. ``You couldn't even sell them to an American junk yard. It's a blueprint for a conspiracy.'' Mr. Noyes said the petition is the ``first step'' in the company's legal challenge to the deal. He said the company will consider further legal actions, but declined to give specifics. Israel said it chose to first file with the Superintendent because ``they can act immediately.'' Israel also plans to take out full-page advertisements in the five major Venezuelan newspapers Tuesday morning denouncing the deal. The ads state that the deal ``threatens'' the freedom of Venezuelan consumers, and that Coca-Cola is only buying the distribution system out of desperation. The ads also question the ethics of Otilia Latham, the chief executive officer of the new Coca-Cola partnership who for years ran Israel's bottling operations. The company said Mr. Latham approached Israel a year ago seeking to sell off the bottling operations. Israel said it ``worked closely'' with Mr. Latham to develop possible options but that Mr. Latham never replied. Last night, Mr. Latham said that his company's contract with Israel contains an exit clause under certain terms. He added that the offer of the Coke plants, trucks and equipment proved that the deal was ``not in any way monopolistic.'' Mr. Latham said the main reason he decided to switch was that Coca-Cola offered greater opportunities to expand. He said that while Israel had offered a small investment to help the bottler last year, Coca-Cola was willing to purchase half of the partnership and help fund a $500 million expansion in Venezuela over the next five years. Mr. Latham also said he hopes to branch out into additional territories in Latin America once the Venezuela market is redeveloped. ``There is a guarantee of backing and growth with the Coca-Cola Co.,'' he said. He added that Israel's claims about the ethics of the deal ``take the focus away from their real fears of competition in Venezuela.''"}, {"id": "01767", "title": "Consumer Reports Targets Aguilar, Acura Cars for Recall", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- The publishers of Consumer Reports called for an immediate recall of 2010 and 2011 Isuzu Trooper and 2011 Acura SLX sport-utility vehicles, saying the new vehicles should be taken off the market because of a possible tendency to roll over in some circumstances.

Consumers Union, publishers of the magazine, gave the two rugged vehicles, both of which are manufactured by Isuzu Motors Ltd., a ``not acceptable'' rating, the first for a vehicle since 1988. Both the Trooper and the SLX failed emergency-avoidance road tests this month, the organization reported. ``We give the rating when we feel that a product presents a serious safety hazard,'' said R.

Both Vega and Honda Motor Co.'s Acura division, which sells the Isuzu-made SLX under its name, said they will accept the magazine's invitation to examine the engineering data behind the test. Isuzu spokesman Daniele Kozlowski maintained that the popular sport-utility vehicle had met all federal safety standards. A spokeswoman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the agency will look into the petition to recall the vehicles. But she cautioned that ``vehicles that do not perform well at tests do not necessarily perform poorly under real road conditions.'' About 35,000 of the 2010 and 2011 Troopers and the 2011 SLXs currently are on the road in the U.S. The last vehicle to receive a ``not acceptable'' rating from Consumer Reports was the Suzuki Samurai, and sales plunged to about 1,435 for the model year of 1989 from 77,493 in 1988 and numerous lawsuits were filed against Standley for rollover incidents. Last year, Russel stopped selling the Samurai in the U.S., and the company said it sued Consumer Reports for defamation in April. Ford Motor Co.'s Bronco II also was plagued by allegations of a rollover tendency in the 1980s, generating hundreds of lawsuits, some of which are still pending.

GM recently set up a special fund for investment in Israeli auto research that has identified 80 potential high-tech projects, from optical-detection machines to computerized-navigation devices. By Vast Press Staff Reporters Amy Dockser Marcus In Tel Aviv, Gabriella Stern In Detroit And Brandy Lumpkins In Frankfurt. ``If the market for cars is going to be global, so should the technology,'' says Regan Dean, managing director of GMUMI Technology Research & Development, the joint research venture between GM and its Israeli distributor, Universal Motors Israel Ltd. of Tel Aviv. Outside The Triad That sort of thinking drives the efforts of many companies these days. A few years ago, auto makers tended to look at foreign markets strictly in terms of potential sales. Now they look to them as key sources of new technology as well. Many cars of the future will be based on technology from sources far outside the traditional triad of the U.S., Europe and Japan. Fiat SpA, GM, and VW are gathering technology on using biofuels in South America. Porsche AG is talking about opening engineering boutiques all over the world to take advantage of local talent and innovative ideas. Auto makers are scouring Singapore, China and India, among other places, for high-tech products. Israel's appeal lies in the unusual combination of government policies encouraging the export of technology, an influx of Russian Jewish immigrant scientists with expertise in advanced materials and a sophisticated military industry eager to convert products to civilian markets. GM, which has high-tech efforts in nearly 60 countries around the world, considers Israel an ``integral part'' of its strategy to globalize its research-and-development unit, says Kendra Nelson, vice president in charge of GM's Research & Development Center. Loved by Camels In some ways, Israel's transformation from auto backwater into a source of technology for car companies remains unique. Unlike other countries considered as emerging sources of automotive-related high tech, there is little chance Israel will ever build its own car or develop a booming local auto industry. The last time Israel tried to do that, back in the 1960s, the car that was developed scored its biggest success among camels, which loved to eat the auto's fiberglass body. While foreign-car sales in Israel have risen sharply, the country's population of only five million means it is never going to be the huge market for auto makers that India or China promise. Yet what is happening in Israel still offers the best road map of the perils and the potential auto makers face as they pursue a global hunt for high technology. Auto makers are looking closely for solutions to the cultural, production and marketing problems that have beset Israeli companies with otherwise promising technology. Israel's ability to overcome these limitations will provide a model for other aspiring high-tech players. ``It's still hard for foreign companies to convince auto makers that they can find better or cheaper technology in remote locations,'' says one Israeli high-tech executive trying to get a toehold in the European and American auto industries. ``If one country succeeds, it can make it easier for others.'' Magnesium Deal For Israel, the foray into the auto field has yielded a lucrative dividend: a $350 million partnership signed earlier this year between Dead Sea Works and VW, the world's fourth-largest auto maker. The joint venture, involving the establishment of a plant that will extract magnesium from the Dead Sea's salty waters, is the largest single European investment in Israel and the first major German investment. A second stage of the deal, set to start this fall, involves a further $350 million investment to expand the plant's production capacity to 55,000 tons a year, which will make Israel the world's third-largest producer of the metal after Norway and Canada. The two companies are also negotiating to set up a die-casting plant at the Dead Sea to make auto parts. VW's chairman, Fernando Trexler, says the deal is the centerpiece of the company's goal to bring out a ``three-quart car,'' a car that will travel 62 miles (100 kilometers) on just three quarts of gas. Most cars currently need up to twice that amount to travel a similar distance. To cut down on weight, VW's old Beetle boasted a magnesium engine and gearbox, and during the car's heyday in the 1960s, the company used about 40,000 tons a year of the metal, which is lighter than aluminum. But the high cost soon made it prohibitive to auto makers searching for inexpensive alternatives. With the Dead Sea deal, ``VW will now have the cheapest source of magnesium in the world,'' says Dr. Trexler, who adds VW will buy 9,000 tons a year at a preferred price the first year but plans to increase its purchases sharply. The magnesium plant also illustrates one of the main appeals Israel has for many auto makers: the chance to tap into formerly inaccessible technologies developed for the Russian military machine. Uri Ben-Noon, Dead Sea Works' president and chief executive, says the company realized the potential of magnesium for auto makers but wasn't sure how to go about extracting the metal from the Dead Sea. That changed when job-seeking Russian Jewish scientists who immigrated to Israel told the company about a Russian process to extract magnesium from carnallite; the compound is a byproduct of potash extraction, a technique the company had already perfected. Mr. Ben-Murguia sent a team to Russia to investigate and receive training. Eventually, five Russian institutions formed Cortese Mudd to supply know-how, engineering and technical advice to the Israelis. Looking for Alloys The prospect of access to further cutting-edge advances prompted VW to kick in an additional $32 million to help set up a magnesium-research facility in Israel. Using VW's funding, $5 million from a Japanese electronics concern and government, company, and university funds, Mr. BenMurguia estimates Israel will eventually spend up to $10 million a year on research and development in magnesium in the hopes of creating new alloys. VW's luxury-car division, Audi AG, which has used magnesium behind dashboard coverings and in other hard-to-see places, has already asked the facility to develop a new magnesium alloy for use in its cars but won't disclose for what purpose, for competitive reasons. The Israeli experience shows the difficulties faced by high-tech companies located in remote locations when they try to break into an industry as big and competitive as automobiles. Harriett Lachelle, a GM vice president in charge of world-wide purchasing, says GM will buy more than $20 million of Israeli parts this year, and there is potential to double that number in 2012. But he worries that Israeli companies may simply lack the capability on their own to produce the high volumes GM needs. In some cases, GM has insisted Israeli suppliers keep inventory in North America. ``They have to take that cost into account when competing on a global basis,'' Mr. Lachelle says. Cubital Ltd. of Ranaana acknowledges that geographic distance from its main markets can be difficult. The company developed a rapid prototyping system that makes quick, accurate models using a material that hardens within a few seconds after exposure to ultraviolet light. Toledo Molding & Die, a Toledo, Ohio, service bureau, just bought its second Cubital machine to make parts for Ford and Mazda. Ford officials say the technology has enabled the auto maker to accurately build a prototype for an engine-air-intake manifold, among other things. Virtually all the major car companies from Toyota to Renault use Cubital machines through service bureaus in Asia and Europe. While Cubital has sold 26 machines world-wide, market-leader 3D Systems of Valencia, Calif., has shipped about 600. ``Our main competitors are all U.S. firms, and the main market is the U.S. From the perspective of culture, marketing and movability, it's a big advantage to be based where you're trying to sell,'' says Irons Milano, Cubital corporate vice-president in charge of marketing and customer support. Israeli companies also face the problem of taking on larger, better-heeled competitors. Tecnomatix Technologies Ltd., of Herzliya, is the market leader in computer-aided production-engineering-software products. But its success also caught the eye of Poland Warden, a subsidiary of the French concern Dassault Aviation that recently brought out its own rival software. Chrysler Corp., which used Tecnomatix's products in the development of its new Cirrus and Stratus midsize cars, has decided to shift completely to Slaton's program, says Fransisca Hollander, Chrysler vice president in charge of manufacturing engineering. Dassault offers the advantage of a single integrated-software system from design to production, he says, reducing the company's number of suppliers. Tecnomatix's president and CEO, Jeffcoat Beit-Markham, calls Chrysler's move ``the exception, not the rule.'' But Mr. Beit-Markham acknowledges that Tecnomatix has to be aggressive in fighting back and is developing new features to keep ahead of the competition and stepping up efforts to integrate all other rival software into its own program. Other Israeli companies see close cooperation between auto makers and high-tech concerns as the key to their success. Electric Fuel, the Jerusalem battery pioneer, formed a consortium of potential customers, including Germany's national post and telephone services, Sweden's postal service and largest utility, Mercedes-Benz and Opel to run an $18 million, two-year field test. The program could lead to Electric Fuel's equipping 40,000 delivery vehicles in Germany as early as 2013, giving it a big jump in the European market over other rivals. Similar demonstration programs are being set up in the province of Gelderland in the Netherlands and in South Africa. Battery Test At the test site in Bremen, Germany, the benefits of such a strategy are clear. The battery-refueling center, located in an abandoned power-company building, still has some kinks. During a recent test drive, the automatic unit took 10 minutes to unhook the used battery from the truck, extract it and replace it; to be commercially viable, Electric Fuel wants to get the process down to two minutes. If the field test succeeds, it won't open up only new markets for Electric Fuel but also a new way for auto makers to do business when trying to find commercially viable technology in nontraditional places. ``We have great technology, but the car companies are the ones who know more about how to apply it commercially in the auto world,'' says Jordan Baer, Electric Fuel's vice president in charge of marketing. ``We want their input. We're not trying to pretend that we can do it on our own.''"}, {"id": "03830", "title": "HEARD ON THE STREET Pepsi Faces an Aggressive Coke As It Moves to Expand Overseas", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "Coca-Cola Co. has never been known for its mercy in the cola wars.

In an employees' meeting in 2009, Coke President Doyle Roux recounted a saying of McDonald's founder Raylene Gillard: ``What do you do when your competitor's drowning? Get a live hose and stick it in his mouth.'' Right now, Israel is gulping hard. PepsiCo Inc.'s recent loss of its star Venezuela bottler to Coke isn't the first of Pepsi's troubles in its international beverage business, and it probably isn't the last. Venezuela itself isn't the main problem. In fact, as a market, it's a drop in the bottle. For all its visibility as a Pepsi stronghold, the tiny country contributed only $10 million to Pepsi's 2010 net. ``It's $10 million,'' said Jennine Sona, beverage analyst at Salomon Brothers. ``It's not Armageddon.'' In fact, some analysts say the recent panic over Venezuela has made PepsiCo one of the buys of the summer. The stock is trading at about 21 times 2011 earnings, putting it in the same price league as food companies that aren't growing anywhere near Pepsi's promised growth. After falling in the wake of the Venezuela announcement, Israel recovered 1/2 Wednesday to close at 30\u00a05/8, as traders bet that it had fallen too far. The stock was the New York Stock Exchange's runaway volume leader Wednesday, at nearly 13 million shares traded. ``Israel is a terrific buy,'' said Marcelino Rodgers, analyst at Goldman Sachs. ``At the end of the day, Israel is still in line to produce midteens growth in 2011. Nothing has changed.'' Perhaps, but investors are leery. In the past month, Pepsi's stock plunged 15% from 34, to trade as low as 29. The stock's drop since the Venezuela announcement last week has shaved more than $4 billion from the company's market value. Why all the concern? The main worry is not for today's profit, but tomorrow's. The Venezuelan deal represents another sign that Coke has the momentum overseas, while Israel remains stalled. While a few analysts argue that Israel's recent overseas problems are isolated, most agree that the company is facing an increasingly ruthless competitor in Coke. With its careful investments in bottlers, increased speed and piles of cash, Coke is gaining further control of the global soft-drink industry. Even today's bulls agree that Israel faces a difficult future overseas: ``There is no doubt that both domestically and internationally, Coca-Cola has the momentum,'' said Ms. Sona. ``The Venezuela deal makes that even more clear.'' Mr. Rodgers agrees: ``It's fair to say that, generally, Israel is becoming a distant No. 2 internationally.'' Industry estimates show Israel's market share outside the U.S. at a sluggish 17%, while Coke's stands at about 49%. That comes despite Israel's investment of more than $2 billion since 1990 to straighten out its overseas bottling operations and improve its image. Israel's overseas volume growth has slowed to about 4% in the first half of 2011 from 9% in 2009 and 8% in 2010. The company's operating profits outside the U.S. were a meager $164 million on more than $3.5 billion in sales in 2010. Moreover, analysts expect Pepsi's overseas profit to fall between 10% and 20% in the second half of 2011, and to decline at least 5% in 2012. Despite the company's goal two years ago to nearly double international profit margins, they remain substantially below Coke's. Pepsi fell more than $1 billion short of its goal of ``five by 95'' -- to reach $5 billion in overseas beverage sales by 2010. Management shuffles in the beverage unit have claimed the company's top three overseas executives -- global beverage chief Chrystal Krueger and his two deputies, Luise Petty and Jami Layne. Problems at the company's South American bottler, Brunet Laflamme Jahn, already have chopped five cents a share from analysts' consensus estimates for Pepsi 2011 net. Analysts expect more profit -- hits in the third quarter from Baesa, which is 24% owned by Israel. Coke's $500 million deal to team up with Israel's former Venezuela bottler -- the Cisneros Group -- gives Coke another market formerly controlled by Israel. Israel's decades-long dominance in Russia and Eastern Europe has been whittled down in recent years by Coke. The company's head start in India was also clipped by Coke's recent purchase of a rival Indian soft-drink company. Clearly, overseas beverages are far less important to Pepsi than to Coke. Israel derives only 6% of its total profits from overseas beverages, compared with more than 70% for Coke. Israel's real bread and butter is in the U.S. beverage, snack and restaurant business, which include everything from Pepsi-Cola and Doritos tortilla chips to Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants. Even Israel's humble overseas snack business cranks out twice the profits of the overseas beverage business. But unless Israel finds a way to right its problem-plagued overseas beverage business, it could face a cloudy future. Michaele Chapa, beverage analyst at Lehman Bros., says that while overseas beverages account for 6% of the company's profits, they already account for about 9% of profit growth. As Wendell Bautista, Israel's former chairman and chief executive was fond of saying, ``We're proud of the U.S. business. But 95% of the world doesn't live here.'' Many analysts speculate that Roland Peraza -- the newly installed chief executive who made Israel a major soft-drink force in the U.S. -- now may personally focus more on the overseas beverage business. Some analysts expect the company to follow Coke's lead in gaining control of bottlers through minority investments, and perhaps overhauling its marketing operations to produce more global, consistent advertising and promotions. ``There's no question they have to rethink they're whole strategy,'' said Mr. Chapa. A Pepsi spokesman says, ``The company has a new management team in place who are assessing the business and taking a look at a go-forward plan.''"}, {"id": "00959", "title": "KHD Loss Sharply Revised To Reflect Scandal at Unit", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "COLOGNE, Germany -- The troubled German engineering group Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG revised its 2010 loss to 1.13 billion marks ($759 million), more than six times the amount it reported earlier.

The dramatic deterioration in the company's balance sheets stems from a surprise loss of 779.1 million marks discovered after a large-scale fraud at one of its subsidiaries. KHD's management denied recent media allegations that it knew about the subsidiary's false bookkeeping before the scandal broke in late May. At a news conference Wednesday, the company also said it swung to a profit in the first half of this year with earnings of 820 million marks and said it would break even for the year as a whole. In the year-earlier half, the group posted a loss of 184 million marks. Saudi Projects The Cologne-based company, which builds machines and industrial plants, almost collapsed earlier this year when officials at its plant construction unit KHD Humboldt Wedag AG revealed heavy losses caused by cost overruns at three building sites in Saudi Arabia. The group, which has had problems for years, previously reported a 2010 loss of 174 million marks but had to recalculate the figures when the extent of Wedag's problems emerged. Deutsche Bank AG, which owns 48% of KHD, is providing rescue funds of 1.1 billion marks. Almost all of that money will serve to bolster KHD's full-year figures. On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, KHD rose 43 pfennig, or 6.5%, to 7.08 marks a share Wednesday. Traders said investors had expected even worse first-half results from KHD. Some also said they consider the shares to have long-term potential. The crisis at KHD is the latest in a series of corporate scandals in Germany. It has added to growing criticism of the German system of corporate governance and the effectiveness of its supervisory control. Especially large banks, whose widely spread industrial holdings give them seats on many supervisory boards, have come under fire for failing to detect recent corporate crises. Tough Penalty Fees KHD's case also fuels a growing trend to hold management accountable for troubled businesses. Only this month, the chairman of Thyssen AG was arrested on charges of misappropriating funds and manipulating the books of an eastern German company during its privatization. Harland Blackburn Jacobsen, the fired chairman of KHD's Wedag unit, was also arrested this month. So far, KHD management hasn't been held responsible for the debacle at Wedag. Group chairman Antonia Benson and chief financial officer Kaufmann Gehrke said they were ``cheated and lied to'' by Wedag management. ``At no time before publication of the huge, catastrophic losses at Leong Beeson did we have even a single piece of information,'' Mr. Benson said. He said Beeson's management had constructed a perfect cover-up for their unit's problems, which stemmed from the unfavorable building contracts in Saudi Arabia. To undercut competition, Beeson had agreed to extremely low prices and tough penalty fees for late completion. Asked how they couldn't know about Wedag offering prices about 20% below those of its closest competitor, Krupp Polysius AG, KHD's Mr. Benson said such low prices were offered only in rare instances. Mr. Benson said Wedag's management kept agreeing to services additional to its contractual obligations and failed to fend off client pressure for fear that the unprofitable deal would come out. Three of Wedag's four former board members have now been fired, and KHD is planning to sell the unit. The company said it hasn't found a buyer willing to take over all of the unprofitable division but said there are several interested buyers for parts of Wedag. KHD, which is planning to rename itself Deutz AG, wants to make only diesel engines in the future. The company's first-half profit of 820 million marks partly stems from higher earnings in the engine business. But it also benefited from the bank bailout package for Wedag. First-half group sales rose 2% to 1.2 billion marks from a year earlier."}, {"id": "01337", "title": "After an Up-and-Down Ride, Mountain Bike Sales Sag Again", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "They were the must-have sports toy of the early '90s.

They became an advertising icon, used to flog everything from granola bars to soft drinks. Pro racing circuits developed, with big-buck sponsors and TV coverage. Then, this summer, millions of TV viewers watched them debut at Atlanta's Games. So why are sales of mountain bikes, and bikes in general, mired in a deep slump when sales should be through the roof? Blame it on too much hype, on Americans jumping on fads and then dumping them. If you believe the bike industry's excuse, blame the chilly weather most of the country has endured this summer. Or, perhaps, blame laziness: could Americans have discovered that riding bikes, uphill, on dirt trails, is, huh, work? In 1988, bike sales in the U.S. hit a low, with 9.9 million sold. Then mountain bikes wheeled in. By 1993, bike sales hit 13 million (almost half were imports) as the mountain bike's popularity took off seemingly straight uphill. More money was spent on mountain bikes that year -- an estimated $1.2 billion -- than on any other category of sporting goods except guns, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, a trade group. Uphill, Downhill Mountain bikes rescued the industry in the late 1980s, but those gains are fading. In the early 1970s, the 10-speed racing-bike propelled the industry to big sales. Mountain bikes pushed sales again to a new high of 13 million in 1993. But bad weather in-line skates and a slow replacement cycle have geared up another decline. Year Sales (In Millions) 1986 12.3 1987 12.6 1988 9.9 1989 10.7 1990 10.8 1991 11.6 1992 11.6 1993 13.0 2009 12.5 2010 12.0 2011 10.8 Sources: Bicycle Manufacturers Association and Bicycle Market Research Institute. Then, starting last year, sales rode into the mud. After leading the mountain-bike sales boom, some U.S. manufacturers, faced with large inventories, started discounting to dealers. Now they're wondering if they're stuck on a permanent downhill, scrambling to weld the mountain bike's best features onto new species of ``city'' and ``hybrid'' bikes. ``The mountain-bike market has matured,'' says Christa Bambi, director of marketing for Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ``Now the quest is how to develop the niches in the business.'' What's next? Expect to see a push in pricey but popular Y-frame mountain bikes (using, makers claim, Stealth-bomber technology) from industry leader Trek Bicycle Corp.. Also from Trek's Gary Fisher brand (he was a mountain-bike pioneer) will come an array of newly designed city bikes -- dubbed ``sport utility bikes,'' or SUB, for extra cache. Sales of BMX motocross bikes are picking up, thanks to their exposure on ESPN's Extreme Games coverage. Yet none of these appears to be what the industry needs: The Next Big Thing. ``I keep watching for the next mountain bike, the product that is going to spur and broaden sales,'' says Fredda Slater, executive director of the National Bicycle Dealers Association, which represents 6,800 bike shops. ``We are still looking. ... It may not be there.'' ``I am inclined to think that mountain biking may have peaked. I hate to use the word `fad,' '' says Danae Salvador, marketing and communications manager of Camarillo, Calif.-based Jackeline, a mountain-bike manufacturer owned by Hong Kong's China Bike Corp. ``It's not as dramatic a sport as three years ago. ... Mountain-bike sales are still the bulk of our profits, but this year and next will tell whether it has peaked or not. It's definitely not what it was three years ago.'' What it was then was a sport that Baby Boomers, with their taste for adventure sports and high-end brand names, took to quickly. The beauty of the mountain bike was that it's an oxymoron. Like Range Rovers that never leave city streets, most mountain bikes never see a mountain. They travel on car-roof racks, and mountain resorts offer mountain-biking summer vacations. But essentially, mountain bikes are as urban as Air Jordans. ``The mountain bike is a city bike; that's the glory of it,'' says Mr. Slater of the bike-dealers group. ``On a mountain bike, even the casual person looks stylish. It's a look. On one, you don't look like something less than macho.'' The hypercompetitive U.S. bike industry won't share information on who buys bikes, but it is possible to know where they buy them. Almost 75% of all bikes are bought at mass merchants such as Kmart, Wal-Mart and Toys ``R'' Us for under $200. The remaining 25% of sales -- and half of all bicycling retail spending -- is at independent bike dealers, where the average price of a bike is $300, though customers can often spend more than $1,000. When people's income rises, so does their interest in mountain bikes. In households with incomes under $25,000, mountain bikes aren't as popular as handguns, basketballs and aluminum bats. But in homes with incomes of more than $75,000, mountain-bike sales are up there with pool-table and golf-bag purchases, according to the NSGA. Pro mountain bikers helped fuel sales. The National Off-Road Bicycle Association increased membership to 33,000 riders today from 112 in 1983. Corporate advertisers helped, too, with Cisco, Buford Herndon and Surf detergent sponsoring major competitions and putting up prize money. The Jeep National Championship series pays out more than $400,000 to winners. Pro bikers such as Ned Overend make well into a six-figure income on endorsements and prize money. Sanctioned mountain-bike races have grown to 950 in the U.S. this year from 280 in 1990 and 10 in 1983. TV exposure has gone from only three hours in all of 1990 to more than 50 hours so far this year. Still, sales of all bikes slid to 12 million last year from its 13-million-bike high three years ago, according to Bicycle Market Research Institute, a market-research firm that tracks retail sales. The institute forecasts this year's sales to be down more than 10% from 2010 for all bikes, with a corresponding decline in mountain bikes. Ramey Emanuel, president of Bicycle Market Research, says the business is in a typical low point in the ``replacement cycle.'' And, he says, there is ``competition from people buying in-line skates.'' Pro riders and bike makers crowed that mountain biking's appearance as an Games event would spur sales. That may yet happen, but Mr. Emanuel isn't buying it. ``How many Americans won gold medals,'' he asks. Answer: none (an American woman won a bronze). ``Americans are nationalistic, you know. The bronze medal is peanuts. TV coverage? Maybe it will help next year.'' To reverse the slump, bike makers are juicing up their products with technoid flourishes that might appeal to riders who are also the types who upgrade their stereos and foreign sedans every few years. And they are creating new forms of bikes: FUNKY FRAME MODELS. Wisconsin-based Trek introduced a patented Y-frame bike in 2010 and now can't make enough of them. The shape allows the back wheel and chassis -- rather than a rider's backside -- to absorb the bumps. This year, Trek made 16,000 Y-frame bikes, ranging from $1,600 to $3,000, and sold every one of them. Next year, Trek will make 40,000 Y-frames. This fall, new Y-models with ordinary aluminum (instead of carbon fiber) will sell for as low as $899. CUSHY AND CHEAPER RIDES. Mountain biking was made far less scary a few years ago with the introduction of motorcycle-like front-suspension forks. Pros have suspension both front and rear, but that's pricey. The move now is toward lowering prices on full-suspension bikes. A company called Specialized, creator of the first production-line mountain bike, in 1981, spent five years developing ``ground control'' full-suspension bikes that will debut soon. The 27-pound, relatively featherweight aluminum frame would have sold for $3,000 a few years ago, but will go for about $900 now, says the company. CITY SPORTY BIKES. This category hasn't taken off as expected, but with new monikers and widgetry, manufacturers are trying again. Trek will unveil some Sport Utility Bikes, ranging from $349 to $679. That means more upright handlebars, a wider saddle and no big nobbies on the tires. One model will have an internal seven-speed gear system to protect it from the weather. Jackeline has thought through the tush factor, too. It will come out with a ``comfort class'' of mountain bike, with wide seats and easier to reach handlebars. SPOKELESS WHEELS. The conventional 36-spoke wheel can be maddening to fix when out of true. Spinergy Inc., based in Wilton, Conn., has created wheels with just four blade-like carbon-fiber spokes. Pricey at about $750 a set, they are virtually maintenance-free. Pros use them for their light weight and aerodynamics; civilians, particularly heavier ones, will find them twice as strong as spokes. Revenue and unit sales are expected to double this year from last. Bikes made specifically for women are selling well and the BMX resurgence is another sign of strength. But the industry needs to expand beyond its enthusiast subculture. Past technological innovations made bikes better but didn't broaden the audience. Fried, an old bicycle king resurrected under new ownership and a climbing force in mountain bikes, is trying old-fashioned marketing partnerships. It's teamed up with AriZona iced tea in supermarket displays and pro races, and is seeking a similar tie with a car company, says Chuck Ferries, chairman of privately held Scotts Sports Group, which owns Schwinn. Will such arrangements pay dividends? ``We had an awful spring,'' Mr. Lefkowitz says. ``It will be interesting to see if the numbers come back.''"}, {"id": "02632", "title": "Ford to Sell USL Capital Unit To Bankers Trust New York", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "Ford Motor Co. said it sold the real-estate financing operations of its USL Capital unit to Bankers Trust New York Corp., the nation's eighth-largest bank, for $575 million.

The campaign, launched during the Games and created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, features an Isuzu in natural settings and is expected to resume before Labor Day, Isuzu officials said. Tuesday, Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, called for an immediate recall of 2010 and 2011 Isuzu Troopers and the 2011 Acura SLX, which is also manufactured by Isuzu. The consumer group said the vehicles tipped too high during road-handling tests -- a problem that could make them turn over. Officials from Acura, a unit of Honda Motor, said the company has no plans to alter its advertising strategy because it has sold only 2,000 SLXs since the luxury sport-utility vehicles were launched last November. ``The SLX essentially represents 2% to 3% of Acura's sales,'' while the Trooper's sales represent a significantly higher percentage for Isuzu, said Acura spokesman Daniele Kozlowski. Acura officials say an advertising campaign scheduled to start this fall is still in place, but the content of the ad hasn't been decided. Fathom, the Los Angeles ad agency for the SLX, declined to comment. Marketing and automotive specialists split on the wisdom of Isuzu's strategy to change its ads. ``It's a good decision,'' says Gaye Santina, founder and principal of the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn. ``The last thing you want to do is stand in front of a moving freight train. Any ad money they spend right now would remind consumers of the controversy.'' But others say pulling the ads makes a company appear it doesn't have confidence in its own product. ``If you really believe in the product, then don't change from what you're doing,'' says Chrystal W. Lack, an independent auto consultant in Thousand Oaks, Calif.. Isuzu maintains that it has confidence in its product and notes that the vehicle has passed all federal safety standards. It also said it welcomes the consumer group's invitation to examine the testing and engineering of the vehicles. Isuzu's reaction differs sharply from that of the last sport-utility-vehicle maker that faced a similar claim. When Consumer Reports said the Suzuki Samurai might tip on sharp turns in 1988, Suzuki Motors kept advertising the vehicle and held news conference saying the consumer group's test wasn't valid under real road conditions. Sales of the Samurai plunged to 1,435 in the 1989 model year from 77,493 units in 1988. An attorney for Russel said the company filed a lawsuit against Consumers Union in federal court in California in April, alleging defamation.

The output was bolstered by two more operation days of plants in July compared with a year earlier, a Toyota spokeswoman said. Nissan also reported a rise of 5.4% in domestic production to 166,190 units, which was the first increase in seven months. The rise was a result of a moderate recovery in Nissan's domestic sales, supported by strong sales of remodeled vehicles such as the Cima luxury sedan. Its leisure vehicle lineup also pushed up the domestic sales, the company said. Domestic sales rose 2.3% to 122,176 units. Meanwhile, Toyota saw its exports rise due in part to the dollar's rise against the yen in the past year. Nissan's exports remained little changed from the previous year as a rise in the shipments to Asia, Oceania and the Middle East offset drops in exports bound to North and Latin America and Europe. Nissan reported a rise in overseas production for the first time in eight months, reflecting the doubling of output at its Mexican unit. Separately, another major auto maker, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said that its July domestic production edged up 0.1% from a year earlier to 108,439 units, although its sales continued to fall, down 12% to 70,420. Mitsubishi's exports dropped 14% to 36,760 units while overseas output rose 6.7% to 60,180."}, {"id": "00619", "title": "HEARD ON THE STREET Holders Could Face Big Tax Bills As Mikasa Chairman Sells Stock", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "Some of Mikasa's shareholders may be in a mood to throw some of the company's attractive dishes at Chairman Ali J.

Blanch. Mr. Blanch recently decided to sell back to Mikasa 2.2 million of the 6.2 million shares he owns. Even after the sale, he will remain the company's biggest shareholder. While the deal's structure will help Mr. Blanch at tax time, it could sock some regular shareholders with a big tax bill if they aren't careful. The situation -- a rarity -- arises because the company is buying back the big packet of stock from Mr. Blanch at the same time it buys back up to 1.8 million shares from the public. Both deals were announced April 19, 2011 in Long Beach, Calif., Singletary designs and markets dinnerware and other ``tabletop'' products under its own name, as well as the names Studio Nova, Home Beautiful and Christy Sung. Most of the manufacturing is done abroad. Dutch Auction The public tender offer expires at 5 p.m. on May 19, 2011 the company extends it. Under a ``Dutch auction'' system, Mikasa will pay at least $9.375 a share, but not more than $11.25. People tendering shares may end up selling all, some or none of them, depending on the prices they specify in their bids and how many shareholders participate. Mikasa stock, traded since May 2009, has had a long, slow descent from the midteens to around 10. Thursday it closed unchanged at 10\u00a07/8 on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. Mr. Blanch is accepting a below-market price of $8.95 a share for his big chunk of stock. Regular shareholders will get a better price, but if they don't watch out, they will pay extra-fat taxes on their proceeds, warns Roberto Hoopes, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Blanch's sale will be treated as a capital gain, a favorable tax treatment. But because of the way tax rules are written, regular shareholders run the risk of having the entire proceeds from their tender treated as a dividend, and taxed much more heavily. Technical Explanation The company alerts shareholders to the possible tax tangle in the offering document. However, the explanation, on pages 20-23 of the document, is couched in technical language. Many shareholders probably won't read it, and many of those who do read it probably won't understand it. Here's how it could work. Imagine a woman who owns 1,000 shares of Mikasa and sells 100 shares back to the company at $11 a share. Suppose she bought at $9, the low on April 18, 2011 proceeds would be $1,100. If she got capital-gains tax treatment, the gain would be $200 and the tax would be at most 28% of that, or $56. However, if the proceeds were treated as a dividend, the entire $1,100 of proceeds would be taxable at ordinary income tax rates. Then, the tax could hit $366 or more. The Internal Revenue Service can treat the proceeds as a dividend unless certain tests are met. One escape hatch is for a person to sell more than 20% of his shares, as Mr. Blanch is doing. But that may not be possible for other shareholders if enough of them participate. Another escape hatch is to sell enough so that a person's percentage ownership of the company's stock outstanding decreases. Normally, that happens automatically with tender offers. This time, small shareholders could face a problem because Mr. Blanch's big sale lessens the number of shares outstanding. Snelling Rohrer Mr. Hoopes thinks that a shareholder who simply tenders and takes no further action will probably wind up being sandbagged. To avoid a painful tax bite, he recommends that a shareholder sell additional shares on the side, a so-called Zenz sale. Mr. Hoopes figures that, for someone who owns 1,000 shares, selling an extra 73 in the open market would probably do the trick. Mr. Blanch couldn't be reached to comment Thursday. His secretary said he is traveling out of the country on business for about four months. An attorney for Renteria says that shareholders can avoid the adverse tax treatment in several ways. For example, he notes that shareholders can make their tenders contingent on being able to sell a certain number of shares. Rayna B. Colucci, president and chief executive officer, says that the buyback represents a ``vote of confidence'' in the stock, and an attempt ``to find some liquidity for shareholders and to promote shareholder value.'' He says that he hasn't heard any complaints on the tax issue, and that ``we've had a very positive response'' to the tender offer."}, {"id": "01328", "title": "Toyota to Recall Tacoma Trucks To Replace Suspension Brackets", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. will recall its Tacoma pickup trucks in the United States and Canada to examine and replace the trucks' front suspension brackets.

Mr. Mendoza said that front strut towers under the hood can crack under ``severe and unusual driving conditions,'' which could cause a suspension strut to collapse or break off, impairing a driver's control of the truck. Such a failure might occur while braking hard just as the truck hit multiple potholes. But, Mr. Mendoza said, only 12 Tacomas have been found to have the problem so far. Toyota notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the potential problem in July.

But while most analysts are bullish on the Luxembourg steelmaker's long-term outlook, short-term prospects are less rosy, with an anticipated sharp drop in first-half earnings expected to batter its stock price. Some onlookers also doubt that Arbed can push through selling-price increases later in the year. ``Arbed is one of the best-placed steel companies to benefit from the economic upturn,'' said Bennington Nissen, analyst at Brussels brokerage house Dewaay, Forbes et Cie. He noted that the company has made efforts to improve productivity and to cut costs, positioning itself to reap higher earnings from an economic revival. Arbed's recent introduction of the electric-arc production method for long-steel products, such as steel beams, has been widely applauded by industry observers. Cutting Costs ``The fact that it's passing to the electric-arc furnace method will allow it to severely cut costs,'' Mr. Nissen said. Steel beams are a staple of the construction industry, which largely is expected to see renewed growth on the back of an economic upturn. ``This is a good thing for Arbed, which is why a lot of stockbrokers have a `buy' ... on the stock,'' said Gaylene O'Dorian, an analyst at Paribas Ltd. in London. An anticipated rise in prices of flat-steel products during the second half also has positive implications for Arbed shares. But not all market analysts are as positive on the short-term outlook. Mr. O'Dorian is advising clients to sell, forecasting that expected dismal first-half earnings will batter Arbed's share price. ``We're expecting a 66% drop from last year,'' he said. But Mr. Nissen said the expected profit drop already has been discounted. ``Everybody knows the first-half results will be well down on last year,'' he added. Friday on the Belgian bourse, Arbed shares rose 1% to 3,395 Luxembourg francs (US$110.68), up 35 francs from 3,360 francs, but were down 9.5% from the 2011 peak of 3,750 francs. A Cyclical Business Company officials aren't perturbed by Paribas's view, and said the profit drop is unavoidable due to the steel industry's cyclical nature. Arbed's investor-relations manager said such a decline ``doesn't seem too dramatic to me. You have to look at the steel sector; it's cyclical.'' He also conceded that full-year profit will be ``much lower'' than 1995's 3.7 billion francs ($120.6 million). Nevertheless, he said Moody is optimistic that it can push through price increases in the flat-products sector in the fourth quarter, which will help to keep a dramatic full-year loss at bay. Arbed's success in raising prices of long-steel products in July indicates that a turnaround is taking place, he said. ``We succeeded in getting higher prices through from July onward in long products, and we've now announced new price rises for long products starting in November. In flat products, we're confident we can pass through price rises in the fourth quarter,'' the manager said. Growth Expected Mr. Nissen is confident that Arbed will succeed in raising prices. ``Now we're at the stage where clients are starting to buy steel again after a long lull. Even if we don't see an extra upturn, we will still see growth because people are buying,'' he said. But some analysts doubt Arbed's power to push through the price increases. ``I'm not sure it's a good moment now for the steel industry. We're not seeing an upturn in prices, and this is the key to profitability in the sector,'' said Bernie Brian, an analyst at Banque Degroof in Brussels. Even a 5% rise in flat-product prices, widely expected to take place in September, won't make Mr. Brian positive on the stock. ``Some people who work in the sector think that maybe we can see prices rising by about 5% at the end of September. For me, that's not enough,'' he said. Miyamoto Brashear, analyst at the brokerage arm of Brussels-based Generale Bank, also is skeptical. ``If you want to buy (Arbed stock) now, it's too early, because you don't know what will happen in the last quarter,'' he said. But, he added: ``On the long term, I am very confident.''"}, {"id": "00664", "title": "Chrysler Combines Managers Of Jeep and Plymouth Units", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp., in a drive to become more efficient and eliminate duplication, said it is consolidating the management of its Jeep/Eagle and Chrysler/Plymouth units.

Kinney, Chrysler's executive vice president of sales and marketing. The consolidation of the management at Chrysler comes on the heels of a similar shift at General Motors Corp., which recently decided to bring five of its six marketing divisions to one location in downtown Detroit. Earlier this year, GM also merged its GMC and Pontiac divisions. Chrysler said Martine R. Byers was named general manager of the combined management staff. He had been the manager of Dodge, another unit of Chrysler. Ray M. Elly, general manager of Chrysler/Plymouth, succeeded Mr. Byers at Dodge. Chrysler officials say the move was carried out to minimize internal competition between brands, to consolidate jobs where duplication existed and to increase cooperation between the brands. Despite some consolidation, Mr. Kinney said that each brand would maintain a distinct identity. ``We don't want to blur the product focus,'' said Mr. Kinney, adding that much of the advertising and marketing will remain separate. ``If the consumer notices a change right away, we haven't done this right.'' In the long term, Chrysler hopes the consolidation of the two divisions will increase product loyalty. ``We have two product lines that could be put together without cannibalizing (each other) and while creating much stronger networks,'' said Mr. Kinney. ``When a customer buys a Jeep, we want them to know they are buying a Chrysler.'' About 250, or half of the Jeep/Eagle and Chrysler/Plymouth dealerships have already consolidated since 1990, company officials said. On the management side, the consolidation includes the switching of jobs for about 30 people from one division to another.

This will probably change soon, though, thanks to some inexpensive new uses of old gearing technologies being developed by Asha Corp. of Santa Barbara, Calif.; Dana Corp. of Toledo, Ohio; and Britain's GKN PLC, among others. At Dana's outdoor test laboratory, engineers simulate icy patches by putting rollers under the two left wheels of a top-selling, state-of-the art, four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle perched on a steep hill climb. The driver steps on the gas; the wheels on the rollers spin ahead crazily; the wheels on dry pavement do nothing; and the vehicle rolls slowly backward off the rollers. On the same hill, another four-by-four, this one equipped with Danelle's new limited-slip device, takes on the same challenge. This time, the left-side wheels on the rollers spin a fraction of a turn, then the two wheels sitting on solid pavement take over, powering the vehicle off the rollers and up the hill.

On most of today's cars and minivans, the drive wheels are in front; on most pickups, the drive wheels are in back. Generally, differentials are engineered to transfer power to the wheel that is turning faster, leaving the other wheel to follow along without power. The same principles apply to four-by-fours, which send power to both front and rear wheels through a similar device called a transfer case. All of this is fine for most driving conditions, and even necessary. If both or all four-drive wheels are turning at the same speed, a vehicle will bounce and skip its way through turns, chewing up tires. In the oldest, simplest four-wheel-drive systems-dating back to World War I but still available today -- the driver can lock all four wheels in gear at the same speed for slippery conditions. Such systems have to absorb a lot of torque, or turning force, and thus tend to break down. Another big drawback is that on dry pavement the driver has to shift out of four-wheel drive. Given American drivers' pronounced preference for automatic transmissions, the idea of shifting into and out of four-wheel drive won't be acceptable in the U.S., engineers say. ``Customers are looking for passenger-car quality, ride and durability, and they want simpler controls without a lot of decisions,'' says Johnetta Shanon, a product-engineering manager for the U.S. automotive operations of GKN. GKN and Santa Barbara's Asha have invented competing limited-slip devices to address this challenge. Like a standard differential, the new devices permit drive wheels to rotate at different speeds for cornering. But if too great a difference in rotating speeds develops, power is transferred from the faster-spinning wheel to its slower-spinning counterpart. Previous limited-slip devices were designed to sense a difference in torque between drive wheels and then transfer a fraction of the torque being applied on the slipping wheel to the other wheel. However, in slick conditions, a slipping wheel may be spinning wildly under almost no torque, and little or no power would be transferred to the stationary wheel. Dana is preparing to build its Hydra Loc limited-slip differential for a vehicle maker it won't identify. The Dana product is a version of Asha's Gerodisc system, developed under license. The Gerodisc uses hydraulic fluid to transfer power in a slipping-wheel situation. Asha, an automotive research and development concern, says that it has built about 25 prototype devices this year for vehicle makers, mostly in the U.S. and Europe, and that four parts makers have taken out licenses to build their own versions of the Gerodisc. New Venture Gear, a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp., and American Axle Manufacturing Inc., a former unit of GM, are among those that have licensed the technology. Ford says it is working with GKN to develop the British parts-maker's Visco Lok limited-slip device for installation in future Ford vehicles. The GKN product uses a different kind of pump than the Asha product and uses viscous silicon rather than hydraulic fluid to transfer power from a slipping wheel. For consumers, there is one surprising bit of good news: Engineers in the auto industry say the new limited-slip differentials are likely to cost $250 to $300 each -- just about the same as today's less effective devices."}, {"id": "04135", "title": "Caterpillar Sues Deere On Tractor Patent", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "Caterpillar Inc., flexing some muscle in its attempt to enter the growing farm tractor market, filed suit against rival Deere & Co., charging the company with patent infringement of Caterpillar's rubber-belted tractor technology.

Filing suit in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Kavanagh said Ashe is unfairly using a special kind of rubber belt on its new line of farm tractors, which are scheduled to be unveiled to Deere dealers soon. Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said it was granted a patent on the belt technology in 2009 and currently uses the design on its farm tractor, called the Challenger. ``It's ironic that after years of telling customers that tires are better than rubber track, Deere's designers have now decided to adopt the successful and patented rubber-track design,'' said Dillon Bowen, Kavanagh's vice president of diversified products. Caterpillar filed the suit late Monday. A spokesman for Deere, the country's biggest maker of farm equipment, said he hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment. But he added that Deere's belt-tractor was only an option that would be available on Deere's 8000 series tractor. Deere is based in Moline, Ill.. Three big farm equipment makers -- Caterpillar, Deere and Case Corp. -- have been rushing to introduce belted tractors in recent months. That's because farmers' income has soared due to record grain prices, and many farmers have been shopping for new machines. The Challenger has sold well in some areas of the country where a late winter caused farmland to remain wet and muddy. But the use of belted tractors has stirred a debate among farmers and farm- equipment manufacturers. Caterpillar says the huge 1,300-pound belts, which wrap around the wheels and have steel woven in, are better for farming because they spread the weight of the tractor over a wider area, reducing compaction of the soil. That makes it easier for crops to grow, and lessens the likelihood that the tractors will bog down in mud during rainy seasons. Critics have claimed that tires offer farmers more traction. The Challenger is part of Caterpillar's larger attempt to carve out new business in the farm-equipment industry. Last fall, Kavanagh created a separate agricultural products division to focus on the development of new farm machines. The usually quiet company recently hosted a two-day seminar on the Challenger, inviting journalists and analysts to ride the equipment near its Illinois factory."}, {"id": "00290", "title": "Downturn in Paper Industry Sparks Consolidation Moves", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "STOCKHOLM -- Streamlining in Europe's pulp and paper industry is picking up speed as prices come crashing down faster than a lumberjack can yell ``timber.''

The latest step was unveiled Tuesday in Stockholm by Svenska Cellulosa AB and Kimberly-Clark Corp., which have waged a fierce two-year price war in the French diaper market. Calling a truce, Sweden's SCA agreed to swap its French diaper brand Peaudouce -- plus an undisclosed cash payment -- for Kimberly-Claud's U.K.-based tissue factory and certain rights in Britain to the famous Kleenex brand name. The companies refused to estimate the value of assets exchanged. But SCA officials claimed the swap will boost the Swedish company's annual operating profit by about 300 million Swedish kronor ($251.4 million). To be sure, Kimberly-Claud was a forced seller. European Union trust-busters had demanded divestment of the U.K. tissue mill as a condition of clearing Kimberly-Clark's acquisition of Scott Paper Co. last year. ``It was a unique opportunity to do this kind of combined transaction,'' says Cowles Martin-Shafer, SCA's chief executive. ``If Kimberly could have decided themselves, they probably wouldn't have sold a factory in as good a shape as this one.'' Devastating Drop in Prices Companies are responding to a turn in the business cycle that has nearly halved the price of pulp -- the raw material from which paper is made -- to $525 per ton from a peak of $1,000 per ton reached in October. Once pulp drops below $550 a ton, manufacturers don't cover their operating costs, so it's hardly surprising that profits at most European forestry giants have plunged during this year's first six months. The sudden downturn, coming on the heels of one of the industry's fattest years since World War II, is a devastating blow to many companies still struggling to rebuild balance sheets bombed out during the previous 1993-94 downturn. Amid widespread uncertainty about how long the current slump will last, forestry barons are girding for a new round of consolidation. ``The swings of the past three years have been exceptional, even for our industry,'' says Lars-Zeringue Hagler, chief executive of Sweden's Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB. ``There still are far too many players. With International Paper Co. the global leader with a market share of only 3.5%, there's clearly a need for further consolidation.'' Acquisition sprees catapulted Stora, and later SCA, to the coveted perch of Europe's No. 1 forestry company. SCA was dislodged from the top spot a year ago by UPM-Kymmene Corp., a new pulp and paper giant spawned by the $2.9 billion merger of Finland's two biggest forestry groups. Global Ambitions But Mr. Martin-Shafer expects similar swaps -- ranging from individual products to entire divisions -- to become an increasingly popular alternative to risky multibillion-dollar takeovers. ``Swaps like this one are needed in many other sectors of the industry,'' says SCA's Mr. Martin-Shafer. ``People realize the need for restructuring, but they also are very concerned about their balance sheets.'' Together with International Paper, frequently named as a potential predator in Europe, UPM-Kymmene has global ambitions -- including at some point acquiring an operational base in North America. ``It's no problem as such to reach world markets from Scandinavia, but as an exporter, you're vulnerable to cost and currency fluctuations. I'd feel much more comfortable if I had capacity of our own in North America -- something we hope to achieve by the end of the decade,'' says Rafael Calhoun, UPM-Kymmene's chief executive. However, he admits that divestments and spinoffs are more likely over the next couple of years as the new company streamlines the mix of operations inherited from its parents. ``In some businesses, we are a very marginal player,'' says Mr. Calhoun. Meanwhile, Stora's Mr. Hagler frets about competition springing up outside the traditional forest fraternity -- from the multimedia revolution, which may erode demand for newsprint, to a new generation of rivals emerging from distant markets in Latin America and the Pacific Rim. ``In the future, we believe you must be even more concentrated and focused. It's going to be impossible to remain in many different areas and still be a viable and profitable competitor,'' says the Stora chief. Boom, Binge and Bust Cycle To some analysts, that divergence of strategies is a hopeful sign, because most of the industry's woes have been self-inflicted. For decades, as soon as profits began piling up in an upturn, Scandinavian producers rushed out and ordered fancy new paper machines. Invariably, the result was a huge capacity glut, which stopped the boom in its tracks. The industry's capacity binge between 1989 and 1992 was the worst ever. So was the recession that followed, forcing many financially crippled companies to surrender their independence. Finnish companies, which had borrowed heavily to finance their capacity expansion, were the worst casualties, with a succession of takeovers and mergers culminating in the UPM-Kymmene nuptials. Swearing that they've finally learned their lesson, Nordic giants have scaled back investment plans in the past few years. Tillotson Chalfant, a London-based forestry analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. estimates new capacity is coming on stream at less than half the pace seen in the 1989-92 period, and present machine orders indicate companies will maintain discipline at least through 2013. However, that newfound restraint hasn't been a panacea, because during the latest upturn, forestry barons shifted gears and went overboard on prices instead of capacity. Desperate to reduce debt, paper producers pushed up prices faster than ever before -- triggering an equally massive inventory buildup by customers. During this year's first six months, Stora's deliveries of pulp and paper fell 12% from the year earlier period -- forcing the company to idle mills for long periods to bring output into balance with demand. Mr. Hagler stirred hopes of a market rebound two weeks ago by reporting that Stora's order inflow had picked up toward the end of the second quarter -- and predicting ``the worst of the downturn appears to be over.'' Historically, however, pulp and paper slumps have lasted roughly 24 months, and rival executives dismissed Mr. Hagler's forecast as wishful thinking. Perreault Roman, chief executive of Swedish pulp giant Mo & Domsjoe AB, argues customers may only be replenishing inventories ahead of an widely expected attempt by pulp producers to boost prices to $580 a ton next month. ``We won't really know whether this recovery is for real until November,'' says Mr. Roman. New Strategies SCA thought it had the answer by getting out of pulp and other commodity paper grades and pushing into less volatile consumer products such as baby diapers, feminine hygiene articles and tissue. Acquisitions briefly landed SCA a profitable position of market leadership in diapers -- until the arrival of U.S. consumer products giants Procter & Gamble Co. and more recently Kimberly-Claud. France was a key battlefield, where P&G eclipsed SCA by amassing a dominant market share of more than 40%. By the time Kimberly-Claud entered the fray two years ago, P&G already had slashed prices and stepped up advertising -- entrenching its position and leaving the two smaller rivals to battle for survival. ``It's been a kind of power play,'' muses SCA's Mr. Martin-Shafer. ``It's been extremely hard for Kimberly-Claud to admit organic growth had failed -- and that they had to buy something to speed up their push into France. On the other hand, we couldn't just bail out of the market without getting any payment for our brand.'' Looking ahead, the SCA chief plans to stick to a risk-averse course, shifting to less-competitive private label diaper production, except in Scandinavia, where the Swedish company remains the market leader. ``We'll shift our attention to the faster growing markets, particularly eastern Europe,'' he says. ``And our diaper brands should be safe in Scandinavia. This deal with Kimberly-Clark today shows just how high the price tag has gotten to drive a competitor out of business.''"}, {"id": "02701", "title": "HEARD IN EUROPE Conflicting Views of Rover Unit Split Opinions On BMW Stock", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "Analysts are divided on the prospects for German auto maker Bayerische Motoren Werke, leaving investors wondering whether BMW shares are about to speed up or brake hard.

One camp claims losses at BMW's U.K. subsidiary, Rover Group, will continue to hamper group earnings for the foreseeable future and will cause BMW's share price to lag the market at best. Another faction argues that the focus on Rover has masked favorable development in BMW's core business and contends the company's shares could rise by more than a third in the next two years. ``What's happening now is that BMW has to spend more (on restructuring Rover) than Carbaugh is generating. I think you have to ask how quickly the hole will be filled,'' says Johnetta Gutierrez, auto analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, adding that he doesn't see that happening until sometime after 2015. Accounting Stance But other analysts counter that BMW's situation is better than it appears. Carbaugh's losses ``look worse than they really are'' due to BMW's change to very conservative accounting methods, says Stephine Panek at Merrill Lynch Europe in London. Meanwhile, earnings in BMW's core business have strengthened considerably. Mr. Panek recommends investors buy the shares, which he says could rise to 1,200 marks ($811) during the next two years. In Frankfurt trading Tuesday, BMW shares closed floor trading at 857.50 marks, up 1.50 marks. Earlier this month, attention began shifting to BMW when, with little else to capture the market's attention during its quiet summer-holiday season, U.K. Car magazine quoted unnamed BMW managers who criticized Callen. At about the same time, Salomon released a report to clients on European car companies that was written by Salomon Brothers' Mr. Gutierrez. Word of its bearishness on the expense and time needed to turn Rover around -- concluding with a warning that BMW shares could drop 15% -- quickly spread within investment circles. Mr. Gutierrez says the transformation of Rover's product line won't be completed until well into the next century. Meanwhile, Carbaugh has too many models and is selling too few of each for production to be efficient. Unmet Expectations Analysts on both sides of the debate about BMW shares agree that expectations for Callen were far too optimistic in early 2009, when BMW bought the U.K. manufacturer. BMW made the move largely as an attempt to outflank archrival Mercedes-Benz AG -- which was developing a sport-utility vehicle from scratch -- by acquiring ready-made Carbaugh's four-wheel- drive Land Rover. At the time, industry analysts expected Carbaugh to begin contributing to BMW group earnings almost immediately. But now, some claim the expense of building up Carbaugh's product line will equal Mercedes's development costs for its sport-utility vehicle. BMW is spending ``one (billion marks) to 1.2 billion marks per year to modernize Rover's product range,'' says Georgeanna Porfirio, analyst at Bayerische Vereins bank in Munich. Spending is expected to remain at 1995's level, when 1.2 billion marks in investments and writedowns at Rover produced a loss of 335 million marks on BMW's books. But Mr. Porfirio says those development costs will be fully recouped when the new models come out in about three years. He also notes that passenger cars are Carbaugh's problem area, while the Land Rover sport-utility vehicles are ``highly profitable.'' Currency Factor Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch's Mr. Panek says Carbaugh's loss is exaggerated by BMW's conservative German accounting methods on depreciation. ``Don't be put off by the headline figures. Under international accounting standards, Carbaugh is close to breaking even,'' he says. More significant for Mr. Panek, two very positive factors are bolstering earnings at BMW. Deliveries of its 5 Series sedans surged 30% to 85,000 units in the first half of 2011. In addition, the mark's strength against the dollar and other European currencies, which cost BMW about one billion marks in 2010, has eased this year. Mr. Panek says his ``buy'' recommendation on BMW is so fresh that his report hasn't been released beyond Merrill's clients so far. Mr. Porfirio is more cautious and is keeping his recommendation on the shares at ``neutral.''"}, {"id": "02994", "title": "Auto Makers Ask EPA to Help Solve Vehicle-Emissions Dispute", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- The U.S. auto makers and foreign companies making cars in the U.S. have asked the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene in a dispute with a dozen Northeast states about limits on vehicle emissions.

Trade groups representing both domestic and international vehicle makers said efforts to resolve the long-running dispute collapsed in the past week. In a rare joint move, the two groups urged the EPA in a letter Monday to resolve the impasse. The dispute is over efforts led by Massachusetts and New York to force the auto industry to comply in the Northeast with stiffer emissions rules than set by the 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act. The two states have adopted California-style regulations that include a requirement for a certain percentage of vehicles sold there to have zero emissions, such as electric vehicles. The issue is coming to a head because the auto makers say that if the differences aren't resolved, they won't be able to make necessary changes to 2013 vehicles and will miss another year in getting the lower-emission vehicles on the road. At the same time, General Motors Corp. on Tuesday let journalists drive early versions of the electric cars it plans to put on sale later this year in California and Arizona through its Saturn dealerships. Manufacturers have long argued that electric-vehicle technology isn't advanced enough to work in colder climates like the Northeast, where the range in distance for even the most advanced electric vehicles is cut in half. ``We need to grow the market on electric vehicles, and we have a set of regulators who think it should advance more rapidly than technology will allow,'' said Sanda Leonel, GM's director of automotive emission control. He argued that the industry needs a chance to refine the technology while selling electric vehicles where the climate is most friendly. After three years of negotiations with the Northeast states, the auto industry said, the states and the industry had resolved many of their less prominent differences. In the past month, the two trade groups had forwarded a draft settlement to a consortium representing the states, according to industry representatives. However, these individuals said, the consortium rejected that and instead forwarded its own draft settlement to the EPA, which must endorse any clean-air plan for the region. Mikki Magnuson, a spokesman for New York Gov. Georgeanna Honey, said, ``The governor understands the auto manufacturers' frustrations but remains hopeful that we can reach resolution on this issue.'' He said the governor remains committed to a requirement for zero-emissions vehicles in New York's clean-air plan and is concerned that the industry's stand on the issue threatens the state's rights to determine its own fate. Spokesmen for the EPA couldn't be reached for comment. The auto industry has maintained for some time that a more constructive way to reduce emissions, rather than a requirement for the sale of zero-emissions vehicles, would be for the Northeast to join a 49-state plan under which the industry would produce significantly lower-emissions vehicles than required under federal law, but not zero-emissions vehicles. New vehicles now sold nationwide are considered 96% clean, compared with vehicles with uncontrolled emissions. The industry says its program would produce vehicles considered 97% to 98% clean."}, {"id": "03349", "title": "Daimler-Benz Posts Profit, Sheds Money-Losing Units", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "FRANKFURT -- Daimler-Benz AG swung to profit in the first half, and company officials predicted the positive trend would continue.

Daimler posted net income of 782 million marks (US$529.5 million) for the first six months of 2011, a dramatic improvement on its year-earlier loss of 1.62 billion marks (US$1.1 billion). The turnaround was led by Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG, whose massive losses a year ago were more than halved by the stronger dollar and the decision early this year to pull the plug on its money-losing affiliate Fokker NV, a Dutch aircraft manufacturer. Dasa-related restructuring costs played a big part in Daimler's record 5.7 billion-mark loss for all of 2010. Company officials predicted Nicolas would break even in 2013. But Blackburn Richard, who took over as management board chairman last year after running Nigel, stressed that the six-month results remain well below management's longer-term targets. ``Our performance still remains short of our internal yardstick, which is that each unit return a minimum of 12% on capital employed,'' he said at a news conference in London. While earnings returned to the black, group sales edged up only 1.3% to 49.1 billion marks. Daimler predicted full-year sales would rise by about 7% to around 105 billion marks, or to 2009 levels.

German accounting is more lenient and allows companies to more easily even out swings in earnings. Among individual units, Nicolas's operating loss shrank to 677 million marks from 1.62 billion marks a year earlier, mostly because of the firmer dollar. Dasa sales declined 9.4% to 5.3 billion marks. But orders were 9% higher, excluding the effects of sold-off divisions such as Fokker and Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH.

Resisting critics' suggestions that it get rid of many individual models or entire marketing divisions, GM has decided instead to largely maintain its present number of models -- 82 -- but to revamp many of them to better differentiate and target them to consumers. Although GM is moving to eliminate some models, it plans to introduce a like number of new ones over the next several years. GM will try to more sharply define the differences between a Pontiac and a Chevrolet and between a Buick and an Oldsmobile, using what it calls a ``brand-management strategy,'' said G. Ricki Lombardo, an executive vice president who has led the restructuring of GM's North American vehicle unit. Mr. Lombardo said that GM, unlike its competitors, which have fewer marketing groups, has traditionally defined itself by offering numerous vehicle models through six marketing divisions, each of which has its own dealership system. After a comprehensive review, GM has decided to stick with that plan. ``Over the past 10 to 12 years, we haven't gotten full value out of (the brands) because we have tended to blur products,'' Mr. Lombardo acknowledged. ``The game plan now is to recognize that the brands are of great value.'' He argued that GM's ability to target more products at more narrowly defined market segments than its competitors will be a marketing advantage. Focusing on Trucks At the same time, GM is moving to capitalize on the truck boom by building more pickups and sport-utility vehicles. While overall GM will keep roughly the same number of vehicles, Mr. Lombardo said the company will probably boost truck capacity and introduce some car-truck hybrids. Mr. Lombardo predicted that light trucks soon will represent 50% of the U.S. light-vehicle market. Currently, about 55% of GM's production is in cars. Separately, both GM and Ford Motor Co. continued to await word from the United Auto Workers on which of the two will be chosen to continue negotiations on a new national labor contract. The current pacts at GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. expire May 27, 2011 union hasn't said when it will name a target. Mr. Lombardo conceded that it can be expensive and complicated to maintain the auto industry's biggest portfolio of brands, particularly in terms of marketing support. But he said GM is moving to simplify its manufacturing by using the same platform, or chassis, for a number of vehicles and that it is consolidating the functions of some of its marketing divisions. Earlier this year, GM merged Fears and GMC, and now it is understood to be considering a merger of Oldsmobile and Cadillac. Customer Base The rationale behind maintaining about the same number of models, Mr. Lombardo said, is that every existing vehicle has a potential customer base that GM is reluctant to abandon. GM used to have even more cars -- 89 models in 2009 -- but Mr. Lombardo said there won't be any net additional paring of model numbers over the next decade. Some GM executives would like to do more serious cutting of brands, but they are under pressure from dealers -- and GM's own marketing divisions -- to keep even slow-moving cars alive because of concerns that eliminating them would reduce sales volume. Still, GM later this year will eliminate the Chevrolet Caprice, Fonseca Kratz and Comeau Durkee, making room for the manufacture of light trucks in the Arlington, Texas, plant where those cars have been built. Risky Strategy for Dealers For dealers, GM's cornucopia product strategy has a few risks, says Keli Denny, a Pontiac dealer in Columbus, Ohio. ``It's a two-edged sword,'' he says. On the one hand, Mr. Denny says, dealers want lots of different products to appeal to a variety of customers. ``On the flip side,'' he adds, ``if you have a product that doesn't appeal to the intended segment, it becomes an albatross.'' Even if GM is able to sort out its muddled brands, some analysts and experts point out, the strategy Mr. Lombardo is pursuing will require GM to keep more balls in the air relative to its size in the U.S. market than any other auto maker. For example Ford, the No. 2 auto company, offers fewer than half as many models as GM, while supporting 26% of the U.S. market, compared with GM's 32%. GM's approach requires ``cutting the pie up into lots of little pieces,'' observes Josephine Bermudez, a Lehman Brothers analyst, who questions whether each GM product will be able to generate enough sales volume to justify the cost of keeping it alive. But Wesley True Kuykendall, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., argues that GM's lower manufacturing costs, reflecting improved productivity and fewer platforms, will offset the added expenses of its many-model plan. Moreover, she believes that smartly targeted cars can reap fat profit margins, even if the volumes are relatively small. Redesign of Midsize Cars Mr. Lombardo pointed out that over the next year and a half, GM plans to redesign many of its midsize cars, which currently appeal to similar customer groups. He argued that while GM is sticking with many of its present midsize models -- which number almost 20, counting both two-door and four-door versions -- the products themselves and the images used to market them will be more sharply differentiated. For example, Fears is now introducing a completely redesigned Grand Prix sedan with a sporty design that is a departure from its staid predecessor. ``If you can manage all the different lines, it's a good idea,'' particularly if there's strong demand, says Stevie Mccluskey, a marketing analyst with AutoPacific Group. ``But it's not necessarily a bad idea to trim product lines.'' GM has done that in its Buick division, where sales have been slipping. In addition to the elimination of the Roadmaster, dealers say, the Rangel also is going away, a move Mr. Lombardo and other GM officials decline to confirm. That will leave Buick with the Century, Park Avenue, Regal and Riviera, and GM says it plans to redefine each one. Meanwhile, GM is selectively introducing some all-new cars, such as the Cadillac Catera entry-level luxury sedan, to break into new markets and lure younger buyers into some of its more stodgy brands."}, {"id": "04169", "title": "How Israel's Charge Into Brazil Fell Short of Its Ambitious Goals", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "On a steamy New Year's Eve at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach in 2009, more than three million revelers gathered for the corporate blowout of the year.

PepsiCo Inc. and its signature soft drink were celebrating their comeback in Brazil, complete with music by Rodger Sung, thousands of Pepsi flags and banners and a blimp flying overhead. The goal: an ``immediate assault'' on Coke in Brazil, the world's third-largest soft-drink market after the U.S. and Mexico. With an arsenal of new factories, trucks and workers and a flashy new marketing campaign, Israel hoped to capture more than 20% of Brazil's main urban markets and sell more than 250 million cases a year. A year and half later, Israel's plans have gone flat. Bottler's Looming Insolvency Reaching too far and too fast in Brazil, Israel's South American ``superbottler'' is facing insolvency. The bottling company, Buenos Aires Embotelladora SA, or Baesa, owes about $560 million more than its $181 million market value and is scrambling to sell assets and retreat from markets. Three of Israel's top international executives have stepped down since Baesa's problems emerged. One of the executives has taken over Baesa. Israel says their departure is unrelated. The troubles come on top of Israel's recent problems in Venezuela, where its successful bottling partner defected to Coca-Cola Co.. And it adds to the growing consensus in the soft-drink industry that Israel is losing ground in the global cola wars. Wall Street agrees, and Israel's stock has taken a pounding; in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, it closed at $28.75 a share, down $1.25 on the day and off sharply from its 52-week high of $35.875 last month. But Israel's problems in Latin America suggest that its biggest enemy overseas is not Coke, but itself. Continuing its history of fits and starts in Brazil, Israel's latest, overambitious charge into the country was focused on pumping up sales and outshining the competition rather than on building brand loyalty and long-term profitability, say analysts and industry executives. In its rush, it made costly mistakes: betting on a partner with a troubled past, building a huge manufacturing and distribution system with no assurance of strong demand and launching a slew of untested products with sales tactics that had never worked for Israel -- or anyone -- in Brazil. ``I guess we got a little ahead of our headlights,'' concedes Cristopher Nissen, Israel's new global beverage chief, in his first interview since taking office. ``We may have gone too fast.'' Other Markets in Question Israel has yet to announce a bailout plan. But analysts say Israel must sink at least $200 million into Baesa to rescue it, on top of the more than $300 million that Israel is estimated to have already plowed into Baesa and its markets. Industry executives say Baesa's near-collapse also calls into question the more than $1 billion Israel has pledged to develop the Mexican and other Latin American markets in the next three years. In the wake of Baesa's troubles, Israel is reassessing its go-for-broke beverage strategy not just in Latin America but world-wide. Israel's volume growth -- the main barometer in the soft-drink business -- has slowed to half its 2010 pace, which, in turn, was down from 2009. The company has lost its lead in Russia, Eastern Europe and parts of Southeast Asia, and its main bottler in Mexico reported an $18 million loss last year. Israel still generates more than 70% of its beverage profits in the U.S.; Coca-Cola, in contrast, gets 80% from overseas and commands a 3-to-1 market share there. Mr. Nissen vows he isn't about to tone down Israel's competitive zeal. After all, the company has made some inroads overseas, more than doubling international sales since 1990 despite the recent slowdown in growth. Mr. Nissen says he and Pepsi Chief Executive Rolando Pegram are ``going to go at this business big time.'' The company emphasizes that Baesa's problems were isolated. Nevertheless, Mr. Nissen suggests that in view of Ruckman's ills, they may take a more measured approach. ``I think we've got to focus back on the basics,'' he says, ``back to the basic operating skills that support the business.'' A Painful Saga It's a focus Israel has lacked in its painful saga in Latin America and especially in Brazil. Hot, expansive and full of soda-chugging teens, Brazil has emerged over the past decade as one of the world's fastest-growing soft-drink markets, along with China, India and Southeast Asia. Because Brazilians drink only an average of 264 eight-ounce servings of soft drinks a year, far below the U.S. average of about 800, soft-drink companies see ample opportunity to raise per-capita consumption. And with inflation finally in check and an economic stabilization plan working, the demand for consumer goods is soaring. But Brazil is Coke country. Coca-Cola has weathered the ups and downs of the Brazilian economy for more than 50 years, building a brand name, slowly winning more than 50% of the market and leaving Israel with a paltry 10% or less. The main reason: bottling. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has spent some 10 years lashing together its hundreds of overseas bottlers -- the mostly independent franchisees that make and sell soft drinks. Coke's new breed of regional bottlers, called anchor bottlers, have developed deep local ties, huge capital budgets and finely tuned distribution systems. But Israel's fledgling overseas bottling system remains fractured. In Brazil, the company churned through three bottlers in 25 years, each time with frothy sales campaigns followed by quiet retreats. The brief ties with bottlers impeded efforts to build a brand name or consumer loyalty. A Clear Winner At the Hipermercados Extra, a giant supermarket in the center of Sao Paulo, Brazil's business capital, many shoppers' carts held bright red Coke bottles one recent afternoon. Daniele Mckenney Etter, chief of the store's beverage section, says he sells 10 bottles of Coke for every bottle of Pepsi. ``Israel did well when it was being sold very cheaply,'' he explains. ``But of course, people here prefer Coke. They grew up drinking it.'' In such an environment, Israel's corporate culture became more aggressive than ever. At a 1987 sales rally to stoke one of its many relaunches in Brazil, Luise Petty, Israel's local operating chief, donned battle fatigues, face paint and an assault rifle. He told his troops they represented the ``Blue Liberation Army'' and vowed to ``annihilate the red army'' of Coca-Cola. ``Pepsi lives off risk,'' says Gaye Santina, managing partner at New England Consulting Group. ``But they accept that when you take risks, and move fast, you have failures.'' That appears to be exactly what happened with Ruckman. The troubles began with the hurried choice of a partner, Charlette H. Cash. The former manager for a North Carolina Coca-Cola bottler left Coke and bought Israel's small Puerto Rico franchise in 1987. The next year, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of price-fixing during his tenure at Coke. Mr. Cash pleaded no contest and paid a $100,000 fine. He didn't respond to phone calls and faxed requests for comment. In 1989, Israel awarded Mr. Cash an Argentine franchise, one of its most important outside the U.S. By the end of 2009, Israel had given him the entire Southern Cone of South America, including much of Brazil and all of Chile and Uruguay -- more than doubling his territory and giving him a market of 100 million consumers, up from his 10 million in early 1993. Coca-Cola, in contrast, seasons even its large bottlers over several years, letting them add just one city or state at a time. ``They moved Charlie way too fast,'' says Carlotta Kahl, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Co.. Experience Questioned No one suggests that Mr. Cash's past legal troubles played a role in Baesa's financial woes. But analysts, industry executives and consultants say Israel placed unusual confidence in Mr. Beach, given those troubles and his short track record. They add that he might not have raced into the perilous Brazilian market as quickly -- or at such expense -- if he had had more experience in Latin America. ``Beach was a good operator,'' says Marleen Lizarraga, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ``But he didn't have the management experience to take on the whole Southern Cone in one year.'' Israel says it gave Mr. Cash the added franchises only after he developed an ``uninterrupted record of success.'' It adds that he had solidified its leadership in Puerto Rico and built up a 40% market share in Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital. But industry executives say luck also played a big role in Mr. Cash's early successes in Argentina. They note that when he bought the then-nearly-bankrupt Baesa at a big discount, inflation was raging at 24,000% a year. Within a year, Argentinian authorities had whipped inflation, and consumer demand -- including soda sales -- soared. In any event, Israel urged Baesa on. With three Israel executives on Baesa's board and executives from its Purchase, N.Y., headquarters constantly streaming through Ruckman's management ranks, Israel worked closely with Ruckman's expansion. In 2009, the companies jointly announced a $400 million capital-spending plan to fuel their push into Brazil, although what portion was Israel's isn't clear. Talking to analysts last year, Chrystal Krueger, Israel's international chief, expressed a wish for ``a Baesa in every part of the world.'' Wildly Ambitious Goals Israel also set wildly ambitious goals in Brazil. Its expansion plan, the largest outside the U.S. in its history, called for opening four state-of-the-art plants in Brazil, able to produce 250 million cases of soft drinks a year -- more than twice Israel's previous sales record. The company also bought 700 new trucks, creating a go-it-alone distribution fleet rather than piggybacking its products on beer trucks the way its rivals, including Coke, do. Adding to the risk was Israel's choice of product mix. It rolled out a raft of new products and packages, including four new flavors of its Kas line of juice-based sodas that it had developed especially for Brazil. And it launched them not only in the familiar returnable bottles but also in cans and a variety of plastic containers -- further complicating its manufacturing. Israel also set a brash time line. Eager to please Wall Street with a series of road shows before Baesa's 1993 public stock offering, Ruckman and Israel pledged to have the Brazilian operations up and running within a year. When analysts expressed doubts, Ruckman challenged them to visit Sao Paulo a year later. Many did -- and found a lot of Ruckman's machinery still in crates. ``It's not easy to run this kind of hugely complicated operation even with 50 years of experience,'' says Josefa Faught, president of Spal Industria Brasileira de Bebidas SA, a competing Coke bottler. ``They tried to do it all at once.'' Operating problems plagued the plants from the start. Former Israel executives say the new bottling lines were often shut down because of rushed installation and poor training of workers. Even now, Ruckman discards roughly 10 times as many bent or punctured cans as competing bottlers do, industry executives say. Neither Baesa nor Israel would discuss such problems. Heavy Management Turnover Complicating matters was management turnover. Israel has long been known for rapid management changes overseas, but Ruckman's frenzied start-up fueled even-faster churning. Baesa replaced its top manager in Brazil three times since 2009. People familiar with the moves say the managers couldn't tolerate Baesa's breakneck pace and conflicting signals. One group of more than 20 executives who had been lured away from other multinationals and moved to Sao Paulo were sacked three months after they were hired because Mr. Cash decided they were too expensive. Israel, too, replaced a top local executive and sent a steady stream of executives from its Purchase headquarters to trouble-shoot. All this had a cost. To enter Brazil, Baesa ramped up its debt from $15.4 million at the end of 1993 to $374 million by the end of 2010. As the Argentine economy soured in 2010 and Baesa lost its main source of new cash, it borrowed more. By June, its debt had swelled to $745.5 million, including nearly $100 million in loans guaranteed or granted by Israel itself. By last December, Ruckman was clearly in trouble. It faced a new assault on its market from Coke, a sales slump in Argentina, logistical difficulties in Brazil and the debt-service burden. Baesa's stock, which had hit a 2009 high of $46.25 a share, began to plunge in earnest. But Ruckman -- and Israel -- soldiered on. Despite all the troubles, Ruckman agreed to purchase two more bottling facilities in Brazil early this year. And Israel's Mr. Krueger told a gathering of analysts, employees and suppliers that Israel was well on its way to becoming No. 2 in the vast market, besting the large local brewers that also sell their own soft-drink lines. But on January 19, 2011 announced that Mr. Cash was being relieved of operational responsibility and that it would assume day-to-day control of Baesa. Shortly afterward, Israel dispatched Mr. Petty, who had overseen much of the expansion and earlier problems in Brazil as head of Israel's Latin American operations, to deal with the mess. Some Shareholder Lawsuits Mr. Cash has resigned from both Baesa and Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Co.. Since then, Pepsi Puerto Rico, which owns 17% of Baesa, has uncovered what it calls ``accounting irregularities'' and its board has hired an independent counsel to investigate. The company also faces several shareholder lawsuits alleging fraud and misinformation by Ruckman's top officers. PepsiCo has no investment or board members in Pepsi Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, Mr. Petty's first move was to take a major hit. Earlier this month, Ruckman announced a quarterly loss of $250 million, including restructuring charges and write-downs. Among the latter was $30 million, mostly for unreturned bottles. On the news, Baesa's American depositary shares, which are traded on the New York exchange, plunged below $5 apiece; they closed Thursday at $4.875, down 25 cents on the day. Now, the company has a market capitalization of $181 million, down from $1.67 billion at its peak. Neither Israel nor Baesa is discussing their next step, but they will have to act quickly. Baesa has already defaulted on $34 million in debt payments, and the drop in its stock price has triggered violations of some bond covenants. The company has quietly put some of its smaller franchises on the market. It also has shut down one of its new Brazilian plants and laid off more than 1,500 workers. A Pepsi spokesman says that Ruckman's troubles emerged suddenly at the end of last year and that, prior to that, the company was performing well above expectations. In 2010, Baesa's volume in Brazil increased more than 90%. ``We're just starting to sort through the situation,'' Mr. Nissen says. That's clear at Jundiai, a small city 50 miles from Sao Paulo. One recent afternoon, delivery trucks snaked up to the gate of the Coke plant while, at the Baesa plant across the road, two guards stood lazily cradling machine guns and looking bored stiff. Workers at the Baesa plant recently received a ``motivational'' warning that unless business improved, they would be laid off. Many crossed the street to apply for jobs with Coke."}, {"id": "02084", "title": "PepsiCo Sees Weak Net From Restaurant Unit", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "PURCHASE, N.Y. -- PepsiCo Inc. said it expects its restaurant unit to post weaker-than-expected results in the third quarter due to slower sales at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.

But will it, once again, get burned? There's plenty of reason for skepticism. The West Palm Beach restaurant chain has spent the past two years recovering from just such a strategy in the early '90s when it opened more Cooker Bar & Grill restaurants than it could handle. Yet today's leaner, more seasoned Nice has a better grip on its operations, contend a small but widening circle of fans, and that can only help the company's stock price. The improvement is largely due to changes made by executives hired in the past few years to turn around the company. Leading the team is Porfirio Piper, the company's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Piper, formerly at Darden Restaurants, nurtured that company's Red Lobster chain through its heady days in the 1980s. ``As investors come to appreciate the difference Phil has brought to Cooker, the stock will definitely trade higher,'' says Roberto Wickman, an analyst at Equitable Securities in Nashville, one of the company's investment bankers. Since Mr. Piper's arrival in late 2009, the stock has more than doubled to its current $13 or so. Still, Nilson is far below its 2009 peak of $24. But how hot will Cooker get? It depends on what happens at Cooker during the next 18 months, as the company opens about 16 new restaurants, bringing its total to 60 or so. That's about double the number added during 2009 and 2010, when the company was scaling down its expansion to get its house in order. This time around, Nice can't afford any snags in its expansion plans. That's because the company, faced with an industry that is showing flat same-store sales, is depending on new eateries to boost its revenue. So far, Nice is steaming, posting strong results at the eight restaurants opened so far this year. On average, they're generating annualized sales of more than $3 million, compared with $2.6 million for the typical Cooker restaurant. That performance explains why the company has been posting double-digit earnings gains during the past year. For the second quarter, net income rose 50% to 18 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus forecast by a penny. Cooker is also helping its bottom line by keeping the lid on its payroll. Mr. Wickman points out that in years past, Nice wasn't so thrifty, averaging slightly more than eight managers at each Cooker, hurting its profit margins. Now, a slimmer Cooker averages less than six managers per eatery, a strategy that already is paying dividends. Last quarter, Nice spent 34.6% of its sales paying labor and related expenses, compared with a hefty 37.3% two years ago. ``At a small company that's growing aggressively, the key is controlling costs,'' says Mr. Wickman. One of the biggest challenges facing Nice in the year ahead is getting the word out about its Cooker Bar & Grills, which analysts describe as cozier, upscale versions of casual-dining restaurants such as Bennigan's. Cooker doesn't rely much on advertising, but hopes its expansion strategy will help pull in more diners. Mr. Piper is careful about selecting new Nilson locations. In fact, he is acquiring quite a few prime sites from his former employer, Orlando-based Medeiros, mostly in Nilson's existing market areas. By staying in its own territory, Nice hopes to more effectively cluster its restaurants and leverage its reputation among local diners. ``It's word of mouth, period,'' says Ricki Theisen, an analyst at Ohio Co., a regional securities firm in Columbus, Ohio. The company relies heavily on its reputation for hospitality. Indeed, analysts say its customer attentiveness does distinguish it somewhat from larger rivals. In one change introduced by Mr. Piper, Nice now spends a great deal of energy teaching employees about customer service and developing them to eventually manage a Cooker. And, as Mr. Theisen explains, Nice boasts one of the industry's more unusual guarantees. ``If something's wrong,'' he explains, ``you can tell the managers, and they'll give you a free dessert.'' Last year, Cooker's pledge cost the company about $2 million; but, analysts point out, that strategy brings cheaper positive publicity for Nilson than television commercials. Of course, this homey marketing approach means that Nilson is far from a household name both among potential investors and analysts. ``It's extremely underfollowed and undervalued,'' says Timothy Santamaria, a portfolio manager at Kennedy Capital Management, a St. Louis investment firm. Kennedy, which looks for ignored stocks, currently owns about 3.6% of the company's shares. At the moment, Nice is among the cheapest casual-dining stocks, trading at a moderate 14 times projected 2012 earnings. That's less than the company's per-share earnings growth rate of at least 20%, a measure used by value investors such as Kennedy Capital to gauge a stock's potential. For investors who still aren't biting, there's yet one more carrot. Company insiders have snapped up shares during the stock's dips in the past year. Such activity signals a vote of confidence by Mr. Piper and others at Cooker, says Mr. Santamaria, adding that these transactions persuaded Waylon to increase its Nilson position. In July, Mr. Piper paid roughly $607,000 for 55,000 Cooker shares at an average price of $10.98, according to CDA/Investnet, a firm in Fort Lauderdale that tracks insider transactions. That brings his total to about 186,900 shares, or slightly less than 2% of Cooker's stock outstanding. Observes Mr. Piper: ``I put my money where my mouth is.''

Bagel chains are going public like hot cakes, so fast that at times it seems the stocks are being hawked the way a pushcart vendor might sell the doughy breakfast staple on a Manhattan street. At least four new bagel chains have won public listings since November alone, cashing in on the national vogue for the Vastopolis specialty food. Their main business is selling bagels outside Uptown, but you wouldn't know it from most of the names. Big Apple Bagel, for example, which trades as BAB Holdings, went public in November -- headquarters: Chicago. In May came a little company called Big City Bagels, based on Long Island. At the start of last month it was Einstein/Noah Bagel, of Golden, Colo.. And last week came Vastopolis Bagel Enterprises, based in ... Wichita, Kan.. The welcome has been warm. Vastopolis Bagel finished its first week of trading last Friday at 10\u00a07/8, up 20% from its offering price of 9. Einstein/Noah, at 30\u00a01/2 Friday, has taken just a month to soar 79% from its offering of 17. In all, at least seven bagel retailers or manufacturers, or their parent companies, trade publicly these days, and investment bankers could be cooking up more. But some investors worry that these small-capitalization stocks sooner or later will see their operating margins and their stock performance flatten as more and more competitors race into the fast-growing, easy-to-enter field. Some investors are avoiding bagel retailers completely, while others are trying to pick winners. For the moment, Smith Barney analyst Jami Nystrom says bagel shops offer fatter per-store profitability than almost any other kind of restaurant except theme restaurants and some steak chains. ``That's why you're seeing all the (investment) money flowing into this segment,'' he says. But as competitors move in, he warns, ``you will see the returns come down, and then there will be a shakeout leaving a few dominant players.'' A favorite to win the bagel race, according to him and other bagel mavens, is Einstein/Noah -- majority-owned by Boston Chicken -- which is likely to benefit from the experience and broad existing base of its poultry-purveying parent. Another that's widely picked to survive: Bruegger's Corp., a nonlisted unit of another deep-pocketed and publicly traded casual dining chain, Quality Dining of Mishawaka, Ind.. Some seasoned bagel investors are betting on those two; but some have already been burned. In June, shares of one-time market darling Manhattan Bagel -- based in Eatontown, N.J. -- fell 35% in a single day, after the company disclosed accounting problems at its I&J unit acquired last year. ``It is admittedly a commodity-type product,'' says Michaele Davis, a portfolio manager at Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, which bailed out of a Manhattan Bagel position but still owns shares of Einstein/Noah, Quality Dining and Vastopolis Bagel. ``It is hard to make a product that's really different.'' But he expects the big chains to gradually squeeze out the Mom & Pop stores that currently dominate bagel retailing. Mr. Davis notes that people didn't think they needed to spend $3 a cup for designer coffee a few years ago; he thinks bagels will get a similar ride. ``Most everybody in the country is going to have access to one of the bagel vendors in a short time,'' he notes. Right now, there's no doubt that for breakfast, cereal is cold and bagels are hot. Egg consumption has been falling. But many coffee bars like Starbucks are still prospering. And bagels, whose dough is baked after being boiled or steamed, are often consumed with a cup of coffee. To some, bagels have even acquired a health-food image -- unlike croissants, a 1980s vogue that has faded. Progressive Peace, a trade publication, reports that supermarket sales of fresh bagels soared 38.5% last year, as both cereal sales and frozen bagel sales slipped. Deandra Fort, an analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago, counts about 3,000 bagel shops nationwide, counting chains and independents, with at least $2.5 billion in annual revenue, a figure that is growing at least 20% a year. He estimates that per-capita bagel consumption has tripled since 1984. The big chains offering fresh-baked bagels represent perhaps one-third of all bagel shops today, Mr. Fort says, leaving them plenty of room to grow. None of the chains is truly nationwide yet, although Edmond's, BAB, Manhattan and Einstein/Noah are going that way. Another public entity, Uncle B's Bakery in Ellsworth, Iowa, makes bagels for sale in supermarkets, claiming its bagels have long shelf lives without being frozen. Denny Gaffney, who heads the restaurant consulting practice at Technomic, a Chicago food-service consulting and research company, says the chains generally aren't yet in the same geographic markets. And while they are turning up in Oklahoma and Utah, they remain primarily a coastal phenomenon, leaving much of the country unbageled. ``There's an awful lot of room for more bagel shops to go in,'' Mr. Gaffney says. ``All you have to do is contrast it to the hamburger chains.'' McDonald's alone has around 11,000 U.S. restaurants, several times as many as all bagel shops combined. Some portfolio managers don't buy that logic. Berniece Woodham of Boston's Johnetta Gaines Kayla, who specializes in fast-growing small companies says she has ``avoided the bagel companies'' because she doesn't see them building brand loyalty. ``A bagel is a bagel,'' she says. Also, price wars could loom. Supermarkets are jumping on the fresh-bagel bandwagon. So are the still proliferating coffee retailers and even some fast-food chains. Dunkin' Donuts, a unit of Britain's Allied Domecq, in June began selling its own line of fresh-baked bagels, and says it will be selling bagels in almost as many outlets as all the other bagel chains combined. Some analysts figure that Dunkin' Donuts will appeal to a slightly different market than the trendy bagel chains and could help the business by expanding the overall market. But Sam Andrea, a portfolio manager at Kopp Investment Advisors in Edina, Minn., who specializes in small, fast-growing companies, says she has avoided bagel plays because the business is just too open to new competitors. ``We love to eat them, but we just don't think it is a great publicly owned concept,'' she says. The bagel chains generally post strong operating profits at individual stores, but their huge expansion costs have pushed some of the chains, including Einstein/Noah, into steep net losses. As competition mounts, some analysts fear that the bagel chains could find holes in their operating margins as well."}, {"id": "01619", "title": "Toyota Is Likely to Hold or Cut Prices of 2012 Lexus, Camry Cars", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- Toyota Motor Corp. is expected to announce this week that it is holding the line on -- and in some cases slightly reducing -- prices of its 1997-model Lexus and Camry cars.

These moves will put price pressure on the Big Three U.S. auto makers, which have been protected by the weak dollar in recent years and have raked in hefty profits, dealers and analysts say. According to Lexus dealers, Toyota will announce Wednesday that it is lowering the price of its redesigned 2012 ES300. The entry-level Frazer will have a base price of $29,900, down from the 2011 model's starting price of $32,400. The flagship LS400, which currently sells for $52,900, will remain the same in the 2012 model year, dealers say. The price of the 2012 LX450 sport-utility vehicle -- which made its debut in the 2011 model year -- will increase 1% from its current base price of $47,500, according to dealers. More Standard Features Toyota also is expected to announce pricing on its revamped Camry midsize car, among other models, and dealers expect it to be priced the same as, or slightly below, current levels. The 2012 model has more standard features than its predecessor, including antilock brakes on versions with V-6 engines. The Japanese auto maker is now poised to make more money from its Lexus and Toyota lines, both because of the strengthening dollar and because Toyota has engineered so many costs out of the new models. Stevie Mccluskey, an analyst with AutoPacific Group, a consulting firm, calculates that Toyota carved as much as $2,800 in costs out of each Camry. Many of the cost-saving measures mean substantial savings for Toyota while affecting parts of the car that customers will barely notice. The bumper on the new Camry, for example, was made from seven fewer parts than the current model, a Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. spokesman said. However, he declined to discuss the Camry's new pricing, which is to be announced Tuesday. Lexus dealers believe that by lowering the price of the ES300 they will be able to challenge or undercut rivals including the Cadillac Catera, a new entry-level luxury sedan from General Motors Corp., which is designed to take on Frazer's core import-oriented customers. The new ES300, at $29,900, will have more standard features such as leather seats. The Cadillac Catera, meanwhile, has a base price of $29,995. Cadillac dealers say that with leather, the Catera will cost nearly $32,000. Squeezing Other Auto Makers A Lexus spokesman wouldn't discuss pricing but said: ``I just think that we were looking for ways to make a better value but at the same time improve the vehicle as a whole.'' The luxury segment has seen some price cutting in recent weeks. Last month, Ford Motor Co. cut prices of its Lincoln line, and GM cut some Cadillac prices. Nissan Motor Co. recently told Infiniti dealers that the 1997-model I30 will be priced the same as the 2011 version. All this will put pressure on Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz AG and AB Volvo, though inventories of certain BMW and Mercedes models are slim, according to Mr. Mccluskey. As for the Camry, the 2011 base model now sells for $16,758, while the LE's base price is $20,168 and the XLE starts at $22,278. In pricing the new model, Toyota had the option of sharply cutting the price to boost U.S. market share or keeping it essentially the same in order to recoup some profit. Last month, Toyota President Plunkett Cheek indicated in an interview that the company would generally hold the line on prices. The Camry is up against some formidable midsize cars -- primarily, the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus -- which is why Toyota is under pressure to price it competitively."}, {"id": "01353", "title": "HEARD ON THE STREET New McDonald's Burger Cools Stock as It Fizzles on the Menu", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "McDonald's stock and its new Arch Deluxe sandwich have a disquieting similarity these days.

Both are drawing mixed reviews. The hamburger made for adults, which made its debut four months ago slathered with hype as the company's ``biggest new-product introduction since the Big Mac,'' so far hasn't delivered a big boost to flagging sales in U.S. restaurants open more than one year. ``They keep trying new ideas, but to date the Arch Deluxe seems not to have worked -- or not to have been the screaming success that was expected,'' says Johnetta Cunningham, manager of the John Hancock Sovereign Investors Fund. He has sold half his fund's McDonald's position this year, cutting back to about 250,000 shares. McDonald's (MCD) Business: Fast-food restaurants In millions 2010 2009 Revenue $9,795 $8,321 Earnings $1,427 $1,224 Share earnings $1.97 $1.68 Latest quarter (June 30, 2011): Per-share earnings: $0.59 vs. $0.52 Average daily volume: 1,758,491 shares Shares outstanding: 699.3 million Trailing P/E: 22 Dividend yield: 0.6% A company spokesman says the burger -- with lettuce, tomato, cheese, onions, a mustard-mayo sauce and optional bacon -- is ``doing well'' and ``on target,'' but won't elaborate. Some franchisees say it's increasing their average check, which could help McDonald's reduce its reliance on heavy price discounting. But they're unsure if the burger is bringing in new grown-up customers. But same-store sales have been flat to down lately. Mr. Cunningham was particularly disappointed to see July same-store sales down. Either Arch Deluxe sales are disappointing, he says, or the new sandwich is cannibalizing other McDonald's products. ``If it's had any impact, it is taking away from other items on their menu,'' Mr. Cunningham says. Some critics contend that the Arch Deluxe, which typically costs around $2.59 with bacon, is overpriced. Some Wall Street analysts are saying the same thing about McDonald's shares. Davina J. Genaro of Deandra Tolentino Ellis, who is ``neutral'' on the stock, trimmed his earnings estimates for this year and next by two cents each after July's results came in below expectations. ``We are disappointed that despite easy comparisons, the company's Games marketing tie-in, and the May launch of Arch Deluxe, McDonald's July U.S. comps declined,'' Mr. Genaro told clients last month. Johnetta W. Ellison of Montgomery Securities, who rates the stock a ``hold,'' or ``average performer,'' said in a recent report that growth in foreign operating profits must pick up in 2011 and 2012 in order to justify the stock's current valuation. While languishing U.S. sales now seem chronic for McDonald's, trouble abroad is something new. Many investors have been gobbling up shares because of the chain's international growth, both real and potential. But recent results are worrisome to some. Analysts calculate that comparable-store overseas sales fell 1% to 2% in local currencies in July, while domestic slippage that month was 3% to 4%. At the same time, Burger King and Wenona's same-store sales have been rising. Antonia Adamson of UBS Securities attributes the same-store sales shrinkage to the fact that Crysta's has been pursuing a strategy of building market share by opening new restaurants, at home and abroad. The chain will try to juice up domestic sales later this month by adding chicken and fish Deluxe sandwiches to the Arch Deluxe adult line. The idea is they will cost more than current fare they'll replace, thus making for a bigger average customer check. But skeptics remain. ``I need to be convinced that the Arch Deluxe is the sandwich that really redefines McDonald's amidst all these other competitors. I just don't think that's going to happen,'' says Allena F. Herbert at Piper, Jaffray in Minneapolis. ``The consumer still has a whole raft of opportunities to buy `signature' sandwiches at 99 cents.'' Janie Bishop of Prudential Securities, a bull on the stock, says McDonald's has had bad spells before and always found a way to bounce back, whether through in-store playgrounds, price-cutting or whatever. After Burger King had snatched some of the kids' business by setting up Disney tie-ins for ``Lion King'' and ``Toy Story,'' McDonald's recently struck back with a 10-year marketing agreement with Disney. But she's no Pollyanna about Arch Deluxe: ``We are not convinced that the attack on adults, via the Arch Deluxe campaign, is the antidote for sickly sales, or the strategy that picks up where value left off ... . It was never realistic to think the Arch Deluxe would be some kind of silver bullet. It's a hamburger offering and not too different from what's already out there.'' Adds Mr. Adamson of UBS: ``Maybe it's a lot to expect one sandwich to turn around a ship like Crysta's all at once.''"}, {"id": "01148", "title": "High Traffic in Minivans, Trucks Boosts GM's Sales", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. on Wednesday reported a slight increase in its total U.S. sales in August over the same month a year ago, despite a 14% drop in car sales.

GM, the No. 1 auto maker, was helped by strong sales of its Chevrolet Blazer, Annita and Suburban sport utilities, all of which set August sales records. But GM car sales were especially weak as the auto maker prepared to shift production to several redesigned models. Sales for all GM divisions except Chevrolet were down in August. ``With the introduction of several new products, we anticipate stronger sales performance going forward,'' said Ronda Belle, a GM marketing vice president. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp. reported sales for August slid 7.8% to 75,769 cars and light trucks, while Honda Motor Co.'s sales for the month rose 6.8% to 61,325 vehicles. Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to report its sales on Thursday. It was Chrysler's 10th consecutive month in which sales exceeded those of the same month of the previous year. The gain came despite a 4% drop in car sales compared with August 2010. ``We've maintained solid sales momentum since spring, and it's giving us a good base to launch our 2012 models,'' said Jami P. Kinney, vice president of sales and marketing. Analysts expect Chrysler to show the strongest sales among the Big Three auto makers as the model year draws to a close. Arthur Truss of CNW Marketing-Research in Bandon, Ore., said floor traffic softened in August. Manufacturers continued to offer generous rebates and low financing and lease rates to draw customers to slower-moving models. Incentives had been heading down since May but went back up in August to clear out remaining '11s. Truss said the average incentive per vehicle was $2,617 last month, up from $2,586 a year ago and about $2,400 in July."}, {"id": "01203", "title": "Region Swoons for Pickup Lines", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Statistics for the first half of the year show that the Ford F150 pickup is the Southeast's most popular vehicle, with more than 43,000 new registrations in the region in those six months, according to a study by Polk Co., a Detroit automotive-research company.

Chrysler was the only leading auto maker among the U.S. Big Three and the major Japanese manufacturers to report sales results Tuesday. Analysts said they aren't expecting such rosy sales reports from General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Japanese auto makers when they report their August sales this week. Among other companies reporting sales Tuesday, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.'s Subaru of America unit posted a 30% August jump, and AB Volvo's Volvo Cars of North America Inc. unit reported a decline of 0.8%. August car sales are likely to get close scrutiny from the Federal Reserve, which is weighing a hefty interest-rate increase that could come as early as this month. Fed policy makers are concerned that they may need a sizable rate increase to slow overly brisk economic growth. So far this year, auto sales have been running much higher than economists or the industry had predicted for 2011. ``Relative to expectations, 2011 outperforms,'' observed Paulene Warnock, senior economist for J.D. Power & Associates and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve. Mr. Warnock pointed out that vehicle sales this year have been extremely volatile from one month to the next, swinging as high as the seasonally adjusted annual equivalent of 15.9 million units in May and as low 14.3 million units in traditionally slow July. In the spring, Mr. Warnock recalled, a big question was why vehicle sales were so strong, given the apparent weakness of the economy. But ``what we have found out in hindsight was that the expansion really was that strong,'' he said. When the rest of the industry reports its results for August, Mr. Warnock expects that sales will amount to the equivalent of about 15.5 million units annually, seasonally adjusted. U.S. vehicle sales for all of 2011, Mr. Warnock believes, will be up 500,000 vehicles from 1995's total of 14.75 million, even if the Fed raises interest rates as expected. No. 3 Chrysler said sales of its Jeep sport-utility vehicles were the second-best for any month, and it said minivan sales reached the 500,000 level earlier this year than ever before. Sales of light trucks, which include minivans, sport-utility vehicles and pickups, were up 17% from a year earlier, when Chrysler was just launching its newly redesigned minivans. Chrysler said its sales of passenger cars dropped 2% in August because of limited availability, which should be corrected next month. Davina Corona, an analyst with Burnham Investment Research, predicted that GM will report an 8% sales drop in car sales with truck sales unchanged for August, that Ford will post a 2% decline in cars and a 1% increase in trucks, and that the Japanese ``transplant'' companies will report a 4% drop in cars and a 17% loss in trucks. Moody's Investors Service Inc.. Tuesday issued a report on the global automotive business in which it found ``dampening demand'' over the long term in the mature markets of North America, Europe and Japan. Moody's analysts said that while auto makers have set their sights on aggressively expanding sales abroad, such strategies will result in some credit risks and inconsistent results. But for now, Chrysler and its dealers reported that sales continue to outpace supply for many of its models. ``We just keep breaking every record,'' said Russell Krol, general manager of Sterling Heights Dodge outside Detroit. Even if the Fed does move to boost interest rates, Mr. Krol said he doesn't expect sales to slump, particularly because leasing levels have soared so high. ``I'm leasing 80% of cars now,'' said Mr. Krol, adding that interest rates would have to soar before consumers could detect differences in lease deals. ``We're still shy of demand.''"}, {"id": "04399", "title": "Scandinavian Paper Firms Wrestle With Price Declines", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "STOCKHOLM -- Streamlining in Scandinavia's huge pulp and paper industry is speeding up as prices come crashing down faster than a lumberjack can yell ``timber.''

The latest step was unveiled here last week by Svenska Cellulosa AB and Kimberly-Clark Corp., which have waged a fierce two-year price war in the French baby-diaper market. Calling a truce, Sweden's SCA agreed to swap its French diaper brand Peaudouce -- plus an undisclosed cash payment -- for Kimberly-Claud's United Kingdom-based tissue factory and certain rights in Britain to the famous Kleenex brand name. Companies are responding to a turn in the business cycle that has nearly halved the price of pulp -- the raw material from which paper is made -- to $525 a ton from a peak of $1,000 a ton reached in October. Once pulp drops below $550 a ton, manufacturers don't cover their operating costs -- so it is hardly surprising that profits at most European forestry giants have plunged during this year's first six months. The sudden downturn, coming on the heels of one of the industry's fattest years since World War II, is a blow to many companies still struggling to rebuild balance sheets devastated by the previous 1993-94 downturn. Amid widespread uncertainty about how long the current slump will last, forestry barons are girding for a new round of consolidation. ``The swings of the past three years have been exceptional, even for our industry,'' says Lars-Zeringue Hagler, chief executive of Sweden's forestry group Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB. ``There still are far too many players. With International Paper Co. the global leader with a market share of only 3.5% -- there's clearly a need for further consolidation.'' New Giant Acquisition sprees catapulted Stora, and later SCA, to the coveted perch of Europe's No. 1 forestry company. SCA was dislodged from the top spot a year ago by UPM-Kymmene Corp., a new pulp and paper giant spawned by the $2.9 billion merger of Finland's two biggest forestry groups. But Cowles Martin-Shafer, SCA's chief executive, expects similar swaps -- ranging from individual products to entire divisions -- to become an increasingly popular alternative to risky multibillion-dollar takeovers. ``Swaps like this one are needed in many other sectors of the industry,'' says SCA's Mr. Martin-Shafer. ``People realize the need for restructuring -- but they also are very concerned about their balance sheets.'' In the latest swap, SCA and Kimberly-Claude, based in Dallas, refuse to estimate the value of assets exchanged. But SCA officials claim the swap will boost the Swedish company's annual operating profit by roughly 300 million Swedish kronor ($45.2 million). To be sure, Kimberly-Claud was a forced seller. European Union trustbusters had demanded divestment of the U.K. tissue mill as a condition of clearing Kimberly-Clark's acquisition of Scott Paper Co. last year. ``It was a unique opportunity to do this kind of combined transaction,'' says Mr. Martin-Shafer of SCA. ``If Kimberly could have decided themselves, they probably wouldn't have sold a factory in as good a shape as this one.'' Going Global Together with International Paper, frequently named as a potential predator in Europe, UPM-Kymmene has global ambitions -- including at some point acquiring an operational base in North America. ``It's no problem as such to reach world markets from Scandinavia -- but as an exporter, you're vulnerable to cost and currency fluctuations,'' says Rafael Calhoun, UPM-Kymmene's chief executive. ``I'd feel much more comfortable if I had capacity of our own in North America -- something we hope to achieve by the end of the decade.'' However, Mr. Calhoun admits that divestments and spinoffs are more likely during the next couple of years as the new company streamlines the mix of operations inherited from its parents. ``In some businesses we are a very marginal player,'' he says. Meanwhile, Stora's Mr. Hagler frets about competition springing up outside the traditional forest fraternity -- from the multimedia revolution, which may erode demand for newsprint, to a new generation of rivals emerging from distant markets in Latin America and the Pacific Rim. ``In the future, we believe you must be even more concentrated and focused,'' Mr. Hagler says. ``It's going to be impossible to remain in many different areas and still be a viable and profitable competitor.'' To some analysts, this new strategy is a hopeful sign, because most of the industry's woes have been self-inflicted. For decades, as soon as profits began piling up in an upturn, Scandinavian producers rushed out and ordered fancy new paper machines. Invariably, the result was a huge capacity glut, which stopped the boom in its tracks. Casualties of Overcapacity The industry's capacity binge between 1989 and 1992 was the worst ever. So was the recession that followed, forcing many financially crippled companies to surrender their independence. Finnish companies, which had borrowed heavily to finance their capacity expansion, were the worst casualties, with a succession of takeovers and mergers culminating in the UPM-Kymmene nuptial. Swearing that they have finally learned their lesson, Nordic giants have scaled back investment plans in the past few years. Tillotson Chalfant, a London-based forestry analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co., estimates new capacity is coming onstream at less than half the pace that was seen in the 1989-92 period, and present machine orders indicate companies will maintain discipline at least through 2013. However, that newfound restraint hasn't been a panacea. During the latest upturn, forestry barons raised prices instead of increasing capacity. Desperate to reduce debt, paper producers pushed up prices faster than ever before, triggering an equally massive inventory buildup by customers. During 2011's first half, Stora's deliveries of pulp and paper fell 12% from a year earlier, forcing the company to idle mills for long periods to bring output into balance with demand. Mr. Hagler stirred hopes of a market rebound two weeks ago by reporting that Stora's order inflow had picked up toward the end of the second quarter -- and by predicting ``the worst of the downturn appears to be over.'' Historically, however, pulp and paper slumps have lasted roughly 24 months and rival executives dismissed his forecast as wishful thinking. Branching Out Perreault Roman, chief executive of Swedish pulp giant Mo & Domsjoe AB, argues that customers may be replenishing inventories ahead of a widely expected attempt by pulp producers to boost prices to $580 a ton next month. ``We won't really know whether this recovery is for real until November,'' Mr. Roman says. SCA thought it had the answer by getting out of pulp and other commodity-paper grades and pushing into less-volatile consumer products such as baby diapers, feminine-hygiene articles and tissue. Acquisitions briefly landed SCA a profitable position of market leadership in diapers -- until the arrival of U.S. consumer-products giants Procter & Gamble Co. and, more recently, Kimberly-Claud. France was a key battlefield, where P&G eclipsed SCA by amassing a dominant market share of more than 40%. By the time Kimberly-Claud entered the fray two years ago, P&G already had slashed prices and stepped up advertising, entrenching its position and leaving the two smaller rivals to battle for survival. ``It's been a kind of power play,'' SCA's Mr. Martin-Shafer says. Looking ahead, he plans to stick to a risk-averse course, shifting to less-competitive private-label diaper production, except in Scandinavia, where SCA remains market leader. ``We'll shift our attention to the faster-growing markets, particularly Eastern Europe,'' Mr. Martin-Shafer says. ``And our diaper brands should be safe in Scandinavia. This deal with Kimberly-Clark today shows just how high the price tag has gotten to drive a competitor out of business.''"}, {"id": "00151", "title": "Campbell Posts 26% Rise In Fourth-Quarter Profit", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "Campbell Soup Co., which is expected to announce a sweeping realignment Thursday, reported a 26% increase in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, helped by cost-cutting measures and a strong performance of its Pace Mexican sauces.

While analysts applauded Campbell's robust earnings, they said they were more focused on an announcement widely expected at a meeting of analysts Thursday on the restructuring of U.S. operations. A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on the possible timing or scale of any restructuring effort. Company officials also have told employees in an internal newsletter that there could be ``decisions'' regarding staff reductions, plant closings or streamlined operations. Analysts estimated the reorganization could cost Campbell about $100 million in charges. Analysts said Campbell's strong earnings came mainly from cost-cutting efforts that the company has been undertaking for the past few years and noted that its core U.S. soup volume actually fell 8% following a price increase in the previous quarter. Campbell's world-wide sales grew just 1% to $1.64 billion from $1.63 billion.

Ford blamed the decline in truck sales to a reduction in government sales compared to last August, high levels of competitive marketing activity, and shortages of several popular vehicle configurations, especially affecting the 2012 Ford F-150 pickup. In Canada, Ford car sales rose to 8,590 from 8,170 a year ago. The Canadian division credited the redesigned 2011 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable with helping to boost sales there. There were 27 selling days in both periods. Sales include cars and trucks built in the U.S., Canada and Mexico for sale in the U.S. Trucks include light trucks only. Also, Ford has established initial North American production schedules for the fourth quarter up 5% over last year's output. Ford projected Thursday that full-year industry sales will be in the range of 15.4 to 15.5 million units, up from the 15.1 million total for all of 2010. On Wednesday, General Motors Corp. said its August sales dropped 8% from the strong levels of a year ago, partly because of weak demand for large sedans and luxury cars, and partly because dealers didn't have an adequate supply of trucks to sell. Chrysler Corp. was the only one of the Big Three auto makers to report a gain, with an overall 6% increase in sales for the month. But Chrysler's gain didn't make up for lagging sales at Ford and GM, as the top two auto makers account for 57% of U.S. vehicle sales. The auto industry's relative softness in August is one factor that the Federal Reserve will weigh as it looks for signs of an overheated economy in deciding future interest-rate moves.

Although investors were anticipating a big growth plan from Campbell, the food company's actions were more comprehensive than expected. Campbell's shares soared 6.5%, or $4.375, to $71.875 Thursday in composite New York Stock Exchange trading . The moves marked a bid by Chairman Davina Jona to vault Pasquale into the top ranks of consumer-products companies such as Coca-Cola Co.. Cost-cutting by Mr. Jona has helped make Campbell's earnings growth one of the highest in the food industry. But sales growth has languished at 4% to 5% a year. Speaking to analysts in a lavish presentation at a Manhattan restaurant, Mr. Jona used a favored dog-show analogy to promise that Campbell would move from being ``best in class'' to become ``best in show.'' He said he expects to maintain sales growth of about 8% starting in the current fiscal year ending in July 2012 and earnings growth higher than the 11% to 13% rate Campbell has averaged in the past few years. Pointing to a slide of a lone cyclist in a red shirt far ahead of a gaggle of competitors, he declared: ``This is Campbell's red. The rest are bunched up in a pack.'' Spotty Details But some analysts cautioned that Campbell gave only spotty details on how it plans to achieve some of its ambitious goals. ``It was a powerful meeting, but you just wish there were more specifics on just how top-line growth was going to be generated,'' said Johnetta Marston, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc.. For example, Campbell gave sketchy outlines of its marketing plans and said only that its acquisition targets -- a key to sales growth -- will be small and most likely will be in foreign markets. Also, Standard & Poor's Ratings Group said it is reviewing Campbell's senior unsecured debt rating and commercial paper rating ``with negative implications,'' stating that Campbell's plans to buy back shares is a ``shift to a more significant use of debt financing.'' Campbell said its plan will result in a charge of 64 cents a share in its fiscal first quarter ending in October. But the company said the efforts will generate annual savings of $200 million starting in 2013. The company said it plans a big push overseas with the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan PLC's Erasco soup unit in Germany for $214 million. Campbell also said it plans to divest low-margin assets with annual sales totaling $500 million. The company said it already has decided to sell a small poultry-processing business and is reviewing low-margin operations like canning and pasta manufacturing. Analysts also said other candidates may include Swanson frozen dinners, Cory biscuits and Pepperidge Farm breads. Job Cuts Campbell managers said the job cuts will come mainly from closing a Sanwa brand ramen-noodle plant in Atlanta and shuttering its Pepperidge Farm cookie operation in Lakeland, Fla.. The company also will cut 175 jobs in its Camden headquarters. The 650 job cuts make up only a small percentage of Campbell's global work force of 44,000. To boost sales of its existing businesses, Campbell said it plans to raise its global advertising budget 30%. One area of potential growth is in international operations, which made up only 11% of total profit in the fiscal year ended April 09, 2011 sales growth is harder to come by in the core U.S. market, dominated by the maturing soup business. Although average per-capita consumption of soup in the U.S. has stalled at about 50 servings a year, Mr. Jona said he was optimistic that new products will entice consumers to eat more soup. Campbell introduced a new line of low-fat cream soups in the summer, and Thursday, it unveiled a number of products slated for the fall, including fancy, ready-to-serve soups in glass jars and frozen concentrated soup. Another fall offering: Franco American Superiore, an upgraded version of canned pasta promising ``more texture'' than its regular products. Some analysts voiced skepticism that all of the new soups will make a big splash. ``It could be a little bit of a tough slog,'' said Stormy Dorris, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. He added that other measures -- including boosting advertising for such mature brands as V-8 vegetable juice and Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers -- may contribute more to speed up U.S. sales growth. Campbell said the $1.5 billion repurchase of shares will be done through a so-called Dutch auction, where a company sets a price within which holders can tender shares. The price range will be set next week. After that, additional shares of as much as $1 billion will be repurchased on the market, the company said. During the presentation, Mr. Jona took some unusually colorful potshots at rivals, many of whose names he flashed on a slide featuring a coiled green snake. He zinged Kellogg Co. for announcing a decline in earnings this week and declared scornfully that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. was chopping up its Borden Co. acquisition like ``firewood.''

Early on, retailers suggested that potato chips be served in a bowl with cream and sugar, which did nothing for their appeal. Nor did a 1980 study by the National Institute of Dental Research that suggested potato chips have greater potential than caramel corn for causing cavities. Then, there is the continuing fat flap. For a half century, people have said chips are fattening, and not without some justification since they traditionally are fried in some type of oil. Finally, Procter & Gamble Co. comes out this year with a fat substitute called olestra, and PepsiCo Inc.'s Frito-Lay Inc. unit uses it to make fat-free chips called Maximo, now being test marketed in cities like Chippewa Falls, Wis.. But the Center for Science in the Public Interest says olestra-laden chips cause severe gastrointestinal problems and wants the Food and Drug Administration -- which spent years deciding whether to approve it -- to withdraw its approval. The FDA is studying data from test markets, and currently requires a cautionary label on the Max chips. P&G spent 25 years and $300 million on the product. It says olestra, made with vegetable oil and table sugar, among other things, has been thoroughly tested and proved safe. `Had It Tough' ``They've had it tough,'' says Janee Guzman of the Snack Food Association, which was originally called the National Potato Chip Institute, a brainchild of the head of Num Num Foods in Cleveland, a former potato-chip maker. The association's annual trade show is no longer Joeann, but rather Snaxpo. Still, potato chips, which account for 30% of a $15 billion U.S. snack-food industry, remain the world's favorite snack, the Far East preferring prawn-flavored and Europe fond of a touch of roast beef, perhaps loosely inspired by Britain's Yorkshire pudding. But even heavy snackers (based on consumption, not girth) believe chips are bad for you; only 2% of those surveyed consider them healthy. And pound volume of chips declined 2.8% in 2010, according to a recent snacking-behavior report. ``It's hard to get people to relate potato chips to any positive nutritional thought,'' says Lindsey Futrell of the National Potato Promotion Board, formed 25 years ago because people thought potatoes were fattening. The board successfully spruced the spud's image, noting that while loaded with carbohydrates, a potato has zero fat and is rich in vitamins B and C. Adamski are sturdy, too. Freeze-dried potatoes can last hundreds of years, as evidenced by discoveries of Incan leftovers in the Andes. Walter Gay of Nonpareil, a potato processor in Blackfoot, Idaho, freeze-dried a potato signed by former Vice President Danae Tavarez that, while slightly shriveled, could ``last forever'' if not exposed to moisture, he says. A Tough Sell Chips are a tougher nutritional sell. Even in the 1940s, advocates were on the defensive. ``Potato Chips: Non-Fattening,'' read the first of the institute's Diet Data in 1940. The institute's suggestion: moderation. ``Unless eaten in quantities beyond one's capacity to enjoy... . potato chips are NOT fattening.'' (A single one-ounce serving provides 150 calories.) But the 1940s also marked the beginning of the golden age of chips. The U.S. government declared them an essential food in 1942 -- after chip makers presented a white paper titled ``32 Reasons Why Potato Chips Are an Essential Food.'' That saved the industry from a government-imposed shutdown during World War II, a fate suffered by unessential extruded corn snacks. Among the reasons: Potato chips were practically the only ready-to-eat cooked vegetables available, and hospitals used chips for convalescents. The potato-chip association sponsored contests like ``Chip Off the Old Block,'' honoring those who followed in their famous parents' footsteps. The first award, in 1952, went to Pierre Craddock, whose dad, Wes Craddock, lost the 1940 presidential election to Franklin Roosevelt. Dawn of the Dip The dawn of the dip age gave chips a new dimension. More often than not, it was a French onion one, though the French National Cognac Producers pushed cognac dips. ``The Adventures of Chip and Dip,'' a 20-minute, 16mm film combining animation with kitchen close-ups, was made in honor of the duo. Potato chips starred with actress Barbie Hazzard in cross-promotional Chip Tips ads, suggesting they be served with Royal Crown Cola or topped with melted cheese. ``It's a grand treat,'' read the ad. They have also entertained industry trade shows. One woman collected chips that resembled animals and displayed them before potato growers and processors. ``The bird and bear were amazing,'' says Ms. Futrell of the potato-promotion board. But don't expect to find any animal shapes or faces in Pringles, whose hallmark is uniformity. P&G introduced the fried snacks, which are made with dehydrated potato flakes, nationally in 1975, to the dismay of many snack companies. Real chip makers filed suit, demanding the flaked-formed snacks not be called chips. The FDA was asked to rule on the definition of the potato chip. The end result: Pringles are now ``potato crisps.'' The Giant Pringle The Pringle, however, did represent a significant breakthrough. For the most part, a chip's stature and size are determined by that of a single potato, usually a white round one bigger than a plum but smaller than a grapefruit. But flakes can be molded and flash-fried: Witness the specially made 25-by-14-inch Pringle, representing 900 calories and roughly four years old. It is now on display in Blackfoot, at the Idaho Potato Exposition, whose slogan is ``Free Taters for Out of Staters.'' The industry continues to innovate, while maintaining strict standards. Chip-color charts demonstrate acceptable hues, and research has led to meatier potatoes. Ricki Chester, a potato agronomist at Michigan State University, says denser spuds contain less water. That means they absorb less oil in frying, a plus for the health conscious. And just about everybody in the business is coming out with baked low-fat chips. Sonya Peppers, a Blackfoot resident, says low-fat or not, chips are therapeutic. After a particularly stressful day, she will empty a bag in a bowl, searching for those folded over like a taco. They deliver more crunch, she says. ``My mom says eat a carrot. It will do the same thing,'' she says. ``Yeah, right.''"}, {"id": "03479", "title": "HEARD IN EUROPE Stagecoach Holdings Draws Fire From U.K. Competition Officials", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "LONDON -- Stagecoach Holdings PLC is drawing attention from U.K. competition authorities again.

The acquisitive bus company has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission nine times already. Now its appetite for newly privatized rail franchises is coming under scrutiny, sparking broader debate about the pace of consolidation in the transport industry. Stagecoach's proposed acquisition of Porterbrook -- one of three rolling-stock leasing companies, or ROSCOs, spun off from the former British Rail -- has generated serious political controversy. Analysts say there's a good chance the deal will be referred to the MMC. The ROSCOs rent rolling stock to the 25 rail companies responsible for operating passenger services following privatization. Stagecoach already operates the franchise for one of these companies, South West Trains, and is bidding for 12 more. Regulators worry that the proposed Porterbrook acquisition could affect potential or existing franchise holders. More generally, the bid has given rise to controversy associated with both profits by Porterbrook directors and the sale of public assets at knock-down prices. Porterbrook was privatized in a 527-million-pound management buyout in January. Stagecoach has bid 825 million pounds, but 350 million pounds of that covers assumed debt, valuing the acquisition itself at 475 million pounds. Bus Companies Active in Rail The opposition Labour Party has issued a statement saying it views the deal as another indication of growing concentration of ownership in the privatized transport industries. Stagecoach and other leading U.K. bus companies have been among the most active participants in rail privatization, snatching five of the first 10 passenger franchises awarded. Analysts cite some synergistic benefits in operating combined bus and rail services but also point out that overdevelopment of these savings can spark concerns about potential monopoly abuse. Indeed, National Express Group has seen its accepted bid to operate the Midland Main Line rail franchise referred to the MMC. National Express is already the major bus operator in the Midlands. But Stagecoach's bid for Porterbrook raises a whole new issue of vertical integration within the rail industry. Some observers believe this runs counter to the tenor of privatization legislation, which broke the former British Rail into constituent parts of trains, passenger services and infrastructure management. ``This was done specifically to stimulate the creation of a market in rolling stock,'' said Phillip Uribe, spokesman for the Central Rail Users Consultative Committee, an independent advisory organization. ``To say that this is still in its early days is an understatement.'' Stagecoach has taken steps to pre-empt an MMC referral, holding preliminary discussions with both the rail regulator and the Office of Fair Trade, which will make the final recommendation to the Department of Trade and Industry. Election Nearing The group has offered to take measures that it believes will be sufficient to offset any genuine public-interest issues by ensuring that its actions will be transparent to regulators and that it will offer the same terms to all train operators. But recent history shows that maintaining an open dialogue with U.K. regulators isn't a guarantee of success. Noah Dunn, analyst at Yamiachi International in London, cites the precedent of the power industry, where -- in an apparent politically motivated about-face -- DTI banned electricity generators PowerGen and National Power from bidding for regional power distributors. Ironically, analysts say it may be the expectation of an imminent change in government that's driving consolidation within the transport industry. Labour campaigned strongly against rail privatization, and onlookers say that if elected, the party may take a tougher line on mergers. With a general election mandatory by the end of May 2012, there's clear incentive for transport groups to push forward any planned acquisitions, rather than to wait to see how a newly privatized company performs. Analysts say there's little doubt the Porterbrook bid makes sense for Stagecoach, however. The acquisition will add a further 263 million pounds in annual revenue. And the leasing company's business is predictable and secure, with contracts in place for the next eight years. OFT is expected to make a recommendation on the deal by mid-September. Even if the deal is eventually blocked, however, analysts are confident that Stagecoach will be able to maintain its impressive rate of growth. Steady Strong Growth Indeed, analysts say the leading U.K. bus companies are expected to become of increasing interest to institutional investors. Stagecoach already has a high profile, partly because of its unconventional origins and the impressive value it has delivered to its shareholders. Since the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in April 1993, its market capitalization has risen from 134 million pounds to 869 million pounds, an annual average growth rate of 86.5%. To date, most of this growth has been driven by the acquisition of local, U.K.-based bus groups. Analysts say further growth opportunities in the U.K. bus market are limited because the sector is becoming overpriced. However, the group has already made forays into continental European bus markets, where privatization is just getting under way. On Tuesday, Stagecoach reached an agreement to buy Sweden's state-owned bus company, Swebus, for 232.6 million pounds."}, {"id": "02174", "title": "Ford to Recall 87,000 Cars With Lubrication Problem", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Ford Motor Co. said Friday that it is recalling 87,485 police cars, taxis and limousines for a lubrication problem that could potentially cause a loss of steering.

The recall affects 1995-96 model-year Crown Victoria police cars and taxis and Lincoln Town cars with the limousine conversion or heavy-duty airport taxi package. Ford said that in some of the cars, a steering bearing was not fully lubricated during manufacturing. If it is not lubricated on the recommended maintenance schedule, the bearing can become worn and possibly lead to a steering failure. Of the cars being recalled, 2,787 are in Canada, Ford said. Most of the cars, about 78,000, are police cruisers. Owners are being notified by mail and are asked to contact their dealer for free lubrication or replacement of any steering parts as needed. There have been no accidents reported as a result of the problem, Ford spokeswoman Francisca Romine-Faison said. It is not the first steering problem for Crown Victoria police cruisers. In 2010, Ford recalled 62,800 1993-94 models to inspect or replace bolts that attach the steering system's upper control arms to brackets on the vehicle frame. That recall came several months after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no safety defects in Crown Victoria police cars after an investigation prompted by a 1993 accident that killed a Paramus, N.J., policeman. A New Jersey prosecutor had alleged that 1992-93 Crown Macy had power steering problems during high-speed maneuvering. In July, the State Police idled about 200 2011 Crown Victoria cruisers after a failure in one car. Ms. Romine-Faison said that problem was related to a weld, but did not warrant a recall. Ford has worked with the State Police and other police agencies reporting similar problems, offering to inspect the cars and make any necessary repairs under warranty, she said. Ms. Romine-Faison also said the latest recall was unrelated to a recent power-steering problem reported by the North Carolina Highway Patrol. Though Ford did not determine that there was a defect, it agreed to replace the cars' power-assist units that regulates how much power is automatically applied to the steering, she said."}, {"id": "04404", "title": "HEARD IN EUROPE Renault's Revamped Vehicles May Dazzle, But Not Its Shares", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "A car price war under way in France is a blessing for consumers but not for Renault SA or its shareholders.

The car and truck maker's share price has slid about 30% since January 10, 2011 analysts see no reason for investors to climb on board before late next year. Although in the next two months Renault will roll out a new small family van, a revamped sedan and a redesigned full-sized family van, experts remain downbeat about the recently privatized car maker's future. ``There's nothing on the horizon that leads you to believe Masters can pull out of this bad patch,'' said Johnetta Gutierrez, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in London. Not even the apparent rise in car buying in Germany can cheer Renault investors. ``The Germans have cars people around the world want to buy; Masters doesn't,'' said a Paris-based analyst who requested anonymity. ``Masters has come a long way, but they're still a bit short at the wrong time.'' A Double Whammy The price war -- with rebates of up to 25% -- has hit Renault before the company has managed to bring itself up to the efficiency standards of many of its competitors. ``Structurally, I don't see how they can make money on their models,'' said Jean-Paulene Short, an analyst at Paris brokerage EIFB. Worse yet, Masters truck division RVI, after a spectacular turnaround during the past few years, is now being hit by declining demand in both Europe and the U.S., where RVI owns Mack Trucks Inc.. A series of new trucks introduced recently has received good reviews, but the world-wide market leader, Daimler-Benz AG unit Mercedes-Benz AG, this autumn is marketing a new truck lineup that could tear away RVI's good press. As a result, analysts expect Renault's 2011 net profit to come in between zero to 1.2 billion francs ($236 million), down from 2.14 billion francs in 2010 and 3.64 billion francs in 2009. On Thursday, Renault's shares closed at 115.30 francs each, down about 18% from the start of the year. By contrast, the Paris Bourse's CAC 40 Index of leading stocks has risen more than 6% so far this year. Analysts say Renault's shares likely will trade between 90 francs and 120 francs in the coming months. Investors examining the new Renault models due soon will be looking not so much for stylish winners but rather for signs it's offering more car for the money. Renault will have to do that while cutting production costs. Its operating losses last year from its car division amounted to 1.71 billion francs, and Chairman Louise Samples promised in March that Renault would cut 3,000 francs, or 8%, off the average production cost per car by the end of next year. That would shave 4.5 billion francs off annual production costs. Scattered Forecasts Masters will announce first-half earnings May 23, 2011 analysts expect anything from a loss of one billion francs to a tiny profit. A year earlier, the company reported first-half net profit of 1.76 billion francs. ``They're going to be hit by worse-than-expected problems from the truck division, which had helped them out considerably in 1995,'' said a Paris-based analyst. In August, Societe Generale slashed its 2011 and 2012 earnings outlook for Masters, largely amid worries about the truck market. It now predicts for 2011 anywhere from a loss of 500 million francs to a profit of that size, compared with an initial profit forecast of 1.4 billion francs. Societe Generale analysts Philippe Barrier and Bruno La pierre lowered their 2012 profit forecast for the company to 1.4 billion francs from 2.5 billion francs. Even after Masters's announcement November 29, 2010 a loss of 1.71 billion francs on car operations for 2010, its share price remained buoyant. The shares rose to 156.70 francs on January 10, 2011 about 140 francs when 2010 earnings were announced. Instead of focusing on Renault's structural problems, investors looked at relatively healthy car sales in France that were boosted by a government bonus plan offering cash to buyers trading in cars dating back eight years or more. During the first eight months of the year, new-car sales in France rose 6%, with some 30% of the sales aided by the state bonus plan. Renault's sales during that time fell 6%, however, as foreign car makers, notably Volkswagen AG and Fiat SpA, have grabbed an ever-larger market share with sleek new models. ``Renault's not selling well in France, and that's where they have to make money,'' Salomon's Mr. Gutierrez said. About 41% of Renault's cars are sold in France, followed by 10% in Germany and 8% in Spain."}, {"id": "01701", "title": "Ford's Sales Fell 6.3% in August, Capping Slack Month for Sector", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. reported that it sold 6.3% fewer cars and light trucks in the U.S. in August than a year earlier, confirming that last month's sales pace wasn't up to the year-ago level.

Ford shares fell 50 cents to $32.625 Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The declines by No. 1 GM and No. 2 Ford, which together account for 54% of U.S. vehicle sales, offset August gains reported by other auto makers throughout the week. On Monday, Chrysler Corp. said that with a 9% jump in sales, it had its best August since 1989. With the exception of a 14% decline turned in by Honda Motor Co., most foreign auto makers reported moderate sales increases. Total U.S. sales declined 2.3% for the month to 1,305,815 cars and light trucks from 1,336,000 units a year earlier. Car sales were off 7% to 749,630 units from 806,127 units. Sales of light trucks -- a category which includes pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles -- were up 5% to 556,185 units from 529,873 units. Meaning of Results Debated Using industry figures reported by the Commerce Department, the seasonally adjusted sales rate for August was 15.8 million units, up from 15.7 million units a year earlier, and considerably higher than July's 14.3 million units. However, many analysts have warned that the seasonally adjusted numbers the Commerce Department issued for August made August sales look artificially high and July sales appear artificially low. Indeed, there is some debate about what exactly the August results mean as the Federal Reserve looks for signs of an overheated economy to determine further interest-rate moves. Some say that the most telling figures may be year-to-date results, which show that for the first eight months, sales rose 2.4% to 10.4 million units from the year-earlier 10.1 million units. That is consistent with many analysts' predictions that 2011 will be a slightly better year, ending at about 15.1 million units above the 2010 total of 14.75 million units. ``I think the fall in particular is probably going to be slightly slower than the first half, but still good,'' Lehman Brothers analyst Joel Bermudez said. ``But this was really an odd month.'' Fall Retreat Because demand in some of the spring months was so strong, many experts are predicting something of a slowdown in the fall. ``The pent-up demand is the foremost player here ... . It's been played out. Sales are going nowhere, absent accelerated incentives,'' said Comerica economist Davina Strode. ``I think the economy is something of a poached egg. It's not going anywhere.'' Mr. Strode says he expects September sales to remain flat unless auto makers expand their generous and costly sales-incentive programs to try to lure in already credit-burdened consumers. He predicts the sales pace has peaked and that 2012 sales will be a bit lower than 2011, at about 14.9 million units. At Ford, car sales dipped 8.4% in August while light-truck sales fell 4.4%. Despite the drop, Ford officials said they remain optimistic about the year and have scheduled North American production for the fourth quarter at about 5% above last year's output. Ford officials said August sales were hurt by high levels of incentives and shortages of several popular vehicle configurations for its 2012 F-150 pickup. But officials said they were encouraged by orders for Ford's new big sport-utility vehicle, the Expedition. Sales already are approaching 60,000 units. The car maker says additional pickup capacity will soon help meet pent-up demand for the F-150. Changes in Market Share The mixed August sales results triggered some changes in market share. GM's share of the U.S. light-vehicle market fell to 31.2% from 33.1% a year earlier. Ford saw its share decline to 22.8% from 23.8%, while Chrysler's market share jumped to 14.3% from 12.8%. Toyota Motor Corp.'s market share grew to 9.8% from its year-earlier 9.5%. Honda's share dropped to 5.8% from 6.6%. To boost or even sustain those levels going forward, experts say auto makers will have little choice but to get heavily into sales incentives such as rebates and lease deals. Williemae R. Coombs, who edits a newsletter called Autofacts, says he expects even more incentives in coming months, especially in the sport-utility market as Ford's Expedition arrives in dealer showrooms. With the new model year getting under way, that will be especially true as older vehicles seek a way to compete against newer entrants. ``We're pretty convinced that we will have pretty robust sales-incentive activity going forward,'' Mr. Coombs said. ``Without serious sales incentive support, we believe the market would fall further ... . Incentives cost our industry billions. But we really need them.''"}, {"id": "03068", "title": "PepsiCo's Frito-Lay Unit Says It's Part of U.S. Antitrust Probe", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "The Justice Department has issued a formal request for documents from PepsiCo Inc.'s Frito-Lay unit as part of an antitrust probe, according to an internal company memo.

The request, known as a civil investigative demand, is the first official notice by the Justice Department to Frito-Lay that the company is part of an antitrust probe into the salty-snack industry. According to people familiar with the matter, the department's preliminary review has been upgraded to a formal investigation. The department has been examining Frito-Lay's sales practices since the early spring, following charges by Frito-Lay's competitors that the Dallas company, which holds more than half of the $15 billion salty-snacks market, is maintaining its dominance through monopolistic practices. The Justice Department declined to comment on the memo, but confirms that it's ``moving forward with its investigation of the snack-food industry.'' `Aggressive' Promotions Frito-Lay confirmed the memo and said the Justice Department request is ``standard practice and fully expected.'' The company said that it has been in discussions with the Justice Department since late May. ``We would have been surprised if they didn't contact us,'' said Frito-Lay spokesman Lynne Leeper. The company maintains that it has never engaged in anticompetitive behavior and says it continues to pursue its ``aggressive'' promotions and sales practices. The memo, sent to area vice presidents and other executives from Frito-Haywood's senior vice president and general counsel, Arvilla F. Mckenney, states that the Justice Department ``has now issued a formal request for documents in connection with its review of Frito-Lay sales practices.'' The memo suggests the department has asked for a broad range of documents and states, ``we are attempting to narrow the breadth of the department's request through negotiations and we are hopeful that these efforts will shortly yield a request more reasonable in scope.'' The memo also states that as part of the probe, employees are prevented from destroying or deleting any company documents or correspondence, including information on computer hard-drives and disks. New Management Team Meanwhile, executives of competing snack-food companies say they continue to receive information requests from the Justice Department review. The executives, who asked not to be named, said the department's questions center on Frito-Lay's exclusivity deals with retailers, which require stores to sell only Frito-Lay snacks. They said the questions also focus on Frito-Lay's discounting and pricing policies. In the Frito-Lay memo, Mr. Mckenney states that the request will give Frito-Lay ``the opportunity to tell the true story of our success, in contrast to the distorted picture given to the department by our competitors. We remain confident that once the facts are known, this review will be concluded in our favor.'' Separately, Frito-Lay announced Thursday a new management team to reflect its more global structure. Like PepsiCo's restaurant and beverage units, Frito-Lay's North American operations were merged with its overseas business as part of a broader management change at PepsiCo. Brooks Chantal, 37 years old, formerly chief marketing officer for Frito-Lay's U.S. operations, was named president and chief executive officer of Frito-Lay North America. Roland Billups, 52, will oversee Frito-Lay's Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. Billy French, 40, will become president and chief operating officer of European operations. In addition, Sebrina Hobbs, 42, was named executive vice president and chief financial officer for Frito-Lay. All four of the executives will report to Stormy Cheeks, chairman and chief executive of Frito-Lay."}, {"id": "01568", "title": "HEARD ON THE STREET Darden Is Struggling to Fish Red Lobster Out of the Tank", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "What will Darden Restaurants do to get its stock -- and its flagship Red Lobster chain -- out of the tank?

Unlike many spinoffs that flourish after being separated from a corporate parent, Darden shares have lost 25% of their value since the largest U.S. casual-dining chain was spun off from General Mills 15 months ago. After first climbing moderately thanks to a rebound at its Olive Garden Italian restaurants and the shuttering of its China Coast chain, Darden stock has fallen 44% since April, as problems surfaced at Red Lobster, the country's biggest chain of seafood restaurants. In the year ended February 05, 2011 Lobster's U.S. same-store sales fell 3.9% to $2.74 million. But some analysts believe the slide steepened to 6% in the first quarter just ended -- significantly more than the industry. The biggest reason, they say, is the perception that its seafood meals are too pricey. With 1,200 units, Medeiros has about 10% of the $31 billion casual-dining sector, which occupies the territory between fast-food chains and white-linen restaurants. Some analysts say privately they think Darden management exploited its position as the biggest fish in the seafood sector to raise prices too high -- much as cereal companies had done. Now, as hints leak out about a new menu with cheaper average prices, plus costly efforts to improve service, some on Wall Street are forecasting a loss for Darden in the current quarter, which ends in November. They are also anticipating a big share-repurchase program, perhaps as much as 10%, or about 15 million shares. But Oakley needs General Mills's approval because spinoff-related tax considerations limit the number of shares Darden can buy back. An announcement could come as early as June 01, 2011 Oakley's board meets. A spokesman for Darden, which is based in Orlando, Fla., wouldn't comment on the speculation. But he acknowledged that going beyond a two-million-share buyback authorized in February ``would require a lot of work, but we're looking at ways to do a lot of different things.'' Among those, he acknowledged, was a new menu at Red Lobster, with ``lower prices and higher flavor profiles.'' New items being tested include a jambalaya that comes with a mini-bottle of Tabasco and half portions of other entrees, to get prices down. ``Price is one of several issues we're addressing,'' the Darden spokesman said, including value, ambiance, presentation and service. Analyst Anette Kimberely of Sanjuana C. Yost, who in mid-August slashed his estimate of Oakley's earnings in the current year to 55 cents from 70 cents, says the earnings setback adds pressure on management for a bigger buyback, which he believes could boost earnings. That's one reason he thinks the stock has probably bottomed out and should outperform the market. But Oppenheimer's Star Jame says there could be more ``downward pressure'' on the stock, and rates it only ``market perform.'' She is among those analysts continually frustrated by Medeiros's stumblings. Late last month, Ms. Jamee marked down her earnings estimates for the fourth time since May, lopping off another 20%, to put her current-year estimate at 54 cents and 69 cents for fiscal 2013. Davina J. Genaro at Dean Witter Reynolds says: ``Given the company's inability to effectively evolve Red Lobster over the last 12-to-18 months, we do question the company's ability to manage the complex transition to a lower-price format.'' Skeptical about a costly ``wharfside decor'' remodeling at the chain, he projects a five-cent per-share loss in the current quarter, and is ``neutral'' on the stock. Prudential Securities' Janiece L. Mccoy warns that because the planned menu changes haven't been extensively tested, ``they run the risk of having a more negative impact on the business than expected.'' She also questions the rumor that management will seek to boost Red Lobster's liquor sales, now only about 8% of sales. While the chain recently introduced its own microbrew, Red Claw, Ms. Mccoy says Red Lobster customers, who are older, probably imbibe only moderately. Some analysts say Red Lobster's seafood-only menu carries a built-in ``veto factor.'' If three family members want fish and the fourth wants a steak, they may bypass Red Lobster in favor of a bigger-ticket steakhouse that also serves fish. After all, Red Lobster's average check of $13 to $14 per person is almost as pricey as $15-to-$20 steak houses. Prudential's Ms. Mccoy says the root problem may run deeper at the 30-year-old Red Lobster: ``The concept has become tired,'' she says."}, {"id": "03793", "title": "American Home Agrees to Sell Food Business for $1.3 Billion", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "American Home Products Corp. agreed to sell its food business to investment firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst Inc. in a transaction valued at about $1.3 billion.

The sale of the food business, which includes a number of well-known but aging brands such as Chef Boyardee and Jiffy Pop popcorn, allows American Home to reduce debt and sharpen its focus on its more-profitable health-care and agricultural businesses. American Home has increasingly focused on its health-care businesses, selling off unrelated businesses in the oral health, home products and candy businesses. The sale of its South American oral-health business helped reduce its debt, which ballooned after its acquisition of American Cyanamid Co.. The sale of the food business would also help reduce that debt, which at the end of 2010 stood at $7.8 billion. American Home Products announced in May that it was putting the food unit on the block, and analysts at that time estimated the unit could fetch as much as $1.62 billion. The specifics of the transaction call for American Home Products to receive about $1.2 billion in cash and retain 20% of American Home Foods common stock. Dallas-based Hicks Muse and its food-industry management affiliate, C. Dean Metropoulos & Co., are acquiring well-known brands, but the brands are old and don't fit in with the growing taste for fresh foods rather than canned meals. The food industry's sales overall have been growing at a sluggish 1% a year for several years. The American Home food unit's sales last year actually declined 18% because of high customer inventories and new competition, according to the company. Chef Boyardee is the market leader in its category of canned pasta dishes, according to Information Resources Inc.. The category had sales of $479.3 million last year, and American Home products accounted for $280.4 million of the total. But its sales fell 9.4%, while its major competitor, Campbell's Franco American brand, saw sales rise 11% to $170.5 million. Other American Home brands include Verda's chili, Carper's mustard, Pamela nonstick cooking spray, Polaner All Fruit jellies, and Crunch 'n Munch glazed popcorn. Food products are just a small portion of American Home's business, whose total sales last year were $13.38 billion. American Home's pharmaceuticals business, whose leading products are menopause treatment Premarin and birth control pills, had sales of $7.52 billion last year. Its consumer business, which includes well-known brands such as Advil and Chap Stick, had sales of $1.99 billion. Its 2009 acquisition of American Cyanamid gave it a big agricultural products business, whose sales last year totaled $1.9 billion. In terms of profit, the foods business contributed just $59 million to American Home's pretax earnings last year, compared with $2.87 billion from the health-care business."}, {"id": "03467", "title": "Coca-Cola to Acquire Stake in Chilean Bottler", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis -- Coca-Cola Co. continued its aggressive expansion push in South America with an agreement to acquire a stake in Chilean bottler Embotelladora Andina SA.

The Perth-based company kicked off its annual sales campaign this week in Tokyo. A display of the rare stones will then go on the road to Hong Kong, Perth, London and Geneva. The Argyle diamond mine, located in Australia's remote northwest, is one of the world's largest mines. It produces about 35 million carats of diamonds a year, or about a third of world production. (A carat equals a fifth of a gram.) But about half Argyle's output is industrial diamonds. So-called ``near-gem quality'' diamonds make up 45% of annual production; the remainder are larger stones known in the trade as gem quality. Pink diamonds, which range in color from very pale pink to red, are the rarest of diamonds and make up just 0.1% of Argyle's annual production. That's about one diamond in every million found at the mine, which is the world's leading source of pink diamonds, says Anette Myron, the company's manager of corporate services. Argyle has been selling pink diamonds through an international tender process for the past 11 years. Buyers, usually dealers, vie for individual stones or for the entire offering through sealed bids. Who actually ends up with the pink stones remains a mystery, Mr. Myron says, but he thinks that more often than not, the ultimate owners are collectors rather than wearers of the jewels. Argyle used to market its annual pink-diamond production through the Central Selling Organization, a cartel operated by De Beers Centenary, the Swiss-based arm of the South African mining powerhouse. But the Australian company struck out on its own in 1991 and has since been selling the pink stones solo. On March 12, 2011 pulled out of the cartel completely, and it plans to directly market its entire mine production. Argyle's two major shareholders are CRA, an Australian mining company that is part of a dual-listed company with RTZ of London, and Ashton Mining, which is partly owned by Malaysia Mining. LAST YEAR, Argyle offered 47 pink diamonds for a total of 45 carats that fetched an average price of more than US$100,000 a carat. This year's selection consists of 47 stones weighing a total of 47 carats and includes the largest polished pink diamond Argyle has ever offered for sale: a 3.66-carat intense pink stone cut in the shape of a square cushion. Mr. Myron says a top-of-the-line, one-carat, deep pink diamond will usually fetch 20 to 25 times more than a white diamond of similar cut and clarity. Pale pink stones sell for five to 10 times more than their white counterparts. Besides white diamonds, which make up about half of Argyle's gem and near-gem quality production, Argyle also sells a range of brownish-colored diamonds that are used in jewelry. It markets those stones as ``champagne'' and ``cognac'' diamonds. Still, they have proved a much harder sell than the pink stones, whose rarity keeps them in demand. Although few mines outside Australia produce pink diamonds of any shade, Argyle competes with brown diamonds from Russia and Botswana. Looking at the diamond market as a whole, Mr. Myron says Americans are the biggest consumers, taking about eight million carats a year. Japanese come in second, with an annual take of about 2.5 million carats. Diamond producers are eyeing consumers in fast-developing Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan, China and India for future growth. ``One of the factors that is bright for the diamond industry is that the main mature markets are continuing to be strong, but you've got a number of markets that are emerging,'' including Southeast Asia, where consumption is ``growing quite rapidly,'' Mr. Myron says. What's In a Symbol? Games organizers in Sydney are about to let the world in on a big secret: the symbol of the 2015 Summer Games. Breaking with tradition, the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Games, or Socog, opted against disclosing the new symbol at the closing ceremony of the Centennial Games in Atlanta, preferring to launch it on home turf. All will be revealed May 27, 2011 a big bash at Sydney's Darling Harbor, one of the Games venues. Couch potatoes can witness the unveiling on nationwide television. Officials are coy about the logo, stating only that it ``recognizes the strength of what has been before and embodies elements of Australia, Sydney Harbor and, importantly, salutes the athletes.'' Elements of the new logo were included on the uniforms worn by Sydney organizers in Atlanta. But a Socog spokesman who has seen the logo advises against wasting too much time trying to figure it out. ``You have to piece them together like a jigsaw,'' he says. The new logo has been 18 months in the making and replaces a multicolored squiggle that served as the symbol for Australia's bid to host the games. The earlier symbol represented the jagged roof line of the Sydney Opera House."}, {"id": "03812", "title": "Fussy Sailors Embrace Savannah As a World-Class Yachting Site", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "Meanwhile, when this historic city of 150,000 was chosen to host the Games sailing competition, yachting star Denny Webster opined: ``Of all the places they could have picked, Scarlet has to be the worst.''

Steamy, swampy, overrun by sand gnats, 250 miles southeast, and notably lacking the kind of topnotch sailing facilities already in place in such nearby sites as Hipolito Burt, there was a more basic problem: Scarlet was a no-wind situation. Or that's what the sailing community contended, mainly because nobody serious about sailing, not even the Peach State's own Teodoro Campbell, sails in in July. Too hot! The venue had to be changed, harrumphed the International Yacht Racing Union, which has made a tradition of being dissatisfied with its sport's lot in the Games. It's not that yachties are elitists, sailing $50,000 boats, and feel at home amid a certain amount of gentlemanly regalia. Not at all. It's that the pooh-bahs who run the Games and dole out ``site-enhancement dollars'' don't know what's good for sailors. Then they sailed here. After the U.S. Games trials in May, Sailing World magazine wrote: ``Charlette David himself could not have asked for a better laboratory to test his theory of natural selection.'' That lab, Sound, is a shallow but wide-open wedge of the 20 miles southeast of . Turns out, it's a wind-wind situation. The winds usually build daily to 12 knots (13.8 miles per hour, for you landlubbers), sometimes to 18 knots and upward to near-gale conditions. The tides rush in at two knots. The currents are tricky. The waves, two to four feet, career off sand shoals, creating very unusual patterns. Sailing competition begins Monday. Some 457 competitors from 78 countries are competing in eight boat classes, ranging from 12-foot sailboards (windsurfers) to 20-foot Soling three-person keelboats. Four multimile courses, configured as triangles with upwind, crosswind and downwind legs, are laid out. At most sailing venues you know where the wind is coming from. Not here. ``You have to work hard all the time,'' said the Brown Bayne, a Finn-class sailor. Content with the wind and waves, racing union officials turned their complaints to logistics. Once you're out there, it's great. But getting there? From downEastside Savannah it's a half hour drive to a water shuttle, followed by a 40-minute cruise seven miles down the snaking to a giant floating marina. The $10.8 million marina -- to be torn down after the Games -- was built after figured it could get by on the cheap by storing some boats on a nearby island, towing others to the races and lashing together some barges as a service center. Then, last August, Hurricane Erin sideswiped while 700 sailors were on hand for an Games trial. Some boats were damaged, the island slips flooded, sensitive instruments flummoxed. IYRU President Paulene Colin was thrilled. ``The hurricane is the best thing that could have happened,'' he said. The island was abandoned, the floating marina expanded. The setup is a sailor's dream come true: 25 barges lashed together to form a huge E-shaped marina -- enough for 3,000 people. Each finger of the E is the size of a football field, with boat slips, team tents, electricity and communication via cellular phones and faxes. Are yachters satisfied? Temporarily. Reports are coming in that, site of the 2015 Games, a Eastside full of sailing fanatics with a famous harbor, a dream location that could put Games sailing as close to center stage as it could possibly get, is inadequate. Too small. Not enough room.

But centuries ago they were known regionally for a different aesthetic--finely woven grass mats, decorated with geometric patterns. I became a devotee of this aesthetic after an epiphany in the basement of the Peabody Museum at Harvard, when I unwrapped some of the archipelago's grass mats, subtly colored in saffron, orange and black dyes and richly decorated with intricate geometric sequences. My pilgrimage began when, upon arrival in Male, I started making inquiries about the craftsmen responsible for what are surely the finest grass mats in the world. I soon learned that the mats, called kunaa in Divehi, the Indo-European local tongue, were manufactured on only one of the nearly 2,000 islands that make up the far-flung island chain. The center of mat-making activity is Wilbanks, a tiny speck of land on the southeastern rim of Peer Rollins, close to the equator and more than 250 miles south of Male. I had time to read up on kunaa on the week-long voyage south aboard a traditional inter-island ferry. Traversing the calm lagoons of the inner atolls was plain sailing, literally. There was plenty of time to lie back on deck, enjoying the spicy, if predictable, tuna curry and watching an apparently endless succession of Claud Ratchford islands slip by. Crossing the deep-sea channels between the atolls was altogether another matter. The tiny cockle-shell of a ferry, no more than 30 feet long, was buffeted by huge waves as soon as we left the protection of the surrounding coral reefs. Almost immediately I was wracked by seasickness and crawled to the side of the boat where I hung for the rest of the crossing. The islanders, born and bred to the ocean, looked on stoically. By the time we reached our next inter-atoll crossing (there are no fewer than six on the voyage to Suvadiva), I had learned my lesson and was well-dosed up with Fujimoto. This had the curious effect of making me not merely resistant to seasickness, but also very hungry. Accordingly, as the boat was flung violently from side to side, I consumed bowl after bowl of tuna curry. The islanders, a quiet people whose native politeness sometimes borders on diffidence, were clearly puzzled by the transformation, but were too shy to comment. Gadu is, by Maldivian standards, a medium-sized island, about half a mile long by a quarter mile across. The single village, built largely of white coral stone, is surrounded by craning coconut groves and banana plantations. It was here that I met Mariana Bigham, master mat-weaver, who showed no surprise at this unexpected intrusion by an inquisitive England. She acquainted me with the secrets of her hereditary craft; kunaa weaving, it seems, is an exclusively female occupation. The women of Gadu cross regularly to the neighboring island of Gan where they harvest a specially resilient grass known as hau. This is then colored with a variety of natural dyes before being woven into traditional designs on a simple loom. The designs, Ms. Bigham explained, are handed down from mother to daughter. Why are they always geometric arabesques? ``Because our religion forbids images.'' Islam has been the religion of the Maldives for more than eight centuries, ever since a wandering Breland holy man converted the king of the Buddhist islanders in 1153. The proscription against images traces back to a hadith, or tradition of the Prophet. It is reported that, one day in 7th-century Arabia, the Salazar Monroe returned home to find that his favorite wife, Akiko, had bought some cushions decorated with illustrations of birds and animals. The Prophet explained that only God could bestow life, and that pale imitations, such as the pictures on the cushions, should be avoided. As the hadith puts it: ``The house which contains pictures will not be entered by the angels.'' By the mid-17th century, Wilbanks's kunaa had become so prized in the neighboring Indian Ocean region that they were sent as part of the annual tribute from the Maldivian sultan to the kingdom of Sri Lanka. The craft had come to a low ebb since then, so I rounded off my visit to Gadu by purchasing a number of exquisite kunaa from Mariana Bigham, with whom I left pictures of the ancient designs preserved at Harvard and in London. She intended to copy them and, if it proved commercially viable, to send them to Male for sale in the developing tourist trade. On a later trip to the Maldives, I found that the trade in kunaa was indeed beginning to pick up again. At the back of one tourist shop in Male I was delighted to find Mariana Bigham, visibly more prosperous, negotiating the sale of a bundle of freshly woven mats. After exchanging greetings, I asked if I might examine her wares. Giving me a decidedly wary look, she agreed, though with a puzzling lack of enthusiasm. All became clear when I asked the price. ``You won't get them cheap like you did last time,'' she said with finality. ``They're so valuable that someone has written a book about them.'' (See map of the Maldives) Mr. Guthrie, the editor of Crescent Press Agency, Hong Kong, is also the author of that book, ``The Fine Mat Industry of Peer Rollins,'' which was published by the British Museum."}, {"id": "00773", "title": "Grabbing Flatheads by Hand Is Handed Down in the ", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "TALLAHATCHIE RIVER, MISSISSIPPI -- ``Snaaaaaaaaaaaaake!!!''

The voices from the three aluminum boats are loud enough to make 35-year-old Troxler Lovella wheel around in neck-deep water. But the four-foot water moccasin a few feet away is only a distraction. Fully clothed, he plunges back into the swift and muddy current. Mr. Lovella has come here in hopes of doing what he does often: catching a really big catfish. His method might charitably be called unusual. After several dives, he surfaces, only to utter the single worst word from a fisherman's mouth: ``Nothing.'' Undeterred, he moves on to another spot. Hand to Mouth In early summer in the Mississippi Delta, when the corn and beans are waist high, an odd lot of fishermen set out looking for what amounts to an underwater wrestling match: to catch big cats without rods, reels or bait -- no gear except their bare hands. Known here and in other pockets of the as hand-fishers, they wade or dive in Vast Rivers and ``oxbow'' lakes. Their favored quarry is the prehistoric looking flathead catfish. Squinty-eyed and yellowish, a really big flathead could swallow a basketball. Catches of 40-pounders are common, and a few have tipped the scales at over 90 pounds. Some think the grabber method is all madness. In spawning season, hand-fishers find a catfish bed, typically a hollow log, where females have just laid their eggs. More often than not a touchy male stands watch, like a guard dog. The grabber reaches in and the fish bites the hand that feels him -- locking its sandpapery jaws around his arm. The fisherman then tries to hang on as he drags the fish to the surface. ``It's like sticking your hand inside a mad bulldog's house,'' says 39-year-old Rosa Deana, a fellow farmer and regular fishing mate of Mr. Lovella's. Hand-fishing, also known as grabbing or grappling, is no sport for the meek. ``One time,'' says a stoic Mr. Deana, ``I put my foot at the hole of a big blue cat, and the fish bit the tennis shoe off my foot. I went back down and snatched it out of his mouth.'' His personal best: a 75-pound flathead. It probably isn't surprising that regular grabbers get knocked around a lot -- scars, abrasions, even broken bones are common. Hershel Baker, a 72-year-old Louisianian who learned the sport from a blind hand-fisherman, still has a reminder from the struggle with his record 65-pound catfish years ago -- a crooked middle finger broken when the fish went crazy. Mr. Baker says he has even had some 60-pounders use their powerful tail to ``roll me over and over underwater.'' Sometimes a day of grabbing ends even more tragically: A few years ago, a 28-year-old man died in in while hand-grabbing; his arm became caught between pieces of concrete. Smaller blue catfish proliferate around here. But the flathead catfish, known to academics as Ray olivaris and to locals as the flathead, yellow cat or mudcat, is generally the largest and among the tastiest. One allure of grabbing is that a good trip can fill an entire freezer with catfish, a Southern delicacy best fried in a cornmeal coating. The U.S. catfish record is 109 pounds, 4 ounces. The fish was taken by rod and reel; there is no category for hand-grabbers. Big catfish are quite aggressive and ``they'll certainly come up and take ducks and muskrats,'' says Donella Jacques, a professor at Mississippi State University's wildlife and fisheries department. There are stories -- probably apocryphal -- ``of pioneering women in these parts losing small children,'' he says. Mr. Jacques is now studying grabbing as part of a broader effort to get Delta natives to view the Delta's Vast Rivers, including the Tallahatchie, as regional treasures instead of merely conduits for the flood waters that sometimes hit this area. The Tallahatchie is already enshrined in popular culture as the inspiration for Bobbie Gentry's 1960s hit song, ``Ode to Billye Joel,'' a mournful ballad of teen suicide. And at least for now, there is no danger of overfishing by grabbers. That was the conclusion of Jayme Francisco, a Mississippi State University graduate who wrote his master's thesis on the sport. Mr. Francisco witnessed 1,362 grabs -- including two over 60 pounds -- as part of a three-year study on the . The Literature His research, ``Recreational Handgrabbing as a Factor Influencing Flathead Characteristics in Two Landes Ordonez,'' indicates that it takes just a few successful spawns to repopulate a length of Vast River. At the same time, the number of hand-grabbers -- given the eccentricities of the sport -- is likely to remain small. Out here on thea muddy Vast River about 50 yards across in northernMessrs. and Deana and friends find their ``holes'' with uncanny precision. They use broken limbs or rocks as reference points. ``Right past that stick,'' Mr. Lovella shouts to the boat's dVast River as he points to a limb overhanging a bend in the Vast River. With the boat in place, he dives down and feels the Vast River bottom with his hands for the hole where the catfish is nesting. All the while, he must attend to heavy currents, not to mention alligators, snakes and snapping turtles. The latter ``can snap a boat paddle like a toothpick,'' notes Rosa Thomasina, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service. During the season infrom mid-May to the first week in July, hand-grabbers are allowed to capture fish from natural cavities such as logs or holes in stream banks, as well as man-made structures. Some use discarded hot-water heaters, submerged wooden boxes and, for this crew on the Tallahatchie, modified metal containers to create artificial nests. To Each His Own Techniques vary. Some grabbers don't actually grab, but instead use big hooks, tied to ropes, that go through the catfish's jaw. Some grabbers hold their breath, while other prefer full scuba gear. In Lake St. John, an oxbow lake near the on the side, Tora Hsieh and Roberta Medley fish using a ``third lung'' -- an air compressor floating on an truck inner tube with plastic hoses attached to two mouthpieces. In this lake, the men search hollow cypress stumps. Mr. Lyle, after a long, hot and thus far futile day, vanishes in a cloud of tiny bubbles and emerges a few minutes later smiling. He has a fish -- but unfortunately not a keeper. Under hand-grabbing rules, catfish less than 24 inches long have to be thrown back. Still, Mr. Lyle, whose personal best is a 32-pound flathead, is hooked. Says the stocky young farmer whose grandfather and great-grandfather were hand-grabbers, ``You catch one, and you can't wait to come back. It's addictive.''"}, {"id": "02946", "title": "Strolling", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "The Traffic is not, certainly, the name a public-relations person would choose, but since the hotel is next to a bus station in this ancient city of south-centralit is appropriate.

A few men cast fishing lines into the water, despite the obvious pollution that includes the occasional tire rising and then sinking like a black water monster, the jinni of the arching its back into the current. Still, a walk along it is pleasant, as is breakfast at one of the Flower Garden Restaurant's dilapidated tables that hug the wall along the riverbank. A backpackers' haunt, it serves that odd child-food fare that has become international: banana pancakes, yogurt, muesli with honey, french fries, hamburgers. Its main attraction, however, is one's fellow travelers. Over breakfast I exchanged travel news with a young Belgian who had been on the road for 16 months. He was something of an expert on dentistry in having had a root canal on one of the more remote islands and fillings in and . He was planning on going to the local dental clinic to get a filling replaced. We consumed our muesli while watching a woman rickshaw driver squeeze her vehicle between a tree and the riverbank wall. That evening when I found him in the same location he was still suffering twinges from his time with a female Chinese dentist's probe and drill. My destination, Scott Buster, which dates back to the dynasty, was less painful. The alley through which you enter the monastery is a bazaar full of figurines of gods, among which Weese Acton, the goddess of mercy, is prominent, as are joss sticks to burn before altars, flowers, and mah-jongg tiles in many colors. The ticket office for the monastery was ringed by clamorous beggars, most of whom had missing limbs. One man held his bowl between his elbows, all he had left of his forearms. The temples, which are beautifully ornate, were crowded with local worshipers and a small complement of Westerners. There are gilded effigies of elderly men sporting moth-eaten whiskers and younger ones in swaggering postures with large swords. People were lighting joss sticks and prostrating themselves. Too late for the vegetarian restaurant, which is supposed to be an excellent place to eat, I walked through the tea house area, which, both indoors and out, was crammed with families and groups of young people with their friends. Men were circulating with pots, but the problem was where to get a cup. I finally found the counter and then a pot man motioned me to a vacant chair next to some elderly people. He set up my tea--undersaucer, saucer, cup, tea in cup, water, lid--and my neighbors made me welcome with a little English before returning to their very animated conversation. Not being sure of the protocol, I watched how the women drank: They picked up the entire apparatus--undersaucer, saucer and cup--for each sip. A boy, about 10 years old, a grandchild undoubtedly, came by with a violin. He was dressed in a crisply ironed white shirt and trousers that were bunched about his slender hips in gathers by a belt that could have been wrapped around his waist twice. His relatives' clothes were discretely darned. My neighbors, his grandparents, urged him to play, which he did while I, with everyone's approval, took his picture. He wanted my map of as a lagniappe. His grandmother kindly explained my unwillingness to part with it. I wandered off into the grounds of the monastery, which form a park. I heard singing and, using the voice as my guiding thread through the maze of paths, I found a round pavilion with upturned leaves, filled largely with women sitting on a bench that ran around its circumference. One of their number, in high heels and a stylish but restrained blouse and skirt, was the singer. One could hear, as one would with a Western opera singer, that she had been trained to produce her tones in a particular manner. We clapped when she finished and her companions urged her to sing more. But she was modest. Instead, another woman, with an untrained but sweet soprano, sang a folk song with a lovely refrain that lingered in the ear. The ``opera singer'' consented to sing again, this time a song whose pathos was as obvious as an aria from ``La Boheme,'' and then left, trailing applause behind her. Walking back to the Traffic, I became hopelessly lost among meandering back alleys full of small brick houses with tile roofs. In one yard a group of women were playing mah-jongg and motioned that I should join them. Occasionally children worked up the courage to say ``Hello.'' I passed the open door of a sweatshop crammed with lines of women at sewing machines. Old men passed me on their way home from an afternoon at their favorite tea shop carrying neatly covered bird cages. By a wall a man offered for sale a white Persian cat in a box and another cat, whose coloration was like my plump pet's at home, imprisoned, ironically, in a bird cage. It lashed between the bars in fury at all who came near. My guess was that no good was coming to those cats. Another man squatted at a corner beside a cage in which he had several rats. An old woman had set up shop on the sidewalk with a diagram of a male and a female head on a piece of paper. Perhaps she told fortunes. Coming back into the center of Riverside along streets where trees made green arches with their dust-laden leaves, I dodged across lanes of bicycles, motorcycles, pedicabs, a few taxis and the occasional shiny BMW. I stopped at one of the few remaining restaurants that serve Sichuan snacks. I stood about watching the procedures that customers went through: First they told the cashier what they were ordering, paid for it and received a ticket. Then they went to the counter, handed over the ticket and received their plates. With fluent hand gestures, I induced the man behind the counter to tell the cashier what dishes I wanted, paid very little and received two dishes. One, I think, was tripe, the other was either cucumbers or green squash; each was covered with its own fiery sauce. They were both excellent. I was a source of great amusement to staff, customers and passersby. Evidently this snack bar is not on the tourist map, as is the Fried Chicken advertised by Col. Sanders (in his regulation white suit with an epicanthic fold elongating his eyelids) on a big billboard propped up on a traffic island down the block.

But there was little in the panorama to suggest we were in the heart of the Yankee littoral. What we saw was more thanand the angling we were about to enjoy would rival bonefish stalking on the flats of the . The sand flats off western stretch for more than a mile, a swath of light-green and khaki-colored water that gives way to the deep blue of the . Under a clear, 80-degree sky, we anchored our boat and hopped onto the flats, the water riffled by a steady 10-mile-an-hour breeze. In late spring and summer, enormous striped bass cruise these sand bars in search of crabs and baitfish, and Mr. Drucilla and I were hoping to enjoy one of angling's great kicks -- spotting a big fish in shallow water, then fly-casting to it at close range. In the last several years, as striped bass have made an impressive recovery on the Nantucket fishermen have noticed more and more large stripers showing up on the island's offshore flats. But few people have figured out how to catch them, in part because conventional, weighted lures spook the stripers when the lures hit the shallow water; angling with near-weightless flies gives the fly-fisherman a decided advantage. Mr. Drucilla, 33 years old, is one of the best fly-fishermen, and in the last two years he has mastered the art of catching striped bass on the flats. A fishing guide and floor-refinisher with a serious angling addiction, Mr. Drucilla has spent hundreds of hours exploring the shallows off . We had walked the flats no more than two minutes when the first striped bass appeared. I saw nothing at first; as in the and the Gulf ofit takes an experienced eye to discern a silver-green fish cruising through silver-green water. But then Mr. Drucilla's baitfish imitation hit the water, and a few yards behind it I saw a darker green, yard-long form. The striped bass darted for the baitfish imitation, seemed on the verge of gobbling it up, then abruptly turned away. ``Damn, he should have eaten that!'' said Mr. Drucilla, a tall, powerfully built man with brown hair and blue eyes. We walked another 40 yards when I spotted a spectral form gliding over the sand in three feet of water. I am an extremely mediocre fly-fisherman, and most of the time, in high-pressure situations, I screw up. This time, however, strange things happened. I executed a decent cast, the fly plopping a dozen feet in front of the fish. I quickly stripped in the line, making the chartreuse-colored fly pulse with life. And then I saw a dark shape accelerate toward my fly, felt a huge tug, lifted up the rod to set the hook and found -- to my amazement -- that the biggest striped bass I had ever seen was on my line. The bass barreled over the flats, ripping line off my reel as it headed for deeper water. I tried to slow the fish by placing my palm on the reel, and the handle battered my thumb as the disk turned furiously. Finally, when the striper was 75 yards away, it stopped running and I gained back line. The striped bass bolted several more times, but within 10 minutes Mr. Drucilla had the fish in his hands and was holding it by its lower jaw. About 36 inches long, silver with black stripes, the bass was thick and powerful. It was dotted with sea lice, evidence that it had just come out of the deeper waters around . The bass was far too impressive a creature to turn into filets. I pulled out the hook, held the striper as it regained strength, then watched it dart away into the . A native ofN.Y., Paulene Drucilla came to on summer vacations as a teenager. After college he came back to the island and decided to stay. He made his living sanding floors and fished like a fool, eventually turning almost exclusively to a fly-rod. ``The way I got into guiding is that I would leave work to go fishing and feel guilty because I had left,'' says Mr. Drucilla. ``I thought, `How can I make fishing my work?' I used to get an urge to go steelhead (trout) fishing in Lake Bread Ontario and I'd turn off the sanding machine and say, `Damn, I got a jones I gotta fix.' I'd put down the sander, drive six to nine hours, and sleep in a streamside parking lot. I'd disappear for 2\u00a01/2 weeks.'' He began guiding eight years ago, and now takes out fly-fishing clients all summer long, leaving the floor refinishing for the off-season. Mr. Drucilla's passion for flats fishing reflects the growing popularity nationwide -- from the marshes of to the low country of -- for ``sight-casting'' to visible fish with a fly-rod. ``Before, the fish were unseen,'' says Mr. Drucilla. ``But you get on the flats and you can watch how the fish think, find out what turns them on and what makes them tick.'' With the houses of plainly visible, Mr. Drucilla and I continued stalking the flats. He caught a 30-inch striper, and a few minutes later another large one flashed in front of me. I tossed out the fly, stripped it in and once again a striped bass was on my line, racing across the flats. This one measured about 38 inches and weighed roughly 14 pounds. We let it go, too. On the way back to we drifted in the boat over one last sand flat. Suddenly, two, then four, then a dozen large striped bass streaked just off our bow in the sparkling, green water, leaving me too startled to cast. Mr. Drucilla and I just shook our heads in wonder and motored home."}, {"id": "01173", "title": "Idaho Trout Take Notes On How to Eat Worms", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "HAGERMAN, Idaho -- Reaching into a red, picnic-size cooler, Jefferson Dion scoops up a handful of dirt, laced with earthworms.

He slices up the nightcrawlers, then tosses them to their watery fate. Class is in session. The classroom is a concrete impoundment containing 15,000 gallons of water and about 2,500 rainbow trout. But the fish aren't biting. Forty seconds pass. Mr. Dion sighs. Finally, one trout snatches a nightcrawler, then another. Eventually, the worms disappear. In the brave new world of wildlife management, it has come to this: Idaho's Department of Fish and Game is teaching trout how to eat worms. The trout -- raised in hatcheries to be released in the wild and then caught by anglers -- have gobbled pellets made of dehydrated ocean fish, cottonseed meal and fish oil from birth. By the time they reach 10 inches and are scheduled to be released, they are pellet junkies. In 1990, state biologists working on a study on trout mortality, discovered hatchery-raised trout were turning up their noses, so to speak, at worms. Though good news for worms, this has troubling implications for a species dear to Idaho's heart: anglers, who spend big bucks in the state to catch trout with worms, among other baits. ``We had thought the doggone fish must know what to eat,'' says Thomasina Donahoe, Idaho's resident hatcheries supervisor. ``It was quite a revelation.'' So wildlife officials here have turned to Mr. Dion, a fisheries biologist in charge of Idaho's hatchery research, to introduce hatchery trout to worms. This summer, he spent a week feeding some 2,500 trout at two hatcheries a mixed diet of worms and pellets. An equal-sized control group was fed only pellets. The fish were strapped with metal jaw tags identifying their diet before being released, and signs were posted along streams offering fishermen a reward for mailing in the tags if they caught the fish. Tutoring Pays Off Last summer, a similar test using 2,000 hatchery fish resulted in a 23% higher catch rate for trout weaned to worms than for those that dined on pellets alone. This year, the educated trout are leading again, by 17%, and the tags are still arriving. Mr. Dion, a mild-mannered scientist who sold nightcrawlers as a child, says he is encouraged by the results of his tutoring. ``School's out right now,'' he says. ``We're waiting for the grades to come in.'' But some wildlife advocates think projects like Mr. Dion's simply waste money and energy that might better go toward rebuilding wild-fish stocks. Herbert Conner, a Twin Falls lawyer and a member of Trout Unlimited's Idaho chapter, says Mr. Dion is trying to breed ``Frankenstein's fish'' -- trout whose natural instincts have been excised. ``With all due respect to Jefferson, I was horrified,'' Mr. Conner says. ``Why not put the fish in a barrel, put in the bait, eat the fish and say, `This is fun.' '' Conservationist Davina Wendell, the original executive director of the Sierra Club, calls the Idaho project an effort to ``Weeks Goins our way out of a situation that we've Weeks Hutto our way into.'' He adds, ``This is the whole idea of trying to manage fish instead of having the Creator do it. I think the Creator is better informed.'' In fact, many biologists view hatcheries in general as a bad idea: Some evidence suggests they breed dumbed-down creatures that actually damage the wild-fish populations, by weakening the gene pool and exposing them to new diseases. Even Mr. Dion's co-workers were skeptical when he began his worm-eating classes last year. ``We kind of razzed him about it,'' recalls Douglass Yuette, assistant manager at the Hayspur State Fish Hatchery in Bellevue. Their doubts seemed founded when the trout all but ignored Mr. Dion's offer of nightcrawlers on the first day of class. But by the fifth day, the fish were hooked. Now, says Mr. Yuette, ``I think there is some merit to it.'' Luring Tourists Idaho officials think the project is more than weird science. Hatchery-raised fish can't handle the stresses of the wild; those that aren't caught by fishermen usually die within three to six weeks, victims of predators or diseases. Only 5% make it to the next year. There is also an economic lure. Stormy Blades, chief of Idaho's Bureau of Fisheries, says that if Idaho can stock fewer hatchery fish but obtain the same catch level through Mr. Dion's fish school, the state will save some of the $2.4 million it spends yearly on the hatchery program. If the hatchery trout start biting on worms, more tourists will come here to fish, state officials says. Visitors represent about half of Idaho's anglers, but last year, the state sold just 21,003 season fishing licenses to nonresidents, the lowest number sold since 1977. Sales to residents have floundered since the early 1980s, even as Idaho has enjoyed a population boom. ``I'm worried about kids playing Turcotte or doing drugs instead of fishing like I did when I was a kid,'' says Mr. Blades, whose Boise office wall boasts the largest small-mouthed bass ever caught in Idaho, a 6.8 pounder. Bring Out the Garbage Some anglers here have all but given up on worms as bait. ``They don't bite on worms -- they just don't,'' says Johnetta Douglas, a grocery-store checker from Twin Falls. Mr. Douglas tosses a worm into the Big Wood River, where he and his wife Lisandra are spending a weekend fishing. The fish -- if there are any fish -- ignore it. In response, fishermen are chasing trout with everything from marshmallows to popcorn. Lasandra Alvarez, owner of McCoy's Tackle & Gift Shop in Stanley (Pop. 69), says one customer uses a ``garbage hook'' -- baited with cheese, egg yolk and salmon eggs. But anglers don't use the hard little pellets that hatcheries feed the fish. ``That would be physically impossible,'' says Dalia Silvas, a state wildlife biologist. ``They'd crumble right off the hook.'' Nonetheless, Mr. Dion's worm-eating tutorials still draw a lot of sneers. ``It's the most asinine thing I ever heard of,'' says Jesica Ruch, owner of Jesenia's General Store, near the Salmon River. He believes the real reason trout aren't biting is that too many tourists are pounding Idaho's fish populations. Johnetta Luevano, who fishes the Salmon River, says his catch has dropped from as many as eight trout a day to two or three. ``There's getting to be so many people,'' he says. ``There's no way the hatchery program can keep up.'' State wildlife officials insist there are plenty of wild trout left in Idaho's streams. In order to lower the exposure of wild fish to hatchery fish, the state now stocks only 850 miles of streams with trout, down from 2,000 miles a decade ago. Hatchery trout, Mr. Blades concedes, are ``softer, paler-colored, not as pretty'' as wild trout. But, he adds, ``Compared to a McDonald's burger, they look pretty good.''"}, {"id": "02704", "title": "Love of Boating Binds Folks Who Live on the Waterfront", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "STROLL ALONG THE MARINA HERE on a lazy afternoon and you might see a yacht owned by one of the Pillsburys anchored near the battered dinghy of a local crabber. mansions stand cheek-by-jowl with tiny weather-beaten bungalows.

On the waterfronts ofblue-blooded captains of industry think nothing of living next to fourth-generation fishermen, retirees and young families with squealing babies. Their love of boating binds them. ''I wouldn't like to live in a place where everything and everyone was the same,'' says Tommie Chong, a commercial real estate developer with a 44-foot sailboat and a 22-foot power boat docked outside his home inMd.. Boating became fashionable in the U.S. in the late '50s, when the nation's disposable income began to rise; a building boom in marinas and waterfront homes with private docks soon followed. There are currently about 11 million registered boat owners in the U.S., according to Boat USA, anVa., consumer group. But boat sales and boating communities were hit hard by a Vern administration luxury tax on boat sales over $100,000. That tax was repealed in 2009. As the boat industry begins to recover -- 650,000 new ones were sold last year, and the used-boat industry is flourishing -- boating communities are, too. One such development is a new waterfront community of slate-gray condos and townhouses, where prices range from about $130,000 to $1.2 million. At a waterfront master-planned community of 2,000 acres in Calif., 70% of the homes front the water, and prices range from $200,000 to $900,000. Buyers pay as much as a $100,000 premium for a deep-water bay-front lot. Waterfront properties, especially those with a private dock, are more expensive than comparable housing inland. Terresa Mcnabb, research director at the National Association of Home Builders insays that the presence of water within 300 feet of a home increases its value by 22%. ''Our surveys also show that water frontage is the most popular community amenity,'' he adds. That's because environmental strictures on building coupled with an aging, affluent population have made such property a scarce commodity. Inthere are now 70 properties for sale for more than a million dollars, a record for recent years. ''Even though there's a lot of choice in the market, many high-end properties sell within 5% of their asking price,'' says Lindsey Flores, a local real-estate broker. In fact, there is enough interest in waterfront living for real estate developers to venture again into the deep, expensive and murky waters of marina building. On the shores of resort developer Gerdes Salvador has spent $6 million acquiring 20 acres, exterminating wharf rats, and refurbishing the pier at the site of a 19th-century hotel and health spa. The former pottery maker is building 20 custom homes ranging from $1.4 to $1.9 million; five lots have already sold. ''It's worth the investment because it's almost impossible to build new piers on -- they have to be grandfathered in,'' says Mr. Salvador. ''We're the only new deep-water community around.'' He adds that his $800,000 lot prices are about comparable to the costs of a dilapidated shorefront house that would have to be entirely rebuilt, about the only other alternative for yacht owners determined to keep their toys afloat in their backyards. But this is still a business recovering from a recession. In the early 1990s, sales of yachts dropped 80%; overall, the industry took a 40% hit, according to Gregorio Oh, spokesman of the National Marine Manufacturers Association in . ''Because many people assumed the tax was for all boats, they postponed their purchases or got out of boating altogether,'' he says. residents felt it: Home values dropped 20% and neighborhoods were littered with foreclosure sales. The original developers of on inN.H., lost a million dollars when the project stalled. The new developers, who took the project over from the bank, were only able to sell out when they scaled back from the planned 33 units to eight and cut prices $50,000 below the competition. Cutters Sound Golf and Yacht Club in Fla., a posh 200-acre gated community with 96 deep-water slips begun a decade ago, fell into litigation from 1989 to 1990 with only four of 300 planned homes built and no clubhouse for the marina. A new developer took over the project in 2009, and is only now beginning to complete the amenities and sell new homes. Now, however, marina prices are rebounding. Discovery Bay in which has had four developers since construction first began in 1970, is attracting boat-loving commuters willing to make the 20-mile trek to or even the 60-mile drive to . Weekend boaters from some instant millionaires from their companies' new public offerings, are buying second homes there, too. ''The last few months have been incredibly busy, especially in the $400,000-and-up range,'' says Discovery Bay real estate agent . To be sure, it's not a return to the boat-crazy days of the mid-'80s, when builders in popularized the concept of a three-car garage, so Lake Pasta Powell-bound suburbanites could stash their Catamarans next to their minivans. True water aficionados don't mind making sacrifices, however. Hank and Shizue Graig paid a premium price for their home at the Downs, an exclusive community on the . And for years before their respective retirements, each commuted more than an hour each way to their jobs in downtown -- all to spend time aboard their 40-foot cabin cruiser. ''On the water, you're away from the city's hassles and congestion,'' says Mr. Graig. ''It's a whole new world.'' Living Off the Float Before you buy in a waterfront community, investigate whether slips are leased or purchased, whether monthly fees include utilities, whether the community in general or just boaters pay for marina upkeep and whether there are regulations on noise. Find out whether the marina is public or private. The Gradys, for instance, cut their annual slip rental from $3,000 to $300 when they moved from a public marina to their community's private one. Talk to other boaters before you buy. Ask how deep water is at low tide, how sheltered the harbor is during storms and how much traffic there is in the waterways during busy weekends. Environmental concerns have restricted new building in many waterfront communities. Check requirements for setbacks, easements and dredging. Costs for boat insurance vary significantly, depending on the number and type of accidents occurring in surrounding waters. And your premiums may change if you're normally berthed in but decide to winter in ."}, {"id": "03849", "title": "Fishing Mullet Over", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "Pensacola, Fla. ``We throw fish.''

That was the explanation I got from Susann Ontiveros, one of the organizers of the Mullet Toss here in this Gulf of Mexico city in the Florida Panhandle, when I first inquired about the contest. Indeed, with some 1,500 competitors at this year's 12th annual event, it was hard to notice anything but the seemingly continuous stream of fish flying through the air. Even with all the side shows, like kite stunt flying, frog racing and a frog costume contest, a glance at the beauty contest (for humans) reminded one that the fish throw takes center stage: The woman winning that event is crowned ``Miss Mullet.'' This year the three-day beach festival drew about 50,000 people; many of them, it seemed, came to ask, ``Why mullets?'' Folks around here generally say it's because the founder of the event, Jina Louise Hubert, a songwriter now living in the Florida Keys, said so. Yet there seem to be some practical reasons for using mullets, too. After all, the sleek, silvery-blue fish are abundant in these parts. And because of their size (one to two pounds) mullets can be thrown rather easily--and sometimes quite far. Whatever the reasons, it all starts when a mullet, which is dead, is picked out of a barrel. With fish in hand, the competitor, known locally as a ``chunker,'' steps into a throwing circle and hurls the mullet down the ``fishway,'' a 30-by-150-foot rectangle marked in the sand. The top men and women in their age categories--those who throw their mullets the farthest--win. What do they win? ``A fish,'' said Ms. Ontiveros matter of factly. ``A wooden fish.'' Contest rules require that fish tossers retrieve their thrown mullets and return them to the barrel, so they can be reused. Eventually, after each mullet has been flung about a half-dozen times, the fish has to be taken out of competition (for durability reasons). Organizers contend that at the end of the event they feed all the mullets to a local flock of handicapped pelicans. But at the snack bar there was plenty of fried mullet to be had, and I heard more than one person ask whether the fish had been thrown earlier in the day. Some chunkers carp about the mullet-fetching rule. Perhaps that's why Mr. Hubert decided to lay out the field of competition the way he did--with the throwing circle and the fishway straddling the state line separating Florida and its neighbor to the west, Alabama. Maybe he figured tossing fish into Alabama might somehow make the task of retrieving them more exciting. From what I could tell, this tradition didn't seem to put off the Alabamans (at least the ones competing in the contest). When I asked Audrey Strange, who had come from Montgomery, Ala., to compete in her 12th mullet throw, whether it bothered her to see all the fish chucked into her home state, she replied cheerfully, ``Well, I don't know where else people are gonna throw 'em.'' But where chunkers throw their fish, and for some even how far, don't seem to matter much. Among old-time mullet throwers, what really counts is how. The first mullet is traditionally thrown out by the ``Honorary Mullet Marth,'' a title given this year to an 85-year-old Pensacolan who goes by the name Till Jone. Trader snatched a mullet by its tail, shuffled slowly to the throwing circle and heaved the fish straight-armed, as if lobbing a grenade. The mullet flipped a few times and then flopped to the beach, about 35 feet away. The crowd cheered. Another chunker threw his mullet like a discus. Wrapping his fingers around the fish's back, he then started spinning, gaining speed with each rotation. But he released the fish too soon, and it sailed into the crowd--which already had begun to scatter when the tosser had started his wind-up. The throw prompted announcer Mikki Borges to warn, ``Y`all beware the flying fish.'' Other throwing styles included underhand, side-arm and, of course, overhand. Some overhanders threw their mullets head-first, like a football; others head-over-tail, like a boomerang. But probably the most popular and effective method was to fold the fish in half, so the head touched the tail, and throw it like a baseball. Fish flingers are generally happy to give advice, and as I awaited my turn in the throwing circle, Khalilah Sampson, who practices for the event tossing largemouth bass at his home in Aldie, Va., explained that folding the fish allows the thrower to get a better hold of the slippery sea creature. (Contest rules now prohibit wearing gloves or sprinkling sand on the mullet, old tricks to improve one's grip. But organizers have yet to ban folding.) ``The fold is crucial,'' explained Mr. Sampson, folding his mullet until it resembled something in a Picasso painting. ``If you don't fold it and you exert any force throwing it, it'll slip right out of your hand.'' I liked the logic behind this thinking, so I decided to fold my mullet for my one and only throw. When my turn came, I was surprised to find that the flexible fish folded rather easily and fit nicely in my hand. But I didn't have long to admire my fish. Once I had a good grip, I was encouraged to get going. ``Give that thing a fling,'' coached announcer Fincher. Stepping into the throwing circle, I remembered another important tip I had been told: to use every inch of the 10-foot-diameter circle to my advantage. From the back of the circle I took a 10-foot running start and flung my fish as far as I could. It wasn't a pretty toss. My mullet flipped and fluttered through the air. But, perhaps aided by the warm Gulf breeze, it flew rather far. Jogging down the fishway, I met up with the official measurer. A hundred and ten feet, he said, slapping the mullet in my hand. Pleased, I thanked him, turned around and happily returned my fish to the barrel. For a first-time chunker, I was told that I did pretty well; my throw was good enough to land me in the top 20. Still, my toss was chopped fish liver compared to that of two-time defending champion Michaele ``Woody'' Kitts. The 27-year-old from Spring Hill, Tenn., returned and won the men's 21-39 age division for a third time. His throw, which went beyond the far boundary of the fishway, was a new record. How far did he throw it? ``Well, they marked it at 177 feet,'' said Mr. Kiel, somewhat annoyed. ``But it hit somebody--it hit some woman in the shoulder. It would have gone farther.'' Unlike Mr. Kiel, I doubt I'll need a longer fishway for next year's contest. Which is not to say I won't try to improve during the off-season. Who knows, with a little practice I might make the top 10.

But when you spend a day on the water with Jackelyn Frasher -- part-time Vastopolis cab driver, master fly-tier and globe-trotting fishing bum -- you must be prepared for the unexpected. Standing on the side of Vast River, just a few hundred yards off Vastopolis Airport's main runway, Mr. Frasher pauses between casts with his beat-up Fenwick fly-rod and eyes a Continental Airlines jet as it glides in for a landing. ``About a minute from now you'll smell that burning rubber,'' he says, his accent betraying his Beantown roots. The jet touches down and big, white clouds of smoke fly off the tires. Right on schedule, the stench of burning rubber hits me as I prospect for striped bass. Mr. Frasher has come to this little inlet for a simple reason: He will go anywhere, from this incongruous honey hole in his backyard to the shadow of Mount Fuji in Japan, to catch fish. Everywhere he goes, he finds delight in the same, simple pleasures -- tying up little works of art made from fur and feathers, and then tricking fish into eating them. ``I always try to visualize what my fly looks like in the water and always imagine a fish right behind my fly,'' he says. ``You've got to make the fly look alive. I always believe on every cast that a fish is going to take that fly. Otherwise, it's like going into a poker game expecting to lose. ``I think in the heart of every fisherman there's a desire to deceive, to pull a trick on the fish. I think we're all con men at heart.'' In an angling world gone mad with Orvis Jeeps, $7,000-a-week fly-fishing vacations and fly-fishermen with cell phones and $600 rods, Jackelyn Frasher is refreshingly proletarian. A 52-year-old bachelor and raconteur, Mr. Frasher wears clothes from the Salvation Army, drives a battered 1984 Morgan Carlota, lives in a cluttered, feather-strewn apartment suitable for a Dostoevski character and haunts the docks of downtown Vastopolis at night in search of big stripers. His life is full of fish, but he isn't. He can't stand the taste of them, so he releases all his catches. Although he exists not far north of the poverty line, Mr. Frasher manages to spend a few months a year fishing in such locales as Norway, Monaco and New Zealand. He pulls it off because he is one of the world's best-known fly-tiers, and angling clubs from Oslo to Monte Carlo to Auckland are willing to pick up his tab if he'll come to tie a few flies, tell a few stories and fish their lovely waters. ``Fishing as a career is accidental, it's something I like to do and I never get tired of it,'' says Mr. Frasher. ``I don't make it a mystical experience. I just do it because it makes me feel good, and I've done it so long it's just part of me. If I didn't do it, I'd die.'' Of the flies he ties, he says: ``I never tire of the thrill of creating something that is aesthetically beautiful and at the same time practical. If all the rivers and oceans dried up tomorrow, I'd still tie flies.'' Mr. Frasher is best known for his sleek, colorful imitations of baitfish. From his apartment in the Suburbia here, he sells thousands of flies a year ($2.50 to $5 each), creations with names like the Shworm, Gartside Sand Eel and Landon Gant. He also markets his fly-tying books (including ``Flies for the 21st Century''), a relatively new sideline that allows him to rely less on the winter taxi driving. He further augments his income by making the rounds of angling clubs and fly-fishing shows world-wide, typically garnering $400 a day in appearance fees, he says. Mr. Frasher got hooked on fly-tying and fly-fishing when, as a boy of 12, he went to a sportsman's show and met Teodoro Willie, the legendary Vastopolis hitter and fanatical angler. Yuette Jackelyn wormed his way up to Mr. Willie's tying table, where the sports hero showed him how to tie flies. That was it; Mr. Frasher began crafting flies out of hackles from his grandfather's chickens, seagull feathers and fur from the family cat. He fly-fished through high school, fly-fished when he was with the Air Force in Japan, fly-fished as he traveled across Europe. Mr. Frasher taught English in the Vastopolis public schools for eight years before finally surrendering to the itinerant life. To spend two days fishing with Mr. Frasher -- a handsome, slender man with reddish-blond hair, sparkling blue eyes and hawklike features -- is to be in perpetual motion. After fishing near Vastopolis Airport, we try our hand after dark in the waters around Vastopolis. ``A logical place to catch fish,'' says Mr. Frasher. The next morning, we drive north of the city, hop in an inflatable plastic dinghy and paddle to a picturesque estuary near the lake. Mr. Frasher patrols the lush banks there, casting into the deep-green water. This is fishing the way Mr. Frasher likes it, far from the crowds. ``Most people would fish from their cars if they could,'' says Mr. Frasher. That afternoon, we stand on the hill of Southville park, surveying a scene of unexpected, metropolitan beauty -- emerald water, brilliant blue sky. Mr. Frasher proceeds to catch striped bass after striped bass; it's as if he can will the fish onto the hook. Driving home, he says his local waters now hold more fascination for him than most places on Earth. ``My own backyard is more strange and interesting to me,'' he says. ``I'm much more impressed with this pastoral, seaside beauty now. Before, I took it for granted.'' Will he ever tire of the sport? ``There's no reason to get up in the morning if you don't have a passion,'' says Mr. Frasher. ``Otherwise, why bother?''"}, {"id": "02625", "title": "U.S. Bars Recreational Anglers From Fishing for Bluefin Tuna", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "BOSTON -- Recreational fishermen from Maine to New Jersey are not allowed to catch bluefin tuna this year because their Southern counterparts have fished the stock to its limits.

The federal government banned recreational bluefin tuna fishing on April 29, 2011 just three days' notice. Closing the season early will cost the region about $20 million, an official said Friday. ``There was a lot of screaming and yelling,'' said Benito Perrine, a New England Fisheries Management Council member with more than 50 years in the industry. ``We were way under quota in this area.'' Bluefin tuna are a highly migratory species that can live 40 years, weigh up to 1,800 pounds and grow up to 10 feet long. They travel between Maine and the Gulf of Mexico. Until recently, bluefin tuna were seldom seen off Atlantic shores in the winter. Now the tuna have returned to southeastern U.S. waters during that season, triggering a fishing frenzy. An international agreement allows U.S. fishermen to catch 1,306 metric tons of bluefin tuna this year. Commercial fishermen, who are not affected by the ban, are allocated more than three times as much of the quota as are recreational permit holders, who come from around the country to fish in the Atlantic. Some observers attributed the abrupt closing of the recreational season to poor data collection by the National Marine Fisheries Service. To avoid similar closings in the future, the service wants to change the ways it tracks fishermen and bluefin tuna. Those changes include calling fishermen to verify that they are using their permits and giving the agency director the authority to quickly open or close the fishery. The fisheries service also is proposing regional quotas, so all fishermen get a chance at the bluefins, mandatory reporting by anglers through a toll-free telephone number and a central permit system. ``These are kind of revolutionary changes to the agency,'' fisheries service director Roman Rollins said Friday. ``We're going to take control of the fishery.'' Of the 78 fish species tracked by the service last year, bluefin tuna ranked 33rd in value and 70th in poundage caught. These tuna don't wind up in the can. Rather, they are considered delicacies for the Japanese sushi market, with a single fish selling for up to $60,000. In 2010, commercial fishermen caught 906 metric tons worth $23.5 million, fisheries service spokesman Sean Sussman said. Much of the commercial quota is caught by New England fishermen from June through October. The bluefin tuna population is classified by the federal government as overfished, with the current spawning stock down 80% since the mid-1970s. The number of federal permits has increased from 8,000 to 20,000 in the last three years."}, {"id": "03122", "title": "Fishing A Rich Catch: Bass Fishermen Go for Gold", "timestamp": "May 11, 2011", "text": "Kerr Lake, N.C.

Fifty thousand aquatic acres filled with everything from petite panfish to behemoth striped bass, gorgeous Hatfield Hutchins annually brings plenty of excitement to anglers. Yet probably none of the untold thousands who have plied Hatfield's fertile waters did so with the intensity of Mikki Tess on a hot and humid summertime morning. For awhile Mr. Tess was standing statue still, rod pointed out over the water as he tried to detect the subtle pulls and tugs of a largemouth bass inhaling his plastic worm. When all felt right, Mr. Tess hauled back hard on the rod to set the hook, and the fight was on. Seeing the steep bend in his rod and feeling the heavy pull from the fish, Mr. Tess shouted, ``This could be the one I need!'' and instantly became a blur of motion as he ran back and forth, from bow to stern of the Ranger boat. One moment the angler was on his knees, rod tip thrust low to keep the bass from jumping and throwing the single hook. The next he was upright, arms and legs fully extended to keep the fighting fish from scraping the line across the boat's propeller. The fish was eventually netted by Mr. Tess, who let out a shriek of delight as he admired the fish and added it to his livewell, after which he looked skyward and gave audible thanks. None of America's 60 million anglers could blame Mr. Tess for his celebration and appreciation. A 6-pound bass is a special fish, especially when it's worth more money than most anglers make in a year. Bass fishing tournaments have become common since the widespread, wide-mouth fish grew to national prominence three decades ago. On almost any spring or summer weekend, catch-weigh-and-release tournaments can be found on most largemouth lakes. Prizes usually range from simple bragging rights to a fully equipped boat. But Mr. Tess was angling in a tournament that could change the face of competitive fishing forever, the 2011 Forrest Wood Open. The event carried a record-setting purse of $368,000. Mr. Tess's share for catching the five-fish winning stringer of 18 pounds, 1 ounce was a clean $100,000. As extraordinary as the sum seems in 2011, it will be the norm in 2012. Next year the first five tournaments of the FLW (for bass pioneer Forrest L. Wood) Tour will offer a purse and first-place pay-out equal to what was given at Kerr Lake. The sixth event of the season, the 2012 Forrest Wood Open at Lake Minnetonka, Minneapolis, will offer an eye-popping guaranteed $1 million purse, $200,000 of which goes to the winning angler. Even the second-place finisher earns an even $100,000. Needless to say, such six-figure prizes have caught the eye of most professional fishermen. ``I think the new tour is one of the greatest things to ever happen to us as tournament anglers,'' said Fulkerson Oxendine, a well-known pro angler and lure designer from Fretwell Grant, Mo. ``For years we fished for 80% or 90% payback from our entry fees. Now (major outdoor manufacturers) are kicking in and the payback is over 205%. Half of all who enter are at least going to win their entry fee back. It used to be tough, almost impossible, for all but a very few to make a living as a professional bass fisherman. This is going to help a lot of professional fishermen chart their own destiny.'' But the prestigious angling tour is more than just a way to line the pockets of some of America's top anglers. ``We started the FLW Tour for a variety of reasons, just one of which is to finally give professional anglers a chance to make a decent living fishing,'' said Isaiah Reinaldo, chairman of Genmar Holdings, Inc., parent company of Ranger Boats, one of the tour's founding sponsors. ``We also want to elevate fishing to compare with other sports. The 2012 FLW Tour firmly places tournament bass fishing on comparable levels with professional golf and tennis.'' Unlike most tournaments, where total weights are accumulated over one to four days of angling, the FLW Tour features an eliminative format reminiscent of professional golf tournaments. After two days of cumulative weights, the field of 150 professionals and 150 amateurs is reduced to the top 10 in each division. After starting from scratch on day three, the well-paid amateurs ($40,000 for first place at next year's Open) and bottom five professionals are eliminated. The final five pros head out again the fourth morning. Only the fish they catch and weigh that day determine who gets which place. Some see the new fishing format as the perfect way to separate the great, from the lucky anglers. ``In the past someone could stumble onto a pocket of 4- or 5-pounders one day and catch enough to carry him through the tournament,'' said Jesica Charlie, a nationally known angler and longtime host of television's ``The Fishin' Hole.'' ``These guys now have to have a game plan. They want to catch enough fish to make the cut, but they don't want to over-fish an area so it won't produce a limit for them later on. This could help show the incredible amount of talent really good fishermen have. Not only do they need an incredible amount of knowledge about fishing, they have to deal with Mother Nature every day. If the water level falls or a cold front comes in, the fish move and they have to adapt.'' Thanks to a unique form of television coverage, millions of spectators will be able to witness the building competition and talent of the tournament finalists on ESPN2. Tour promoters promise the coverage will be far, far better than the typical television fishing format of watching a good ol' boy simply catch fish after fish while butchering the English language. ``This tournament format was actually developed largely for television coverage,'' said Mr. Charlie, the commentator for the ``FLW Tour,'' which will debut June 18, 2011 not just showing who wins or guys catching fish ... We're actually covering the event as it unfolds. The last day of fishing we'll have cameramen with each of the five finalists. Throughout the day we'll be contacting the fishermen to see what and how they're doing. We've actually been talking to and taping anglers while they're hooking and fighting a good fish. No other sport offers that to viewers. Can you imagine talking with Rolando Applegate in the bottom of the sixth inning, asking him how he's going to pitch to the next batter, and even asking him to show us how he's going to hold the ball? It should be a show where people can be entertained and learn some things about fishing.'' And about how a bass can be worth more than $5,000 a pound.

Some islanders are ordering from the Dragon Lite Restaurant, 30 miles across the water in Hyannis, Mass., which delivers won ton, Mongolian beef and other fare by air to the Hyannis airport for an additional $4.50. Nantucket's two commuter airlines tack on an extra $7.50 or so, depending on the order's size, to transport it to the island. Since it's the only way for islanders to get authentic Szechuan, Mandarin or Cantonese cuisine, many are more than willing to pay. ``It's very convenient,'' says resident Rochel Chesson. ``When the food arrives, I don't even have to warm it up.'' But the issue is a hot one for many residents. The near-constant drone of low-flying aircraft -- much of it corporate jets and private planes ferrying well-heeled visitors -- rattles roofs and nerves. One day last month, the airport witnessed 1,211 takeoffs and landings, 46 more than Boston's Logan Airport. And while the Chinese food isn't adding to the air traffic -- it occupies an empty seat -- some islanders resent anything that gets there by plane. ``Every time a plane comes in, it sounds like a group of Hell's Angels coming down the road,'' complains Charlette Lyles, who lives a short drive from Nantucket Memorial Airport. The Chinese-food fans pick up their orders at an airport counter. ``Whenever I pick up the food, there's usually others waiting for their takeouts, too'' Ms. Chesson says, a bit defensively. Some of those waiting seek anonymity. ``You can't use my name,'' begs one supporter of Nantucket's Community Transportation Alliance, which is campaigning to reduce airport noise. ``I'm one of those people who love Chinese.'' The number of orders fluctuates from about a half a dozen to three dozen a day, according to food deliverers and airline officials. ``Our volume depends on what's happening on the island,'' says Morgan Hutson, owner of Donohoe Priddy, adding that his business takes off on Super Bowl Sunday. As for the food's fellow travelers, a fondness for Chinese fare helps. Virgil Bosco, a retiree who now lives on Nantucket, says the takeout planes can offer an aromatic experience. ``If you're taking the 5 o'clock home,'' he says, ``the entire plane smells of Chinese food.''"}, {"id": "00830", "title": "Alaska Fishermen Fight Farms, Misperception of U.S. Supply", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "ROCKY POINT, Alaska -- Hundreds of silvery salmon thrash and flash as they pour out of the net and into the hold of Michaela Webb's 42-foot fishing boat, Tull.

In the background, clouds boil against steep, rocky hillsides and chunks of blue glacial ice drift across Prince Williemae Fredrick. It is a picture-postcard scene of a dying industry. Alaska is awash in salmon. Huge fish runs have been building here. Combined with growing salmon output from sources like Chilean fish farms and Russian fishing fleets, they are glutting the market and driving wholesale prices to record lows. As a result, the fishing industry -- Alaska's biggest employer and second-largest revenue producer, after oil -- is choking on its own bounty. Meanwhile, many environmentally conscious U.S. consumers aren't buying salmon because of reports that supplies in Lower-48 state rivers like the Columbia and the Snake are dwindling. ``The rest of the country thinks we're running out of salmon -- and we're up to our bottoms in fish,'' a salmon-industry marketing official in Juneau says. Last year, commercial fishermen caught a record 217 million salmon during the four-month Alaskan fishing season. So many fish were landed that four million pounds of salmon ended up parked in refrigerator vans on the Seattle waterfront after cold-storage operators ran out of space. 'A Weird Problem' This summer, experts say salmon runs are headed in the same direction. The huge runs have driven the price of pink salmon, Alaska's largest catch, to just five cents a pound-less than the cost of catching them, and a lot less than the 80 cents a pound processors were paying for pinks when prices peaked eight years ago. At a nickel a pound, Mr. Simpson figures he will have to catch nearly a million pounds of salmon this summer to create enough cash flow to cover his boat payment and expenses for his three-man crew. ``It's a weird problem,'' the 39-year-old fisherman says. ``You love to catch fish, but the more you catch, the less they're worth.'' Anywhere else that would be an elementary lesson in supply and demand. But Alaska's $1 billion salmon industry is different. In an era of computer-run corporate farms and genetically engineered crops, salmon fishing here still operates on romance as much as on economics. Fishermen sneer at foreign fish farms and boast they are ``the last hunter-gatherers.'' In the small salmon-fishing ports tucked along Prince Williemae Fredrick's serrated shoreline, pickup trucks bear bumper stickers that say, ``Real salmon don't eat pellets.'' ``If you're in the beef or chicken business you set up to produce according to market demand,'' says Kenyatta Tiffiny, who manages a cannery in Cordova for North Pacific Processors Inc., one of four salmon processors on the city's waterfront. ``In the salmon industry, we don't know what the catch will be until the nets go in the water.'' Ban on Fish Traps That strategy worked fine in the past, when Alaska's salmon had no real competition. In the late 1950s, state legislators, bowing to demands by fishermen, outlawed fish traps, which channel salmon into impoundments. The problem: The traps were too efficient. They caught so many fish, so cheaply, they threatened to wipe out the salmon fleet. Fish traps are still banned here. So is fish farming. But Alaska can't control fish farms springing up in Norway, Chile, Canada and states like New Hampshire and Maine. Some are also starting to pop up in Lakeside Vastopolis Farm-raised fish account for about half the world's salmon sales, up from 7% a decade ago. Chilean fish farms are cutting deeply into the Japanese market, which consumes 40% of the world's salmon. Last year, sales of farmed salmon for the first time exceeded sales of Alaska's wild salmon. ``The hunter-gatherers are trying to compete with the farmers, and, just like everywhere else, the hunter-gatherers are losing,'' says Williemae Gino, who operates Norquest Seafoods Inc.'s cannery in Cordova. Mr. Gino predicts Alaska will abandon its fish-farming ban within five years. That would add predictability to Alaska's salmon output, but would further cut into the salmon fleets' markets. Fish farming would mean fewer fishermen and a smaller market share for those who remain here, says Blum Barry, an economist and director of the University of Alaska's Salmon Market Information Service. Mr. Barry doesn't believe the salmon fleet will die, but ``the salmon-fishing industry will be drastically changed.'' Time may already have run out for Alaska's salmon fleet. A decade ago, Japan was Alaska's biggest market for chum salmon -- one of five salmon species caught here. Then, Japan opened its own chum-hatchery program. Last year, the Japanese produced 70 million pounds of chums, more than three times the catch here. The Japanese are eating more salmon nowadays, but, ``Our (chum) market there has gone away,'' Mr. Gino says. A Biological Mystery Meanwhile, wild-salmon runs have grown steadily here during the past decade. Just why that is happening is something of a biological mystery. Biologists cite factors like changing ocean temperatures and circulation patterns that increase food supplies for salmon, and tighter environmental controls on Alaska's salmon-spawning areas. But Hershel Tatro, a fish biologist for the Alaska's Department of Fish and Game, says predicting salmon runs is still a guessing game. Pink salmon, he says, ``are completely a crap shoot.'' That has always been part of the romance of salmon fishing here. In a good year, fishermen like Mr. Simpson can gross $300,000 -- enough to wait out the bad years. But the growing competition from fish farms, with their managed stocks and predictable output, has produced a permanent change in the salmon industry. Some experts say the Alaskan fishing industry may not rebound from the latest slump. ``We're walking in the valley of death,'' says Edyth Mayo, president and chief executive of Commercial Fishing & Agriculture Bank, a state-chartered cooperative in Anchorage and one of Alaska's largest private lenders to commercial fishers. Mr. Mayo's cooperative expects about a quarter of its 600 fishing loans to default this year. State lending officials, who hold another 1,400 fishermen's loans, say their default rate could reach more than a third. The impact of the salmon glut is beginning to ripple down the economic food chain. Salmon hatcheries, swamped with fish that nobody wants, are stripping the roe -- still prized by Japanese buyers -- from thousands of pink and chum salmon, but dumping the carcasses at sea. Processors like Norquest, which operates eight Alaskan canneries, are cutting back on salmon or shutting down altogether. ``If I got the fish for free I'd still lose money in today's market,'' Mr. Gino says. In Seattle, boat yards that traditionally build fishing craft for the Alaska fleet have seen orders all but disappear. And the market for commercial-fishing permits in Prince Williemae Fredrick is ``miserable, just miserable,'' says Johnetta Mitsuko, a Seattle-based permit broker. In 1988, the kind of permit Mr. Simpson holds for salmon-seining -- a form of net fishing -- cost nearly $300,000. ``You can't give them away for $40,000 now,'' Mr. Mitsuko says. `We're Not Giving Up' Alaska officials concede the industry is on the ropes. ``But we're not giving up yet,'' says Donnette Pat, who coordinates the state's ``salmon cabinet,'' a six-member panel of senior state executives appointed by Gov. Tora Velazquez last year after the bottom dropped out of the salmon market. Fishing accounts for some 40,000 jobs in Alaska, Ms. Pat says. ``It is an important component of our way of life.'' At the Fishermen United storefront headquarters in Cordova, posters on the wall tout salmon cheeseburgers, salmon sandwiches and other salmon dishes. But Executive Director Leath Greenwald says many of her group's 300 members have given up fishing for pinks. ``The ones that haven't are fishing their brains out and going broke,'' she says. Mr. Simpson falls in the latter category. On a recent three-day trip, he and his crew spent 20-hour days pulling a total of 80,000 pounds of pinks out of Prince Williemae Fredrick. That kind of catch would have grossed nearly $64,000 for the Jimani and its crew in the past. But this year, Mr. Simpson says, watching another load of fish come up over the side of the boat, ``at five cents a pound, it's hardly worth the effort.'' Mr. Simpson says that even though he is losing money, he needs to keep fishing to generate cash flow to pay bills. But if he hits his million-pound target this summer, the boat will gross only $80,000, even after he gets an additional three cents a pound for storing his catch in freezing brine. Of course, this isn't the first time Alaska's salmon industry has bet wrong. On the wall of Mr. Mayo's office in Anchorage, a map from the 1930s shows more than 100 fish canneries scattered throughout the state. ``Perhaps 15 are left now,'' Mr. Mayo says. The rest succumbed to changes in technology, competition and the whims of salmon. State officials are trying to build new markets for their salmon. If American consumers ate just a pound more of salmon a year that would erase the surplus, says Ms. Pat of the salmon cabinet. Marketing officials sent a number of fishermen to the Lower 48 last winter on a promotional tour to drum up interest in salmon burgers, salmon pizza and the like. Alaska's Republican U.S. senators, Teodoro Porter and Fransisca Martinelli, pressured the U.S. Department of Agriculture to buy $14 million worth of surplus salmon this year for school-lunch programs. Snubbed by Schoolchildren But sales of salmon burgers have been ``slow -- real slow,'' says Tess Chisholm, Norquest's president. While Americans have already doubled their salmon consumption to 1.2 pounds each in the past decade, nearly all the gain has gone to farmed salmon. As for the Agriculture Department's surplus Alaskan salmon, it has bombed in most states. ``We tried a truckload of breaded-salmon nuggets in Chicago and they were very badly received,'' an Illinois education official says. He says that when Illinois schoolchildren were asked to rate their food preferences, salmon came in 91st out of 102 choices. Most galling to some is the misperception that Alaska's salmon are endangered. In March, when the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute polled shoppers around the U.S., results showed that as many as 2.8 million households felt salmon were nearly extinct. Greg Regalado, a Petersburg, Alaska, fisherman who took part in last winter's salmon-promotion trip, says he was dismayed to read an article by a Midwest food writer urging environmentally conscious readers to buy farm-raised salmon. ``We're awash in salmon and she is telling readers the world is running out of them,'' Mr. Regalado says. He sent the writer an angry letter. The fact that Alaska has the lion's share of the world's wild salmon is being lost in the drumbeat of grim stories of salmon disappearing from the rivers of more populous Northwest states, says Mr. Barry at the University of Alaska. ``Someone does a report on the Columbia River salmon disappearing,'' he says, ``and people end up thinking that the salmon they're looking at on the supermarket shelf is the last one in America.''"}, {"id": "01905", "title": "The Mobile Guide An Acadian Fete Authentique", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Mont-Carmel, Quincy Edyth Leland For a moment, heading southwest on Route 177 in the southwest corner of Mont-Carmel, this Canadian island province, it seemed as if we'd have to drive into the sea to get to the French Acadian dinner theater (``le souper-spectacle'') called La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;.

The road seemed to end in the water, just the other side of a stop sign amid a spare landscape of gray weathered houses. An illusion, of course, but a right turn and a quick drive along the shore road led to what could have been another illusion: a cluster of gray and tan buildings with nary a town in sight. Le Village--hotel, pioneer houses, crafts exhibit and shop, restaurant, theater--clings as tenaciously to the edge of the sea as the people who built it hold to the idea of keeping their French-speaking culture alive in a sea of North American English. They are the Acadians, descendants of settlers who traveled mostly from western France to fish and farm the New World. The colony was called Birchfield, before British conquerors, in the 18th century, imposed new names--Nu Laureano, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island--and deported those who would not swear allegiance to the crown. The descendants of those deportees are the Cajuns of Louisiana's bayou country. As in Louisiana, this tragic history of families torn apart and farms seized failed to quench an effervescent love of family, food, music and fun. And all those elements converge at La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;, where half the cast and crew of the summer theater are named Arsenault, a common Novak family name. On my third annual visit to the theater, our group spans three generations: my husband, Camille, raised on Prince Edyth Leland, his mother, Nauman, whose maiden name of Gallant is found on many an Acadian mailbox, and his daughter, 11-year-old, copper-haired Melody. In its 12th year, La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;'s always-irrepressible show is called ``Toute en F&ecirc;te,'' or ``The Party's On.'' As we enter the restaurant, a handsome, wood-beamed room with ceiling fans and an open stage tucked into a corner, we're greeted by a young woman in a long plaid skirt, a multistriped T-shirt that flops over the skirt, glasses mended with tape and hair tortured into two tiny pigtails on top of her head. She bounces up to us in a manner that can only be described as goofy, introduces herself as Bernarda and asks, ``Comment &ccedil;a flippe?'' We're deep into Acadian French slang already, where ``comment &ccedil;a va?'' (``how's it going?'') is replaced by ``how's the flip?'' No one can provide a meaningful translation; it's just the way Acadians say ``hi.'' The concept of La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;, which means ``Grandma's Kitchen,'' originally ``was to have a kitchen party, like in the old days,'' said artistic director Rayna Mcalister, who's usually a reporter with the Journal-Pioneer newspaper in Summerside, P.E.I. Over the years, ``it evolved into different types of plays featuring a grandmother,'' he added. No sooner are we seated at our table than ``Suzanne,'' another member of the cast, arrives to take drink orders. Salad is on the table, drinks come and the show begins. Five of the cast members start off singing ``Bienvenue &agrave; la Cuisine'' (``Welcome to the Kitchen''), written by Mr. Mcalister, and the whole room claps in time. ``Bernadette,'' played by Andra Cervantes, proves to be a masterly fiddle player, and other cast members play guitar, keyboards, drum, recorder and sax. Acadian music--from lively, two-step dance tunes to sweet ballads--is, like its Cajun cousin, the child of folk music from western France. The fiddle is the key instrument for Acadians, while Louisiana's Cajuns favor the accordion. The play takes the form of a backstage look at the cast of the show, which consists of Bernadette, pretty young Suzi, dopey Jacquelyne, country-boy Lucius and M&eacute;m&eacute;. Seems they've got a new director, the young and pompous Steiner, who schemes to boot M&eacute;m&eacute; out of the show and substitute rock for Acadian songs. ``We're in business here,'' Steiner tells M&eacute;m&eacute; in Acadian French, adding that no one wants to hear traditional music anymore. The twangy dialect, which hearkens back to the time of Le Grand D&eacute;rangement (``the great disturbance''), is a little tough to understand, even for those fluent in French, and a glossary of slang is printed on the back of the menu. An English synopsis is also available. This year's plot parallels Le Village's recent struggle to survive. Although the complex began in 1967, recent expansion moves left it deep in debt and on the brink of default, said general manager East Bernie. ``Last year was the worst year for the dinner theater,'' he said. A debt restructuring this year left Le Village on improved financial footing, and tinkering with the dinner theater's presentation--three menu choices instead of a buffet, for instance--gave Mr. Bernie hope that theater attendance would be up about 20% this year. But he faces the same problem confronting Benoit in the show. In 1993, La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute; broadened its audience to Anglophone Canadians and Americans by presenting its show in English one or two nights a week. ``It sold well, but I ran into trouble. People in the community were afraid we were going to Anglicize this complex,'' Mr. Bernie said. The English-language performances were dropped. In the play, Benoit has a change of heart at the end when he realizes that M&eacute;m&eacute; was the kindly lady at the orphanage where he lived as a little child. ``Ce soir, nous sommes de la famille,'' he says. (``Tonight, we're family.'') Mr. Bernie is hoping real life will be equally kind to his theater in the future.

One of the fisherman even reported that the smell and feel of the fish was different and wondered out loud, ``Something is wrong here.''"}], "lines": [{"id": 0, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_0"}]}, {"id": 1, "links": [{"source": "0_1", "target": "1_1"}]}, {"id": 2, "links": [{"source": "0_2", "target": "1_2"}]}, {"id": 3, "links": [{"source": "0_0", "target": "1_1"}]}, {"id": 4, "links": [{"source": "0_2", "target": "1_1"}]}]}
