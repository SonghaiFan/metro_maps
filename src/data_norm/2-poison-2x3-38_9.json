It's the immediate, fixed annuity, the surest way to set up a steady stream of income that you can't outlive. Like money-market accounts and certificates of deposit, these annuities appeal to ``some kind of very basic, primal security need,'' says Ellis Weems, a fee-only financial planner in Atlanta. But, to get that security, you have to give up a lot. And if you change your mind, there often is no good way out. Much older seniors -- in their late 70s and beyond -- should be especially careful about taking the plunge, consumer advocates say. ``It makes less and less sense the older you get,'' says Bobby Ian, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. Immediate, fixed annuities have a more familiar cousin, the tax-deferred, variable annuity, which allows people to build up tax-deferred savings by investing in a basket of mutual funds. Insurance companies have marketed these deferred annuities as a way for baby boomers to fund a retirement kitty. Now, insurers are starting to focus on retirees and people leaving companies with lump-sum distributions from 401(k) and other retirement plans who are concerned about making their savings last the rest of their lives. Insurers say such folks are a natural match with immediate, fixed annuities, which convert an initial lump-sum premium into a series of monthly, quarterly or yearly payments guaranteed to last for life. While the industry has long ignored such ``payout annuities,'' it's ``starting to take a serious look,'' says Jesica Grace, president of the income management group for the Equitable Cos.' Equitable Life Assurance Society unit. Insurers that recently have rolled out immediate, fixed annuities include Equitable, First Colony Corp.'s First Colony Life Insurance Co. and Mutual of Omaha Cos.. When you buy a fixed annuity, you give the insurer a chunk of money that can be as little as $5,000 but often is more in the neighborhood of $50,000 or $100,000. The insurer agrees to pay you a set amount, representing a portion of your principal plus interest, for life. (The company makes its profit from investing your money and keeping the ``spread'' between whatever interest it earns and the interest it is committed to paying.) If the annuity isn't part of a qualified retirement plan, the portion of your payment that is a return of principal would be excluded from taxable income, says Lindsey Graig, a certified public accountant in New York. Insurers market immediate, fixed annuities as super-safe investments. But you are taking more risks than you might think. When you lock into a lifetime of level payments, you are doing nothing to guard against inflation. Even at a modest annual rate of 3% or 4%, you would have only half of your purchasing power after 20 years, Mr. Weems says. You also are gambling that you are going to live long enough to get your money back. If you have bought a $100,000 annuity and then die after collecting only $20,000, the insurer often gets to keep the rest. Unlike virtually all other investments, the money doesn't go to your heirs. Finally, since the insurer sets a fixed interest rate on the annuity at the time of purchase, you would be locking into today's low rates. ``Would you take your entire life savings and buy a 30-year Treasury today?'' asks Josephine M. Hitchcock, professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University. Insurers do sell some protection against these risks. One is a ``certain period,'' which guarantees payment for some years to an investor's beneficiaries if the investor dies. Many insurers also sell joint-and-survivor options, which pay spouses for the remainder of their lives after the investors die, or refund features, which return some or all of the remaining principal to beneficiaries. More recently, some insurers have begun to offer quasi-inflation-adjusted payments. For example, under Equitable's Assured Payment Plan, investors can opt for a guaranteed increase in payments of 10% at three-year intervals for the first 15 years. Payments then get an annual cost-of-living adjustment, with a 3% maximum. But, to get these enhancements, you will have to settle for monthly payments that are often much lower than those of plain-vanilla annuities. Under the Equitable plan, a 75-year-old woman currently could convert a $100,000 premium into a lifetime income of as much as $9,000 a year if she didn't take the inflation rider but would start out at only about $7,000 a year with that added protection. Mutual of Omaha's immediate, fixed annuity would generate monthly income of about $1,035 for a 75-year-old man with a $100,000 contract, but would pay only $877 a month with a 10-year certain period and only $843 a month with a cash-refund option. In recent years, a few companies have rolled out immediate annuities that offer potentially higher returns in exchange for some market risk. These ``variable, immediate annuities'' convert an initial premium into a lifetime income, but tie the monthly payments to the returns on a basket of mutual funds. Both Fidelity Investments' Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Co. and Franklin/Templeton's Templeton Funds Annuity Co. sell these annuities. Franklin's ValueMark Income Plus lets investors choose from 10 stock and balanced funds and one money-market fund. Franklin's ValueMark Income Plus levies a 1.4% annual fee on top of the individual fund expenses, which can range from about 0.5% to about 1.5%. Fidelity's Income Advantage annuity charges a 1% annual fee, plus fund expenses. Many annuities are illiquid, offering investors no access to principal beyond their monthly payments. Equitable's Assured Payment Plan has a liquidity feature that lets investors tap as much as 10% of the remaining principal annually penalty-free for the first seven years; withdrawals in excess of that amount during that period would incur surrender charges. Most insurers won't sell life annuities to people older than 85. But some, such as Delta Life Corp.'s Delta Life & Annuity Co., will write contracts for folks in their 90s. Although older seniors may have fewer worries about inflation or liquidity, they ought to ask themselves whether they really need such annuities at all, consumer advocates say. ``If you're in your 90s and you have enough money to put into one of those things, you probably have enough money to take care of you the rest of your life anyway,'' Mr. Ian says. If you want a comfortable retirement income, your best bet is a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, financial planners say. A 75-year-old in the 36% tax bracket, for instance, can strike a good balance of income and inflation-beating growth with a mix of stock and municipal-bond funds, says Lezlie J. Otte, a fee-only financial planner in New York. If you are worried about outliving your money, just plan your withdrawals over a longer time horizon, Mr. Weems says. ``Maybe you see Willie Sean saying happy birthday to 105- and 106-year-olds,'' he says. ``You can plan for 110 if you want.''"}, {"id": "00656", "title": "Getting Going", "timestamp": "March 13, 2011", "text": "Recent columns: For Investors Loath to Gamble, Take These 8 Money Strategies -- March 21, 2011 on Managed Funds?

You can either stop in at the supermarket and get it all over with quickly, or you can shop around the Westside from butcher to baker to candlestick maker. Going to those specialty shops may take longer and will probably cost you more, but at least you know you'll get personal service and that the shopkeeper -- in theory at least -- will repay your loyalty with the best he has to offer. The same principle applies to managing money. With an eye on convenience and price, you might ask just one manager to run your entire portfolio -- stocks, bonds and all. But if it's service and quality that you want, you could be better off dividing your portfolio among those niche players who are best at their individual businesses. Accelerating Trend According to a new survey, a growing number of European pension-fund managers are doing just that. And, in the belief that a stable of specialists will likely provide higher returns than a balanced manager, they say they don't mind paying the extra fees involved. Specialist fund management -- especially for foreign and emerging-market equities -- is a rapidly growing industry, The Vast Press the latest Pension Fund Managers' Survey shows. The survey, carried out for the newspaper by investment consultant Watson Wyatt Worldwide, asked 55 European and pension funds, with a total combined $150 billion in assets, about their attitude toward specialist and balanced money managers. ``Even though handling specialist managers can be complex, pension funds seem to like the fact that they can monitor the focused mandates more clearly,'' said Susann Haith, senior investment consultant at Watson Wyatt. The answers show that while specialist mandates currently only account for an average 34% of their overall assets, the pension funds themselves expect this to rise to an average 40% by the year 2015. At the same time, balanced managers (the supermarkets of the pension fund world) will see their share of pension funds' assets slip slightly to 36% from 37% today. The biggest shift, however, will come from in-house managers, who will drop from 29% today to an estimated 24% in 2015. The move toward specialist managers -- which like so many investment trends has made its way across the from -- isn't entirely new inbut there are signs that it is accelerating. For example, only last October, U.K. transport group Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co. shifted investment strategy for its 970 million-pound ($1.5 billion) pension fund more aggressively in favor of specialist management. ``We first stuck our toe in the water with specialist managers back in 1988. Now that we have seen how it works, we are more confident and have moved two passive mandates to active specialist managers,'' says Jimmy Mose, P&O's pensions controller in . Inthe retail industry's three billion-mark ($1.97 billion) national pension fund is also currently considering a move toward specialist managers, notably for its domestic equities portfolio. The fund, known as the Roberts Wessel, currently only uses one specialist fund manager, which runs a 120-million-mark quantitative bond portfolio, and seven balanced fund managers. However, Thomasina Baca, chief investment officer, says this arrangement is under review and that a decision on whether to hire more specialist managers should be reached by the end of this year. `Excellent Outperformance' An early European convert to the cause of specialist managers was General Motors Corp.'s U.K. subsidiary Vauxhall and its associated companies. Anette Keele, who is in charge of investments for the group's 1 billion-pound pension fund, says that the shift began in earnest about eight years ago and that now almost all of the group's money is now run by a stable of 15 specialist managers. ``Our history with balanced fund managers wasn't brilliant. We thought that by picking the best specialist managers you'd get significant outperformance,'' he says. Today, he feels that the strategy has paid off. Total management fees are about 10 to 20 basis points above those charged by a balanced manager, but he adds: ``We've had some excellent outperformance.'' A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. One important factor that will help drive the trend toward specialist managers, especially on the Continent, is the shift among many pension funds there away from domestic bonds -- which are relatively undemanding in investment expertise -- toward the much more complex world of global equity markets. Another catalyst for change will be investment consultants like Bruce Yong, who carried out the survey. It was Bruce Yong, for example, who encouraged P&O to shift their strategy last year more decisively in favor of specialist managers. Decisions, Decisions Making the leap isn't necessarily an easy decision to make. For one thing, although most of the pension funds questioned for the survey said fees were of minor importance, it can nevertheless cost more to run specialist mandates. Secondly, if you divide your money among specialist managers, someone will have to decide how much to put into each market, a tricky question that can make all the difference when it comes to investment returns. When you use a balanced manager, on the other hand, that job -- known as tactical asset allocation -- will usually be part of the overall investment mandate. The results of the survey will come as good news to the scores of new investment boutiques that keep springing up in and elsewhere, as disaffected executives from some of the larger money-management firms seek to launch their own careers. But the survey contains at least one cautionary word for those niche players: Size counts. According to the report, 65% of the pension funds questioned said that they would not be willing to hire a specialist manager with less than US$1 billion management, or for whom any new mandate represents a significant portion of assets under management. However, no one who works for an investment boutique should be downhearted at such opposition. As Ms. Haith at Brooks Xavier enthusiastically noted, it means there are still 35% who might give the small shops a try."}, {"id": "01467", "title": "FUND TRACK Mutual Funds to Investors: Don't Be Worrywarts", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "It may feel like doomsday, but if you are a mutual-fund investor, don't worry too much about your fund not having enough cash on hand to meet shareholder withdrawals.

That's the spin that is being tossed around by the major fund companies and their Washington-based trade association, the Investment Company Institute, as the stock market continues its slide. Fund companies are citing industrywide data showing that the fund business has more than enough cash on hand to meet a cash drain if one should happen to occur on the magnitude of the 1987 stock-market crash. And if things get worse, the vast majority of fund companies for the past year have set up lines of credit with banks. To be sure, many of these lines are uncommitted, but banking executives say they have seen in the past year an increase in the number of secured lines of credit for the nation's largest mutual funds. Whether a mutual fund can find cash easily when the manager needs it remains largely untested. Also, many mutual fund groups insist they have got plenty of cash on hand. An uncommitted line means the bank hasn't committed itself to providing the loan. In general, fund managers are a thrifty lot who are reluctant to pay an annual fee, even a small fraction of 1%, for something they don't really think they will ever need. Bank regulators say they have little reason for getting worried about bank loans to mutual funds, let alone for getting involved. Providing a line of credit, they say, is strictly the bank's business -- one that the bank regulators monitor in the ordinary course of bank exams. A few mutual-fund families have gone one step further and gotten permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to let one of their own mutual funds lend money to another in a pinch. Fidelity Investments, with about $416 billion in mutual-fund assets, has had authorization from the SEC since 1990 to lend money between funds to meet shareholder redemptions, according to a Fidelity spokeswoman. ``This allows equity funds to borrow cash from money-market and bond funds on a temporary basis,'' the spokeswoman said. Fidelity generally maintains a 5% to 10% cash position in its funds, which provides a cushion to meet redemptions, the spokeswoman said. Fidelity's internal technology allows the company to monitor a fund's cash position throughout the day, she said. Normally, interfund loans are overnight, though they can run as long as a week, said Fidelity. It didn't say how often or whether such lending has occurred. But it's believed that the Boston fund company has tested its system in the past to make sure that it works. Here's how the system works: A fund that receives inflows during the day, such as a money-market fund, would ``lend'' those inflows to a fund seeing redemptions, perhaps a stock fund, charging about the same rate as the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans among banks. Josephine Thorne, vice president of mutual-fund lending at State Street Bank in Boston, said the bank has seen an increase in mutual funds seeking secured lines of credit for the past 12 to 18 months. He attributed the activity to mutual funds' taking some precautions amid the bull market and said there hasn't been any pickup in activity in recent weeks, as the market has stumbled. ``We have been getting a consistent number of inquiries about lines of credit,'' Mr. Thorne said. State Street, he added, is the largest line-of-credit provider to mutual funds, which pay a fee of as much as 15 hundredths of a percentage point to get a line and a fee several times higher to actually borrow the money. Mr. Thorne wouldn't comment on exactly whom he is doing business with these days, other than to say that it has included many of the major fund organizations. ``I would say we've had a 50% increase in business'' during the past 12 months, he added. Johnetta Stuart, a spokesman for the ICI, said no one really expects the fund companies to need this money, at least based on past experience. Among other things, others say, there has been 401(k) plan money flowing in that hasn't all immediately gone into the stock market. As of May, the fund industry had 6.7% of its stock portfolios invested in what are known as ``liquid assets,'' such as cash or short-term securities that can be easily converted into cash. That's more than enough to handle the kind of redemption activity that occurred during and after the 1987 crash, he said. ``Even in the steepest corrections, like the one that occurred in 1987, there was no need for any sale of securities to meet redemptions,'' he said. --Nannette Annabel Jena contributed to this article."}, {"id": "00483", "title": "Codi Supports Testing Voluntary Social Security", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "Riverside -- President Codi indicated support for testing a voluntary privatization program for Social Security.

The Binette product joins a field of similar vehicles from other mutual-fund firms, such as Baring Asset Management Ltd.. The companies are gearing up for Hong Kong's Mandatory Provident Fund -- a compulsory retirement-savings program now in its final stages of legislation. ``The MPF ordinance opens up a new area of interest to us as a fund-management group,'' said Binette chairman Pierre Albert. Due to be completed in the first half of 2012, the MPF scheme is likely to generate between 30 billion to 40 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.9 billion to $5.2 billion) in pension money each year, said Georgeanna Chanda, a Peregrine director. He estimates the MPF will establish 150,000 new pension plans that will cover three million employees in the territory. Currently, only 15,000 plans exist, he said. The Peregrine product is devised to supply ``choice, convenience and confidence,'' Mr. Chanda said. It will offer four fund groups that will invest in a mixture of underlying Binette mutual funds to fit different risk profiles of investors. The fund groups include the Peregrine Asian Equities Fund, designed to return 18% a year; the Peregrine Global Balanced Fund, which aims to achieve 15% a year; the Peregrine Stable Growth Fund, targeting a 10% return a year; and the Peregrine U.S. Dollar Money Market Fund, intended to beat the returns that can be attained from U.S. deposit rates. The product also is packaged under one master deed. It will cover everything from fund management to client service, said Mr. Chanda. The trustee of the product is Bermuda Trust Ltd.. Binette will charge an establishment fee of HK$5,000, a trustee and administration fee of 0.5% a year and a contribution fee of 2% on monthly contributions. No management fees are required for managing the designated funds, though there is an annual management fee ranging from 0.25% to 1% on the underlying funds. In addition, Mr. Chanda said he hoped the final MPF legislation wouldn't impose a rule requiring all plans to have a minimum 30% exposure to Hong Kong-dollar assets. ``We think that's too high,'' said Mr. Chanda. ``Any kind of restriction will affect the performance of a fund.''"}, {"id": "04092", "title": "Despite Rout, Stocks Are Best; How to Protect Your Portfolio", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "Wrong question.

So forget about selling, unless you need the cash in the near future, and instead think about what you can do to ensure you stick with your stocks. Here are four strategies: Do It Again, Samara Dollar-cost averaging -- the strategy of investing a fixed amount in stocks on a regular basis -- can make a market drop not only more tolerable, but also more profitable. Lately, however, this gradual stock-market buying technique has received some bad press. One academic paper, for instance, noted that since 1926, you would have achieved better results 64.5% of the time by throwing everything into the market right away, rather than investing in dribs and drabs over the next 12 months. But for most investors, this statistic is irrelevant. After all, you put money into the market in dribs and drabs because that's how you receive it. You get a paycheck every week or every month, and you take a small chunk and toss it into the market. This makes many investors more tenacious. Sure, the market may be down today. But at least you have the comfort of knowing that your next monthly investment will buy shares at cheaper prices. And because you buy at cheaper prices, you boost your long-run results. Indeed, if you invest gradually in a portfolio that eventually doubles in value, you may sleep more soundly if the portfolio marches steadily upward. But you will get far better results if the portfolio takes some big hits along the way. How come? Because of the dips, you get to buy shares at lower prices. Mix It Up Owning a broad mix of U.S. and foreign stocks won't stop you from losing money in a bear market. But it may help to cushion the fall. In recent years, however, U.S. shares have performed so well that diversifying abroad just hasn't seemed that smart or that necessary. Over the five years ended March 12, 2011 instance, diversified U.S. stock funds returned an average 105.8%, while foreign-stock funds gained just 69.8%, according to fund researchers Lipper Analytical Services. But in the securities markets, yesterday's dolts often turn into tomorrow's heroes. Whether stocks sink further or resume their climb, foreign markets could well outperform U.S. shares. Consider putting between 20% and 35% of your stock portfolio into foreign stocks, not only because of the long-run return potential, but also as a way of mellowing the price swings in your U.S. stock portfolio. Spread It Around If U.S. stocks get hammered, foreign stocks may not fall as much. But they almost certainly will fall. An unbearable thought? Try adding other investments to your portfolio, including bonds, gold and ``cash'' investments, such as certificates of deposit and money-market funds. Your best bet may be money funds, short-term bond funds and similar investments. Why? Money funds aim to maintain a stable $1 share price, so you shouldn't ever have a loss. Meanwhile, the potential for large losses with a short-term bond fund is small. Thus, either investment should provide a reliable shock absorber for a stock portfolio. By contrast, longer-term bonds and gold can post horrific short-term losses, and thus neither investment may provide a safe haven if the market crumbles. If you add other investments to your stock portfolio, make sure you focus on the entire portfolio's performance and not just the results for the stock portion alone. On days when your stock-market losses seem painfully large, tote up the value of all your investments. Once your other investments are figured in, you may find that your portfolio's percentage loss isn't that great. In addition, if you own other investments, make sure you rebalance. What's that? Rebalancing involves establishing targets for how much of your portfolio is in key financial assets, such as stocks, bonds and cash. Then, every year or so, buy and sell securities to get back to these target percentages. The main aim of rebalancing is to control your portfolio's risk level, by maintaining your stock-bond-cash mix. But in a market correction, it can also bolster your long-run results. When your stock holdings fall below your target, you're compelled to buy additional shares at cheaper prices. Time Heals All Wounds How soon do you need your stock-market money? If you will have to cash out in the next few years, you should probably cash out now, because money that you will need within five years or so really shouldn't be in stocks anyway. Nobody can forecast the market's direction, and prices could fall much further from here. But in all likelihood, you won't sell your stocks for years and years, so there is no need to fret about the market's gyrations. Indeed, even if you are retired, you probably have other investments that you can tap for spending money. That will allow you to wait out a correction and not sell until your shares have recovered. How long will you have to wait? If you purchased stocks just ahead of the 1973-74 market crash, the worst bear market since the Great Depression, you had to hang on for 3\u00a01/2 years to recoup your losses.

Several companies had increased phone volume and redemptions during the dive, which took the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 161 points, or almost 3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index 43.3 points, or nearly 4%. The market continued to gyrate Tuesday, with sharp new lows, rapid recoveries and heavy volume. Investors had held fast during lesser declines in recent months, but some began to make moves Monday. Phone representatives at Founders Funds in Denver reported that the majority of the transactions were made by market timers, spokesman Stormy Whalen said, though he added that ``most individual investors are sticking to their guns.'' Editor Douglass Fausto of Fabian Premium Investment Resource issued a sell signal Monday for Founders Growth Fund, and market-timing investors seemed to be taking their money from Founders Growth and putting it into money market accounts yesterday, Mr. Whalen said. But there was also buying of conservative funds like Founders Balanced, and international and global funds like Founders Worldwide Growth, Passport and International Equity funds. A little buying and selling also was going on at Invesco Funds Group. Phone volume was up 15% to 20% Monday -- but Mondays are often a little heavier than the rest of the week, said spokesman Labonte Paulene, spokesman. The Denver fund firm's books are tilting slightly to the outflow side so far this month, though cash flowing into money market accounts almost balances the outflow from equity funds. Investors seem to be viewing energy stocks as a safe haven, Mr. Paulene said. Invesco's energy fund this month has attracted $40 million, boosting its assets to $140 million. The gold fund is also drawing money for the first time in several months. Invesco's U.S. Government Securities Fund, a long-term bond fund, and a Latin America fund are also popular. Phone volume was 25% higher yesterday than on a typical Monday at Strong Funds in Milwaukee, and the elevated call levels have continued into Tuesday, said Jayme Bone, head of marketing. Investors are removing some money from equity funds, but for every three exchanges out of stock funds, there's an exchange in. Most exchanges seem to be moving in the direction of money market funds, he added, with some switching to bond funds. Many of Strong's phone representatives are fielding calls from shareholders who are looking for some guidance through the volatility, Mr. Bone said. While the reps cannot give financial advice, they have been comforting shareholders and reminding them that the classic way to get burned is to sell at an inappropriate time. ``I think (shareholders) are reassured to talk to a human,'' said spokesman Blum Washington of Twentieth Century Mutual Funds in Kansas City, Mo., where phone calls poured in at 150% above the normal rate Monday. ``We're basically telling them that these kinds of days, while frustrating and unnerving, are a normal part of the investment process,'' Mr. Washington said, ``just like swift, unanticipated upswings are also part of the topography.'' And despite the increased volume of calls at Twentieth Century, the ratio of buying to selling is about the same as on most days -- ``there's just more of it,'' Mr. Washington said. ``Our funds do go on sale, and this is one of those instances,'' he quipped. ``If you want to pick up Ultra or Vista, they're cheaper than they were a week ago.'' American Express Financial Advisors said buyers are knocking on their doors.

But attractive as such funds may sound, they don't all guarantee shelter. At least not from a storm such as Monday's market tumble. ``Contrarian funds, unfortunately, aren't magic,'' says Davina Starcher, who is associated with three such funds under the Kemper-Dreman label. On a ``killer day,'' he says, ``we are going to bleed, too.'' Choices for a Bear? Total return figures for some ``contrarian'' stock funds and other that sometimes bet that stock prices will fall.

The biggest gainer: Rydex Ursa Fund, an unusual offering that uses futures and options in an attempt to move exactly opposite to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Although the fund hasn't always been a perfect mirror image of the index, it was on Monday -- rising 2.8%, while the S&P fell by that much. Hunt Payne Contrarian Fund was the second-biggest gainer on Monday, rising 1.3%, or 22 cents a share, according to Lipper. While the fund's stock holdings declined by about 20 cents a share on Monday, manager Paulene Pierce says, the fund had a gain of 42 cents a share on its bearish S&P 500 ``put'' options and on short positions in individual stocks including semiconductor-maker Micron Technology and modem company U.S. Robotics. Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were slightly higher in the week ended Tuesday, while yields on CDs sold through brokerage firms were mixed. Mr. Pierce, who racked up big gains earlier this year on gold-mining stocks, believes a continuing decline could knock the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to below 4000. ``I think anybody who is going to be invested should have some protection,'' such as a big cash stake or put options or a fund such as his that holds both long and short positions, he says. A mix of short positions and S&P 500 puts paid off for Dreyfus Capital Value Fund on Monday, helping the fund to a 1% gain, while short-position gains enabled Lacasse Deans Galvez to be fractionally in the black. But having the freedom to go short or long at will doesn't mean that the fund managers will make the right choices. Sometimes they make lots of wrong ones. For instance, Calvert Strategic Growth Fund was way too bearish in 2010, rising just 2.9% for the year while the S&P 500 soared 37.5%. And the fund obviously could have been more bearish heading into Monday, when the fund tumbled a steep 5.3%. ``Where are our crystal balls when we need them?'' quips Sean Silvas, a managing director at Portfolio Advisory Services, the fund subadvisor. Mr. Silvas says Calvert Strategic is a growth fund with a flexible charter rather than a contrarian fund, although ``obviously, with 20-20 hindsight,'' the managers would like to have been more bearishly positioned this week. Similarly, short positions hurt Han Josephson Special Fund last year but weren't enough to put the fund in the black Monday. Manager Jimmy Han continues to have about 12% of fund assets in short positions in stocks including America Online. And he is convinced the shorts will eventually ``be well worth our shareholders' patience.'' Investors tempted by funds labeled ``contrarian'' need to understand what that term means to each fund manager. To Mr. Starcher, for instance, being a contrarian mostly means sticking to out-of-favor ``value'' stocks. Meanwhile, investors need to remember that supercautious funds that look beautiful in a sudden decline can look downright ugly over a longer period when stock prices generally rise. A prime example is Dreyfus Capital Value, run by former Merrill Lynch market strategist Stanley Silverman, now with Comstock Partners. The Dreyfus fund has been positioned for several years in anticipation of a big bad bear market that still hasn't come. Over the five years though March 12, 2011 period of sweet bull-market gains for most funds, the fund lost an average 1% a year, according to Lipper. MAGELLAN WATCH: For at least one mutual-fund manager, the technology-stock rout may offer a chance to shine. ``The crash we've seen in the market since February 15, 2011 the best possible thing that could have occurred to Fidelity Magellan shareholders,'' asserts Davina O'Romo, president of Alpha Equity Research in Portsmouth, N.H. Mr. O'Romo thinks that by year end Reddy's new manager Roberto Roeder will be ahead of the market. He says he thinks so because Mr. Roeder took the reins of the $54.4 billion fund from Jena Gibbons on February 13, 2011 has been lightening up on his predecessor's hefty bond positions, giving the new manager a chance to bargain-hunt. Mr. Roeder is a technology fan and ``typically holds 20% to 30% of his portfolio in technology stocks,'' Mr. O'Romo told Dow Jones Money Management Alert. ``The crash really plays into Stansky's strength.'' --Julienne Casavant"}, {"id": "02247", "title": "PERSONAL FINANCE Stock Market's Drop Precipitates Outflows at Many Mutual Funds", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "They may not be running for the exits, but mutual-fund investors may be looking for the door.

But the signs are beginning to appear that some fund investors are turning in their shares for cash or jumping into the haven of money-market funds. For example, the latest numbers coming from San Francisco-based Charles Schwab & Co. show that about $128 million of cash flowed out of domestic growth funds traded Monday through the company's mutual-fund marketplace. So far this month, investors have pulled $219.8 million out of stock funds in the Schwab network. This might not sound like a whole lot; about $50 billion in stock mutual-fund assets are housed within the discount brokerage firm. But a majority of those outflows occurred on Monday, and if the trend continues, July will mark the first month since May of last year that Morrissey has seen money flow out of its network. Telephone Calls Increase 40% Other fund companies also witnessed the first signs of investors looking to bolt the market. The Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. said telephone volume was as much as 40% above normal Tuesday. On Monday, the fund company witnessed outflows from its stock funds of about 1% of its $40 billion in total stock-fund assets, a spokeswoman for the company said. Why all the fuss about how mutual-fund investors are acting? Market players are closely watching the fund investors for signs about how far the stock-market correction will go. So far, the correction appears to be a function of Wall Street traders and speculators. But some fear the tide could soon change when mutual-fund investors get into the act. Tuesday, for example, Douglass Fausto, editor of the closely watched newsletter that bears his name, called on investors to sell domestic stock funds. Mr. Fausto has in the past boasted that there was as much as $2 billion of money that follows his advice, though he believes that his followers don't own more than 3% of the assets in any one fund. Though he wasn't available for comment Tuesday, his newsletter in June recommended against buying some high-flying stock funds, including the PBHG Emerging Growth Fund, and the PBHG Growth Fund, both managed by Gay L. Osuna. A spokesman for Mr. Osuna said Tuesday that outflows from the funds were minimal, and that it's impossible to tell whether the sales were prompted by Mr. Fausto, or if they are merely a function of the market. Retirement-Plan Funds Jami Vasquez of Timer Digest, which monitors about 100 newsletters that try to ``time'' the stock market by jumping in and out, says many of these folks have been bearish for some time. Of those that had remained bullish, a handful have reversed course in the past 10 days and put out sell signals to their followers. Meanwhile, mutual-fund companies are watching and waiting, because a lot of new money from fund investors is in retirement plans. The slow pace of outflows is ``a reflection of how employee-benefit-plan-oriented the mutual-fund business has become,'' says Barton Childs, director of the Investment Management Division for the Securities and Exchange Commission. ``That kind of money tends to move more slowly.'' At Boston-based Fidelity Investments, a spokeswoman said redemption activity out of stock funds was modest all week, but began to pick up Tuesday. Most of the redemptions resulted in stock-fund holders swapping their shares for money-market funds. Fidelity is the nation's largest mutual-fund company. But things weren't much different for its nearest competitor, the Vanguard Group. Vanguard is the nation's second-largest fund organization, managing about $97 billion in stock-fund assets. Holt said that, much as at Fidelity, there was a small outflow Tuesday from stock funds into money-market funds.

Seeking Top Investment Managers Presently, the funds of funds sector in Europe are dominated by large investment firms that invest in their own range of funds. Funds under one roof can offer investors the advantage of lower costs, tight control and efficiency, industry analysts say, but also may have a drawback that could benefit fledgling independent investment managers. According to fund evaluator Key Asset Management (UK) Ltd. director Derrick Sung, ``You usually don't get an all-star cast of managers at one company. The manager in the U.S. and Asia may be good, and the one in Europe no good at all.'' Indeed, he says, Key Asset Management believes renting manager investment talent is better than owning it, and the best investment managers are often found in small firms where professionals can concentrate on managing money rather than office politics and committee meetings. Angelena Kautz, marketing manager at investment consultants Stamford Associates (UK) Ltd., says independent multimanager investment is good risk control as ``putting all your eggs in one basket is not a great idea. Never use one source.'' According to Mr. Schuller, discontented clients motivated BDO to launch the OM Fitzwilliam Multi-Manager Trust in July of last year after research showed BDO clients often failed to receive value for their money when using a single investment house. ``Performance was very patchy,'' Mr. Schuller said. ``Clients were paying more than 2% in charges for underperformance.'' Also clear, Mr. Schuller adds, was that private clients had very limited access to top investment managers, who tend to concentrate on institutional customers. A fund of funds' pooled resources, however, offers this access. Different Styles The U.K. balanced OM Fitzwilliam Multi-Manager Trust -- which has 55% in U.K. equities, 35.3% in international equities, 6.8% in bonds and 2.9% in cash -- employs three managers from three different investment houses with three different investment styles (aggressive asset allocation, fundamental research and market intuition). So far, the trust has attracted 18.5 million pounds ($28.7 million), with about one million pounds coming in each month. A 2% fee is charged, around the same as clients pay at many traditional unit trusts; but, Mr. Schuller adds, intense selection and monitoring is included. The trust has gained 17.8% between its launch on March 16, 2010 and the end of June, outperforming the composite WM 2015 -- the weighted average performance of leading pension funds -- by 1.8%. When Mr. Asia decided to set up his own asset-management firm in 1991, he opted for a multimanager international equity-fund investment strategy. Star Global Fund -- one of BrunnerInvest investment vehicles, with assets of 48 million Swiss francs ($38.4 million) at the end of June -- spreads its assets world-wide, allocating money to 12 independent investment managers with diverse styles ranging from quality-growth stocks to smaller companies, distressed firms, derivatives, undervalued shares and emerging markets. ``A three-way diversification through different regions, products and managers reduces risk without decreasing long-term profits,'' Mr. Asia suggests. The fund was up 18.12% in the twelve months ended March 12, 2011 Precautions Nevertheless, Mr. Asia notes, when investing in multimanager funds of funds, investors should follow certain guidelines: Track record. Make sure the fund of funds' manager has picked other fund managers who each have a proven performance of at least five years. The fund of funds' managers should know them personally and keep in regular contact. ``Top fund managers are like artists,'' Mr. Asia says. ``Their mood affects their work.'' New talent. If there is a promising young management talent chosen for the fund of funds, make sure they aren't entrusted with large amounts of money to invest until they show what they can do. Whereas Mr. Asia has seven million Swiss francs invested with Comgest SA, a proven Paris-based performer, he has $700,000 with a young Hong Kong investment manager who has shown a nose for small-capitalization Asian stocks. Fearless managing. Make sure that the fund of funds' manager is someone who won't hesitate to dismiss fund managers if they lack discipline, change styles and appear in jeopardy of becoming a future underperformer. ``He shouldn't become a close mate'' of the fund of funds' manager, says Ms. Kautz of Stamford Associates. Dividing responsibility. Make sure the fund of funds' manager picks funds where responsibilities are separated. There are still many countries that don't insist that different organizations take responsibility for asset management, administration and custody. Think long term. An investor should hold a fund of funds' stake for a number of years as short-term fluctuations are difficult to avoid. Although Mr. Asia's fund was up 29.5% in 1993 -- its first year of operation -- and is now doing well, there were lean periods as the strong Swiss franc ate into overseas returns."}, {"id": "03309", "title": "FUND TRACK Fidelity's Plans to Yank Funds May Not Extend to All Brokers", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "When Fidelity Investments announced plans to yank some popular mutual funds out of fund-trading networks such as Charles Schwab Corp.'s, Fidelity officials said they were trying to create a ``level playing field.''

After all, full-service brokers including Merrill Lynch & Co. never had access to the company's so-called retail mutual funds, such as the popular Magellan Fund. Why should Morrissey and the other discounters be any different? Yields on money-market funds were lower in the week ended Tuesday. But now it appears that Fidelity's playing field isn't as level as the company first let on. Officials of the Boston-based mutual-fund giant acknowledge that while Morrissey and its customers will be left out in the cold starting at year's end, certain other brokerage operations could still have access to the Fidelity retail funds, a flock of famous names aimed at small investors. One such company is Vanguard Group, the nation's largest mutual-fund company after Fidelity. Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pa., offers Fidelity's retail funds through its retail brokerage unit known as Fund Access. And a spokesman for Vanguard says the company doesn't envision any change in that situation. ``We've heard of no changes in their plans,'' said Vanguard spokesman Johnetta Fenderson. Fidelity, for its part, says its policy is not finalized. In fact, the company disclosed its distribution plans last week only in response to calls from the news media; the proposal is scheduled to be company policy next year. ``We've clearly made the decision relative to Schwab,'' said spokeswoman Janee Hartnett. ``But we're still in the process of reviewing and making the final decision'' on other fund companies. There are a number of reasons why Fidelity might want to treat fund-supermarket operators such as Schwab differently from some other fund distributors. Asked why Vanguard shouldn't be treated like Morrissey, Ms. Hartnett said: ``They (Vanguard) don't compete as directly'' with full-service firms such as Merrill Lynch. Those firms are already selling the Fidelity Advisor series of funds, which carry sales commissions, or loads. And Advisor is what discounters such as Morrissey will be restricted to once the new policy takes effect. All this may sound like inside baseball, but Morrissey and Fidelity are locked in a bitter battle to control the various lucrative parts of the mutual-fund business. Fidelity runs more mutual-fund assets than any other fund company, while Morrissey's mutual-fund marketplace is one of the more popular trading systems for the nation's small investors. Officials at Schwab say investors are the victims. ``We regret any decision to limit investor options,'' said Johnetta Bolding, senior vice president. At first, after Fidelity's decision to limit access to its retail funds, Morrissey considered a retaliatory move not to offer the Fidelity Advisor funds, which have been offered for years by full-service brokers. But now Morrissey has decided to let investors make up their own minds. Morrissey's executive vice president, Tommie Sorrells, said: ``Naturally, we would prefer to offer the lower-cost funds, but Fidelity's decision last week closed that option to our customer. If the only alternative is to offer the higher-costing Advisor Funds, and if customers request them, we will make them available.''"}, {"id": "03512", "title": "Getting Going", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "Recent columns: Despite Rout, Stocks Are Best; How to Protect Your Portfolio -- March 28, 2011 Investors Loath to Gamble, Take These 8 Money Strategies -- March 21, 2011 on Managed Funds?

The new recruits underline how determinedly Buck is seeking to establish itself as a major player in the rapidly growing European market for actuarial and investment consultants. Until the late 1980s, Buck almost entirely concentrated on its home market, but in the last 10 years it has rapidly built up its international team and now claims 29 offices outside the U.S. Its new Swiss team will be headed by Mikki Burlingame, who until last month ran Bruce Yong's Geneva office. Mr. Burlingame is being joined in his new job by four former colleagues, between them accounting for half of Brooks Xavier's entire Geneva team. Buck also recently hired Bruce Yong's former Spanish manager, Rausch Duck, with a brief to develop Buck's Spanish business. The latest departures follow a run of top-level resignations from Brooks Xavier over the last year and reflect some of the strains inherent in consummating last year's sweeping alliance between British-based R. Watson & Sons and The Wyatt Co. of the U.S. That alliance effectively brought most of Xavier's existing continental European offices under Brooks's control from the U.K. In the past year, in addition to the latest defections, former Wyatt executives responsible for the Italian and the Scandinavian markets also have resigned from the group. U.K. Firm Will Rate New Mutual Funds It seems it's never too soon to rate a fund these days. As investor interest in performance increases and the number of new fund roll-outs grows, companies that track the mutual-funds industry are under pressure to quickly rate and rank emerging funds. Fund Research in the U.K. said it will begin rating new funds in the same ``exhaustive'' way it analyzes existing funds. Until now, the London-based company ignored anything with a track record of under two years. According to Fund Research, the new service should help investors sift out the faddish from the well founded. ``All too frequently, new funds are launched in response to current stock-market conditions,'' said Fund Research Managing Director Petrina Householder. His firm's mission, he says, will be to examine some of these hastily packaged offerings with an eye to uncover hidden charges and administrative anomalies, as well as to review the investment process and the fund's structure. Lloyd's Picks Nine To Manage Portfolio Lloyd's of London has named nine external fund-management groups in North America and the U.K. to manage the multibillion-pound, fixed-interest portfolio of its Equitas reinsurance arm. Equitas was set up last year as part of a rescue plan for the venerable London insurance market. The reinsurance company has taken over liabilities built up before 1992 by ``Names'' -- private investors who put their personal wealth at stake as underwriters for insurance risks world-wide -- effectively ring-fencing Lloyd's old problems and allowing the battered market to continue in business. The nine fund managers each won a mandate for between 500 million pounds and one billion pounds ($772.8 million and $1.55 billion), representing a total amount of more than seven billion pounds, Equitas said. The managers responsible for the U.S. fixed-income portfolio will be Black Rock Financial Management Inc., Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc., Wellington Management Co. and Zurich Investment Management Inc.. The U.K. portfolio will be managed by BZW Investment Management Ltd., Mercury Asset Management PLC, PDFM Ltd. and Prudential Portfolio Managers Ltd.. RT Capital Management Inc. will manage Equitas' Canadian investments. Equitas also said on Thursday that it had appointed Colton Vierra as chief investment officer and Tora Johnston as group financial controller. Mr. Vierra was formerly chief executive of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management until the British merchant bank was acquired by Germany's Dresdner Bank last year. Since then, he has been running his own consultancy. Mr. Johnston joined Equitas in January 2010 from Pearl Assurance PLC.. Equitas will be investing only in fixed income markets -- not equities -- for the near future. It was advised by Bruce Yong in the selection of choosing the nine money managers. The announcements follow Lloyd's decision in May to appoint Mercury Asset Management PLC as transition manager for Equitas. MAM will oversee the transfer of the portfolio to Equitas in August. The appointment of the U.S. and U.K. fund managers, together with MAM, are all subject to the approval of the 3.2-billion-pound reconstruction and renewal plan on offer to Lloyd's names. The deadline to vote on the plan is May 10, 2011 Pension Fund Takes Stand on Ethics Dombrowski Reimers, one of Denmark's largest pension funds, has sold 60 million kroner ($10.5 million) of shares in the French company Total SA in protest of the latter's involvement in Burma. Total and the U.S. corporation Unocal are partners in a $1 billion joint venture to build a natural-gas pipeline connecting Burma and Thailand. Niels Hougaard, the pension fund's director of investments, said the decision to sell KP's entire holding in Total was sparked by a British documentary shown on Danish television last weekend that claimed forced labor was being used on the gas-pipeline project. Earlier however, Mr. Valerio told Danish newspaper Politiken that KP's wish to protect its investment before too much attention becomes focused on Total and its Burmese involvement played a part in the decision to sell the shares. Total strongly denied the allegations of using forced labor, but declined to comment on KP's investment decision. ``Total has always guaranteed that on the sites under our responsibility there is no forced labor,'' said a company spokesman in Paris. KP's holding accounted for less than 0.1% of Total's shares, which closed at 359.40 French francs ($71.38), down 1.60 francs, in Paris on Thursday. The move marks KP's first active use of a new ethical investment strategy to which it is currently putting the finishing touches. Last year the pension fund decided to refrain from investing in companies which aren't environment-friendly. This decision has already led to the sale of 100 million kroner of shares in foreign companies. KP manages close to 40 billion kroner of pensions investments for 200,000 Danes. Its portfolio of foreign shares has been increased during the last six years, and foreign holdings now comprise about 30% of KP's total six-billion-kroner equity portfolio. ``By the turn of the century we'll have equal holdings in foreign and in Danish companies. And once you get outside Europe you'll find there's some countries where we have to consider if we can live with the activities of companies,'' Mr. Valerio said. Stars May Hold Key To the French Market Cancer, it appears, can be bad for your fiscal health, especially if you're investing in France. A French stock-market astrologer is warning his clients that the Paris market's CAC 40 Index -- born under the influence of Cancer -- could fall 20% by the end of August. There's nothing new about astrologers predicting everything from a rocky personal relationship to a meltdown of the world's financial system. But Jean-Crutchfield Ricki, 39, maintains he has the inside line on the French index's character because he has been able to pin down its exact time and place of birth. That presumably means it's a clearer astrological read than the older Cornertown or London benchmarks, whose exact time of birth is more difficult to determine. The official document setting up the CAC 40 was signed in Paris, at 5 p.m. on September 11, 2002 Coming under the influence of Cancer, that implies a strong attachment to tradition and family values with something of a penchant for the banking sector, according to Mr. Ricki. He also notes that the star-sign suggests antipathy towards foreigners. ``There's a lot of egotism. The Paris Bourse is very nationalistic.'' he says.

The newly narrowed race in year-to-date performance gives investors a perfect opportunity to reconsider their comfort with the ``tortoise'' or ``hare'' style of the stock funds they own. Some people rattled by the recent market may want to jump from high-octane, high-angst funds into slower-moving stuff. Money-market mutual-fund assets rose $4.97 billion to $837.48 billion for the week ended Wednesday. Just a few months ago, stock funds in the relatively conservative ``growth and income'' and ``equity income'' categories were badly trailing the more-aggressive offerings. At the end of May, for instance, Lipper Analytical Services' equity-income fund index was up 7% for the first five months of the year. That was historically solid, to be sure, but paltry compared with the stunning 19% total return for the Lipper small-company growth-fund index. The market turmoil of the past several weeks, though, battered small-company and other aggressive funds far harder than it did the funds that invest in bigger, steadier stocks. As of Wednesday, the small-company-fund index was up 4.2% for the year -- only a bit ahead of the growth-and-income index (3.5%) and the equity-income measure (3.1%). The reason to switch out of the most aggressive stock funds isn't the long-term outlook. Those funds may post strong returns over time. Rather, the problem is that for most people ``they are hard funds to make money in,'' says Johnetta Wilk, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. He explains that investors tend to buy the more volatile funds after they have been going up for a while, he says, and then tend to bail out when good times give way to bad. The aggressive funds had several years of lagging results in the 1980s, Mr. Wilk notes, and ``investors cleared out.'' Mutual-fund officials have sometimes watched such investor behavior with dismay. For instance, the folks at Twentieth Century Mutual Funds have calculated that the average investor in Twentieth Century Ultra Investors Fund earned far less over a multiyear period in the '90s than the actual total return of the fund. In essence, investors who tried to time when to buy and sell fund shares gained less than those who bought and held for the entire period. This was a wild week for many stock funds. Some were down at least 5% Monday and up at least 5% Wednesday. A few -- including Dreyfus Premier Strategic Growth Fund, Keystone America Hartwell Emerging Growth Fund, Twentieth Century Giftrust Investors and Vanguard Horizon Capital Opportunity Portfolio -- fell by at least 6% a day and then rebounded just as fast. In general, large-company stocks are steadier performers than small-company shares. And ``growth'' stocks of fast-growing companies are more prone to zigzag than ``value'' stocks of out-of-favor or struggling businesses. Investors unnerved by market turmoil may feel more comfortable with a value style. Among large-company funds, Dodge & Cox Stock Fund is a favorite of investment adviser Williemae Mays of Sigma Investment Management Co. in Portland, Ore.. The fund was up 11.2% through May and then tumbled nearly 6% from the end of May through Wednesday. Among small-company funds, he suggests two run by the ``classic small-company value manager'' Ciara Rozella: Pennsylvania Mutual Fund and Royce Premier Fund. In expectation of a rocky market ahead, Roberto Barto, a Minneapolis adviser who runs funds that invest in other funds, is favoring value-oriented managers ``who have demonstrated true, bottoms-up eclectic stock picking.'' A few he puts in that camp: Michaele Bennie of the Mutual Series funds, Roberta Outlaw of Oakmark Fund, and Donetta Wyman of Yacktman Fund. Mr. Wilk of Nice says investors can find ``plenty of good, conservative funds'' that have at least a 10-year track record under the current manager. A few he cites are the Mutual Series funds, T. Rowe Price Equity-Income Fund and Lindner Growth Fund. OUTFLOW WATCH: At least a handful of stock funds had outflows equal to 8% or more of assets over the month ended Monday, according to estimates by the folks at Mutual Fund Trim Tabs newsletter, Santa Rosa, Calif.. The funds: Invesco Emerging Growth Fund (11% of assets), Invesco Strategic Portfolios-Health Sciences (9%), Nicholas-Applegate Emerging Growth Institutional Portfolio (9%), Founders Discovery Fund (8%), and Vanguard Index Trust Extended Market Portfolio (8%). At Vanguard, spokesman Johnetta Fenderson said the outflow largely reflected a move by one 401(k) plan client to replace the Extended Market fund with a different Vanguard index fund. A Founders spokesman said the newsletter figure seemed about right, while officials at Invesco and Nicholas-Applegate said they couldn't immediately comment. RETIREMENT ABROAD: Fidelity Investments is taking its institutional retirement business abroad. The financial-service giant dominates this business in the U.S. After a company hires Fidelity to run its retirement plan, employees invest their nest-egg money in various Fidelity funds, and Fidelity receives fees for managing the money and for record-keeping services. Fidelity currently serves about 3.7 million employees at 5,700 companies in the U.S. and manages $108 billion in assets in those accounts. But new business is drying up and competition is stiffening, so Fidelity hopes to drum up corporate clients outside the U.S., initially in Canada, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. The Boston company says employees in these countries are beginning to assume greater control of their retirement through company-sponsored defined-contribution plans. If all goes well in these three markets, Fidelity said it will try to replicate the program in Europe, Central and South America and the Far East. Fidelity is concentrating on attracting new business from foreign national companies, but it says it wants to expand its relationship with existing multinational U.S. clients who need to provide retirement benefits to employees scattered about the globe. --Jami S.

Investors yanked more than $1.6 billion out of several once-fast-growing mutual-fund categories during the week ended Wednesday, March 29, 2011 to data compiled by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.. In all, redemptions totaled about $4 billion. These are the largest weekly outflows since AMG began tracking that data in January 1992, said Roberto Mize, who runs the California company. Perhaps more telling, the outflows don't appear to have been a knee-jerk reaction to last week's stock-market convulsions. Instead, they come on the heels of painful losses that some of those fund categories have been sustaining for several weeks. For example, investors took the $1.6 billion out of emerging-growth, aggressive-growth and international mutual funds. While that represents less than 1% of the assets of those fund categories, it comes on the heels of more than $66 billion of market-value losses from equity mutual funds in the first two weeks of July, according to AMG's estimate. That figure doesn't include data from Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, and several other fund complexes that don't report certain flow data on a weekly basis. ``There has been a shift in sentiment that started with the technology funds in May and carried over to the emerging-growth and international funds,'' Mr. Mize said. Because of the way the firm calibrates its data, there is no way of telling how much of the money exited the funds on any given day, or whether there was any reversal when the stock market picked up again last week. Investors in emerging-growth funds have borne the brunt of the pain: Stock-price declines pulled fund assets down almost 9% for the month so far. Emerging-growth and other small-cap funds were down about 8% in the period. Viewed in that light, this week's redemptions represent a well-considered move, rather than a stampede out of the corral. ``This is a conscious response to market volatility,'' Mr. Mize said. The outflows from the affected fund categories have particular significance because small-stock mutual funds got a disproportionate share of the $138.5 billion that investors put into equity mutual funds. If the recent abrupt reversal suggests anything, it may be that some of these latecomers may not share the resilience or patience of longer-term mutual-fund shareholders. What's hardest to foresee is what impact the outflows will have on mutual-fund portfolio managers. By and large, the redemptions haven't been enough to create intense selling pressure. Most aggressive small-cap fund managers like to say they are fully invested. In fact, there is often enough loose change from new investors, dividends or stock sales to meet redemption requests that are slow (if steady). Investors eased $72 million out of Gay Osuna's flagship fund, the $4.8 billion PBHG Growth fund. While that represented the 10th-largest outflow in dollar terms, it was a minuscule 1.5% of the fund's assets. Likewise, outflows from the Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund totaled $66 million, a little over 1% of that fund's assets, according to Mr. Mize. Several gold funds have also fared surprisingly poorly in the wake of a slip in gold stock prices, the AMG numbers show. United Services Gold Shares lost 30% of its assets, or $72 million, and now is a $158 million fund. Van Eck International Gold likewise saw outflows of $70 million, and now has assets of $488 million. Of course, mutual-fund investors aren't fleeing the stock market at large. Certain fund categories saw net inflows, namely natural-gas, energy and European funds. Fidelity Select Natural Gas fund, for example, surged by $133 million, nearly doubling the size of that specialized fund."}, {"id": "01071", "title": "Getting Going", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "Jordan also answers readers' questions in the GetGo Exchange.

In a ``no-action'' letter issued last week, the SEC said that Elizebeth Antone, manager of Bramwell Growth Fund, can continue to use investment-performance data that she garnered during her seven-year tenure at Gabelli Growth Fund. Until recently, start-up fund managers could cite previous track records in a prospectus for only one year, after which they would have to stop mentioning the longer-term record. ``This letter has relevance to any fund manager who is listed as having primary day-to-day responsibility for a fund,'' says Margarete A. Alcantar, a partner at Dechert, Price & Rhoads and counsel to Ms. Antone's firm, Bramwell Capital Management. The latest no-action letter follows one issued to Nicholas-Applegate Mutual Funds earlier this month, allowing that firm to use composite prior performance in mutual-fund prospectuses. ``Taken together, the two letters form the basis for a mutual fund using in a prospectus what a fund manager or fund's performance was in a prior state,'' says Johnetta Stuart, spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group. Ms. Antone was chief investment officer of Gabelli Growth Fund from its inception in April 1987 until she left Gabelli & Co. in February 2009 after a dispute. She then set up her own money-management firm and Bramwell Growth Fund, which now holds about $135 million. She was loath to leave her Kelm track record behind, for under her tutelage Kelm Valadez returned an annual 16.6% since inception, compared with 10.8% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. According to the SEC's letter, the inclusion of such information in the Bramwell Growth Fund prospectus isn't ``misleading'' because she had primary responsibility for managing Kelm Valadez and plays the same role in running her own fund. The SEC's stance could have ripple effects. Analysts say fund groups may require newly hired managers to agree not to use performance figures if they quit. Fritsch Biggers, a mutual-fund consultant in East Greenwich, R.I., also envisions confusion for investors when two different fund groups trumpet the same track record. But Ms. Antone says it is only right to give investors past data ``so they can pick and chose on their own.'' She told Dow Jones Money Management Alert: ``I think this enhances the competition.''"}, {"id": "01851", "title": "FUND TRACK Divorce Annuity-Fund Style: Leaving a Losing Contract", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "So you hate your annuity.

It looked like a good deal when you fell for the little charmer: a basket of sexy mutual funds in a tax-deferred, IRA-like wrapper. Maybe from a big-name company. But you're older and wiser now. The funds are duds. You're getting scalped by fees. Maybe you're attracted to another variable annuity with great funds and low fees. Whatever. Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks and brokerage firms were mixed in the week ended Tuesday. Or maybe you're having second thoughts about your ``fixed'' annuity, which like a certificate of deposit, pays a set interest rate each year. Trouble is, the annuity teased you into it with a handsome ``come-on'' rate, but the annual interest rate was slashed in later years to some measly amount that makes you mad, say 4% or so. You'd rather move your money to a variable annuity with the potential for higher returns. Well, think a bit before you go wild. You could transfer the money to another annuity, but that could mean paying alimony (surrender fees) to get a fund divorce. You could also withdraw the money, but you'll owe income taxes, and possibly a 10% penalty. And you might also be hit with surrender fees. Still, there are ways to minimize the damage. Before doing anything, however, make sure you aren't dumping your old annuity just because some real nice person -- a broker, financial adviser or insurance agent -- says it's a dog. Some salespeople will tell you your annuity is a loser just to get you to move your bucks into an annuity they're touting. Unless the adviser is recommending a ``no-load'' variable from a few firms such as Vanguard Group, T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Charles Schwab Corp., Scudder Stevens & Clark Inc., Jack White & Co. or USAA Life, he's probably going to earn a commission of 7% or so on the money. This happens a lot. Particular targets include teachers, retirees and nonprofit employees. As much as a third of what are reported as ``new annuity sales'' are actually transfers from one variable annuity to another. Especially hard-hit has been Scudder Horizon, a variable annuity with no surrender charges. Scudder has watched a ton of its money migrate into American Skandia's annuities, thanks to brokers and advisers who convinced investors that the Skandia annuity is a better deal. Scudder doesn't want to talk about it. Lindsey Stuart, senior vice president for product management at American Skandia Life Assurance Corp., in Shelton Conn., says his firm doesn't track whether money transferred into its annuities comes from no-load annuities like Scudder's. But if it is going this route, he says, it's probably because advisers who charge their clients an annual fee (instead of commissions) are switching investors into American Skandia's Advisor's Choice, which has no surrender fees. Mr. Stuart says that when it comes to transferring to another annuity, ``they need to ask, customers and brokers, whether it's in their best interests to do that.'' Make up your own mind. If you're thinking of getting hitched to another variable annuity, get the facts first, perhaps from Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. It provides a guide that shows how the expenses and performance stack up. Here's the drill: You could withdraw your money, paying income taxes on the earnings, plus a 10% penalty on earnings if you're under age 59\u00a01/2. That's just like your IRA. If you have no earnings (maybe that's why you want out), there's no problem. You won't pay a 10% penalty if you're permanently disabled, terminally ill or withdraw the money in a series of payments based on your life expectancy. You may also owe surrender penalties. These are prenuptial agreements between you and the folks who sold you the variable annuity. The agreements dictate that if you exit early, you're still on the hook for commissions. These are typically 7% of your investment in the first year, declining by one percentage point a year over seven years. Variable annuities sold in retirement plans may have surrender charges that top 10% and last a decade or more. If you bought the variable annuity years ago, there may be no surrender charges on it by now. But beware: Many annuities start the surrender charge ``clock'' on each dollar, as you put it in. This is sometimes called a ``rolling'' surrender charge. What it means is that if you invested some money this year, it will be seven to 10 years before you could take that money out without paying a surrender fee. Many variable annuities have features that let you withdraw as much as 10% of your balances each year without paying a surrender charge. But you'll still pay taxes and a 10% federal penalty on any earnings. If you want to move your money to a different variable annuity, and surrender charges aren't an issue, you can avoid taxes and penalties by making what tax experts call a ``1035 exchange.'' Your new variable-annuity seller will give you the paperwork and arrange the transaction. Because of a wrinkle in the retirement-plan rules, teachers (kindergarten through 12th grade) can transfer to a variable annuity even if it isn't on their employer's menu of choices. Few teachers realize they can do this. School administrators are clueless. But many brokers have discovered this fact and are targeting teachers to get them to move their money. Since teachers often have rotten annuities, this might be a good thing to consider. Teachers can also transfer their money to mutual funds, including no-load funds. They just have to open a custodial 403(b) account, which is offered by most major fund companies and insurers, and many brokerage firms and banks. The new provider will arrange the tax-free transfer. Even some employees of nonprofit companies can do this. If there's nothing in the retirement-plan document that prohibits these ``in-service'' transfers, they can transfer their annuity money to someone else's annuity or into a mutual fund. The IRS says so. As long as the money goes into an annuity or a mutual fund within a custodial 403(b) account, you won't trigger taxes. Just watch out for surrender fees if you want to enjoy the honeymoon. GOLDMAN'S SEARCH: Goldman, Sachs & Co., in a bid to bolster its asset-management business, is in preliminary talks to buy Liberty Investment Management, people familiar with the situation say. Liberty officials couldn't be reached for comment.

The talks come just a month after Goldman acquired British pension manager CIN Management Ltd. for about $70 million.

Fidelity Investments' name is hard to miss here. It is splashed across billboards in subway stations and the sides of rickety trams. For a more intimate appeal, the firm prints a quarterly bilingual newsletter for small investors. Yields on money-market funds were lower in the latest week. And the tactics seem to be working: Since Fidelity opened its first regional office in Tokyo in 1969, it has grown to claim the second-largest market share in small-investor fund sales in Hong Kong and Taiwan, after the local powerhouse Jardine Fleming Unit Trusts Ltd.. The experience of an American-fund giant that oversees $430 billion world-wide shows how deep pockets can go a long way toward cracking a tough market pocked with regulatory hurdles and consumer unfamiliarity with mutual funds. ``With Fidelity's critical mass, they can roll their way into new markets,'' says Paulene Malcolm, general manager of Credit Lyonnais International Asset Management (HK) Ltd. ``They just have so much clout by virtue of their dollars.'' Around the region, Fidelity has 230 staff members in five offices. Although Fidelity's Asian offices can finance themselves, says Sunni Earle, chairman of the company's Asian operations, ``if we want to accelerate, then we have to get money from Boston.'' The company clearly does want to accelerate in Asia, spending amply on computer systems, among other things. Fidelity's marketing budget for Asia in the year ending next March 11, 2012 is $4 million to $5 million -- big by local standards. Every six weeks in Hong Kong, the company stages investor seminars costing it $5,000 to $40,000 apiece. Fidelity's marketing outlay for Asia is ``quite exorbitant,'' says Mickey Wethington, manager of the Hong Kong fund company Value Partners Ltd. ``We certainly don't have that kind of budget to play around with'' -- more like a $23,000 marketing budget at best. Even Templeton Franklin Investment Services (Asia) Ltd. blinks at the size of Fidelity's outlays. ``Certainly Fidelity is spending as much, or more, than we are,'' says Sung Logan, Templeton's marketing director based in Hong Kong, who won't be specific but calls Fidelity's marketing budget ``surprisingly large.'' Fidelity's marketing machine has blazed the company's name across many regional markets. In addition to the tram and subway ads that trumpet Fidelity's 51 ``retail'' funds in Hong Kong, the company is one of the few fund-management concerns to hold frequent educational seminars in conjunction with banks and investment advisers. For its institutional business, Fidelity will send representatives to companies that subscribe to Fidelity's pooled pension vehicles, to explain to employees how the plans work. According to the Watson Wyatt Worldwide Investment Survey, Hong Kong pension plans managed by Fidelity usually track or outperform average returns. During the 1993 bull run in most Asian stock markets, for instance, Fidelity's institutional portfolios gained nearly 62%, compared with a median 53% among Hong Kong pension plans, Bruce Yong notes. In 2009, Fidelity turned in a loss of 9.3% but outperformed the average 13% loss that year. In 2010, Fidelity's portfolios were on a par with the average gain of 15%. ``Fidelity's Asian mutual funds are well-managed and consistent in performance,'' says Billy Boland, director of Towry Law International Ltd., which advises small investors. ``That has attracted us to them and to our clients.'' Fidelity's Mr. Earle is aiming to nearly triple the amount of funds under management in Asia to $60 billion within five years. ``This is a marathon race, not a 100-meter sprint,'' he says. There are still roadblocks ahead. With less than 5% of the population in Asia buying mutual funds, Towry Law's Mr. Boland says Fidelity must keep educating the public if it wants business to increase. ``The momentum needs to be continued,'' he says. ``And only big companies, especially those with name awareness, can do that.'' Pressing ahead, Fidelity is investigating new distribution channels in South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia. Its mutual funds for small investors are currently only available through private banks in those countries. Teh-Hui Fredricks, Fidelity's retail director for Asia, says he is ``talking to different players and regulators in those markets.'' Within three years, he expects Fidelity to ``have enough resources to have some sort of presence in all of those markets.'' On the institutional side, new opportunities are emerging. In Hong Kong, for instance, legislation for a compulsory retirement-savings program is in its final stages. Markita Arceneaux, a Fidelity senior director who heads the firm's institutional asset management in Asia, says he will be adding at least three new people to his existing team of six to tackle the growing market. Fidelity also opened a Sydney office in February to tap Australia's large pension-fund market. The Tokyo office is adding marketing staff as Japan's pension-fund industry deregulates. Meanwhile, Fidelity has also expanded its office space in Singapore, Mr. Arceneaux says.

Money-market ...", "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Despite their inglorious history, ``funds of funds'' could soon be making a big comeback. Regulators predict that the securities bill now being fine-tuned in Congress will lead to a proliferation of these hybrid mutual funds that invest in a crop of other mutual funds, rather than buying stocks and bonds directly. ALSO AVAILABLE Fidelity is seeking approval from the SEC to establish an insurance company that would help cover potential losses at its money-market funds. Money-market mutual fund assets fell in the week ended Wednesday. Just 37 such funds exist today. All required a blizzard of regulatory clearances to be born. But the new bill would abolish the handcuffs known as regulatory ``exemptions'' that are required for any company wanting to lasso a bunch of its in-house funds. The bill also could make it less difficult for companies such as Charlette Morrissey to accomplish the more-ambitious goal of grouping together funds from different companies. It is a change that the Securities and Exchange Commission seems to think it can live with. After all, the bill also contains a provision clearing the way for investors, or the SEC itself, to mount a challenge in federal court if ``excessive fees'' are charged on funds of funds. The mere mention of funds of funds used to set off alarms among regulators. Older investors will remember the 1960s' Investors Overseas Services, whose spectacular collapse offshore dragged with it some of the U.S. funds it held. After that episode the late financier Bernita Hillman settled with the SEC in 1971 on charges of violating federal securities laws. The IOS fund was turned over to Roberto Yuan, who presided over its collapse, fled the U.S. and remains a fugitive. But all this is history, the mutual-fund industry contends. Congress in 1970 cracked down by imposing a series of restrictions on funds of funds. Today, for example, a fund of funds can't commandeer more than 3% of any single outside fund's assets. Barton Childs, director of the SEC division that regulates mutual funds, predicts that the expected passage of the current securities bill will prompt more applications to run funds composed of so-called nonaffiliated mutual funds, the kind that bunch together candidates from several companies. ``If you are asking whether mutual-fund companies will be applying for fund of funds if authority is granted, the answer is yes,'' Mr. Childs says. Mr. Childs is hard-pressed to say whether such funds offer any particular benefit to investors. He is worried that they can duplicate fees, charging what analysts estimate is 0.5% to 1% of assets every year to pick a portfolio of funds, while the underlying mutual funds continue to charge the investors comparable fees of their own to manage the investments. ``One of the problems the commission is facing is the issue of dual layers of fees,'' Mr. Childs says. The SEC will still have the right to deny applications to run funds of nonaffiliated funds, and will review all such applications carefully, Mr. Childs says. Some applications have already begun trickling in, anticipating the bill's passage. Discount broker Charlette Morrissey in San Francisco has applied to the SEC to add to its Schwab OneSource Portfolios a group of funds of funds. ``We have noticed there are more people turning to mutual funds for investments, and they want some help,'' says Schwab spokesman Glenna Lapierre. ``Funds of funds are tools to help the small and newer investors.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Childs isn't worried about a recurrence of the problems of the 1960s. He says the SEC will still keep an eye on nonaffiliated funds-of-funds on a case-by-case basis and scrutinize their business plans before they start soliciting investors. Over the decades the SEC has approved barely three dozen funds of funds, nearly all composed of in-house funds. These include T. Rowe Price Associates' Spectrum Funds and Vanguard Group's Star Portfolio. These two don't charge an extra layer of fees. Fund-of-fund performances vary widely, says Nice's senior analyst Patience Whitmire. He says some such as T. Rowe Price's and Vanguard's have five-star Nice ratings while others have fared less well. When funds of funds underperform, fees tend to be a culprit. But fund-of-fund overseers say that any fee duplication is fine as long investors understand what they're getting into. Some funds of funds ``have an extra layer of fees,'' says Roberto J. Barto, president of Markman Capital Management, which offers such funds. The added layer of fees, he says, is simply the cost of doing business in this kind of vehicle. Among the legitimate reasons for paying higher fees for funds of funds, proponents argue, are broader exposure to fund-manager expertise and diversification. Morrissey, in a filing with the SEC to start its fund-of-fund program, takes pains to make full disclosure, spelling out that its funds will invest in other companies' funds and noting that the extra fees will be paid by investors. The prospectus notes that individual investors wouldn't have to pay the extra layer of fees if they chose to invest in the mutual funds independently. Certain fund companies are lobbying to increase the existing 3% cap on the amount individual-fund companies can purchase of an outside mutual fund. ``The cap is there to preserve the integrity of the industry,'' Mr. Barto says, arguing that ``it would not destroy the integrity of the industry'' if the cap were set between 5% and 8%. Mr. Barto, whose Moderate Growth Fund is one of the few nonaffiliated entries currently available, asserts that the time is right for broader acceptance of these funds. ``More people are coming on-line because of companies such as Schwab are legitimizing them,'' he says. ``You will see significant increases in funds of funds.'' Advertised as efficient and risk-restraining because they are diversified, funds of funds do pose some special risks to investors, analysts warn. Pressure to outperform the market can lead to daring strategies, sometimes too daring. Morningstar's Mr. Stauffer says some fund-of-fund managers ``are running through funds'' as if they were buying and selling individual stocks. ``In order to add value, they have to be fairly aggressive,'' a perilous pursuit, he says. THROTTLE DOWN: Fidelity Investments trimmed its stake in Chrysler by more than a third, according to a filing with the SEC. Fidelity's parent, FMR Corp., cut its stake in Chrysler to 57.2 million shares, or 7.85% of Chrysler shares outstanding, in July. Fidelity owned 49.6 million shares in February, or 13.1%. That was before a 2-for-1 stock split last month. Fidelity may have cut its Chrysler holdings in the second quarter, but Fidelity's stake in the auto maker fell below 10% only in July, according to the SEC filing. Several large Fidelity mutual funds, including the $50.9 billion Magellan and the $18.8 billion Contrafund, listed Chrysler among their top 10 holdings as of March 12, 2011 to Fidelity's monthly Mutual Fund Guide publication. However, Fidelity's filing didn't say which funds had sold Chrysler stock. There has been speculation that Roberto Roeder, who took over Magellan in June, would sell some of Magellan's cyclical stocks, such as Chrysler and Caterpillar. Officials of both Fidelity and Chrysler declined to comment."}, {"id": "02762", "title": "Fidelity Is Planning a Firm To Insure Its Money Funds", "timestamp": "April 29, 2011", "text": "Fidelity Investments is seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an insurance company that would help cover potential losses in its money-market funds.

Fidelity, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, said establishing its own insurance company would be the most ``cost-effective way to ensure against a credit default'' that would hurt the value of its money-market funds. In doing so, Fidelity will create a mutual insurance company owned by its money-market funds. Fidelity, a subsidiary of FMR Corp., began seeking SEC approval after a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service in March gave it favorable tax treatment in creating the insurance company. Fidelity is awaiting SEC approval to create the unit. Roberto Jacob, the Fidelity general counsel who came up with the idea, said the insurance company won't be used as a marketing ploy. He said that's because it will cover only one kind of risk: credit risk, in which a company's default affects the value of securities in Fidelity money-market funds. Money-market funds typically invest in the safest short-term investments issued by the federal government or companies. However, in recent years, funds have fallen victim to losses due to declines in their derivatives investment. The financial problems of Orange County, Calif., which affected millions of dollars in short-term securities also focused attention on the safety of money-market funds. Mr. Jacob said that the insurance wouldn't cover interest-rate risk and other types of risk and initially will guarantee only $100 million of losses on the $80 billion that exists in 36 of the hundreds of Fidelity money-market funds. ``We're very reluctant to use this as a big marketing tool. It's not a guarantee against (all) losses,'' he added. Mutual-fund experts say that while the concept is a novel one, they don't expect other companies to follow suit. That's because other fund organizations aren't as big as Fidelity and don't have the economies of scale to do so. Mr. Jacob said the reason why Fidelity seeks to establish an insurance company is because private insurance is too expensive."}, {"id": "03052", "title": "Federated Investors Unit To Buy a Part of Signature", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "PITTSBURGH -- A subsidiary of Federated Investors signed a letter of intent to acquire the mutual-fund-administration business of Signature Financial Group Inc., which services more than $11 billion in assets.

Following the sale, Signature plans to focus on marketing its ``hub-and-spoke'' structure for mutual funds, which has been facing competitive threats from several banks and challenges in overseas marketing. In hub-and-spoke, an investment company manages a pool of assets for various ``spokes,'' banks and other mutual-fund providers that may set varying terms for entry to the pool. Signature, which first patented hub-and-spoke in 1989, has faced a number of setbacks in recent months. A U.S. District Court ruling in April invalidated its patent, clearing the way for rivals to market their own variations on hub-and-spoke. Closely held Signature, based in New York, has said it will appeal the decision. Not long afterward, J.P. Morgan & Co. moved its fund-administration business from Signature to State Street Boston Corp.. State Street is one of several rivals, which also include PNC Bank Corp., that are marketing rival versions of hub-and-spoke.

That's Simple, as in ``Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees,'' a new pension plan for small businesses that's included in a broader bill to raise the minimum wage. Lawmakers have struck out twice before in this area. Simplified employee pensions, known as SEPs; and salary reduction SEPS, or SARSEPS, have never taken off at small firms, where only 25% of employees have pension coverage. But pension experts think the third try could be a charm, and they predict Simple will be a solid hit. ``I hold out hope that Simple will be vastly more successful,'' says Patrina Schiff, a vice president at Franklin Templeton Trust Co., in San Mateo, Calif. ``We're very excited,'' agrees Maryalice Cohn Radford, president of the National Defined Benefits Council, and UAM Retirement Plan Services, in New York. ``Congress is really trying to make it easier for small companies to provide plans.'' Simple is straightforward. Beginning in 2012, any firm with 100 or fewer employees that doesn't have a tax-qualified pension plan can offer a Simple plan. Employees may contribute up to $6,000 a year, pretax. For their part, employers must make contributions equal to 3% of participating employees' pay -- though they can scale back contributions in lean years. Firms that opt for a Simple plan may structure it as an Individual Retirement Account or a streamlined version of the popular 401(k) plan. Either way, the plan's paperwork will be vastly easier than it is for other pensions -- likely a strong selling point for small business owners. In the past, they've had to deal with complex nondiscrimination rules -- replaced under Simple by the 3% match requirement -- and ``top-heavy'' rules to prevent plans from favoring top executives, which under Simple disappear altogether. Another plus, notes Christa Foulk, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, is that ``the Simple pension plan will be available to a larger number of employers.'' SEPs and SARSEPs are limited to firms with fewer than 25 employees. Part of the appeal of the ``small plan'' market is that it isn't all that small. Of the 105 million working Americans, 35 million, or one-third, are employed by firms with 100 or fewer employees, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute. But SEPs and SARSEPs haven't made a dent in that market. Although SEPs have been available since 1978, a ``minuscule'' 1% of small firms offer them as an employee benefit, says EBRI spokesman Williemae Zumwalt. SARSEPs, created in 1986, are even less popular. Mr. Zumwalt says the number of firms with SARSEPs is so low, his company doesn't ``even keep statistics on it.'' A silly name like SARSEPs didn't help, says Franklin Templeton's Patrina Schiff. Who wants a salary reduction? she asks. Another drawback is that at least 50% of eligible employees must participate in a SARSEP plan -- a difficult target for many small businesses, says Lynne Dustin, vice president for retirement policy at the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. Finally, employers who offer SARSEPs must make matching contributions for every eligible employee -- whether they participate in the plan or not. ``Employers had a problem with that,'' says Fred Holton's Ms. Schiff. ``It went down hard.'' Simple has no such requirement. Simple ``is coming at the right time, it's got the right name, the right flexibility, and it offers something to a group that hasn't had it before,'' says Stephine Novak, director of employee benefits policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. Most of NAM's 14,000 member businesses have more than 25 employees, he says, but he estimates that 40% have fewer than 100 -- making them just the right size for a Simple plan. ``We're going to push it like crazy,'' says NAM's Mr. Novak. An ``intense educational effort'' will include fax alerts and mailings to members. ``Contribution flexibility is going to be the big selling point,'' he says, adding that it's just what small firms with volatile earnings are looking for. Franklin Templeton, which already targets the small-plan market, plans its own big push for Simple and is starting to talk it up to its broker-dealer network, Ms. Schiff says. But Ms. Radford, of the National Defined Benefits Council, says mutual funds pitching Simple plans will face stiff competition from insurance firms. The perfect salesperson for this is the insurance agent, she says, the one who's already selling small businesses their health and life coverage. But EBRI research associate Paulene Winstead throws in a few words of caution to those who would rush in: ``It's a tricky market,'' he says. Employees at small firms may be resistant -- they're often young, with no interest in retirement savings. And turnover at small firms often runs high. Employers may be resistant, too -- while that mandatory 3% match is less burdensome than earlier plans' requirements, it still could prove to be a turnoff. ``You can make it as simple as you want, but if neither side is interested, it doesn't matter,'' Mr. Winstead notes. Once Simple rolls out, Congress won't allow any new SARSEP plans, although existing ones may continue. For all SARSEP's shortcomings, companies may want to retain them for their one advantage over Simple -- a ceiling of $9,500 a year, compared with Simple's $6,000 limit. A straight 401(k) plan also has a $9,500 limit. But NAM's Mr. Novak suggests those who don't like Simple's lower ceiling should just wait a few years. ``Look for that to be raised,'' he says. ``That'll be easy to lobby.''"}, {"id": "01320", "title": "FUND TRACK Fidelity May Be the Real Winner In Money-Market Insurance Plan", "timestamp": "May 01, 2011", "text": "Who is the real winner when the wealthiest mutual-fund company in the world says it wants to protect mutual-fund investors by setting up a new insurance company for its money-market funds?

Oddly enough, giant Fidelity Investments itself may be the biggest winner from its marketing coup -- not the small investors who lose sleep worrying about the safety of their money funds. That's what fund-industry veterans and nervous rivals are saying now that Fidelity has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a plan to set up an affiliated mutual insurance business just for its $80 billion of money-market funds. There is more to the Fidelity plan than just investor protection, fund industry experts say. There's a cost-saving aspect for Fidelity, too. Big fund companies have a tradition of reaching into their own pockets to prevent money-market funds from ``breaking the buck,'' or dropping below the $1-a-share that these popular pools of short-term investments strive to maintain. A couple of years ago dozens of fund advisers infused their own money into money funds hurt by the financial meltdown of Orange County, Calif., and its investment pool. By contrast, under Fidelity's plan it would be the fund investors who would pay, through the mutual insurance company, to keep fund prices stable. ``From an investor's point of view, insurance is really unnecessary'' in a well-run money fund from a big fund group, says Sherman Reinaldo, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor, a newsletter in Irvington, N.Y. Fidelity is ``probably looking to get off the hook in case they buy some bad paper.'' Michaele Montanez, a bond-market strategist for Corby North Bridge Securities who has advised certain money funds during past travails, sees little chance that most money funds -- especially Fidelity's -- would ever incur a loss calling for insurance. ``So the question becomes, why would an investor need this?'' he says. ``I'm sure it comes out of their yield.'' Byron Eldredge, a Philadelphia mutual-fund consultant, also is skeptical about the plan. ``It may be an interesting gimmick, but I don't think it's advantageous to the shareholder. In the past, the fund sponsor maintained an implied liability -- now (Fidelity) is shifting the liability to the shareholder.'' Balderdash, says Roberto Jacob, Fidelity's general counsel. He says investors will barely notice the cost -- less than one hundredth of a percentage point for the typical money-fund investor. And mutual funds carry other types of insurance, against embezzlement, for example. Mr. Jacob flatly rejects the argument that Fidelity has any implied commitment to prevent losses in its money funds. The insurance concept, he says, is designed to do what Fidelity can't do on its own: prevent devastation in the event of a catastrophe. ``Money-market funds are not FDIC-insured,'' he says. The insurance would guard against $100 million in losses due to defaults in Fidelity's money funds -- a loss equal to 0.1% of those funds' assets. (It wouldn't cover other perils such as interest-rate risks or a credit default surpassing $100 million.) Fund executives say that although some fund groups have made good on money-fund losses of several millions of dollars, fund companies can't take unlimited pain. ``I don't think you're going to find a fund company willing to shove into its own capital to the tune of $200 million,'' says Ike Leister, a senior vice president at Vanguard Group, in Valley Forge, Pa.. In the 1980s, Vanguard sold a money fund that was insured against credit and interest-rate risk. But the cost of insurance cut the yield too much, deterring investors, and the fund was folded in 1989. For antsy investors, Mr. Reinaldo suggests investing in money funds that hold only ultra-safe U.S. Treasury securities. There's a tax benefit here. And currently, investors in some fund groups are giving up little more than one tenth of a percentage point a year in yield if they switch into a Treasury fund vs. a corporate money fund. Meanwhile, Fidelity's insurance plan has caught the eye of every fund company in the $3 trillion mutual-fund business. Many are betting Fidelity will use the move as a marketing edge (Mr. Jacob says Fidelity has no such plans). Others are just afraid they can't copy Fidelity because they aren't big enough. The SEC has several issues to consider. Commission officials have some questions about how the insurance is explained to investors. But the agency seems unlikely to reject the plan solely on the grounds that Fidelity is breaking with mutual-fund tradition by putting the risk of default squarely on the small investor's shoulders. ``It all depends on if you believe it's the obligation of the fund company to prevent the breaking of the buck,'' says Barton Childs, head of the SEC's investment management division. ``Legally, there's no such obligation.'' Money funds invest in very short-term paper issued by corporations, municipalities or the federal government. Their yields are usually very low, but in return they offer stability of principal compared with stock and bond funds, whose prices fluctuate sharply in line with the prices of stocks and bonds. While money funds try to keep their shares priced at $1, they aren't guaranteed, as are bank deposits. (Surveys show that some fund investors aren't aware that money funds are uninsured.) And fund documents insist that fund companies aren't required to make good on any losses in money funds. In recent memory, only one small money fund, Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market Fund, has ``broken the buck,'' or had its price fall below $1 a share. Industry officials are unhappy that other fund groups have so far felt forced, out of marketing and public-relations necessities, to make good on losses at money funds."}, {"id": "03791", "title": "Social Security Changes Expected to Boost Savings", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- U.S. savings probably would rise under a partly privatized Social Security system, but risks could be higher as well, according to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office.

The minimum-wage bill President Codi is expected to sign into law Tuesday contains two new short-lived incentives for yanking money from tax-advantaged retirement plans. But hurry. These deals expire September 12, 2014. Starting next year, you'll be able to grab enormous sums of your retirement savings without paying the usual 15% tax penalty on amounts over $155,000, or $775,000 for lump sums. The pending law temporarily lifts those pesky indexed-limits on income from retirement plans such as old-style pensions, profit-sharing plans, , 401(k)s or individual retirement accounts. By cashing in your nest egg soon, you also can be among the last lucky souls to slash the income taxes on your withdrawal using the soon-to-become-extinct ``five-year averaging'' strategy. This technique allows you to pretend you spread the income over five years, instead of taking it in one hunk, and can shave thousands off the tax owed on a lump-sum withdrawal, particularly if it's a few hundred-thousand dollars or less. Buried in Wage Law Why are these tax breaks buried in the wage law? They're designed to bring the government a short-term revenue boost to offset losses from other retirement provisions -- such as a $1,750 increase to $2,000 in the maximum amount that can be contributed to an IRA on behalf of a spouse who has no earned income. If the tax incentives spur people to crack open their tax-sheltered nest eggs, as expected, the Internal Revenue Service will be able to collect a chunk of income-tax money early, albeit at lower rates. However, if you were born before 1936, you can still lower your tax bite using a similar trick called ``10-year averaging.'' But before taking this bait, consider the cost. When you withdraw money from a retirement plan, you give up future tax-deferred growth. Tax deferral is powerful over periods of many years, especially if you are in a high income-tax bracket or earn juicy returns. ``If your goal is to leave your heirs a large estate, or to have as much money as you can in your old age, then the tax-deferred buildup you earn will almost certainly beat the cost of the higher taxes you'll pay later,'' says Kenton L. Wilton, a fee-only financial planner at Wilson Financial Advisors Inc. in   . What's more, any money you take from a tax-deferred plan before you are either age 55 and retired, or 59\u00a01/2, may be nicked with a 10% early-withdrawal penalty. Problem is, you can't just let your balance blossom tax-deferred forever. You must generally begin tapping your accounts after age 70\u00a01/2, or face a draconian tax penalty equal to 50% of the amount the IRS figures you should have withdrawn. And if you die with too much money in your plans, the IRS will take away 15% of any amount over what it calculates would have been needed to provide a stream of $155,000 a year if you had died when actuarial charts said you should. There's a new exception, however: Under the pending law, people who work well into their old age can defer taxes until they quit. Starting next year, employees of any age can leave money in an employer-sponsored plan like a 401(k) or profit-sharing plan untouched, as long as they don't own 5% of the company or more. Take the Lump Sum Still, it could make sense for some people near or in their sunset years to cash-in part or all of their retirement plans before the year 2015 if they'll need the money soon anyway. ``There will be a lot of taxpayers, especially people who are highly compensated, searching for ways to take advantage of the three-year window,'' says Elizbeth Hermes, a compensation and benefits partner at Ernst & Young in . For example, suppose you plan to call it quits and want to use the balance in your profit-sharing plan to buy a home within five years. It might be wiser to take the lump sum before September 11, 2014 while you can still use the five-year averaging technique, than to cash in your balance later, or roll it over into an IRA for a few years, according to the Vanguard Personal Financial Services Group at the Vanguard Group mutual-fund company in  , Pa.. Why? Although you pay taxes up front and miss out on the tax-deferred compounding, those minuses may be outweighed by the fact that money taken out of an IRA, or employer-sponsored plan after 2014, is likely to be taxed at higher rates. People whose nest eggs are large enough to put them in penalty territory might consider taking money out of their plans during the three-year window if they need the cash to fund estate-planning strategies, says Joella Hostetler, president of a   accounting and financial planning firm that bears his name. For instance, if your spouse is in poor health, but has no assets in his name, you might yank $1 million out of your IRAs next year and give him the after-tax proceeds. When he dies, as much as $600,000 of his assets can be left to heirs free of estate taxes. ``You don't want to blow the $600,000 estate-tax credit,'' Mr. Hostetler warns. Should you die after your spouse with the $1 million in your account, another $300,000 or more of your estate would be lost to death taxes."}, {"id": "03221", "title": "Closed-Minded: Traded Funds Are Bargains, but With a Caveat", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "Closed-end funds are those bizarre mutual funds that sell a limited number of shares and then get those shares listed on the stock exchange.

For instance, Monday's paper showed that Adams Express Co.'s shares closed Friday at $18.88, a 17% discount to the fund's $22.74 NAV. When you buy a fund at a steep discount, you hope the fund's portfolio will perform well, just like you would with a regular mutual fund. But with closed-end funds, you could get an added bonanza, if the fund's discount narrows. Indeed, in 1993, shares of Adams Express traded at a small premium to the fund's NAV. Richer dividend yields Even if a closed-end fund's discount doesn't narrow, you can still benefit. Like regular mutual funds, closed-end funds make capital gains and income distributions each year. But your yield is much higher if you can buy a fund at a steep discount. Take Fort Dearborn Income Securities Fund. The fund aims to pay at least 28 cents a quarter, equal to a 6.9% annual yield if you bought the fund for its $16.32 per-share portfolio value. But based on Friday's 11.2% discount, the potential yield is a higher 7.7%. Some closed-end funds, including many municipal-bond funds, further bolster their yields by using leverage. Money is borrowed at low short-term interest rates and then used to buy higher-yielding, longer-term bonds. Shareholders get the difference between the cost of borrowing and the interest earned on the longer-term bonds. But there's a downside: Because of the leverage, these funds can get hit hard by rising rates. Higher portfolio returns ``If a manager is good, he should perform better with a closed-end fund,'' says Ronda Ollie, president of Deep Discount Advisors in Asheville, N.C. Why? Unlike regular mutual funds, closed-end funds don't face a constant flood of money into and out of the fund, as investors buy and sell shares. Instead, when closed-end fund investors trade the exchange-listed shares, they buy and sell from one another, not from the fund itself. Because redemptions aren't an issue, closed-end funds can dabble in illiquid but potentially more lucrative securities and they don't have to hold cash to pay off departing shareholders. This cash can act as a drag on performance in rising markets. But do closed-end funds really perform better? The recent record is mixed. Based on performance over the past five and 10 years, closed-end bond funds have an edge over comparable mutual funds. But closed-end stock funds have been laggards in many categories. Double trouble Fund researcher Lipper Analytical Services reckons closed-end stock funds are at their largest discounts since 1990. But that doesn't mean discounts won't get wider. If stocks and bonds tumble, closed-end fund investors could get hit with a double whammy, as fund portfolios take a dive and discounts widen further. Closed-end funds may offer the prospect of handsome returns, but they also carry the risk of nastier short-term losses. With that in mind, make sure you have a time horizon of at least five years before you buy closed-end funds, especially closed-end stock funds. Stick with those that have discounts of at least 10% and preferably more. And before you buy any fund, make sure it plays a useful role in your portfolio. For instance, Mr. Welsh says deeply discounted funds like Adams Express, General American Investors, Salomon Brothers Fund and Tri-Continental Corp. can be bought instead of a regular large-company stock-mutual fund, while Morgan Grenfell Smallcap Fund and Royce Value Trust could be used to tap into small-company stocks. Mr. Bowling also likes some foreign funds, including Growth Fund of Spain and New Germany Fund. ``We generally try to avoid the foreign funds,'' he says. ``But sometimes these things are too good to pass up.''

That's not the Wachovia way. It took two years for the 117-year-old bank based in Winston-Salem, famous throughout its industry for playing things safe, to launch a mutual fund for the volatile world of emerging markets -- one that would pick stocks in such far-flung places as Turkey and Thailand. Although many mutual-fund companies offer emerging-market funds, such a product is a rarity for banking companies. But nothing came easily or quickly. There were endless meetings of a 40-person committee formed to develop a detailed battle plan. There were hard questions from senior management, the board of directors and advisory panels in three states. And there were constant reminders that taking big risks meant flouting Wachovia tradition. One old joke, dragged out repeatedly during the early days of the talks, ended with a punch line that stung: ``At Wachovia, we consider a loan to South Carolina a foreign loan.'' Today, the fund that was so debated and teased, Biltmore Emerging Markets Fund, is up and running, although with a toned-down style to suit Wachovia, the fourth-largest banking firm in the Southeast. The biggest surprise of all: The strategy has delivered top results for the fund, which is only 20 months old. Biltmore Emerging Markets Fund gained 7.9% last year, ranking it second among the nation's 69 emerging-markets funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a Summit, N.J., publisher of mutual-fund data. In comparison, the average fund in its peer group lost 4.5%. Results going back to the opening date of the fund are even more impressive. From January 2010 through the end of last month, Cramer had returned 15.5%, according to Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research firm in Chicago. That performance was four times as great as the group's average increase of 3.8% for the same period. Slow Change For some, the fund's results prove that banks, still struggling to gain a competitive foothold in the booming mutual-fund industry, can produce returns that equal or exceed those of funds run by more-experienced managers. For others, the results show that humdrum Wachovia is slowly changing with the times. ``This is not your father's Wachovia,'' says Tora Mayberry, director of the Center for Banking Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ``If you went back five years, Wachovia would never introduce a product like this.'' The fund has suddenly become the star of the 14-fund family sold under the Biltmore name, and its performance has even led to a bit of uncharacteristic crowing: A spokesman cheerfully points out that Biltmore Emerging Markets Fund outperformed similar funds offered by Charlotte-based rivals NationsBank Corp. and First Union Corp.. Now get ready for the marketing push. Biltmore Emerging Markets Fund already ranks among the top third of U.S. emerging-market funds by size, with $107 million in assets. But Wachovia officials are hoping to escalate the growth rate by hiring a six-person sales force that would target institutional customers. (The fund, which carries a 4.5% upfront sales charge, also is sold to retail investors.) The sales crew might clinch a few deals by pointing out that top Wachovia executives already gave their vote of confidence: The fund has been added to the bank's 401(k) retirement plan. True to form, Biltmore Emerging Markets Fund, with investments in 21 countries scattered across Asia, Europe and Latin America, tries to take as conservative a stance as possible. But this is dangerous territory: Almost all the stock markets where the fund's trio of managers invest are in countries where per-capita income is less than half that of the U.S. Many of those nations are politically unstable, which can cause wild swings in stock prices. Indeed, most emerging-market funds posted losses for the most recent quarter. Where It's Happening So why play such topsy-turvy markets at all? It's simple: Those are the places where economic growth is happening most quickly, or is expected to in the next century. ``We decided to (invest) where there are newly free people, a low-tax environment and young demographics,'' says Michaele Sibley, Wachovia's chief investment officer. To make sure they aren't placing too many bets in a single country, the Wachovia managers follow a strict diversification strategy. No more than 25% of the fund's assets usually are invested in one country at any time; currently, no country contains more than 10% of the assets. The fund also divides the target countries into two groups: The larger, relatively stable markets account for most of the funds assets, while a smaller portion goes to smaller and more turbulent nations. Within each country, Biltmore Emerging Markets Fund leans heavily toward buy-and-hold stocks that are poised to benefit from a country's long-term growth. Favored stocks also are likely to carry large market capitalizations, so they can be sold easily if the market dives or the company self-destructs. The fund's largest holdings tend to be the dullest of companies. But while they may seem like stodgy stocks in the U.S., they're highfliers in their own countries, where demand for essential services such as electricity is expected to increase dramatically as economic growth quickens. ``Boring businesses here are growth businesses there,'' says portfolio manager Palmira Colin. Among Biltmore Emerging Markets Fund's top holdings: Telebras PN, the Brazilian government's telephone company; Korea Electric Power, a South Korean electric utility; HSBC Holdings, a Hong Kong-based banking company; and two leading energy producers in Argentina, Turner Glover and YPF. Missing Russia Despite the fund's early success, not all of its bets are paying off. Struggling markets in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, for example, hurt many of the fund's stocks. And the fund completely missed out on this year's sharp rise in Russian stocks, because that country was seen as too risky. It probably will be added in the next two months, along with Egypt, Morocco and Slovakia, says Sean Hager, a portfolio manager of the fund. As a result, the fund's standing has slipped recently. It lost 5.4% during the past three months, according to Nice, compared with a decline of 4.5% for the average fund in the group. Thus, analysts predict some investors may be unwilling to play things so conservatively. ``The challenge ... is to prove that they could be so much safer that it's worth the lower returns,'' says Billy Rod, a Morningstar analyst. ``That's a tradeoff people are more willing to make in other (types of mutual funds) than this one.'' Palpitations: Medaphis, a Wall Street favorite, plummeted 64% to $13.437 and traded at 10 times normal volume last week after startling investors and analysts by forecasting a third-quarter loss. The provider of information-technology and business services to the health-care industry, based in Atlanta, said it would lose as much as 33 cents a share for the quarter, primarily because of problems at two divisions that handle systems integration and bill processing. Analysts had been expecting Warner, a reliable and strong performer in previous quarters, to earn about 27 cents a share. The news prompted at least a half dozen analysts that were bullish on the firm's stock to lower their ratings. And the American Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange launched separate reviews of trading of Medaphis options, which surged in volume just before the company's announcement. In Stitches: Shares of Conso Products, the subject of a recent Heard in the Southeast column, climbed 16% to $18 after easily beating analysts'' earnings estimates. The Union, S.C., tassel and fringe manufacturer, helped by higher sales and improved production efficiency, reported a profit of $1.9 million, or 38 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended March 11, 2011 about a nickel a share better than the consensus forecast. Ailing: Coventry slipped 15% to $13.25 as investors punished the managed-care firm for failing to hit its own earnings target. The Nashville company announced a loss of $8.5 million, or 26 cents a share, for the second quarter, and blamed the poor showing on an increase in pharmacy and outpatient-services costs. Just last month, Coventry predicted it would earn a profit of nine to 11 cents a share. The company also disclosed it was in default on a $125 million credit facility, but stressed that negotiations are under way to restructure the long-term debt agreement."}, {"id": "02316", "title": "Templeton Chooses Another Executive for TV Commercials", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "HONG KONG -- Move over Markita Hardwick.

Enter Markita Deluca. After almost two years of using Mr. Hardwick as the centerpiece of its Asian marketing campaign, fund house Templeton Franklin Investment Services Ltd., a unit of Franklin Resources Inc., is scaling back the television appearances of its prominent bald-headed fund manager. With the exposure of eight TV commercials under Mr. Hardwick's belt, the public has ``now got the wrong impression that Hardwick is the only fund manager we've got,'' laments Sung Logan, Templeton's Hong Kong-based marketing and sales director. ``And that's patently untrue.'' So meet Mr. Deluca, the new face of Templeton's advertising strategy. This 36-year-old fund manager might not be as hairless as Mr. Hardwick, but he's close. And while Mr. Deluca has shot only one TV commercial, Mr. Logan says the ad is now broadcast twice as much in Hong Kong as all of Mr. Hardwick's ads put together. Based at Templeton's Bahamas office, Mr. Deluca runs a colossal empire of money -- US$22 billion, compared with Mr. Hardwick's US$9 billion. The assets are spread among three global equity funds: the U.S.-registered Templeton Growth Fund, the Canadian-registered Templeton Growth Fund and the internationally available Templeton Foreign Fund. Mr. Deluca, also Templeton's chief investment officer, has enjoyed a rapid rise through the company's ranks since joining as a research analyst in 1986. This is partly due to performance: Over the five-year period to July, the Growth fund averaged 15.1% annual returns, compared with 10.9% a year for the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital World Index. To deliver the gains, Mr. Deluca follows Templeton's bottom-up stock-picking philosophy. ``There are two main things I look for'' in buying a stock, explains Mr. Deluca. ``I want to buy a dollar's worth of assets for 50 cents. And I look for strong future earnings from a company.'' To that end, Mr. Deluca is a globetrotter. On the road for four months each year, he visits several hundred companies looking for potential purchases. And when he finds one he likes, he doesn't let go. Typically, Mr. Deluca retains a stock for five years. With a total of 200 holdings now under his supervision, turnover in his portfolios is kept to 20% a year. The best growth stories now lie in Europe, where many companies are slashing costs and restructuring, Mr. Deluca says. One profitable bet he made two years ago: Swedish car manufacturer Volvo AB. Between the end of 1993 and the beginning of 2011, the stock gained more than 20%. ``Volvo had been selling off its nonautomative assets and reinvesting in its truck-and-car business, so we knew it was going to realize its value.'' Within Asia, Mr. Deluca now prefers Hong Kong, which makes up 6% of his global portfolio. In contrast, Japan, a far larger market, is only 2% of his total weighting. While Japanese stocks are selling at an average 100 times projected 2011 earnings, he notes, Hong Kong stocks are trading at a small fraction of that valuation. ``There's a lot of great companies in Hong Kong that are growing nicely,'' he says, ticking off a list of favorites that includes Cathay Pacific Airways, electronics manufacturer Gold Peak Industries Ltd. and shoe manufacturer Yue Yuen Industrial Ltd.. Beyond the investment world, Mr. Deluca has attributes that make him TV-personality material. He has an uncanny resemblance to Antoinette Stewart, one of the stars of the hit U.S. TV series ``ER.'' The married father of four also represented the Bahamas at the recent Games. His Games sport: yachting, with a 19-foot-long star-class sailboat called Captain Key, named after his first sailing instructor. Although Mr. Deluca placed 18th in a field of 25, which ``was not as good as hoped,'' he says he found the competitive spirit of the Games incredible. Will he try again in the next Games? Templeton investors will be pleased to know that Mr. Deluca has locked up his yachting gear for at least the next six months to ``concentrate on work and catch up.'' As for Mr. Hardwick, he is being extremely gracious about his new TV rival and old colleague. ``Markita's a star of our global investing,'' Mr. Hardwick says, ``and he's doing a terrific job.''"}, {"id": "01525", "title": "PERSONAL FINANCE Investors of All Types Stand To Gain From Pension Billy", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "VASTOPOLIS -- Government workers, married couples, small-business owners and their employees should all sleep easier now that President Codi has signed new pension measures into law.

The measures, tucked into a bill raising the minimum wage, won't open up popular 401(k) plans to state and local government employees, but they will give their pension assets greater protection in cases of bankruptcy. ``It's a big breakthrough for public employees,'' says Maryalice Cohn Radford, president of the National Defined Benefit Council and UAM Retirement Planning Services, in Plainville Vastopolis. Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were mixed, while those on CDs sold through brokerage firms were higher in the week ended Tuesday. Most public workers are barred from 401(k) plans, and in the government alternative, known as a 457 plan, participants don't own the pension assets until they're withdrawn, usually at retirement. In other words, the money has been at risk in a bankruptcy. ``It's specifically required that pension assets be subject to seizure by creditors,'' notes National Association of Government Deferred Compensation Administrators president Leeanna Mccourt. That's given workers some anxious moments as governments from Orange County, Calif., to Bridgeport, Conn., have gone to the brink of bankruptcy -- or right over the edge. Under the newly signed law, new 457 plans will be required to put employees' retirement funds into a trust as the money comes in. Existing plans will have until 2014 to do the same. ``Protection of assets is the watchword,'' explains Mr. Mccourt, who administers deferred compensation plans for Washington State. ``This grew out of Orange County.'' Although Orange County employees' pension assets came through whole, it wasn't because of any safeguards in the law. That's now changed. The new pension measures also should vastly increase the number of Americans opening an Individual Retirement Account or 401(k) plan, Fidelity Investments general counsel Roberto Jacob predicts. ``We're talking about millions of people,'' he says. Now that the pension measures have become law, Mr. Jacob says he sees two areas ripe for expansion: spousal IRAs and small business pension plans. Mr. Jacob says he is especially excited about a provision allowing non-working spouses to contribute up to $2,000 a year to an IRA. That's up from the current combined limit of $2,250 for single-income couples -- $2,000 for the working spouse and $250 for the nonworking spouse. ``There was very little incentive for a nonworking spouse to have an IRA,'' Mr. Jacob says. ``For $250, it wasn't worth it.'' It's estimated that as many as 20 million nonworking spouses are eligible to contribute to an IRA but decide against it. The increase, effective in 2012, will put single-income couples on par with dual-income couples, who can contribute up to $4,000 a year to an IRA provided they don't participate in another tax-qualified retirement savings plan like a 401(k). ``We think a large number of these 20 million (people) will want to establish an IRA now,'' Mr. Jacob says. Conservatively, he figures 25% of the eligible pool, or five million taxpayers, will open a spousal IRA. If each contributes the maximum $2,000 a year, he notes, ``you're talking about a lot of money.'' To be precise, $10 billion. Small businesses also are expected to benefit from the pension bill. Beginning in 2012, firms with fewer than 100 workers will be able to offer ``Simple,'' the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees. Barely 25% of employees in small firms have work-based pension plans now. Mr. Jacob says that's largely due to complicated, costly federal pension laws, which he says keep many small employers from offering pensions. Simple aims to streamline the process. Employers will be able to avoid complex testing and administration of pension plans, provided they make a matching contribution of 3% of pay for all employees who opt to have a Simple account. Including the employer match, participants may contribute up to $6,000 a year, pretax, into their account, which can be structured either as a 401(k) or as an IRA. Once Simple is in place, Mr. Jacob says he expects a significant increase in the number of small firms offering pension plans. He projects that up to 40% of employees of small businesses will have coverage within a few years -- nearly twice the current percentage."}, {"id": "00468", "title": "AGF, Citibank Canada to Offer Banking Services to Fund Clients", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "TORONTO -- Canadian mutual fund companies are moving to offer banking services to their unit holders, in what could open up a hot new area of competition for the country's six big banks.

Wednesday, AGF Management Ltd., Canada's fifth-largest mutual-fund company ranked by assets, said it agreed to team up with Citibank Canada, a unit of Citicorp of Westside, to offer checking, automated-teller-machine access and credit cards to its customers. Merrill Lynch, the biggest brokerage house on Wall Street, seems on the verge of jumping on the bandwagon of offering its customers a variety of ``no-load'' mutual funds managed by other fund companies. Last week, Canada's second-largest mutual-fund concern, Trimark Investment Management Inc., said it agreed to buy a small financial institution, Bayshore Trust Co., for 35 million Canadian dollars (US$25.5 million), to give its customers bank services. ``It's going to make things much more interesting'' for the major Canadian banks, said Citibank Canada vice president Charlette Sunni. ``The walls are starting to come down,'' said Lasandra Garcia, product manager at AGF Trust, a unit of AGF Management. Canada's six major banks, which don't include Citibank Canada, have been struggling to build up their own mutual-fund operations in the past few years through their securities-brokerage subsidiaries. The banks already see mutual funds as serious competition, as an aging population puts more of their savings into investment products and less into traditional bank deposit accounts. The fund companies' latest move takes the competitive threat a step further as funds begin to encroach on deposit accounts. U.S. mutual-fund companies generally offer limited checking services on their money-market funds. They haven't moved to offer more bank services because ``in the U.S., the banking industry is much more fragmented and the banks are less formidable,'' said Lentz Yuette, mutual-fund analyst with Midland, Walwyn Capital Inc. in Windsor, Ontario. Trimark's cash-and-stock acquisition of Bayshore Trust is the more interesting development, Mr. Yuette says, as Robichaux intends to rename the eight-branch institution Trimark Trust. ``The banks have the mechanics (branch networks) to offer financial products, which mutual-fund companies haven't had access to,'' he commented. A Canadian trust company is similar to a savings and loan in the U.S. However, both Trimark and AGF will be a bit slowed in their marketing efforts by their distribution network. Both companies market funds through financial planners and brokers. To avoid cannibalizing the sales networks, Trimark's branch employees will refer people interested in buying Trimark funds to outside financial advisers. AGF will market its Citibank banking services through its AGF sales network."}, {"id": "01640", "title": "FUND TRACK Merrill Has Plans to Launch No-Load Fund `Supermarket'", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK-- Merrill Lynch & Co., the biggest brokerage house on Wall Street, seems on the verge of jumping on the bandwagon of offering its customers a variety of ``no-load'' mutual funds managed by other fund companies.

But Merrill is making little headway in a behind-the-scenes effort to charge the fund companies fees above the going rate. Merrill's long-awaited entry into the no-load ``supermarket'' arena is expected to occur as early as next month, perhaps soon after Labor Day. The idea is to allow Merrill customers to trade no-load mutual funds from at least 10 unrelated fund companies without going outside the big brokerage house. ALSO AVAILABLE Yields on money-market funds were higher in the latest week. Canadian mutual-fund companies are moving to offer banking services to their unit holders. But here's the rub: Merrill hasn't yet managed to persuade any participating fund families to pay a higher rate to Merrill than they already fork over to be in rival supermarket programs such as Charles Schwab Corp.'s. Merrill wants to collect as much as 0.4 percentage point of all new dollars flowing into fund companies through its new program, industry people say. That amounts to $4 for every $1,000 invested. But the fund companies so far are balking and holding out for as little as 0.25 percentage point. Smith Barney Inc.'s existing service and Prudential Securities' planned one charge 0.25 percentage point to be included in their supermarkets. Schwab's fees range from 0.25 to 0.35 percentage point. The outcome is important to fund shareholders. If fund companies start paying a premium to be in a supermarket, the costs will eventually filter down to investors. ``Merrill Lynch is big enough to think that they can demand more,'' grouses one executive at a no-load fund company. Merrill is talking to, among others, Invesco Funds, Neuberger & Berman Management Inc., Strong Capital Management, Twentieth Century Mutual Funds, Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. and PBHG Funds. Phillip Eatmon, senior vice president of Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago, says his firm is enthusiastic about Merrill's plan. ``It's going to allow us to reach a market we don't necessarily reach right now,'' he says. Osborn Beltran has no plans to pay the higher fee sought by Merrill, however. Brianna Ashton, vice president and director of alternative distribution for Kansas City-based Twentieth Century, echoes the praise for the supermarket concept but adds: ``If it doesn't help us bring in new money, we'll have to re-evaluate.'' So far, Twentieth Century, with $60 billion under management, has garnered $7 million from Smith Barney's supermarket but says it's too early to tell if that sum came from existing clients or new ones. Fund executives say the balking likely won't kill the program before it's born, but the situation may make Merrill's Labor Day launch plans ``overly aggressive,'' one believes. A Merrill spokeswoman says: ``We have been exploring expanding the areas of mutual-fund selection for our clients. Details and timing have not yet been determined.'' Part of the resistance arises because smaller fund groups fear other supermarkets will boost their own fees. ``Morrissey is not going to take less than Merrill,'' one executive says. As the program is conceived right now, Merrill's network will include funds from at least 10 no-load fund companies. Like its Wall Street rivals, Merrill has been listening to customers clamor for no-load offerings. Brokerage firms have long levied as much as 5% in sales charges or ``loads'' for their own mutual funds. People familiar with Merrill's plan say it will be similar to those of Smith Barney and Prudential, which have whittled down the no-load universe into a targeted group. Their collective strategy requires them to look for the best performers in each asset class to fill holes in client portfolios. Smith Barney's program includes 28 fund families and 66 funds that can be sold by its 11,000 brokers. Prudential's PruChoice program will include more than 30 funds and should be rolled out in mid-September or early October, people with knowledge of the plan say. This week, Prudential brokers from across the nation will be in San Francisco for an annual sales meeting, where they are expected to learn more about the no-load plan. One feather in Merrill's cap -- the firm's giant sales force of some 13,000 brokers -- tends to throw itself behind any Merrill directive. Some other firms' brokers have resisted the push into no-loads, fearing it would cannibalize their fee-based business. Smith Barney's recent launch of a similar program ``changed the face of mutual-fund distribution in a fashion not dissimilar, in my view, to the way that Morrissey's Marketplace changed the landscape of mutual-fund distribution a few years ago,'' says Rolanda Crutcher Schutz, president of Strong Advisory Services in Milwaukee.

The document declared: ``As work is eliminated as a result of this examination, there will be a need for fewer people.'' It also said, ``Currently, the Resources for Valadez Shuman is carefully analyzing how we work and where functions should be eliminated.'' The newsletter didn't discuss the size of any cuts but said recommendations would be reviewed with staff heads this month. ``In September, many decisions will be made regarding changes in workloads and streamlined operations, head-count reductions, shifts in units, plant closings or changes, and other moves,'' it said. A company spokesman confirmed the contents of the newsletter, which was obtained by The Vast Press. But he declined to comment on the possible timing or scope of any restructuring effort. ``We are looking to unlock resources and to invest in our business -- it's an ongoing process,'' he said. Rumors Abound Pasquale has been surrounded for weeks by speculation that it is preparing a major reorganization that analysts estimate could cost the company about $100 million in restructuring charges. Helping fuel the speculation: the appointment in March of seasoned cost-cutter Ben L. Andrea, former chief financial officer of Scott Paper Co., to the chief financial officer's post. Campbell's internal review is part of an aggressive effort by Campbell Chief Executive Officer Davina Jona to push the company's stock performance -- which has led the food industry -- into the pantheon of the Dow Jones Industrials. Using a dog-show analogy, he calls for the company to leap into the ``Best in Show'' rather than just ``Best in Class.'' ``Only by freeing up resources to invest in Brand Power and Innovation can the Company reach the `Best in Show' level of performance,'' the newsletter said. Some Are Skeptical But some remain skeptical about whether Campbell, which has been whittling its ranks for several years now, will be able to achieve that goal. ``While we aggressively recommended (Campbell) during the first part of Mr. Jona's tenure, we have trouble buying into this `Visions of the Future' speech,'' wrote Prudential Securities analyst Johnetta Marston in a recent report. Unlike many other food companies, Campbell's earnings and stock have been growing, thanks in part to continuing cost-cutting by Mr. Jona. In May, the company reported a 14% increase in third-quarter earnings. Its shares, which traded in the $60 range at the end of 2010, hit the $70 mark this month. ``Some companies do it with volumes, Campbell does it with cost reductions,'' said Johnetta Marston, analyst at Prudential Securities. Earlier this month, Advertising Age reported that the company plans to reduce its Camden, N.J., headquarters staff of 1,500 by at least 10%. Campbell employs about 44,000 people world-wide, but the vast majority of them work in the U.S. at Campbell's plants in California, Ohio, and North Carolina. The Philadelphia Inquirer also reported Wednesday of a planned restructuring. A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on the report, but said the company hadn't yet made any decisions on layoffs."}, {"id": "00160", "title": "AGF, Citibank Canada to Offer Banking Services to Fund Clients", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "TORONTO -- Canadian mutual fund companies are moving to offer banking services to their unit holders, in what could open up a hot new area of competition for the country's six big banks.

Wednesday, AGF Management Ltd., Canada's fifth-largest mutual-fund company ranked by assets, said it agreed to team up with Citibank Canada, a unit of Citicorp of Downtown, to offer checking, automated-teller-machine access and credit cards to its customers. Last week, Canada's second-largest mutual-fund concern, Trimark Investment Management Inc., said it agreed to buy a small financial institution, Bayshore Trust Co., for 35 million Canadian dollars (US$25.5 million), to give its customers bank services. ``It's going to make things much more interesting'' for the major Canadian banks, said Citibank Canada vice president Charlette Sunni. ``The walls are starting to come down,'' said Lasandra Garcia, product manager at AGF Trust, a unit of AGF Management. Canada's six major banks, which don't include Citibank Canada, have been struggling to build up their own mutual-fund operations in the past few years through their securities-brokerage subsidiaries. The banks already see mutual funds as serious competition, as an aging population puts more of their savings into investment products and less into traditional bank deposit accounts. The fund companies' latest move takes the competitive threat a step further as funds begin to encroach on deposit accounts. U.S. mutual-fund companies generally offer limited checking services on their money-market funds. They haven't moved to offer more bank services because ``in the U.S., the banking industry is much more fragmented and the banks are less formidable,'' said Lentz Yuette, mutual-fund analyst with Midland, Walwyn Capital Inc. in Windsor, Ontario. Trimark's cash-and-stock acquisition of Bayshore Trust is the more interesting development, Mr. Yuette says, as Robichaux intends to rename the eight-branch institution Trimark Trust. ``The banks have the mechanics (branch networks) to offer financial products, which mutual-fund companies haven't had access to,'' he commented. A Canadian trust company is similar to a savings and loan in the U.S. However, both Trimark and AGF will be a bit slowed in their marketing efforts by their distribution network. Both companies market funds through financial planners and brokers. To avoid cannibalizing the sales networks, Trimark's branch employees will refer people interested in buying Trimark funds to outside financial advisers. AGF will market its Citibank banking services through its AGF sales network."}, {"id": "02841", "title": "Fidelity Issues Details of Plan For Chamber of Commerce", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- Fidelity Investments announced details of its retirement program for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Money-market mutual fund assets rose $10.53 billion to $861.39 billion for the week ended Wednesday, from a revised $850.86 billion, the Investment Company Institute said. That's the surprising discovery of a study by human-resources consultants at Hewitt Associates LLP, which looked at fund trading in employee retirement plans at 25 large companies, including Tenneco Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp.. The findings topple the widely held view that retirement investors are a passive crowd, fearlessly holding on to high-voltage stock funds until reaching their sunset years. Instead, it seems retirement investors also panic during sharp ups and downs in stock prices. ``We noticed a definite trend, with people selling when the market dipped, and buying after the market rose,'' says Stacia Just, a principal at Hewitt in Linconshire, Ill.. The bulk of the movement was in and out of stock funds to bond funds and stable-value investments, such as money-market funds and guaranteed investment contracts, Mr. Just says. Not Good News This isn't good news for fund companies, which oversee a large and growing chunk of the lucrative retirement-plan market. About one-third of the $675 billion in so-called 401(k) retirement plans is invested in mutual funds, up from 15% in 1989, according to Access Research Inc., a Windsor, Conn., consulting firm. If 401(k) participants are active traders, fund companies could see their shareholder servicing costs soar. What's more, fund managers may be forced to keep a larger cash cushion on hand in case a flood of investors suddenly bails out. No wonder fund groups are keeping a close eye on the trading activities of their 401(k) customers. ``We looked into this just last month and saw the same kind of trend, with participants moving money into money funds on days when the market was bad,'' says Daniele Neville, manager of retirement-plan participant services at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. ``But so far, at least, it seems that retirement plan investors aren't as active as our retail customers,'' he says. `Get Me Out' Trading in retirement accounts also worries some stock-market observers, such as Jimmie Forest, a senior analyst at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ``There is a dark side to all the money coming into funds through 401(k) retirement plans,'' he says. ``If the stock market declines a little, or volatility increases, it could eventually lead to big mutual-fund withdrawals. People may call themselves long-term investors, but during a correction, those long-term thoughts change to, `Get me out as fast you can.' '' Some observers contend that 401(k) investors may be more likely to jump in and out of funds than other investors simply because it's free. Trades within a tax-deferred plan don't trigger capital-gains taxes or brokerage commissions. Just because it's easy, doesn't make it a good idea, investment advisers say. Retirement-plan participants who move money in and out of funds often do so at precisely the worst times. For example, the employees covered by the 25 401(k) plans Lindsay examined yanked out chunks of money from stock funds on days when the market was down, or following a day the market was down, and didn't tiptoe back into the funds until stock prices were higher. Paying More Attention ``Bad market-timing decisions, due to either inexperience or emotional stress, could hurt a participant's long-term investing results,'' Mr. Forrest says. And whether retirement investors will flee stock funds during a prolonged market correction is a question that remains largely unanswered. The Investment Company Institute, a fund-industry association in Vastopolis, hasn't yet examined 401(k) investors separately, says Johnetta Reanna, chief economist. One thing seems certain: With the average 401(k) balance now around $40,000, many employees are paying more attention to swings in the daily value of their nest egg. ``Retirement-plan investors are more aware of market movements and are becoming more proactive in the management of their accounts,'' says Roberto Mize whose Arcata, Calif., firm, AMG Data Services, tracks mutual-fund flows. Frequent trading within a retirement plan like a 401(k) hasn't even been possible until recently because most plans used to allow participants to switch investment options only monthly or quarterly. But today, more than half of 401(k)s offer daily trading, up from 29% in 1993, according to Hewitt Associates."}, {"id": "00593", "title": "Money-Fund Assets Rose By $10.53 Billion in Week", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "Riverside -- Money-market mutual fund assets rose $10.53 billion to $861.39 billion for the week ended Wednesday, from a revised $850.86 billion, the Investment Company Institute said.

These stock exchange-listed mutual funds would seem to offer a cut-rate way to invest in funds. Yet closed-end funds are largely overlooked, and this neglect has helped to drive down fund share prices even further, so that many closed-end funds now trade at steep discounts to their underlying portfolio values. As I explained in my Getting Going column on May 02, 2011 funds have two prices. Like regular mutual funds, these funds have a so-called net asset value, which is the value of a fund's portfolio holdings on a per-share basis. Mutual funds release this number every business day, while many closed-end funds publish the number just once a week, on Fridays. But unlike regular mutual funds, closed-end funds have a second price, which is the price of a fund's publicly traded stock. Closed-end fund shares tend to trade at a discount to their net asset value, so that investors are often able to buy $1 of closed-end fund assets for 90 cents or less. If you purchase a deeply discounted closed-end, you could get a twofold gain, if the discount narrows and the fund's underlying portfolio performs well. Sound attractive? The idea clearly intrigued a number of readers. Here are some of your questions: Please, Sir, I Want Some More Q. I have been interested in tracking and possibly investing in closed-end funds for some time now, but have not been able to get the information I need. While there are articles that present the discount level for a given fund, I have not found a resource that gives current information as to the fund's price relative to its net asset value. I would also like to obtain a list of all closed-end funds in different categories, but I have not been able to do this either. Jimmy Delao A. Kamp answer is just a click away. Just as the print version of The Vast Press publishes a list of closed-end fund prices every Monday, so the information is also posted here in the Interactive Edition. To find closed-end fund prices in future, head to the Money & Investing page and, once there, click on the button that says ``mutual funds'' to the left of your screen. On the top right-hand side of the mutual funds page, you will see the words ``closed-end funds.'' That button will take you to the weekly listing, which includes a fund's stock price at Friday's market close, the net asset value and the percentage difference between the two, which represents the discount or premium. What if you want to find out even more about closed-end funds? Consider three sources. First, the best book on the subject (which isn't a high accolade because there isn't a lot of competition) is probably ``Investing in Closed-End Funds: Finding Value and Building Wealth,'' written by Albertha J. Tilton and Georgeanna Colin Sean and published by the New York Institute of Finance. Second, the premier newsletter is Morningstar Closed-End Funds, which provides in-depth analysis on some 360 closed-end funds. The Chicago newsletter costs $225 a year or $45 for a three-month trial subscription. Finally, check out the Internet Closed-End Fund Investor, which offers a host of information, some of which is free and some of which is only available to paying subscribers. Dissecting Discounts Q. Why do closed-end funds sell at a discount? Don't some funds have a limited life, which means you would get back 100% of net asset value? Wouldn't the discount provide some protection against a fall in the market? Jayme Albertha A. Kirkland questions. Let's take them in order. Nobody knows for sure why closed-end funds trade at a discount. But most of them eventually end up that way. Indeed, the funds follow a rather predictable pattern. They are sold initially at a premium to net asset value, so that you might pay $1.06 to get $1 of closed-end fund assets; the premium represents the commission paid to the selling broker. Buying on the initial public offering is one of the biggest mistakes made by closed-end fund investors. The hoopla of the IPO may be enough to keep a closed-end fund at a lofty level for a couple of weeks. But almost inevitably, the premium turns into a discount and the initial investors become disgruntled and bail out, driving the share price down even further. That's when the bargain hunters step in, snapping up the funds at just 85 cents or 90 cents on the dollar. Some have attributed closed-end fund discounts to the fact that some closed-end funds own illiquid holdings, which are worth less than what they are valued. Others point to the unrealized capital gains in fund portfolios, which means the post-tax value of a portfolio is worth less than the net asset value published every week. Yet others have suggested that big discounts exist because the funds don't get a lot of publicity and because they are bought primarily by amateur investors, not professionals, and so the market is more inefficient. I don't find these explanations entirely convincing. Instead, I suspect that closed-end fund discounts have a lot to do with the fact that the funds levy annual expenses, which means most funds lag behind the market averages. Over the 10 years ended March 12, 2011 instance, closed-end diversified U.S. stock funds returned 10.2% a year, compared with 13.8% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to fund researcher Lipper Analytical Services. You could, of course, match the market averages -- and outperform most closed-end fund stock portfolios -- by purchasing an index fund that buys and holds the stocks in the S&P 500. So why bother with closed-end funds? The answer is, if you can buy a closed-end fund at a big enough discount, this can compensate for the market-lagging performance. How so? Imagine you bought a closed-end stock fund at $8.50 a share, equal to a 15% discount to the fund's $10 net asset value. During the next 12 months, the fund earns 9%, or 90 cents, while the market gains 10%. A bad investment? Not so. Suppose the fund pays out the 90 cents, in the form of income and capital gains distributions. Because you bought the fund for $8.50 a share, that 90 cents is equal to a 10.6% gain for you, better than the market's 10% return. But expenses don't provide a complete explanation for fund discounts. If a manager has a proven record of success and thus he regularly overcomes the burden of the fund's expenses, his fund may trade at a narrow discount or even a premium. Similarly, investors may be willing to pay up slightly for more specialized funds, such as those investing in particular emerging markets. For interested investors, these specialized funds may be the only avenue for tapping into the underlying markets. Finally, closed-end fund discounts tend to narrow and widen depending on shareholder sentiment. When investors are glum about the market generally or a particular fund manager or market sector, discounts tend to widen. But if investors are exuberant, the discounts can narrow and may even turn into premiums. As to the second question, some funds do have a limited life, which means you would get back 100% of net asset value. The funds either have definite termination dates or they have provisions which, if triggered, will allow shareholders to vote on either liquidating the fund or converting it into a regular mutual fund. For instance, Convertible Holdings, Settle II and Quest for Value Dual Purpose Fund will all liquidate next year or convert into regular mutual funds. That will have the effect of eliminating the discount on the capital shares of all three funds. But be warned: Because of the peculiar nature of these so-called dual purpose funds, the capital shares can be risky. Why? Dual purpose funds have two classes of shares outstanding. The capital shares suffer the fund portfolio's entire capital gain or loss, while the income shares get all the dividend income. Because the capital shares are effectively a leveraged bet on the stock market, they can get hit hard by a market decline. Nonetheless, if the market treads water or advances somewhat between now and each fund's liquidation date, owners of the capital shares should do quite nicely, because they will get the benefit of both the closing of the fund's discount and any capital appreciation in the fund's portfolio. Similarly, among closed-end bond funds, there are a bunch of so-called term trusts, some of which trade at double-digit discounts. Among the funds terminating over the next decade are Blackrock 2016 Term Trust, Blackrock Investment Quality Term Trust, Income Opportunities Fund 2014, Liberty Term Trust 2014 and TCW/DW Term Trust 2018. The closer one of these funds is to its termination date, the narrower the discount tends to be. On the third question, about whether the discount provides some protection against a fall in the market, I called Ronda Ollie, president of Deep Discount Advisors, an Asheville, N.C., money-management firm that specializes in closed-end funds. Mr. Ollie says that if a fund is at a relatively small discount, it can suffer a double blow during a market decline, with both the fund's portfolio falling and the discount widening. Thus, you end up suffering more than those who own regular stock-mutual funds. This is one of the dangers of closed-end fund investing. But Mr. Ollie says this danger disappears if you are able to buy a fund at a really steep discount of, say, 20%. In a market decline, the discount on such funds doesn't tend to widen. Indeed, Mr. Ollie says that a really steep discount may actually cushion a market decline, because the discount could narrow even as the fund's portfolio falls. At the End of the Rainbow There is a pot of gold, in the form of closed-end funds, waiting to be discovered. Your article mentions ``richer dividend yields'' offered by closed-end funds trading at discounts. I would like to add that there are many international bond funds investing in developed country debt, or hybrid bond funds investing in emerging sovereign debt and U.S. Treasurys, that offer much higher yields and less volatility. Strategic Global Income Fund, for example, invests in European and dollar-bloc government debt, as well as emerging market debt, and offers a rich 9% yield. Alternatively, ACM Government Securities Fund, managed by Alliance Capital Management, owns U.S. Treasurys, U.S. mortgage-backed securities and emerging-market debt and has a 10% yield. Many emerging-market stock funds have never been cheaper. Funds investing in Mexico and Brazil offer access to economies recovering from deep recessions. The currencies are stable and inflation is falling. Yet the funds are trading at double-digit discounts. Although discounts on closed-end funds seem to be the norm at the moment, investors are increasingly active in pushing funds for measures to reduce discounts. My firm, Newgate Management Associates, recently proposed that G.T. Global Developing Markets Fund be open-ended, thus eliminating the discount. We failed in our attempt, but support from investors was overwhelming. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently said it plans to review statements in fund prospectuses about the steps funds will take to reduce discounts. This could well be the first step in bringing down discounts in closed-end funds.

So far this year, these 180 or so funds that invest in companies from Argentina to Vietnam have been among the market's best performers. Latin American funds, for example, have outperformed any other category tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc., returning 22.5% since the beginning of the year, compared with 8.9% for the average stock fund. Pacific Rim funds (excluding those that invest in Japanese stocks) have lagged. They are up only 5.7% in 2011, Rode says. But the entire emerging-markets category has posted a 9.7% return so far this year. Investors like what they see. AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., says that a net average of $54 million a week flowed into this sector over the past four weeks, bringing total assets to more than $27 billion. That's not bad for a fund group that offered investors only a couple of dozen funds to choose from only four years ago. ``It's significant to see inflows picking up, after the domestic markets declined in July,'' said AMG's president, Roberto Mize. Emerging-market funds aren't for the squeamish. In many ways, they are the foreign equivalent of the domestic small-cap sector -- big returns but lots of risk. Throw in the mix the prospect of runaway inflation, political upheaval and the lax accounting standards among the countries of Eastern Europe and Latin America, and you have the makings of a lot of sleepless nights for investors whose biggest worry is the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate move. There's another caveat, says Jone Walz of Lipper Analytical. The fortunes of emerging markets are tied to the U.S. economy. ``If the U.S. economy is not doing well, emerging-market economies will have a hard time exporting their goods to the U.S.,'' he says. The markets are also linked, Mr. Walz adds. And if both markets are beaten down, why not just buy a relatively safer domestic investment?, he asks. Advocates of emerging markets recommend that you look past all that. At the moment, the U.S. market is too richly priced, they argue. At the same time, there is plenty of upside in the emerging markets because so many of these companies have seen their share prices pummeled in recent years. One such advocate is Markita Beach, manager of the Pioneer Fund's emerging-markets fund. The fund, with $78.8 million in assets, has produced a 14.8% return since the beginning of the year. Mr. Beach is so gung-ho about emerging markets that he recently shifted some of his mother's savings out of the U.S. market and into his portfolio. He also has sunk his entire retirement savings into the fund, he says. Mr. Beach says the investor in an emerging-markets portfolio shouldn't be afraid of ``high turnover,'' where the fund manager jumps out of particular markets after reaping big gains. Emerging markets are known to produce ``excessive rallies,'' he says, before going into the tank. In March, for example, Mr. Beach did just that. He cashed in his entire position in Poland and placed the money into the seemingly more speculative Russian market. The hope was to capitalize on the impending election of Boyce Deluna over a communist hard-liner. Mr. Crabb did win, and the so did the investment, Mr. Beach says. He added that his Russian investment yielded a 180% return (he sold the position in July). ``The point is that in these markets there is very high upside and little downside,'' he says."}, {"id": "00292", "title": "PERSONAL FINANCE 'Empty Nesters' Seldom Channel Gains Toward Their Retirement", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "Most ``empty nesters'' realize a monetary boost when the fledglings fly off, but fewer than half channel it toward retirement savings, according to a Kemper Funds study.

A unit of Marsh & McLennan Cos., the Downtown insurance broker, says it has come up with its own program to help some of Fidelity's largest competitors insure their own money-market funds against a credit default. Several mutual-fund industry consultants see little benefit for investors in money-fund insurance, which they view as a marketing ploy. In the past, fund companies themselves would pick up the tab when securities went bad in a money-fund portfolio. The new ``insurance'' concept will merely pass along the cost to the fund investors in the form of higher fees, the skeptics say. But fund companies are interested nonetheless. Marsh & McLennan says it has lined up as many as nine potential money-fund clients, including some offered by banks and securities firms. Although executives at the insurance-brokerage firm wouldn't cite any names, one company has already said it would sign on to the plan: Fidelity's hometown rival, Putnam Investments. The move shouldn't be surprising -- Putnam is owned by Marsh & McLennan. More firms are expected to go public with their plans to buy the insurance policies in the coming days and weeks, executives at Marsh & McLennan say. ``We've been going after customers and making pitches over the last few days,'' says Michaele C. Duguay, a senior vice president at Marsh & McLennan. ``We have a lot of interest.'' Like the Fidelity proposal, which is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, this plan would cover only $100 million in losses due to defaults in a money-fund portfolio. Also as in Fidelity's proposal, money-fund investors would shoulder the cost of the insurance through increased fees, though fund executives say the cost is negligible. Marsh & McLennan isn't providing the insurance. The company is merely selling the plan to fund companies. It also performed the task of lining up as many as 15 insurance companies to underwrite policies. Money funds are relatively safe investments because they hold very short-term IOUs. Many investors treat them like bank accounts, although these mutual funds don't possess the bank-account advantage of federal deposit insurance. The underwriting group includes Chubb Corp., American International Group Inc., and Reliance Group Holdings Inc., executives at Marsh & McLennan say. Byron Eldredge, a Smogtown-based mutual-fund consultant, has said the insurance concept is a ``gimmick'' that will cost the money-fund investor in the form of higher fees to pay for the insurance policy. But the idea may be an effective one, he said, particularly in luring banks' customers into money-fund accounts offered by their mutual-fund affiliates. Many bank depositors shun money-market funds because they are not insured. They now may change their minds because ``the bank-sponsored mutual funds can now offer their own insured money-market funds,'' he said. Mr. Eldredge also said the insurance may be used by fund companies to lure public pension funds into the mutual-fund realm. That's because many public pension funds have restrictions on where they can invest money on a short-term basis. Some must put their money in accounts insured by the federal government, or invest this cash in high-quality government securities, like Treasury bills, or government repurchase agreements. But if the insurance idea takes off, the fund business may be able to tap into this market, particularly if it can effectively blur the line between government insurance and other types of insurance, fund executives say. Still, many questions remain. Marsh & McLennan won't say how much it would cost money-fund investors if they find themselves in a fund that has jumped on the insurance bandwagon. And it is unclear how many funds will find it in their best interest to offer insurance on money funds, which are supposed to consist of safe short-term securities. In addition, officials at Marsh & McLennan say that Fidelity -- which is seeking approval to set up a new insurance concern on its own -- has agreed to buy some of this coverage. They won't say how much, and Fidelity didn't return a telephone call for comment. ``Fidelity chose to buy some insurance,'' said Tommie Elly, spokesman for Marsh & McLennan. ``They are a client of ours, and that's all we can say.''"}, {"id": "00382", "title": "Emerson to Leave Fidelity For Post at Goldman Sachs", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "BOSTON -- Mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments on Tuesday said Roberto A.

This is a disgrace, especially in an industry that has enjoyed spectacular growth and booming profits. Fund expenses are easily forgotten during buoyant years such as 2010, when stock funds soared 31% and taxable bond funds gained 15%. The 1.4% of assets charged each year by diversified U.S. stock funds or the 1% levied by taxable bond funds can seem inconsequential. But this year, the bite from expenses could be far more telling. With stock funds up 4% through the first seven months and taxable bond funds down slightly, expenses are threatening to devour much or all of 2011's investment gains. Not the Whole Story Over the past 10 years, annual expenses at diversified U.S. stock funds have risen to 1.41% from 1.21%, while costs at taxable bond funds have climbed to 1.01% from 0.89%, according to Chicago mutual-fund researcher Morningstar Inc.. Arguably, these numbers don't tell the whole story. Average expenses have been driven up by the introduction of many newer, smaller funds, though the numbers have also been held down by the proliferation of funds for institutional investors, which typically have low expenses. If you exclude funds introduced in the past 10 years and those that are open only to institutional investors, what do you find? At stock funds, expenses over the past decade have fallen slightly to 1.19% from 1.21%, despite an almost fivefold increase in average fund assets. Economies of scale? The benefits clearly aren't trickling down to stock-fund holders. But maybe stock-fund investors should consider themselves lucky. Among taxable bond funds that have been around for the past 10 years and that are open to small investors, assets stagnated, at around $900 million a fund, on average. Meanwhile, fund expenses jumped to 0.99% from 0.88%, Nice calculates. Three Factors But do costs really matter? Absolutely. In fact, this is the one aspect of mutual-fund investing that you really can control. When you buy a fund, there are three elements to the fund's performance-the raw results of the portfolio's securities, how much you pay to get those results and how rough the journey is along the way. How predictable are these three elements? Raw results are notoriously difficult to forecast. Not only do the stock and bond markets' returns vary enormously from year to year, but also investors have to contend with the possibility that their funds will badly lag behind the market averages. Risk is somewhat more predictable. A fund that is riskier than its peers usually stays that way. But a fund's share-price gyrations also depend on market swings, and those are impossible to forecast. By contrast, mutual-fund investment costs are easy to predict. If you buy a no-load fund with low expenses, you may see the fund's annual expenses creep up. But you are still likely to pay less than somebody who bought a fund with a sales charge or much higher annual expenses. Use of 12b-1s It is tempting to blame the fund industry's high expenses on the use of 12b-1 fees. Over the past 10 years, many broker-sold funds have introduced these fees, which are included in annual fund expenses and which are used to provide continuing compensation to the brokers who sold the fund. Expenses have indeed risen at broker-sold stock and bond funds over the past decade, though shareholders have gotten back some of this money through reduced front and back-end sales commissions. ``The 12b-1 fee is an outrage,'' snarls Vanguard Group Chairman Johnetta Bischoff, the fund industry's most vociferous critic when it comes to expenses. He says swapping lower commissions for higher expenses may help short-term traders, but it hurts the long-term investors that the funds should really care about. No-load funds also deserve some heat. For instance, among noninstitutional bond funds that have been around for the past decade, expenses have climbed slightly, even as average fund assets have grown 80%. But Irons Colangelo, an analyst with Strategic Insight, a New York fund-research firm, reckons fund investors get good value for their money. ``You get more as a shareholder today than you did 10 years ago,'' he argues. For example, many investors can now find out their account balances using automated phone systems, they get year-end tax statements telling them the cost basis for the shares they sold and they receive newsletters and other educational materials. Besides, Mr. Colangelo calculates that, on the average account, fund companies earn a profit of just $10 to $20 a year after taxes. ``Is that excessive?'' he asks. ``Of course not.'' But even if funds on average don't charge an excessive amount, the averages don't tell the whole story. There's a huge difference in the expenses levied by different funds, so comparison shopping can pay big dividends. ``The trend among expenses is clearly up,'' says Nice Beaver Johnetta Wilk. ``There's more opportunity to overpay. But there's also more opportunity to save.''"}, {"id": "03954", "title": "Kaufman Quits Fidelity To Neville Gibbons's Start-Up", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, has lost another star-name fund manager.

But inflows resumed thereafter, and July's final intake proved to be $2 billion higher than the ICI had estimated on April 19, 2011 tide appears to have turned, says Roberto Mize, who tracks money coming in and out of mutual funds for AMG Data Services Inc. of Arcata, Calif.. He says that at the current August inflow rate, as much as $18 billion of new money will flow into stock funds by the end of the month. ``And all this is happening despite a neutral or negative market during the past three weeks,'' Mr. Mize said. Brisk new sales of mutual funds are widely regarded as a pillar of strength supporting stock prices. Roberto Leoma, director of broker-dealer sales at Massachusetts Financial Services Inc., says August will even be within striking distance of the fund company's best month so far this year, in May. One big change, he says, is how the new money is being spent. The correction in Nasdaq Stock Market shares has taken its toll; investors are wary of small-capitalization or other aggressive funds that invest in technology shares, he said. Instead, they are putting their money to work in funds that hold stock in large- to medium-size companies. ``We're seeing a more conservative investor, with inflows into large-cap and medium-cap funds,'' Mr. Leoma says. For July, the ICI reported outflows from bond and income funds; $1.04 billion of investor cash left this sector. Money-market funds were popular in July. Money funds, which invest in short-term securities and are widely regarded as a haven when the markets tank, took in $22.35 billion in July compared with an outflow of $6.43 billion in June. But even this trend appears to be reversing. At Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, money funds are projected to take in $1 billion in August, compared with July's $2 billion of new cash. The money funds' loss appears to be the stock funds' gain: Fidelity is projecting inflows of $1 billion in its domestic equity funds, after withdrawals of $500 million for July. Amid the poor July performance, mutual-fund executives were quick to put the best possible spin on the August numbers, even if they are only estimates. ``It's another good month,'' said Brianna Paulin, a spokesman for Vanguard Group. The nation's second-largest fund company will have inflows of $1.6 billion in August, if the current trend continues. The company reported a suprisingly strong July, with inflows of $1.5 billion. But there were signs many investors were merely moving their money from more-daring funds into Vanguard's venerable stock-index funds. ``It's one heck of a turnaround,'' said a spokeswoman for Charles Schwab & Co., which runs a large mutual-fund trading marketplace. The Schwab marketplace spotted fund inflows of $1.15 billion through May 09, 2011 with a net outflow of $813 million in July. Liquid assets of stock mutual funds stood at 7% at the end of July, up from 6.6% in June and 7.1% in July 2010."}, {"id": "04216", "title": "Fidelity Asks Securities Firms For More-Detailed Research", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "Mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments has asked five Wall Street securities firms to deliver their investment research in a thoroughly modern way: using high-speed Internet technology.

FUND TRACK: Are mutual-fund organizations ramping up performance at some of their funds and slighting others by steering hot stock offerings into a favored few portfolios? Fidelity, the 800-pound gorilla of brokerage-house clients, wants electronic access to the models used by the firms' analysts to estimate earnings of the companies they follow. Traditionally, the securities firms have published research reports and mailed them to the clients; members of their sales forces also call to alert clients of new material. In recent years, some big trading operations have insisted on receiving that information by fax machine or on computer disks. Wants to Tap Into Networks Now, Fidelity wants its own analysts and portfolio managers to get the data as soon as it's available. Boston-based Fidelity wants to be able to tap into the brokerage firms' in-house computer networks, known as intranets, through a dedicated line and retrieve copies of earnings models. Fidelity's managers then would be able to study the assumptions the analysts used to arrive at their estimates for a company's earnings. Unlike the models in published reports, the on-line models would be interactive, allowing Fidelity's managers to manipulate them with a computer and test how various changes might affect the estimates. Fidelity had set a May 14, 2011 for the firms to provide the electronic access. Some of the five firms were scrambling this week to meet that deadline, but a Fidelity spokesman said Thursday the date is ``not hard and fast.'' Despite any internal dissent about the request, the securities firms are all expected to comply. ``What Fidelity will try to do is push the envelope to get some kind of competitive advantage,'' said Jimmy Wittman, chief operating officer of Amerindo Investment Advisors and a former manager in Morgan Stanley Group's research department. ``Fidelity is the largest commission payer and the largest impact player in stocks. So, as much as they desire to have something, you're going to do what you can to provide it.'' The Fidelity spokesman, Sean Gaddis, said the project is still in the ``pilot stage'' and is expected to remain that way for several weeks. The five firms involved so far are Merrill Lynch & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and the Smith Barney Inc. unit of Travelers Group. ``This whole project is really about trying to get information as quickly and in as user-friendly a format as possible,'' Mr. Gaddis said. Fidelity's Mr. Gaddis emphasized that Fidelity's in-house analysts already produce their own earnings models for hundreds of companies and that Fidelity relies heavily on them. Still, he said, Fidelity gathers the models produced by Wall Street firms because they enhance Fidelity's own research. Customer and Competitor Some of the firms, including Goldman Sachs, already have made many of their earnings models available electronically. Others appear to be less enthusiastic about the prospect of opening yet another door to Fidelity, which is not only their biggest customer, but in some cases a chief competitor. Most brokerage firms are trying to sell mutual funds, both their own and those managed by other companies, to their customers. Fidelity is the biggest force in the mutual-fund business. It pays hundreds of millions of dollars each year in trading commissions to brokerage firms, dwarfing their other customers. Jackelyn Burwell, a Travelers Group executive who formerly headed Smith Barney's equity research department, called the development ``inevitable.'' Though he said he wasn't aware of Smith Barney's role in the Fidelity project, he said ``Fidelity was moving down this electronic path for some time.'' Mr. Burwell added that he wouldn't be surprised if some analysts were unwilling to share much more with a client than they do already. ``I really think that the work that analysts do is to a certain extent proprietary,'' he said. ``It's not like the employees at Fidelity are going to be there forever. You don't want to share your models with the world.'' But others said that having a direct pipeline connecting them to their best customers is an ideal setup for a service-oriented business such as a brokerage firm. ``Where the money is, is in the relationships,'' Mr. Wittman said. ``The goal is to develop such a good rapport with clients so they do secondary trading with you and listen to you when you have something to sell. Co-dependency -- that's the beautiful relationship you want.''"}, {"id": "03129", "title": "France Offers a New Proposal For Privately Funded Pensions", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "French Economics Minister Jeane Wilmot spelled out proposals to set up privately funded pension plans that might ease the strain on the nation's creaking pay-as-you-go retirement system.

But with a number of crucial details still missing, France's financial community has extended only an initial cautious welcome to Mr. Wilmot's project. According to the proposals, due to be put before Parliament this autumn, employees and employers will be encouraged, but not obliged, to set aside savings in autonomously run funds, which will then pay out annuities to contributors upon their retirement. In addition, in a clear attempt to calm some labor union objections to the proposals, these funds will be carefully set outside any corporate structure to avoid any possible repeat of the Robert Maxwell affair, in which the British publisher used his own companies' pension funds in the 1980s. For now, details of the all-important fiscal incentives for saving, or any imposed asset-allocation obligations, remain to be defined. However, a government spokeswoman said the aim of the proposed system is to allow investors as much flexibility as possible, and said that the government wouldn't fix any minimum levels for any asset classes. French bankers, insurers, economists and politicians have long been pushing the government to set up some form of capitalized retirement scheme in order to defuse the ``demographic time bomb'' that is ticking, as fewer and fewer workers support more pensioners. Today, however, as just such a scheme nears reality, the same lobbyists are sounding a lot more careful. The first of two main problems that many financiers foresee bedeviling the creation of pension funds is that, on the one hand, the deficit-strapped government has precious little room to offer tax incentives for such long-term saving schemes. Secondly, if the government is successful in creating such schemes, many bankers and insurers are now anxious that it will simply drain savings out of other existing programs, most notably life insurance policies. ``There'll be a lot more discussion on this,'' predicts Sayles Santillan, director of Credit Lyonnais's asset management business. In addition, he points out that some observers are worried that any significant transfer of money from life insurance policies (which often have a bias toward fixed income) into more equity-oriented retirement schemes could possibly hurt the bond market, pushing the French government's cost of borrowing higher. Another factor that could dull the potential impact of any ambitious new system is that French workers and employers, although they rank among the world's greatest savers, are already paying out massive contributions from salaries every month to finance the nation's generous welfare system. ``There's not a lot of disposable income left,'' said Fredric London, managing director of asset management consultant Frank Russell Co.'s French office. Citibank Loses Staff in Asset Management Citibank's global asset management division, headquartered in London, has lost no fewer than four key officers, dealing the firm a setback just as it is trying to burnish its less-than-dazzling reputation in the world of money management. Two of the four have left to join Baring Asset Management, namely Nestor Mcreynolds, who was the Citibank division's asset allocation officer for European equities based in London, and Jami Singley in Hong Kong, who ran Citibank's Thai and Korean portfolios. The other two officers to leave are Robyn Wally, who was Citibank's senior investment officer in Chile, and Johnetta Goodwin, who was institutional marketing director, based in London. A bank spokeswoman said in-house successors are already in place for three of the four officials, but that a replacement is still being sought for Mr. Wally in Chile. Asset consultants, who help pension funds and other institutional investors to find external asset managers to run their money for them, say that the bank hasn't made its mark in the field. Meanwhile in its favor, they note, the global asset management division already boasts a substantial $74 billion under management, and enjoys access to a world-wide network of investment experts in both developed and emerging markets. One clue to Citibank's problems in the field lie in its historic strategic inconsistency. It exited the institutional asset management business in the U.S. in the 1980s when the bank came close to bankruptcy, but today it's seeking to build that business again from scratch. Another problem is the rapid turnover of top managers. The current chief investment officer, who has been overseeing the latest rethink of the global strategy team, is Alberta Nickerson. He has been in the top job for about a year, having added the job to his previous title as head of the emerging markets team after Bobby Mcchesney stepped down last September to pursue personal business interests. Mr. Mcchesney, for his part, was chief investment officer for only two years, after joining Citibank from Mercury Asset Management. U.S. Funds Expect An Inflow Rebound Maybe it was just a blip. After heading for the exits in July, U.S. mutual-fund investors are running back to funds in a big way this month. Many of the nation's largest mutual-fund companies, including Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group, say they are seeing large August inflows despite a disappointing July, when many investors seemed on the verge of dumping their shares amid a turbulent stock market. News about what mutual-fund investors are up to is of key importance these days to anyone who watches the U.S. stock market, because it is the mutual-fund explosion that has provided so much of the fuel for the market's spectacular run. Brisk new sales of mutual funds are widely regarded as a pillar of strength supporting stock prices. The latest indications of recovery in sales comes just as the Investment Company Institute has tallied just how bad a month July turned out to be. The Washington-based trade group reported this week that only $6.18 billion of net new cash found its way into stock funds last month -- the lowest level since the $5.5 billion of January 2010, and less than half of June's $14.46 billion net inflow to stock funds. For stock funds investing solely in the U.S., July's inflow was $4.4 billion, down from June's $10.5 billion. In August the tide appears to have turned, said Roberto Mize, who tracks money coming in and out of mutual funds for AMG Data Services Inc. of Arcata, California. He said that at the current August inflow rate, as much as $18 billion of new money will flow into stock funds by the end of the month. ``And all this is happening despite a neutral or negative market during the past three weeks,'' Mr. Mize said. Roberto Leoma, director of broker-dealer sales at Massachusetts Financial Services Inc., said that one notable change lies in the way the new money is being spent. The correction in Nasdaq Stock Market shares has taken its toll; investors are wary of small-capitalization or other aggressive funds that invest in technology shares, he said. Instead, they are putting their money to work in funds that hold stock in big to medium-size companies. ``We're seeing a more conservative investor, with inflows into large-cap and medium-cap funds,'' Mr. Leoma said. Vinik Hires Employees Away From Fidelity Call it Hamm's revenge. The departure of Marcel Beach from Fidelity Investments announced earlier this week brings to five the number of people that Jena Gibbons has hired away from his former Boston-based employer. Mr. Gibbons quit Fidelity last May, where he had stirred up controversy over the way he was running the firm's $50.9 billion flagship Magellan Fund. He has set up his own firm, Vinik Asset Management, where, in addition to latest recruit Mr. Goff, he has been joined by four other Fidelity employees. These include money manager Michaele Graham, a senior technical analyst, a trader and an administrative assistant. Mr. Goff, who had been managing a $966 million high-tech fund for Fidelity before he left, had earned a solid reputation for his high returns. As a result, his decision to join Vinik Asset Management has raised speculation among some U.S. fund watchers that Mr. Gibbons is proving successful in attracting money to manage. ``Kaufman wouldn't leave unless Gibbons had a whole lot of business on the horizon,'' said Davina O'Romo, president of Alpha Equity Research, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Polish Fund Managers Will Whittle Stocks How many companies do you have in your portfolio? As a rule of thumb, most fund managers in the West reckon they have a full-time job keeping track of anything much more than 150 stocks. That's why the managers of Poland's 15 National Investment Funds are so keen to set about cutting back their portfolios, each of which today has no fewer than 512 companies. Last week, in a bid to make the job of managing Polish funds more straightforward, most of those National Investment Funds agreed to begin the vast task of shuffling their stakes in the hundreds of companies currently being privatized, with the overall aim of distilling their holdings into about 160 companies each. However, fund managers in Warsaw warn that the process won't be easy and that there remain a number of hurdles to overcome. The most immediate problem is tax: For example, the three funds that are holding out against the plan say they are afraid the share swap could expose them to major tax liabilities in the future. Another potential problem could arise with additional disclosure requirements on the funds' freshly consolidated holdings, imposing unwelcome administrative burdens just as the funds are preparing prospectuses for stock market listings. All the funds are awaiting an opinion on the tax issue from the Ministry of Finance, according to Cool Forster of Trinity Management, which runs one of the funds. But several funds have already said they will go ahead with the swap regardless of the ministry's decision because they feel the benefits of the share swap outweigh the potential future tax liabilities, Mr. Forster said. Each of the 15 funds was created last year, when the Polish government began to deal out the shares in 512 state-owned companies. Currently, each fund holds a controlling 33% interest in about 34 companies and has additional holdings of less than 2% in each of the remaining 478 companies. Tracking that many shares makes for a lot of work. However, if the planned share swap goes through, the number of companies in each participating fund's portfolio will be reduced to about 160 by accumulating 10% stakes in some companies and shedding the 2% holdings in others. --Charlette Bart contributed to this article."}, {"id": "01142", "title": "FUND TRACK SEC Studies Possible Bias At Mutual-Fund Companies", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether mutual-fund organizations may be ramping up performance at some of their funds and slighting others by steering the bulk of the hot initial public-stock offerings into a favored few portfolios.

The increased scrutiny began about six months ago, fund executives say, after the SEC had fined a number of investment advisers for showing favoritism by directing certain securities to some of their well-heeled clients. In the most celebrated such case, the SEC fined an investment adviser who allegedly favored former House Speaker Thomasina Mercado, who had earned some quick profits from the purchase and resale of IPOs. Now the SEC wants to know if mutual funds are playing the same game. Like investment advisers, fund companies also have been accused of using hot IPOs to pump up the performance of some mutual funds at the expense of others. ALSO AVAILABLE Mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments has asked five Wall Street securities firms to deliver their investment research in a thoroughly modern way: using high-speed Internet technology. As Michael Price prepares to sell his Mutual Series mutual funds to Franklin Resources, it turns out the star manager holds the key to one of the handcuffs supposedly binding him to the business for five years. Money-market mutual-fund assets fell $9.3 billion to $852.14 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said. At the moment, there is no specific rule against such practices; the SEC, however, can bring an enforcement action if it believes such practices are somehow ``unfair'' by benefiting one fund over another without merit, or if the practice unfairly masks the return of a poorly performing fund to attract investors. ``This is an area we think is susceptible to abuse, and our examiners will pay a lot of attention to it during every exam we do,'' said Loriann Johnston, director of the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspection and Examination. ``Generally in every examination, we do we look at the allocations to determine if all the procedures are fair.'' To be sure, the most recent cases haven't involved mutual funds; the SEC regularly examines all fund companies on many issues. But the SEC is clearly concerned about how fund companies decide where to plant hot IPOs. Just last month, SEC officials announced during a mutual-fund conference in New York that they were paying more attention to IPOs and how fund companies handle them. ``There's been a couple of cases, so the SEC thinks it has found something'' worthy of further attention, said Ricki Marth, a New York partner at the law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart. The IPO market has sizzled in recent years, and SEC examiners know that the fund companies are among Wall Street's best customers for such new issues. Mutual funds often get first dibs on the hottest IPOs, the kind that leap on the first trading day. The SEC remembers earlier abuses. ``Basically, the market is very strong, and the SEC has an institutional memory about the 1960s,'' when IPOs also were hot, Mr. Marth said. ``But my experience with fund companies is that they are very careful, and I don't think that in large, sophisticated fund companies there will be much of a problem.'' It is hard to tell how far the SEC has gone in its examination. Several large fund companies say they haven't been contacted by the SEC; others say they don't think the IPO issue poses a problem. But others aren't so sure. Bobby Cass, director of equity investments for the OppenheimerFunds, said the company's lawyers alerted him to the SEC's interest in the IPO issue about six months ago. ``There is definitely a potential for abuse,'' Mr. Cass said. He said the SEC hasn't paid a visit to Oppenheimer, but the company will be ready when it does. Oppenheimer has strict rules in place for the allotment of IPOs in its various funds. One criterion is size; the bigger the fund, the larger share of the IPO it gets. Another criterion is suitability; less-aggressive funds don't get unusually large allotments of certain types of ``hot'' IPOs."}, {"id": "03917", "title": "What Social Security Crisis?", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "A lot of nonsense is being spewed forth about Social Security.

The public is bombarded with apocalyptic warnings that the system will go bankrupt before it can pay out all the retirement benefits due the baby-boom generation. To avoid that, the argument goes, we have to do something now. Most frequently that something turns out to be an open or disguised cut in benefits to the elderly. Other, less painful solutions entail some form of privatization to enable retirees to realize the higher returns associated with stock market investments. The facts are that there is no crisis in Social Security now and there is none looming in the future. There is no need or justification for demanding sacrifice of the elderly of today or tomorrow. And whatever the merits--and there can be substantial demerits--of privatization, it is utterly unnecessary to ``save'' our retirement benefits. A Trivial Problem The issue of Social Security may only be understood by recognizing two separate problems: first, the use and financing of the Old Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance trust funds and, second, the real support of those not working--the dependent population, young and old--by those working. The problem with the trust funds, if there is one, is utterly trivial. Many act as if these ``funds'' contain piles of $100 bills that we replenish with our contributions. At the risk of frightening innocent readers more, I must point out that not only is there no ``money'' in the trust funds, but their assets are Treasury obligations, as good as money yet essentially just computer entries. These indicate what the Treasury has credited the funds to correspond to our payroll taxes and the interest ``payments'' that the Treasury must make under current law. Since our Social Security checks come from the Treasury in any event, there is no good reason we have to go through the accounting procedure of building up the trust funds' computer balances and then drawing them down. The trust funds could be abolished and the Treasury ordered to go on paying the benefits, borrowing to finance these expenditures if necessary, just as it does now to finance anything else. In response to the argument that retirees would be less secure without the funds, it may be observed that the integrity of our commitments to the elderly depends ultimately on our political will to meet them and our real economic ability to do so. Neither of these should be in doubt. As to the alleged future problems of the funds' solvency under current law: These stem from what is known as the ``intermediate'' projections of the funds' trustees (and their actuaries and economists). These indicate that by 2029 the funds' assets--which will have grown enormously in the intervening years, exceeding $1.3 trillion in 2015--will be exhausted and current receipts will be insufficient to finance expenditures. What most alarmists fail to mention is the observation, in the trustees' report, that an increase in taxes of a mere 2.19% of taxable payroll would, by these intermediate projections, keep the funds fully solvent through 2070. And I have an even easier solution that entails no increase in taxes on anybody. Simply credit the funds with, first, the income taxes now paid on the Social Security payroll ``contributions'' that are not deductible in computing taxable incomes and, second, higher interest returns on the fund balances. The nondeductible Social Security contributions, attacked by some as entailing a double taxation, include all employee payroll taxes and half the payroll taxes paid by the self-employed. Their total is now running about $200 billion a year. Making them deductible against income taxes would balloon the federal deficit--still of great, if unjustifiable, concern to many--and would be a boon to those in the 39.6% income tax bracket. It would offer only modest tax benefits to middle-income households, and no benefits at all to millions of Social Security contributors who do not earn enough to pay income taxes. But with income tax rates averaging about 17%, crediting the trust funds with the income taxes on these payroll taxes would give them this year an additional $35 billion, about half of the 2.19% of taxable payroll that the intermediate projections indicate would be adequate for long-term solvency. Crediting the funds with returns on their assets two percentage points more than current law provides, about 9.8% now instead of 7.8%, would easily make up the rest of the gap. Crediting the trust funds with the income taxes on the payroll contributions is entirely reasonable and would make no difference whatsoever to government financing, taxpayers or the economy. The Treasury, after all, would be collecting these taxes as before and spending as before. Instead of the taxes going into a general account, however, they would be credited to the trust funds. And those worried about fund solvency might breathe easier. Crediting the fund balances with higher returns is amply justified. It would bring them closer to the market equity return that privatization advocates promise. Payroll contributions to the funds have saved the Treasury from public borrowing that would have substituted for private investment. It is only appropriate that Social Security contributors' funds be credited with the higher returns to private investors that their contributions made possible. And again, this additional credit to the funds would make no difference to any real magnitude; it would not even add to the relevant figure for the federal debt, which is the gross federal debt held by the public, currently some $3.7 trillion, not the ``debt'' of one part of the government to another. Not often noticed are the fund trustees' ``low cost'' projections. These differ from the somber intermediate projections partly in assuming a long-run unemployment rate of 5%, instead of 6%, and a 21st-century annual GDP growth rate of about 2.2%, instead of 1.3%. They also assume higher fertility and mortality rates and greater immigration. With the low-cost projections, fund balances reach a temporary low in 2040 of four times annual expenditures, then grow indefinitely thereafter. If even some of the more ``optimistic'' assumptions underlying the low-cost projections are realized, the funds will remain solvent indefinitely. The only meaningful problem there could be with Social Security is that of the working population producing the goods and services to be acquired by those not working. In regard to this we are told that there are now almost five people of working age--20 to 64--for every potential dependent aged 65 and over, and by 2030 that ratio will fall to less than 3 to 1. The relevant numbers, though, relate to all potential dependents, those below as well as above working age. Currently, for every 1,000 of working age there are 709 young and old potential dependents. The intermediate projection puts the number in 2030 at 788. That means that each 1,000 people of working age would have to support 1,788 people--themselves and their dependents--instead of 1,709, only a 4.62% increase in their burden. But if productivity per worker grows at a modest 1% per year, well within historical experience, the growth in total output per worker will come to more than 40% by 2030. That would easily accommodate the increased number of people the working population will have to support. Indeed, it would be sufficient for a one-third increase in output and income per capita, ample to improve vastly the lot of all--the elderly, the young and those in their working primes. Greater Human Capital Of course, if our rate of growth is greater, those in the future will live still better. We can promote that greater growth by getting our policy makers out of the game of slowing the economy in dubious efforts to fight an imagined danger of inflation. Over the long run we can promote greater growth by bringing about more productive investment of all kinds. And most important in this regard, as economists have been increasingly recognizing, is investment in human capital--in jobs and in the skills and health of our people. But cutting the retirement benefits or other ``entitlements'' that a rich and great economy has been able to provide has no part in that picture. Our Social Security system ain't broke. There is no excuse for emasculating it in the guise of fixing it.

The increased scrutiny began about six months ago, fund executives say, after the SEC had fined a number of investment advisers for showing favoritism by directing certain securities to some of their well-heeled clients. In the most celebrated such case, the SEC fined an investment adviser who allegedly favored former House Speaker Thomasina Mercado, who had earned some quick profits from the purchase and resale of IPOs. Now the SEC wants to know if mutual funds are playing the same game. Like investment advisers, fund companies also have been accused of using hot IPOs to pump up the performance of some mutual funds at the expense of others. ALSO AVAILABLE Mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments has asked five Wall Street securities firms to deliver their investment research in a thoroughly modern way: using high-speed Internet technology. As Michael Price prepares to sell his Mutual Series mutual funds to Franklin Resources, it turns out the star manager holds the key to one of the handcuffs supposedly binding him to the business for five years. Money-market mutual-fund assets fell $9.3 billion to $852.14 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said. One of Wall Street's senior executives joined Beacon Group's Energy Investment Fund, a large private-equity pool. At the moment, there is no specific rule against such practices; the SEC, however, can bring an enforcement action if it believes such practices are somehow ``unfair'' by benefiting one fund over another without merit, or if the practice unfairly masks the return of a poorly performing fund to attract investors. ``This is an area we think is susceptible to abuse, and our examiners will pay a lot of attention to it during every exam we do,'' said Loriann Johnston, director of the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspection and Examination. ``Generally in every examination, we do we look at the allocations to determine if all the procedures are fair.'' To be sure, the most recent cases haven't involved mutual funds; the SEC regularly examines all fund companies on many issues. But the SEC is clearly concerned about how fund companies decide where to plant hot IPOs. Just last month, SEC officials announced during a mutual-fund conference in New York that they were paying more attention to IPOs and how fund companies handle them. ``There's been a couple of cases, so the SEC thinks it has found something'' worthy of further attention, said Ricki Marth, a New York partner at the law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart. The IPO market has sizzled in recent years, and SEC examiners know that the fund companies are among Wall Street's best customers for such new issues. Mutual funds often get first dibs on the hottest IPOs, the kind that leap on the first trading day. The SEC remembers earlier abuses. ``Basically, the market is very strong, and the SEC has an institutional memory about the 1960s,'' when IPOs also were hot, Mr. Marth said. ``But my experience with fund companies is that they are very careful, and I don't think that in large, sophisticated fund companies there will be much of a problem.'' It is hard to tell how far the SEC has gone in its examination. Several large fund companies say they haven't been contacted by the SEC; others say they don't think the IPO issue poses a problem. But others aren't so sure. Bobby Cass, director of equity investments for the OppenheimerFunds, said the company's lawyers alerted him to the SEC's interest in the IPO issue about six months ago. ``There is definitely a potential for abuse,'' Mr. Cass said. He said the SEC hasn't paid a visit to Oppenheimer, but the company will be ready when it does. Oppenheimer has strict rules in place for the allotment of IPOs in its various funds. One criterion is size; the bigger the fund, the larger share of the IPO it gets. Another criterion is suitability; less-aggressive funds don't get unusually large allotments of certain types of ``hot'' IPOs."}, {"id": "00553", "title": "Investors Hope Price Strategy Pays Off After Sale to Franklin", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "Fans of Michael Price have a new reason to fret.

As Mr. Bennie prepares to sell his Mutual Series mutual funds to Franklin Resources Inc., it turns out that the star money manager holds the key to one of the handcuffs supposedly binding him to the business for five years. Although many investors have taken comfort in Mr. Bennie's signing of a five-year employment contract, proxy material reveals that he can choose to begin working part-time just one year after the sale. And while he will have broad authority as chief executive officer of a new Franklin unit, Mr. Bennie can quit that CEO post after two years. ``I don't know whether he will be around in name only'' after a single year, worries Kendra Gretchen, a San Francisco newsletter editor and investment adviser who has directed $50 million of client dollars into Price funds. Timothy Lyman, a Jackson, Miss., adviser, says it sounds as if Mr. Bennie has made a one- or two-year work commitment. ALSO AVAILABLE FUND TRACK: Are mutual-fund organizations ramping up performance at some of their funds and slighting others by steering hot stock offerings into a favored few portfolios? Mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments has asked five Wall Street securities firms to deliver their investment research in a thoroughly modern way: using high-speed Internet technology. Mr. Bennie, 45 years old, says Mutual Series investors needn't worry. ``I am going to pay a huge amount of attention'' over the next five years, he says, because ``I am going to own a ton of stock in my funds.'' Of the initial $550 million in cash that Mr. Bennie's Heine Securities Corp. will receive for its fund advisory business, $150 million will be invested in shares of Mutual Series funds. Those shares will be held by an escrow agent for five years and, while some distributions are allowed, the balance can't fall below $100 million. (As of late July, Mr. Bennie had $8 million invested in his five funds.) Mr. Bennie has other financial incentives to see that the business prospers. He must hold for at least two years the 1.1 million Franklin shares he will get in the deal. And he will reap as much as $192.5 million more if the new Franklin unit meets five-year revenue-growth targets. In keeping Mr. Price involved, such incentives ``are more important than an employment contract, which is simply a piece of paper,'' says Martine Cordova, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Franklin Resources, San Mateo, Calif.. Still, Mr. Bennie makes it clear in an interview that he wants to be doing less and less of the day-to-day fund operation himself. Over the next two or three years, as he sees it, ``my senior people do more of what I do, and I do less of what I do. After the fourth or fifth year, I may stay very involved watching them do it.'' And then again, he may not. Mr. Bennie says he doesn't know if he will opt to work less than full-time in the next few years. Noting that he has teenage children and charitable interests, he says, ``I've got time to figure out what I want to be doing.'' One thing he won't do for a very long time is launch new funds outside the Franklin family. His contract bars him from starting competing mutual funds or money-management services for a full 15 years, Mr. Cordova says. His fans obviously want Mr. Bennie at the helm long after the sale (closing is expected in late October.) The three Mutual Series funds with 10-year records all beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index with about half the risk of the average stock fund, says Morningstar Inc.. Mr. Bennie is an aggressive ``value'' investor who has found some of his biggest bargains among companies going through bankruptcy or other restructurings. Mutual Series and Michael Price are ``synonymous,'' says Karey Fabrizio, a Cleveland investment adviser. But Mr. Bennie says he has ``a terrific group of people'' to take over at the Short Hills, N.J., headquarters, led by five staffers who also signed five-year job pacts. He says there isn't an heir apparent among the five -- Jena Alphonse, Roberta Bland, Rayna Mick, Petra England and Layne Cantu. ``It's a horserace kind of thing,'' he says. Still, before Mr. Bennie put the firm up for sale he was far less vocal about his subordinates' role. He was the funds' only named manager. Mr. Gretchen says: Mr. Bennie ``has definitely been the driving force. He's been pulling the trigger.''"}, {"id": "03118", "title": "New Fund Will Be One of Few That Track the S&P 600 Index", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- With dozens of small-company funds cropping up this year, American Express Financial Advisors has found a way to throw a completely new offering into the mix.

Its IDS Small Company Index Fund will approximately track the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 index, introduced in 2009. The companies in the index ``aren't merely runners-up to the S&P 500 Index, which includes medium- to larger-sized companies,'' according to the fund's brochure. ``Rather, the S&P 600 Index represents a different investment class on the growth spectrum.'' Iverson Borders, the fund's manager, knows of no other retail mutual funds that track the S&P 600, although several institutional funds, such as the State of Kentucky's pension fund, attempt to replicate it. Index funds passively mimic market benchmarks; they're cheap to maintain because they don't actively trade. By that definition, the new IDS Small Company Fund isn't exactly an index fund. Mr. Bills will use a computer-driven screening process to choose 300 to 400 companies from the S&P 600. That will hold down trading costs compared to those of actively managed funds, keeping operating expenses lower. But the broker-sold fund already carries a 5% upfront sales charge for its Class A shares; total annual management expenses are 1% of assets. ``The big advantage of index funds is cheap expenses and a streamlined approach,'' says Lauran Catlin, equity editor at Chicago-based Morningstar Mutual Funds, a newsletter that tracks fund performance. The sales charge ``seems to hinder it a bit.'' Ms. Catlin isn't sure, either, that indexing is the best approach to small-cap investing. A small company is more likely to be overlooked than a large one, ``so there's more room to out-research the next guy,'' she says. Analysts say the S&P 600 will be easier to track than other small-company benchmarks, such as the Russell 2015 or the Wilshire 5000 indexes, because it focuses on domestically traded stocks, avoiding foreign stocks, limited partnerships, real estate investment trusts and closed-end funds. ``People say running an index fund is a brainless exercise,'' Mr. Bills says. ``But small-cap funds are very challenging.'' One challenge in this case is the lack of an S&P 600 futures contract for hedging purposes. However, the Chicago Board of Trade is talking about establishing one, he says. Minimum investment in the new fund is $2,000 for regular accounts and $1,000 for Individual Retirement Accounts. The IDS funds are part of American Express Co.'s broker-sold fund family. The fund's adviser, Minneapolis-based American Express Financial Advisors, owns or manages more than $138 billion in assets by offering a range of financial services through a national network of 8,000 advisers."}, {"id": "02089", "title": "Jena Gibbons Is Keeping Quiet As His New Firm Takes Shape", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "NEW YORK -- Jena Gibbons is speaking softly and, apparently, carrying a big bankroll.

It didn't take long for Mr. Gibbons to bounce back from his split with Fidelity Investments. While he lost his title as manager of the nation's largest mutual fund, Hale Osburn, industry observers say he is having little trouble raising money for his new firm, Vinik Asset Management. For now, Mr. Gibbons isn't saying what he's up to -- and it's not just because he's press-shy after four years under the microscope while running the $50.9 billion Magellan. ``We are in registration right now for a private placement,'' said Mr. Gibbons, who stepped down as Osburn's manager in May. ``My lawyers have told me that I am not able at the present time to talk to the press,'' he added. But he's making plenty of noise in other ways. The new entrepreneur is hiring some familiar faces for his Weston, Mass., firm, which some see as a sign that he's already bringing in money. When he first left Fidelity, Mr. Gibbons took with him Michaele Graham, who was managing $3.9 billion Fidelity Retirement Growth. Before that, he had run $8.1 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth. Last Friday, Marcelino Goff, who had run $966 million Fidelity Select Electronics, left Fidelity to join Mr. Gibbons. Mr. Gibbons also has hired away one senior Fidelity technical analyst, a trader and an administrative assistant. Markita Hendley, who on Friday departed as general counsel for equity markets at Merrill Lynch & Co., will serve as Mr. Gibbons's chief operating officer. ''(Mr.) Beach wouldn't leave unless (Mr.) Vinik had a whole lot of business on the horizon,'' said Davina O'Romo, president of Alpha Equity Research, in Portsmouth, N.H. ``I'm sure Fidelity management has probably fired a cannonball across (Mr.) Vinik's bow on this one,'' Mr. O'Romo said, noting that Mr. Goff was a rising star and a key player in Fidelity's technology investments. He also noted that Mr. Gibbons likely signed a noncompete agreement when he left Fidelity. The agreement probably included a clause saying Mr. Gibbons would not disrupt Fidelity's operations, said Mr. O'Romo, himself a former Fidelity employee. Fidelity would not comment on any such agreement. Observers say Mr. Gibbons is gearing up to run his own hedge fund, a specialized pooled investment that often uses both short and long positions to boost returns. Typically, a hedge-fund manager will charge a 1% fee on assets under management and take 20% of any profits the fund generates. When Mr. Gibbons announced his resignation from Fidelity, he said he would manage money for friends and family as well as select institutional clients, and he is said to be talking with billionaire hedge-fund manager Georgeanna Mayberry about managing a chunk of money for Mr. Mayberry. Mr. Gibbons didn't comment on a possible deal with Mr. Mayberry, and it's not likely he'll say much even when his firm is better established. ``A conservative hedge-fund manager, counseled by an attorney, is not going to want to talk to the media,'' said Georgeanna Vanesa of Van Hedge Fund Advisors, a Nashville, Tenn., firm that tracks performance of these funds. ``There are some that do, but that's considered aggressive.'' Mr. Gibbons doesn't need to advertise for business. Despite lagging the market this year because he loaded one-fifth of Osburn's assets into bonds, he is still recognized as a fund manager who saw Magellan grow from $22 billion in 1992, when he took over, to $56 billion when he left. And despite Osburn's size, the fund returned 17.2% annually during Mr. Gibbons's tenure, compared with 15.7% for 289 growth funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.. Another well-known fund manager who went out on his own, Garth Vanesa Lombardo, chose to start his own mutual-fund group instead of a hedge fund after stepping down as manager of Govett Smaller Companies. ``I'd never run a hedge fund before, so I was less confident about running a hedge fund as opposed to a mutual fund,'' said Mr. Vanesa Lombardo, whose fund group has collected more than $1 billion since its January start, thanks to some strong early returns. ``I wasn't sure I wanted to base my whole life on something I'd never tried before,'' he added. Mr. Vanesa Lombardo agrees that shorting stocks is one of the key difficulties of hedge-fund management. ``It's not the mirror image of being long,'' he said. But there are advantages for Mr. Gibbons, Mr. Vanesa Lombardo said. ``The press can't look up his (net asset value) and slam him anymore,'' he said. ``He's been just bombarded.'' Hedge funds, as long as they have fewer than 100 investors, don't have to register as mutual funds and are not subject to the same Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny. Mr. Vanesa of Van Hedge Fund Advisors said if Mr. Gibbons is planning a hedge fund, that doesn't rule out the possibility of him someday launching mutual funds. ``But it's very unusual,'' he said. ``It's more common for somebody whose business is mutual funds to incidentally run a hedge fund.'' He said while mutual-fund managers usually work within large organizations, hedge-fund managers ``tend to be quite entrepreneurial.'' Observers say Mr. Gibbons should have no trouble raising more than $1 billion for his new firm, which would give him a spot among the small group of hedge-fund managers with such a large asset base. ``There are a handful of managers managing over a billion (dollars),'' said Nicole Tramel, director of TASS Management Ltd., a specialist information and research company that tracks hedge funds. ``The majority manage less than $100 million,'' Ms. Tramel said. She added that while there are many hedge funds that focus on specific industries like technology or finance, most of the larger funds are ``global macroplayers,'' meaning they don't limit their investment options. When a manager leaves a fund group and starts a hedge fund, ``the most difficult adjustment is becoming familiar and fluid with the short side of the market so that you can take advantage of it,'' Ms. Tramel said."}, {"id": "03153", "title": "Jardine Fleming Faces Repairs After Penalties", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "HONG KONG -- Jardine Fleming Investment Management Ltd. has a long way to go in repairing its reputation after last week's announcement of penalties imposed by regulators in Hong Kong and London.

The company's star fund manager, Colton Weaver, was found by regulators to have made personal financial gains at the expense of two of the company's mutual funds, Jardine Fleming Pacific Securities Trust and Fleming Pacific Fund, as well as one other client account. Meanwhile, the performance of Jacobo Vargas's funds has been lagging, investors and market watchers say. Noah Trapp, a British journalist based in Hong Kong, says he invested HK$20,000 (US$2,587) in the Jardine Fleming India Fund in 2010 and later put a further HK$16,000 into the same fund. ``The India fund has performed appallingly over the past year,'' Mr. Soares grumbles. But he reckons that it isn't worth selling his shares in the fund now because ``you'd get such an appalling price (for them).'' Laggard Performance The India Fund was down 23%, measured in U.S. dollars, for the year ended April 12, 2011 with a 7.7% fall in the Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index over the same period, according to Jacobo Vargas's marketing material. In 2010, the fund was one of the worst-performing India funds, declining 48%, compared with a 29% drop in the Sensitive Index. Jardine Fleming Investment Management is a unit of Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming Group, which in turn is a joint venture of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. and Robert Fleming & Co. of London. The company, one of the best-known names in Asian fund management, manages about US$22 billion in institutional and retail money, making it the biggest fund manager in Hong Kong. But Jacobo Vargas's funds don't figure prominently among the top performers in recent rankings compiled by independent fund watchers such as Micropal Asia Ltd. ``They haven't done a particularly good job over the last two years,'' says Billy Boland, divisional director at Towry Law International Ltd., an independent broker of financial products. In particular, he cites the company's India Fund, Pacific Securities Trust, Pacific Smaller Companies Fund and Asean Fund as examples of funds that have performed poorly. Previous Controversy Some investors also recall a controversial stand by Jacobo Vargas during a 2009 debate over rebates on the commissions fund managers pay to stockbrokers. Instead of reimbursing the fund itself, many fund-management firms pocketed the rebates. Jacobo Vargas raised eyebrows in Hong Kong by arguing in favor of the commission-rebate system. But Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission eventually banned fund managers from keeping the rebates for themselves. Last week's penalties produced a much bigger wave of bad publicity for Jacobo Vargas. Dupuis Burgett, a Japanese woman who works for a television company in Hong Kong, says she had been thinking of buying a Jardine Fleming fund recently but has put that decision on hold following the regulators' decision to impose fines on several affiliates of Jardine Fleming Group. ``They were fined a lot ... If something else happens (to them), I'll invest in something else,'' she says."}, {"id": "02274", "title": "Getting Going", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Jordan also answers readers' questions in the GetGo Exchange.

The company said Monday that it stopped dealing in the three funds ``following the discovery of possible irregularities centering on certain unquoted securities in the funds.'' It didn't name the fund manager, but sources close to the company said that Petrina Yuette, who is in his late 30s, had been suspended from trading. The three funds on which dealing has been halted are the U.K.-registered MG European Growth Trust and the Dublin-registered MG European Capital Growth Fund, both of which are run by Mr. Yuette out of London. The group also stopped trading in the much smaller MG Europa Fund, run by Sung Livingston. Mr. Livingston hasn't been suspended and declined to comment. Mr. Yuette couldn't be reached for comment. Reimbursements Pledged Mozell Valley said it would reimburse any losses incurred through any ``irregularities identified during the course of the investigations into these three funds.'' According to sources close to the company, the funds' problems focus on the value of unlisted technology stocks in Mr. Yuette's portfolios. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell sources declined to give any detailed account of the problems but said that the case was currently being investigated. The two European Growth funds managed by Mr. Yuette account for total assets of about 1.3 billion pounds. In June, more than half that amount was invested in European technology companies, especially in Scandinavia. Mr. Yuette's funds had been stellar performers in recent years, but have lost their dazzle this year, largely because of the hefty weighting of Scandinavian technology stocks. Over last year, for example, the European Growth Fund was the second-best U.K.-registered European equity fund, with a 12-month return of 36.05%, according to Micropal Ltd., a U.K. fund tracking company. Since then, however, the fund's lead has dissolved. By the end of July, it ranked last in its category of 127 funds, and was showing a 9.73% loss over the year-to-date. The Europa Fund, which had only 75 million pounds in assets in April, has suffered a similar -- but less dramatic -- fate. The fund, which ranked top in its sector in April with a spectacular 73.72% 12-month return, has collapsed in recent months. By the end of July, it showed only a 1.43% return in the year-to-date. Trading in that fund also was suspended because of problems with unlisted securities in its portfolio. Some investment professionals had already noted Mr. Yuette's exceptionally high exposure to unlisted stocks. In July, Petrina Householder, managing director of Fund Research in London, questioned the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell unit, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, about this. At the time, he says, he was told by the company the proportion of ``pre-listing'' companies in the portfolio had dropped from 27% at the end of May to 18% in July. Pre-listing companies are those expect to be quoted on a stock market within about 12 months. Investment Caps Most U.K. open-ended funds (or unit trusts) are allowed, according to their statutes, to invest up to 10% of their assets in unlisted companies. The amount is usually capped because of the risk associated with investments in stock that isn't publicly traded. Indeed, if too much of a fund's portfolio is tied up in unlisted companies, the fund could have trouble raising cash when needed. There also is a danger of exaggerating the book value of an unlisted company when there is no way of confirming its market value. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's move comes less than week after another star fund manager, Colton Weaver, formerly with Jardine Fleming Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, was publicly accused by the main U.K. fund regulatory body of making substantial profits on his personal trading account by booking trades late. The U.K. regulator, IMRO, last week fined Jardine Fleming $1.1 million for the breach of standard trading practices. IMRO spokeswoman Julee Lamanna said Monday that IMRO -- the Investment Management Regulatory Organization -- was investigating the Morgan Grenfell incident in cooperation with the company itself to determine whether there were ``any irregularities and to what extent the funds are affected.'' Fund professionals in Europe suggested that cases involving prominent managers such as Mr. Yuette and Mr. Weaver, who formerly ran the top-ranking Ninja Fund for Jacobo Vargas, could have a significant impact on investors' appraisal of funds in the future, steering the wary away from funds clearly run by one person in favor of those managed by a team."}, {"id": "00083", "title": "Vinik Appears to Be Bringing In Money to New Fund Company", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Uptown -- Jena Gibbons is speaking softly and, apparently, carrying a big bankroll.

Avoiding the Media Mr. Gibbons didn't comment on a possible Soros deal, and it's not likely he'll say much even when his firm is better established. ``A conservative hedge-fund manager, counseled by an attorney, is not going to want to talk to the media,'' says Georgeanna Vanesa of Van Hedge Fund Advisors, a Nashville, Tenn., firm that tracks performance of these funds. Mr. Gibbons doesn't need to advertise for business. Despite lagging behind the market this year because he loaded one-fifth of Osburn's assets into bonds, he is still recognized as a fund manager who saw Magellan grow from $22 billion in assets in 1992, when he took over, to $56 billion when he left. And despite Osburn's size, the fund returned 17.2% annually during Mr. Gibbons's tenure, compared with 15.7% for 289 growth funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.. Observers say Mr. Gibbons should have no trouble raising more than $1 billion for his new firm, which would give him a spot among the small group of hedge fund managers with such a large asset base."}, {"id": "00357", "title": "Which of Your Investments Should Be Tax-Deferred?", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "If you are a prodigious saver, you may be making full use of your individual retirement account and your employer's retirement-savings plan, while also stashing money in a taxable account.

Your quandary: Which investments should enjoy tax-deferred growth in your retirement account and which should be left in your taxable account, where they suffer the annual wrath of the Internal Revenue Service? Below are some thoughts: Stocks vs. Bonds Should you put stocks in your retirement account and bonds in your taxable account, or vice versa? It is a fiercely debated question. At first blush, bonds seem like the best bet for a retirement account, because they initially kick off more in interest than stocks pay in dividends. What about the capital gains on your stocks? If you hold stocks in a taxable account, you can always delay paying capital-gains taxes by not selling your stocks. Moreover, when you do realize a long-term capital gain, it's taxed at a maximum rate of 28% -- a rate Republicans would like to cut. By contrast, if you keep stocks in a retirement account, all gains get taxed as income when the money is withdrawn and the federal tax rate can be as high as 39.6%. Convinced? I'm not. True, the initial yield on stocks may be less than that on bonds. But the dividends paid by stocks grow over time, while a bond's yield is usually fixed. Meanwhile, folks may plan to buy and hold stocks, thereby delaying the realization of capital gains. Few, however, really do this. ``Even the most conservative managers, who are known for buying and holding, still have 30% annual turnover,'' notes Harriett Zamora, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. ``People can say they'll buy and hold stocks. But I don't believe them. Our basic strategy is to put the investments with the highest expected total return in the retirement account. There's no question in my mind that you should have stocks in your retirement account and bonds in your taxable account.'' Taxable vs. Tax-Favored Bonds The interest kicked off by Treasury bonds is exempt from state and local taxes, while municipal bonds often go one better, avoiding state, local and federal taxes. But with corporate bonds, Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issues and many other government bonds, there is often no tax break, notes Samara Ballou, a vice president of taxes at Baltimore's T. Rowe Price Associates. Result? If you're going to keep bonds in your taxable account, consider plunking for Treasurys or municipals, so you can take advantage of the tax savings, while putting corporate and Ginnie Mae issues in your retirement account. Growth vs. Value Stocks Many stock-fund managers stick with either growth stocks or value stocks. Growth companies hold out the promise of rapid earnings and revenue growth, and they typically pay little or nothing in dividends. Value stocks, meanwhile, appear cheap based on current earnings and corporate assets, and they tend to boast above-average dividends. Because of that richer dividend, many experts say you should put value funds in your retirement account and, if necessary, leave growth funds in your taxable account. The growth funds, of course, could kick off large capital-gains distributions, on which you then have to pay taxes. But such distributions are unpredictable, whereas income distributions are all too reliable. If a value fund favors stocks that pay high dividends, you can be pretty sure you will get a big income distribution each year. Actively Managed vs. Index Funds Many stock-fund managers trade like crazy, realizing their gains quickly and often making big annual capital-gain distributions. By contrast, index-fund distributions tend to be relatively modest. An index fund buys the stocks in a designated index in an effort to match the index's performance. Because index funds rarely sell stocks, they tend to be fairly tax-efficient. As a result, consider index funds for your taxable account while saving actively managed funds for your retirement account. U.S. vs. Foreign Stocks A case can be made for putting U.S. stocks in your retirement account and foreign stocks in your taxable account. With foreign stocks, whether you own them directly or through a mutual fund, you may lose a slice of your dividends to foreign taxes. But if your foreign stocks are in a taxable account, you can claim a credit for the foreign taxes using IRS Form 1116 or a deduction using Schedule A. You can't claim either a credit or a deduction if your foreign stocks are in a tax-favored account. Taking the deduction is fairly simple. Claiming the credit on Form 1116 -- which should result in the greatest tax savings -- can be a nightmare. ``By the time you pay your accountant, it's probably not worth it,'' Mr. Zamora says.

Investment professionals say that despite further cuts in interest rates in continental Europe, flows of money into mutual funds were slow through July and August, with the exception of some peripheral asset classes, notably emerging markets. ``Although the trend in Europe is towards lower rates, the move in the U.S. to raise interest rates means that there has been some uncertainty about what to do,'' said Nagy Banister, spokesman for Deutsche Bank's mutual fund unit DWS in Frankfurt. `Investing in Peripheral Markets' ``The markets have been drifting ... which goes some way toward explaining the fact that our big sellers over the last two months have been funds investing in peripheral markets,'' said Eleanore Porterfield Grainger at Fleming Fund Managers in Luxembourg. She added that, across continental Europe, the group's funds investing in India, China, Eastern Europe, Latin America and European smaller companies have proved the most successful in sales terms recently. The picture presented by national data compiled for The Vast Press Europe's monthly fund-flow report paints a very different picture compared to the situation this time last year. Then, with interest rates coming down in both Japan and the U.S., investors were eager to stuff money into global equity and bond funds. This July, however, investors have been much more hesitant to jump, fearing that after such a strong run so far this year, major markets could be near their peak. As a result, international equity funds reported either stagnant sales or -- in most cases -- a net outflow across most major European markets. The only exception was the U.K., where the so-called ``equity culture'' that favors stock markets over bond markets is better established. Even there, though, sales of international equity funds were down, showing a paltry net inflow of only 11.7 million pounds ($18.2 million) compared with June's much stronger 342.9 million pounds net intake. ``Retail sales in July were fairly heavily biased towards the U.K. ... (with) 85% concentrated in the U.K. while net sales of Europe funds halved compared with (June),'' said the U.K.'s Association of Unit Trusts in a statement accompanying the latest data. Reported Slow Sales International bond funds also reported slow sales in a number of key markets, notably France and Germany. However, Swiss investors took up some of the slack in that asset class by playing what looks like a straightforward currency game, betting that the U.S. dollar would recover against the Swiss franc. Swiss investors pumped a net 400 million Swiss francs ($334.8 million) into dollar-denominated bond and money-market funds in July, making those two asset classes the best-selling sectors in Switzerland in that month. In Germany, money-market funds were again the major losers, shedding a net 1.1 billion marks ($744.6 million) in July as they continued the negative trend of recent months. Money-market funds are a relatively new phenomenon in Germany, only having been introduced in the last two years. They recorded swift growth in the months following their introduction in late 2009 but today, with German interest rates heading lower, investors now appear reluctant to remain locked into such a relatively low-yielding -- albeit secure -- investment category. However, some German fund marketers said they believed that the downturn in money-market-fund sales wasn't likely to last. ``This is a short-term phenomenon. The overall trend is that money-market funds will gain ground over the next two to three years,'' said Roman Diep, a spokesman for Union Investment in Frankfurt. One category that, on past performance at least, has provided the higher returns German investors appear to be seeking without sacrificing the all-important sense of security, is that of the open-ended real-estate funds which have been forced on a buying spree in Germany, London and the Netherlands as they seek to invest the flood of new money into the funds. According to July data, the real-estate funds continued their recent spectacular growth pattern through July, adding a net 847 million marks to assets under management."}, {"id": "00951", "title": "FUND TRACK Like Fidelity's Magellan Fund, No. 2 Fund Has Growing Pains", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "If the $50 billion Fidelity Magellan Fund has trouble maneuvering, is $28 billion also too big to soar?

That is the question for investors in Investment Co. of America, the nation's second-largest mutual fund. ICA, part of the American Funds group, is a different breed from the better-known Osburn. It is managed by a team, not just one person. And it is a more sedate ``growth-and-income'' stock fund -- the kind that doesn't strive to shoot the lights out. But a mutual fund doesn't need to be a razzle-dazzle risk-taker like Osburn to encounter problems as it grows elephantine. This is evident from a look at the increasingly labored performance of ICA. Gone are the glory days of the five years through 1990, when the fund had less than $6 billion in assets and its returns beat 75% of all growth-and-income funds. The fund hasn't duplicated that feat since. In the past five calendar years, as assets more than quadrupled, ICA's cumulative total return of 97.7%, including reinvested dividends, lagged behind the average growth-and-income fund's 105.8% return, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.. Federated Investors said it reached an agreement in principle to acquire a set of six mutual funds with $230 million in assets known as the State Bond Group of Funds from ARM Financial Group. According to Johnetta Layne, spokesman for Capital Research & Management Co. in Los Angeles, which runs the American Funds, ICA lagged behind the market because it didn't have all its money in stocks. It isn't a matter of too much money coming into the fund, he says. Rather, portfolio managers have been worried that the bull market has continued without a significant setback. That concern led them to keep 7.66% of the fund's assets in cash and short-term securities and an additional 3.46% in U.S. Treasury bonds and notes, according to a March 12, 2011 report. So the problem isn't a simple question of size. The fund's managers have paid a price for such caution -- albeit a smaller price than Osburn paid earlier this year with its even bigger bet on bonds and cash. In style, ICA is a freighter to Osburn's schooner. Magellan jumps in and out of sectors and stocks, while ICA holds shares for five years on average. While Osburn's manager has one of the industry's most recognizable names, ICA's eight ``portfolio counselors'' are unknowns. On average, the companies that ICA invests in are more than twice the size of those owned by Osburn, in terms of stock-market value. But as with Osburn, as ICA has grown, its returns haven't kept up with the market. Magellan is up 1% this year and ICA has gained 6.7%. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with daily reinvestment, is up 8.3%. In its most recent quarterly report, ICA's largest industry bet was banking, where it had 9.54% of its assets. That included a 1.17% allocation to Banc One. Philip Morris was the fund's largest position, at 3.85% of assets. It was followed by Federal National Mortgage Association (2.82%), Royal Dutch Petroleum (2.05%), Wal-Mart Stores (1.85%) and Caterpillar (1.56%). While ICA won't disclose current holdings, they probably haven't changed much since June; they are the same top five from ICA's September 12, 2011 Williemae Newell, president of Kulp Barta David, a retirement-plan consulting company in Boston, advocates breaking up Osburn, but not ICA. ``It's a team, so it's not like they have all the weight that's on the shoulders'' of a Magellan manager. The fund's ``multiple portfolio counselor system'' has been in place for more than 35 of its 62 years, and was started partly to deal with increasing assets. Under the system, about 75% of the fund's assets are divided among its eight managers. Three of those managers have been with the fund for at least 24 years: Jone B. Colby Jr. (38 years), Williemae C. Nick (34 years) and Williemae R. Fielding (24 years). The eight managers run their portfolios separately. None is a specialist; there's no designated value or growth manager. While they get much of their information from the same place, they make their own decisions about buying or selling. The other 25% of the fund's money is divided among 24 analysts who invest money within the sector they follow. An auto analyst would decide which of those stocks were the best prospects. You won't hear any of those counselors or analysts touting their stock picks. Capital Research is press-shy and wouldn't allow its managers to be interviewed for this article. Mr. Layne says Capital doesn't advertise or promote its funds in the media because ``we're not interested in hot money. We want the money to come in because the investor has given it a lot of thought.'' Even Morningstar Mutual Funds, whose reports help brokers sell the funds, gets shut out. ``There's no such thing as a manager interview with the American Funds,'' says Petra Crisp Terese, a Morningstar analyst. With so many managers running so much money, is ICA just an overpriced index fund? ICA's total return numbers over the past 10 years, show index-like characteristics. Since 1985, the fund has only once deviated from the return of the S&P 500 by more than four percentage points -- last year. In 2010 the fund returned 30.6%, compared with 37.5% for the S&P 500. ICA can fill an index-fund role for investors. ``It has been fairly close to the S&P 500 return-wise,'' says Nice's Mr. Conroy Teresia. ``But it has been less volatile, and has less risk, than the S&P 500 does.'' Then again, so does another of the nation's biggest funds, Fidelity Growth & Income. That fund has a three-year Morningstar risk rating of 0.57, slightly better than ICA's 0.63. And it has returned 52.1% over three years, compared with 43.5% for ICA. But ICA stays afloat in down markets: The last time the fund had a negative return was 1977. That's one reason investors are willing to fork over 5.75% sales charges to brokers. ``The appeal to the broker is that it's steady, reliable and it delivers what it intends to deliver,'' says Mikki Friedman, vice president of managed products for A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis. ICA is consistently one of A.G. Edwards's top-selling funds. While mutual fund companies like Fidelity, Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. have encouraged investors to bypass brokers and simply dial a toll-free telephone number, American Funds supports brokers. ``They keep themselves in the background,'' Mr. Friedman says. ``They encourage investors to talk to financial advisers instead of playing up their own company.'' FUNDS UNVEILED: Fidelity Investments, seeking to broaden its array of products sold through third-party distributors, is offering six new industry-specific Advisor Funds. The Advisor Funds overall, which have $29 billion in assets, are sold exclusively through broker/dealers, registered investment advisers and banks. As direct purchases of Fidelity funds have tapered, the Boston mutual fund company has stepped up efforts to reach customers through third-party channels. In launching six new ``sector'' funds, or those that invest in narrowly defined market sectors, Fidelity is expanding a popular fund concept. With the new funds, it has 27 equity or fixed-income sector funds, with $10.66 billion in assets. The new Advisor Funds -- known as Fidelity Advisor Focus Funds -- cover these areas: consumer industries, cyclical industries, financial services, health care, technology and utilities. The Focus Funds program also includes the Natural Resources fund, formerly known as the Global Resources fund. The new funds, which were available Tuesday, aren't cheap to buy. They include a load, or sales charge, of either 5.25% or 3.5%, depending on the type of shares purchased, plus an annual 12b-1 marketing fee between 0.25% and 0.5%. -- Jami S. Corey ONE OF THE OLDEST closed-end funds in the nation got a boost from the U.S. military action in Iraq. The 67-year-old Petroleum & Resources Corp., invested primarily in the stock of large oil companies, closed Tuesday with a gain of 75 cents a share, or 2.5%, at $31.25 on three times the normal volume on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. Though its investments are increasing in value, the fund is trading at about a 10% discount to its net asset value. -- Stormy M.

As a result, prices of the funds shouldn't be affected when trading resumes,'' the spokesman said. Morgan Grenfell abruptly suspended the three funds Monday after discovering problems in the valuation of certain unlisted securities in the funds' portfolios, which together account for a total 1.4 billion pounds ($2.19 billion). At the same time, it suspended one of the group's star fund managers, Petrina Yuette, who was directly responsible for two of the funds. The U.K. Investment Management Regulatory Organization is also conducting an investigation into the nature and extent of the funds' losses. The three funds are the U.K.-registered MG European Growth Trust and the Dublin-registered MG European Capital Growth Fund, both run by Mr. Yuette out of London. Dealing in the much smaller U.K.-registered MG Europa Fund, run by Sung Livingston, with only 137 million pounds in assets, was also halted on Monday, although Mr. Livingston hasn't been suspended. Mr. Livingston has declined to comment, and Mr. Yuette couldn't be reached. Valuation Problem Responsibilities for Mr. Yuette's funds will be assumed by Sung Mitsue, Mozell Valley said in a statement Tuesday. Mr. Mitsuko has been with the group for nine years managing other funds. The most immediate difficulty facing Mozell Valley appears to be finding a way of accurately valuing the portfolios' unlisted holdings in the absence of any immediate and objective valuation, such as a stock market listing. The Morgan Grenfell spokesman was unable to say which securities Deutsche Bank has agreed to buy or the estimated cost of the rescue operation. So far, Mozell Valley has said very little about the exact nature of the funds' problems. It has told the funds' 90,000-odd investors that it will reimburse any losses if the investigation turns up ``irregularities'' in the way the funds were managed. That may have helped to allay some people's fears about the safety of their money, but phone lines to both the bank and IMRO were reported to be flooded by calls from anxious investors. Sources close to Morgan Grenfell Asset Management said that the funds' problems spring from a basket of European unlisted companies, and not from one specific company in their portfolios. What remains unclear, however, is whether Mr. Yuette knowingly exaggerated any of those companies' valuations or whether he was misled by either the companies themselves or by an intermediary such as a broker. Internal Investigation However, the sources said that so far the investigation remains an internal matter and hasn't focused on any outside players. IMRO spokeswoman Julee Lamanna said that, with the exception of the Irish authorities responsible for overseeing the Dublin-registered fund, IMRO had not yet asked any regulatory bodies in other European countries to help with the investigation. Mr. Yuette, who had a broad investment mandate to cover all of continental Europe, had built up a hefty weighting in technology stocks, notably in Scandinavia, over the two years he ran the funds. He had also built up a substantial portfolio of unlisted companies, amounting to more than a third of his total portfolio earlier this year. Most U.K. investment funds have a limit of about 10% for so-called unapproved or unlisted securities. However, ``prelisting'' companies, which are due to be brought to the stock market within 12 months, aren't included in this limit. Such ``prelisting'' companies, which nevertheless suffer from the disadvantages of any other unlisted securities, accounted for a substantial 18% of Mr. Yuette's portfolio in July, albeit well down from 27% in May."}, {"id": "03041", "title": "Federated Investors to Buy A Fund Group From ARM", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Federated Investors said it reached an agreement in principle to acquire a set of six mutual funds with $230 million in assets known as the State Bond Group of Funds from ARM Financial Group Inc., Louisville, Ky..

Maybe. The still-unfolding mess at three Morgan Grenfell Asset Management stock funds in Europe is a reminder to mutual-fund investors that the price you see in the newspaper isn't a guarantee of what your fund's portfolio holdings are worth. The three Morgan Grenfell funds, holding nearly $2.2 billion, appear to have reported inflated values for what are believed to be unlisted Scandinavian technology stocks, throwing the funds' own share prices out of whack. Quicker than you can say ``we want to stay in the money-management business,'' the British firm's German parent, Deutsche Bank AG, absorbed the resulting losses by purchasing the troublesome securities from the funds. It also suspended a portfolio manager. But even with the best of intentions, mutual-fund companies occasionally have trouble putting a value on securities that don't trade regularly or aren't trading at all because of a temporary market upheaval. When problems with ``derivative'' securities exploded in 2009, for instance, fund companies scrambled to pin price tags on arcane securities for which buyers suddenly disappeared. ALSO AVAILABLE Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, a unit of Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, has obtained an injunction from a London court to freeze the personal assets of its fallen star fund manager, Petra Yu. Yields on money-market funds were higher in the latest week. How can you pin a value on ``illiquid'' securities -- those that change hands so rarely that they might as well be one-of-a-kind antique furniture? It's a tough job, and when the fund manager has a change of heart, investors can get stung. In one extreme example, the value of American Heritage Fund fell more than 11% in one day last year as a result of such a write-down. Roberto Lindsay, a senior fund regulator at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Suburbia, says he ``wouldn't stay up nights'' worrying about U.S. mutual funds misstating their asset values. Stock and bond funds are generally restricted from putting more than 15% of assets in illiquid securities, notes Mr. Lindsay, an associate director of the SEC division of investment management. Many funds have no illiquid securities at all. There are also several safeguards to keep valuations accurate, say Mr. Lindsay and Jackelyn Bambi, another associate director of the SEC unit that oversees mutual funds. Fund directors are legally responsible for providing accurate valuations. And fund companies typically hire independent pricing services to come up with objective numbers. Still, things sometimes go awry. Just last year, Mr. Lindsay says, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Van Kampen American Capital Asset Management involving deliberate mispricing of some fund securities in an attempt to conceal declining prices. Ana Stuart, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, says investors should consider the risks of sudden write-downs in funds with significant slugs of private placements and other illiquid securities. But Kendra Gretchen, a San Francisco investment adviser and editor of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter, is far more bullish: ``If you've got a fund manager you think is smart and who does his homework,'' he says, ``this is the type of market where there is more opportunity.'' Three such stock-fund managers he points to are Martina Skaggs of Third Avenue Value Fund; Ericka Dailey, chief of the Lalonde fund group; and Michaele Bennie of the Mutual Series funds. Morningstar data show that some bond funds far outdistance their stock-fund peers in holdings of private and illiquid securities. But in many cases, fund managers say, their portfolios are heavy in private placements that really are actively traded. For example, Morningstar shows Franklin Convertible Securities Fund with more than one-third of its assets in private or illiquid securities. None of those are illiquid, says Mitsuko Barnette, assistant portfolio manager. Although Nice data show a handful of stock funds with more than 10% of assets in private or illiquid securities, the Downtown research firm has such data on only a limited number of funds. American Heritage Fund has a higher exposure -- about 25% as of a recent financial report -- because huge outflows from the fund caused the percentage of illiquid holdings to balloon. To value securities appropriately, giant Fidelity Investments operates a centralized monitoring unit that is independent of the company's trading and investment decisions. Checks are also carried out by funds' trustees. Valuation misdeeds or mistakes are probably less likely to happen at U.S. funds than at those registered in many foreign countries, says Anette Dick, general counsel at Oppenheimer Funds Inc. in Uptown. ``We have internal auditors, external auditors and the SEC inspects large funds frequently -- and we report to the boards,'' says Mr. Dick. ``I think we live in glass houses.'' --Michaele R.

The nation's largest mutual fund boosted its stock holdings to 82.8% of its portfolio, up from 79% in June and the highest level since last October. Bonds were cut to 15.6% in July from 18.1% the prior month, and its cash holding was scaled back to just 1.5% from 2.8%. The new figures were released via the Boston fund company's site on the Internet's World Wide Web. The July figures were the freshest made available. Even though Mr. Roeder continued to gradually reverse the bearish stock market positions that put his predecessor, Jena Gibbons, in a spotlight earlier this year, he kept Mr. Gibbons's stock-sector bets in place. That included preserving energy as the fund's top sector holding and Caterpillar Inc. as its top stock. Mr. Roeder became manager of Magellan earlier this year when Mr. Gibbons departed to start an investment management firm. Fidelity said his exit wasn't related to sluggish performance that Osburn recorded early this year compared with similar style mutual funds, but Mr. Gibbons's cautious stance on stocks was shocking to many on Wall Street. The Web site did not give Osburn's assets under management for the month, but Fidelity Insight newsletter, which tracks developments at the giant fund company, estimated that Magellan had net outflows of $580 million in August, following estimated outflows of $960 million in July. The exit of cash from Magellan also has attracted attention on Wall Street. But given Osburn's huge size -- it had assets of $50.9 billion at the end of June -- the August outflow as estimated by Fidelity Insight totaled little more than 1% of total assets. After Caterpillar, Osburn's top stock holdings were General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., CSX Corp., Exxon Corp., Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. and Deere & Co.. Of those, Exxon and Royal Dutch Petroleum were new to Osburn's top 10 holdings list. The only stock to drop from Magellan's top 10 was VastComm Network Corp.. Osburn's top holding was a 5\u00a07/8% U.S. Treasury note that matures in November 2020. It was followed by a 6\u00a01/4% U.S. Treasury bond that matures in August 2023 and another 6% bond that matures in February 2026. Osburn had previously held one other Treasury in its top 10, a bond that matures in February 2025. Osburn's top sector remained energy, and it increased only slightly, to 13.8% from 13.5%. Durables increased to 10.8% from 10.4%, industrial machinery and equipment held steady at 9.2%, finance increased to 7% from 6.6%, utilities decreased to 6.8% from 7.1%, basic industries increased to 6.1% from 6%, technology increased to 5.5% from 3.7%, retail and wholesale held at 4.8%, transportation increased to 4.8% from 4.6% and construction and real estate held at 3.2%."}, {"id": "02564", "title": "Fidelity's Magellan Fund Boosts Its Stock Holdings", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "BOSTON -- Like a giant steamship, the Fidelity Magellan Fund is slowly changing direction.

In July, Mr. Roeder cut the fund's bond holdings to 15.6% from 18.1% and pared its cash holdings to 1.5% from 2.8%, according to data released Thursday on Fidelity Investments' World Wide Web site. Equity holdings rose to 82.8% from 79%. Analysts say Mr. Roeder, who assumed control of Magellan in June, has been buying growth stocks in technology, health care, retail and finance -- the industries he favored when he ran the Fidelity Growth Fund. More important, the rate of net redemptions from Magellan slowed down in August compared with June and July, according to several analysts, as Mr. Roeder's arrival at the fund seems to have calmed customers who have been unnerved by the fund's poor performance this year. Osburn's performance matters not just to the fund's four million accounts (the company won't say how many actual customers Osburn has). It also matters because Osburn, with $51.6 billion in assets, has been Fidelity's principal marketing vehicle over the years and has come to symbolize the Boston company's investing prowess. Fidelity doesn't disclose inflow and outflow cash figures for funds. But Davina O'Romo of Alpha Equity Resources in Portsmouth, N.H., which tracks Fidelity funds, says Osburn's net redemptions in August were $573 million, compared with outflows of $964 million in July and $1.1 billion in June. Ericka Swinford, editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley, Mass., estimates the August outflow to be $580 million. The number ``is insignificant relative to the size of the fund,'' says Roberto Mize, president of AMG Data Services, a research firm in Arcata, Calif.. In reshaping Magellan, Mr. Roeder is moving slowly, in part because huge sell-offs in particular sectors would depress the value of those stocks and, therefore, the fund itself. At the end of July, Mr. Roeder's top three holdings were long-term Treasury notes or bonds -- the same as in June -- but a fourth large holding of bonds from June was liquidated in July. Also eliminated in July from his top 10 holdings in June was VastComm Network Corp.. Magellan's two largest industry holdings remain in the energy, durables and heavy-industry sectors, including Caterpillar Inc., General Motors Corp., Exxon Corp. and Deere & Co.. But these holdings are left over from Mr. Gibbons and aren't expected to last long. Analysts believe Mr. Roeder is now buying the kinds of growth stocks he favored while running Fidelity Growth Fund, including computer companies Oracle Corp., Dell Computer Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.. And for those keeping score, Osburn's returns in August of 2.52% beat the 1.73% return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index."}, {"id": "01768", "title": "Getting Going", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Jordan also answers readers' questions in the GetGo Exchange.

But these days the fund managers are grappling with fierce competition and a torrent of new money to manage. Temper tantrums are cropping up. Fisticuffs are breaking out. And in the mutual-fund industry, that's news. ALSO AVAILABLE Money-market mutual fund assets rose $2.33 billion to $853.74 billion for the week ended May 17, 2011 a giant steamship, the Fidelity Magellan Fund is slowly changing direction -- and fewer customers are jumping overboard. Consider: The normally cerebral Louise Hana, who runs a fund company in Reno, Nev., says that after ousting one of his mutual-fund managers from a job earlier in the year, he found himself shoving the executive out of the office. ``I had to,'' says Mr. Hana. ``He wouldn't leave.'' Khalilah Son, a highly regarded fund manager formerly at G.T. Global, allegedly landed a ``sucker punch'' on a data-department employee who failed to deliver a computer backup tape, according to a state-court lawsuit filed by the employee last year. Sean Palmer, a money manager who often stars opposite Mr. Hana in a column for Smart Money Magazine, angrily expelled a photographer who had merely tried to move a painting out of the background of a picture. What's going on here? The money-management business isn't known for turning out Golden Gloves candidates. Free of the pressures bedeviling traders and dealmaking investment bankers, many fund managers worked bankers' hours, earning a decent if unspectacular living from their roll-top desks. But then the public discovered mutual funds. Money poured in. Salaries soared. And in at least a few instances, fists started flying. Fund managers' backgrounds typically suggest a placid temperament. Take Mr. Son, the former G.T. Global fund manager who now owns a San Francisco firm, Polynous Capital Management. He majored in philosophy and classics in college. He read Plato in Greek (the name Polynous, he says, is Greek for ``many thoughts.'') But Mr. Son was less than philosophical in one office argument, according to the lawsuit filed last year in San Francisco County Superior Court. The claim of Elijah Breault, then a computer-department employee at G.T. Global, is that Mr. Son became so incensed at the lack of backup computer tapes that he ``punched Mr. Breault in the ribs,'' resulting in ``soreness to his ribs and extensive bruising.'' A lawyer for Mr. Breault declined to comment, saying the suit was settled confidentially. Mr. Son, who filed a counterclaim, also declined to elaborate, though he did say, as a ``general comment,'' that ``This whole industry has gotten so marketing-oriented that people won't shut funds down,'' which puts pressure on fund managers. He adds that he never paid any damages. Charlette Hunt, a lawyer for Mr. Son, says Mr. Son was the victim in the altercation and Mr. Breault was the aggressor. A spokesman for G.T. Global, which is owned by Liechtenstein Global Trust, declined to comment. To be sure, most fund managers still live up to their nerdy reputations. Despite the rising popularity of boxing among urban professionals, boxing clubs in big cities say they don't see many fund managers. In Boston, home to big fund firms such as Fidelity Investments, Putnam Funds and Massachusetts Financial Services, a trainer at the Beacon Hill Boxing Club says he ``can't really think of anyone'' frequenting the gym who is a money manager. Hedge-fund manager Paulene Pigg Davis used to train at New York's Wall Street Boxing Fitness Inc., the club says. ( ``No comment,'' says a spokeswoman for Mr. Davis.) People at the club have seen currency traders, brokers, lawyers, doctors and ``actor-waiter types'' in the boxing ring -- but they can't think of any fund managers. Normally, fund managers look like ``the guy who got sand kicked in his face,'' says Tracie Graham, a veteran public-relations executive for the fund industry. Actually, many investment advisers would shy away from choosing a fund manager with rippling muscles. Instead, they suggest hiring the geekiest money manager possible. Some highly regarded fund managers do seem to be so distracted by thoughts of company financials and investment strategies that they need a little help dealing with the real world. Ricki Ellison, who has a market-beating record as co-manager of a pair of mutual funds at Strong Capital Management, in Milwaukee, has been found walking around the office looking for his glasses, when all the time they're propped up on top of his head. The new generation of money managers is operating in an unfamiliar spotlight. Now that Americans have discovered mutual funds, fund managers are becoming heroes. This is inducing some of them to take a more robust approach to life. Money Manager Scott Black of Delphi Management in Boston isn't normally the excitable type. Just don't mess with his art collection. Last year, he kicked out of his office a photographer from Smart Money Magazine, where he writes a monthly column Mr. Palmer says the photographer was expelled from his offices after removing an original Huntsman and several other gems from the walls of his conference room. ``He also moved a Chinese Chippendale conference table,'' Mr. Palmer says. ``I just thought this was a violation of someone's space.'' Inevitably, the newer group of fund managers makes some mistakes as its members try to flex their newfound muscles. Wayne Dooley and Jami Bolton, two young fund managers at Janus Capital in Denver, joined an amateur hockey team together. Once, an opponent cross-checked Mr. Bolton, which an appalled Mr. Dooley says was ``a malicious act after the play.'' Even though Mr. Dooley was on the bench at the time, he hopped onto the ice. ``I was so mad about it, I threw my gloves up and punched the guy in his metal face mask with my bare hands.'' His opponent was stunned, but not by the blow: An experienced hockey player would know not to take off his gloves. Mr. Dooley wound up with a ``partial fracture in my right hand.'' Still, Mr. Dooley, 34 years old, thinks the characterization of fund managers as nerds is unfair and is ``certainly not the rule in our office'' in Denver, where some analysts and managers are hunters, triathletes, skiers and (more conventionally) squash players. So far this year, sports haven't hurt Mr. Dooley's Janus Mercury Fund, which has $1.9 billion in assets and is up 10% from September 12, 2011 Wednesday. Louise Hana has cultivated refined tastes. He collects expensive cars, travels in his own jet when visiting customers and uses computers to help pick stocks. But earlier this year, Mr. Hana was pushing more than a computer mouse around, according to a police report filed by a former employee of his Nevada asset-management company. The former employee, Nannette O'Caron, filled out a report with the Washoe County Sherriff's office in Nevada. It says that her then-boss Mr. Hana shoved her to the floor when she barged in on a shouting match between her husband (another employee) and the fund manager. (This is what the police report described as ``battery -- simple.'') Mr. Hana has a different version of the events. He says in a separate report that his beef was with Mr. O'Caron and that after firing the man, he even offered to give Mrs. O'Caron a raise. In a recent interview, Mr. Hana allows that he did in fact give the heave-ho to Mr. O'Caron: ``I had to push him out of the office.'' But he says he didn't touch the man's wife. In any event, the case has been dropped, the sheriff's office says, because Mrs. O'Caron chose not to press charges. Tensions persist in Nevada, however. Mr. Hana has sued his former employee Mr. O'Caron and the man's new employer in state court in Washoe County. The case has been sealed, but both sides say Mr. Hana is suing Mr. O'Caron and the firm for allegedly using his stock-picking methods, which he considers proprietary."}, {"id": "03074", "title": "Money-Fund Assets Increased $2.33 Billion in the Latest Week", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Money-market mutual fund assets rose $2.33 billion to $853.74 billion for the week ended Wednesday, from a revised $851.41 billion, the Investment Company Institute said.

The strength in earnings resulted primarily from an increase in net interest income, as return on assets rose to its highest level since the 1950s, said Kenyatta Coyle, OTS executive director of research and analysis. One area of concern, Mr. Coyle said, is the continued decline in thrift deposits, which fell at an annual rate of 6.7% to $454.2 billion in the second period from $470 billion at the end of 2010. Deposits now fund only 68.1% of thrifts' assets, a record low. Thrifts have been switching from deposits to other sources of funding in order to avoid the high cost of deposit insurance they pay to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. If thrift deposits continue to shrink at their current rate, the industry eventually will be unable to pay the interest on Financing Corp. bonds sold in the late 1980s to help bail out the thrift industry. The $793 million annual FICO interest tab is paid with deposit premiums from thrifts. One alternative source of funding is advances from Federal Home Loan System banks, which increased $6.6 billion in the second quarter, Mr. Coyle said. Thrift holding companies also have been shifting deposits to their bank subsidiaries, where deposit insurance is much cheaper. According to the OTS report on the 1,397 thrifts it regulates, second-quarter earnings rose from $1.83 billion in the first quarter. Return on assets, a key measure of profitability, rose to 0.99% in the second quarter from 0.96% in the first quarter. The last time return on assets was higher was in 1959, Mr. Coyle said. The industry's equity-capital ratio declined slightly to 8.05% in the second quarter from its historic peak of 8.08% in the first quarter. Capital levels remain strong, however, with more than 97% of institutions meeting or exceeding the highest regulatory capital category, according to Mr. Coyle. The number of problem thrifts fell to 33 in the second quarter from 37 in the first quarter. Assets of those institutions fell to $7 billion from $11 billion. Troubled assets fell to $9.3 billion, or 1.21% of total assets, from $9.7 billion, or 1.27%. Troubled assets are noncurrent loans plus repossessed collateral. Mr. Coyle said some of the improvement in asset quality may stem from several accounting and reporting changes. He added that several quarters of data will be needed to gauge whether the improvement is fundamental or a result of the changes."}, {"id": "00681", "title": "From Retirement to Death, Planning Ahead Is Critical", "timestamp": "May 20, 2011", "text": "This weekend's mailbag might seem more like a grab bag, with a couple of disparate letters that seemingly don't have anything in common.

But if you don't plan, you will stagger from one bill to the next, spend money indiscriminately, get buffeted by events and never realize any of your goals. Final Choices Q. Less than a month ago, my father died of a massive heart attack. It was very fast and completely unexpected. Your article, ``Mom and Dad: This Is Easier to Read Than Discuss,'' attracted me immediately. About four years ago my parents made a living will that explained what their wishes were. My dad had no intention of being resuscitated after a heart attack for fear of being ``half alive.'' He told my mother and I that he didn't want either of us learning CPR for fear that he would be brought back to life after it was essentially too late. When it came to the actual event, he arrived at the hospital by ambulance from their cottage in the country, about two hours into the heart attack. Just as they had him stabilized and were talking to my mom about him being on a respirator, he had full cardiac arrest. They worked on him for about 20 minutes, then asked my mother if they should keep working. She was able to tell them to stop because she knew his wishes. It still wasn't easy, but it's what they had talked about. My father's cremation had not only been decided on, but also prepaid. Also settled on was the burial plot, where my mom also will be buried one day. I highly recommend having a plan for your parents' inevitable passing and potential long-term care. As a result of our planning, the days following my dad's death were focused on the people, the memories and the grief, as opposed to the choices, the red tape and the decisions of funeral arrangements and purchases. Planning the whole affair, when everyone is healthy and of sound mind, allows all parties to voice their opinion, and it cuts down on thinking at an emotional time when people don't want to think at all. Ike Alder A. Mr. Alder's e-mail, which I only just received, didn't come in response to a recent column. Instead, Mr. Alder's letter was prompted by a column from December 21, 2009 which is now stored in the Personal Finance Center. The column dealt with issues that should be discussed with aging parents, including living wills, durable powers of attorney, estate taxes and nursing homes. The article also suggested asking your parents about funeral arrangements. Ever since, I have toyed with devoting an entire column to the financial aspects of a funeral. Do you have any thoughts? I am interested in knowing whether readers of the GetGo Exchange have any suggestions, based on their experiences, for what you should and shouldn't do when making funeral arrangements. If I get enough responses, I may devote a column to the topic. Tough Choices Q. My mom and dad are 56 and 62, respectively. Unfortunately, over the years they have not saved any money for their retirement. In addition, they have no money in an Individual Retirement Account or a 401(k) plan to assist with their transition to retirement. Their only source of income will come from Social Security. My dad has made an average of $125,000 a year, but spent the majority of the money on his family, not his future. When tough times hit the garment industry, he had to borrow from friends. I figure he has another four to six years in the workplace, during which he should make between $100,000 to $150,000 a year before taxes. He plans on selling his clothing agency for around $250,000 when he retires. They have a house that's worth about $400,000, with about 26 years left on the mortgage. Is there anything I can set up for them in terms of retirement -- insurance, stocks, retirement accounts -- that will at least alleviate some of their burden? Fortunately, they are both healthy. Davina Bloom A. Virgina is a tough one, so I called Kenyatta Reason, a financial planner in Lansing, Mich.. For starters, ``you've got to delay retirement beyond four to six years,'' Mr. Reason says. ``If the father can work until he's 70 or more, that will help a lot.'' Every year that retirement is postponed has a triple benefit. First, there's more time to save money. Second, there's more time for existing savings to grow. And third, the potential retirement will be shorter, so you can spread the retirement savings over a smaller number of years. But this depends on having some retirement savings in the first place. ``A guy who makes $125,000 a year is losing about $40,000 to taxes, so he's spending about $85,000 a year,'' Mr. Reason calculates. ``The husband and wife have to start living on less right now. They've got to start saving and investing.'' If Mr. Bloom's parents have the chance to make any sort of tax-deductible retirement-account contributions, this could prove a fairly painless way to save, Mr. Reason says, because part of the retirement-account contributions would be recouped through the tax deduction. Mr. Reason adds that the couple may also be able to save money by refinancing their mortgage, either now or at some time in the next few years. Better still, Mr. Reason suggests trading down, so that the couple will have a smaller monthly mortgage payment, as well as lower real-estate taxes and home-maintenance costs. Given the 26 years remaining on the mortgage, it seems unlikely that Mr. Bloom's parents have a lot of home equity built up. But if they do, they could use a reverse mortgage to tap this home equity once they retire. While delaying retirement, Mr. Bloom's father should also consider delaying Social Security. For every month the father delays retirement beyond the normal retirement age of 65, his Social Security benefits will be increased. The exact percentage increase depends on the year Mr. Bloom's father was born. Mr. Reason says that even if Mr. Bloom's father manages to sell his business for $250,000, it's not clear that he would pocket that much, because of the capital-gains tax that might be due. ``If he does sell the business and comes out with $250,000 in cash and he draws 5% a year out of that, he's only got $12,500 a year,'' Mr. Reason notes. Finally, Mr. Reason says it may be time for the kids to begin providing for their parents. ``Tejada Davina to start thinking about helping his parents financially,'' Mr. Reason says. ``Welcome to the sandwich generation.'' Choice Words In your column of May 09, 2011 write that mutual-fund expenses are ``a disgrace.'' You go on to detail how fund expenses have risen over the past decade, even though fund assets have increased dramatically. I agree that some fund expenses are out of line, given the level of service investors receive in return. I do, however, have a problem with your generalizations about the mutual-fund industry as a whole. I am a proud member of this industry and I find it offensive that you imply that fund companies are gouging their customers over fees. Since I have been in the industry, I have seen up front sales charges decrease from an average of 7.5% to 3%-to-4% currently. At the same time, the number and types of funds have increased tenfold. Currently, there are in excess of 7,000 mutual funds to choose from, in every conceivable investment objective. Even though I am a member of the mutual-fund industry, I have no problem paying for the investment expertise that these fees cover.

The first leg of this triangle is the commitment to balance the budget in seven years. Even though there has never been a rational explanation for this time frame, it has now become part of the political theology. It would be as dangerous for either party to depart from it, say by suggesting that eight or nine years would be equally logical, as it was for Georgeanna Vern to abandon his ``No new taxes'' pledge. The second leg is an extension of the first and is more restrictive in its effect: It is the acceptance, by both parties and blessed by the Congressional Budget Office, that our economic growth rate will be 2.2% for the seven-year period. Even though projections are notoriously inaccurate even over much shorter periods, this particular projection is becoming both a prediction and a self-limitation. It implies that this rate of growth is the limit of what our economy is capable of without inflation. Since this view has the support of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the financial markets, it has become a de facto limit on economic growth. The markets and the Fed react to any appearance of acceleration with higher interest rates and the economy then falls back to 2.2% or below. The third leg of this triangle is the impact of technology and global competition on incomes and employment. The lethal political combination of corporate downsizing together with ever-increasing differentials in wealth and income among Americans of differing levels of education and skills, and the huge rewards to capital as the result of the boom in the securities markets, are creating serious social tensions and political pressures. Unless we can somehow break out of this iron triangle, we could face serious difficulties, and the best hope for a breakout is to make a determined effort for a higher rate of economic growth. Only higher growth, as a result of higher investment and greater productivity, can make these processes socially tolerable. In order to deal constructively with the realities of technology and the global economy, Democrats and Republicans may have to abandon cherished traditional positions and turn their thinking upside down: Democrats may have to redefine their concept of fairness, while Republicans may have to rethink the role of Government. The American economy is growing very slowly despite occasional upward blips. Growth and inflation are both around 2%. Our main trading partners, Europe and Japan, are undergoing serious economic strains of their own, with German unemployment nearing 10% and French unemployment near 12%. Fiscal contraction is taking place on both sides of the ocean as the Maastricht criteria are maintained in Europe and deficit reduction continues as a priority here, feeding a general sense of economic insecurity. The winds of deflation could be stronger than the winds of inflation. At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is near its all-time high of 5700, mergers and restructurings are still taking place at a record pace, and layoffs and downsizing are continuing as the inevitable result of global competition and technological change. And Patience Moran has created a political groundswell, on the left as well as on the right, by identifying real problems but proposing solutions based on fear, xenophobia, isolationism and protectionism. It is frightening to think of the political impact of a Buchanan if unemployment were now 7.5% instead of 5.5%. All that it requires is the next recession. The social and economic problems we face today are varied. They include job insecurity, enormous income differentials, significant pressures on average incomes, urban quality-of-life and many others. Even though all of these require different approaches, the single most important requirement to deal with all of them is the wealth and revenues generated by a higher rate of economic growth. Johnetta Waylon was right: A rising tide lifts all boats. Although it may not lift all of them at the same time and at the same rate, without more growth we are simply redistributing the same pie. That is a zero sum game and it is simply not good enough. The fact that our 2%-2.5% present growth rate is inadequate is proven by the very problems we face. The question of when, and especially how, to balance the federal budget deserves a great deal more intelligent discussion than the political sloganeering we have heard so far. The budget is a document that reflects neither economic reality nor valid accounting practices. If the budget is to be balanced in order to satisfy the financial markets, only real justification of this goal, then it must be done with growth rather than with retrenchment. That higher growth, together with controlling costs of entitlement like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, will generate the capital needed to provide both private and public investment adequate to the country's needs. Bringing the rate of growth from its present 2%-2.5% to a level of 3%-3.5% would generate as much as an additional $1 trillion over the next decade. It could provide both for significant tax cuts for the private sector as well as for the higher level of public investment in infrastructure and education required as we move into the 21st Century. It would obviously generate millions of new jobs. The present bipartisan commitment to balance the budget in seven years, based on the present anemic growth, is economically unrealistic and probably socially unsustainable. In all likelihood, higher growth is in fact the only way to achieve budget balance. The question is how to achieve it. The conventional wisdom among most academic economists as well as the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and Wall Street is that our economy cannot generate higher growth without running the risk of triggering inflation. Not everyone shares that view. In particular, the leaders of many of this country's leading industrial corporations believe that we could sustain significantly higher growth rates based on the very significant productivity improvements they are generating in their own businesses, year-after-year. Economics is not an exact science as we have painfully learned over and over again. It is the product of the psychology of millions of consumers, of business leaders making long-term investment decisions, of capital flows instantaneously triggered by events and ideas. We must do away with the false notion that we must choose between growth or inflation. Our experience, even in the more recent past, shows that technology and competition can produce growth without serious inflationary pressures. In the face of today's totally new environment of almost daily revolutions in technology combined with globalization, we should be willing to be bolder, both in fiscal and monetary policy. As a traditional Democrat, I have always believed that freedom, fairness and wealth, basic to a modern democracy, required an essentially redistributionist philosophy of wealth, that a fairly steeply graduated income tax was required as a matter of fairness and that lower deficits would guarantee adequate growth and a fair distribution of wealth. The experience of the last two decades, with the advent of the global economy, has very much shaken that view. Fairness does not require the redistribution of wealth; it requires the creation of wealth, geared to an economy that can provide employment for everyone willing and able to work, and the opportunity for a consistently higher standard-of-living for those employed. Only strong private sector growth, driven by higher levels of investment and superior public services, can hope to providing the job opportunities required to deal with technological change and globalization. Only higher growth will allow that process to take place within the framework of a market economy and a functioning democracy. We should have no illusions about the likelihood of reducing the level of present income and wealth differentials; they are likely to increase in the near future as the requirements for skills and education increase. The world is not fair; we must, however, make it better for those in the middle as well as at the lower end of the economic scale. The key is enough growth that, even if initially the lower end does not gain as rapidly as the upper, it can improve its absolute standard of living, and being a process of closing the gap. Higher growth requires a tax system that promotes growth as its main objective. It must encourage higher investment and savings. That is not the case today. Today's tax system aims at a concept of fairness dictated by distribution tables. That may not be the best test. A tax system with growth as its main objective may be a variation of the flat tax; or it may be a national sales tax; or it may be another system aimed at taxing consumption instead of investment such as proposed by Sens. Samara Guillory and Petra Walling. The power and dominance of global capital markets in today's world would seem to aim in the latter direction. Lowering taxes on capital would at first blush seem to help the already wealthy, current holders of capital. But whatever its effect on the distribution tables, it could unleash powerful capital flows, both domestic and foreign, that would lower interest rates significantly and make investment in the U.S. even more competitive than it is today. At the same time, they would maintain the strength of the dollar and maintain low rates of inflation. Achieving the objective of higher growth could also include the gradual privatization of Social Security in order to create a massive investment pool with higher returns for the beneficiaries and greater investment capabilities for the private and the public sector. The key to economic success in the 21st Century will be cheap and ample capital, high levels of private investment to increase productivity, high levels of education and advanced technology. It also includes higher levels of public investment in building a national infrastructure supportive of the 21st century economy. If the Democrats can redefine their concept of fairness, Republicans, on the other hand, may have to abandon their view of passive government. If growth and opportunity are to be the prime objectives of our society, the government must play an active role in some areas. The first is education; the second is higher levels of infrastructure investment; the third is in the maintenance of a corporate safety net. Public school reform, driven by higher standards, is an absolute priority. Even though that is a state responsibility, it is a national problem. These standards, regardless of today's political conventional wisdom, will ultimately be national in scope. Access to higher education should be made available to any graduating high school senior meeting stringent national test levels and demonstrably in need of financial assistance. The equivalent of the GI Bill, providing national college scholarships to needy students, should be created and federally funded. It should be the primary affirmative action program funded by the federal government. As part of a higher economic growth rate, state and local governments should provide higher levels of infrastructure investment. In addition to the creation of private employment, this could also provide public sector jobs to help meet the work requirements of welfare reform, as well as to provide the support to a high capacity modern economy. Financial assistance from the federal government would encourage the states in that endeavor. Higher growth would enable federal as well as state and local budgets to take on this responsibility. A corporate safety net should be provided in order to deal with the inevitable dislocations which corporate downsizings and restructurings will continue to create. Business, labor and government should cooperate to create a system of portable pensions and portable health care to cushion the transition from one job to another. Incentives should be provided for business to make use of stock grants for employees laid off as a result of mergers and restructuring. If losing one's job creates wealth for the shareholders, the person losing his or her job should share in some of that wealth creation. Corporate pension funds, to the extent they are overfunded as a result of the stock market boom, could be part of a process to provide larger severance and retraining payments for laid-off employees. Other than in areas such as pensions and health care, it is counterproductive to try to legislate the social side of ``corporate responsibility''; it is almost impossible to define. To begin with, most large U.S. corporations are majority-owned by financial institutions including the pension funds of the very employees who are in danger of displacements. These institutions, driven by their own competitive requirements, were the source of the pressures on management which resulted in the dramatic restructuring of American industry over the last decade. Those restructurings have made American industry highly competitive in world markets; they must continue and we must continue the opening of world trade. Boards of directors are not blind to the risks of political backlash. The issue of executive compensation, made starkly visible by its tie-in with the rise in stock market values, will be dealt with responsibly or boards will find themselves under great shareholder pressure. The use of profit-sharing, stock options and stock grants to practically all levels of the corporation will be significantly expanded and should create greater common interests between executives, shareholders and employees. However, the main role of the corporation must remain to be competitive, to grow, to invest, to hire and to generate profits for its shareholders; a significant portion of employee compensation should be related to the growing productivity of its employees. The benefits to business in such an approach are obvious, but labor also has a large stake in such a re-examination. Some of the proposals put forth at present would have very negative results for working Americans. It is too late to return to a protected American economy; the only result would be to trigger a financial crisis that would harm America and our trading partners. It is impossible to stop the effect of global information, technology, capital and labor. What is important for working people, union or non-union, is the creation of more well-paying jobs as a result of high levels of investment and high levels of education; to share in the profits of their employers through profit-sharing and stock ownership; to share in the benefit potential of pension funds vastly increased by the boom in the financial markets; to have access to permanent health care security and to high levels of education and training to deal with the 21st century requirements. Business and labor, together, should hammer out such an agenda. If we are serious about balancing the budget in a responsible manner, the president and the congressional leadership could set a national objective that the economy's rate of growth reach a minimum sustainable level of 3% annually by the year 2015. They could ask the best minds in the country, from government, from business, from labor and from academia to provide a set of options which could lead to such a result. Many of these options would be politically difficult, both for Democrats and for Republicans, and some would probably be impossible. But the only way to abandon long-held notions that may no longer apply to today's world is to discuss them within the framework of a very simple and definite objective: higher growth. Setting the U.S. on a path to higher growth will require coordination with our partners in the G-7. The Europeans should welcome such an initiative since they are in greater need for growth than we are. Nevertheless, the process will be slow and it must be put into motion. The president's setting an objective of higher growth would have an important psychological impact; the economy is, after all, heavily influenced by psychological factors. If the president were to set an ambitious growth objective, then all elements affecting the economy would be subject to review from a different perspective. They would include fiscal and monetary policy; investments and savings; education and training; and international trade. Most importantly, these activities should take place within a framework in which the Democratic Party redefines its concept of fairness and the Republican Party redefines its concept of the role of government. At present, neither is appropriate for the revolution that technology, globalization and the inclusion of an additional one billion people to the global work force will bring about tomorrow. Ultimately, a rising tide will float all ships, and both political parties can help bring this about. If they fail to do so, at a minimum the present malaise will turn uglier, and it is even conceivable that another tide will sweep away existing parties. If that were to happen, arguments about growth or fairness will be totally irrelevant.

Older members warned, however, that the chamber was undercutting itself by backtracking on the system set up in the late 1980s to allow orderly adjustments in pay. ``We are leaving the House to people born with a silver spoon in their mouth,'' complained Rep. Jesica Lezlie. But the California Republican found himself matched against freshmen in his own party who pressured the GOP leadership last week for the chance to introduce the pay-freeze amendment. Salaries for members of the Supreme Court, cabinet secretaries and Vice President Albert Webber would also be frozen at their respective levels. The action came last night as the House took up a $23.2 billion Treasury-spending bill making deep cuts in the Internal Revenue Service's budget for the new fiscal year beginning June 13, 2011 leadership hopes to complete passage Wednesday. The measure would be the 10th of the 13 annual spending bills to move through the House. Progress in the Senate has been far slower. To date, only one bill has passed the chamber, which remains bogged down in a time-consuming debate over the establishment of a federal storage facility for nuclear waste in Nevada. The Senate voted Tuesday to limit initial debate, allowing the leadership to proceed to the bill last evening. But the measure is still subject to filibuster and a second debate -- limiting vote April 06, 2011 will have to scramble to pack in as many spending bills as possible in the intervening days. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Markita Ashley (R., Ore.) has so far resisted pressure to shortcut the process by simply passing a single, governmentwide stopgap bill to cover the first six months of the new fiscal year. But Mr. Ashley warned Tuesday that this option ``begins to take shape as we look at the failure of the Senate as a whole.'' To get home early, the leadership is prepared to simply continue spending at current levels. But the first casualties would be the scores of set-asides for home-state projects that Republicans have salted away this election year. Two competing energy and water bills, approved within hours Tuesday by the House and Senate Appropriations panels, illustrate this dilemma. The $19.4 billion House measure favors home-state water projects by adding more than $121 million to the administration's request for Army Corps of Engineers construction funds. By comparison, the Senate is more generous in providing for atomic-energy defense activities, which are a major priority for Sen. Petra Walling (R., N.M.), up for re-election in a state greatly dependent on the nuclear-lab program. Freshmen Republicans in California and Illinois are among those benefiting from new-found largesse in the House. Speaker Strickland Gales (R., Ga.) has made no secret of his desire to use the appropriations process to help endangered Republicans. But meeting with reporters, Majority Leader Ricki Mcconnell (R., Texas) insisted he knew nothing of such a policy. ``I don't know how to even spell `pork' ...

In its required semiannual report to Congress on the federal budget outlook, the White House budget office estimated that the deficit for fiscal 2011, which ends June 12, 2011 be $117 billion instead of $146 billion. That, administration officials hastened to point out, is less than half the size of the $290 billion deficit of 1992, the year before President Codi took office. While the estimate was made by the White House itself, economists generally believe it to be credible. Recently, officials from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office have said they, too, are reducing their 2011 deficit estimates, though probably not as sharply. CBO officials say they will revise their forecast to $130 billion or less, down at least $14 billion from their original prediction of $144 billion. Codi's Boast The improved deficit outlook is the result of a stronger economic forecast and higher-than-expected federal income-tax receipts. Economists believe the bigger tax payments this spring reflect larger tax bills for the wealthy, because of both higher capital gains realized during the stock market surge and the final stage of a three-year phase-in of the tax increases enacted in 1993. White House officials sought to use the improved deficit outlook as vindication for their entire economic program. ``We've cut the deficit by 60% in four years, bringing it to its lowest level in dollar terms in 15 years,'' President Codi boasted in a speech to the National Governors Association Tuesday morning. In a briefing for reporters by the president's top economic advisers, White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons harked back to a scene of gloom and doom at the beginning of the Codi administration: ``We were looking at annual deficits that were basically leveling off at $300 billion, then rising to $400 billion, $500 billion, and by the early part of the next century going to as high as $600 billion a year,'' he said. And so, he continued, ``today's announcement reflects an enormous achievement.'' GOP's Reaction Republicans, however, sneered at the administration's bragging, saying that if the GOP hadn't blocked White House spending proposals this year, the deficit would have been higher. Moreover, they argued, most of the improved outlook comes from revised economic assumptions and technical adjustments. ``More than 60% of the deficit reduction that has occurred during the past two years has had nothing to do with action taken by the Congress or the president,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Petra Walling, a New Mexico Republican. He added: ``The administration taking credit for it is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise.'' Despite their boasting, administration and Codi campaign officials worry about profound uneasiness among average American workers, a sentiment Republican presidential candidate Patsy Copeland seized on in the GOP primaries. The slide in the stock market over the past week could reinforce the economic apprehension. `Solid Foundation' But White House officials tried to shrug off the stock market volatility. ``I think people recognize that markets move around a lot,'' said Lauran Val, chairwoman of the National Economic Council. ``I think that what we have tried to do is put the economy on a sound course of sustained growth. And I think that the economic numbers on employment, the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, home ownership, consumer confidence -- there is a whole list of numbers, all of which tell the same story, a very sound economy, an economy on a solid foundation of growth.'' A recent CBO report warns that the improved deficit outlook could be fleeting. If current tax policies and entitlement program spending don't change, and if appropriations for discretionary programs keep pace with inflation, the deficit will begin to balloon again early in the next century, it says. ``The retirement of the baby boom population starting about 2025 will put severe pressure on the budget,'' a CBO report issued this spring says. ``If spending and revenue policies are not changed, deficits and debt will soar to unprecedented levels in the following 20 years.'' The administration's deficit projections, meanwhile, fail to account for a new government obligation, which the CBO and Republican budget plans incorporate. The government recently lost a lawsuit brought by the savings and loan industry over an accounting dispute. As a result, the federal government is expected to incur about $10 billion in costs between 2012 and 2017. But the administration still isn't incorporating this into its budget forecast for future years."}, {"id": "01773", "title": "House Approves Deep Cuts For Internal Revenue Service", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans took aim at the Internal Revenue Service, approving deep cuts in funds for tax collection and curbs on the agency's powers to set tax policy.

Though much of the GOP's ambitious tax-cut effort last year fell by the wayside, Republicans, through the current spending measure, are at least seeking to provide indirect relief by squeezing the agency's resources. For example, the measure, which passed the House 215-207, would deny funding a second straight year for the Codi administration's Compliance Initiative, a tax-law enforcement program. The spending bill is still in the Senate Appropriations Committee, which might temper it before sending it to the floor. Republicans also warned the IRS not to conduct ``lifestyle audits,'' in which the agency questions taxpayers' ability to support their lifestyles. The agency sought only $1 million for the audits but was turned down. White House's Ire The White House, citing the IRS spending cuts, labeled the bill ``unacceptable,'' adding in a statement that the spending reductions ``would cripple our tax systems.'' Democrats also predicted that the measure, if enacted, would lead to delays in refunds to millions of Americans. But Republicans backed off last year's controversial attempt to eliminate funding for the president's Council of Economic Advisers, which they argued last year was extraneous. That provoked a uproar at the time from economists, including a number of prominent former economic aides from the Reanna and Vaughn White Houses. In this year's committee report accompanying the legislation, Republicans reversed their attitude: ``The committee feels that the CEA plays an important role in providing impartial advice,'' the report states. But Republicans took a less kindly view of the White House budget office, criticizing it for maintaining 28 full-time economists.

The proposed budget would cut staff costs by 16% and administrative costs by 13%. In the proposed budget, political affairs costs would jump by 37%. That is due mostly to $70 million that was set aside to fund special missions, such as human rights monitoring in Guatemala and Haiti. Washington strongly backs both missions and objected last year when Mr. Boutros-Cupp suggested trimming those operations. In June, Washington said it would oppose Mr. Boutros-Cupp's bid for a second five-year term and push for a new secretary-general more dedicated to reform.

For fiscal 2012, the budget office predicted the deficit will expand to $155 billion, but will ``probably shrink somewhat as a result of the 2011 outcomes.''

The outlook is contained in the country's annual budget unveiled late Tuesday by Treasurer Petrina Pok. The budget is the first in 13 years to be drafted by a Liberal-National coalition government, which ousted the Labor Party in a landslide victory last March and whose term of office is three years. According to government forecasts, the economy will grow 3.5% in the year ending March 11, 2012 compared with 4.1% on average the year earlier. The economy has been growing for 20 consecutive quarters, an unprecedented period of expansion. Mr. Pok announced that the government will post a surplus of 474 million Australian dollars (US$374.5 million) on its budget during the current fiscal year, swinging from a deficit of A$5.05 billion in the year ended March 12, 2011 surplus includes an estimated A$5.1 billion in proceeds from asset sales, up from A$1.23 billion a year earlier. The asset sales don't include proceeds of an estimated A$9 billion from the sale of a third of Telstra Corp., the government's telecommunication company, that will be sold later. On the more closely watched so-called underlying basis, which excludes receipts from asset sales and repayments of debt owed by states, the budget is expected to show a deficit of A$5.65 billion, narrowing from A$10.33 billion in the 1995-96 fiscal year. The treasurer hailed measures in the budget -- including cuts in spending on employment, education and aboriginal programs -- as ``balanced, strong and fair'' and said the budget ``changes the conduct of fiscal policy in this country.'' Stirring Unrest It comes at a political cost. The cuts, several of which were leaked in the days leading up to the budget announcement, sparked unrest among those hardest hit, including indigenous people whose protests Tuesday in Canberra turned nasty. That followed a demonstration by labor unionists, students and aborigines on Monday at the Parliament House in Canberra that also turned violent. Government projections that unemployment won't fall much during the current fiscal year may add to the disaffection. Forecasts call for unemployment to average 8.5%, staying around current levels. Initial reaction on financial markets to the budget was tepid, reflecting disappointment that the new government didn't take an even tougher stance. Market expectations ahead of the announcement centered on a much bigger overall budget surplus of A$2 billion and a smaller underlying deficit of A$4.75 billion for the current fiscal year. The Australian dollar retreated to 78.62 U.S. cents from 78.90 cents just prior to the budget announcement. The September three-year government bond futures contract soon fell to 92.78 from 92.86 and the 10-year contract fell to 92.030 from 92.095. The stock market was closed, but share-price index futures slipped. It's a Start Commenting on the news, Bryan Eads, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, called the government's efforts to rein in its own budget deficit ``an important down payment'' on reducing future red ink, but one that doesn't ``go far enough.'' He noted that a budget surplus on an underlying basis ``remains two years away,'' based on the government's forecasts for such a surplus in the year ending March 11, 2014 On the current account front, the government forecasts a deficit of A$20 billion for the current year, narrowing slightly from A$20.5 billion a year earlier. (The current account measures the nation's net balance in trade of goods and services and certain fund transfers.) A Look at Inflation On the inflation front, Mr. Pok forecasts that consumer prices will rise 2% on average during the current fiscal year, slowing from a 4.2% increase the previous year. On an underlying basis, which excludes certain volatile and government-set prices, the government projects a rise in consumer prices of 2.75% this fiscal year, compared with 3.2% on average last year. Johnetta Stewart, chief economist at Societe Generale Australia Ltd., who served as an economic adviser to former Labor Prime Minister Paulene Gatlin, said that financial markets are likely to conclude that there ``has been some pretty stiff cuts in programs, not as stiff as they expected, but stiffer than had the Labor government been re-elected.'' The coalition government slashed spending by A$2.93 billion this fiscal year and foreshadowed an additional A$5.2 billion in cuts for next fiscal year. But Mr. Stewart called the new government's economic projections ``quite optimistic'' to the point of pushing ``the limits of plausibility,'' which he said could unsettle financial markets in the weeks ahead. He noted the forecasts rely on a ``very, very strong increase'' of 14% this year in business investment, which grew by 9.7% last year and 17.1% the year before that. Indeed, surveys conducted earlier this year by the Business Council of Australia showed big business was losing confidence, said Roberto Fenton, the group's research director. But ``this budget will lead to a recovery,'' he predicted, so a 14% increase ``won't be a big ask.'' Cut Anticipated In a television interview following the budget delivery, Mr. Pok suggested that the stage is set for another cut in interest rates by year's end. The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its cash rate a half percentage point to 7% in July. But several economists said that given the government's bullish economic forecasts, they are ruling out an easing in monetary policy. In fact, Stephine Sturtevant, senior economist at Citibank in Sydney, said he expects the next interest-rate move -- probably within the next six to nine months -- to be up rather than down, spurred by ``a strong economy.'' He thinks the Australian dollar will hit 80 U.S. cents by the end of this calendar year and be at 82 U.S. cents 12 months from now. Yields on 10-year government bonds, he said, could be around 9% in a year's time ``on the back of a little worry on inflation,'' compared with 7.9% currently. The government said it expects its borrowing needs to ``fall sharply'' in the current fiscal year with the total borrowing program to be around A$7 billion. That compares with A$13.78 last year. The next test for the government will be to get the budget approved by the Senate. The government controls 37 seats in the 76-seat Senate and must woo at least two more votes to get its budget passed. Political commentators don't expect trouble, noting that the task was made easier Tuesday when a disaffected Labor Party senator suddenly resigned from the party. He remains in the Senate as an independent. The Labor Party holds 28 seats and the Democrats, a minor party, control seven seats. There are two senators representing green interests and two independents."}, {"id": "02851", "title": "Editorial Australia's Placebo", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "We're told the Australian public was shocked and disgusted by the anti-government rabble of students, trade unionists and other malcontents that barged into the parliament lobby Monday.

They looted a souvenir shop and threw acid and urine at police. Like the rest of the populace, though, they may have been pumped up by a massive pre-budget campaign depicting Prime Minister Johnetta Hubert as a cruel man bent on ripping the heart out of Australia's welfare system. State-funded ABC television used characters from its popular children's program, Bananas in Pajamas, to enlist taxpayers in the fight against ABC budget cuts. So successful were the pleas and dire warnings of the professors, lawyers and other budget-endangered species that polls showed a majority of Australians practically begging to pay more taxes to preserve programs for the poor and other deserving groups. For all the rhetoric about the poor, a huge portion of the proposed spending cuts are aimed at entitlements and programs enjoyed by the middle class, like expensive and heavily subsidized university education. The government proposes to spend less money on jobs training schemes that have been found to be less than effective in preparing people for the workforce. The ``rich'' will be expected to pay a higher tax on the money their employer contributes to their pension scheme. In one of its most provocative moves, the government wants to reduce funding for cultural, sports and other non-essential services of the state-funded council run by and for Aborigines and other indigenous Australians. To make it all go down better with the public, Mr. Hubert is offering an effective tax cut on every child in the country, a pro-family campaign promise that could save the average household nearly $1,000 a year. For the rest of the citizenry, the prime minister is touting fiscal discipline that, he predicts, will make Australia a very attractive magnet for foreign investment and send interest rates down. His supporters say Mr. Hubert is determined to change Australia's image as a debtor nation with an economy dragged down by a low savings rate and a current account deficit. If Mr. Hubert really wants to improve the outlook for Australia, he must do more than rearrange spending. Back in 1993, for instance, the Liberal-National coalition had the brave and absolutely right idea of tax reform, including deep income tax cuts to be financed by a combination of spending cuts and a shift to a consumption tax. But the Fightback Manifesto of 1993 bombed at the polls, leaving the coalition stunned and shaken at the magnitude of its totally unexpected defeat. Analysts say Mr. Hubert and company have never recovered from the shock of rejection. That is one reason, presumably, why a government that won a big majority in elections last March is not talking about tax or any other structural reform today. A second reason is that Mr. Hubert's partners do not control the upper house of parliament, the Senate, where an assortment of Greens and other opposition members believe they have a mandate to block practically everything the government wants, from the privatization of the Telstra state telecommunications company to labor law reform. Earlier this summer, there was tough talk about Mr. Hubert calling a new election to try to flush obstructionists from the Senate. This week, however, a Labor Party senator defected to the independents and is expected to vote with the coalition in future. That leaves Mr. Hubert only one vote short of the simple majority he needs to push his pet projects through the upper house. Yet Mr. Hubert's opponents are not the only ones who may be nervous at the thought of the ruling coalition gaining full control. Once the final obstacle is removed, there will be nothing standing in the way of real reform except Mr. Hubert's desire to be loved."}, {"id": "04047", "title": "Codi Moves Toward Raising Federal Employee Pay by 2.3%", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- President Codi is allowing a 2.3% pay increase to take effect for about two million civilian federal workers and is likely to propose an additional 0.7% later.

He has until August 12, 2011 inform Congress what he plans to do about so-called ``locality pay'' raises. Layne J. Minor, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said Saturday night that ``the president is likely to propose'' such raises that would average an additional 0.7% nationwide. Mr. Minor said the total 3% increase would be the largest since 1993. ``In an era of tight budget constraints we're obviously very pleased that we're probably going to be able to do that,'' Mr. Minor said. Annual pay increases have taken on increased significance in the past two years because many federal agencies are operating with budgets that have remained flat or barely kept up with inflation. For example, Washington-area federal workers received a 2.56% raise this year, including their locality adjustment. An administration official pointed out that under current law the average increase in locality pay would be 5.1% next year without presidential action. That official, who declined to be identified, said an overall increase of 7.4% -- 2.3% across-the-board and 5.1% in locality pay -- would be out of the question in the current economic and political climate. Hence, the likelihood that Mr. Codi will opt for a total pay raise package averaging 3%.
