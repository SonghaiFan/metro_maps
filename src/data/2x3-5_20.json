            "full_text": "Two of the nation's largest wireless-paging concerns, facing an onslaught of challengers in an array of new wireless services, shook up senior managements, and one of them hired a seasoned Bell executive to improve its fortunes. MobileMedia Corp., the nation's second-largest paging company, said three of its top executives, Chief Executive Gretchen M. Junie, Johnetta M. Gorham, president and chief operating officer, and Rodrigo O. Rocha, senior vice president of operations, agreed to leave the company. And SBC Communications Inc.'s strategic-planning chief, Johnetta T. Burnham, quit to join Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Inc., also known as Carper, as president and chief executive officer. A spokeswoman at MobileMedia declined to elaborate on the mass resignation but said the board and the executives mutually agreed that a management change was necessary. The company named board member Davina A. Vitale to fill the position of chairman, vacant since late 2009, and serve as acting chief executive, succeeding Mr. Junie. ``There was an agreement between the board and the executives that a different approach to management was necessary given the company's dramatic growth due to acquisition and internal growth,'' MobileMedia's spokeswoman said. ``We are now a much larger company in size and scope... . Different skill sets are needed.'' The executives couldn't be reached to comment. Both paging companies could come under increasing attack in the next couple of years from cellular-phone companies and newer personal-communication services. Each phone service aims to offer paging functions with their cellular phones so a paging customer wouldn't have to carry a separate wireless pager. To respond, paging services have tried to erect their own two-way messaging services, but these have so far failed. MobileMedia, which has deferred a private placement of debt securities because of the management change, said it is searching for a chief executive and chief operating officer. H. Stephine Bourne, vice president of corporate development, was named acting vice president of operations. Mr. Junie will continue as a director and serve as a consultant during the transition. The departures of Messrs. Gorham and Ploder are effective May 28, 2011 company said. At Mtel, Mr. Burnham, 46 years old, will assume the twin posts at the Jackson, Miss., company on April 13, 2011 succeeds M. Bernie Knowles, 51, who resigned earlier this year. Johnetta M. Parthenia, 62, who has been acting CEO since then, will continue as chairman. The resignation of Mr. Burnham marks the first defection of a major SBC executive since the Baby Bell agreed to acquire Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco. Mr. Burnham, an career SBC official, recently was named head of strategic planning and technology for the San Antonio-based regional-phone company. He headed Bell's wireless arm, which he successfully turned into one of the most enviable among the Bells. Mr. Burnham's future with the combined SBC-PacTel had been unclear. He wasn't involved in developing that landmark agreement. Moreover, his position in the combined company hadn't been worked out, putting him on equal footing with virtually every other top SBC and PacTel executive. Mr. Burnham, in an interview Monday, called his new job ``a wonderful opportunity'' and said he was looking forward to making paging technology more accessible to consumers. His biggest challenge at Mtel will be the Skytel unit, whose two-way paging service has been plagued by dropped messages, garbled data and memory blackouts. Amid a broad market sell-off, MobileMedia shares fell 87.5 cents, or 8%, to close at $10.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Mtel closed at $11.375, down 81.25 cents, or 7%, on Nasdaq. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, SBC fell 87.5 cents to close at $48.375. --Rosenberry Kennard contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "In the largest effort yet to target different home-computer users, Compaq Computer Corp. rolled out five new consumer lines. The computers, many of which will be in stores before school starts this fall, range in price from $1,699 to $3,999, and in size from laptops to full-sized multimedia machines. ``Everything has been one-size-fits-all,'' says Ricki Mccool of market researcher International Data Corp. ``Compaq is segmenting the market.'' But in doing so, the huge Houston computer maker also is gambling that consumers aren't just looking for the lowest prices, but will pony up for fancy speakers, videophone capability and other bells and whistles. Many of the new machines are pricey for an industry that seems to be increasingly offering less expensive, scaled-down products. `Doodads Are Catchy' ``The doodads are catchy,'' says Barton Leininger, analyst at Smith Barney, but ``is there a BMW-Mercedes end of the market?'' He says he believes Compaq is hoping the new lines will help it rebuild its profit margins in an intensely price-competitive business. Consumer sales provided about 16% of Compaq's sales last year, but just about 5% of its profit. Michaele D. Grundy, Compaq senior vice president, says the company expects its heaviest sales to be at the low end of the range, computers with a retail price of less than $2,000. But he says the company's research found that many consumers who are purchasing their second and third computer want more options. Analysts say one solid seller is likely to be the Presario 8000 line, which Compaq bills as an ``ultimate multimedia machine.'' The sports car of computers offers premium speakers and sound, three-dimensional graphics and carries a price tag of $2,499 to $3,299. Sega Entertainment Inc. also said it will develop arcade-quality games for the machines by early next year. ``A lot of 35-year-old men are willing to spend'' for such features, Mr. Mccool says. Meeting a Demand? Less clear is the demand for Compaq's new Presario 3000 series, a flat-screen, ``minitower'' computer that should be easier to move from home to summer house or from room to room. Compaq says the sleek machine uses 40% less space than a regular PC and cuts cables with a cordless mouse, stored in a ``mouse house.'' But the machine weighs in at about 26 pounds and will start at $3,499, leading some analysts to wonder whether consumers wouldn't rather buy a couple of cheap PCs for different locations. In addition, the company introduced a notebook computer for the home, with speakers, Disc and built-in telephone-answering machine, and prices ranging from $2,499 to $3,999. Compaq, which trails the low-price Packard Bell Electronics Inc. in the consumer market, also upgraded its standard home PC, now called Presario 4000, and its home-office model, called the Presario 6000, with a range of fast processors and large disk drives packaged in newly designed taupe-gray boxes. ``We believe this is the most complete product line ever launched for home PCs,'' Compaq's Mr. Grundy said. All the new models also feature buttons intended to make computers more like other home electronics. One, for instance, will turn on the compact-disc player, another will retrieve phone messages and a third will put the computer to ``sleep'' to save energy. All the machines are ready for videophones, although the $200 cameras needed to make them work won't be available until the fourth quarter."

            "full_text": "Sega of America Inc., hurting from a vicious price war with Sony Corp., replaced its founding chairmen and announced the resignation of its once highflying chief executive Tommie Codi. The maker of video-game players also snatched one of Sony's key executives as its new head of product development. Edmunds, a unit of Sega Enterprises Ltd. in Tokyo, said Melchor Wille, a director and executive vice president of the parent company since 1993, is the new chairman and chief executive officer of Sega of America. As chairman, Mr. Shelley succeeds Edmunds of America founder Davina Kurtz, who retains seats on the boards of both the parent company and the unit's holding company, Sega Holdings USA Inc.. Mr. Shelley also succeeds founding co-chairman of Edmunds of America Etheridge Madison, who remains president and CEO of the parent company, and chairman of the Sega Holdings USA. Hailed as a Wunderkind As CEO, Mr. Shelley will succeed Mr. Codi, who was hailed as a wunderkind for helping to turn little-known Sega into the industry leader in recent years. Edmunds lost that seat this summer when Sony shipped its popular new PlayStation game player. Mr. Codi, 52 years old, is leaving Sega on June 12, 2011 join Education Technologies LLC, an education-software concern founded this year by former junk-bond purveyor Michaela Henry and Oracle Corp.. Chairman and Chief Executive Lasandra Juarez. Mr. Codi, who will remain on the board of Sega of America in Redwood City, Calif., said he agreed to join Education Technologies in March, and gave Edmunds his resignation in May. He said he wanted to leave Sega earlier but, ``They won't let me.'' He said he is not leaving Edmunds to avoid the heat of putting the company back on top. ``I love hot seats,'' he said. Instead, Mr. Codi said he is leaving so he can have a sizable equity stake in a start-up business that seeks to make money by addressing the country's education problems. He wouldn't disclose his stake in Education Technologies. Remarkable Departure Mr. Codi's departure is remarkable because just three years ago, he was hailed as a great example of how Japanese companies have learned to use American executives to market to American customers. His departure marks the second time in six months that a Japanese company has replaced its high-profile American management with trusted executives from the home office. Last December, Sony ousted Michaele Polley for his role in getting Sony to finance Mandalay Entertainment, which didn't perform as well as Sony had hoped. In a statement, Mr. Wille said ``We are sorry to see Tom leave Dacosta, but he has left us in a strong position in the marketplace.'' But in fact, analysts said Dacosta is taking a drubbing by Sony in the video-game cartridge market, which is expected to have $4 billion to $5 billion in sales this year. Sega's Saturn player, introduced last May, was selling well until last October, when Sony introduced its competing PlayStation. Last month, Sony lowered prices on its player to $199, forcing Dacosta to meet the price, although Edmunds had planned to sell its units for $249. That spurred sales of both companies' products, but Dacosta has run out, while Sony still has some available. ``In the video-game arena, Sony came from nowhere, and now they dominate next-generation players,'' said Jefferies & Co. analyst Leeanna Belisle. Bernie Travers, who is one of the executives to help launch Sony's PlayStation, has joined Dacosta as executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party business. It was unclear late Monday if Mr. Travers is succeeding another executive."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Amid disappointing results for its second quarter, Cellstar Corp. said Tesha Pasquale, the company's president and chief operating officer, resigned for ``health reasons.'' The company declined to elaborate on Mr. Pasquale's health condition, and he couldn't be reached to comment. Mr. Pasquale, 50 years old, came to Cellstar in February 2010 from GTE Corp., where he was senior vice president. His resignation comes three months after the company's chief financial officer, Geraldine J. Hinton, 40, resigned after two weeks on the job. At the same time, Richelle A. Harrison, an outside director, resigned from Cellstar's board. Albert Angelo, 52, the company's chief executive officer, will assume Mr. Pasquale's duties relating to sales and international development. Richelle Cohen, 51, executive vice president, administration, and chief financial officer, will assume responsibilities for operations and financial matters. After the market close, the cellular-phone wholesaler and retailer reported a net loss for the second quarter of $3 million, compared with net income of $5.2 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. The company attributed the loss to unprofitable growth of its centers inside Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Samantha's Club stores and unusual operating and foreign-currency losses associated with international operations. Cellstar said revenue in the second quarter rose 29% to $225.6 million from $157.2 million a year earlier. The company said it hired consultants to find long-range solutions to its systems problems and expects to see results starting in its fourth quarter. On the Nasdaq Stock Market Monday, the stock closed at $7.625, down 12.5 cents."

            "full_text": "When Intel Corp. unveiled its powerful new 200-megahertz  chip in June, Barton Gentry of Voorhees, N.J., couldn't wait to get a computer that had it. Within days, the stockbroker had placed an order for a $2,800 personal computer from mail-order giant Gateway 2015 Inc. ``I need speed. I hate to wait'' while the computer processes data, says Mr. Gentry, who runs complex graphical programs that require a lot of computing muscle. Thanks to sophisticated repeat computer buyers like Mr. Gentry, sales at Gateway 2015 and other mail-order computer marketers are booming. While the overall personal computer market grew 16% in the first quarter from a year earlier, Gateway's sales climbed 47%, to $1.16 billion. Direct seller Dell Computer Corp.'s revenue surged 44%, to $1.6 billion, and CDW Computer Centers Inc. reported a 46% gain in first-quarter sales. Overall, 20% of PCs were sold through mail order last year, up from 18.7% of a smaller market in 2009, according to International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., research firm. Much of the business comes from repeat consumer and business buyers, who, once they become comfortable with technology, want all the latest bells and whistles at a good price. ``When you know what you want, you might as well get the best price on it,'' says Jimmy Benedict of Aurora, Colo., who has bought two computers from mail-order companies in the past two years. In contrast, first-time buyers tend to want to try out the keyboard and move around the mouse before they buy, and they often need a lot of hand-holding. ``First-time buyers are the most expensive sales, because you have the least amount of gross profit dollars, and you spend the most time working with the buyer,'' says Jami Eversole, president of computer superstore chain CompUSA Inc., which caters to sophisticated buyers. Repeat buyers are more willing to pay the price of a fancier system, which usually carries a higher profit margin. According to IntelliQuest, an Austin, Texas, market research firm, 78% of experienced buyers spend more than $1,800 for a computer system, while only 62% of first-time buyers do. Gateway, which sells 75% of its computers to repeat buyers, says that its average customer spends $2,850 on a computer system. Direct manufacturers like Gateway, which sells largely to consumers, home offices and small businesses, and Dell, which sells almost all of its computers to businesses, claim they have another edge: Because they don't have to move computers out to retailers, they say they can get new technology into customers' hands more quickly than other computer makers can. In addition, because there isn't a retail middleman, prices are lower than those for computers sold in retail stores, says Moses Somers, Della's vice chairman. For instance, Gateway is selling a computer for $2,498 that includes a 133-megahertz  microprocessor, an eight-speed Disc, a 17-inch monitor and a color printer. Buying a similar system from Hewlett-Packard Co. with a slower Disc would cost about $2,900, or 16% more. Those differences were magnified this year when prices for key components such as memory chips and microprocessors plunged. Because a Gateway or a Dell carries only about 20 days of parts inventory, they could use the cheaper parts faster, allowing them to cut prices without hurting profit margins. Still, even experienced computer buyers are often hesitant about buying a $2,000 to $3,000 computer sight unseen. Instead, they typically start out by ordering smaller items, such as software and hardware upgrades, by mail order and then move up to computers. And mail order isn't problem-free. Returns and repairs can be time consuming, and buyers who haven't done their homework may be disappointed with what they get. Shipping charges are tacked on, and a few states require buyers to pay sales taxes. In addition, notes Christa Leggett of Hewlett-Packard, new technology is more likely to have glitches. Nonetheless, analysts expect the mail-order market to continue to grow as the number of repeat buyers expands. Last year, repeat computer buyers bought 57% of new computers, and the number is expected to increase, says Computer Intelligence Infocorp, a La Jolla, Calif., market-research firm. But direct marketers will have to work to capture those customers. A survey by IntelliQuest found that 90% of business computer users are willing to buy mail order, but far fewer actually do. To reach ``the next 20%'' of computer users who haven't tried mail order, Gateway Chief Executive Theron Covert launched a national television advertising campaign last fall and has begun selling machines through the Internet. Meanwhile, Micro Warehouse Inc. mails its catalogs only to those who already own a computer. ``The experienced customers are also the most prolific customers,'' says Petrina Crum, Micro Warehouse's president and chief executive. Georgeanna Durkin, a Louisville, Ky., physician and computer buff, says he welcomes the dozen or so computer catalogs he gets each week. He buys his PCs from Dell and virtually everything else from other mail-order concerns. ``It's so much more convenient,'' he says. ``It's a nuisance for me to get in a car and go somewhere.'' Customers who have never bought mail order are a different matter, though, as Insight Enterprises of Tempe, Ariz., found recently. The small but fast-growing company sends out 15 million catalogs a year, mostly to experienced business users. But Danae Mclemore, Insight's senior vice president of marketing, decided to send 20,000 catalogs to parents in affluent neighborhoods whose children were graduating from high school, figuring it was a ``no-brainer'' that they would welcome the chance to buy a portable computer for their college-bound children. Mr. Mclemore figured wrong. Insight didn't sell a single computer from the mailing."

            "full_text": "Cristobal Battle, an 11-year veteran of the Charlotte-based brokerage house, defected to Everen Securities Inc. of Chicago, a larger regional firm that is expanding its roster of stock researchers. At Interstate/Johnson Lane, Mr. Santana directed the firm's dozen analysts until earlier this year, when he stepped out of management to focus solely on following health-care stocks -- a move management hoped would attract more investment-banking business in that industry. (Most companies want an underwriter that has a highly regarded analyst on board who will follow the company's stock.) Now the efforts will be slowed. ``We'll just have to recover,'' says Thomasina Avril, director of investment banking at Interstate/Johnson Lane. The timing of the departure is awkward for the firm. Interstate/Johnson Lane has lagged far behind Southeastern rivals such as Robinson-Humphrey Co. and Morgan Keegan & Co. in the number of deals brought to market, but it has been trying to catch up in recent months. The firm has been the lead underwriter on just two stock offerings so far this year, according to Securities Data Co., Newark, N.J.: EquiMed Inc. (which Mr. Santana followed) and Eagle Bancshares Inc.. The firm's current research director, Johnetta Harrison Jr., has begun looking for a replacement and a second health-care analyst. In addition, the firm is likely to fill an additional vacancy created by the May departure of Thaddeus Devries, a special-situations analyst. Still, ``shaking loose (top analysts) will be a challenge,'' says Mr. Avril. Mr. Santana, for now the lone health-care analyst at Everen, which hopes to build a team in that industry, has nothing ill to say of his former employer. ``When an analyst leaves, it can be for lots of reasons,'' he says. ``The opportunity presented by Everen was just compelling to me.'' -- Rickie Bruno"

            "full_text": "Johnetta W. Swanner, Dial Corp.'s longtime chairman and chief executive officer, announced unexpectedly that he will retire on September 12, 2010 announcement caught analysts by surprise and prompted speculation that the retirement may hasten a disassembly of the Phoenix-based consumer products and diversified services company. Mr. Swanner, who is 62 years old, has no obvious heir apparent. Even as he announced his departure, Mr. Swanner underscored Dial's intention to pursue a planned division of the company into a spun-off Dial for consumer products and a renamed Viad Corp., which will operate the company's many service businesses. Mr. Teets Tuesday said in a statement that Dial's board unanimously rejected a call by the company's largest shareholder to delay the planned separation. Michaele F. Bennie and his Wiggins Ernst, N.J.-based Heine Securities Corp., holder of a 9.9% stake, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing a week ago that Dial's divorce plan is seriously flawed. Mr. Bennie's filing brought into the open discontent among some Dial shareholders who believe that the separation plans engineered by Mr. Swanner fall short of maximizing shareholder returns. Mr. Swanner couldn't be reached for comment. A spokesman said the decision to retire was unrelated to Mr. Bennie's representations to the board. ``Baughman Swanner has been thinking about this retirement for some time,'' the spokesman said, adding that with Dial's division nearing completion, Mr. Swanner just felt it was time. Mr. Price couldn't be reached. There has been extensive speculation that Mr. Bennie and other major shareholders have informally asked Mr. Swanner to step aside, believing that his plan wouldn't get maximum returns for shareholders. In the SEC filing, Mr. Bennie complained of a lack of confidence in the board and that, under Mr. Swanner, Dial's corporate spending was too high. Mr. Swanner, however, has in the past rejected these suggestions. Tuesday, Mr. Swanner said in the statement that he will continue as chairman and chief executive of Dial until the Dial consumer products unit is spun off and will be chairman and chief executive of Viad until his retirement. Thereafter, he will remain a director of Viad. Dial said Mr. Swanner told the board that he will ``put in place a succession plan, which will include the appointment of a president and chief operating officer of Viad.'' Dial's division, which needs Internal Revenue Service approval, is expected in early Fall. ``With Johnetta Swanner gone there is going to be less of an emotional tie to keep the businesses together,'' said Hong Hodges, analyst at Smith Barney Inc.. Other analysts said a strong new head of Viad could attract potential buyers. Mr. Swanner ruled the one-time bus company known as Greyhound Lines Inc. with an iron fist, buying and selling operations with almost dizzying speed. A weightlifter and sometimes outspoken born-again Christian, Mr. Swanner raised eyebrows with personal investments that paralleled Dial's. Mr. Bennie complained in his SEC filing that Dial's board failed to react to what Mr. Bennie called a ``material conflict in (sic) interest.'' Mr. Swanner held and recently sold interests in the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team and the Phoenix Suns basketball team, in which the company also had investments. Dial has said that Mr. Swanner recently sold his interests in both teams without a profit. Dial stock, which closed Tuesday at $26 a share, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, has drifted from a high of $32 a share in February, shortly before the company announced its widely anticipated spin-off plans for the consumer business."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- E. Michelina Darling, one of three vice chairmen on the Chase Manhattan Corp. board, resigned unexpectedly. A highly regarded executive credited with helping Chauncey recover from foreign loan troubles in the late 1980s, Mr. Darling is the highest-ranking executive of the old Chase Manhattan to leave in the wake of the company's merger earlier this year with the former Chemical Banking Corp.. The news caught analysts by surprise and led to speculation about possible further departures among the senior executive ranks of what is now the nation's largest bank-holding company. ``Geez, almighty,'' said Thomasina Jack, an analyst with UBS, when informed of the resignation. Mr. Jack said he thought Mr. Darling might leave eventually, but he said he was very surprised that the departure happened so soon. ``This is not a merger, this is an acquisition,'' Mr. Jack said. ``Just look at who came out on top. It's Chemical people in almost all the key roles now.'' Indeed, of the company's four remaining top executives, only one -- President and Chief Operating Officer Thomasina G. Kimberely -- worked at the old Chase. Mr. Kimberely, who was chairman of the old Chester, didn't return a phone call Tuesday. Officials of the new Chase stressed that Mr. Darling's departure was voluntary and said it didn't presage any high-level shakeup. ``You'll see no further announcements,'' said Johnetta Peckham, the bank's chief spokesman. ``This happens in mergers. A guy doesn't get the job he had been doing, and he leaves.'' That's exactly what the German-born Mr. Darling, who is 52 years old, said had happened. A 25-year veteran of Chauncey who started his career there as a credit trainee in the company's Frankfurt office, Mr. Darling rose to become a vice chairman, responsible for global financial services. Since the merger, however, Mr. Darling's responsibilities were reduced. Management of the global bank was handed to Williemae B. Harvey Jr., another vice chairman and former Chemical executive, and Mr. Friend focused more on finance, information and transaction services, and market and credit risk. ``My wife said it's a midlife crisis,'' Mr. Darling said in an interview Tuesday. ``I've assumed responsibilities after the merger that were different from the ones I had before, and frankly they're not as much fun as what I used to do.'' Mr. Darling said he informed Mr. Kimberely and Chase Chairman Wan V. Jorgensen of his decision within the past few weeks. ``They were disappointed,'' he said, though he declined to comment on whether the two men had asked him to reconsider the resignation, which he said was effective Tuesday. Mr. Darling said he is considering the possibility of teaching at a university. A friend and close colleague of Mr. Kimberely's when the two worked at the old Chase, Mr. Darling acknowledged that he never developed as close a relationship with Mr. Jorgensen, his new boss, though he described their relations as ``cordial.'' ``I think it takes a lot longer than the time I've known him to build a relationship,'' Mr. Darling said."

            "full_text": "Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., said it will open a switching and commercial data center to allow Internet service-provider companies faster access to the global computer network. Digital said it has agreements with four service providers to house servers and switching equipment in the center, in Palo Alto, Calif., which it says is the first that isn't affiliated with a larger telecommunications company. Such centers will grow as service providers seek to offer consumers faster communications without becoming dependent on equipment of telephone companies and other rivals, said Roberto M. Silvers, a Digital vice president for research. Separately, the computer and software company said it has delayed the introduction of a search program for personal computers by a month. Preliminary versions of the product, a version of its popular AltaVista search software, will be available next week, rather than in June as originally planned. Cheyenne Expects Earnings to Beat Estimates Cheyenne Software Inc. said it expects to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 21 cents to 24 cents a share, exceeding analysts' estimates. News of the better-than-expected results sent the Roslyn Heights, N.Y., software maker's shares up $2.875, or 19%, to $18.125 in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. A First Call analysts' consensus projects profit of 20 cents a share for the quarter ended March 12, 2011 the 2010 quarter, Cheyenne had net income of $9 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $41 million. The results for the quarter include a charge of two cents a share for expenses related to McAfee Associates Inc.'s aborted attempt to take over Cheyenne. The results don't include a one-time charge of four cents a share tied to a Hewlett-Packard Co. pact. Natural MicroSystems Expects Loss on Charge Natural MicroSystems Inc. expects to take a one-time acquisition-related charge of $4.5 million, or 80 cents a share, and report a loss for the second quarter of between 53 cents and 55 cents a share, President and Chief Executive Officer Roberto Sluder said. Mr. Sluder said the charge reflects the write-off of research and development costs of products at TEKnique Inc., a company it acquired last month. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned 12 cents a share. Revenues are expected to have climbed to ``a touch over'' $12 million, beating analysts' expectations by about $1 million and up more than 65% from a year ago. Natural MicroSystems, Natick, Mass., makes circuit boards and software that let computers handle telephone services. Group to Manage J.P. Morgan's Tech Operations A group led by Computer Sciences Corp. signed a $2 billion, seven-year contract with J.P. Morgan & Co., New York, to manage about a third of the banking company's global technology operations. The Computer Sciences group includes Andersen Consulting, Chicago, and units of VastComm Network Corp., New York, and Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia. SGS-Thomson's Profit Jumped 44% SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, a semiconductor maker, posted a 44% jump in second-quarter profit to $176.1 million from a year earlier, exceeding expectations. Operating profit soared 42% to $224.3 million. Sales grew 19% to $1.05 billion. SGS-Thomson is the Dutch unit of Thomson-CSF SA, which is a subsidiary of Thomson SA, France's state-owned electronics group. SGS-Thomson shares rose 6.2% to 164.1 francs ($32.62) in Paris. Computer Maker Lost $8.4 Million Telxon Corp., Akron, Ohio, said it had a loss of $4.8 million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue of $112.4 million for the fiscal first quarter ended March 12, 2011 with $2.2 million, or 14 cents, on revenue of $103.5 million in the year-earlier period. Delays in getting products to market and high operating costs hurt revenue, the company said. The maker of hand-held portable computer systems said it expects a loss of about 50 cents a share for the fiscal first half ending June 12, 2011 a projected revenue increase of 5%. It said it expects to be profitable for the fiscal year ending December 11, 2011 based on profitability in the second half and an 8% to 10% increase in revenue. Separately, Fransisca E. Markle, 47 years old, was named a director, succeeding Williemae J. Bambi, 62, whom Mr. Markle succeeded as president and chief operating officer March 01, 2011 size of the board remains six directors. Dun & Bradstreet Declares Quarterly Dividend Dun & Bradstreet Corp., Wilton, Conn., which plans to split into three publicly traded companies in October, declared a third-quarter dividend of 25 cents a share. The payout, which D&B said will be divided between two of the new companies, is lower than estimates the company made in January when it announced the breakup. After the breakup, the new Dun & Bradstreet Corp., a financial-information services company, will pay a quarterly dividend of 22 cents a share. Cognizant Corp., an information-services company formed in the breakup, will pay three cents a share. The third company, A.C. Nielsen, won't pay a dividend, D&B said. CDW Computer Said Net Rose on Higher Sales CDW Computer Centers Inc., Buffalo Grove, Ill., said second-quarter net income surged 97% to $8.5 million, or 39 cents a share, from $4.3 million, or 21 cents a share, the year earlier. The direct marketer of computer products said sales rose 50% to $218.7 million from $146.2 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, shares of CDW Computer closed at $41, up $3.25, or 8.6%. The results topped analysts'' estimates of 30 cents a share. The company said its third-quarter sales outlook is ``favorable as customer demand has remained strong'' through the first half of July. In the most recent quarter, CDW said its gross profit margin grew to 13.5% of sales, from 12.7% a year ago, and administrative expenses fell to 7.6% of sales, from 8%. Electronics Segment Boosted Muldoon Hammonds's Net Buoyed by record sales and an especially strong performance by its electronics segment, Northrop Grumman Corp. reported a nearly 8% jump in second-quarter earnings to $86 million, or $1.69 a share, from $79 million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier. The results were well above the consensus estimate of analysts of around $1.20 a share. The Los Angeles company said that operating profit in its electronics segment doubled, paving the way for operating profit of $221 million for the quarter, up 25% from a year earlier. The latest results included the defense and electronics systems business of Westinghouse Electric, which Northrop Grumman acquired for $3 billion earlier this year. The electronics systems segment accounted for about 51% of the record $2.14 billion sales in the quarter. That compares with sales of $1.76 billion a year earlier. Amphenol's Earning Rose 8.4% Amphenol Corp., a connector, cable and interconnect-systems manufacturer, reported that second-quarter earnings rose 8.4% partly because of an increase in connector sales. Amphenol said earnings increased to $17.4 million, or 37 cents a share, from $16.1 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Because of currency translations, Amphenol said, sales dropped 4.2% to $198.9 million from $207.6 million. Earnings were in line with a First Call survey of analysts' estimates. Amphenol, Wallingford, Conn., said it anticipates increased activity in the international markets for its cable TV and broadband communications products. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Amphenol shares rose $1.375, or 7.2%, to close at $20.375. Inacom's Earnings Rose 72% Inacom Corp., Omaha, Neb., said second-quarter net income rose 72% to $4.4 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with net of $2.6 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 46% to $769.9 million. The results beat analysts' estimates of 34 cents a share. The computer-services firm said revenue from its computer-products unit rose 46% to $718.6 million and revenue from communications products rose 71% to $21.1 million. Service revenue increased 36% to $30.2 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, Inacom shares rose 19% to $20.50, up $3.313. Nu-kote's Earnings Will Fall Short Nu-kote Holding Inc. expects that earnings for its first quarter ended March 12, 2011 down from a year earlier and that revenue fell short of internal estimates. A year ago, Nu-kote reported net income of $4.9 million, or 44 cents a share, on sales of $104.1 million. The company plans to report results during the week of April 17, 2011 First Call survey of four analysts projects earnings of 26 cents a share. Nu-kote, a Dallas maker of printer and copier products, said the consolidation of the hard-copy unit it acquired in 2010 from Switzerland's Pelikan Holding AG, has resulted in a greater-than-expected decline in sales of impact-printing products.

He plans to retire April 13, 2011 vice chairman of middle market, banking and community development at Chase, which merged earlier this year with Chemical Banking. Mr. Campbell will be the third executive named to the second-in-command position at the company in four years. Mr. Davina said the predecessors ``did not fit with the culture of our management team'' which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1985 ``pretty hard-nosed.'' Franklin closed down $1.50, or 10%, to $13 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On Tuesday, the shares fell 16% on a disappointing quarterly earnings report. Mr. Davina said that the company hopes to overcome disappointing domestic retail sales in recent quarters by expanding abroad, where its electronic books and translators are ``extremely potent.'' He said Mr. Campbell, who held a number of senior international and regional positions at Chemical Banking, will contribute to both expansion abroad and to ``the stimulation of more rapid growth here at home.''"

            "full_text": "Compaq Computer Corp., hoping to extend its leadership in selling computers to companies, is expected to roll out a new set of desktop personal computers Monday, starting at $1,100. The Houston computer maker will introduce three lines, including low-priced machines, a middle-range series of computers that are easier to fix and monitor, and a top-end line. The new machines, to be called the Deskpro 2015, 4000 and 6000 series, replace Compaq's ProLinea, Robichaud and Deskpro XL lines. ``This is a very, very interesting and aggressive move on Compaq's part,'' says Martine Ellis, vice president at Dataquest, a market researcher in San Jose, Calif., who notes that the company will be offering computers at lower prices than ever before and has structured its offerings to be more in tune with the marketplace. Mr. Ellis said the new lines may help Compaq gain ground against tough competitors such as Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Gateway 2015. While Compaq hasn't lost market share, those competitors have kept Compaq from gaining. Meanwhile, he says, ``this will force Dell and Gateway to work harder.'' The new lines grew out of a year-long Compaq effort to re-examine its method of designing and assembling PCs in an effort to cut prices while retaining profit. ``This is the first time we ever asked teams to not just examine product lines, but every bit of logistics,'' says Lezlie Rosenberger, senior business manager for Compaq's desktop line. The study led to a design that could be efficiently implemented by small work teams, and which reduced the number of screws per computer to 15 from 32; only nine screws now are actually touched during assembly. The overhaul has allowed Compaq to cut costs and lower prices while still shooting for companywide profit margins of 23% to 24%, Mr. Rosenberger said. With prices ranging from $1,100 to $3,350, the Deskpro 2015 line starts at a few hundred dollars lower than Compaq's old ProLinea line, which Mr. Ellis calls ``overdesigned.'' The entry-level machines start with a 100 megahertz  processor and lack a Disc drive. The cheapest machine with a top-of-the-line  Pro processor starts at $2,500. The 4000 series, ranging in price from $1,600 to $3,575, is designed for large networks and includes security features that will alert system administrators if someone tries to tamper with the PC. It also has latches for opening the machines to make them easier to fix or upgrade. The 6000 series, costing $2,800 to $4,800, includes a range of fast processors, huge memories and hard drives and is expected to be used for heavy number crunching, like trading in financial markets, software development and computer-aided design."

            "full_text": "``Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.'' It's a myth. Inventing a unique product or revolutionary technology does not guarantee success. Markets must be primed, opinion makers educated, customers persuaded. Back at the office, product managers must reassure executives that the product will eventually take off--even as we struggle with our own fears that it won't. In 1982, Texas Instruments developed an advanced new technology called digital signal processing. Today our processors run everything from cellular telephones and disk drives to Patriot missiles and automobile suspension systems. But we owe our success to seven years of beating our own paths to the world, not the other way around. Digital signal processors are superfast computer chips; the most modern and expensive DSPs are up to 10 times faster than today's most powerful microprocessor. When TI developed DSPs in the early 1980s, our engineers recognized their potential for consumer products involving speech compression and multimedia, as well as various military applications. The next step was to sell that vision to the engineers who design such products. We realized that we couldn't generate widespread demand for our technology until people in the field understood it. We began working with university professors, demonstrating potential applications and providing tools to help graduate and undergraduate engineering students understand the complex mathematics behind digital signal processing. In their dual roles as teachers and consultants, our university colleagues were instrumental in introducing our technology, both to the next generation of design engineers and to product designers at customer sites around the country. And we made clear that we were committed to the success of those who used our technology, by working shoulder to shoulder with engineers on job sites, investing in development tools for them to use and setting up a round-the-clock technical support hot line. These efforts consumed more than five years. During that phase, we understood that our prime management challenge was not so much to get the technology out into the marketplace as to sustain the commitment of everyone involved. We knew, too, that not every promising product or technology grows into a moneymaker. During a lengthy gestation period, it's easy to lose faith in what you're trying to accomplish. But we didn't give in to our uncertainties. Instead, these are some of the strategies that worked for us: Create a buzz. Many of our early customers were entrepreneurs or company mavericks, whose futures depended heavily on the success of our technology. They needed frequent reassurances that it was viable and that we were committed to it for the long term. Promises from us often weren't enough, so we sought third-party support in developing new DSP-based applications to help sustain our customers' enthusiasm. We also pursued an aggressive public relations program, announcing product applications under development and submitting case histories and how-to articles for publication. We earned more press coverage than money in the beginning, but the interest we sparked was essential in attracting potential customers and keeping current ones on board. Recruit internal advocates. It's a tough balancing act for a manager to tell customers that success is just around the corner, while urging his own executives to be patient a while longer. A good strategy for us was to invite senior executives to a customer site. They were able to sense the enthusiasm in the marketplace and to see firsthand the labor involved in nurturing a new technology. It's also wise to identify key executives who will champion your project with the rest of upper management and the board of directors. Our advocates at Texas Instruments understood the technology and endorsed our marketing strategies. Best of all, they were able to keep the executive team informed and satisfied, so that our product team could go about its business. Establish benchmarks. To assure ourselves we were on the right track, we set up checkpoints to chart our progress. We tracked how many companies had agreed to use our DSPs, a measure of the promise that real-world applications employing our technology were forthcoming. We also monitored how many development systems we were shipping to current and potential customers, giving us a sense of sowing new seeds in the marketplace. And we kept hoping for competition. You know you're onto something when your rivals start angling for a piece of the action. Naturally, that means it's also crucial to maintain your market share, which we did. Texas Instruments now controls an estimated 44% of the market for DSPs. Don't limit yourself. When you've got an emerging product, no customer is too small, no idea too zany. We followed up on virtually every inquiry, visiting design engineers in fledgling companies and even calling on entrepreneurs working in garages--because they were willing to take a chance. Larger companies often are more risk-averse. We learned quickly not to limit our customers with our own ideas. They thought of applications we'd never imagined. We hadn't considered how DSPs could be used in disk drives, for instance. And we hadn't thought about their application in automobile suspension systems until we got word in the mid-1980s that scientists at Lotus had installed them in champion racing cars. By keeping close tabs on our customers, we learned from them and adapted their ideas to our marketing strategy. The market for DSPs is expected to exceed $12 billion by 2000--a level of success we never dreamed of back in 1982. Before long, consumers may wonder how we ever got along without DSPs, and they'll assume that such a valuable technology was an overnight success for its inventor. We'll know better. Mr. Holton is president of the Texas Instruments Semiconductor Group."

            "full_text": "Get ready for more sweeping change buffeting Chicago advertising giant Leoma Richelle. First, its prize account, Pierre Mose, continues to take heat from President Codi's mounting pressures to restrict cigarette ads. And the agency made one of the industry's most embarrassing foul-ups of the year, miscalculating ad spending for McDonald's by a whopping $20 million. Now, it's going through a management shakeup that includes the departure of its chief U.S. creative officer. Richelle unveiled the latest changes Friday, naming Michaele B. Corey, 52 years old, to the newly created post of vice chairman and co-chief creative officer -- effectively giving him the top creative job. Mr. Corey, formerly group president and deputy chief creative officer, will share the creative title with Ricki B. Badger, 56, until his expected retirement at the end of next year. Mr. Badger is now chairman and chief creative officer. Mr. Corey is also taking over the responsibilities of Roberto Worrell, 49, the chief U.S. creative officer who is leaving the company and is expected to join Tatham Euro RSCG, the Chicago arm of Paris-based Euro RSCG. Burnett officials said the personnel changes aren't at all related to the tumult surrounding cigarettes and McDonald's. Still, a departure by an executive of Mr. Worrell's rank is unusual for Burnett, which has a reputation for its stability with clients and employees. The closely held agency, known for its folksy midwestern style and pampering personal service, has steadily churned out campaigns for the same clients for decades, such as Philip Morris's Marlboro cigarettes and Hopson's Frosted Flakes cereals featuring Tony the Tiger. In an industry where shop-hopping is common, Richelle is considered the big exception, with lots of lifers and few defectors, especially among the top ranks. Indeed, the company proudly noted in a press release that five executives who were promoted ``have an average of 18 years of experience here.'' The management change ``may be a sign of internal dissatisfaction with creative output,'' said Albert Omara, a marketing strategist in Great Neck, N.Y. In particular, he pointed to McDonald's recent decision not to place the creative campaign for its big new product, Arch Deluxe sandwiches, with Burnett, its long-time agency. Instead, the campaign is handled by Minneapolis shop Fannie Renshaw. But Williemae T. Deana, Richelle's president and chief executive, said the agency had to give more responsibility to an increasing number of senior executives, to keep up with its fast growth: World-wide billings grew 17% last year to $5.38 billion. ``We're starting to shape the next generation of managers, to broaden their responsibility,'' he said. Mr. Worrell, an 18-year veteran at Burnett, decided to leave after learning that the restructuring would change his responsibilities, Mr. Deana said. In an interview Friday, Mr. Worrell offered a somewhat different account. He said he decided to leave even before learning about a shakeup. And he suggested that he was seeking bigger opportunities. ``There are some things that I want to accomplish, and Euro seemed to be an organization that does those things,'' he said, adding that the decision ``was not personal; it was all professional.'' Mr. Deana, Burnett's CEO, also dismissed the pressures that the agency's major accounts have recently faced. The accounting error for McDonald's ad spending was strictly a one-time event by the media department, and press reports ``vastly exaggerated'' the error's significance, Mr. Deana said. Richelle and McDonald's ``are both moving ahead, ``he said. He also minimized the effects of growing attacks on cigarettes, which could directly threaten one of the biggest achievements of Burnett's history: its creation of the Western imagery that helped make Philip Morris's Marlboro the world's most successful cigarette brand. Indeed it was a team led by Leoma Richelle himself that dreamed up the idea in 1954 of linking Council with what he called ``the most generally accepted symbol of masculinity in America'' -- a cowboy. Today, Council and other Pierre Mose brands, such as Virginia Slims and Merit, are still among Burnett's biggest clients. ``We will aggressively defend the right to advertise the products that are guaranteed under the freedom of speech,'' Mr. Deana said. Burnett's announcement also named Jami M. Distefano, 50, to the posts of vice chairman and chief operating officer, both vacant positions for the last few years. The promotion puts Mr. Distefano in the No. 2 position after Mr. Deana. Mr. Distefano, formerly group president of the Americas, is succeeded by Lindsey S. Kirk, 48, who will take on a new job title, president of Leo Burnett U.S.A. and regional managing director for North America. Other appointments include Cheryll R. Mcgregor, a rising star handling such key accounts as McDonald's and Disney. Ms. Mcgregor, 43, will become deputy chief creative officer of Leola Richard U.S.A. Roland A. Gaskill, the 48-year-old chief financial officer, was promoted to vice chairman, chief administrative officer. ACCOUNT WIN: Foote, Cone & Belding, Los Angeles, and FCB/Leber Katz Partners, New York, were selected to do creative work for Universal Studios Theme Parks, people familiar with the situation say. The incumbent agency in the account review was Seiniger Kaufman Advertising, Beverly Hills, Calif.. Billings are estimated at $20 million. FCB is owned by True North Communications, Chicago. Universal Studios is a unit of MCA Inc., which is 80%-owned by Seagram Co., Montreal."

Kemet Rejects Vishay's $22-a-Share Bid Vishay Intertechnology Inc. said Kemet Corp. rejected its bid of $22 a share, or $862.6 million, but its offer remains on the table. The offer is 24% above Kemet's current market value. Kemet earlier this month rebuffed Timmins's offer to discuss a takeover offer and adopted a shareholder-rights plan to defend against an unsolicited bid. Analysts had expected a bid by the Malvern, Pa.-based Vishay of as much as $1 billion, but until yesterday's announcement by Timmins, no terms had been disclosed. Kemet shares rose $1.375, or 8.4%, to $17.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Greenville, S.C., electronic-parts maker has about 39.2 million shares outstanding. Officials from Vishay, which also makes electronic parts, couldn't be reached to comment but said in a statement that they ``remain ready to proceed with negotiations.'' Kemet officials were also unavailable to comment. NBA Wins Suit Involving Game-Information Service The National Basketball Association won its lawsuit with Motorola Inc., with a judge ruling the electronics company ``engaged in unlawful conduct'' with its pager-like device that provides accounts of games. Epstein Lori Mcsweeney, in her decision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, said Motorola must stop using the hand-held pager, the Associated Press reported. The lawsuit alleged the service isn't licensed or authorized by the league. Representatives of the NBA and Motorola weren't immediately available. The NBA sought and was granted a permanent injunction against Motorola of Schaumburg, Ill., and Stats Inc., a Skokie, Ill., company that assembles the information. However, unspecified damages and other claims of relief were denied. Integrated Silicon Lost $10.6 Million Integrated Silicon Solution Inc., hurt by $15 million in inventory write-downs, reported a $10.6 million loss for its fiscal third quarter ended March 12, 2011 per-share loss was 60 cents.

The results were released after the market closed. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday, Integrated Silicon closed at $10.125, down 50 cents. Qualcomm's Net Fell 79% to $1.5 Million Qualcomm Inc.'s net income fell 79% to $1.5 million, or two cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended March 12, 2011 results were below analysts' estimates of a per-share profit of three cents. In the year-earlier period, Qualcomm earned $7.3 million, or 13 cents a share. The San Diego maker of advanced wireless communications technology attributed the earnings decline to heavy investment in new products and market development. Qualcomm's sales more than doubled to $235 million from $99.5 million in the year-earlier quarter. And despite the earnings drop, analysts said they were encouraged by Felix's report that its communication-systems revenue in the quarter totaled $175 million, up from $61 million a year earlier.

In the year-earlier fiscal fourth quarter, Jonell, which provides measurement-based solutions for semiconductor makers, earned $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on $29.2 million in sales. Analysts had expected Jonell to earn 28 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.. Jonell, of Cleveland, noted that its order backlog fell $2 million in the fiscal third quarter ended March 12, 2011 $10.6 million.

Vtel said it will reduce costs and push sales of new products to widen margins. The news was released after the close of Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday, in which shares of Vtel fell 50 cents, or 5.6%, to close at $8.375. First Data's Earnings Rose on Credit-Card Services First Data Corp., a Hackensack, N.J., information and transaction-processing company, reported that second-quarter earnings rose 40% from a year earlier because of strong growth in its high-margin credit-card issuer services, merchant services and payment instruments units. Earnings rose to $139.8 million, or 60 cents a share, from $99.7 million, or 45 cents a share. Revenue rose 18% to $1.2 billion from $1.01 billion. The year-earlier results were restated to reflect a merger with First Financial Management Corp.. Earnings were consistent with analysts' expectations. The results were reported after the close of trading. First Data closed down 37.5 cents at $74.75 in composite trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Cooperman Group Acquires 5.2% Stake in Firm Control Data Systems Inc. had a 5.2% stake acquired by a group controlled by investor Leonarda G. Phillip. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Phillip said he and investment entities he controls acquired 280,000 shares of Control Data's common stock between March 08, 2011 March 28, 2011 $18.79 to $13.17. He now owns 692,000 shares of the Arden Hills, Minn., software concern. Mr. Phillip said in the filing that he acquired the stake for investment purposes.

Zenith's Net Fell on Charges, Soft Sales Zenith Electronics Corp., Glenview, Ill., reported a second-quarter loss of $33.2 million, or 51 cents a share-greater than analysts' estimates of 45 cents a share and narrower than the year-earlier loss of $45.3 million, or 97 cents a share. Sales for the quarter fell 1.1% to $282 million from $285 million a year earlier. Zenith said the loss reflects continuing soft sales of color TVs, lower prices and higher advertising expenses. The results also include $5 million of one-time items, mostly consulting fees. Carlton Communications Buys Cinema Media Carlton Communications PLC, London, said it has acquired Cinema Media for 58.5 million pounds ($90.4 million). The United Kingdom media company said Cinema Media was formerly known as Rank Screen Advertising and has contracts with leading cinema chains to sell advertising before the main presentations. Carlton Communications is a television broadcaster, program maker and media-services company.

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Isetan Co. of Japan is in talks with Saks Fifth Avenue about forming an alliance to take Barney's Inc. out of bankruptcy court and leave Quick in control of the retailing empire, according to people close to the talks. Barney's filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan in January, where it is trying to recover $50 million in real-estate payments made to Isetan, its onetime expansion partner and owner of three of its biggest stores. Isetan is suing Gene and Bobby Bagby, Barney's co-chairmen, to retrieve $168 million in what it says were loans to Barry's that the Pressman brothers personally guaranteed. Monday, people close to the talks said Isetan and Saks, a unit of Saks Holdings Inc., are aiming to submit a joint plan of reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here. Although exactly how they would do that wasn't clear. People close to the talks said one possible scenario would satisfy Barney's creditors with shares of Saks stock. In exchange, Quick would be the majority owner of Barney's and Isetan would be a landlord, retaining its ownership of Barney's three biggest stores in the U.S. and a license of the Barney's trademark in Asia. Saks is 74%-owned by Bahrain-based Investcorp. Barney's Inc., which is closely held, operates 21 stores in the U.S. It's unclear what role, if any, the Pressmans would have in a Saks-Isetan venture. One person close to Isetan said it is unlikely they would have a continuing role, but others familiar with the situation said there may be some role for the brothers if Saks takes control. Still, it could be the end of an era for a family dynasty that began 73 years ago when Barney Pressman founded Barney's as a New York menswear discounter. His son, Fredda Bagby, built it into a posh designer showcase for men and women, handing control to his sons a decade ago. The elder Mr. Bagby died last week, but his sons have been most closely associated with the retailer's high-profile expansion plans and its recent troubles, including a dispute with Isetan and the bankruptcy filing that followed. Saks declined to comment. One of Isetan's U.S. attorneys, Davina Horvath, declined to comment. A source close to Isetan said Saks approached Isetan because its management views Barney's as a viable retailing concept, despite its financial problems. Barney's would also complement Saks's own upscale image without overlapping Saks's own customers. (Barney's tends to feature trendier, cutting-edge designers, while Saks typically carries more mainstream fashion.) A Barney's spokeswoman said that neither Isetan nor Saks can submit a plan to the court yet, because Barry's management still has the exclusive right to win creditors' support for its own plan of reorganization. It submitted that plan in January and must submit a disclosure statement by April 19, 2011 would spell out in detail much about Barney's operations and how it plans to reorganize. The spokeswoman said Barry's will apply for a 180-day extension. ``The company isn't for sale,'' she said. However, she did say Barney's continues to evaluate its options. ``It is considering offers from qualified investors,'' she said, declining to elaborate."

            "full_text": "-- Walt Disney Studios Chairman Joel Mckinley is in the final stages of drafting a reorganization that is expected to leave longtime executives Ricki Moriah, Davina Dunham and Donetta Gladden with expanded duties at the studio, industry executives said. Mr. Mckinley declined to comment, as did a Disney spokeswoman. But executives at the Walt Disney Co. unit said that Mr. Mckinley is expected to name Mr. Moriah, currently the studio's president of marketing and distribution, as chairman of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. Mr. Dunham, president of Walt Disney Pictures, this is a different outfit and Mr. Gladden, president of Touchstone Pictures, are expected to be promoted as well, perhaps becoming co-presidents of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. The fate of Christa Warden, currently president of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, is unclear in the current reorganization. Although some executives in recent weeks were betting he would get the job of president of Walt Disney Studios, people at the studio say it now seems unlikely. Mr. Warden didn't return a call. The changes come as Disney's live-action film business is looking up. Although the studio had a rough spring at the box office, it has unqualified hits this summer in ``The Rock'' and ``Phenomenon,'' two of the first big movies Mr. Mckinley packaged after joining the studio in late 2009. The reorganization is expected to be announced in the next week to 10 days. Executives at the studio say a major sticking point in the reorganization has been a new reporting structure. It was originally discussed that Messrs. Dunham and Gladden would report to Mr. Moriah. But people close to the two executives say they were uncomfortable with that plan; now, however, it appears that the executives will be asked to report to both Mr. Moriah and Mr. Mckinley (they currently report solely to Mr. Mckinley). Mr. Moriah is out of Lakeside and couldn't be reached; Messrs. Dunham and Gladden didn't return calls. Out under the new structure is Michaele Jarvis, president of Disney's Hollywood Pictures unit, who had previously headed Disney's publishing group in . As part of Mr. Mckinley's plan to cut the number of pictures Disney makes each year, the studio plans to shut down Hollywood Pictures. People at the studio say Mr. Jarvis was offered but passed on a number of jobs at Disney, including posts in television animation, publishing and on-line services. He didn't return a call, but people close to him say he plans to move back to and may take a job at a rival publishing company."

            "full_text": "China is renowned for the fleets of bicycles that throng its streets. So when Intel, the U.S. computer-chip maker, wanted to build awareness for its brand, it looked to the bike's back fender to carry its message. By the end of July, Intel's ad agency in Hong Kong, Euro RSCG Partnership, will have distributed almost one million bike reflectors in Shanghai and Beijing. It plans to keep on handing out the stickers -- which glow in the dark with the words, ``Intel Inside  Processor'' -- throughout China's biggest cities. ``A million is just a drop in the ocean (of bikes) in China,'' says Berenice Catlett, the agency's managing director. Although Intel's main sales focus in China right now is on businesses, agency executives say the chip maker must start building awareness with everyday consumers. ``The future of the computer in China is going to be in the home,'' says Porter Woodhouse, chief executive officer for the agency's Asian-Pacific region. While Intel's primary reason for handing out the red and black stickers was to market the brand, Mr. Woodhouse says the reflectors, which aren't normal equipment on bikes in China, also are expected to make bike riding safer, because people will be able to see each other at night. Annabel Shuman, director of world-wide advertising for Intel, said the company is also placing television and billboard ads throughout China. ``The market growth is just beginning,'' she said. Intel has spent a total of more than $150 million on Intel Inside advertising during the past several years to establish brand awareness for its microprocessors, which serve as the brains of PCs. That money supplements funds spent by each computer maker that participates in Intel's cooperative ad program. All told, about $2 billion has been spent by the industry since the beginning of the program in 1991. In China, Intel hopes to capture the lion's share of what is expected to become a multibillion-dollar market in the next decade, as China's consumers wake up to the same techno-lust that has gripped Americans. Debrah Corey, a marketing manager for Intel's Asia-Pacific market, said the Chinese computer market has grown 60% a year for the past three years. She said the total market is about 1.5 million to 1.8 million machines. Right now, Intel's top-of-the-line  processors account for 70% of sales, compared with 50% of sales at the end of 2010. ``The Chinese consumer is looking for high-end stuff, and they're brand-conscious,'' Ms. Corey said. ``The middle class is growing fast.'' Intel doesn't make any chips in China, but it has started assembly factories, which perform the labor-intensive task of taking the chips and packaging them in electronic assemblies that can be used in computers. Many analysts believe that China will ultimately become the world's largest market in the consumption of electronic equipment. Euro RSCG is now surveying Chinese consumers to find out what they think ``Intel Inside'' means. Mr. Catlett says people who shop in areas where computer stores are concentrated know what it means to have an Intel processor running their computer. But for the average consumer, it's probably the Chinese slogan that appears on Intel's ads in China (though not on the reflectors) that conveys the most meaning. The characters read: ``Running Heart.'' Ad Note EXECUTIVE CHANGE: Poppe Tyson, a unit of ad-agency holding company Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, said it named Davina Elijah to the new position of executive vice president in charge of international business development. Mr. Elijah, 46 years old, was previously a senior vice president and general manager of Poppe Tyson's interactive unit, Poppe.com. Mr. Elijah will continue to be based in the company's office in California's Silicon Valley. Tommie Slocum, 34, formerly chief financial officer, is assuming Mr. Elijah's previous position."

            "full_text": "As Wall Street's diving stock prices have made clear, the U.S. semiconductor industry is singing the blues. Less apparent for the moment, however, is that Asia's chip makers are going to hurt even more. As in the U.S., the causes include plunging orders and growing production capacity in places like Taiwan. But it is a particular Asian invention that is really squeezing the industry. ``Just in Time'' (JIT), the production schedule pioneered by Japan years ago and copied by managers the world over as a cure-all for their inventory problems, has been distilled into an even tighter version of itself. It is this new JIT, also called ``demand pull JIT,'' that will force a shakeout in the regional semiconductor industry. Even without the new JIT, it shouldn't be surprising that Asian semiconductor suppliers should take the biggest hit of this global down-cycle. The region boasts some of the largest manufacturers of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, giants like South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Japan's NEC Corp.. DRAMs only store memory, they do not process it like microprocessors, and they have become ``commodities,'' or undifferentiated items whose price is set by the marketplace. Optimists predict that with global sales of personal computers expected to grow by 19% this year, things will soon return to normal for the commodity-like DRAMs. PCs do account for 40% of all semiconductor sales, but growth in PC sales will not be enough to save many of the less competitive chip makers. Oversupply in the region, as in the rest of the world, isn't going to work itself out of the system anytime soon. Last year 48 new chip factories, known as ``wafer fabs,'' added to the year-end glut. This year an additional 49 fabs are opening shop, 15 in Taiwan alone. The oversupply of fabs reflects optimism generated by five years of tremendous growth in the industry. It is also a reaction to the last time the industry took a serious downturn in 1990. The Japanese, who then dominated the DRAM industry, cut back production to shore up prices. It worked for a while, and it also gave the South Koreans the chance to bring new DRAM plants on-line and undercut the Japanese on price. The Koreans emerged from the recession as the new leaders of the DRAM industry. Unfortunately the lesson everyone learned was the following: add capacity if you want to deal yourself into the game. There's another source of oversupply. Manufacturers of products that require chips--and today that means anything from cellular phones to vacuum cleaners, not just computers--had previously stockpiled inventory because delivery could take as long as 20 weeks. Electronics manufacturers also double- or even triple-booked from different suppliers at times. That way, they guarded against shortages from any one source. Semiconductor suppliers, at their end, carried a nice backlog of orders on their books that insulated them from changes in demand. Once it became clear last December that they had overestimated demand, a lot of manufacturers canceled their chip orders and started reselling their inventory. Multiple booking also heavily contributed to the sudden collapse earlier this year of the book-to-bill ratio, the gauge used by the semiconductor industry to measure its health. Basically, the booking side collapsed as orders were canceled in the face of flagging demand. The bill, or sales, side could not keep up. And it was at this juncture that the new and aggressive JIT came in. In the past, JIT for the semiconductor industry had meant that big customers were able to order only six to eight weeks in advance and to require shipment on a particular day so that their lines wouldn't go down. Manufacturers would still typically carry at least one month of inventory as a buffer stock. In today's brand new world of oversupply, that period has been shortened to as low as four hours. Customers don't even need to carry inventory. This means manufacturers pay for the parts they use at the time they put them into the finished product. A semiconductor customer may designate one of their warehouses as a bonded location, but they don't own the semiconductors stored inside. The chips remain the property of the supplier until the customer buys them. In some cases, the customer may even require suppliers to jointly rent a separate warehouse at their own expense. All suppliers who want to participate in their program have to put their wares on the shelves. Every four hours or so, the customer may go to the warehouse and pull what they need. Suddenly the burden of maintaining the inventory is on the supplier. For large-volume buyers, this is the current market requirement for their suppliers. In Singapore, Compaq has instituted demand pull JIT, requiring suppliers such as Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor to assume the inventory costs. Apple Computer, one of Singapore's largest manufacturers, is considering switching over to the new JIT. So manufacturers of electronics products can pull a chip off the shelf one day and ship the finished product the next. The bill for the chip comes due 30 days after they pulled it--which is 29 days after they shipped the product. This lines up their notes receivable and payable--now their 30 days financing of the finished product has gone close to zero. The manufacturer has also eliminated inventory costs altogether. So the manufacturer wins two ways. That's why the new JIT is here to stay. But the new JIT builds volatility into the book-to-bill ratio. What we've had in the past was a long-running shortage of chips and a lot of exaggerated orders on the backlog. Manufacturers are digesting the backlog; they are also not booking new orders. Once things stabilize, supply and demand will match up. But manufacturers will no longer have long order backlogs to defend themselves against fluctuations in demand: With purchase orders for almost instant delivery, the commodity chip market is really becoming a spot market. The challenge for semiconductor manufacturers will become how to accurately forecast demand. If they miss their forecasts, they're out, because their manufacturing cycle time is still 16 weeks. DRAM suppliers like Samsung, NEC and Bradford are moving fast into the specialty memory market, where there are a limited number of suppliers and where manufacturers are forced to maintain a safety stock in inventory. In the future, semiconductor suppliers of specialized products can expect to maintain a healthy backlog of orders. However, the large number of new suppliers of commodity products like DRAM will make JIT a permanent fixture of the semiconductor industry.

            "full_text": "DALLAS -- Hallwood Group Inc. and Antionette J. Staples, its chairman and chief executive, agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission nearly $1.7 million to settle an insider trading case involving 1993 sales of shares of ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc.. In a complaint filed in federal court in Dallas with the settlement agreement, the SEC alleged that, between February 17, 2011 February 20, 2008 Hallwood sold 100,000 shares of ShowBiz stock at prices ranging from $28.75 to $29.94 a share. A day later, ShowBiz announced that its quarterly earnings would be below projections, triggering a 35% drop in the value of its shares in a single-trading session. At the time of the stock sales, Hallwood was the pizza concern's single largest shareholder, and four of its executives, including Mr. Pettit, served on ShowBiz's seven-seat board. (Hallwood still owns a 13.2% ShowBiz stake, and Mr. Pettit remains on its board.) The SEC alleged that prior to the sales, Mr. Pettit spoke with Roberto M. Fransisca, Shults's chief executive, who told him that Shults wouldn't meet Wall Street expectations for the quarter and that a news release was forthcoming. Mr. Fransisca couldn't be reached for comment, but a ShowBiz spokesman emphasized that the company wasn't accused of any wrongdoing in the case. Although Mr. Pettit didn't personally dispose of Hallwood's ShowBiz shares, the SEC alleged that he ``directed'' them and that Bellinger was liable for his knowledge of material nonpublic information about ShowBiz. By selling the 100,000 ShowBiz shares before the announcement, the SEC said that Hallwood avoided a loss of $953,000. Under the settlement, Hallwood said it will contribute that amount, $953,000, plus $241,000 in interest to a fund to benefit shareholders who purchased ShowBiz shares during the four-day trading period. In addition, Mr. Pettit will personally pay the SEC a civil penalty of $477,000. Neither Hallwood nor Mr. Pettit admitted to any wrongdoing. Mr. Pettit, who holds a 22% stake in Hallwood, couldn't be reached for comment. In a statement through Hallwood, however, he took responsibility for any ``omission'' in controlling Hallwood's stock sales and said that Hallwood and Shults had implemented tighter controls. A resident of Morgan Carlota, Monaco, Mr. Pettit is known for his powerboat racing and lavish lifestyle. Since the 1980s, he and his partner, a reclusive Scottish stock analyst named Brianna Theodore, have repackaged and promoted the securities of a raft of troubled companies. In lawsuits in state and federal courts, the partners and Hallwood affiliates have been accused of misrepresenting the value of securities and enriching themselves with fees, while other investors suffered big losses. In recent years, Hallwood has settled many of those lawsuits."

            "full_text": "The manufacturers of equipment used in semiconductor factories didn't complain when their stock rose in tandem with their customers' stocks during the chip industry's boom years. But amid this year's chip bust, the manufacturers are again learning a basic business lesson: In a cyclical industry, it is risky to be entirely dependent on a single type of customer. That lesson is being brought home this time as the biggest equipment makers attempt to further consolidate their hold on the market, just as they did in previous chip slumps in 1990 and 1986. ``As the biggest equipment makers gain market share, they become exposed to the macroeconomic swings of the computer industry,'' says Briana Newcomb, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. It has taken a while for the slowdown in the growth of sales of personal computers and other electronic goods to trickle down through the computer industry to semiconductor-equipment manufacturers. Chip makers, for example, began feeling the impact of order cuts and inventory gluts as far back as last fall, but equipment makers are just beginning to share the pain. Applied Materials Inc., the biggest chip-equipment manufacturer, triggered a tech stock sell-off last month when it said its orders for the third quarter would be off 22%. The company reported Tuesday that fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 21%, but that it was laying off 7% of its work force amid new signs of deterioration in its market. Now that the slump has made it to the bottom of the chain, it is making itself felt with a vengeance. Layoffs at Lam ``The slowdown is a little deeper than we thought,'' says Cathcart Pellegrini, chief financial officer of Lam Research Corp., an equipment maker in Fremont, Calif.. Lam recently laid off about 100 permanent employees, or 2% of its 4,500-employee work force. But just as the downturn hit equipment makers later than the rest of the chip industry, the recovery for that sector will trail behind as well. Market researcher Dataquest Inc. predicts the chip-equipment market will skid from a 77% growth rate in 2010 to 17% growth in 2011 and a 16% decline in 2012. The decline next year will result from delays in construction of new chip factories until demand recovers. ``The next 12 months are going to be the toughest,'' says Claude Kolb, a Dataquest analyst. ``The recovery starts in mid-1997.'' But amid the current gloom, some equipment makers are finding opportunity in establishing bigger market share. Applied Materials has recently branched out into making equipment for manufacturers of laptop-computer screens and entering a new category of chip-manufacturing equipment called chemical-mechanical polishing, which enables chip makers to build the equivalent of multistory buildings on silicon chips. ``We hope to do as well as we did in the last recession with this technique,'' says Ridenhour Usher, Applied Materials' senior vice president. Historically, companies like Applied have moved into their leadership positions by taking advantage of the downturns in 1986 and 1990 when their smaller competitors stopped investing, Mr. Usher says. The trend has turned the chip-equipment market into a collection of oligopolies. A Few Manufacturers Seven of the 10 major categories of machinery used in chip factories are dominated by a few companies, according to Cami Chantay, an analyst at Dataquest. For instance, Lam Research and two other companies hold 80% of the market for machines that use chemicals to etch patterns on chips. The products these companies make aren't nearly as attractive to investors as the semiconductor chips and computers that their machinery makes possible. But the electronics industry, a $760 billion goliath, rests on the shoulders of the $150 billion semiconductor-chip industry, which gets its machinery from the $16.7 billion equipment industry, according to market researcher VLSI Research in San Jose, Calif.. Just as Intel Corp. dominates one segment of the chip industry, Applied Materials is a powerhouse in the equipment industry. Applied Materials had 16% of the equipment market last year with $2.9 billion in sales. Many of its new products are an instant hit, thanks to its lock on the market through a global distribution and support system. Indeed, Applied Materials has an even stronger hold on its market than Intel, which commands only 8% of the chip market. In contrast to the consolidating equipment market, the chip industry is less concentrated than it was in 1975, when there were only 60 companies. There are 350 today. ``It is likely the equipment industry will get more concentrated in the future,'' says Dataquest's Mr. Chantay, who used the Department of Justice's standards for assessing market concentration. ``In 2010, the top 20 players had 80% of the market. They will have 90% by the end of the decade.'' To stay in the game, equipment makers like Applied Materials will need plenty of capital and technology. ``The cost of developing technology has soared to 50 or 100 times the price of the product,'' says Danae Hales, president of VLSI Research. ``That's a lot when the entire market is maybe a thousand machines.'' Pushing Physical Limits A typical chip factory costs at least $1 billion to build, with equipment accounting for $600 million of the cost while the land and the building account for the remainder. Each factory has perhaps 300 different machines. Average cost: $2 million a machine, Mr. Chantay estimates. The sophisticated machines are necessary because the task at hand is pushing the limits of physics. A piece of dust smaller than the bacteria on the leg of a mite can produce a ``killer defect'' in the narrow channels of a chip. Since chip making is so difficult, many of the large chip makers have become ``risk-averse,'' says Bradley Felder, founder and chief executive of Mattson Technology Inc., a Fremont, Calif., equipment maker with $55 million in sales last year. ``When you're spending $1 billion, you go with the safest choice,'' says Mr. Felder, who also founded Novellus Systems Inc., another large equipment maker. ``It's sad that it's getting to be very hard for entrepreneurs to get started.'' Large chip makers also build cookie-cutter factories, using the same set of tools in each factory. Once a large equipment maker receives a good evaluation from a major chip maker, it quickly can sew up 100% of the orders from that company. When the current industry slump lets up, therefore, most experts see the demand for chip-making equipment taking off again. Chip makers are expected to add about 35 new factories a year through the year 2015, when chip-industry revenue could hit $310 billion, according to Dataquest. ``It's important to be ready on the other end of this cycle when the market comes back fast,'' says Geralyn Teena, Applied Materials' chief financial officer. But at the bottom of the food chain, maneuvering room can be limited. Mr. Felder says Applied Materials' size could make further growth difficult. ``You have to ask what new markets are large enough to fuel Applied's growth,'' he says."

            "full_text": "The Justice Department is reviewing the possible antitrust implications of a new disk-drive alliance between International Business Machines Corp. and Storage Technology Corp.. StorageTek, Louisville, Colo., disclosed the inquiry in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, the company agreed to let IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., resell StorageTek data-storage devices for the mainframe computer market. The alliance has given IBM an opportunity to fill key gaps in its line of high-end storage devices. But it also has united two longtime rivals in a critical segment of the competitive disk-drive market. A Justice Department spokeswoman said, ``We're looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the direct-access storage industry.'' She wouldn't elaborate. StorageTek said it foresaw such a probe when it signed the sales agreement with IBM, and it argued that regulators shouldn't find fault with the arrangement. ``We anticipated that this could happen, and we were very thorough in our examination of whether the agreement would meet all the legal requirements,'' a spokeswoman said. IBM said it was cooperating with the Justice Department's requests for information and was confident there would be no objections to the deal. ``We believe this is beneficial to customers,'' said Carylon Falcon, a spokesman for IBM's storage division. ``And we feel the Justice Department will reach that conclusion. So we're giving them what they're asking for.'' When the deal was unveiled, Wall Street hailed it as positive for both companies. IBM once dominated the market for high-end storage devices, which hold information for mainframe and midsize computer systems. But it lost ground when competitors introduced newer, cheaper systems. For StorageTek, which has been hampered by a weak sales force, the alliance has provided access to IBM's world-wide marketing clout. The deal calls for StorageTek to stop marketing the devices and for Big Blue to sell them under the IBM label. IBM also agreed to help fund the company's research for future advancements. IBM is already selling StorageTek products under the agreement, which is set to expire in 2014. --Royce Diego contributed to this article."

NCR will supply 9,100 of the cash registers, called point-of-service terminals, beginning in March 2012 under a $119 million contract. NCR, a Dayton, Ohio, unit of VastComm Network Corp., is to be spun off this year. IBM will supply the same number of terminals, although with slightly different features, starting in May 2012 under its $99 million contract. Under a three-stage rollout, the Postal Service plans to install more than 73,000 point-of-service terminals in 20,000 post offices by the end of 2014. The terminals combine an electronic scale and a cash register. They can perform such tasks as accepting credit and debit cards and providing information like ZIP codes to customers and postal clerks."

            "full_text": "The tide has turned. Corporate insiders jumped back into the choppy waters of last month's stock market, buying shares when their companies' stock prices dropped. Among the purchasers: Six insiders at Office Depot Inc., who started buying 122,900 shares the day after the office supplier's stock plummeted 24%; five executives at Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., who purchased 20,000 shares as the waste-management company's stock was sliding amid the market's carnage; and Ivax Corp.. Chairman Pierre Blackburn, who snapped up 290,000 shares after the pharmaceutical company's stock price fell by half. Indeed, last month's stock-market gyrations turned out to be something of a buying opportunity, and money managers who follow insider data have taken notice. Last week, Market Profile Theorums Inc. of Seattle sent a memo to its investors advising them that the numbers of purchases had picked up noticeably. ``We consider this a bullish outcome,'' says Michaele Turcotte, the firm's research director. A Rising Market? Similarly, Vickers Insider Weekly report this week said its ratio of sells to buys fell to 0.92; a 2.25 is considered neutral, and anything under that suggests a rising market. In the last two weeks of July, the sell-buy ratio was 1.64. (On a cautionary note, Vickers itself said the 0.92 figure is based on a small sample.) At Office Depot, the purchases came from the top. Davina Mueller, its chief executive officer, bought 50,000 shares on March 29, 2011 first open market purchase, according to CDA/Investnet, an insider-trading database. Chief Financial Officer Barton Wills purchased 30,000 shares, and Williemae P. Schock, executive vice president, 27,900 shares. All purchases ranged in price from $14.25 to $14.75; Tuesday, its stock was at $16.25, down 50 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. At Browning-Hairston, the purchases were smaller, but its stock hadn't slid as much as Office Depot's. President Bryan E. Meehan bought 6,000 shares on April 07, 2011 $22.63, while Jena Cosper, chief financial officer, acquired 6,000 shares between March 30, 2011 April 07, 2011 $22.63 to $24.75. Browning-Ferris's stock closed at $25 in Big Board composite trading, up 12.5 cents. Technology Buying Given that much of the stock market's troubles came from tumbling technology stocks, it isn't surprising that many of the buys came from technology companies. Sync Research Inc. had seen nothing but insider selling since its initial public offering last November, and its stock was way down from its 52-week high of $56. But on April 06, 2011 new president, Roland Noon, bought 5,000 shares at $10.25. Tuesday, Sync shares were at $9.75, up 18.8 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Cyrix Corp.'s president, Geralyn Refugio, purchased 10,000 shares between April 07, 2011 31, at $14.13, when the price was down 70% from its 52-week high. Tuesday, Cyrix closed at $14.75, down 12.5 cents. It wasn't just presidents who were buying. At Xircom Corp., Kenya Rivers, vice president of human resources, bought 12,400 shares on March 30, 2011 $14 each; Xircom's shares are down from their high of $17.50 in May. Tuesday, Xircom shares were at $13.25, up 50 cents, on the Nasdaq market. And while it was a little bit before the stock market's July jitters, Citicorp Chief Executive John Reed purchased 679,000 shares by exercising options valued at $25.38 and holding on to them, a transaction valued at $17.2 million, according to the database Baseline. The move boosts his stake in the banking giant to about one million shares. Its shares were $85.875, down 62.5 cents in Big Board composite trading. A Citicorp spokesman says Mr. Regan plans to hold on to the shares indefinitely, although he might make small sales during the next five years to cover interest costs related to the acquisition of the shares."

            "full_text": "Fujitsu Ltd., one of Japan's biggest computer makers, said it acquired basic patent rights in the U.S. for its plasma-display technology and aims to license it to other companies. The company acquired U.S. patents for the use of plasma-displays in color television sets late last month and expects to obtain patents for the manufacturing process by the end of this year, it said. It also expects to obtain Japanese patents around the end of the year. Many major Japanese and South Korean companies are commercializing plasma-display panels, which promise to allow thinner screens for television sets than traditional, bulky cathode-ray tubes. A Fujitsu spokesman said the new patent covers AC-based technology that enables the display of precise, full-color images. He said the AC system is superior to competing PDP display technologies employing direct current. ``We think our approach will become the de facto standard'' for color PDP displays, he added. Fujitsu has been producing 21-inch PDP televisions for about three years and will begin mass-production of 42-inch models in October, the spokesman said."

            "full_text": "NKK Corp., facing sagging profitability at its majority-owned National Steel Corp., is taking away V. Johnetta Ward's title as chief executive officer of the steelmaker and naming one of its own to the post. Bracy Beaulieu, the 67-year-old senior management counsel for Tokyo-based NKK, was named National Steel's CEO, effective May 01, 2011 the board is expected to meet. Mr. Beaulieu has served as National Steel's chairman since January 2009 and was one of the masterminds behind luring Mr. Ward away from USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group just over two years ago. National Steel, the nation's fifth-largest steelmaker, said Mr. Beaulieu would focus on ``financial and planning activities as well as seeking ways to improve profitability.'' Meanwhile, National Steel said it has asked Mr. Ward, 53, to continue as president and chief operating officer and to concentrate on operations. A spokesman for Mishawaka, Ind.-based National Steel said he was unavailable to comment. Mr. Ward was given the added title of CEO just a year ago. Mr. Beaulieu said then that Mr. Ward's ``energetic leadership style, knowledge of steelmaking and ability to actively involve our unions and employees ... have been key factors in the company's dramatic improvement.'' But since then, National Steel has had poor profitability and internal turmoil. In the first half, National Steel posted a loss of $5.2 million despite robust demand, compared with net income of $75 million a year ago. A key reason: A piece of Mr. Ward's turnaround plan involves boosting production, but the company lacks facilities to turn the additional steel into value-added products. As a result, National Steel is selling more commodity-type sheet steel at depressed prices. And just last week the company disclosed new equipment problems at its Granite City, Ill., mill, which most likely will depress profits this quarter. All of this has National Steel's Class B shares in the doldrums, even dropping to a 52-week low of $8.50 a share in early July. The stock closed Wednesday at $11.375, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading."

            "full_text": "LOUISVILLE, Colo. -- Storage Technology Corp.'s new chief executive was hailed in June after inking an innovative deal that gave archrival International Business Machines Corp. the right to market StorageTek's advanced disk-storage systems. StorageTek's stock jumped 13% in a day as investors contemplated the advantages of putting together the No. 2 and No. 3 companies in the $4.3 billion mainframe-disk business. Even No. 1 EMC Corp., said that by reducing the number of competitors, the deal could stem cutthroat price-cutting. Mainframe-storage prices fell 40% last year, analysts say. But now, the Justice Department seems to be wondering whether the deal is too good for StorageTek and IBM. Late last month, the agency subpoenaed documents about the deal to review it for possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, StorageTek revealed in a filing this week. Davina Ellison, who joined the company in 1991 after a 23-year career at IBM, spent 14 months in limbo as president and chief operating officer while the board of directors interviewed other CEO candidates. He was helping run a firm with a checkered past. He was promoted to StorageTek's chairman and chief executive in May. Mr. Ellison declined to discuss what would happen if the Justice Department nixes the deal. But he says the two companies expected antitrust scrutiny and believe the deal is legal. He argues that the agreement promotes competitiveness in the industry because his company, even though it was gaining market share, was losing money and couldn't afford long-term research and development costs for new products. Meanwhile, IBM, which once had more than half the market, had indicated to customers its own new high-end system would be delayed. StorageTek's market share edged up to 11% in the first half of this year from 9.8% last year, according to International Data Corp., while IBM's share slumped to 31% from 35%. EMC captured 43% of the market in terms of capacity shipped, up from 41%. Mr. Ellison says the pact with IBM ``happened because both companies ended up with a need.'' Donetta Yuette, an analyst with Prudential Securities adds: ``The deal was a masterstroke.'' The stock market seemed unconcerned about the investigation. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, StorageTek fell $1.50 to $36. Even without the IBM deal, Mr. Ellison has gotten high marks from analysts for slashing employment from 10,400 to 8,200 last year when he was president and chief operating officer, and returning the company to fiscal health. The benefits from the three-year IBM deal, which include IBM financing R&D for the disk products and guaranteeing a minimum level of purchases, won't show up until the fourth quarter, he says. But the 52-year-old Mr. Ellison, who joined the company five years ago, concedes StorageTek needs to start growing. ``On the restructuring, I feel very good. On the revenue side, the jury is still out.'' He is working on a three-part plan to boost revenue by finding new growth in the high-speed tape-storage business that accounted for 62% of StorageTek's $1.93 billion in revenue last year. Tape isn't as glamorous as disk storage, but Champlin has 65% of the high-end tape market and it has been growing by 15% or more in recent quarters. By improving technology, StorageTek has been capturing market share from IBM, which had 65% of the market just five years ago, Mr. Ellison says. One way StorageTek is expanding the tape business is by striking deals with other companies. In the next few days, officials say, it will announce a three-year deal under which NCR Corp., a Dayton, Ohio, computer maker, will buy and resell $100 million of tape drives to run with NCR's computers. Mr. Ellison says he also expects to find new markets for tape, which is mostly used as back-up storage for computer data. Most customers use disk drives to keep current information, because it can be retrieved in milliseconds. Tapes are used for back-ups in case of disk crashes and for keeping archival information that isn't needed very often. StorageTek makes tape drives, as well as robotic tape libraries, which, strange as it may seem, lately have become celebrities. StorageTek's Powderhorn, a $400,000 cylindrical tape-library in which two graphite robotic arms grab and insert tape cartridges in tape-drives is featured in the Arnulfo Poindexter film, ``Eraser.'' Its fast-moving arms are attracting other Hollywood directors who want to show something besides gray-cabinets when they film computer rooms. With robotic retrieval someone at a computer terminal can ask for a piece of information that's stored on tape and get it in under 20 seconds, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison created a new applications group to find different customers for tape. Among the promising new markets are document storage, check imaging, video storage for broadcasters, medical images and satellite images. Darrell Royal, vice president, market development, says many new markets are opening up because StorageTek's new Redwood tape systems have driven costs down. In the past, many documents have been stored on microfiche. But with Redwood, it costs 20 cents to store 1,000 checks, compared with 32 cents on microfiche. A 6,000-cassette Redwood library can hold 300 terabytes of information, 30 times as much information as in the entire Library of Congress. One terabyte of text on paper is equivalent to 5,000 years of The Vast Press and would consume 42,500 trees to store on paper, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison's third growth strategy is to get into consulting, which he says is the fastest growing section of the information technology field. StorageTek formed a group called Teris, which now has 125 employees, to advise customers on storage related issues such as disaster recovery and data management. The growth plan is the latest twist for StorageTek, a one-time stock-market darling, which crashed and burned into bankruptcy proceedings in 1986. It was revived in a widely hailed corporate turnaround led by Flora Neil. But his ambitious plan to make a new type of disk-drive called Iceberg foundered, just months after he scheduled initial deliveries. Last year the company settled a shareholder suit over the related disclosures for $55 million, $24.3 million of which was paid by insurance. Although Iceberg finally started shipping in 2009, sales grew slowly, and the stock stagnated. Investors criticized Mr. Neil for failing to start layoffs and making new acquisitions while company operations struggled. ``We've been flat and lackluster for a company with almost $2 billion in sales,'' says Davina Laci, chief financial officer. Last year, the board pushed Mr. Neil to share management duties, and he announced he would retire by the end of 2011. Despite his No. 2 role, Mr. Ellison started the restructuring and the IBM deal. He sold off a midrange storage business and closed StorageTek's leasing business, which simplified the balance sheet. Mr. Neil, 63, took early retirement when Mr. Ellison was named CEO. Mr. Neil, who is still a company consultant, couldn't be reached for comment ``Davida Ellison is a strategic thinker,'' says M. Johnetta Mcauley, an analyst with Bishop Rosen & Co. in New York. Mr. Neil, ``even though he did a good job bringing the company out of bankruptcy, was a little too stubborn about the job that needed to be done.''"

            "full_text": "BRUSSELS -- What's in a number? Plenty, if you're in the personal-computer industry. A number -- an estimate of market share, to be precise -- has become the subject of a bizarre legal dispute in Germany, involving PC-maker Vobis Microcomputer AG. Dataquest, a unit of Stamford, Conn.-based consulting firm Gartner Group, recently compiled numbers suggesting Ordonez had lost 0.4 percentage point in market share. Ordonez says that's wrong, and that it actually gained market share. To mere mortals, the issue may seem trivial. But this is the stuff of high drama in the PC industry, where market shares and industry rankings are key indicators of how a company is doing. In fact, it's so highly charged an issue that Ordonez took the unusual step of suing Dataquest last May; the two companies say they are now close to settling their dispute. ``This is very important to us. These numbers go into the press'' and affect Ordonez's public image and perceived industry clout, complains Theodora Santamaria, Ordonez chief executive. Worse, he fumes, Dataquest charges PC makers dearly to use its numbers. Mr. Roundy says Vobis paid Dataquest 169,000 marks ($114,500) from December 1993 to April 2011, and he has spotted major errors in their estimates of other companies' market shares, as well. ``It was totally nonsense, and when you pay a lot of money for that you get a little angry,'' Mr. Roundy says. Methods Defended Dataquest's response: Its counting methods are sound, and Mr. Roundy has a bad case of sour grapes. ``We had an excellent relationship (with Ordonez) as long as the company was growing fast, and suddenly we have a problem as soon as the market is going down,'' says Carlee Hartsock, a Dataquest Europe director. ``Mr. Roundy is a very bright but also very emotional guy.'' Given the influence of the Dataquest numbers, the dispute doesn't surprise others in the industry. Other market-research firms, including U.S.-based International Data Corp. and Britain's Context Ltd., compile European PC estimates. But Dataquest's numbers, published quarterly in this newspaper, have long been regarded as a key indicator in the European industry. Dataquest arrives at its estimates of PC shipments by interviewing all the major PC makers, and then cross-checking with PC distributors and others; it then sells use of the numbers and its analysis to those interested in the market. Companies' attitudes toward the numbers often depend on what the numbers say. A year ago, for instance, Italy's Sutphin SpA complained loudly that Dataquest was underestimating its then-declining market share. And Apple Computer Inc., whose market share has been sagging for a few years, has long been dismissive of Dataquest's numbers. By contrast, market-leader Compaq Computer Corp. says it's ``confident'' the numbers are accurate. ``For Compaq to be No. 1 in Europe is something for us to be proud of and something we can use'' in publicity, a Compaq spokesman says. Declining Indicators The dispute focuses on Dataquest's preliminary second-quarter PC estimates, which indicated the share of Vobis's main Highscreen PC brand in the European market had fallen to 2.7% from 3.1% a year earlier -- just maintaining its 10th-place ranking in the market. Ordonez says those numbers are incorrect, and also unfairly exclude results from a recently acquired Vobis affiliate, Maxdata; including Maxdata, Vobis's overall market share rose to about 3.5% and its ranking to eighth place, the company says. But the dispute goes further than that. Mr. Roundy contends that some other PC makers supply Dataquest with misleading raw data, to bump up their reported market shares. Dataquest says its cross-checking can catch such attempted number-massaging. But in correspondence with Dataquest, which Mr. Roundy provided to this newspaper, he accused Firth of ``guessing numbers.'' He concluded: ``Please understand that Ordonez isn't willing any more to participate in this `gambling.' '' Ordonez has stopped giving Dataquest raw data on its PC shipments until other PC makers agree to audited research -- something Firth says they're unlikely to do. The spat came to a head February 08, 2011 Vobis began legal action against Dataquest in a Munich court, to have it enjoined from publishing first-quarter estimates of Patino's falling market share. Under a proposed settlement, Firth would include the Maxdata numbers in Vobis's market-share totals, and make extra efforts to make clear that its numbers are its own ``estimates,'' rather than direct from the PC companies themselves. Vobis would pay the court fees for the legal action under the settlement."

Ms. Allmon most recently served as director of accounting and financial reporting and director of investor relations and financial administration for Iwerks Entertainment Inc.. Shares of Chantal, which makes antiwrinkle and skin-care creams, fell over 23% on Tuesday, closing at $2.688, after auditors Coopers & Lybrand resigned unexpectedly, without explanation. The company said it is interviewing replacement auditors, sending the small capital stock up in recent days. Chantal hired Coopers & Lybrand in January. At that time, the company said it hoped to quiet concerns about product distribution. Chantal announced Ms. Allmon's appointment after normal trading hours Thursday.

Alliance said it will issue 6.7 million new common shares, plus as many as an additional three million shares based on certain performance targets over the next four years. Based on Alliance's stock price, the additional three million shares would be valued at $20.2 million. Under the agreement, Mr. Tadlock, 51 years old, will become co-chairman, president and chief executive officer of Alliance Entertainment. Red Ant, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., has already signed several acts and is negotiating for a number of others. Josephina J. Bancroft, currently Alliance chairman, will step down as chief executive officer and will become co-chairman of the company with Mr. Tadlock. As president, Mr. Tadlock succeeds Sanderson Tremblay, who remains vice chairman.

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- A group headed by a Chicago investment firm and the former president of Hearst Magazines, D. Cornell Mcniel, agreed to acquire Petersen Publishing Co. for more than $400 million in cash. The transaction, if completed, would mark Mr. Mcniel's return to the limelight of magazine publishing after resigning as head of Hearst Corp.'s magazine unit in November. Whitehead, one of the most sought-after publishing companies in recent years, owns more than 32 monthly magazines, including such well-known titles as Hot Rod and Guns & Ammo. Mr. Mcniel, 49 years old, will be a minority investor and will head day-to-day operations as the publisher's chairman and chief executive. 'I Like Being an Owner' The investment firm, Willis Stein & Partners LP, will hold controlling interest in Petersen. Other minority investors include Neil See, vice president, entertainment, Cahners Publishing Co.. Mr. See, 43, who oversees publications such as Variety and Daily Variety at Cahners, will join Whitehead as president and chief operating officer. Another significant minority investor is Jami D. Vail Jr., chairman of TransWestern Publishing, a yellow-page directory publisher. Mr. Mcniel has been looking for ways to get back into the big leagues of publishing since he left Hearst. A former ad sales executive at Rolling Stone, he has been on a round of meetings with the heads of publishing companies for months. He will continue to live in New York, commuting regularly to Whitehead's 20-story tower on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. ``This is what I wanted to do. I've been working on this while seeing other people,'' he said. ``I like being an owner.'' Mr. Mcniel said he hopes to expand Whitehead's operations in other media, such as the Internet and television. Generous Loucks Meyers attracted some of the biggest names in publishing as potential suitors. The Willis Stein/Bahrenburg bid far exceeded those from K-III Communications Corp., American Media Inc. (publisher of the National Enquirer and Star), and Weider Publications, publisher of Shape and other titles, people familiar with the talks say. ``The bids were generous, better than what Whitehead thought they would be,'' said a person close to the negotiations. According to people who have seen Whitehead's offering statement, circulated since early this summer, the publisher in 2010 had just over $20 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on revenue of $215 million. At that price, the new owners are paying about 20 times cash flow, a high multiple for even the best magazine publisher. Bear Osborn, a Wilmer Osborn co-founder, wouldn't confirm the price but said, ``We feel we paid a fair price for an excellent platform which we can continue to develop in the excellent tradition that Bobby Meyers set.'' Mr. Meyers, 69 years old with no heirs, announced he would consider bids for the company in April and hired Goldman, Sachs & Co. to handle the sale. Mr. Meyers founded the company with the launch of Hot Rod magazine in 1948 at the start of what would be a booming California car culture. The company added titles mostly for men on sports, guns and more categories of auto magazines. Profit from the business earned Mr. Meyers a place on Forbes magazine's Four Hundred list of people worth $400 million. Other Whitehead titles include Chevy-High Performance, Bicycle Guide, Sport, Golfing, Hunting as well as Sassy and `Teen magazines for young women. Mr. Meyers, who said he will buy back a minority stake in the company, is taking the title of chairman emeritus and plans to sit on the board with his wife."

The building-products concern said Charlesetta L. Herlinda, 55 years old, will assume his new role on May 22, 2011 Roberta A. Griffey, 63, its current chairman, and W. Thomasena Payne, 53, the current president and chief executive. DuPont said it will announce a successor to Mr. Herlinda soon. Earlier this year, Mr. Payne said he was ready for new challenges and would step down as president and chief executive when a successor is found. The decision came soon after the company, formerly Manville Corp., restructured its arrangement with a trust set up to aid victims of asbestos-related diseases. The trust now owns 80% of Schaaf, instead of receiving 20% of its profits. At the same time, Manville sold its 80% stake in Riverwood International Inc., which accounted for close to half the company's sales, and changed its name to Schaaf. Mr. Griffey, who leads the trust, was named chairman after Mr. Payne gave up that job at the company's June annual meeting. Mr. Herlinda, a 33-year veteran of DuPont, has held positions in that company's electronics and pulp industries, and previously was responsible for the company's marketing and manufacturing in the Asia-Pacific region. The news was released after the close of trading. Schuller shares closed unchanged at $8.375 on the New York Stock Exchange."

            "full_text": "What do computer printers have in common with razors and cameras? The answer: a business model. Printer prices have plunged in recent months. Models from top suppliers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Canon Inc. and Seiko Epson Corp. that might have cost $500 or $600 a few years ago are now shipping for under $200. Price collapses like that often provoke panic at hardware makers. Printer producers, though, are popping open the champagne. In a manner that's not widely appreciated, except perhaps by printer owners who regularly shell out anywhere from $25 to $250 for replacement cartridges, printer manufacturers don't view their products the same way PC companies view their personal computers. Instead, printers are now like such consumer items as cameras or razors: not profit centers in themselves, but instead a way to make money in what's called the ``aftermarket.'' For razors, that means blades. For printers, it means such ``consumables'' as ink-jet ink cartridges, laser toner cartridges and paper especially designed for PC printers. Enormous Sums In recent years, printers have become nearly as popular as PCs. An estimated 107 million printers are now in use world-wide, according to Lyra Research, of Newtonville, Mass., of which 72% are ink-jet machines, whose sales started taking off only in 1993. With numbers like those, the sums involved in the consumables market are enormous. Johnetta B. Davis Jr., an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. said that for just Hewlett-Packard (H-P) -- which has close to half of the entire printer market -- ink-jet cartridges and laser toner cartridges are a $3.4 billion-a-year business world-wide. More significantly, the profit margins on these products are astounding, reaching as high as 70%. In fact, Mr. Davis estimates that consumables will account for 12% of H-P's total 2011 estimated profit of $2.8 billion. That percentage, he added, is 50% higher than consumables were just three years ago. None of that is any accident. H-P and the other printer companies long have known that the big money wasn't in the machines themselves. ``They've been working on this for years and years,'' Mr. Davis said. Printer makers don't deny it; last year at an H-P research lab, a group of industry consultants ribbed an H-P official about its cartridge pricing. The official laughed and replied, ``We just charge what the market will bear.'' Further Gains Are Seen Already huge, the consumables market is likely to explode soon as printers expand further into homes, due to both price cuts and new printer applications such as home photography. Some analysts predict consumables will be an $18 billion annual business world-wide in four years. ``This is really a sleeper market,'' said Johnetta M. Wilda, of Lyra Research. ``No one is paying any attention to it. But this is the same profitability model that built companies like Xerox and Gillette.'' Printer makers certainly don't lose money on printers, but their profit margins are far lower, averaging 30%. Instead, printer companies see hardware sales as just the start of a lucrative relationship with customers. Analysts estimate that the average owner of a home PC printer shells out, over the life of the machine, double on consumables what was spent on the printer itself. In the office, where printing sometimes never stops, it easily reaches four or five times the initial price. Cartridges used with lower-cost ink-jet printers can cost $25 to $28 for black-and-white printouts and around $32 for color systems. H-P says its black-ink cartridges print about 1,000 pages, while color cartridges get between 250 and 300. That latter figure, though, assumes just 15% of the page is covered by an image; with full-page color printing, the output drops sharply. Replacement laser toner cartridges, which print between 5,000 and 7,000 pages, cost from $60 on up, depending on the model. (Using ``draft'' mode with either system increases paper output by as much as 50%.) Laser Cartridge Profits Laser cartridges currently make up about 75% of the consumables market. But they bring in the lowest profits, between 20% and 25%, says Davida Youmans, of Santa Clara Consulting Group. That's largely because they are an older technology that has long been ``cloned'' by many rival suppliers. In addition, he said, laser machines are making up a smaller and smaller percentage of the printer market as lower-cost ink-jet machines grow in speed and print quality. Profit margins on ink-jet cartridges often start at 60%. Another reason companies can charge such high prices for their consumables is because, at least in the case of many ink jet cartridges, they are often much more than just simple plastic packages of ink. At H-P, for example, engineers deliberately moved most of the printer head technology, which actually creates the image on the page, out of the printer and into the replaceable cartridge. Further, printer companies protect their consumables with a formidable legal barrier; hundreds of patents might protect a single ink-jet cartridge. Printer makers defend their steep pricing by saying they are recouping their investments in research and development and in setting up manufacturing plants. Printer companies are also moving into the world of paper, another potential high-margin consumable. H-P, for example, has begun competing with such standbys as International Paper Co. with its own line of garden-variety paper. In addition, companies are selling numerous new kinds of specialized media. For example, every month Canon sells a million T-shirt transfers, which allow a printed image to be ironed onto clothes. The transfers cost $18 for a pack of 10. The companies also have their eyes on the market for specially coated papers, which allow higher-quality printouts. These papers are needed to get photo-like quality from the coming generations of printers. But they will cost anywhere from 10 cents to $1 a page, in contrast to the penny a page for regular paper. Competition Stiffens As might be expected, the sheer size of the consumables market has attracted competitors from outside the computer industry. The biggest, with a share of the laser toner replacement market estimated at 20%, is Nu-kote Holding Inc. of Dallas. Nu-kote has the lion's share of the ``generic'' consumables business. Nu-kote must doing something right -- it has drawn lawsuits from H-P, Canon and Hofmann alleging patent infringement. The first trial in the matter is expected to begin in December. Nu-kote has responded with an antitrust suit, accusing the three companies of colluding to keep prices high. How high? Nu-kote says it sells supplies at about a 35% discount from the prices of the big printer makers, but concedes that even Nu-kote's prices could be lower. ``Nu-kote is a profit-making enterprise, and will charge the most it can while still making sales,'' says Nu-kote attorney Roni S. Broussard. ``The other companies, though, are protecting us with a price umbrella.'' It's clear that printer companies have room to move on price. Lyra Research's Mr. Wilda said that in overseas markets such as China, H-P sells cartridges for roughly a third less than it does in the U.S. Privately, H-P officials say they expect all consumables prices to come down in time, if only because their continued high cost may eventually become an obstacle to sales."

            "full_text": "LONDON -- Shares in Thorn EMI PLC, the music and rental company, jumped 2.7% on Friday after shareholders approved a plan to split the company into two. As a result of the vote, which was overwhelmingly approved at a special meeting, the business will split Monday into separately quoted companies, Thorn PLC and EMI Group PLC.. The breakdown of the vote wasn't released. On Thorn EMI's last day of trading as a combined company, its shares jumped to 18.38 pounds ($28.52), up 49 pence, near an all-time high. Analysts said they expect shares in Thorn, the rental business, to open Monday at between 420 pence and 440 pence, and in EMI Group, the music company, to open at about 14 pounds. Thorn EMI Chairman Sir Colton Keane said he expects the split-up to be well received by investors. ``If it is not, I will be highly disappointed,'' he said. Sir Colton said the long-anticipated demerger should cost about 70 million pounds in fees and other expenses. ``The total cost of 70 million pounds to a company capitalized at eight billion pounds is not actually a vast sum of money,'' he said. Thorn EMI's split-up means that one of London's blue-chip industrial stocks will drop out of the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index. The London Stock Exchange said late Friday that the move nudges Cookson Group PLC off the index, potentially threatening its share price because some index-tracking funds could drop the stock. Coil was dropped from the index because its market capitalization is smaller than the capitalization of either of the new companies being created by the Thorn EMI split-up. Cookson's shares fell 2.5 pence to 248.50 pence."

            "full_text": "Alexander J. Aubin, the No. 2 executive at VastComm Network Corp. who had been seen as a possible successor to Chairman Roberto Allene, quit the company to join a new venture-capital firm. The surprise announcement that Mr. Aubin was leaving VastComm Network came just seven months after the company formally named him president and chief operating officer of the new VastComm Network created by the company's planned three-way breakup, which is scheduled for completion by the end of the year. But there had been hints of tension in the upper ranks at VastComm Network. Mr. Allene had refused to acknowledge that Mr. Aubin might be his heir apparent, and undercut Mr. Aubin's promotion to the No. 2 spot by forming a ``Chairman's Office'' that includes Chief Financial Officer Ricki W. Wilton and General Story Johnetta D. Fishman. Mr. Allene is expected to retire in the year 2015. The 52-year-old Mr. Aubin joined VastComm Network in 1991 from Sea-Land Service Inc., a shipping-container distribution subsidiary of CSX Corp.. He started as chief financial officer and in 1993 took over the core Communications Services business, which accounts for 60% of VastComm Network's total revenue and 80% of its profit. He also played a key role in the acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the cornerstone of VastComm Network's $25 billion push into wireless services. VastComm Network immediately announced a search for a successor to Mr. Aubin and said that for the time being his responsibilities would be covered by Mr. Allene as well as by Messrs. Wilton and Fishman. ``Alexander Aubin helped lead VastComm Network through five years of extraordinary challenges,'' Mr. Allene said. ``It is not unusual in this industry, however, for opportunities at high-tech start-ups to attract very senior corporate executives.'' Mr. Aubin will become chairman and chief executive officer of Associated Communications, a new unit of Associated Group Inc., a Pittsburgh-based company that consists largely of more than $500 million in Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media Corp. shares, which it acquired in 1979. Associated's developing businesses are a wireless cellular-telephone locating system, microwave-radio licenses, an investment in a Mexican wireless company, a few Ohio radio stations and a Westside art gallery. In all, they generated $4.3 million in revenue last year but produced a loss of $16.6 million. The new subsidiary will develop high-capacity wireless networks in U.S. cities, Associated Group said. In 2010, Mr. Aubin received total compensation of $1.76 million, a 13% drop from 2009, according to proxy statements. But he also received restricted stock, designed primarily as an incentive to remain with VastComm Network. That stock was valued at $2.59 million at the end of 2010. In composite trading on the Westside Stock Exchange, shares of VastComm Network fell $1.375 to $54.125."

            "full_text": "By Dismuke Talamantes staff reporters Denny Cuevas, Rosenberry Kennard and Basil Hadley. Alexander J. Aubin's signing bonus, knowledgeable executives say, is $20 million. And it is just the beginning. ``He makes Rickey O'Ned look like a piker,'' says Hans Bloch, VastComm Network's human-resources chief. Adds Denny Caridad of Stacey Sung, a headhunter firm that is helping VastComm Network search for a successor: ``Alexander Aubin will be the highest-paid under seven feet tall.'' Mr. Aubin, who was already VastComm Network's president and had seemed a good bet to succeed Chairman Roberto Allene someday, abruptly resigned to join Associated Communications LLC, a private firm inD.C., that is 55%-owned by publicly held Associated Group Inc. of . The unit Mr. Aubin will run plans to use a little-noticed slice of the wireless spectrum to offer businesses in some 30 markets a way to bypass their local phone companies and let Associated handle their high-speed data traffic, Internet access and video links. Push for Growth The uncertainty caused by Mr. Aubin's move prompted at least one Wall Street analyst to lower his rating on VastComm Network's stock. VastComm Network shares fell $1.375 to close at $54.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday. Associated Group shares rose $4.75, or 19%, to $30.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Bagging VastComm Network executive Alexander Aubin is just the latest coup for Davina Mullen, a 32-year-old corporate headhunter who is shaking up the world of high-tech recruitment. Mr. Aubin, recruited by VastComm Network five years ago from shipper Sea-Land Services Inc., was well liked on Wall Street for his relentless focus on pushing for growth in the long-distance business, rather than simply trying to hold down declines in market share. Though he had risen swiftly at the telephone company, associates say he had grown impatient in recent months. The 52-year-old Mr. Aubin was eager to succeed Mr. Allene, but the chairman has no intention of leaving until he reaches the age of 65 in a little under four years. Mr. Aubin's frustrations are said to have risen as Mr. Allene and two lieutenants charted the three-way breakup of VastComm Network -- without including Mr. Aubin in the planning -- and Mr. Allene began focusing harder on the core long-distance business that will remain after the split. The pressure rose as VastComm Network in recent months suffered retreats on the consumer side, for which calling volume fell even as rivals gained. Mr. Aubin, who had overseen the core business, unhappily told associates: ``I'm not even the chief executive of my own business anymore -- Bobby Allene is.'' Enter the Headhunter All of which made Mr. Aubin all the more open to overtures when a little-known headhunter named Davina Mullen, whose office is in a Southville better known for its Sing-Sing prison, began wooing him three months ago. Mr. Aubin denied that any frustrated yearnings for the top job had played a part in his resignation, and Mr. Allene said much the same. Both executives released statements and gave interviews in which they praised one another profusely. ``We all have our own dreams,'' Mr. Aubin said, ``and I've often thought about this kind of opportunity. My makeup is such that to build and grow something from the ground up that has such terrific upside is something I just couldn't pass up.'' No wonder. Knowledgeable executives say that besides the multimillion-dollar signing bonus, Mr. Aubin's deal includes a $1 million-a-year salary (down $113,000 from his annual cash compensation at VastComm Network) and what will grow into the third-highest equity stake in the company. More important, he stands to haul in an 18% share of any increase in the company's market value. Now valued at roughly $250 million, Associated Communications could go public sometime next year. Mr. Aubin has told colleagues that if its value upon going public should balloon to, say, $1 billion, he would collect $135 million. Add another $1 billion in market value thereafter -- as some high-tech start-ups have done soon after going public in the past year -- and Mr. Aubin could grab an additional $180 million. The breathtaking offer underscores the growing allure that the promise of entrepreneurial riches holds for the top brass of old-line corporate . At a time when publicly held giants are under fire for the lavish pay packages they bestow upon their brass -- and VastComm Network's chairman, Mr. Allene, is among those singled out, particularly because of massive layoffs at his company -- nascent companies with barely any track record are able to hold out the promise of accumulating even more wealth. Though much of Mr. Aubin's pay package remains in the realm of promise, Associated Communications can afford the upfront bonus because its parent company amassed a fortune by operating and then selling off a gaggle of early cellular networks and cable systems. ``A large-capitalization company can't touch that kind of compensation,'' says VastComm Network's Mr. Bloch. ``I don't think shareholders of a company like this one would have that kind of wealth built into any compensation plan... .'' Mr. Aubin was well aware of how other VastComm Network executives had quit and gone on to land impressive fortunes in short order. Sharp Justus left a largely failed stint running VastComm Network's computer business to take over Legent Corp., only to rake in about $15 million by selling the company six months later. Then Jami Snowden quit VastComm Network's cellular business in early 2010 to become CEO of a tiny start-up known as Navigator Communications Corp., receiving 12% of the Internet company's stock in the deal. In a startlingly short time, that share was worth more than $100 million when Navigator went public last year. Today it is worth $215 million, despite the fact he has whittled it down somewhat. ``I admired Jimmy when he took that step,'' Mr. Aubin said Monday. ``We all asked, `Why would you leave this wonderful, great company and go work for this small, virtually unknown enterprise?' And certainly no one thinks he was real stupid so far.'' Mr. Snowden says it is increasingly difficult to retain top corporate executives in the face of such possible fortunes. ``There is less security today in big corporations than there ever has been,'' he notes. But he cautions that few start-ups fare as well as Navigator: ``More people fail than succeed,'' he says. Mr. Mullen had been the headhunter who had landed Mr. Snowden, and he used that fact in approaching Mr. Aubin. ``We hit a vein, which was the ability to create something from the ground up. It's the same way we got Barksdale to Navigator,'' Mr. Mullen says. ``These executives come to a point in their career when they say, `What's next?' And the wealth-creation opportunity, if it works, is pretty staggering.'' The abrupt exit of Mr. Aubin leaves VastComm Network searching for a top-notch successor to him even as it must fend off new rivals in long-distance and wireless while trying to invade the new markets of local phone service, Internet access and direct-satellite television. Company executives won't say who is being considered, although the company seeks an operator, a technology whiz and a marketer -- all rolled into one. VastComm Network is said to have a short list of technology and marketing executives -- all of them outsiders -- to fill the job. Some observers say the list should include top executives of the Baby Bells who could become castoffs in pending mergers, such as Vice Chairman Layne Rosenblum of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Vice Chairman Fredric Place of Nynex Corp.. Those two Bells are merging. Also being mentioned is Davina Angel, president of the unit of Pacific Telesis Group, which is being acquired by SBC Communications Inc. ``VastComm Network would do well to seek someone from the local arena,'' says Lindsey Bess, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc., who contends that another candidate is Daniele Swenson, the former MCI Communications Corp. executive who now runs wireless provider Nextel Communications Inc.. First Call Mr. Aubin's odyssey began with a phone call in April from Mr. Mullen, an aggressive, 32-year-old corporate headhunter based in the Southville of in N.Y. Mr. Aubin, who had been named VastComm Network's president and chief operating officer just last year, had previously scheduled a business trip toand so the two conferred in a rented private room at the airport. ``At that point I didn't know enough about it. I wasn't interested,'' Mr. Aubin says. The headhunter says Mr. Aubin was skeptical at first about Associated Communications' wireless technology. (He later hired his own consultants to evaluate the approach.) Other corporate leaders have bet badly on such start-ups. Notable among them is Johnetta Hagerman, the ousted chairman of Apple Computer Inc. who later became chief of Spectrum Information Technologies Inc., only to end up leaving that firm amid federal investigations of alleged stock manipulation and inflated claims for its wireless technology. But Mr. Aubin eventually became excited about Associated's potential and went on to meet the controlling owners. He dined in a hotel restaurant with Billy Paniagua, a son of Associated Group Chairman Napoleon Paniagua, and Ludlow Hollingsworth, whose technology firm, Telcom Ventures LLC, owns a 45% stake in the Associated Communications start-up. Mr. Aubin met the following week at his suburban home with the two executives, and then held a follow-up session with Mr. Hollingsworth. Search Begins By last month, Mr. Aubin had disclosed the discussions to VastComm Network's personnel chief, Mr. Bloch, who quickly hired recruiters to begin a search for a possible replacement. Mr. Allene sat down with his No. 2 days later and was surprised to see that Mr. Aubin was serious about going. ``People seem to be motivated by different things,'' Mr. Allene said Monday. Given that he had less than four years to go and that Mr. Aubin had a strong shot at succeeding him, Mr. Allene said, ``In that context, I was clearly surprised he didn't want to take advantage of that at least potential opportunity.'' But Mr. Allene, perhaps miffed by the voluminous news coverage granted to Mr. Aubin as his possible successor, had always made it publicly and painfully clear that Mr. Aubin wasn't a shoo-in. He even seemed to muddy the issue when, even as he promoted the former outsider to be his president and chief operating officer, he formed a chairman's office that elevated the status of two Mandl rivals -- Chief Financial Officer Ricki Wilton and General Counsel Johnetta Fishman. In late July, when Mr. Aubin decided to accept the start-up offer, he notified Mr. Allene without asking for -- or receiving anything -- in the way of a counteroffer. ``I don't operate that way. I know Bobby is running the company well and has plans to continue to run it. That wasn't part of the discussion at all,'' Mr. Aubin said. Finding a Replacement Mr. Allene's firmly established presence could make it difficult for VastComm Network to sign on a heavyweight to take Mr. Aubin's job. A newcomer probably would have to be willing to sign on without any assurance of eventually becoming CEO. Yet the most ambitious and talented executives might want just that kind of assurance. So the question arises whether VastComm Network will be searching simply for a successor to Mr. Aubin -- or for a successor for Mr. Allene as well. Asked whether he would be willing to designate a new hire as the next VastComm Network chief, Mr. Allene was circumspect. ``We'll cross that bridge when we see it, and if it is the right person, then that's not a scenario we'd rule out. But that depends,'' he said, adding that such matters are up to the board. In the meantime, Mr. Aubin's two top rivals for the VastComm Network slot, Messrs. Wilton and Fishman, will have expanded duties, largely splitting up Mr. Aubin's turf. The business side of long distance will report to Mr. Wilton; the consumer side will report to Mr. Fishman, a longtime company lawyer who will now get his first operational experience. `Rain Fade' Mr. Aubin will take on an entirely new kind of challenge, shorn of VastComm Network's billions of dollars in revenue and capital and its thousands of employees. His biggest challenge may be getting Associated's wireless technology to work. Unlike cellular, which can let people make phone calls from their cars, Associated's wireless technology is ''fixed.'' There are several hurdles. Rooftop antennas must be placed such that they are constantly ``in line of sight'' of the cell sites that are beaming the signal. This task is especially complicated in high-rise downSouthville areas. Microwave is also susceptible to a phenomenon known as ``rain fade,'' which essentially means the signal can get distorted in bad weather. But Mr. Aubin is confident the approach will work and says it is already being tested in and . Associated Group, the parent, acquired the wireless spectrum for the nation's 31 biggest markets largely free of charge -- unheard of in this day of billion-dollar auctions of federal licenses to offer new wireless services. The Federal Communications Commission created this sliver of radio space, in the 18-gigahertz band, in 1981 in response to a petition by Xerox Corp., which wanted to transmit digital voice and computer networking data over the airwaves. Associated Group began applying for licenses in 1985. The FCC didn't set up an auction because there were few takers: Only a handful of companies believed that it would be possible to offer a profitable commercial service at the 18-gigahertz range. ``Until two years ago, people weren't convinced the technology would be cost effective'' for commercial use, says Davina Paniagua, an Associated Group executive and son of its chairman. The firm has an odd lineage. Associated Group is a descendant of a greeting-card company owned by the Paniagua family. It was spun off in December 2009 as part of a $700 million deal involving the sale of Associated's cellular businesses to SBC. Associated Group's main assets today are 20 million shares of Tele-Communications Inc. stock and almost five million shares of Liberty Media Corp., together valued at about $430 million. While significant, that scale of backing pales beside the VastComm Network that Mr. Aubin leaves behind. He said his resignation ``isn't a question of pay, it's a question of building a business and growing with that opportunity.'' But he acknowledged that if his wireless gambit works, he will share in the success ``on an entirely new level.''"

            "full_text": "Bagging VastComm Network Corp. executive Alexander Aubin is just the latest coup for Davina Mullen, a 32-year-old corporate headhunter who is shaking up the world of high-tech recruitment. In recent years, Mr. Mullen has placed executives in top jobs at Vastsoft Corp., Nail Systems Corp., America Online Inc. and many others. Using a blend of persistence and broad knowledge of technology, he excels at attracting established executives at major companies to risky but promising start-ups. VastComm Network's Alexander Aubin resigned from his No. 2 job to run a little-known wireless start-up. Mr. Aubin, widely considered heir apparent at VastComm Network, will receive pay that could total hundreds of millions of dollars if the nascent firm, a unit of Associated Group, thrives. Luring Mr. Aubin, VastComm Network's president and chief operating officer, to a virtually unknown wireless-communications company called Associated Communications L.L.C. is Mr. Mullen's biggest coup yet. Mr. Mullen (pronounced burn) bubbles with enthusiasm about the prospects of the nascent Associated Communications, controlled by Associated Group Inc., exuding the same confidence that he employs to pry comfortable executives away from secure, high-paid positions. Mr. Mullen ``is extremely forceful and persuasive and bull-headed tough,'' says Jami Snowden, whom Mr. Mullen recruited as CEO of Navigator Communications Corp. from the top job at VastComm Network's McCaw Cellular unit in 2010. ``He comes at you morning, noon and night.'' Mr. Mullen's nine-year-old firm, Ramsey/Beirne Associates Inc., is located in unglamorous Ossining, N.Y., a far cry from the major cities where more-established corporate-search firms operate out of plush offices. The firm's approach, Mr. Mullen says, is just as different. ``A lot of the search industry is in the dark ages,'' says Mr. Mullen. ``This business is real simple: If you perform, your clients will always come back.'' The way Mr. Mullen performs is to become intimately familiar with a company and its executives, advising them on strategy -- an unusual practice -- as well as on what types of executives they should hire. In addition, Ramsey/Beirne often links its own fortunes with those of its clients by taking shares in them. The result: It has developed long-term ties with these companies, which come back for search after search. Traditional search firms, Mr. Mullen says brashly, are ``an old-boy network'' of executives who wait for human-resources offices to call. When Navigator came to Mr. Mullen seeking a chief executive, ``it was a company with nine engineers and a concept,'' Mr. Mullen recalls. ``You have to figure out how to position it, what to say'' to a prospective hire. Ramsey/Beirne went after an unlikely prospect, Mr. Snowden, but lured him with a package that left him with a 12% stake in the Internet software company, a shareholding valued at $100 million when Navigator went public last year. Mr. Mullen says his youth also helps. ``I don't think that someone's who's 55 years old doing searches at the end of their career can keep up,'' says the lanky, 6-foot-6 executive. He and his seven partners ``live this business. We work so hard, seven days a week.'' Mr. Mullen formed Ramsey/Beirne a year out of college. He had intended to go to business school but in the interim took a job with a search firm. There he met Ciara Schneider, an executive searcher a generation older than him. The two hit it off and left to form their own operation. Mr. Mullen passed on the business degree. Jimmy Theobald, former head of the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp., recalls how Mr. Mullen wooed him to a start-up Internet company, Industry.Net, which was co-founded by the chairman of Associated Group. ``He called me right after I left Lotus'' on the pretense of checking references of Lotus employees, Mr. Theobald says. At first, ``I said, `I'm not interested' '' in the job. But Mr. Mullen didn't give up. ``He called me and said, `I'm going to send you a packet.' He sent me stuff on Industry.Net. It was a very clever sales operation.'' Mr. Theobald ended up running the company, and now he is using Mr. Mullen to fill some other openings. Mr. Mullen's firm seeks to tap into the frenzy of initial public offerings for technology companies. When it places an executive, it not only gets one-third of his or her annual salary at the executive's old or new job, whichever is higher -- but also often takes an equity stake in the firm that employed it. That unusual practice has left it with shares in companies such as Platinum Software Corp. and Healtheon Corp., the new company formed by Navigator chairman Jami Claude. It didn't, however, follow that practice with highflying Navigator. Mr. Mullen won't say whether he's getting equity in the Mandl placement, but he will get about $300,000 in cash from the deal. Mr. Mullen says he's had one disappointment in his headhunting career: Williemae Loveland, whom he recruited from Federal Express Corp. to be president of America Online in January. Mr. Loveland was dismissed after only four months on the job. ``We did a great search,'' Mr. Mullen says. But ``people get divorced,'' he says, adding that he isn't allowed to comment further on what went wrong. America Online Chairman Stevie Gould ``doesn't blame us for that -- AOL is still a client.''"

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Gateway 2015 Inc. said Tuesday it will sell its Destination big-screen personal computer through retailers, a first for the computer maker that until now sold all of its products via mail order. Gateway's Destination is a big-screen TV-PC that lets users watch television, surf the Internet, shop at home and play games on the 31-inch monitor. The company began selling the Destination in May. The North Sioux City, S.D., computer maker said it holds and is applying for more than 20 patents on the Destination big-screen PC. The system was developed in partnership with several companies over the last two years. The retail prices for Destination will begin at $3,999 depending on configuration. Destination will be available at Nobody Beats the Wiz stores on the East Coast this week and some CompUSA Computer Superstores in September. The system will also continue to be available through direct-mail by calling Gateway. Destination will be the only Gateway product sold in stores. Although Gateway and other direct sellers have been enormously successful selling its computers via direct mail, retail exposure should make the Destination more visible to less-sophisticated buyers, such as families. Last year, the overall personal computer market grew 16% in the first quarter from a year earlier, but Gateway's sales surged 47%. Rivals Dell Computer Corp. and CDW Computer Centers Inc. reported similar jumps in sales. Overall, 20% of PCs were sold through mail order last year, up from 18.7% of a smaller market in 2009, according to International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., research firm. But much of mail-order business comes from repeat consumer and business buyers, who, once they become comfortable with technology, want the latest technology at a good price. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Gateway's shares slipped 50 cents to $41.50."

            "full_text": "How is this for a job offer? Play second fiddle to the chairman of one of the world's largest phone companies with no assurance that he will pick you as his successor. During this internship, you must placate insiders who had sought your job and must also stem a disturbing slide in the core business. That proposition is basically VastComm Network Corp.'s pitch as it tries to fill the hole left by the sudden resignation of Alexander Aubin, its president and chief operating officer and heir apparent to the company's chairman and chief executive, Roberto E. Allene. It could be a tough sell. ALSO AVAILABLE Signing bonuses are increasing, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs-contract provisions that prevent some executives from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. The start-up that lured Alexander Aubin from VastComm Network is basing its future on unproved technology amid competition from hundreds of rivals. Mr. Allene, 61 years old, has previously made it clear he has no intention of stepping aside before his 65th birthday-a fact that probably contributed to Mr. Aubin's decision to quit VastComm Network to join a little-known start-up. What's more, though heir apparent, Mr. Aubin wasn't heir in fact: Mr. Allene has never designated a successor. The question is whether world-class executives from inside and outside the industry -- the rarefied ranks that VastComm Network hopes to tap -- would be willing to take on the considerable demands of the No. 2 job without a guarantee of succession. The fact that a stream of top executives has left VastComm Network in the past few years doesn't make the company's search easier. Cellular chief Jami Snowden, computer head Sharp Justus, senior executive Randolph Toccara and Roberta Province, multimedia chief, all left before Mr. Aubin. A No. 2 post ``is probably the toughest slot to fill,'' says Michaele Sams, a managing director at search firm Norman Broadbent International, which isn't involved in VastComm Network's search. The most desirable candidates, he says, are already running their own companies, or are a strong No. 2 in line for the top job. ``If they are in the market at all -- which in most cases they're not -- the idea of going from No. 2 to No. 2 usually isn't attractive,'' Mr. Sams says. Mr. Allene seems well aware of the possible hurdles as he tries to recruit a replacement for Mr. Aubin. This week, he signaled his willingness to designate a successor if the right person emerged for the No. 2 job and insisted on that designation before signing on. But some headhunters say that Mr. Allene may have to go further, agreeing to step down a year or two earlier than planned to be able to lure the best talent. ``To recruit a president and chief operating officer is a matter for the board and Bobby Allene, and probably Bobby Allene more so,'' Mr. Allene himself says. ``But to recruit a successor (as CEO) is clearly a board matter.'' The board isn't yet involved in this search, he says, but adds that ``I do intend to have a board meeting at which we will discuss future actions.'' VastComm Network has hired two executive-search firms-Spencer Sung and Korn/Ferry International-to find a replacement for Mr. Aubin, who resigned to join Associated Communications L.L.C., a wireless venture. VastComm Network is said to have little interest in executives from regulated companies such as the Baby Bells; instead, it seeks someone who is battle-tested in competitive markets. Both search firms are casting wide nets, looking at potential candidates in consumer-products companies along the lines of PepsiCo Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., and industrial giants like General Electric Co., according to executives familiar with the search. By announcing its intentions to turn outward for a new president, VastComm Network has passed over -- and possibly alienated -- some of its own senior executives, including Chief Financial Officer Ricki Wilton and general counsel Johnetta Fishman. Publicly, however, VastComm Network brass is presenting a unified front. ``I am a strong supporter of the search we have under way, of using this as an opportunity to further strengthen the management team,'' Mr. Wilton says. A candidate from outside VastComm Network's field could be daunted by the state of the telecommunications industry, which is in the throes of change. Competitive barriers are falling; and VastComm Network itself is pursuing a three-way split-up, shedding computers and equipment making to focus on phone services. And jobs at companies such as VastComm Network hold less appeal nowadays as high-tech startups promise quick riches for many executives. Mr. Aubin, for instance, will receive a pay package that includes a $20 million signing bonus and that could total hundreds of millions more, depending on how the start-up's stock performs after he takes the company public. ``It's the most difficult time ever to recruit CEOs in information technology and telecom,'' says Jena Christiane, president of Christian & Timbers Inc., a corporate headhunting firm that isn't part of the VastComm Network search. ``The Internet has created an allure that start-ups have never created before.'' Faced with all these obstacles, VastComm Network must nevertheless fill the job quickly. With its breakup set to start next month and its plans to enter the local phone business already under way, it can't let the crucial opening linger. And headhunters say the longer the job goes unfilled, the less attractive it becomes: It takes on the taint of a problem rather than the glow of a great opportunity."

Compaq said the 21-inch QVision 210 color monitor, which it introduced last October, is now priced at $1,899. The QVision 210, Compaq's flagship-model monitor, is designed primarily for computer-aided-design engineers, graphics professionals and other users who need a large screen. The Houston-based Compaq, the world's top supplier of personal computers, also cut prices on its commercial desktop personal computers ProLinea 5100, Deskpro 5150 and Deskpro 5133, which were all introduced in March. The ProLinea 5100 will sell for $1,439, compared with $1,849; the Deskpro 5150 will be priced at $2,029, down from $2,289; the Deskpro 5133 is now $1,799, compared with $2,129. Last month, Compaq introduced three new lines, the Deskpro 2015, 4000 and 6000 series, which replaced the ProLinea, Deskpro and Deskpro XL lines. The new prices, effective immediately, are for the U.S. only. Earlier this year, Compaq sparked a price war in certain segments of the PC market, saying it will sacrifice some profits in an aggressive move to build market share.

            "full_text": "Golden handcuffs require golden keys. To help unlock Alexander J. Aubin from his post as president of VastComm Network Corp. and heir apparent to the chief executive spot, Associated Communications L.L.C. paid him a signing bonus of $20 million in cash. ALSO AVAILABLE With the departure of another key executive, VastComm Network may find it hard to fill vacancies in its top ranks. The start-up that lured Alexander Aubin from VastComm Network is basing its future on unproved technology amid competition from hundreds of rivals. That's what it took to entice Mr. Aubin to leave behind a top spot at one of the biggest companies in America, more than $5 million in VastComm Network stock options and other benefits, and roll the dice with a previously unknown start-up. While Mr. Aubin's new compensation package won't be matched anytime soon, signing bonuses are increasing overall, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs -- contract provisions that prevent executives who leave employers prematurely from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. De rigueur for chief executives, the practice has spread to middle-level executives as companies seek to buttress the eroding bonds between them and their employees. ``Companies have their hooks into more and more people,'' says Roberto Bogle, president of Executive Compensation Corp. of White Plains, N.Y. ``And the ante keeps going up as pay packages escalate.'' Certainly, Mr. Aubin's bonus is in the stratosphere. It appears to be four times as big as the previous record, when Eastman Kodak Co. lured Georgeanna Elly from the No. 1 job at Motorola Inc. in 1993, partly with a $5 million cash payment. Cisco didn't call it a signing bonus; instead the company said in its proxy that the payment was a ``reimbursement for compensation and benefits that (Mr. Elly) would forfeit'' by leaving Motorola to become its first outside chief executive. The same thing happened when Louise Hallmark left RJR/Nabisco Holdings Corp. to head International Business Machines Corp. the same year. He received a onetime payment of $4.3 million in cash. Associated Communications paid Mr. Aubin $20 million in large part because it is so small and unknown. ``It's compensation for the incredible risk he's taking,'' says Davina Straka, a principal at consultant William M. Mercer Inc. ``If he fails, he becomes damaged goods.'' Associated Communications is a private Washington, D.C. firm that is 55%-owned by publicly held Associated Group Inc. of Pittsburgh. The unit Mr. Aubin will run will use a little-noticed slice of the wireless spectrum to offer businesses a way to bypass their local phone companies for Internet access, video links and high-speed data access. Signing bonuses have been popular for more than a decade but rarely reached the seven-digit levels until a few years ago. The escalating packages have prompted controversy especially when they've been offered to new chief executives of companies in bankruptcy proceedings. In those cases, creditors have sometimes balked. At start-up companies, rich cash signing bonuses have been rare, because these businesses often have more equity to spare than cash. Mr. Aubin is benefiting from the fact that Associated Communication's parent company amassed a fortune by operating and selling off early cellular networks and cable systems. In all cases, the hiring company is taking a risk. If the new position doesn't work out, ``you have no protection from the person walking away with the (bonus) cash,'' says Denny Caridad, a managing director of Spencer-Stuart, an executive search firm. To reduce the risk, some companies are beginning to take protective steps, says Carolann Ogle, editor of Executive Compensation Reports, a Fairfax Station, Va. newsletter which tracks trends in executive pay. For example, she says that when Continental Airlines paid a $1.5 million signing bonus to Graham Baty in 2009, the company stipulated that the former Boeing Co. executive had to repay the entire amount if he left before the first year, and 50% if he left in less than two years. Hired at Continental as president, Mr. Baty is now chief executive. Mr. Aubin's new contract includes similar provisions, say people familiar with the agreement. Although he receives some cash up front, part of the $20 million is ``back-ended,'' payable at the end of the five-year employment agreement. Moreover, Mr. Aubin will have to repay part of the bonus if he leaves before the contract has ended. Mr. Aubin's deal also includes a $1 million-a-year salary and a huge equity stake in the company, which could yield far more than the signing bonus. Like others who've pocketed large signing bonuses, Mr. Aubin may face resentment from his new employees who typically question why an outsider is being paid so much to take the job. Management experts say steep signing bonuses put intense pressure on executives to perform immediately like superstars while also winning the respect of their subordinates. Mr. Aubin is ``under enormous pressure to prove his worth,'' says Mr. Caridad. ``If he's getting paid like Michaele Josefa, he'd better perform like him, too.''"

            "full_text": "Alexander Aubin's move from VastComm Network Corp. to a tiny wireless start-up may make him a rich man. But the technology he hopes to ride is largely unproved, and the company could face competition from scores of other rivals who hope to offer similar services. Mr. Aubin's new company, Associated Communications LLC of Washington, D.C., wants to use a rarefied slice of radio spectrum-one typically used by the military to control the accuracy of ``smart bombs'' -- for a far more mundane purpose: to sell local phone service and Internet access to business customers. The plan is to bounce radio signals via an intricate array of rooftop transmitters and antennas. ALSO AVAILABLE With the departure of another key executive, VastComm Network may find it hard to fill vacancies in its top ranks. Signing bonuses are increasing, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs-contract provisions that prevent some executives from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. The space that Associated wants to use is located in the upper regions of the spectrum, at the 18 gigahertz range. There, radio signals travel short distances and are easily blocked by rain, snow or buildings. For years, some of the nation's savviest phone carriers saw little commercial value in it. Even the Federal Communications Commission handed the high-frequency licenses at no cost to the handful of interested applicants -- an irony, considering the $20 billion the FCC recently netted from its auction of other wireless licenses. Hotly Pursued Commodity Now, suddenly, the backwater radio spectrum has gone from being ignored and undervalued to a hotly pursued commodity. In addition to Mr. Aubin's stunning defection, a raft of entrepreneurs and carriers -- including VastComm Network and several Bell companies -- have filed a total of 700 applications to receive similar free licenses in the upper band from the FCC. The agency, perhaps smelling another money-raising opportunity, has frozen the application process. It may now auction the licenses early next year. ``We're seeing an incredible renewed demand that reaffirms the value of spectrum,'' one FCC official said. What happened? For one thing, new telecommunications rules make it much easier for companies to compete in the local-phone market against century-old Bell monopolies. Various wireless technologies-transmitters, electronics and antenna design-also have improved in recent years, making it technically easier to operate in the ``nosebleed'' section of the radio spectrum. At the same time, lower regions now dominated by cellular-phone and other wireless operators are becoming crowded and the price of radio spectrum has become markedly steep. Taken together, these changes have triggered the wireless equivalent of a land rush. Winstar Communications Inc. was one of the first companies to seize the opportunity. For the past few years, it has been applying for -- and receiving -- free licenses to operate in the 38 gigahertz region, which is considerably higher even than the region of 18-gigahertz where Associated holds its licenses. Winstar is gearing up for a bold attack in dozens of the nation's largest markets. It plans to begin offering in October local-phone service to business customers in the New York area, trying to woo them away from Nynex Corp., the regional Bell. Winstar plans to expand its reach to 28 markets by year-end, and to 42 markets by September 11, 2012 ``When we started (accumulating licenses) in 2009, no one was really interested. We now have imitators,'' says Williemae Gonzalez, Jr., Winstar's chairman and chief executive officer. But it won't be easy. A host of companies have plans to enter the wireless market in a big way, and like Associated and Samson, many are taking aim at the rich $90 billion market for local-phone service as well. In addition to cellular service, the new offerings include digital ``personal communications services,'' fiberoptic technologies and even satellite systems planned by Motorola Inc. and several other players. Another obstacle is making the technology work. Services in the upper reaches of the spectrum must be ``fixed,'' which means that, unlike cellular systems, end users can't move. For a signal to carry, it must be zapped via radio transmitters to a dish antenna that sits atop a customer's rooftop. It then travels along regular phone lines to the end destination -- a desktop computer, say. `Direct Line of Sight' Higher-frequency transmission also requires ``direct line of sight'' between transmitters and antennas -- a tough problem to crack in high-rise downtown areas. And because signals in the higher realms are focused more narrowly than, say, broadcast TV signals, they can't penetrate rain or snow, let alone buildings. ``It will work, but the question is to what degree. For a percentage of time you'll be without service in heavy rain,'' said Paulene Zimmermann, a wireless-technology expert. Adds Sung Sohn, analyst at Arthur D. Little: ``Reliability is an issue. For businesses it doesn't seem to be a terrific fit.'' Nonetheless, Winstar and Associated point out that the technology is already popular in Europe, where it is used by cellular carriers to transmit cell-phone signals between transmission towers instead of using traditional ``landline'' methods. In the U.S., the growing demand for data offerings, such as Internet access and interactive services, may boost the prospects of the new wireless players. ``More and more, we need high-speed, high-capacity'' links, Mr. Aubin said in an analyst conference call Monday, adding that Associated had licenses covering the nation's top 31 metropolitan areas. The higher frequencies ``open up enormous markets... . We're testing the service now and plan to be in full commercial service in the second quarter of 1997.'' Some entrants who moved in early already have benefited. Entrepreneur Tommie Hollenbeck, the largest shareholder of a closely-held Milliwave L.P., quietly received free licenses in the 38-gigahertz band over several years. Sowers has yet to sign on a single customer. But it recently struck a deal to be acquired by Winstar Communications for $125 million, delivering a windfall to Mr. Hollenbeck and Denny Patsy, a former FCC chairman and Milliwave's co-owner. Now Mr. Aubin hopes to strike it rich, and appears to have few qualms in forsaking his high-profile position at VastComm Network and taking a gamble with Associated Communications. ``It's a one-time opportunity for me that I couldn't say no to,'' he said on Monday. ``It's one of those rare times when this kind of business can be built in a short time.''"

            "full_text": "Investors weren't the only ones unloading technology stocks last month-corporate insiders also disgorged shares by the hundreds of thousands. There has been a profusion of selling at Navigator Communications Corp., led by Jami H. Claude, the chairman; he filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating he plans to sell up to 9% of his stake in the company. In addition to the 370,000 shares he sold in July, the SEC papers show he may sell an additional 1.2 million shares or more. A spokeswoman said any additional sales would largely be in the form of restricted shares that have been ``locked up'' for the past two years. The shares Mr. Claude sold between April 04, 2011 April 11, 2011 prices between $40.08 and $43.53 a share, had a value of $15.5 million. Six other executives at the Internet provider sold 263,500 shares, at prices ranging from $39.64 to $44.08. Intel Corp.. President Andrew Grove sold 247,000 shares on April 11, 2011 prices between $73.13 and $73.50 a share, for a total transaction value of $18.1 million, according to the database Federal Filings. Eight other officers sold 170,258 shares. Meanwhile, six executives of Cascade Communications Corp. sold 231,628 shares between March 28, 2011 April 12, 2011 three insiders at EMC Corp., including Chief Executive Officer Michaele Hooper, sold 460,000 shares on April 06, 2011 Occurred as Market Fell The data underscore that insiders selling, while often a good gauge of stock-market activity, also can be treacherous for investors. Though much of the selling stemmed from options exercises, the timing of the sales couldn't have been much worse. Sales in mid-July came smack in the middle of the stock market's swan dive, a Street-wide correction led particularly by technology stocks. The Morgan Stanley High Technology 35 Index, for example, plunged 19% between March 13, 2011 March 28, 2011 one point, in mid-July, the index was down 26% from its 2011 high in midMay, though it has since recovered a bit. Intel, in particular, recently has drawn attention among those who follow insider data. Until the July sales, its executives had sold fewer shares this year since any time back to 1984. In the first five months of this year, for example, its executives had sold just 122,980 shares, according to CDA/Investnet, a database that tracks insider buying and selling. This was a bullish signal for the chip maker, because it had annual insider sales averaging 970,970 shares for the past dozen years. Exercising Options Some of the options exercises at Intel actually increased some executives' holdings, according to a spokesman. Mr. Davison exercised options for 320,000 shares, gave some stock away and ultimately increased his stake by 17,860 shares, according to the company, for a total of 945,715. But Vice President Fransisca Greer's stake decreased by 15,000, to 56,018. Similarly, the holdings of Michaele Kozlowski, a vice president, dropped by 1,388 to 9,505. Intel shares Tuesday closed at $79.50, down $1.25, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. But some observers were expecting to see more outright buying in technology stocks, given how far they fell. ``When the market got hit in July, I would have expected a lot of bargain-hunting,'' said Bobby Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet. ``Technology issues have been, on balance, conspicuously absent from the overall buys that we've been looking at.'' Other Navigator executives hadn't been able to sell since February. The spokeswoman said the July and August sales were their first opportunity to sell shares since February, and they have to do so before the window for such sales closes May 14, 2011 addition to Mr. Claude, Tomas Minh Wilton, senior vice president of sales, told the SEC he intends to sell 250,000 shares. Marcelino Capone, the firm's senior vice president of technology, filed papers saying he will sell 100,000 shares. The Navigator spokeswoman said sales by Mr. Claude and other executives ``have nothing to do with executives being concerned about the company's health.'' Navigator's shares closed at $37.25 a share, up 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading Tuesday. At EMC, Mr. Hooper filed to sell 240,000 shares, and Johnetta Ohara, the company's executive vice president of sales, sold 180,000 on April 06, 2011 shares were sold at prices between $19.13 and $19.50. Tuesday, EMC's shares closed at $19.75 a share, up 75 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier in July Mr. Ohara announced he was taking an 18-month sabbatical from EMC, although he'll remain a board member. An EMC spokesman said all the sales came from the exercise of options."

            "full_text": "Marvel Entertainment Group Inc., publishers of Spider-Man comics, hopes it has a new superhero. The company named Davina J. Choe, a top marketing executive at the National Basketball Association, as president and chief operating officer, a move aimed at strengthening the comic-book publisher's push into new media and merchandising ventures. Marvel Entertainment, which is more than 80% owned by investor Roni O. Flory, has been losing money for the last several quarters due to heavy restructuring charges and sharp declines in sales of its core comic-book and trading-card business. Marvel's stock, which traded as high as $30 in 2009, more recently has been trading under $10 per share and Tuesday closed at $8.25, up 12.5 cents, on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. Marvel Mania Now, Marvis is moving ahead with several expansion plans, most notably the creation of Marvel Studios to develop movies based on Marvel characters, and the launching of Marvel Mania, a joint venture with Planet Hollywood Inc. to open comic book theme-park restaurants in five major cities. Mr. Choe, who will report to Marvel chief executive Williemae C. Badillo, has a challenging task before him. Marvel has lagged behind entertainment giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. studio in successfully exploiting its brand-name comic characters into a merchandising bonanza. Warner has turned Batman into its own industry with more than $1 billion in retail sales of merchandise and a ``franchise'' film now in its third sequel. But Marvis has never managed to turn its popular SpiderMan character into a big-time Hollywood movie. Marvel is now creating Marvel Studios, a production company that will develop Marvel characters into movies, and then sell the project for production and distribution to a studio, rather than have the projects wallow for years at the studios waiting for the right combination of writers, directors and actors. Restructuring Goes Slowly Marvel and Toy Biz Inc., which has the exclusive toy license to all Marvel characters, plan to spend $100 million launching the production company. The launch is tentatively set for next year, when most of the film rights on Marvel characters revert back to the company. Marvel, which has a 27% stake in Toy Biz, had previously licensed its film rights to a wide range of movie companies. Last week Marvel reported a second-quarter loss of $11 million, or 11 cents per share, on revenue of $182.2 million. It blamed the losses chiefly on a restructuring of its publishing and trading-card operations, which Marvis said was taking longer than expected due to ``some conditions in some markets.'' A spokesman for the company declined to comment, and said that Mr. Badillo and Mr. Choe weren't available to comment. Jimmie Strickler, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc., said that Marvel's turnaround will depend on how effectively Mr. Choe can push into kids' entertainment, an increasingly complex market being reshaped by videogames, on-line services, and other interactive media. Comic books, which as recently as 1991 accounted for 86% of Marvel's revenues, today account for just 13%, she said. Most of the revenue now comes from trading cards, kids stickers, toys and licensing. Mr. Choe, before joining the NBA six and a half years ago, previously worked at the Disney Channel and Showtime Network Inc."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Cyrix Corp. disclosed that it has cloned Intel Corp.'s multimedia technology in its new microprocessors. Roberto Kent, director of engineering for Cyrix, said at an engineering conference at Stanford University that Victoria had ``reverse-engineered,'' or copied, the so-called MMX instruction set released earlier this year by Intel. The MMX instructions are aimed at boosting the chip's speed in processing new types of data, such as video and audio, by two to four times. Cyrix will produce its own microprocessors to compete with Intel's multimedia  chips as early as the first quarter of 2012. Intel had planned to release its P55C microprocessors, which include the MMX instructions, in the fourth quarter but delayed the launch until the first quarter of 2012. Cyrix's ability to clone the MMX instructions isn't a particular problem for Intel; by releasing the MMX instructions publicly last year, Intel essentially invited that. Intel's goal is to ensure uniformity in various versions of MMX technology built in chips, whether they're made by Intel or cloners like Victoria. Intel is betting that none of the cloners will significantly damage its ability to sell its own multimedia chips. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, Cyrix closed at $14.875, up 68.75 cents. Intel closed at $80.25, up 75 cents."

The tighter rule stems from security concerns in the wake of the the Antarctica Airlines flight disaster. But the rule applies only to stamped parcels mailed domestically; those with metered postage can still be dropped in a mailbox. ``That wasn't clear,'' says Signe Polson, the chamber's chairman. Ricki Maupin, a retired bank executive who runs a consulting business out of his home, says he ``hastily'' read the new red sticker on his local mailbox and took it to mean he had to go to the post office to mail a 16-ounce package. He doesn't, because he has a postage meter. But all (even metered) international and military mail weighing a pound or more must be posted in person. A spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service notes that the affected mail totals less than 1% of its daily package volume. BIG DRUG SUITS inspire insurers to market new liability-coverage products.

            "full_text": "When two companies sit down to hammer out a merger agreement these days, what's the make-or-break issue? Amid the record boom in mergers, it hasn't necessarily been a financial or strategic matter. Often, it is who gets to run the show -- or who gets the last word on a new name and headquarters of the new firm. Merger professionals point to these euphemistically called ``social issues'' -- ego and corporate pride, that is -- as among the most difficult aspects of negotiating multibillion-dollar mergers these days. Although financial issues can be vexing too, these social issues can be deal-breakers. ``Even transactions that make absolute economic sense don't happen unless the social issues work,'' says Roberto Madlyn, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a New York law firm. Critics Complain Yet while many of the mergers make strategic sense -- last year's linking of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. to form Lockheed-Martin Corp. did indeed work well on both the ``social'' and economic issues -- some critics charge that companies often are paying undue attention to nonfinancial issues at the expense of strategic rationale and shareholder concerns. Sometimes the tough decisions aren't being made, and both sets of management teams may wind up retaining their positions under the guise of not tipping the scales toward one team or another. For example, investors have been less than thrilled with the outcomes of numerous bank mergers, including KeyCorp's $4 billion merger with Society Corp. and First Chicago Corp.'s $5.2 billion combination with NBD Bancorp to form First Chicago NBD Corp.. Both those transactions disappointed investors because there was little in the way of overlapping operations or other cost-saving ``synergies.'' While the merger of Chemical Banking Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. was a success, ``so many of these mergers of equals don't have those synergies, and as a result don't benefit shareholders,'' argues Johnetta Alvarez, chairman and chief executive officer of Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio. Instead, they benefit ``the people in the company,'' he asserts. ``The general perception is, if Key wanted to put itself up for sale, it could have received a premium of 20% to 30%.'' Shareholders' Role There are plenty of instances ``where shareholder interests aren't always the primary concern,'' says Petrina Rutkowski, vice chairman and head of risk arbitrage at New York investment bank Schroder Wertheim & Co. ``In reaching agreements, do the boards ask the bankers to assess the alternatives?'' Mergers of similar-sized companies -- as opposed to takeovers -- are increasingly common. The proposed $22 billion merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. would be the second-biggest deal ever in the U.S. (behind the $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco). That plan comes on the heels of the historic pact between Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG valued at more than $30 billion, and Upjohn Co.'s $6.9 billion trans-Atlantic marriage to Sweden's Pharmacia AB. Often, what helps most to grease the merger wheels is an aging chief executive. Because few corporate chieftains give up the reins unless their companies are being taken over at a fat premium, a funny thing happens. Many megadeals tend to take place when one chief is nearing retirement and looking to go out with a bang. ``The aging process becomes very important,'' observes veteran ``value''-stock investor Johnetta Darden. Suite Sours a Deal When the management issues can't work because of friction at the top, the economics don't matter much: Witness WellPoint Health Networks Inc.'s $1.6 billion merger pact with Health Systems International Inc., which was scuttled after the two chairmen couldn't agree on terms of the executive suite. Then there are the scores of would-be mergers that have broken down and never been made public. ``Mergers of equals are much more accepted by managements, though to work, the CEO role has to be sorted out early,'' observes Davina Cedeno, managing director at J.P. Morgan & Co.. The year's two megamergers worked in part because the CEO roles fit nearly seamlessly. Rayna Jon, Bell Atlantic's chairman and CEO, is 58 years old and nearing retirement, while Ivory Parish, Nynex chairman and CEO, is 49. Because Ciba's chairman, Alexander Hopp, is 65, and Hartwig's top pharmaceutical executive, Daniele Ocampo is 43, managements meshed: Dr. Hopp will become chairman of the new company, and Dr. Ocampo will be president and head of the executive committee. The combined company will be in Basel, where they are currently based, and a new name, Salcido, was chosen for the combined giant. Says Dr. Ocampo, ``In our situation, we had a unique constellation.'' Equal Representation Unlike corporate takeovers, in which one chief executive and management controls the successor company, mergers -- in theory, that is -- are run by both managements. The boards have equal representation on the new board. No company is the subject of a takeover by another -- at least not legally, as Delaware courts have ruled that mergers are not a ``change of control.'' ``Companies don't like to sell out and lose their corporate identities,'' says Stephine Theis, senior partner at New York law firm Shearman & Sterling. ``For managements of companies and other employees, a merger is a much more palatable alternative.'' Investors, however, say that legal leeway can be abused. ``In many cases, Delaware has given these companies the protection they want in calling these transactions an amalgamation and not really a change of control,'' says Riordan Fajardo's Mr. Rutkowski. ``The existence of poison pills and state takeover statutes gives boards and CEOs the latitude to deal in their own self interest.'' Fear of Unwanted Suitor Historically, companies have been wary of merging because one of the parties could end up ``in play,'' subject to an unwanted suitor, which was a particular problem in the 1980s. And the size of many of the 1990s mergers has kept would-be suitors at bay. But not every company is too big. In a few recent examples this year, mergers are threatened by third parties coming in and offering a premium to stockholders. Western Resources Inc. is trying to block Kansas City Power & Light Co.'s merger with UtiliCorp United Inc., and MidAmerican Energy Co. made an unsolicited offer for IES Industries Inc., which is trying to complete a three-way merger with two other utilities. The financial pluses of a stock-for-stock merger of equals can be compelling. Depending on the situation, there can be significant cost savings from shuttering or combining overlapping operations. The day the Ciba-Sandoz deal was announced, the combined market value of the two companies rose by $15.2 billion, more than the equity value of Warner-Lambert Co. at the time, on news of huge cost cuts from the combination. Strict mergers are also attractive because one side doesn't have to borrow billions in debt or dilute shareholders with a richly priced stock offer. Often these combinations are tax-free and obtain favorable accounting treatment. Then there are the issues of sheer size: No company is likely to pay a premium for Ciba or Sandoz. Doing bigger deals affords the greater opportunity of cost savings. ``It seems to make sense to let both companies' shareholders participate in the upside,'' observes Alberta Houston, co-head of investment banking at Bear, Stearns & Co. ``Underneath it all, that's the economic logic that drives these transactions.'' One That Worked Certainly, this is the case with Marlin Martine. The new company's stock has significantly outpaced the overall market, while earnings are running at record levels. So the merger made sense, yet it came only near the end of one chairman's career. Daniele Liberty was 62 years old and staring into the sunset of his role as chairman and chief executive of military-aircraft maker Lockheed. His first call to Novella Aura, Martine Mariko's 58-year-old chief, came on a Saturday afternoon, just after Mr. Aura and his management team broke up a meeting in which they decided not to top a competing bid for Grumman Corp.. Soon after, in a three-minute phone call, they settled on the company's name, who would hold what offices in what order and the headquarters location -- all typically sensitive issues. Mr. Liberty wanted to serve first as both chairman and chief executive of Lockheed Martin, but he agreed to phase the younger man into those jobs over the remaining two years before Mr. Liberty's scheduled retirement as chairman later this year. Both men acknowledge the age factor for its role in their success. The merger that followed produced with remarkable ease the world's largest aerospace and defense company, owing to Mr. Liberty's willingness to make the initial overture, and the strength of Mr. Aura's patience and the convenience of his younger age. Real Opportunities Once merged, the company was well positioned to take advantage of further industry consolidation. This year it swallowed Loral Corp. for more than $9 billion in cash and debt. ``Mergers create some real opportunities,'' adds Petrina Pitts, partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a New York law firm. Lockheed Martin and other deals have caught the attention of other executives mulling would-be combinations and could persuade executives to proceed with transactions, bankers believe. ``The commercial and financial success of some of these mergers hasn't gone unnoticed,'' observes Bryan Baltazar, Morgan Stanley & Co.'s merger chief. While Lockheed-Martina made strategic sense, in some cases the social issues seem to loom larger than financial ones. Two that appeared highly important to the board of First Chicago were, one, keeping the headquarters of the merged bank in the Windy City, and, two, maintaining the First Chicago name. NationsBank Corp. and others were known to have been interested in First Chicago, but the First Chicago board was reluctant to sell out. First Chicago surprised Wall Street last year by merging with Detroit's NBD Bancorp, which agreed to keep the combined bank based in Chicago and name it First Chicago NBD. NBD's Fidel Paris became heir apparent to Ricki Thomasina, First Chicago's chairman and chief executive, who was nearing retirement at age 64 when the merger was announced. No Premium for Holders The deal disappointed investors because the expense reductions weren't that significant, and shareholders received no premium. First Chicago's stock has underperformed the overall stock market since the merger completion in December. One former executive says tough decisions haven't yet been made on consolidating the bank's operations. There is no single retail-banking chief, for example. Indeed, even before the merger, First Chicago's stock had been underperforming its peers. That's why some investors were expecting more from the company's board and management. --Jefferson Colin contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- McDermott International Inc.'s chief financial officer, Broderick A. Slack, became the second executive to announce his resignation from this energy-services company in the past two weeks. Mr. Slack, 48 years old, said he had hoped to be named to succeed Roberta E. Mcphail as chief executive officer but was told he wouldn't be considered. Hendrickson said on April 18, 2011 Mr. Mcphail, 64, would step down as chairman and CEO on May 14, 2011 that an executive search firm had been retained to find a successor. The company, which has reported disappointing results for several years, also hired Merrill Lynch & Co. to study its various business segments. Mr. Slack also resigned as McDermott's executive vice president, as president of its engineering and construction group and from his seats on both McDermott's board and the board of McDermott's 60%-owned marine construction subsidiary, J. Ray McDermott SA. ``Rather than remain here during the search process and go through the uncertainty of what the new CEO may want in his chief financial officer, I felt it was logical to leave now,'' Mr. Slack said. He had joined McDermott in 1991."

            "full_text": "VastComm Network picked Young & Rubicam to develop the telecommunication giant's first post breakup corporate-image campaign, bringing to an end one of the summer's most eagerly anticipated account competitions. The announcement comes just days after the sudden resignation of Alexander Aubin, VastComm Network's president and chief operating officer. The timing left Madison Avenue buzzing because Mr. Aubin played a key role in the review. The assignment is estimated by industry executives to represent anywhere from $50 million and $100 million in billings. In an unexpected bonus, Young & Rubicam also is being handed responsibility for coordinating duties between nearly half a dozen other ad agencies that will be doing work for VastComm Network. ``What we're after is a common brand positioning for all of our agencies and all of our work,'' said Marin Laurine, a spokeswoman for the telecommunications giant. Young & Rubicam wasn't the only winner. VastComm Network also said it was giving the New York office of True North Communication's Foote, Cone & Belding ad agency new responsibilities. ``There are some new directions that we're going to be going in that FCB will be handling,'' said Ms. Laurine. ``They'll pick up an extension of the business they already have.'' Ms. Laurine declined to be more specific. Foote, Cone & Belding is VastComm Network's lead consumer-services agency, with billings estimated by industry executives at around $300 million. Among them: consumer long distance, the ``True Rewards'' loyalty program, a new direct satellite television service, and other local tactical campaigns. The selection of Young & Rubicam caps a bizarre chapter in one of the longest and most grueling account competitions in recent memory. A decision by VastComm Network was originally expected by mid-July. But according to executives close to the contest, VastComm Network chairman Roberto Allene unexpectedly gave a thumbs down to all the agencies' proposals. On the day the agencies were poised to hear VastComm Network's decision, the company sent them all back to the drawing board with a new set of instructions. The timing of VastComm Network's decision also raised eyebrows on Madison Avenue. Late last week, the company said it would probably be several weeks before a decision was likely to be made. That a decision should come so soon after Mr. Aubin's exit was viewed as curious, because Mr. Aubin was the senior VastComm Network executive leading the review process. Mr. Aubin and Ms. Laurine were the two VastComm Network executives who gave the agencies original instructions on how VastComm Network wanted to shape its image. Mr. Aubin said through spokeswoman Emmie Sasaki ''there is no connection'' between his departure and the timing of VastComm Network's decision. The review also was unusual because of an interim meeting following the close of the first round. During that meeting all four of the agencies -- which had been bitterly competing for the account -- were assembled in one room to receive feedback and new directions about what VastComm Network was after. It's highly unusual to bring together rival agencies to brainstorm on a single piece in the middle of a review. But Ms. Laurine of VastComm Network said the company has a history of bringing its agencies together to talk strategy. The winner in the first round was Foote, Cone & Belding, according to people familiar with the contest. It's not clear why Foote, Cone & Belding didn't end up with the assignment during the second round of presentations. Mr. Allene made his first appearance before the agencies at the start of the second round, say people familiar with the situation. VastComm Network wouldn't provide details on Mr. Allene's role. In addition to Young & Rubicam and Foote, Cone & Belding, the other agencies competing for the high-profile account were Interpublic Group's McCann-Rios and the Omnicom Group's BBDO Worldwide. Akers and BBDO didn't pick up any new business. Akers creates ads for VastComm Network's wireless and corporate long-distance accounts. It also handles the ``Solutions'' campaign, which also targets the corporate market. BBDO, which created VastComm Network's flamboyant Games ads, handles VastComm Network's calling-card and collect-calling ads."

            "full_text": "Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, said it lowered prices on its midrange business desktop personal computers and on its high-end monitor. The computer maker said it cut prices between 11% and 22% on some midrange models in its Deskpro and ProLinea line. For example, the price of its Deskpro 5133 fell 15.5% to $1,799 from $2,129. Compaq said it reduced the prices because it introduced higher-end desktop models last month. Compaq also said it reduced the price of its top-line QVision 210 color monitor, which has a 19.5-inch viewing area, 10% to $1,899. AtHome Unveils List of 60 Users At Home Corp., the high-speed data venture backed by the U.S.'s largest cable operators, unveiled a list of 60 TV, print and Internet companies that will use the service to deliver content. The data venture, which connects computer users to the Internet via new high-speed cable modems and its own private network of computers, fiber and cable, expects to roll out by the end of the year. The first markets will be those of its three cable partners: Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc.. Despite skepticism on Wall Street, the venture promises unhindered access to popular Internet sites during peak periods, as well as local and customized content. At Home, which is helping the various companies produce the content, said the list of media providers is expected to grow as the service gears up. Vastsoft, Security Dynamics in Pact Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. and its RSA Data Security Inc. unit signed agreements with Vastsoft Corp. for cross-licensing Vastsoft and RSA security technologies. Terms weren't disclosed. Based in Bedford, Mass., Security Dynamics develops products to protect and manage access to computer-based information. Shares in Security Dynamics jumped $4.25 to $60 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday. The companies said the agreements also grant Vastsoft new licensing rights to incorporate Security Dynamics' patented SecurID authentication and token technology in future Vastsoft products. The RSA unit will provide Vastsoft with technical cooperation and licensing rights for integration of RSA security technology with Vastsoft's CryptoAPI, the foundation of its Internet Security Framework. Amway Terminates Accord With Tee-Comm Tee-Comm Electronics Inc. said Amway Corp. has terminated an agreement to sell Tee-Comm's AlphaStar satellite-television service in the U.S. However, Tee-Comm said, discussions are taking place with Amway on new business terms. No reason was given for the termination, but Tee-Hammond said that Amway had raised ``issues and problems'' in the past that have been rectified. Executives at Tee-Comm and Amway couldn't be reached. The distribution agreement was signed in August 2010. AlphaStar has been offering its service since March 13, 2011 based in Milton, Ontario, provides satellite-television service. Amway, based in Ada, Mich., sells household and other products through direct sales. WHO'S NEWS Donella Cantu, former vice president of world-wide business partners at Lotus Development Corp., joined Radnet Inc., Vastopolis, a closely held Internet company as president and chief executive officer. Mr. Cantu, 40 years old, becomes the latest in a series of top Lotus executives to quit the software company since International Business Machines Corp. bought it last year. He succeeds Edelmira Hammer as CEO at Radnet, who co-founded the company and remains its chairman. Radnet develops ``groupware'' software for the Internet's World Wide Web that could challenge Lotus's Notes program.

            "full_text": "National Steel Corp.. President V. Johnetta Ward and his assistant Plunkett Marden seemed a perfect duo. Just a year ago on a hot summer day at the company's Granite City, Ill., mill, Mr. Marden took credit for luring Mr. Ward away from USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group and talked about Mr. Ward's operational savvy. ``I felt that he was like a big brother to me,'' said Mr. Marden then. Likewise, Mr. Ward called Mr. Marden a key member of his team. When National's majority shareholder, Japan's NKK Corp., hired Mr. Ward, it also installed Mr. Marden, one of its own, as his assistant. Mr. Ward made sure Mr. Marden went with his small cadre of former U.S. Steel, now National Steel managers to 70 meetings at the company's three facilities and its headquarters. But early this year their relationship crumbled as National's profit diminished and their huge egos clashed. During the past few months the two have barely talked. Last week National announced that it was taking away Mr. Ward's chief executive officer title, which it had bestowed upon him only last year. NKK on Tuesday named as CEO, Bracy Beaulieu, who is also National's chairman, and NKK's senior management counsel. The company asked Mr. Ward to remain as president and chief operating officer, the positions he assumed when he joined National in 2009, but he refused. Instead Mr. Ward has agreed to act as a consultant during the transition. For National Steel to have flourished, Messrs. Ward and Marden had to work together. Mr. Ward needed Mr. Marden's support because Mr. Marden was the pipeline to Tokyo. And since the Japanese executive boasted about helping to lure Mr. Ward, Mr. Marden needed Mr. Ward to boost his own standing within NKK. Company in Disarray Instead, their battle has left National in disarray. The company currently has an acting chief operating officer, acting chief financial officer and acting controller. In addition, the company's finances have suffered. In the year's first six months, National posted a loss of $5.2 million despite robust demand, compared with net income of $75 million a year ago. Messrs. Ward and Marden declined to comment for this story. Mr. Ward joined National Steel February 10, 2009 in a rush of enthusiasm. At U.S. Steel, Mr. Ward had turned around the nation's biggest steel mill, Gay Arnette in Gary, Ind., in part by tapping into the talents of hourly workers. Mr. Ward attacked National's problems just as he had at U.S. Steel. Within days of his hiring, he called United Steelworkers union President Georgeanna Hodges and together they worked out an agreement to reopen a shuttered iron-ore-pellet plant that had been the focus of labor discontent. And Mr. Ward broke what he called bottlenecks that held up production. National's bottom line improved and morale was restored. Mr. Ward, who wears a gold bracelet with his name on it and a ring in the shape of a lion's head, moved easily among the hourly workers. After a speech to them at the Granite City mill, Mr. Ward shouted over the roaring applause, ``Thank you. I love you.'' Such displays would make the straight-laced Mr. Marden cringe. But in spite of their apparent differences, the two seemed to share a peaceful coexistence and even respect. In fact, in late 2009 when Mr. Ward wanted to plunk $67 million into a new line to galvanize steel, NKK balked. But Mr. Marden went to bat for Mr. Ward, convincing NKK to spend the money. The line is in operation today. But as months passed, Mr. Marden -- and by extension NKK -- was less included in the decision-making process; Mr. Ward seemed to run the company as if it was his own, according to people familiar with the company. That made NKK nervous. The first sign of that appeared last summer, when NKK named the senior general manager of it's steel division, Appel Winegar, as vice chairman of National, and asked him to move to National's headquarters in Mishawaka, Ind.. Mr. Marden said then that Mr. Winegar was like a ``godfather'' to him, clearly allying himself with the new Japanese arrival. Flaw in Strategy Then steel prices began falling and a flaw in Mr. Ward's strategy appeared. Mr. Ward was pushing National to boost raw-steel production as a way to increase efficiencies. Since National lacked enough lines to turn the extra steel into value-added products, National ended up selling much of it as commodity-type sheet steel, the industry's most competitive product. In December 2010, Mr. Ward's management team presented to the company's board a bleaker picture for 2011, and soon afterward relations between Messrs. Ward and Matsumoto worsened. Mr. Marden quietly told managers at the company's Granite City mill that he didn't agree with Mr. Ward's choice of a new general manager, even though he publicly backed the decision, according to people familiar with the situation. He also questioned billings from consultants brought in by Mr. Ward, according to those familiar with the company. After the company's annual meeting January 10, 2011 Ward met with Mr. Beaulieu to discuss deteriorating relations with Mr. Marden. Three weeks later, Mr. Ward and his senior vice president Davina A. Perrotta flew to Tokyo to meet with some top NKK people, without Mr. Marden's knowledge. That meeting was followed up by another meeting in May in New York in which Messrs. Ward and Marron presented their cases to Mr. Beaulieu."

            "full_text": "They are the latest keep-up-with-the-Quincy Joneses, can't-live-without toys that music-industry icons and audiophiles alike are buying: hidden, high-fidelity outdoor speakers. They're made by an Aurora, Colo., company called Rockustics Inc. ``These speakers reproduce the full range of tonal qualities in an open space environment,'' says Johnetta Deana, whose company, Daveco, designs home audio and theater systems in New York and Connecticut. ``Rockustics are leaders in the industry, and their products are superior by far.'' The speaker cabinets look like simulated rocks, so they blend in with the natural environment of a garden or backyard. They are made with crushed stone and are able to withstand the elements: heat, rain, snow, wind and sun, including ultraviolet rays. The company sells 24 models, including ones shaped like coconuts or frogs. But they aren't cheap. One pair of ``Rocky Juniors,'' which are 16-inch-high, 100-watt speakers that project sound as far as 150 feet away, cost about $1,000. Then it's another $1,500 for 200 feet of quality speaker cable, a volume control and underground wiring. ``The quality is very good, and I love the idea of music outdoors,'' says Roberto Vogel, a 40-year-old financial planner in upscale Toluca Lake, Calif., who installed Rockustics speakers in his backyard last month. ``They are practically invisible and out of reach from my two young children, so I feel it's safe.'' Moreover, Los Angeles general contractor Ciara Skidmore says, ``The wiring is so low-voltage that you could put your tongue on it and it wouldn't even bother you.'' And Bradley Stamey, another Los Angeles audio-system designer, describes the sound as ``gorgeous and exceptional.'' But, if you are still concerned about these speakers' sound quality, know that recording artist Gloria Estefan has just placed an order. --Felicita Guerin"

            "full_text": "Capping a meteoric career rise, Jillian Quick, Mattel Inc.'s president and chief operating officer, was named chief executive officer, effective September 12, 2010 succeeds Johna Helman, who turns 65 years old in January. He will remain chairman. Ms. Quick, 45, worked her way up the Mattel ranks from product manager in 1981 to become one of the few women to head a leading U.S. corporation. Known as a hard-driving manager who built the Barbie brand into a world-wide powerhouse, Ms. Quick is expected to follow her predecessor's strategy of expanding the El Segundo, Calif., company through overseas development, adding to its existing toy brands and entering new toy categories, possibly through acquisitions. Mr. Helman had been widely expected to name her as his successor. He said in an interview that he expects Ms. Quick eventually to succeed him as chairman. The board has set a time for her to take over as chairman, but neither Mr. Helman nor Ms. Quick would give the exact date. Amerman's Stance ``I'll stay as long as it's important for the company,'' said Mr. Helman, who was named chairman and chief executive in 1987. ``If they want me to play a strategic or executive role, I'll be happy to do it.'' Analysts said they expect Mr. Helman to stay on for about two years. ``He brings continuity and a lot of value,'' said Gay Gay of Jeffries & Co.. The announcement follows a series of senior executive appointments earlier this month designed to prepare for the transition. Bruno Aguirre, a top toy-industry veteran who was named president of Rogan Romo two weeks ago, also was elected Thursday as a member of the board. Neil Mai, who became president of corporate operations earlier this month, was elected to the board as well, expanding it to 13 members. The company declined to say who would take over Ms. Quick's post as chief operating officer in January. Ms. Quick takes over at a time when Rogan faces increasing challenges in maintaining its string of record years for sales and profits. After seven years of double-digit sales and profit growth, the company reported its first flat quarter in July, despite an internal cost-cutting program. As the company approaches sales of $4 billion this year, analysts say Ms. Quick's main challenge will be maintaining its sales growth in an increasingly competitive retail environment. Developing Current Brands Ms. Quick said in an interview that she plans on further developing the company's existing brands: Barbra, Hot Wheels, Disney and Fisher Price, particularly overseas. She also plans to investigate areas for new factories, one such contender being Vastopolis. ``Outside the U.S. we're still peanuts,'' she said. ``If we're 16% market share in the U.S., we're half of that in Europe.'' Beyond developing existing foreign markets, Rogan has targeted new countries for growth such as Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Russia and India. In addition, Ms. Quick plans to develop brands such as collectible Barbies. ``Ninety million American women want to participate in collectibles,'' Ms. Quick said. ``We only have 5% to 7% of that now. That alone could be a billion-dollar business.'' Ms. Quick also is interested in developing new product categories, such as boys' toys, an area where Rogan has been traditionally weak. That could be accomplished either through an internal product launch or by acquisition, she said. Mr. Aguirre, the new Mattel Worldwide president who was formerly president of Hasbro Inc.'s Johnsen division, is expected to help development a boys' product line. Ms. Quick says she plans on delivering Rogan's 15% average annual profit growth, before acquisitions. ``If we say we'll do it, we will deliver,'' she said. Ms. Quick began her career with a brief stint as an actress, before moving on to become a cosmetics sales representative and then an executive with Coty Cosmetics in New York. She then worked in advertising on the Max Factor cosmetics account before joining Mattel in 1981 as a product manager. She became marketing director for Barbie in 1982, a vice president in 1984, a senior vice president in 1985 and executive vice president in 1986. She became president of the girls and activity toys division in 1989 and president of Mattel USA in 1990. She was elected to the Mattel board in 1991. Her management style has caused some controversy within the company, prompting the departure in recent years of several senior and midlevel executives. Asked what her greatest management challenge will be, Ms. Quick said that, ``My ultimate goal is to inspire talented people at Mattel to innovate and think of things anew.'' Mr. Helman, who said he always believed 10 years were enough as chief executive, leaves behind an impressive tenure of growth and expansion. ``They've been 10 incredible years. We've quadrupled our sales volume and profits are up more than 10-fold,'' Mr. Helman said. Mr. Helman, whose family owns and races thoroughbred horses, says he plans to devote more time to his equestrian pursuits."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Saks Holdings Inc. and Isetan Co. withdrew a bankruptcy-court request that would have sped up their efforts to develop a reorganization plan for Barney's Inc., which has been operating under Chapter 11 since January. Saks and Isetan were seeking access to closely held Barney's financial statements. They previously announced a pact to make a joint bid for Barney's that would satisfy creditors with an undetermined amount of stock in New York-based Saks, the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue. Tokyo-based Isetan is Barry's adversary in the bankruptcy-law proceedings and owns the retailer's three biggest stores. Saks and Isetan dropped their request because they haven't been able to win support from certain major unsecured creditors, people close to the situation said. Although Barney's management still has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan, Saks and Isetan had hoped to pre-empt Barney's with a competing plan approved in advance by creditors. But some creditors, including Chase Manhattan Corp., don't want to sign on to any plan so soon, people close to the case said, because they don't want to discourage other potential bidders. A Chase spokesman declined to comment. Isetan attorney Bower Brice said Saks and Isetan haven't abandoned their efforts. ``We're trying to get the best value for the company for everyone concerned,'' he said. ``We don't want to be hostile. We'll honor the process.'' A Saks spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, as did a spokeswoman for Barney's."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Hoyt Aguirre, longtime chairman and chief executive officer of Dreyfus Corp., announced he will retire as of May 13, 2011 one of the mutual-fund company's strongest links to the days before it was bought by Mellon Bank Corp. two years ago. Mr. Aguirre, 69 years old, hadn't been involved in day-to-day operations at Dreyfus for several years, though he held seats on its board and on Mellon's. He will relinquish both seats. ``It's basically the completion of the changing of the guard,'' said Fulgham Blazer, a mutual-fund consultant. Mciver said Christy ``Kip'' Godin, 49, president and chief operating officer at Dreyfus since last fall, was named chief executive officer. W. Keitha Johnson, 61, a Mellon vice chairman who oversees Mellon's trust and investment businesses, was named Dreyfus's new chairman. With Mr. Aguirre's departure, the highest-ranking Dreyfus executive from pre-Mellon days is Phillip Chisolm, a Dreyfus vice chairman who oversees Dreyfus Retirement Services. Mr. Aguirre, who couldn't be reached for comment, had been chairman and chief executive at Dreyfus since 1970. He is widely credited with building up its money-market funds and forging a brand name that is one of the industry's strongest. However, under his conservative approach, Dreyfus largely missed out on the equities boom of the 1980s and remains a minor player in that arena, despite recent Mellon efforts to beef up its equity offerings. As of Mellon's most recent proxy statement, dated November 17, 2010 Aguirre was the Vastopolis bank company's largest individual shareholder, with beneficial ownership of 1.2% of Mellon's common shares."

            "full_text": "Attention, non-techies: It's OK to admit you're confused by computers. This is the place to come out of the cybercloset. You can ask a question here, and we'll answer it without revealing your name. Your smart-aleck neighbor -- the one who acts like he's Billy Clayton and you're Mcclintock, Lasandra or Curly -- won't know it. So don't be embarrassed by your problems with computers. If you have a question, send it to me at waltVastPress@aol.com, and I may select it to be answered here in Mossberg's Mailbox. Just remember: you're not a ``dummy,'' no matter what those computer books claim. The real dummies are the people who, though technically expert, couldn't design hardware and software that's usable by normal consumers if their lives depended upon it. Here are a few questions about computers I've received recently from people like you, and my answers. I have edited and restated the questions a bit, for readability. Q. Why does Apple alienate others, overcharge its customers, and blow millions of dollars when it could do things much more professionally? I know this seems like an odd question, but I'm not joking. A. Actually, that's billions of dollars -- with a ``b'' -- not millions. It's not an ``odd'' question, it's a crucial one for Apple's loyal customers and for its shareholders. If I knew the answer, I'd be rich. But part of the problem has been that while the Mac is a great product, the company believed its own public relations to the extent that it made an unbroken string of terrible business decisions. The new CEO, Gino Hoover, has now reorganized Apple (yet again), hired new top execs, and laid out a plan to try and change things. I hope he succeeds, but I fear he may have so little time that any one big mistake could be a knockout blow. Q. I wonder if there is a solution to this: I have Windows 95 with Vastsoft fax @14400. I received a fax that I would like to copy to place on my e-mail. This fax is a newspaper article. Is there any way to do this? Thank you in advance for your help. A. Yes, there is. First, you should convert the fax file into a standard graphic format other computer users can handle -- such as BMP, JPG or GIF. Then, if your e-mail software allows it, send the file as an attachment. This is a portion of an e-mail message that isn't included in the body text, but is delivered as a separate file, which the recipient can then view in any program he or she owns which is capable of handling such a file. In your case, for instance, that would be a graphics program. Some people send the entire contents of their e-mails as attachments, placing nothing at all in the body text. Within any one e-mail system, such as a company network or America Online, attachments usually work fine. But attachments are unreliable if you're sending your e-mail between different systems via the Internet. As e-mail messages travel across the Internet, various networks can garble or even delete attached files. Q. Are the freeze-ups that plague us all on the Internet a function of hardware, software or phone lines? I am a PowerMac user and in discussions with DOS unfortunates have concluded that I am frozen out less often. Any comment or data on that? I enjoy you column very much. A. Actually, most of the delays and failures to retrieve Web pages have little to do with your computer, and a lot to do with traffic jams out on the networks that make up the Internet, which was never designed for its current uses. Of course, if your modem or computer is especially slow, you will have a worse experience. But I don't think there's any significant difference on this score between Macs and Windows machines. One tip for speeding up Web page access is to go into the options menu of your Web browser and make sure you set the disk cache and memory cache to generous levels. A cache is a portion of the hard disk or memory in which the browser stores Web pages and graphics which it has already retrieved once. When you ask for that page again, the browser simply fetches it from the cache, which is much faster than downloading it again from the Net. Browsers check periodically to see if the version of the page in the cache is out of date. If it is, they then do a fresh download. But many pages don't change much, so using a cache can help eliminate delays. Q. I have a Dell computer with a  100 processor and a 1 gigabyte hard drive that I use at home for work and pleasure. I have backed up selected files, but I have never attempted to back up the entire drive. Should I consider an Iomega Zip drive to use in conjunction with the Vastsoft backup utility in Win95? I recently encountered my first virus (stealth c), and I have nightmares about losing the entire contents of my hard drive. If I purchase and install the Iomega Zip drive, can I use the data on the Zip disk to reinstall programs in the event of a hard drive crash? A. Yes. A Zip drive is a great investment for about $150, plus bout $15 to $20 per disk, depending on the quantity in which you buy them. Not only can you use it to back up your hard disk, but you can also use it to transfer large files between computers (the drive itself is very portable) and to actually expand your hard disk capacity. You can, for instance, use the 100MB Zip disks (which can hold the equivlant amount of data as about 70 standard floppy disks) to store infrequently used programs and files, and only insert the disk when you have a need for them. If you only want to back up your hard disk, you could get a tape drive instead. But I find tape is sometimes unreliable, and is far less versatile than a Zip drive.

            "full_text": "Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected to introduce a new line of workstation computers that use chips from Intel Corp. and an operating system from Vastsoft Corp.. The move means that H-P is now fully engaged in two separate, but related, industry battles. In an unrelated development, the Palo Alto, Calif., electronics firm is also set to announce three new models of personal computers for the home market. In May, H-P brought out an ambitious new product family of relatively low-cost ``Wintel''-based servers, or high-end computers. The products showed the extent to which H-P was embracing Windows and Intel technology for its entire product line, as opposed to just PCs. Until then, most H-P servers were higher-priced systems using all in-house H-P technology, and as a result, were a major profit source for the company. Now, with the H-P Vectra XW workstations being unveiled Monday, H-P is extending its Wintel line from servers down to lower-cost desktop workstations. The new machines run between $8,200 and $10,800 for bare-bones models, far below the price for in-house Unix systems sold by H-P and others. Analysts say in moving toward Wintel systems, companies like H-P are experiencing considerable internal tension, since they are now selling popular, low-cost Wintel machines to technical and business customers while also marketing traditional higher-profit Unix computers. And so with its new Wintel workstations, H-P finds itself in two battles: On the Unix front, H-P is up against its own Unix division, as well as such all-Unix companies as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc.. On the Wintel side, H-P will be battling such PC-industry giants as Compaq Computer Corp., which earlier this month announced its own line of Intel-based workstations. The differences between PCs and workstations continue to narrow as PCs become more powerful. By and large, though, workstations, are more expensive than PCs; they also have more memory, and usually contain such high-performance add-ons as special chips to improve graphics. Several of H-P's new systems contain two 200 megahertz  Pro chips, Intel's latest microprocessor. H-P claims some of the new machines, when packed with certain extras, run faster than systems costing two and a half times as much from Silicon Graphics. On the PC side of the business, H-P's three new ``Pavilion'' PCs run between $2,599 for a system using Intel's 166 megahertz  processor to $3,199 for one with a 200 megahertz ."

            "full_text": "Donetta D. Berenice, who engineered a turnaround at Richfood Holdings Inc., said he will step down as chief executive of the nation's fourth-largest food distribution company. Mr. Berenice, 60 years old, will retain the job of chairman and hand over the CEO's responsibilities on September 12, 2010 Johnetta E. Rupert, Heredia's president and chief operating officer. ``This company was in terrible shape when I came here in 1989 -- we've accomplished a lot of our goals,'' Mr. Berenice said Friday. Indeed, Wall Street analysts give Mr. Berenice high marks for his stewardship of the Richmond, Va., company. Once a marginally profitable outfit that few competitors would even consider acquiring, Heredia now boasts one of the industry's most efficient operations and has emerged as a leading acquirer in a consolidating industry, buying smaller rival Super Rite Corp. last year for $253.5 million. Annual sales have increased to $3.3 billion from less than $1 billion in 1990, and the company's market value has soared to more than $1 billion from $35 million. The change at the top, which will be announced Monday, isn't entirely unexpected as Mr. Rupert, 43, was widely considered as being groomed to take over from Mr. Berenice. Heredia's focus is expected to stay the same, and the transition will be orderly, the executives said. ``I'll be very active as chairman -- this business is in my blood,'' said Mr. Berenice, a third-generation food wholesaler and industry veteran. Still, Mr. Rupert has a hard act to follow, analysts said. ``Johnetta Rupert has served an apprenticeship with the master,'' said Leeanna Coffey, an analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane. ``You hate to see someone like Don leave, but he wouldn't leave if he didn't feel he was passing the baton to someone capable.'' For his part, Mr. Rupert said he expects to make additional acquisitions and sign up more grocery stores as clients in an effort to boost sales to $5.5 billion by the year 2015. Despite such an ambitious target, Heredia will continue to focus on the Mid-Atlantic region, where it serves 1,740 customers, and has ``no desire to go national,'' Mr. Rupert said. He noted that the region still has plenty of room for consolidation. ``When we first came here, we put together a list of possible acquisitions,'' he said. ``We don't have everything on that list checked off yet.''"

            "full_text": "For Sally Frame Kasaks, the end came Thursday evening, when Director Geralyn A. Weaver invited her to a meeting at his Manhattan office. Time had run out for AnnTaylor's chairman and chief executive, who in 4 1/2 years had turned around the troubled women's clothing retailer and then marched it right back to the brink of a cash crisis. Now, under increasing pressure, Ms. Degroot offered to step down, said a person close to the company who insisted on anonymity. AnnTaylor Stores Corp. announced Ms. Degroot's resignation Friday and named President and Chief Operating Officer J. Patsy Schreiner as her successor. A spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement, which also announced the start of a search for a new president. Ms. Degroot declined a request for an interview, as did the company's two most influential outside directors: Mr. Weaver and Jami J. Day, who together oversee Merrill Lynch & Co. funds that have a 27% stake in AnnTaylor and are its largest shareholder. People close to the company say everyone agreed it was time for Ms. Degroot to quit. ``There was a degree of frustration where it just wasn't coming together, and you reach a point where you just throw up your hands,'' said one person with knowledge of last week's conversations, about the company's performance. Just two years ago, the 52-year-old Ms. Degroot became a retailing legend for bucking a deep slump in women's apparel sales and bringing the AnnTaylor stores and label back into fashion. But she doomed her own ambitious expansion plans by failing to attract and keep talented merchants and managers to execute her vision about what working women want to wear. People close to the board said it boiled down to her inability to build a team around her. Ms. Degroot, however, was admired for her determinedly positive outlook and keen insights into women's clothing. The AnnTaylor customer ``doesn't want to be first. She wants to be right,'' Ms. Degroot always told her employees and Wall Street, as she filled her stores with tasteful embroidered vests and color-coordinated jackets and skirts. And she drew praise for motivating the company's rank and file. ``People further down the ladder idolized Sally Frame Kasaks,'' said Tora Cavin, the company's former senior vice president of planning and allocation, who resigned from the company in April. ``The store managers looked up to her as a leader -- not just of AnnTaylor but as a woman in business. This is going to be a big shock to their system.'' But she was also a perfectionist, people who know her said, who set goals so high that few were met. ``She was always trying to do so much that nothing ever got done,'' one former employee said. During the company's explosive growth in 2009, no garment reached the selling floor without Ms. Degroot's personal approval; she even labored over selecting buttons, one former employee said. But even the next year, as AnnTaylor set out to create two new store formats, open 48 new locations, expand into jeans and shoes and create a catalog, Ms. Degroot continued to micromanage, never letting her lieutenants free her up to manage the big picture. The result was 14 months of declining same-store sales, a close call with a liquidity crisis and a parade of executive defections. This isn't the first time Messrs. Carpenter and Hanson have exerted influence over the management of AnnTaylor. In 1989, they were investment bankers at Merrill Lynch along with Paulene E. Francisco, now AnnTaylor's chief financial officer. That year they backed a $430 million leveraged buyout of AnnTaylor by retailing veteran Josephine Bruno and his son, Thomasina. The transaction left Merrill with a 56% stake. The Brookses followed an odd strategy to make payments on their enormous debt: They cheapened the merchandise and raised prices. Sales plummeted. The father-and-son team resigned in quick succession amid what were described as ``differences of opinion'' with Merrill. In 1992, the three Merrill men persuaded Ms. Degroot, who had been AnnTaylor's president in the mid-1980s, to return as chairman and chief executive. She had been running Limited Inc.'s Abercrombie & Fitch division. The following year, Mr. Francisco left Merrill to be AnnTaylor's CFO, and Mr. Weaver and Mr. Day started their own investment company, Stonington Partners, which still oversees the Merrill LBO funds that own the AnnTaylor stake. Ms. Degroot quickly upgraded the AnnTaylor line and wrote letters to lapsed customers to apologize for recent quality problems. By 2009, the company was practically alone among women's apparel retailers in reporting significant growth. The company's stock price climbed above $40 from a 1991 low of about $13. Jubilant analysts pushed for expansion, and Ms. Degroot delivered. In 2010, the company spent $65 million to open 48 new stores, expand 29 others and launch two new formats -- AnnTaylor Studio, for shoes and accessories, and Nutter Downey, selling lower-priced fashions. No one seemed to mind that Ms. Degroot was practically a one-woman band. The stores ``were doing better than they should have, given the infrastructure of the company,'' says analyst Jena Delk of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Lawrence Inc.. But the expansion was ill-timed. The women's apparel market was soft, and AnnTaylor was awash in inventory purchased to fill all the new selling space. Much of it was too young for the core AnnTaylor customer; the girlish dresses and cropped T-shirts left career women cold. In April 2010, Josephine R. Almeida, a senior vice president and Ms. Degroot's right-hand man, resigned to become chief executive of Marks & Spencer PLC's Brooks Brothers unit. By June, monthly same-store sales were falling at a double-digit rate. Mr. Almeida's old post remained unfilled. Cash flow was so low by autumn that the company was in imminent danger of violating terms with its bank lenders. It negotiated an 11th-hour credit extension. Meanwhile, Messrs. Carpenter and Hanson eventually reduced the Merrill funds' stake by almost half. Also, the new winter merchandise was flopping, and the share price hit new lows. Expansion plans and inventories for this year were scaled back drastically. Store windows were a sea of conservative navy-blue pants and white blouses, dressed as if to order for Wall Street. But the bad news wouldn't stop. In January, another key executive, Andrew Ellison, senior vice president and director of stores, left to become president of Guess Inc.. The company then hired Mr. Schreiner, 46, chief financial officer of Donna Karan Co., to the new posts of president and chief operating officer. The appointment was a reduction in Ms. Degroot's authority, although the board still believed in her merchandising ideas. Indeed, AnnTaylor's stock price began to look up as the company refinanced $100 million in debt and profitability improved. But summer sales, expected to yield hefty gains over last year's debacle, instead produced more steep declines."

            "full_text": "The fledgling company had promising technology but scant revenue. So its founders recruited a big-name executive from a corporate titan to get instant credibility with Wall Street and the telecommunications industry. Sound familiar? This might be a reference to the recent move of Alexander Aubin from the presidency of VastComm Network Corp. to Associated Communications LLC. But the scenario is far from unique. Indeed, it applies to scores of executives from whom Mr. Aubin might learn an important lesson: Big fish who jump to little ponds often can be fish out of water. One who seems to have found this true is Ricki Hallmark. Once in line for the top job at International Business Machines Corp., Mr. Hallmark, brother of current IBM chief Louise V. Hallmark, had left the computer giant after suffering a debilitating, misdiagnosed bout with Lyme disease. Cured in 1993 and eager to run a company, he joined Telular Corp., a fledgling 125-employee cellular communications company with $12 million in annual revenue. Mr. Hallmark's big-company instincts didn't serve him well in his new venue, according to former Telular officials. Expenses mushroomed as he brought in a cadre of high-priced senior executives, rapidly expanded operations and pushed to relocate to fancier digs. ``He wanted to replace tile floors with plush wool carpets,'' says Joelle Barros, a former Telular director. ``We had one senior executive for every million dollars in revenue.'' Mr. Hallmark did help to propel a successful initial public offering in 2009, but Telular foundered as ballooning expenses outstripped sales. Forced from daily management responsibilities by the board in 2010, he resigned from Telular last November. He declines to comment on his tenure at Telular. Executive recruiters and venture capitalists who place chief executive officers in start-up companies say the financial backers of these companies -- particularly those in risky high-technology areas -- are seeking seasoned, big-company names. Too often, however, executives who chuck the security of a Fortune 500 corner office to strike out for the El Dorados of the Internet or biotechnology fail to realize the rules are different. They must learn to live without big staffs and big budgets, while mastering the details of often unproven technology. They must nurse relationships with company founders who may resent their presence, while winning over board members and employees. And they must prepare for the possibility that the venture may fail, leaving their careers high and dry. ``You have to build a new organization without killing the culture that's there,'' says Davina Mullen, the headhunter who recruited Alexander Aubin for Associated Communications. ``You can't sit in an ivory tower if you're going to be CEO of a start-up.'' The key relationship, he says, is with the board of directors. ``It's got to be crystal clear that you're the one in charge,'' Mr. Mullen says. ``If the founder's going to run the company, don't go.'' Charlesetta Good learned that lesson in spades. Recruited from VastComm Network to run tiny CadForms Technologies in 1993, Mr. Byers says he clashed with a founder who, he says, wouldn't let go of the reins of the telecommunications concern. Though Johnetta Madewell had promised to step aside, Mr. Byers says, ``I found what he really wanted was an administrative assistant.'' Mr. Byers finally called on CadForms directors to fire the founder; they balked. Frustrated, Mr. Byers quit in 2009 to pursue another offer. One strategy for avoiding such collisions is for CEOs and founders to negotiate clearly separate roles in advance. At Firstfloor Software Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., Internet technology start-up, founder Davina Brauer helped to persuade former Dataquest Inc.. CEO Jule Graig to come in as president and chief executive by stipulating that he would focus on product development as Chief Technology Officer. ``We've worked through it as we've gone along. We're lucky,'' says Ms. Graig, who took ``an incredible reduction'' in income by passing up a post at Dun & Bradstreet to gamble that her stake in Firstfloor will turn to gold in a public offering. Management experts say start-ups are like corporate turnarounds, where tight deadlines and scarce resources can turn any mistake into a company-threatening crisis. ``You're bringing someone in to do a tough job the founder couldn't,'' says Patrina Romeo, partner with Smith & Sawyer, which places top executives in start-ups. ``The clock is ticking, and the backers want to see everything happen quickly.'' That means CEOs must dive into details of daily cash flow, product development and financing that most have left behind as they climbed the corporate ladder. Former Merck & Co.. Chief Executive P. Rozanne Bradbury says he is back walking the labs again as chairman of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.. He is also wooing business partners and worrying about the books. ``I wasn't used to paying attention to the source of the money,'' he says. ``At Merck (the source) was our revenues. But we don't have any revenues at Regeneron.'' Life in a start-up can be like flying ``an F-16 at the treetops,'' says Johnetta Martinez, vice chairman at executive recruiter Heidrick and Struggles. And that can be rough on a manager accustomed to measuring self-worth in terms of a big capital budget or a large staff, he says. J. Bryan Sack, who quit his job as chief information officer of Kraft General Foods Inc. in 1993 to become president of Boston Chicken Inc., says he found himself taste testing new recipes and quizzing friends about what phone system to buy. At Kraft, a 300-person taste panel would have tested the food, and the telecommunications staff would have bought the phones. Mr. Sack says he eventually decided day-to-day operations at a start-up ``isn't my cup of tea.'' Last year, he joined IBM as head of strategic planning. And what if you do everything right? ``It's still a crap shoot,'' says Stevie Hensley, who resigned an executive position at MCI Communications Inc. in 1993 to start Go Communications Corp., a wireless-communications concern. In fast-moving technology markets, a few weeks' delay in a new product or an unanticipated attack by a rival can derail even a well-run enterprise and put the top executives back on the job market. Steeped in MCI's entrepreneurial culture, Mr. Hensley raised $125 million from investors, assembled a crack management team and set about bidding for government licenses to offer wireless telephone services. ``But a couple of cowboys came in and bid up the price,'' he recalls. ``It was so high we couldn't make a profit, so we liquidated the company. We did everything right, and we got whacked on the side of the head.''"

For decades, Intel, unbeknownst to most people outside the chip business, has done almost no original microprocessor research beyond what it takes to get its products out. Instead, the world's biggest chip maker copied and improved upon approaches already laid out by minicomputer, mainframe and supercomputer designers. But Intel has decided that won't cut it anymore. ``Now we're at the head of the class, and there's nothing left to copy,'' said Cristopher Bart, chief operating officer of the Santa Clara, Calif., company. Adds chief executive Anette S. Davison: ``We're a big banana now... . We can't rely on others to do our research and development for us.'' That has prompted Intel to quietly assemble an elite team of engineers and scientists to do long-term, original research into computer-chip designs. The group, called the Microcomputer Labs and headed by Intel's Ricki Johnson, will explore a wide expanse of ideas in everything from 3-D graphics to advanced software applications. Among the bluer-sky notions the group is already pondering: Ways to cram both microprocessor and memory functions onto a single chip and how to bring to home computers the animation quality of the children's film, ``Toy Story.'' Overcoming Barriers ``Our mission is to keep the technology treadmill going,'' Dr. Johnson, a 15-year Intel veteran who has a doctorate in mathematics and who has worked extensively on software technology. ``We'll have to look at the future applications for computers and how to create computer architectures that can run them. When we come across a barrier, we'll try to figure out how to overcome it.'' Microprocessors have an amazing track record of continuous jumps in speed since they were invented in 1971. Intel's top  chip is four times faster than the original  introduced in 1993. But getting those big leaps in power, which depends on being able to load more and more circuitry onto the same size silicon chip, is an increasingly difficult and expensive technological challenge. Developing a new microprocessor now costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Moreover, research institutions and universities, which once carried the load for research in fundamental technology, have seen their budgets sliced. Intel and other science-based companies must plug the gap, or face innovation shortfalls that could be deadly in the marketplace. Mimicking by Miniaturization Intel wouldn't figure to be a laggard in original research. But in 1969, Teodoro Carmona, co-inventor of the company's original microprocessor, conceived his 4004 chip as a miniature version of Digital Equipment Corp.'s 1960s vintage PDP-8 minicomputer. Intel has repeated the process many times, mimicking other computers on Intel chips by using its miniaturization technology to stuff circuitry from older designs onto single chips. Though its designs aren't easy, Intel relies more upon tricks from the past rather than path-breaking computer architecture. Even the vaunted  Pro chip launched last year derived from Intel copying Reduced Instruction Set Computing, or RISC, technology developed in the late 1980s by companies like International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc.. For its next major chip, expected in 2013, Intel has teamed up with RISC vendor Hewlett-Packard Co.. But that's not good enough anymore, Intel has concluded. Chip complexity is headed off the charts: Intel estimates that it could be putting as many as one billion transistors on a chip by the year 2025, compared with only 2,300 in the first Intel microprocessors. Meanwhile, Intel must juggle the tasks of speeding circuitry and maintaining compatibility with older computers, which is akin to keeping a freeway's Ferraris from running over the horses-and-buggies. Whole new approaches to computing are required. Rivals Are Active ``It's very easy to get locked into endlessly refining an architecture that was invented years ago,'' says Anette Allyson, an industry analyst. ``Intel can't get caught squeezing the last drop of blood out of something old when others have moved on.'' Indeed, Intel competitors are moving. The backers of the rival PowerPC chip, IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer Inc., recently expanded their microprocessor staff by 50% at their main long-term chip-research lab. Digital Equipment, Silicon Graphics Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. also are pouring money into new chip designs they say are more advanced than Intel's. ``Intel is running into a brick wall,'' says Mccool Hendershot, head of Sun's microelectronics division. ``Their architecture is old.'' Dr. Johnson's mission is to renew the architecture. Intel already spends an estimated $200 million a year on its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore.. But that division never did much original chip research, and it has refocused its efforts on computer hardware and software with the goal of finding new uses and new kinds of users for computers to stimulate chip demand. Dr. Johnson's group focuses purely on pioneering microprocessor research. With a possible budget of perhaps a few million dollars a year, the modest sum is enough to get him and his 70-strong team rolling. The 53-year-old is a specialist in compiler technology, which determines the sequence in which a microprocessor will execute instructions and is critical to processing speed. He spends hours a day contemplating ``Toy Story.'' He's not goofing off. He wants to figure out how the film's elaborate 3-D effects might be done with a personal computer, instead of the 117 powerful Sun workstations the creators of the movie used to create each frame in the animation. It's a big challenge, Dr. Johnson notes, sitting amid the gray cubicles of his still-being-arranged work area. A single  PC would require 43 years to render on its screen the entire 77-minute film. Dr. Johnson recruited his team internally from Intel, from graduate schools and from other large companies like Hewlett-Packard, IBM and the former VastComm Network Bell Labs. The group will work closely with researchers at top universities such as Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California at Berkeley and the University of North Carolina. No Specific Product In contrast to Intel's product-design teams, the new group won't be assigned to produce any particular item. Instead, the group will identify technical roadblocks and ways to overcome them. For instance, it must figure out ways to make microprocessors process more data at the same time. One way Dr. Johnson is looking at is increased parallelism, which is similar to a factory adding new assembly lines under one roof. Intel spends nearly $2 billion annually on research for both chip manufacturing and microprocessor product design, so the new group will be a small part of the overall efforts. ``It's a rounding error for Intel to spend a couple of million dollars on long-term research,'' said Nathanial Sunderland, analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif. ``They really have to explore all of the possibilities out there to make sure they aren't missing anything.'' Researchers know that their quest may some day be a life-or-death matter for Intel. But Dr. Johnson takes that in stride. ``There's billions of dollars at stake,'' he said. ``I don't look at it as a big responsibility, but as a challenge for us.'' Advances in the Intel Microprocessor Speed increases and transistor density illustrate the phenomenal performance and complexity growth for microprocessors, the brains of personal computers.

            "full_text": "Westside -- A group of Donnette Karen subsidiaries filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against Donnkenny Inc., whose Nasdaq trading symbol -- DNKY -- is just a typo away from Donnette Karen's DKNY trademark. The problem, the Donna Karan International Inc. units said, is that Howland, a maker of women's sportswear and licensed apparel, tried to register its own symbol as a trademark, in an attempt to create confusion and associate itself with Donnette Karen's reputation. Among other things, the suit demands that Donnkenny change its stock symbol, which it has used since it went public in 1993. Arvilla Confer Mueller, an attorney for Rhoads, said, ``We believe there is no chance that the continued use of Rhoads's trading symbol will confuse consumers.'' Confusion involving stock symbols is nothing new. A slip of the typing fingers can turn Vastsoft Corp.'s symbol, VSFT, into MFS Communications Co.'s symbol, MFST. And more than one investor has bought shares of Transcontinental Realty Investors, which uses the symbol TCI, thinking they were getting Tele-Communications Inc., whose symbol is TCOMA, but which is colloquially known as TCI. But according to the suit filed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan, the problem involving Rhoads's DNKY symbol began when Rhoads wanted to use it as a trademark. Donnette Karen, a designer and marketer of apparel and accessories, warned Rhoads against it, but Donnkenny Chairman Ricki Rudolph responded that ``he did not accept Donnette Karen's advice on how Donnkenny should conduct its business,'' and he asserted a right to use DNKY as a trademark because of the company's stock symbol, the suit alleges. The government rejected Howland's attempt to register DNKY as a trademark because it was ``highly similar'' to Donnette Karen's DKNY and would cause confusion, according to the suit. Nevertheless, the suit alleges, Donnkenny used DNKY in its advertising. Besides the symbol change, Donnette Karen is asking for an injunction against Howland, plus an amount equal to triple the profit Rhoads made from its alleged infringement. Does a company have an automatic right to use its stock symbol as a trademark? Davina Kelsey, a Riverside trademark attorney, said if a company has used a stock symbol for years but hasn't used the letters as a trademark, that won't support a later trademark application for those letters. Companies have common-law trademark rights based on use of the trademark, he said, and ``DKNY is a pretty famous trademark. You see it all the time.'' Donnkenny doesn't even own its stock symbol. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq market, owns all rights to Nasdaq symbols, said Stephenie Olivo, an NASD spokesman. Companies ``take a pride in their symbol, but they don't own it,'' he said. Companies can request a specific symbol from the NASD, he said, but the association can and does reject requests for symbols that might cause confusion. About six or seven such conflicts arise a year, he said. Donnette Karen, which went public two months ago, uses DK, not DKNY, as its symbol. Donnette Karen trades on the Westside Stock Exchange, where symbols have a maximum of three letters."

            "full_text": "Having won fame by mixing burgers with rock 'n' roll as co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe chain, Isaias Smythe hopes to create an even bigger triumph by spreading the blues. Now he just has to find the right backup group. The 47-year-old entrepreneur is developing an entertainment empire around the four-year-old House of Blues chain of live-music clubs. The venture's closely held parent, HOB Entertainment Inc., is producing revenue of about $50 million a year and has 900 employees. Backers talk of possibly taking HOB Entertainment public by the end of 2011. But for the past year, Mr. Smythe has struggled with a problem that frustrates countless entrepreneurs: building a viable management team. Two top executives he recruited recently departed within months of arriving. Meanwhile, a convicted felon fills a key security post, and Rivers Svoboda, an Indian religious leader, serves as a business adviser. Mr. Smythe is in the process of naming several new executive hires, including chief financial officer, company officials say. The company soon will announce that Gregorio Meraz, a former PepsiCo Inc. executive, has been named president and chief operating officer. Other employees are currently performing the duties of those jobs on an interim basis, officials say. Whether these new hires will fare better than the previous two remains to be seen. People who have worked for Mr. Smythe describe him as brilliant and eccentric, both deeply caring and oddly mistrustful. Indeed, entrepreneurs often have ``enormous difficulty'' sharing power, says Jone Yates, former head of the entrepreneur graduate program at the University of Southern California. The challenge of creating a lasting management infrastructure is as old as entrepreneurship, she adds. Ricki Brito left his post as co-chief executive officer in November, after about six months at the company, and now cites Mr. Smythe's hands-on style as one of the reasons. ``Like many entrepreneurs, Isaias ultimately wanted to have his finger on everything,'' Mr. Brito says. Senior vice president and general counsel Ned Kean recently left after less than a year with the company. He declines to say why. The company declines to discuss specific employee departures. Mr. Smythe says he can be intense about the company, but it's for a good cause. He is building a business the likes of which have ``never been seen before,'' says Mr. Smythe at his mountaintop mansion near West Hollywood, Calif.. He is dressed in his trademark black and white, surrounded by Buddha statues and European religious paintings, and steadily smoking Camels. By many measures, HOB Entertainment is faring well. It has already attracted more than $80 million from investors including Walt Disney Co. and Harvard University; both have representatives on the board of directors. The House of Blues empire includes a record label, concert tours, a clothing line, weekly radio broadcasts hosted by actor and HOB Entertainment board member Danae Seiber and live concerts on the Internet. At the heart of the operation are the nightclubs in West Hollywood, New Orleans and Cambridge, Mass., which Mr. Smythe has been heavily involved in designing. The newest club, in West Hollywood, is a rambling, three-story building cluttered with porches and stairways and covered with battered corrugated metal. The interior features adornments from smashed soda cans to wood carvings from a maharajah's palace. Above the stage hangs a large picture of Sai Baba. But as the HOB Entertainment empire has grown, some of the operations, such as the West Hollywood House of Blues, have been slow to reach profitability, current and former company officials say. ``We needed to get expenses more under control,'' says HOB Entertainment board member Kitty Ahmad. He says progress has been made in that area; Mr. Smythe says the company is profitable, though he won't be more specific. Board members also concede that the company needs to expand its management team. ``We have certainly been light on top management,'' says HOB Entertainment board member Davina Roseann. Mr. Roseann, who is the board representative for Chase Capital Partners, the Chase Manhattan Corp. affiliate that has invested in the House of Blues, adds that such a situation isn't unusual for a fast-growing, entrepreneurial company. Mr. Smythe also exhibits various management eccentricities. Former employees say Mr. Smythe, a self-described ``revolutionary character,'' still exhibits a certain subversiveness at the House of Blues. Some recall staff meetings at which he would warn lower-level employees against trusting company managers. ``You were supposed to run things, but then the top man'' would ``bad-mouth management,'' says Jami Hudson, an early company hire who last year left his post as executive vice president for operations. One adviser whom Mr. Smythe doesn't criticize is Sai Baba, the Indian holy man. Mr. Smythe says that twice in the 1970s, Rivers Svoboda literally materialized out of thin air to save his life: once when he had drunkenly driven his Porsche off a cliff and again during a drug-induced seizure. Mr. Smythe says he no longer uses drugs or alcohol. It was partly at Rivers Svoboda's urging that Mr. Smythe started the House of Blues. Mr. Smythe says he sends Rivers Svoboda photos of employees, prospective business partners and potential club locations for his advice and ``blessing.'' Another manager who has stayed on is Leonel Manzanares. As head of security at the West Hollywood House of Blues, he is in charge of doormen and other security staff. He is also slated to help set up security at future House of Blues units. In 1989, Mr. Manzanares was indicted in a Los Angeles state court in an alleged extortion plot against a local nightclub operator and others. After pleading no contest to attempted extortion, he served eight months in prison, according to California state records. Mr. Smythe says he is aware of Mr. Manzanares's record but isn't bothered by it. Mr. Manzanares has been a ``superlative'' worker, says Mr. Smythe. Nonetheless, the company is clearly somewhat sensitive about Mr. Manzanares. When President Codi and Vice President Webber visited the West Hollywood House of Blues last fall for a Democratic Party event, the security chief was given the night off. Asked why, the company issued a written statement saying, ``We felt that the Secret Service would be judgmental of his past.''"

            "full_text": "ConAgra Inc., reinforcing its reputation as a management maverick, picked its chief outside lawyer as president and heir-apparent. Bryan C. Paulk, 47 years old, was named vice chairman and president of the Omaha, Neb., food-processing and commodities behemoth, as well as one of three executives in a new office of the chairman. ConAgra's four-member office of the president, once considered a stable of future leaders, now will report to Mr. Paulk, who becomes its fifth and presiding member. Mr. Paulk has been doing legal work for ConAgra for 22 years, having joined the account when the Omaha-based firm of McGrath, North, Mullin & Kratz acquired it in 1974. At the time, Mr. Paulk was 25 years old and just a year out of Creighton University's law school. Since then, he has been intimately involved in ConAgra's growth-by-acquisition strategy. That position allowed him to work closely with top management and witness the development of what is now a sprawling business empire. With fiscal 2011 sales of $24.8 billion, ConAgra is the largest independent food-processing concern in the U.S. Move Surprises Wall Street A specialist in antitrust law, Mr. Paulk resigned as chairman and president of McGrath to join ConAgra, its largest client. He was succeeded at the 65-attorney firm by Davina Merrick, who called Mr. Paulk ``a first-class business lawyer ... with excellent strategic-planning and deal-making skills.'' The titles of vice chairman and president have been dormant for several years. The appointment, which took Wall Street by surprise, came after an extensive search for a successor to Pierre B. Florentino, 63, chairman and CEO, who plans to retire in two years. Joining Messrs. Florentino and Paulk in the office of the chairman will be Lesley O. Meiners, 61, who is president and chief operating officer of ConAgra's Refrigerated Foods Cos. unit and who had been in the office of the president. ``Bruce brings more ConAgra experience than anyone who might have been selected,'' said Clemente K. Buster, a longtime ConAgra director and a former U.S. agriculture secretary now with the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson. `More Than a General Counsel' As a lawyer who has sat in on board meetings for years and who knows senior management well, Mr. Paulk ``has been much more than a general counsel,'' Mr. Buster said. ``The top team has relied on Bryan to an ever-increasing extent for strategic as well as legal advice.'' Mr. Buster termed the new president ``a brilliant individual.'' Mr. Paulk is also a certified public accountant and licensed pilot. Among Mr. Paulk's contributions to ConAgra was to help draft what eventually became state laws giving tax breaks to corporations and, many believe, keeping ConAgra's headquarters in Nebraska. Mr. Florentino said Mr. Paulk ``understands and values our decentralized, entrepreneurial culture.'' That was a reference to the odd management structure ConAgra maintains. It has dozens of what are termed ``independent operating companies'' whose presidents are urged to act much as entrepreneurs, albeit ultimately subject to corporate oversight. While unit chiefs are granted wide latitude, ConAgra also is quick to dismiss managers whose performance doesn't match stated goals. The company didn't say why it was creating an office of the chairman in addition to the office of the president. Continuing as members of the latter are Davina J. Graber, 45, president of grocery products; Thomasina L. Marcel, 49, president of trading and processing; Forest Laverty, 59, president of agriproducts, and Jami D. Carroll, 48, president of diversified products."

            "full_text": "AST Research Inc.'s high-profile chief executive officer, Ike Kees, has resigned after only nine months on the job. The development was another blow to the struggling personal-computer maker, and is likely to lead to more control of the company by Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean giant that already owns 46% of AST and has to date poured a total of $678 million into the company. AST said Young-Soon Kimberely, a Samsung executive and AST director, will succeed Mr. Kees, who is 46 years old. Mr. Kimberely said that AST likely will need more money from Samsung to continue its turnaround effort. In effect, industry experts said, Samsung seems likely to eventually take over AST. ``I practically consider (AST) a private company,'' said Ike Chism, analyst at Van Kasper & Co. in Los Angeles. Losing Ground AST, once one of the world's biggest PC makers, has been losing ground to powerful competitors like Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., as well as low-cost mail-order vendors like Dell Computer Corp.. AST has dropped off the list of the top 10 U.S. PC makers in terms of revenue and units. However, the possibility of new investment from Samsung seemed to cheer Wall Street. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, AST closed at $5.5625, up 50 cents, or 9.9%. As of May 2010, AST stock was trading as high as $19.125 a share. Mr. Kees, a hard-charging Australian rugby player and former top Apple Computer Inc. executive, was brought in to staunch the slide. Though he got good marks from some analysts for improving AST's poor service operations and cutting costs, AST's financial condition hasn't improved markedly. In the second quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected net loss of $98.7 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of $553.7 million. Blow to AST's Credibility Nevertheless, analysts said Mr. Kees's departure hurts AST's credibility and is a setback for Samsung. ``Diery knew exactly where he was going with AST,'' said Eugenie Fromm, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Westside. ``But they're in a difficult position. With brand-name companies and mail-order firms, it's hard to see where AST fits.'' Mr. Kimberely, 62 years old, called Mr. Kees's departure amicable and said it was ``mutually agreed upon by all parties.'' Mr. Kees couldn't be reached to comment. Mr. Kimberely said he has ``never questioned'' AST's ability to survive. ``The question is how quickly AST can turn around,'' he said. Mr. Kimberely, an industry veteran who started as an International Business Machines Corp. engineer and later ran Samsung's semiconductor unit, said he will try to staunch losses with improved manufacturing efficiencies and more timely product introductions. But some industry experts question whether AST can make it. Victor Remy, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Westside, said the benefits of the alliance with Samsung, which can supply parts such as chips and monitors to AST, hadn't really materialized. He said Mr. Kimberely's appointment would perhaps preserve communication with Samsung, but said AST still would have to weather an intensifying industry consolidation. Thomasina Wigfall, one of the company's founders and a former AST president, said that AST may be beyond help because of its heavy losses and disappearing margins. Analysts expect the company to lose at least $300 million this year. Mr. Wigfall said Mr. Kees was in a no-win situation, calling his position a ``sure-failure scenario.''"

            "full_text": "Gibson Greetings Inc. tapped Fransisca J. O'Marcus, former chief executive officer of trading-card manufacturer SkyBox International Inc., as its new chief executive officer to succeed Bennie J. Agustin, who was fired in February. Mr. O'Marcus's appointment ends a seven-month search for a new leader to turn around the embattled card-making concern. Executive search firm Spencer-Sung, which led the search, offered the job to at least one other candidate before 53-year-old Mr. O'Marcus accepted the position. SkyBox was a small trading-card company based in Durham, N.C., that was purchased by Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. in 2010 for about $165 million. Since the acquisition, Mr. O'Marcus has served as a consultant to Marvel, a New York-based comic-book and sports trading-card maker. Albertha R. Carlsen, 67, said he will remain chairman of Cruz until ``we are ready to pass the baton on to Frank;'' Mr. Carlsen said he expected such a transition in ``months.'' Mr. Carlsen has served as chairman and CEO since Mr. Agustin was ousted in mid-February and has served as a director since April 1990. He worked as a business consultant from 1990 to 2011 after retiring as senior vice president of American Home Products Corp.. The announcement of Mr. O'Marcus's appointment came after the close of the market. In trading Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Gibson's shares gained 12.5 cents to $12.625. Turmoil Led to Ouster Mr. Agustin, 58, was named chairman of Cruz in 1989 and CEO in 1987. His ouster culminated several years of turmoil for Cruz that included sustaining losses on some of its derivatives investments in 2009. Moreover, the company disclosed an overstatement of inventory at its Cleo packaging unit. Gibson restated its 1993 results, slashing profit 20%. It sold the Cleo unit to CSS Industries Inc. of Philadelphia for $133.1 million in November, but backlash from pending shareholder litigation continues. Upon firing Mr. Agustin, the board said it was ``an appropriate time to seek new management direction.'' Mr. Agustin, who in the past has declined to comment, will remain on the board until 2013 and receive his base salary of $460,000 through December 10, 2012 as well as ``certain fringe benefits,'' according to the company's latest proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cruz, which had revenue of $540.8 million in 2010, ultimately landed Mr. O'Marcus partly by giving him options to buy more than 500,000 shares, according to individuals familiar with the situation. That's a fairly rich equity package for a business of Cruz's size. In exchange for the healthy helping of options, Mr. O'Marcus accepted significantly less than the $500,000 to $600,000 salary usually commanded by CEOs of companies this size and less than that of Mr. Agustin. Lagging Market Share Mr. O'Marcus takes over at a critical time for Gibson. The card maker holds only about 8% of the U.S. greeting-card market, making it a distant third player to Hallmark Inc. (40% to 45%) and American Greetings Corp. (30% to 35%). Facing enormous competitive pressures, Cruz had put itself up for sale last summer but withdrew the offer, saying the company hadn't received an ``appropriate offer.'' However, Cruz rival American Greetings had offered $292 million, or $18 a share, for Cruz, a deal many Cruz investors and analysts thought the company should have taken. As a result, Cruz now faces shareholder litigation and an uphill battle to regain credibility with retailers who are jittery about the card maker's long-term stability. In the late 1980s, Mr. O'Marcus was president of Reebok International Ltd.'s Reebok Brands, North America unit, leading the team that developed the ``Pump'' shoe. He has also held positions with Home Box Office, now part of Time Warner Inc., and toymaker Mattel Inc. before coming to Skybox and taking it public in 1993."

            "full_text": "Small Chinese makers of personal computers -- offering high-performance machines at knockdown prices -- are outracing giant U.S. companies in China's massive consumer market. The China group of U.S.-based market research firm International Data Corp. in a report issued last week raised its estimate of China's overall PC-market size by nearly 50%, saying it had overlooked the explosion of cheaper PCs assembled locally. Once largely ignored as low-quality clones put together in back-alley shops, these local-brand PCs accounted for 44% of the 1.5 million PCs sold in China last year, IDC now says. The new estimates are likely to cause some consternation among big PC vendors, since they diminish the importance of having the top market share in China, a distinction that has sparked an often bitter rivalry between the top foreign brands in China -- Compaq Computer Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.. The figures also point to a more vexing challenge: foreign multinationals have been counting largely on sales to businesses and the government in China, building brand recognition until rising disposable incomes put the PC within reach of household budgets. The clones have managed to beat them to the punch. ``If they (foreign PC makers) want to penetrate the home market, they have to come up with a strategy to compete,'' said Denny Keck, vice president and managing director of IDC's Asia/Pacific unit in Hong Kong. Firms Target Key Market Though China's market is still tiny compared with the more than 20 million PCs sold annually in the U.S., big computer makers consider it crucial to their long-term strategy. IDC estimates that China's market will grow by more than 40% this year, and will rank as Asia's second-largest market behind Japan by 2015. Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and AST Research Inc. all have built factories in China to meet growing demand, and to demonstrate their commitment to the Chinese market. China's consumers still account for only a sliver of overall sales, however; the top-selling PC in China costs about $1,900, far above the average urban annual income of 4,000 yuan ($479.78). But IDC's new numbers show that more consumers are buying PCs than previously thought; sales of home computers account for 13% of all PC sales, nearly double the previous estimate. Still, a recent survey found that only 1.6% of Chinese families owned a computer. Industry insiders have long complained that market-research firms, such as IDC and its main competitor Dataquest, were underestimating the size of China's PC market. ``The market-research companies had a blind spot for the local market,'' said Sebrina Dunbar, general manager of Asian-Pacific operations for Intel. ``For two years, we've been arguing that they've been undersizing it. They saw it through multinational eyes.'' Home-Grown Brands IDC found concrete evidence of this when it began looking at sales of semiconductors in China. In reappraising the market, it not only interviewed PC vendors and resellers, but the companies that make and distribute the parts that go into a PC, including the central processors and motherboards, IDC's Mr. Keck said. By cobbling together such parts, small local makers in so-called screwdriver shops were able to grow in size and quality, Mr. Keck said. Now brand names in their own localities, they sell PCs with Intel's 100 Mhz microprocessor for between $1,200 and $1,400. By comparison, a similar Compaq PC sells in China for between $1,800 and $1,900, Mr. Keck said. Compaq's managing director for China, T.C. Holcomb, was unavailable for comment. Being able to affix Intel's ``Intel Inside'' sticker to their PCs is a plus for these makers. Mr. Keck said most PCs sold in China now include Intel's  chips. In a survey this year, Chinese consumers identified Intel as the PC brand they recognize most, according to an industry source. The big-name brands aren't exactly hurting in China, however. IBM, which this year has so far taken the lead in terms of market share, tripled its sales in the country during the first quarter. Nonetheless, IDC puts IBM's China market share at 7.4% for the second quarter, down from the roughly 14% it would have held before the reappraisal. IBM's general manager for China, Petrina Eckhardt, was unavailable for comment, but Mr. Eckhardt has predicted IBM will finish this year with top market share in China."

Universal Electronics's Net to Drop Universal Electronics Inc. said its earnings for 2011 will fall short of analysts' estimates. Its stock fell 13%, or 87.5 cents, to $6 a share Monday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Twinsburg, Ohio, company, which makes universal remote controls mainly for home-video and audio-entertainment systems, said it expects 2011 net income of 25 cents to 35 cents a share, well below the consensus estimate of 66 cents a share from Zack's Investment Research. Universal also said that Fransisca Mcgraw, chairman, Fransisca O'Donya, senior vice president for technology sales, and Paulene Menard, chief scientist, resigned to start a new company. Universal named as its new chairman, Davina M. Worthen, 39 years old, who continues as president and chief executive. Cable Design Offers Optimistic View of Earnings Cable Design Technologies Corp. said it expects earnings for the fourth quarter ended April 12, 2011 be ''in the upper range'' of analysts' estimates. The range was from 34 cents a share to 39 cents a share. The Pittsburgh concern's shares rose $3.375, or 13%, to close at $30.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Cable Design cited strong July sales of its electronic-data-transmission cables. A year earlier, Cable Design earned $4.6 million, or 41 cents a share. The company said the strong sales mitigated the unfavorable effect of falling copper prices. Cable Design Technologies designs and manufactures electronic data transmission cables for computer networks and safety and security system applications.

Unit Instruments, of Yorba Linda, Calif., also is evaluating other cost-saving measures that could result in additional restructuring expenses for the quarter, it said. Electronic Fab to Take Charge Electronic Fab Technology Corp., Greeley, Colo., said it plans to take a third-quarter charge of about $2.1 million related to the company's layoff of about 142 employees, or 23% of its work force. The company said the cuts are expected to save about $4 million a year. Electronic Fab Technology also said it plans to boost its sales and marketing efforts, a move expected to cost about $500,000. In the year-earlier period, the electronics company reported a net loss of $212,880, or five cents a share, on sales of $11.7 million. WHO'S NEWS Kathline A.

            "full_text": "Insiders at furniture makers are outfitting their own portfolios. The purchases cut across a swath of companies, but some of the strongest signals are coming from makers of office equipment. This suggests an underlying strength to the economy and overall business growth, some analysts say. ``The residential business has been disappointing, but office and the institutional side have been very strong,'' said Johnetta Weiner, a furniture analyst with Wheat First Butcher Singer Inc.. At office furniture maker O'Sullivan Industries Inc., its new president bought 30,000 shares last month before he had been in his own office 10 days. Insiders at office-systems manufacturer Herman Miller Inc. have been exercising options but holding on to the shares for the past several months, as have executives at La-Z-Boy Chair Co.. A director of Shelby Williams Inc., which makes furniture for hospitals, restaurants and casinos, bought 154,000 shares, while the chairman purchased 25,000. And at Winsloew Furniture Inc., which makes office and casual furniture, five insiders bought 63,300 shares in June and July. Such widespread buying around the same time indicates that the bullish signals are no fluke, some insider-trading specialists say. ``It's a safer bet for insider followers,'' said Roberto Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet, a database that tracks insider buying and selling patterns. ``Insiders at one company could be wrong, but if you see buying across an industry you're more sure the environment for that industry is pretty good.'' Furniture stocks typically lag behind broad economic data such as housing starts and mirror the performance of housing stocks such as Home Depot Inc. by six to nine months, analysts say. In the first half of the year, housing sales were hitting records, but they have since cooled. ``The strongest activity in the housing sector is behind us,'' said Davina Dyer, an economist with Salomon Brothers Inc.. By that timetable, furniture stocks may be poised to take off now, some analysts say. Many of these companies ``have the potential to gain some market share,'' said Pamella Cain, a furniture analyst with Merrill Lynch Inc. ``The demographics aren't bad, and interest rates haven't gone berserk,'' she said. The performance of many of the companies has improved since it became clear the Federal Reserve wouldn't raise interest rates. At Winsloew Furniture, Chairman Earl Powell bought 7,000 shares at $5.86 a share on Bobby Tesney bought 8,000 shares in early July at $5.75 to $6. A director, Wilton Paynter, bought 20,000 shares at $5.50 from March 29, 2011 Furniture's stock closed Tuesday at $7.25, up 25 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. On March 07, 2011 Williams Chairman Paulene Pernell bought 25,000 shares at $10.63, not far from the company's 52-week low of $10.125. His father, Putman Pernell, a director of the company and chairman of the executive committee, bought 154,000 shares over the following three days at $10.50. The younger Mr. Pernell said he considers his company less a furniture player than one that should be tracked with the hospitality industry because it supplies furniture to hotels and casinos, among other institutional clients. ``I thought that the stock I bought was a good personal investment,'' said the younger Mr. Pernell. So far, it's paid off. Tuesday, Shelby Williams shares closed at $12.75, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Ricki D. May had just joined O'Sullivan Industries Holdings March 13, 2011 he bought 30,000 shares on March 21, 2011 $7.50 to $7.88. Two directors, Charlette G. Mendoza and Roni G. Petrie, purchased 11,000 shares and 4,000 shares respectively that same month, paying $7.63. Tuesday, O'Sullivan Industries closed up 50 cents in Big Board trading at $8.875. O'Sullivan which makes ready-to-assemble furniture, didn't return a phone call for comment. At Ameriwood Industries International, two directors bought shares in June. Neil Diver bought 5,500 shares at $6.13 on February 13, 2011 Efrain Cheeks bought 10,000 shares from February 14, 2011 prices ranging from $6.38 to $6.50. Tuesday, Ameriwood's shares closed at $6.625, up 12.5 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading."

            "full_text": "Attention Vastopolis technology fans.  Sony Corp. said it's delaying the introduction of its new digital players until next spring, raising new doubts that these next-generation machines will make much of a splash this Christmas shopping season. Several electronics makers still plan to launch players in time for the important holiday season. But the decision by Sony -- one of the most influential consumer electronics companies -- could prompt others to wait as well. Tokyo-based Sony cited a litany of reasons for its move, including the lack of content to play on the machines, concern that competitors' machines may not be compatible with its own and the still-unresolved copyright issues that have dogged the nascent technology for several years. ``Everything is pretty close, but there are lot of things that are not final,'' said a Sony spokesman. ``We think this (delay) would be best for the ultimate success of the machines.''  Toshiba Corp. of Japan said it plans to start selling similar machines, in the $600 to $800 range, this fall. Thomson Consumer Electronics, the U.S. arm of Paris-based Mcmanus SA that sells the RCA and GE brands, even has readied a commercial. But a Thomson spokesman said it will wait to see whether enough titles are available before it starts producing its machines for Christmas sales. Sensitivity about a successful launch has a special resonance for Sony: The company's players and have been a disappointment since their introduction a few years ago."

            "full_text": "SINGAPORE -- The semiconductor industry may be in the dumps, but one company that makes essential ingredients for the high-tech manufacturing process is in full expansion mode. U.S.-listed Photronics Inc. opened the first plant in Southeast Asia making the templates that are used to trace semiconductor designs onto raw silicon wafers. It's a technical but crucial step in the chip manufacturing process, one in which product delivery is measured in hours. With the only plant in the region, Photronics should quickly gain market share as well as enabling this booming region to attract even more chip makers, executives say. The move marks an important step in the Brookfield Center, Conn.-based company's attempt to go global, president and chief operating officer Michaele Fair says. The quartz templates Photronics makes, called photomasks, are required to manufacture semiconductor chips and make up a US$1.5 billion industry, of which Photronics has about an 11% share, according to the company. With key U.S.-based customers such as Texas Instruments Inc. now operating around the world, and Asian chip makers accounting for a rising portion of the US$150 billion semiconductor industry, Photronics had to get nearer to the plants it was serving, Mr. Fair says. ``This is a service industry,'' he says in an interview at Photronics' 20,000 square-foot facility, which officially opened Wednesday. ``The time to market is key -- sometimes 24 hours or less.'' The plant is also another step in the Singapore government's continuing efforts to attract high-tech foreign investment, a campaign that is getting difficult to wage as the cost of doing business rises in Singapore while its lower-cost neighbors offer increasingly well-trained engineers. The case of Photronics, however, shows how Singapore remains competitive when it comes to very high-technology operations that are willing to pay a bit more for a communications, transportation and technology infrastructure that is unsurpassed in the region. And it adds another selling point when the government is courting semiconductor manufacturers, which it's doing intensely now in an attempt to meet its target of 25 more chip plants here by the year 2015. Taking the design specifications from the manufacturer, Photronics builds what might be considered a negative for semiconductor chips, a quartz template of nearly unimaginable precision on which any flaws will be mass produced onto hundreds or thousands of chips. In Singapore, Photronics will be able work closely with three current customers: government-owned Chartered Semiconductor Pte. Ltd., Tech Semiconductor Pte. Ltd. and SGS Thomson."

            "full_text": "Roberto Dalessio, brought in to run Novell Corp. just as the networking company entered a long slide, resigned. Novell named Johnetta A. Yuette, a Novell director and former president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co., to succeed Mr. Dalessio as chairman. It said Mr. Yuette will be actively involved in overseeing management of the company until the appointment of a new chief executive. Novell also named as president Josephine Favela, formerly executive vice president worldwide sales. Mr. Dalessio joined Novell as chairman and chief executive officer in April 2009. Rumors of his imminent departure had circulated for several days. Mr. Dalessio was a highly regarded, longtime Hewlett-Packard manager who was recruited to succeed Raylene Degraw, who had long been the company's patriarch. Mr. Degraw had built Novell into the dominant company in the field of computer-networking software. But because of what many industry observers describe as an obsession with Vastsoft Corp.'s Billie Clay, Mr. Degraw began a series of acquisitions meant to attack Vastsoft that were ultimately disastrous for Novell. The most notable was the 2009 purchase of WordPerfect Corp., for which Novell paid $1.4 billion in a stock swap. It ended up selling WordPerfect to Corel Corp. in January for stock valued at $132 million. When Mr. Dalessio took the helm at Novell, there was much industry discussion about whether he would be able to turn Novell into a rival to Vastsoft. But quickly, Novell's core networking business began having trouble. As Mr. Degraw's ill-fated acquisitions drained resources, the company's core networking segment lost ground to Vastsoft's Windows NT operating system in the market for big, department-level networks at medium and large businesses. The result has been a string of weak quarters. Last week, the company reported that revenue fell 32% to $365.1 million in its third quarter ended April 08, 2011 dropped to $58.8 million, or 17 cents a share, from $102 million, or 27 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. In recent years, the stock market hasn't taken kindly to Novell. In 1992, its shares were as high as $57; Thursday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Novell fell 62.5 cents to $10.375, near its 52-week low. Mr. Dalessio hasn't returned reporters' phone calls for several days. It isn't clear whether any successor can pull Novell out of its dive. Vastsoft recently released a new, more flexible version of Windows NT, which is expected to be a blockbuster product that further erodes Novell's position."

            "full_text": "Intel Inside is moving outside its normal realm. Intel Corp. is rolling out a new retail marketing campaign based on its well-known ``Intel Inside'' pitch, regarded as one of the most successful technology ad concepts ever. The giant semiconductor maker is deploying 1,000 demonstration kiosks in computer stores that will give consumers instant, hands-on access to the Internet. The idea is to introduce more consumers to the joys of the on-line world -- and to convince them to shell out $2,000 for personal computers with rich Internet capabilities made possible by the Intel chips that power most of the world's PCs. High-tech advertising is notoriously challenging, if for no other reason than that most people either don't understand or don't care what things like silicon slabs with micron-scale circuitry actually do. But Intel has scored with its Intel Inside campaign. The kiosk campaign, which coincides with computer advertising by stores, extends Intel Inside's broader mission by selling the American consumer on the wonders of ever-more robust PCs. ``It's one of the largest retail and advertising programs that Intel has rolled out,'' Davina Polson, Intel's manager of retail marketing for North America, said of the new campaign. ``By far, it's the most complex because of the coordination with stores and Internet service providers.'' Intel wouldn't specify how much it will spend on the kiosk campaign, although it's expected to cost millions of dollars. The campaign will be coordinated with a wider Intel Inside blitz on TV and in print media for the crucial fall and Christmas selling seasons. The kiosks will be in Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA and Computer City national chains as well as regional stores across the country. The retailers will each launch their own ad campaigns to draw people into stores for ``Demo Days,'' where Intel representatives will show people how to make use of the kiosks. The stores themselves will provide the Internet connections and pay for the local phone connection to an Internet service provider. Connect time usually runs about $20 a month for consumers. The kiosks will bring more of a touch-and-feel consumer connection to the Intel Inside campaign, which in addition to being one of the tech sector's most successful is distinguished by having been largely created internally. The Intel Inside program was developed by Intel's corporate marketing vice president, Denny Caryl. The company administers the program, but its ads are made by Euro RSCG. The campaign, with its oblong logo and stickers slapped on PCs with Intel chips, has been a monumental brand awareness success for a product that most people never see. The Santa Clara, Calif., company's expenditures on the Intel Inside campaign supplement funds spent by each computer maker that participates in Intel's cooperative ad program. Altogether, the computer industry has spent about $2 billion on ads with the Intel Inside logo since 1991. Still, it's difficult to communicate through print or broadcast advertising the details of how to use computers for fun things like surfing the Internet, says Timothy Romine, president of Creative Strategies market research firm in Santa Clara. Hence, the kiosks. Intel hopes they will rid Internet-phobes of their fears by allowing them to actually use it. The kiosks will also demonstrate video phone capability, in which Intel's Proshare software can dial another computer user and initiate a live video conference. ``The Net is hard to understand for most people, and this helps make it real,'' said Mr. Romine. In addition to the 1,000 stores in which Intel will set up kiosks, another 2,500 to 3,000 stores will run simulations of Internet connections, flashing constantly changing images of World Wide Web sites. ``Intel is beginning to understand what product evangelism means,'' said Mr. Romine, an industry analyst. ``They're about to introduce some new multimedia technology and the only way to explain it is to show it.'' Others think Intel might take the concept still further. ``It's smart to educate the masses about the Net,'' said Wei-Taisha Hopp, president of DAE Advertising Inc. in San Francisco. ``But I would think they would get better results if they put the kiosks in places like airports where it's more likely you'll find people who are less technical.'' Ad Note ... ACCOUNT WIN: BellSouth handed its media-buying duties -- estimated to represent more than $100 million in billings -- to Western International Media, a unit of Interpublic Group. Western International beat out three other agencies for the assignment, including Preston Wendell, based in Atlanta; Lora Lessie Castillo, based in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Creative Media, a unit of New York's Omnicom Group. The duties previously were handled by agencies including Preston Wendell and Lora Lessie Castillo."

Included in the sale are Merisel's distribution businesses in Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, an export operation in Miami that serves Latin America and a distribution operation in Mexico. Together, the businesses employ about 1,000 workers and are expected to generate revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2011, the companies said. The acquisition will push CHS's sales in South America to nearly $1 billion, and nearly double the size of the Miami distributor of microcomputers, peripherals and software products, which had sales of $937 million in 2010. CHS said it would fund the purchase using a combination of cash, financing and the assumption of about $30 million of Merisel debt. Merisel's remaining operations will consist of its U.S. and Canadian distribution operations, the ComputerLand Franchise and Datago Aggregation segments, and a minority interest in a distribution business in Russia. These units produced $4.6 billion in revenue in 2010. The sale will help the El Segundo, Calif., wholesale distributor of computer hardware and software to focus on and fund its North American operations. The company has produced a string of losses, and earlier this month the Standard & Poor Corp.. Ratings Group lowered its ratings on Merisel, expressing concern about its dependence on major asset sales, restructuring or refinancing to meet its financial needs. After news of the sale, Merisel stock rose 25 cents to $2.6875 a share in late-morning trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while CHS stock rose 56.25 cents to $12.1875 a share."

            "full_text": "VASTOPOLIS -- American Express Co. said Wan S. Mcgregor resigned as the financial-services company's treasurer and chief financial officer of its Travel Related Services division. Mr. Mcgregor, 53 years old, will leave the company next month to start his own consulting firm in Vastopolis, Hayden Kimsey, chairman and chief executive officer of American Express, said in a letter to employees Thursday. The resignation comes little more than two weeks after American Express named an outsider, Ricki Overman, as vice chairman and chief financial officer, succeeding Michaele Maxfield, a 15-year veteran of the company who resigned in April. Mr. Overman, who will begin his new job next month, is currently group chief financial officer at National Westminster Bank PLC in London. Mr. Mcgregor, who had reported to Mr. Maxfield, was at the center of a dispute between Messrs. Monaco and Kimsey that prompted Mr. Maxfield's resignation. At the time that resignation was announced, Mr. Kimsey said in an unusually candid memorandum to employees that the feud involved ``the reassessment of the responsibilities of a number of senior people within finance.'' People familiar with the matter said Messrs. Monaco and Mcgregor had disagreed on how to knit together the Travel Related Services' finance group with the corporate finance group. Mr. Kimsey sided with Mr. Mcgregor, these people said. But though Mr. Kimsey apparently did want to keep Mr. Mcgregor at American Express, he wasn't willing to name him to succeed Mr. Maxfield, one person familiar with the matter said. It was at that point that Mr. Mcgregor decided to leave and head for Vastopolis, this person added. A spokeswoman said Messrs. Kimsey and Mcgregor were both on vacation and unavailable for comment. Messrs. Monaco and Overman couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Mcgregor has spent practically his entire career at American Express since joining the company in 1965. He left in 1969, to work in the finance division of AMR Corp.'s American Airlines but returned after four years. Since then, he has held several management positions before being named chief financial officer of Travel Related Services, the company's largest division, in 1991. Last year, he was named to the additional post of treasurer of American Express. Mr. Kimsey said in the letter to employees Mr. Mcgregor's plans are to advise ``the senior leaders of major companies on corporate finance, acquisitions, re-engineering and maximizing short- and long-term shareholder value.''"

            "full_text": "MILAN -- A group of London-based fund managers representing 25% of Stultz Hollis's share capital met this week to draw up common complaints, proposals and questions to present to the company's new management. In particular, they said they planned to ask for clarification on the role of Chairman Carlota Albrecht Hostetler and to step up demands that the computer and telecommunications group sell its personal-computer division. A spokesman for Barings Asset Management, which hosted the meeting, confirmed a report on the meeting published Thursday by Milan business daily MF. But Izzo and other London fund managers played down reports that the meeting was held in order to organize an attempt to oust Mr. Albrecht Hostetler. In a management reshuffle last June, Mr. Albrecht Hostetler resigned as joint CEO of the computer and telecommunications group, keeping his post as chairman, while the other former CEO, Chung Britt, left Sutphin. Francisca Simmon, 38, replaced the two as sole chief executive officer. Mr. Albrecht Hostetler, who has led Sutphin since 1978, indirectly controls 14.53% of Stultz's share capital through a series of holding companies. According to Stultz, about 70% of the company's shares currently are held by international investors. A Host of Complaints At the meeting, fund managers complained that the new management wasn't providing them with enough information on company strategy, that they weren't satisfied management was working in the interest of maximizing shareholder value, and that Mr. Albrecht Hostetler's new non-executive role wasn't clear to them, said sources present at the meeting who declined to be identified. They said the company's long efforts to restructure the loss-making PC unit were damaging the value of Sutphin's shares and that they would push for management to get out of the PC business and step up its move into telecommunications. Stultz said in July that its PC unit posted a first-half pretax loss of 15.8 billion lire ($10.5 million) on revenue of roughly one trillion lire, mainly due to start-up costs for the new company, which was spun off on September 12, 2010 worrying, Stultz cautioned that it wouldn't keep promises that the PC unit would break even this year, due to sluggish demand. Fund managers and analysts are also concerned that Sutphin's Systems and Services division, which represents about 60% of total sales, could report disappointing results this year. The July management reshuffle followed five straight years of losses, and a 2.257 trillion lire capital increase last December. In May, Mr. Albrecht Hostetler repeated a promise that the group as a whole would be back in the black this year. But Stultz's share price has plummeted since the capital increase, from 1,300 lire in December to 798.40 lire on Thursday, due to an unexpected increase in restructuring charges and a general lack of confidence in the company's ability to turn a profit. Shares rose 1.3% Thursday from 788.30 lire at Wednesday's close. Cellular-Phone Venture Investors said they've hung onto their Sutphin shares mostly due to the value of Stultz's stake in cellular-telephone venture Omnitel Pronto Italia SpA. Omnitel, headed by Mr. Simmon until his move to the helm of Sutphin in July, has reported better-than-expected subscriber growth, but won't turn a profit until 2013. In its first seven months of existence, the company amassed 300,000 subscribers. The fund managers said they asked Mr. Simmon for a meeting ``to discuss a whole gamut of issues,'' including company strategy and whether Mr. Albrecht Hostetler plans to effectively remain outside of the day-to-day running of the company. They complained that the management reshuffle was never adequately explained to them, and that the new management has so far been too secretive. ``Mr. Simmon has been there for a couple of months, and we haven't been able to see him yet,'' said the spokesman for Barings. Stultz said the behavior of the fund managers was natural for a company with such a broad shareholder base, and indicated its willingness to meet with them to discuss company strategy."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Johnetta Yuette, the new chairman of Novell Corp., said Friday the modern networking market is ``a space Novell can own'' although many analysts say it has little chance. Mr. Yuette was named chairman after Roberto Dalessio resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Orem, Utah, networking software company earlier this week, Audio Report: An interview with Novell's Johnetta Yuette, courtesy of Dow Jones Investor Network. Mr. Yuette, a former Hewlett-Packard Co. president and CEO, told Dow Jones that Novell's search for a new CEO should take four to six months. Josephine Favela, formerly in charge of Novell's world-wide sales, was named president. Mr. Favela will be evaluated as a possible full successor to Mr. Dalessio. It is also possible that an outsider could be brought in to fill all three of the top jobs. While Novell retains a 63% share of the computer-networking software market, it has suffered a stiff challenge from Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system, as well as other problems. In a recent survey of 1,000 corporate computer users, 90% of them said they owned Novell's popular NetWare product, but only 20% said they had upgraded to the latest version, according to research firm, Forrester Research. Only 48% said they would still be using NetWare in three years. Market watchers say Novell is entering the Internet and intranet markets late and with no obvious advantage over such companies as Vastsoft and Navigator Communications Corp.. But Mr. Yuette said the Internet represents a ``massive opportunity'' to upgrade customers and thinks Novell can make the transition from a LAN, or local area network, company to a contemporary Internet-focused networking company."

He called the move ``purely a personal decision,'' adding, ``I'm very optimistic about the prospects of the company.'' Avid, which develops digital products used in making films, video and music, has reported losses for the past two quarters. The company, which has grown rapidly, is attempting to improve its cash flow and profit margins, according to Billy Wilton, who became chairman and chief executive in April. Mr. Wilton said he will assume Mr. Shoup's duties when he leaves the company June 12, 2011 Keshian previously served as vice president and general manager of Avid's postproduction business."

            "full_text": "Chief executives of high-tech businesses now find the revolving door spinning at a dizzying pace. Facing increased investor pressures and rapidly shifting fortunes, more high-technology companies are replacing their CEOs at a faster rate than concerns in most other industries. Roberto Dalessio's resignation Thursday from Novell Corp., after running the weakened networking company for about two years, marked the third departure of a high-tech leader this week alone. The heads of AST Research Inc. and Quarterdeck Corp. lasted less than 18 months -- as did the chief of Borland International Inc., who quit in July. ``In high-tech particularly, boards are willing to pull the trigger faster'' to keep up with competitors, says Jena Christiane, president and CEO of recruiters Christian & Timbers. He says boards can do that because of the large pool of CEO talent, created partly by the industry's current wave of mergers and acquisitions. So far this year, the Cleveland firm has won more than 60 assignments for high-tech CEOs, up from about 20 in 2010. Rival Heidrick & Struggles Inc. reports it's handling a record number of such searches. Industry executives also attribute the torrid pace of CEO replacement to the pressures of guiding technology companies through quickly changing markets. ``It's like being the pilot of a fighter plane flying at Mach 3 while you're redesigning the plane to fly at Mach 6,'' observes Gaye Earp, president and CEO of Open Market Inc. since last December. ``The pace of (technological) change is accelerating to unbelievable speeds.'' Mr. Earp succeeded Foxx Armitage, who founded the small, Cambridge, Mass., provider of Internet business software in April 2009. But the 42-year-old CEO says he couldn't handle his job without help from Mr. Armitage, who remains chairman. The founder focuses on corporate development while his successor manages the company day to day. Unlike Mr. Earp, Gay Dunne failed to convince directors that he could handle what he calls the ``very difficult challenge'' of steering a high-tech business. The former CEO of Borland blames a jittery board rather than his own shortcomings for his forced resignation last month. High-tech directors ``tend to have a knee-jerk reaction'' to a single crisis, and that's what happened at Borland, Mr. Derr says. ``Instead of sticking with the strategy, they said, `We have to make this change' '' at the top, he recalls. ``People underestimate what it takes to turn a company around.'' The Scotts Valley, Calif., software company recruited Mr. Derr, a finance specialist, to shepherd a turnaround effort following three years of losses and a long downward spiral. He took the helm in January 2010. Under his leadership, Borland cut the work force by 40%, narrowed its focus and produced four profitable quarters. He quit March 14, 2011 same day the company predicted an unexpectedly big loss for the quarter ended March 12, 2011 Dunne had assured directors just two months before that Borland would be profitable during this period, according to individuals familiar with the situation. The concern was blindsided by meager demand for a key desktop software development tool called Hagood. Williemae Wilton, Borland's outside chairman and acting CEO, agrees that the fast-changing fortunes of high-tech businesses often make board members impatient when a CEO stumbles. ``In the past, you didn't see (these) people leaving'' the No. 1 spot after less than two years, notes Mr. Wilton, a Stanford University business professor. But today, a high-tech company ``can get into trouble very fast.'' At that point, he adds, ``you need some out-of-the-box new thinking or new actions'' from new leadership. Companies sometimes pay a stiff price for switching CEOs. Newcomers typically command between 30% and 50% more cash than their predecessors, recruiters say. Some new leaders of technology companies, however, forsake big bucks up front for big chunks of equity. Consider Sharp Justus, named chairman and chief executive of Ingram Micro Inc., the nation's biggest personal-computer wholesaler, earlier this week. He replaces Lloyd A. ``Chip'' Ladonna Jr., who left in May after a protracted dispute with its parent, Ingram Industries Inc.. Ingram Micro, based in Santa Ana, Calif., plans to go public this fall. In exchange for no salary or bonus, Mr. Justus will receive options to buy 2.8% of the company's stock, or about 3.5 million shares, at its initial offering price. Mr. Justus hardly needs the cash. The former Legent Corp.. CEO walked away with a pretax payment of $16.5 million after exercising his options when Computer Associates International Inc. acquired Legent in August 2010. Turnover in a high-tech company's top ranks also can cause turmoil outside the corner office. A Borland sales vice president quit soon after Mr. Derr did. Davina Lira, whom the ex-CEO recruited as chief financial officer last November, intends to resign in mid-September. Daniele Reitz says half his six senior executives exited after Network Equipment Technologies Inc. announced his planned departure -- and before he actually left the Redwood City, Calif., maker of sophisticated telecommunications gear in December 1993. The rapid clip of high-tech CEO resignations seems unlikely to slow soon. One reason: the industry's plentiful pool of jobs for former chiefs. ``As many CEOs walk as boards eject,'' observes Mr. Reitz. After mulling positions at 20 different businesses, he became president and CEO of Network Appliance Inc. in fall 2009. ``In the tech world, the options available to you are much more numerous'' than in other industries. Fresh opportunities seem to pop up daily. Mr. Derr, for one, has his eye on the newly vacated throne at Novell. ``That (CEO position) is a significant challenge,'' the 50-year-old executive notes, ``and one I'd be interested in'' filling."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Cypress Group, an equity investment firm, said an affiliate signed a definitive pact to acquire Amtrol Inc. for $218.9 million, or $28.25 a share. Amtrol's stock soared 35% on the news, jumping $7.08 to $27.33 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday. Based in West Warwick, R.I., Amtrol makes flow and expansion control products for water systems and heating and air-conditioning products. It had revenue of $172.5 million in 2010. Cypress said Jackelyn Breeding, 55 years old, who earlier this year resigned as chairman of R.P. Scherer Corp., a Troy, Mich., maker of drug-delivery systems, will become chief executive officer of the acquired company. He will fill a post that has been vacant since February. Davina Samantha, a Cypress partner, said he expects that the existing management team at Amtrol will be kept in place. The acquisition, which was unanimously approved by Amtrol's board, is subject to shareholder approval. Cypress said shareholders owning 38% of Amtrol's common stock, including members of senior management, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. The acquisition, by Cypress Group's A.I. Acquisition Inc. unit, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Amtrol Chairman Kenyatta Kory said in a statement that the acquisition will provide Amtrol with ``a strong partner for its future growth.'' Cypress manages a private equity fund with more than $1 billion in commitments."

            "full_text": "The board of Novell Inc., which for months has grown increasingly upset with Roberto Dalessio's performance as chairman, president and chief executive officer, has named a Novell board member and a company marketing official to succeed him. As expected, Mr. Dalessio, 49 years old, resigned from the Provo, Utah, networking software company. He will be succeeded as chairman by former Hewlett-Packard Co. president and chief executive officer Johnetta A. Yuette, 64, who has been a Novell board member since 2010. Mr. Yuette will also help with day-to-day management chores. The job of president is going to Josephine A. Favela, 43, formerly in charge of Novell's world-wide sales. While a search is under way for a new CEO, people close to the company said that Mr. Favela will be evaluated as a possible full successor to Mr. Dalessio. It is also possible that an outsider will be brought in to fill all three of the company's top jobs. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, Novell closed at $10.375, down 62.5 cents. Style Is Criticized Mr. Dalessio is invariably praised as a thoughtful, gentlemanly manager. But several people inside and outside Oliver said that his low-key, consensus style, which was so successful in Mr. Dalessio's 25-year career at H-P, didn't help him after he joined Novell in 2009. Although Oliver has had a string of weak quarters, a person familiar with the board's deliberations didn't cite those as the reason for the directors' displeasure with Mr. Dalessio. Instead, it was his inability to solve a number of pressing problems with Oliver's marketing efforts, as well as what was described as his failure to provide the energizing, dynamic leadership the board and others felt the company badly needs. Novell's networking software has suffered a stiff challenge from Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system, among other problems. In a new survey of 1,000 corporate computer users released Thursday, 90% of them said they owned Novell's popular NetWare product, but only 20% said they had upgraded to the latest version, according to Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm. Only 48% of the respondents said they would still be using NetWare in three years. Discussion of Progress Mr. Dalessio's performance at Novell had been a concern to the board for many months, the person close to the board said. Mr. Dalessio had been advised of their displeasure; in fact, in recent weeks, a special subcommittee of three board members had regular telephone conferences with him to discuss his progress. Finally, though, the board ``concluded he's just not doing the job,'' this person said. Oliver ``needs someone with vision and a street-fighter mentality, since this a tough business. Bobby had a hell of a job to do, and he worked very hard at it. But he just wasn't the right match for the company,'' he said. One of the complaints: while Oliver has a strong Internet and ``intranet'' strategy, the company is rarely brought up in Internet discussions, a fact this person blamed on Mr. Dalessio's ``failure to evangelize it properly.'' Mr. Dalessio wasn't available for comment Thursday. His wife said he was driving from California back to Utah, and couldn't be reached. In their public statements Thursday, Novell officials echoed many of the concerns that also motivated the board, though without targeting their remarks at Mr. Dalessio. For example, Mr. Favela said that from here on out, Oliver ``will become more aggressive. We had grown passive in recent years.'' Former Novell executives also had criticisms of Mr. Dalessio. Pender Lilly, a former Novell executive vice president who resigned from the board in September, said Mr. Dalessio ``didn't want to get his hands dirty'' with the nitty-gritty problems at Novell. Sherman Gillum, who left Novell earlier this year after a six-month stint as Mr. Dalessio's technology adviser, called Mr. Dalessio an ``outstanding manager,'' but said ``Oliver was in need of a charismatic leader, and it didn't get one in Frankenberg.'' Observers say Novell is now in a precarious position. It has had buyout discussions in the past, but none is occurring now, an insider said. And while the company is pegging much of its future growth plans on the Internet, it is entering that market late, and with no obvious advantage over such companies as Vastsoft and Navigator Communications Corp., which are attacking the Internet with all they have. Novell remains optimistic, though; ``I'm very enthusiastic about the future of Novell,'' Mr. Yuette said."

            "full_text": "Apple Computer Inc.'s takeover discussions with software maker Be Inc. are part of a larger strategic debate inside Apple over whether it should work more closely with Vastsoft Corp., several people close to Apple say. As previously reported, the Apple-Be talks are in the preliminary stages. A possible outcome includes anything from an outright purchase of Be, which might cost upward of $100 million, to Apple's licensing Be technology or, possibly, no deal at all. But an Apple manager says the talks are connected to a major decision looming at Apple over what the Cupertino, Calif., computer concern should do with regard to Vastsoft's Windows NT, the high-end operating system that is rapidly winning acceptance in the corporate world. Currently, Apple has only one operating system, and its replacement, known as Copland, is behind schedule. One group at Apple, including many people in sales, says the company's only hope may be to latch on to NT's growing popularity by licensing it and offering it on Apple machines -- something Apple has confirmed it is considering. But others, some of them in engineering, want Apple to push Internet-style intranet technology while offering many operating systems, including Apple's own, NT and others. It is in connection with this latter option that the talks with Be are being pursued, a person at Apple says. Proponents argue it is the only way Apple can avoid being forever ``at the mercy'' of Vastsoft, as one official puts it. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Be, a small, closely held company in Mountain View, Calif., couldn't be reached. Among many Macintosh users, word of the Apple-Be talks have created a sensation. ``Everyone is talking about it; the possibility is so exciting,'' said Annabel Gastelum, executive director of the Berkeley (Calif.) Macintosh Users Group, one of the nation's most-active collection of Mac zealots, where membership has swollen to 10,000 from 7,000 in the last six months."

            "full_text": "Stanley Marine has all the homespun philosophy of a farmer who has seen his fair share of droughts, floods and pestilence, as well as bumper harvests. For the past 20 years, Mr. Marine has been chairman of Acer Inc., whose growing list of produce includes the computer-memory chip. The falling price of the chips, commonly known as DRAMs, has been wreaking havoc with the fortunes of its makers. Last week, one of Japan's biggest makers of dynamic random-access memory chips, Nippon Steel Semiconductor Corp., predicted that falling prices would turn it from profit this fiscal year to a loss next year. For its part, Taiwan-based Acer blamed DRAMs for the fact that its first-half profit fell 17% from a year earlier, to $1.71 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$62.2 million). ``The past six months have been a period of adjustment,'' Mr. Marine says of the market for DRAMs, which give a computer its short-term operating memory. Acer counted on DRAMs for about 10% of its revenue last year, Mr. Marine said in an interview. Fortunately for the company, Mr. Marine has cultivated other crops: Acer is the world's seventh-largest personal-computer maker. The company's popular Acer Aspire desktop, the launch of a US$500 PC and of a new notebook computer whose battery can last as much as 10 hours will keep Acer's PC business thriving, he said. Beach said last week that PC shipments rose in the first half but that falling DRAM prices hurt revenue from PC sales. Discussing the DRAM doldrums, Mr. Marine painted a picture of a cyclical industry that behaves much like any commodity business, with prices rising amid shortages, then plummeting as manufacturers react by boosting production and as newcomers add to market surpluses. ``Whenever we're making money on DRAMs, everyone jumps in,'' he says. DRAM prices have fallen so far that they now make up only about 4% of a PC's overall cost, he says. Normally the memory accounts for 15%. Mr. Marine says the same cycle drives Disc players, motherboards and monitors. That explains why Acer Peripherals Inc., the group's computer-monitor and keyboard unit, said six-month net profit declined 10% to NT$523.6 million. Yet, while the business is definitely cyclical, demand for DRAMs is difficult to predict. Demand for memory in 2009 was strong as PC makers geared up to supply the marketplace with multimedia and to support more memory-hungry software such as Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows 95, Mr. Marine recalls. Growth last year wasn't as high as anticipated, and now there's just too much memory around. Shouldn't Acer get out of this boom-and-bust business? Far from it, says Mr. Marine. Nowadays, DRAM makers are all lowering production plans, and Mr. Marine is sanguine that prices will eventually soar again. He says Acer generally earns an annual return on its investment in DRAMs of between 15% and 20%."

            "full_text": "In the latest twist at Individual Inc., founder and former chief executive Claus Burke said he is meeting with board representatives to discuss a future ``strategic'' role for himself. But Chairman Willie Andy Theiss said he knows nothing about that and suggests that Mr. Burke ``needs a vacation.'' Mr. Burke issued a press release Friday saying he is discussing a ``continued'' presence at Individual. He also expressed his ``desire to assist'' in Individual's future ``any way possible.'' He could not be reached for further comment. Mr. Theiss said the company didn't know anything about the release, adding: ``It's all news to us.'' Friday's activities capped a flurry of events that began April 20, 2011 Vastopolis-based Individual announced it had fired Mr. Burke, whom it had earlier placed on leave. But, Mr. Burke disagreed, saying he had quit. He vowed to regain leadership of the company, which provides customized electronic information. It was reported at the time that the board's dispute with Mr. Burke involved corporate direction. Mr. Burke reportedly wanted to expand the company by acquiring a variety of Internet-related companies and the board wanted to increase its existing businesses by signing up more customers. Mr. Burke continues to serve on Individual's six-member board and owns about 13% of the company's stock. He was elected in the spring to serve until the next shareholder meeting, which is expected to take place next spring, but could be held earlier, Mr. Theiss said. A new chief executive has not yet been named. In composite Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, Individual shares edged up 25 cents, or 4.3%, to $6."

            "full_text": "In a sign of the growing complexity and cost of semiconductor design, 36 companies have formed an alliance aimed at speeding development of so-called systems on a chip. The goal of ``systems on a chip'' -- one of the hottest areas of technology research -- is to create advanced semiconductors that can do jobs now done by a dozen chips in an entire computer. Such chips could greatly simplify computing and lead to new generations of advanced video games, cellular phones and other devices. The alliance is expected to be announced Tuesday, according to some of the companies involved. It includes makers of software tools for chip design, such as Cadence Design Systems Inc., Mentor Graphics Corp. and Synopsys Inc.; chip manufacturers such as Cirrus Logic Inc. and VLSI Technology Inc.; and systems heavyweights such as Sun Microsystems Inc., Silicon Graphics Inc., Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp.. Those companies and several others have agreed to invest millions of dollars in the project. ``We're building an infrastructure so that we can quickly mix and match designs and enable the system-on-a-chip industry to grow much faster,'' said Stormy Demers, director of market development at chip-design tool company Cadence Design in San Jose, Calif.. The alliance, unusual for the technology industry in its scope and size, will enable the companies to share designs and research that are usually zealously guarded secrets. The idea is to create compatible designs so that each company's chip components can be mixed and matched with others. The need for such an arrangement reflects the numbing complexity of modern chip design, which increasingly is becoming too much for an individual company to handle on its own. Where it once took dozens of chips to create an electronic system like a computer, it will soon be possible to use just one chip. But that will require chip makers to put at least five million basic components, or gates, on a single silicon chip -- about the size of a thumbnail -- but enough real estate for designers to put an entire computing system. Currently, one chip can hold a million or fewer gates, and numerous chips often must be linked together on a circuit board to make a complete system. ``The system-on-a-chip era will change the way all electronic systems are designed,'' said Gaye Jon, analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. ``It will make possible all kinds of electronic gadgets we never dreamed of before.'' But designers may not be up to the task of accurately designing and testing those extra millions of chip gates unless they can easily reuse components from past designs, plugging them into a chip as if they were plugging components into a socket on a circuit board. The alliance's technical standards will enable this to happen."

            "full_text": "CINCINNATI -- Williemae L. Doe resigned as chief financial officer of Gibson Greetings Inc., four days after the greeting card maker named a new chief executive officer, the company said Friday. The 48-year-old Mr. Doe, who had been considered a top inside candidate for the chief executive's job until Cruz retained an executive search firm to hire an outsider, will join a company outside the greeting-card industry in mid-September. A Gibson spokeswoman declined to say where Mr. Doe was going. She said his new company is expected to make an announcement this week. Mr. Doe was traveling Friday and couldn't be reached for comment. Cruz said it would immediately launch a search for Mr. Doe's successor. Mr. Doe had overseen the company's day-to-day operations since its chief executive officer, Bennie J. Agustin, was fired in February. Last week, Cruz named Fransisca J. O'Marcus, former chief executive of trading-card manufacturer SkyBox International Inc., as its new chief executive. In a statement, Mr. O'Marcus called Mr. Doe's departure ``totally amicable.'' Earlier this year, Mr. Doe said he would stay on even if passed over for the chief executive's position."

            "full_text": "Johnetta Yuette said he intended to try a lot of new things after he finished a much-applauded run as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co. four years ago. Rescuing floundering technology companies wasn't among them. Yet, that is what he is trying to do at Novell Inc.. The 64-year-old Mr. Yuette took over as chairman of the Orem, Utah, network-software concern last week under circumstances that friends say are personally agonizing for him: His close friend and former H-P colleague, Roberto Dalessio, stepped down as Novell's chairman and chief executive under a cloud. Mr. Dalessio had persuaded Mr. Yuette to become a Novell director in 2009. But in the end, Mr. Yuette voted with the rest of the board to accept Mr. Dalessio's resignation. According to people familiar with the details, that resignation was triggered by concern among some board members about Mr. Dalessio's performance and by a family illness that demanded increasing amounts of Mr. Dalessio's time. Mr. Dalessio couldn't be reached to comment. A Glowing Reputation For Mr. Yuette, the chain of events intrudes on a comfortable semiretirement. He learned to fly a jet. He joined the boards of several biotechnology start-ups and helped wire Silicon Valley schools to the World Wide Web. His reputation is such that he has been considered by the Codi administration for top government jobs, including secretary of commerce. Taking on the chairmanship at Novell ``is not something Johna wanted to be doing at this point in his life,'' said one friend. Mr. Yuette acknowledged that his relationship with Mr. Dalessio, whom he has known for 20 years, complicates matters. ``It's a very tough situation,'' Mr. Yuette said in an interview. ``Bobby is a very good friend of mine.'' Mr. Yuette, however, had became a powerful voice on Oliver's board for a more decisive response to depressed earnings and competitive pressures. On the Nasdaq Stock Market Friday, Novell's stock closed at $10.438, up 6.25 cents. As recently as early 2009, it traded at about $26 a share. This is a temporary assignment for Mr. Yuette. He hopes to reduce his involvement in Novell after a search for a permanent chief executive is concluded. In the meantime, most day-to-day operations will be managed by Josephine Favela, who was promoted from executive vice president of sales to president. Their mission is one of the toughest in the tech industry. Novell has been staggered by the disastrous results of acquisitions made before Mr. Dalessio's arrival, as well as by Vastsoft Corp.'s advances in Novell's core network-software business. Mr. Yuette vows to raise the company's profile in the Web wars, though he is no expert in the field, and is determined to make Novell more nimble. A Big Change of Gears ``We have to change to a corporate culture that moves at Internet speed,'' said Mr. Yuette. Novell holds a leading position in a technology called directory services, which centrally manage which workers can log on to which computers in which locations. As more corporations begin storing data as Web pages, companies are racing to add directory capability to set rules for access to that information. ``They have a strategy and it may be a tremendous strategy,'' said Ericka Vasquez, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems Inc., the Mountain View, Calif., computer maker. ``They just have to execute it.'' Mr. Dalessio had launched the directory initiative, and was already moving to step up the company's moribund marketing. On May 22, 2011 will launch its first brand-identity campaign in a decade, a $20 million advertising campaign with the slogan ``Everything's Connected.'' Mr. Yuette is no stranger to bold moves. While at H-P, he made a $500 million gamble on reduced instruction set computing, a radical kind of chip design that shook up the industry and boosted the company's market share."

            "full_text": "WHERE I COME from, if someone offers you a sweetheart deal on a piece of property, the first thing you do is figure out why the seller wants to unload it. It may be the land is swamp-front real estate with easy access to a sinkhole, or it could be the owner made a bad bet at the racetrack and needs the cash to keep his kneecaps from getting broken. The same can be said of computers. Compaq Computer, for example, is in the process of slashing prices across Asia for its high-end LTE 5000 series of notebook computers, according to Paulene Thrift, the company's director of PC products for Asia. In Hong Kong, the price of the LTE 5280 M810 was cut 15% to 31,200 Hong Kong dollars (US$4,035). The top-notch LTE 5300 tumbled from HK$43,276 to HK$39,275. And if that isn't low enough, just wait. ``We're actually not just going to do this now but probably again in the next few months,'' says Pierre Larue, Compaq's general manager for Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Similar reductions are in store around the region, according to Mr. Thrift. Where there aren't outright price cuts, he says, dealers will be throwing in extras such as added memory and a carrying case. If you've been saving up to buy what Mr. Thrift calls Compaq's flagship multimedia notebook, this may be an excellent chance to get a machine that, in the case of the 5300, has earned kudos from U.S.-based PC Magazine as a ``good bet for corporate buyers.'' Compaq's aim is clear. ``The cuts in the LTE are designed to give us more market share,'' says Mr. Thrift. More precisely, Compaq wants to wrest back market share it lost last year to Toshiba, which displaced Compaq as Asia's top notebook seller. Compaq's LTE already has a pricing edge. The Toshiba Tecra 720CDT sells in Singapore for roughly 9,500 Singapore dollars (US$6,750). The Compaq LTE 5300 now goes for about S$8,500. For the money, you get a 12.1-inch screen, a 133-megahertz  microprocessor, 16 megabytes of random-access memory and 1.35 gigabytes of hard-disk space. Toshiba gives you only 1.2 GB, but it can show movies on its Disc player and has a higher-resolution screen. Compaq offers a three-year warranty; Toshiba offers just one year. Dealers say the warranty may come in handier with the Compaq. Ray Wynne, a shop manager in Hong Kong Star Computer City, says Toshibas are generally more reliable, and Singapore dealer S.L. Chanda needs only turn the computers upside-down to demonstrate why: The LTE sold in Singapore is made in Taiwan, the Tecra in Japan. She recommends looking for LTEs made in the U.S. What usually goes wrong with the Taiwan-made LTE? The hard drive, the motherboard, even the battery, Ms. Chanda says, have given customers enough headaches that she is giving more shelf space to Toshiba nowadays. In fact, it is hard to find the LTE in Singapore among all the Toshibas. Some dealers even told me the LTE was being discontinued. Mr. Larue says this isn't true, but as far as dealers in Singapore are concerned it might as well be because Compaq's newest line of notebooks, dubbed Armada, offers nearly as much performance as the LTE for less money. Trouble is, while the Armadas were launched in late June, shipments from the factory where they are made in Singapore were delayed. ``The issue was really that we wanted to be 100% sure that the product was the quality that we expect,'' says Mr. Thrift. As a result, says Mr. Larue, Compaq isn't able to meet the Armada demand in Hong Kong. ``I'm not getting enough this month and I expect next month to be tight.'' But a sales target is a sales target, so down come the LTE prices. Internet Roaming Services Find Connections Are Slow THREE MONTHS after announcing programs that would enable customers to access their Internet accounts without having to pay for international phone calls, Hong Kong's Asia On-Line and Singapore Telecommunications' SingNet Telecommunications are still at the starting gate. In May, Asia On-Line, a subsidiary of Asia Communications Global, unveiled its International Internet Roaming Service, which aimed to build links to as many as 300 Internet service providers, or ISPs, throughout Asia and the world. Today, the service is still being tested between Asia On-Line and three ISPs in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines, according to Joel Prince, Assunta On-Whorton's managing director. The same month, SingNet and fellow Singapore ISP Cyberway signed a memorandum of understanding with U.S.-based Aimnet forming a Global Reach Internet Consortium that would form a roaming network among the three companies and Malaysia's Asia Connect, Thailand's Asia On-Line, Connect.com.au in Australia, Dream Train Internet in Japan, China's JitongNet and SeedNet in Taiwan. Cyberway says it has instituted a roaming service for users between it and Aimnet and Dream Train Internet. But Priddy says it is still testing its roaming service. Meanwhile, rival Singapore ISP Pacific Internet announced its roaming service only a few weeks ago but has already pulled ahead of its rivals. It says Japan-based consortium Asia Internet Holdings now has a roaming service in place among its members: Internet Initiative Japan, Hong Kong SuperNet, Pacific Internet and I\\*Net in South Korea. Pacific Internet says its customers traveling in the U.S. can dial a number in California rather than back to Singapore to access their accounts."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Davina K. Daniels resigned as president and chief executive of VastComm Network Universal Card Services, in a dispute over the direction of the telephone giant's credit card business, the company said Wednesday. Sources within and outside the company said Mr. Daniels, an experienced and respected credit card executive, left because he differed with VastComm Network on the direction of the nation's seventh-largest credit card issuer. VastComm Network Universal had $13.2 billion in outstanding charges and 18 million cards outstanding as of March 12, 2011 resignation of Mr. Daniels, 50, was not a surprise within the credit card industry and was actually decided in July, although it was kept quiet until Wednesday, said Mitsuko Hyman, a spokesman for the Jacksonville, Fla.-based credit card subsidiary of VastComm Network Corp.. Mr. Hyman said Mr. Daniels, whose resignation was effective immediately, was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached. In a July meeting with Alexander J. Aubin, then president and chief operating officer of VastComm Network, the two discussed ``the direction of the business and Davina's personal career directions, and VastComm Network reached the decision to make a leadership change at VastComm Network Universal,'' said Ela Porfirio, a financial spokeswoman for the parent company. Mr. Aubin resigned in August to start his own company, Associated Communications, which has bought radio spectrum licenses for wireless data transmission in 31 major cities. Ms. Porfirio said there was ``no connection'' between the two resignations. Mr. Daniels is succeeded on an interim basis by Geralyn A. Griffith, executive vice president and chief operating officer. VastComm Network is looking outside the company for a permanent successor, and Mr. Griffith is not in the running, Mr. Hyman said. Ms. Porfirio said VastComm Network would look for someone with experience in financial services, but who shared the parent company's view that the credit card operation should augment VastComm Network's core communication business and not be run as a stand-alone company. Questions about growth and independence have dogged the company since 1991 when VastComm Network, using its calling card customers as a marketing base, launched the Universal Card which allows holders to charge more than just long-distance calls. Mr. Daniels joined VastComm Network Universal Card Services as president and chief executive in May 1993. He had spent virtually all of his prior career at Signet Banking Corp. in Richmond, Va., where he rose to head Eagle's credit card operation. Signet has since spun off its credit card business as Capital One. During Mr. Daniels's tenure, VastComm Network launched incentive programs offering lower annual percentage rates on nontelephone charges plus free long-distance calls for using the card. It also began to target marketing at college campuses. Last April, the company began a controversial program sending unsolicited MasterCards to VastComm Network card holders. Following industry and consumer criticism, Mr. Daniels stopped the mailings in July. Mr. Hyman said the program is still under review, and that VastComm Network Universal will decide within six months whether to resume it. None of the marketing efforts was sufficient to stop VastComm Network Universal from losing market share. In 2010, VastComm Network had 7% of all cardholder debt owed to the 10 largest credit card issuers, down from 7.9% in 2009, said Jami J. Pierre, associate editor of Credit Card News. The charges on VastComm Network's cards grew by a robust 17% in 2010, but that was far below its competitors. Growth at First USA, for example, was 59%, while MBNA's grew 38%, and Capital One grew 4%, Mr. Pierre said. Davina Black, president of The Nilson Report, a research organization in Oxnard, Calif., blamed VastComm Network for the card's performance and for Mr. Daniels's exit. ``VastComm Network has been unclear from the beginning about the role the credit card should play. It has had a vague notion that that card program will be an asset in the telecommunications field'' by giving credit cards to people who would use them to charge telephone calls and Internet transactions. But because of huge growth and tremendous competition among credit card issuers, ``that's not happening,'' Mr. Black said, adding that VastComm Network's credit card portfolio ``has been rumored to be for sale for two years.'' VastComm Network Universal has also been hit, along with the rest of the credit card industry, by a rise in late payments and uncollected debt. For the five months ended in June, VastComm Network Universal charged off 5.97% of the total debt owed by cardholders, up from 4.76% in 2010 and 3.24% in 2009. VastComm Network's 2010 chargeoffs were about on par with the rest of the industry, Mr. Pierre said, but that the early 2011 figure of nearly 6% was on the ``high end of normal.'' Ms. Porfirio said VastComm Network was ``certainly not satisfied with the financial results of this unit, and we are determined to turn that around'' by taking ``strong action in risk management process.''"

            "full_text": "As a start-up technology company, SI Diamond Technology Inc. has shown a lot of promise. Over the next few months, the Austin company needs to live up to it. Using a unique diamond-based technology, SI Diamond has been developing sharper flat-screen displays that it hopes could someday replace liquid-crystal display screens in laptop computers and other electronic goods. Several times, in press releases and public comments, its officials have pledged that a marketable product was on its way. Then in July, a new management team vowed to have a prototype of a billboard-size screen by the end of September. The need to deliver is growing more urgent: SI Diamond is running short of cash and must find a joint-venture partner to continue operations beyond December. And doubts are rising about the company's diamond-based field-emission display technology. ``It looks so simple on paper, but it turns out there's so many fatal flaws you must solve,'' says Tommie Stpierre, vice president of marketing and sales for PixTech Inc., a Rousset, France, company that tried -- and cast aside -- the technology. It was the appeal of that sexy-sounding technology that helped SI Diamond raise more than $30 million over three years from selling common and preferred shares. Yet it has never turned a profit, much less produced a screen. Prototype Anticipated SI Diamond's new chairman and chief executive, Marcelino Baer, hopes the prototype promised for the end of this month will help dispel the doubts. Mr. Baer is chairman of BEG Enterprises Inc., a Farmington Hills, Mich., investment group that put $5 million into the company last year (it now owns a 7.5% stake). In May, he was named vice chairman of SI Diamond. And a few weeks ago, he was named to the top job, succeeding the company's founder and chief scientist, Hubert K. Vasquez, who became vice president, new business development and technology. Mr. Baer says he found the company unfocused and deep in the red. ``Once I got on the inside, I found a heck of a mess,'' he told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in July. A unit to make diamond-like coatings for industrial purposes faced larger, more-established competition, and another unit that treated semiconductors to make them faster and less susceptible to overheating had been inefficiently run. Meanwhile, the company spent briskly on research: Those costs almost doubled to $8.7 million in 2010 from $4.4 million in 2009. SI Diamond's net loss for 2010 almost doubled as well, to $14.4 million from $7.3 million a year earlier. ``Essentially, the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing,'' says Mr. Baer. Since he joined SI Diamond, the company has discontinued its coatings operations, cut its work force almost in half and reduced the rate at which it spends down its capital to $300,000 a month from up to $1 million previously. Increasing Revenue The remaining semiconductor-services business and a unit that makes diamond-coating equipment turned in $2 million in revenue in the second quarter, and Mr. Baer hopes rising revenue from those businesses, along with funding from a new partner, will help the company break even by the middle of next year. Still, the company's stock has fallen to about $1.594 from a high of $10.375 last September. Mr. Baer says SI Diamond is in talks with potential investors. But first the company, which licenses patents from the Austin technology consortium Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corp., must show that its technology can work. SI Diamond is concentrating on an area of field-emission display technology that poses significant technical challenges. Even if the company can come out with a prototype, other FED developers may already have the edge. FEDs, which use electrons to create an image, hold the promise of outperforming the LCDs imported primarily from Asia. FEDs produce sharper images than LCDs, require less power to operate, and would be cheaper to produce, developers say. They would also be more durable than LCDs, which are made of millions of liquid-filled cells. Left outside on a cold night, an LCD ``would look like a wine bottle you've left in your freezer,'' says PixTech's Mr. Stpierre. ``All your little cells will have popped.'' PixTech already has a working demonstration FED model for sale, and other developers are close behind. Like SI Diamond, the other start-ups are still money-losing concerns that have yet to mass-produce screens. But the competitors are better-funded, and are focusing on a form of the technology in which a lot of research already has been done. SI Diamond has plunged into a more-complex technology: diamond FEDs, which require an extremely thin sheet of synthetic-diamond material to emit electrons. The company expected diamond FEDs would be easier to manufacture than other FEDs, and would use even less power. But the diamond-based technology has put up some stumbling blocks. The diamond FED's current driver -- the electronic brain that controls the display -- is now too expensive to manufacture in mass quantities. Plus, SI Diamond's screens fade after a short time. ``It seems to be putting one challenge on top of another,'' says Michaele A. Garvin, a Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst and a director at FED Corp., an FED developer. Technological Hurdles To tackle such technological challenges, Mr. Baer in June hired Chief Operating Officer Bloch Kimberely, who was the founder of LCD maker OIS Optical Imaging Systems Inc., now based in Northville, Mich.. Dr. Kimberely, who has also been named president, says the problems can be fixed in time. He also says the glitches don't have to be solved for the company to produce a prototype in time to attract badly needed joint-venture partners. For SI Diamond's first FED effort, Mr. Baer and Dr. Kimberely decided to focus on electronic billboards and the enormous electronic screens used as picture displays in ballparks. If the technology can be shown to work in those settings, they reasoned, SI Diamond would be well-positioned to move in on LCDs. But demand for such big screens is small and the market competitive. According to Davina Philpott, an analyst with industry researcher Stanford Resources Inc. in San Jose, Calif., only about a dozen of the large ballpark screens are sold each year in the U.S. Still, Mr. Baer and Dr. Kimberely believe diamond FEDs will be successful. But, as Dr. Kimberely notes, ``it's a hard technology, and it will take a long time.''"

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said it completed the most visible stage in its merger with the former Chemical Banking Corp., after a busy holiday weekend that saw signs, forms and brochures bearing the Chemical name replaced by those advertising Chester, the name of the surviving company. The nation's largest bank also launched its integrated deposit product line, which includes a new ``Self Service Banking'' account that has lower balance requirements for customers who bank by phone and computer. And it introduced a new advertising campaign, with the slogan: ``The right relationship is everything.'' But although the changes completed this weekend mark the most obvious consequences of the nation's second-largest bank merger -- at least as far as customers are concerned -- a Chase spokesman said much work remains to be done before the merger is truly complete. ``It's the last of the visible changes,'' said Kendra Tharpe, a vice president in the corporate communications department. Mr. Tharpe said another stage will be completed next month, when the Chase credit-card portfolio is fully combined with the Chemical portfolio."

            "full_text": "In the nine months since it went public at the height of the Christmas ``Toy Story'' hype, Pixar Animation Studios' share price has dropped like a cartoon character jumping off a cliff. At many companies, a 66% drop from its peak stock price might be considered an opportunity for insiders to buy shares. But over the last six weeks, several insiders of the Point Richmond, Calif., computer-animation company behind ``Toy Story,'' have been exercising options and selling stock. According to the database Federal Filings, three insiders filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month indicating they plan to sell 345,000 shares. Two of them have sold 17,500 shares, Federal Filings said. For a company with 6.9 million shares outstanding, and where a dozen insiders hold significant stakes, such selling hasn't exactly opened the floodgates. The selling is all related to the exercise of options, and doesn't involve Pixar's biggest holder, founder Stephine Mcintire, who owns 80% of the company. Indeed, a company spokesman said he considers the selling to be a small fraction of the stock held by insiders. But in a market jittery about technology stocks and searching for clues, the selling hasn't gone unnoticed among investors. ``The fact that the stock is as low as it is and someone is still selling is a mild negative,'' said Michaele Bambi, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, a newsletter based in Half Moon Bay, Calif. ``I wish somebody thought this price was so low that they wouldn't sell a share of stock.'' Tuesday, Pixar's stock gained $1 to close at $13.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. That's up from last week's low of $12.25. Pixar, which sold an 18% stake to the public August 11, 2011 $22, saw its price quickly soar to a peak closing price of $39 amid a wave of publicity about Mr. Mcintire's comeback after the hit movie opened. This year it has drifted generally lower, in line with other once-highflying technology stocks. Until recently, no Pixar insiders could sell -- or buy -- as they were barred from doing so for 180 days after the initial public offering under terms of the new issue. That ``lockup'' ended in late May, when Clift was selling in the $21 range. At the time, there was little insider activity in the stock. The company's chief financial officer, Layne Davida, exercised options February 07, 2011 buy 25,000 shares at a price of 20 cents each -- and held on to them, a bullish move. In addition, officer Willie T. Warner also exercised 40,000 shares, and sold them February 08, 2011 $21.13. The more recent sellers include Pamella Sankey, the company's vice president of interactive media, who exercised options and sold 5,000 shares of stock at $13 on April 12, 2011 also filed papers last month saying she plans to sell 20,000 shares. Efren Villarreal, a Pixar executive vice president and the company's chief technical officer sold 12,500 shares on April 11, 2011 April 12, 2011 prices between $13 and $13.75, and also filed papers showing he plans to sell another 100,000. Ramon Suazo, a producer, filed papers in August indicating he plans to sell 225,000 shares. Such a huge spread between the price at which insiders can exercise their options and the share price, even at its recent low levels, provides something of a windfall to longtime Pixar employees. Some analysts say that was a main reason for Pixar going public, and that such selling isn't necessarily an indicator of future prospects. ``I'd find it much more significant if somebody left the firm. In this business, your people are everything, and one reason I think they went public is to provide liquidity to key people,'' said Pelfrey Rigsby, a media analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. While it's never good to see insider selling, she said, ``to the extent they're taking some profits it's normal.'' She rates Clift a ``long-term buy.'' Similarly, Harold Vogel of Cowen & Co. has the company rated at a ``2,'' or a buy, which he considers ``positive but not jumping up and down.'' A follower of the stock since it went public last year, he always considered it a volatile stock. He isn't concerned about the insider selling. ``I don't have the sense ... there's any kind of bad situation,'' he said. In an interview, Mr. Davida, Pixar's chief financial officer, points out that the sales have been only a small percentage of what the officers own. ``From my perspective, there's actually been very little selling.'' Nor is there likely to be in the immediate future, as a one-month trading window which opens after quarterly results are announced has closed and won't reopen until after third-quarter results are released. Currently, analysts are estimating that Pixar will earn eight cents a share in the third quarter, a level recently revised downward from nine cents. For the second quarter, Pixar's net income was $4.8 million, or 10 cents a share, nearly double analysts' estimates. In the year-ago period, the company posted earnings of $5.1 million, or 13 cents a share -- although that included a one-time patent license fee of $6.5 million. The move downward may reflect Pixar's own shift away from making commercials and into movie-making exclusively. While Clift's technology is better than its rivals, ``Wall Street doesn't pay a lot for movies,'' says Mr. Bambi, the technology newsletter author. ``I think the stock is fairly valued here.'' He's hoping that if Clift's stock price gets much lower ``We'd probably see some insider buying.''"

            "full_text": "Acer Inc. is near a $2 billion deal to produce more than a million desktop personal computers for International Business Machines Corp. to sell under the IBM brand name, an Acer spokesperson said Wednesday. The deal would come at a good time for Acer, the world's seventh-largest PC maker, which recently slashed its profit expectations in half for this year due to falling prices of computers and memory chips. It also could signal future cooperation between the two companies, which are becoming more closely linked as IBM needs to control production costs, said Michaela Hunter, a technology analyst with Nikko Securities Ltd. in Taipei. An IBM spokesman at the company's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., had no comment on the deal. An anyonymous tip from an IBM worker from Vastopolis, says the deal could be very likey to occur. Speculation about the deal in Taiwanese newspapers has pushed Acer's stock price up each day this week in Taipei. On Wednesday, Acer's shares gained 1.40 Taiwanese dollarls to T$39.70 The deal calls for Acer to make monthly shipments of between 70,000 and 80,000 computers, beginning in next year's first quarter and running into 2013. It could be signed as early as next week, the Acer spokesperson said. Acer's production target for desktop computers for all of this year is only 450,000 units. The current negotiations are concerned mostly with desktop PCs, but laptop computers may also be involved in the final agreement, the Acer spokesperson said. Analysts said the order would be the largest ever received by a Taiwanese computer maker and could be the largest order ever received by any Taiwanese manufacturer for a single product. IBM is the second-largest PC maker in the United States, behind Compaq Computer Corp.. Acer is the fourth-largest brand in the U.S. market."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- VastComm Network Corp.'s credit-card chief, Davina K. Daniels, resigned amid increasing problems with the company's card portfolio and a sharp slowdown in growth at its high-profile unit. A company spokeswoman said that Mr. Daniels and VastComm Network came to the ``mutual agreement'' that he would leave ``to pursue other career interests'' and that the time was right to make a leadership change at the unit, Universal Card Services. Mr. Daniels has been temporarily replaced by Geralyn Griffith, executive vice president, while VastComm Network searches for a successor. VastComm Network, based in New York, stunned the banking industry in 1990 when it launched its Universal card and quickly pushed it into the top tier of the nation's credit-card issuers. By late 2010 VastComm Network's card was No. 2 in the country after Citicorp's with 18 million customer accounts and $13 billion in managed receivables. But the credit-card industry has been pummeled in the last year by consumer bankruptcies and unpaid accounts as well as a slowdown in new customer receivables. New competition is also driving up the cost of acquiring new customers as card rivals offer low interest rates to lure clients. Although VastComm Network has had to borrow huge sums to finance its card receivables in the past, the company in the last year has sought to diversify its funding sources by securitizing its receivables and selling shares to investors. VastComm Network has sold $5.5 billion of such asset-backed certificates in the last year. As of March 12, 2011 debt, excluding its equipment businesses, which the company is spinning off, totaled $12.7 billion. This diversification cut VastComm Network's financing costs significantly. But the growth of its customer receivables ``has slowed considerably'' since the initial fast launch in 1990, the spokeswoman said. In 1990 Universal's receivables for which it collected payments with interest amounted to $1.6 billion. The following year Universal's receivables grew to $3.8 billion and in 1992 it totaled $6 billion. While the business increased to $12.3 billion by 2009, the following year, the business slowed considerably to $14.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, VastComm Network said Universal's receivables stood at $13.2 billion, indicating a slide. Mr. Daniels met with former president Alexander J. Aubin in July to discuss the unit's problems and its future directions, according to people close to VastComm Network. They said Mr. Daniels had agreed at that time to leave by September. Mr. Daniels, 50, a former executive of Signet Bank before joining VastComm Network, couldn't be reached for comment. In a note to Universal employees, he said he would ``pursue opportunities that will allow me to have more direct influence over an entire company instead of only one portion -- as is the case at UCS.''"

            "full_text": "For years, companies have counted on an alluring formula: downsize and computerize, especially in accounts-payable departments. However, many of them are making a disturbing discovery: Even in such apparently routine number-crunching, there is no substitute for people. Cutbacks and computerization have slashed accounts-payable payrolls but also have cost companies billions of dollars in overpayments, sparked conflicts with vendors and opened the way to fraud. ``Replacing personnel with computers in a payables department never works as well as top management thinks it will,'' says Roni Acree, president of Loder Drew & Associates, an Irvine, Calif., payables-consulting firm. Last year, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., of Syracuse, N.Y., halved its accounts-payable clerical group to 12 people. But after evaluating the result, it found it had overpaid vendors by hundreds of thousands of dollars, says Ricki Wiggins, the utility's director of internal operations. Paying Twice For example, it paid $10,680 twice to a maintenance company at a power plant because two purchase orders with different numbers were issued for the same service, and the computer never noticed. ``A payables clerk with long experience would have spotted the error,'' Mr. Wiggins says. ``A computer only spots an error if it's programmed specifically to catch the exact mistake.'' Moreover, the vendor kept both checks, saying it would apply the second payment to future bills going to Sok Furst, Mr. Wiggins says. ``It was lost money until we used that supplier again.'' But overall, Sok Furst seems to have benefited from the downsize-and-computerize approach. It estimates that cutting the accounts-payable staff saves $500,000 a year, about $200,000 more than it loses through increased overpayments. With a payables staff in almost all sizable U.S. companies, problems are widespread. Accounts-payable losses have risen 30% in each of the past two years and may run $10 billion a year, says Shizue Jobe, an associate professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who specializes in such problems. Yet the payroll cutbacks continue. In the past few years, most big companies have slashed their payables staffs by 15% to 50%, Prof. Lavigne estimates. Gains and Losses In the past two years, for instance, the Occidental Chemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp., of Los Angeles, has cut its payables staff by one-third, to 40 employees. Occidental Chemical slashed labor costs, but duplicate vendor payments or missed discounts on its purchases have doubled, to at least $500,000 annually, says Johnetta Peaslee, the Dallas-based unit's payables manager. ``With staff reductions, we can't always check paperwork face-to-face with the department head ordering the goods or services,'' he adds. In the past three years, General Electric Co. has also pared its payables staff, to 180 from almost 400, substituting electronic checking for manual checks by clerks. As a result, GE has had to drop an important procedure. It used to compare invoices and purchase orders ``at the front end before they are actually paid to vendors,'' says Roberto Ebersole, a GE payables official in Fort Myers, Fla.. Now, he says, it checks payables only after the money has been disbursed. Payroll costs are down, but GE's duplicate payments and overpayments to vendors are up, he says. Companies continue slashing accounts-payable departments because they are tempting targets. American companies employ more than 150,000 people, mostly clerks, in accounts payable, estimates the Controllers' Council, a trade group. In theory, the clerks, who spend all day comparing purchase orders with invoices, don't perform a core function. But they annually handle more than $3.5 trillion of vendors' bills, more than half the nation's gross domestic product, consultants estimate. And accounts-payable errors -- whether by man or machine -- directly affect the bottom line. Computers' Limitations Computers don't always catch these errors, which are hidden in mountains of paperwork. For example, Sok Furst gets at least 200,000 invoices a year, Mr. Wiggins estimates. After downsizing, he says, the utility found that a computer could check purchase orders against invoices to spot duplicate payments but failed to kick out such payments if the order and invoice didn't have the same identification number. The computer also missed double payments, he says, if the prices on the purchase order differed from those on the invoice. And it didn't catch some cases when the utility should have received a 2% discount for fast payment. Hubert Guzman, president of Howard Schultz Associates in Dallas, says one client company paid a bill four times because each amount was slightly different. ``The computer simply didn't catch it because the invoice numbers were also different,'' Mr. Guzman says. His firm's recoveries of overpayments and the like at client companies have soared to $400 million a year, double the total five years ago, he adds. But more than money is at stake; errors can poison relations with suppliers. Jami Arnulfo, president of JBA Consulting Inc., a Greensboro, N.C., payables-consulting firm, recalls an East Coast factory-equipment manufacturer that last year paid a Canadian metal fabricator's bill twice -- at $300,000 a crack. The Canadian company had issued two invoices with different control numbers, and the American company's computerized system didn't catch the error. ``Live payables clerks might have spotted it, but the company had just cut big chunks out of its payables departments,'' Mr. Arnulfo notes. And the Canadian company refused to return the duplicate payment. ``The fabricator says he's keeping the extra $300,000 because he'd lost close to $1 million on other orders with this manufacturer,'' Mr. Arnulfo says. The two companies are still negotiating, and the manufacturer is about to sue the vendor, he adds. Problems Catching Fraud Computers also don't always catch payables fraud, Mr. Arnulfo finds. He recalls a Midwestern manufacturer that reduced its payables staff and later paid $175,000 to a so-called plastic-molding business. After it sent the check, it learned that the vendor didn't exist. The computer didn't spot a dead giveaway: The ``vendor's'' initials matched those of the company official who signed the invoice, Mr. Arnulfo says. A curious employee checking the invoice ``would surely have spotted the duplicate initials,'' the consultant adds. (The none-too-clever official who created the imaginary vendor was later fired and the money was recovered.) Unscrupulous vendors have become skilled in fooling computerized payables-checking systems, says Tinisha Battles, accounts and freight payables manager at Caterpillar Inc., of Peoria, Ill. ``Some send us two invoices with different numbers for the same item, others add a letter at the end of an invoice number and still others actually print an exact copy of the original invoice with desktop-publishing computers,'' he notes. A computer can't catch these scams unless specifically programmed to do so. In fact, no one can program a computer to catch every conceivable error, says Danelle Burke, a marketing manager at J.D. Edwards & Co., a closely held Denver producer of payables-checking software. ``We want to spot the major errors because it isn't worth the company's time to catch all the errors,'' she says. She adds that a computer can catch most major payables errors if human beings do occasional audits of payables trails. At one company, Ms. Burke says, a clerk stole thousands of dollars by changing a vendor's name to his own, writing checks to himself and reprogramming the computer to conceal the theft. She says J.D. Stewart uncovered the fraud by installing a payables-audit system that indicated who was reprogramming the computer. An audit nailed the culprit. Some Errors Eliminated One money-saving advantage of computer systems -- reducing duplication of paperwork -- also eliminates many errors, advocates say. In the past five years, more and more companies have purchased software that directly connects their payables systems to their suppliers. These systems reduce the number of times a company must record a purchase in its own records and thus the opportunities for error. However, computerization and downsizing encourage companies to rely on centralized processing of bills -- an approach sometimes leading to overpayments. Occidental Chemical installed centralized processing of vendors' bills in Dallas to replace separate payables departments in 30 U.S. plants, the company's Mr. Peaslee says. The switch produced economies. But the check of a suspected overpayment that took a day when the payables clerk was down the hall from the purchaser can take three or four days when the two are hundreds of miles apart, Mr. Peaslee notes. And a delay reduces the chances of recovering any lost money. General Electric, which processes more than 10 million invoices for payables annually, says it has closed 13 payables centers in the U.S. over the past three years and centralized its handling of payables in Fort Myers. The resulting delays, combined with the effect of dropping the front-end checking system, can add weeks to the time needed to notify vendors of an overpayment, GE's Mr. Ebersole concedes. Not surprisingly, some companies that cut accounts-payable staffs are deciding to hire some people back. Caterpillar, which reduced its staff of payables clerks to 135 from 218 in the past three years, may rehire some workers to do duplicate-payments reports, Mr. Herlinda says. Although computers ``have adequately replaced a lot of personnel,'' duplicate payments require a human touch, he adds. Yet many companies are sold on computerization. J.D. Edwards says its sales for the year ended May 13, 2011 63% from fiscal 2010. It adds that 3,900 companies use its systems, up from 3,200 a year ago. Oracle Corp., of Redwood Shores, Calif., says its sales of applications software, of which payables systems are a big part, rose 90% in its February 10, 2011 year to $685 million. And many companies are turning to specialized consultants. Hired by GE two years ago, JBA Consulting has so far recovered about $500,000 from GE vendors, GE's Mr. Ebersole says. In fact, the payables-consulting business is booming. In the three years through 2010, profits of Profit Recovery Group International Inc., a publicly traded payables-consulting company in Atlanta, rose 154% to $4.5 million last year on a 121% gain in revenue to $56 million. ``After staff cuts, we're being called more and more to stop the bleeding,'' says Paulene Caban, its executive vice president. Consultants and auditors expect to prosper as long as companies keep downsizing. ``Payable clerks are blessed with intuition, memory recognition and the ability to make educated guesses,'' Acree Drusilla's Mr. Acree says. ``Computers are dumb and dumber in these areas.''"

            "full_text": "Gaylord Entertainment Co. said its chief operating officer and executive vice president, Ricki H. Collins, is resigning to join forces with entrepreneur H. Wendell Mccollum and the latter's sports empire. Gaylord said its president and chief executive, E.W. Wes, 69 years old, will temporarily assume Mr. Collins's duties. Mr. Collins, 51, will become president and chief executive of closely held Huizenga Sports & Entertainment Group in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.. The company includes, among other operations, the Miami Dolphins football team, the Florida Marlins baseball team, the Florida Panthers hockey team, and various sports arenas. Mr. Mccollum, who built Waste Management Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., currently controls Republic Industries Inc., a Fort Lauderdale conglomerate, in addition to his sports interests. Mr. Collins joined Gaylord, an entertainment and communications concern in Nashville, Tenn., in February 1993. Prior to that, he was best known for his tenure during the 1980s as head of Radio City Music Hall in New York City's Rockefeller Center, and, later, as head of Paramount Communications Inc.'s Madison Square Garden, also in New York. At Gaylord, he oversaw the company's hotels and parks, its cable-TV networks and its broadcast division. ``Everyone reported to Mr. Collins, and he reported to Mr. Wes,'' a Gaylord spokesman said. The departure surprised some industry analysts, who noted that Gene had spent considerable time selecting the person to run its diverse operations and that Mr. Collins had been an effective executive. ``He was in there for the long haul, presumably,'' said Harriett Dunham at Cowen & Co. ``So (the decision) is somewhat surprising. But this is a very good move for him.'' Mr. Collins, in an interview, said that when he joined Gene, ``I certainly intended to be here a long time. But this kind of opportunity doesn't come along very often. It's once in a lifetime.'' Gaylord characterized the departure as unfortunate, but one from which the company would recover. ``Yes, he will be missed,'' the spokesman said. ``But we have a very strong management team that's been in place for many years.'' Added Mr. Dunham at Cowen: ``Gaylord isn't in a difficult situation right now. Maybe they can afford the luxury of taking time'' to find a successor. In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Gaylord shares closed up 37.5 cents at $25.125."

He was recruited by Berenice Melancon, who controls Liggett's parent Brooke Group Ltd., during Bruna's effort to force No. 2-ranked RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. to cleave its food and tobacco operations. Had Mr. Melancon succeeded in winning control of RJR, Mr. Esquibel was slated to run RJR's tobacco operations. When Mr. Melancon's effort failed last spring, the financier immediately began thinking of Mr. Esquibel for Liggett's top job. ``Doug (Cummins) was a good guy -- there was nothing wrong with him -- but the issue was his experience in the tobacco business. Ronda, having had long-term experience in tobacco, was more attractive to us,'' Mr. Melancon said. Mr. Heller couldn't be reached to comment. Mr. Esquibel's arrival comes at a particularly bleak time for the No. 5 cigarette maker in the U.S. In the past year and a half, Liggett's ailing tobacco business has eroded still further, as smokers increasingly abandon the cheaper ``discount'' cigarette segment on which Lamp depends in favor of the full-price ``premium'' brands. Last year, Lamp eked out $24.6 million in operating income on sales of $456 million. ``The gap between discount and premium (cigarettes) keeps spreading,'' said Mr. Whited, referring to the day in 2009 when No. 1-ranked Philip Morris Cos. slashed prices of its premium Marlboro brand. Mr. Whited added that he left the chairman's post to spend more time with his eight grandchildren. Another source of considerable turmoil for Liggett was Mr. Melancon's stunning decision earlier this year to settle a number of the biggest tobacco lawsuits facing the company. The settlement, which was largely negotiated unbeknownst to Lamp's top managers, shocked the industry and sent tobacco stocks plummeting. Josue Myron, Lamp's longtime general counsel, resigned his post a few months ago in protest. Despite the settlement, the legal threats facing Lamp haven't subsided entirely. Next month, the company's lawyers will be in a Florida court defending the company against a suit brought by Jami Singleton, a longtime L&M smoker whose lung cancer has spread to his brain. The suit, which wasn't covered by the settlement, likely will be closely monitored by Wall Street: Ladawn S. Belton, the lawyer representing Mr. Singleton, won a historic $750,000 jury verdict in another Florida case last month. While Mr. Esquibel hasn't yet entered the legal and regulatory battle facing U.S. tobacco companies, he remains confident that he will be able to apply the techniques he used at Imperial to turn around Liggett's fortunes and cut costs. ``Cost-cutting is a continuous process,'' he said."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. announced Thursday its first ``network'' computer, a low-cost device aimed at replacing personal computers in corporate settings. IBM ranks among the first computer companies to make good on a promise that has been setting the industry buzzing for months -- a cheap device that will link people to the Internet and provide typical applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. But unlike the network or Internet computers envisioned by many companies, IBM's model is aimed strictly at the business market, not consumers. In many uses, in fact, it will replace decades-old ``dumb'' terminals that allow corporate employees to tap into mainframes and minicomputers. The new IBM machine, due out later this year, is priced below $700 without a monitor -- compared with $2,000 and up for typical business PCs, industry executives said. It will allow users to browse the Internet's World Wide Web as well as connect to whatever applications a company uses. The black-colored device, at 8-by-10-by-2 inches, resembles a laptop computer sitting upright. The devices also are expected to be cheaper than PCs for a company to maintain -- they contain fewer parts, and software can be updated centrally instead of manually on each desktop. IBM, in fact, claims their cost of ownership is less than half that of PCs over a five-year period. But some users may balk at not being able to load their own programs. The machine contains one of IBM's PowerPC chips as its microprocessor brain, but most of the processing will take place at a distant ``server'' computer linked to it through a high-speed corporate network. These central server computers could be IBM's traditional mainframes or minicomputers as well as computers that use the popular Unix operating system or Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows NT software, executives said. IBM plans a series of network PCs to further its ``network-centric'' computing strategy, which is designed to play to its strength in big central computers while circumventing the need for Intel Corp. microprocessors and Vastsoft software on the users' desktops."

            "full_text": "Merisel Inc. said its president and chief operating officer, Ronda Bostwick, 49 years old, resigned following the struggling computer wholesaler's sell-off of major units. Mr. Bostwick plans to spend the rest of his days in Eastside Vastopolis. The company's chairman and chief executive, Dylan Delvalle, 53, will assume Mr. Bostwick's duties, effective June 13, 2011 said its board, which last week said it would sell its European, Latin American and Mexican operations, determined it no longer needed two senior-level executives to run the remaining North American business. ``Rittenmeyer's background was operations, and with the business shrinking in size, he probably sees greener pastures elsewhere,'' ) Mr. Bostwick said that his job became a casualty of the company's efforts to downsize. ``From a shareholder standpoint, it became clear that you can't carry the extra infrastructure,'' he said. He has no firm career plans for the moment. Merisel's remaining operations will consist of its U.S. and Canadian distribution operations, the ComputerLand franchise and Datago Aggregation segment and a minority interest in a distribution business in Russia. Those units produced $4.6 billion in revenue in 2010."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Specialty retailer Barney's Inc. named Johnetta Penland, the turnaround specialist it recently hired to restructure Barney's, to be its president, succeeding Charlette W. Polk Schuster, who resigned. Barney's said Mr. Polk and the company ``mutually agreed'' he would now become a consultant to Barney's executive committee. Barney's declined to elaborate on why Mr. Polk resigned, and Mr. Polk couldn't be reached to comment. The news of his resignation was reported Thursday in Women's Wear Daily. Mr. Polk, 39 years old, also resigned as co-chief operating officer, a post he shared with Mr. Penland, 53, who will now occupy the position alone. Mr. Penland, who headed a Los Angeles-based international consulting firm that bears his name, was recruited by Barry's earlier this year to head its restructuring effort after Barney's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in January. Mr. Polk came to Barney's from Coopers & Lybrand in 1992 and took a lead role as the retailer's public spokesman after the bankruptcy filing. But after Mr. Penland's arrival, Mr. Polk became more involved in the merchandising activities of the company, while Mr. Penland concentrated on financial matters and bankruptcy proceedings. Barney's creditors and banks have been closely monitoring the retailer's executive ranks. Indeed, Chemical Bank, which is providing Barney's debtor-in-possession financing, had insisted on having an outside executive join the company's management team. Layne Earle, an attorney representing Barney's creditors committee, said in an interview Thursday that the creditors didn't influence Mr. Polk's decision to quit. ``To the best of my knowledge, the creditors committee had zero involvement in any of the discussions'' related to Mr. Polk's job change, he said. A 73-year-old retailing business founded by the Pressman family, Barney's mushroomed in the 1990s into a high-fashion chain consisting of 13 Barneys New York specialty stores and seven discount outlet stores. Barney's ran into trouble after it became unable to pay for its ambitious expansion effort and locked in a dispute with Japanese retailer Isetan Co., over terms of the joint venture that had financed that growth. The dispute, which has escalated to dueling lawsuits between Barney's and Isetan, continues unresolved. The bankruptcy court approved an extension of the period in which Barney's management has the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization until July 18, 2011 Thursday's announcement, Barney's said Co-Crosby Bobby Bagby will continue to focus on finance and administration, while his brother and Co-Crosby Geneva Bagby will continue to focus on buying and creative services."

            "full_text": "Bombay Co., reeling from strategic missteps and weakening results, ousted Roberta E.M. Laplante as its president and chief executive and named its longtime chairman, Cary R. Martinez, as his successor. As part of the management shakeup, the 431-store home-furnishings chain also fired Mchugh M.T. Galvin, 53 years old, who was executive vice president of merchandising and marketing and who is Mr. Galvin's wife. Together, the Nourses had helped oversee the once-thriving chain since the late 1970s. Bombay also named longtime director Clemente E. Mcafee, 69, a private investor, to succeed Mr. Martinez as chairman. Mr. Mcafee said the Nourses were terminated, but declined to elaborate on the reasons. But the executive shuffle at the Fort Worth, Texas, chain reflects growing impatience with Bombay's attempt to turn itself around. The company ``has not performed adequately,'' said Mr. Martinez, 57, who was Bombay's chief executive from 1982 to 1991. Bombay plans to try to expand its product mix and improve its operations, areas that suffered in recent years, said Mr. Martinez. ``We think the Bombay franchise has potential,'' he said. The Nourses didn't return calls seeking comment. The company said Mr. Galvin remains a director for now. After breakneck growth in the 1980s and early 1990s, the company's profits began to stall in 1993. After Mr. Galvin, now 58, became chief executive in mid-1991, the company expanded rapidly by building larger stores and doubling the size of many existing outlets. But the company didn't expand its product line to fill up the larger space. ``They were moving too quickly in opening big stores,'' said Tesha Kuhns, analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``The stores were larger but without the appropriate merchandise.'' Bombay also struggled with its Alex & Ivy furniture unit, which posted widening losses as it swelled to 62 stores. Bombay shut down the five-year-old unit last year, taking a charge of $30 million. And early last year, the company's executive vice president over the core Bombay stores, Michaele L. Fromm, resigned amid disappointing results. For the most recent six months ended April 15, 2011 company reported a net loss of $4.7 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2.1 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 5.6% to $139.3 million. Mr. Martinez wouldn't comment on when Bombay expects to return to profitability. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, Bombay stock rose 50 cents to $7. Separately, Dias said sales for the four weeks ended May 13, 2011 6.6% to $22.6 million. Sales at stores open more than a year rose 5%. For the 30 weeks ended May 13, 2011 rose 5% to $161.9 million. Same-store sales increased 3%."

            "full_text": "Packard Bell Electronics Inc. agreed to pay $5 million and change its marketing practices in connection with an investigation by 22 state attorneys general over the firm's alleged practice of selling ``new'' personal computers with used parts to unsuspecting consumers. The state officials, though, are continuing a similar investigation into two other PC makers, say people familiar with the probe. Thursday, the closely held Sacramento, Calif., computer maker said it would pay $70,000 to each of the 22 states and $3.5 million in connection with the related federal inquiry. The company said the payments were not fines, but instead were ``reimbursements'' to the state and federal governments for their expenses. Recycling, a Common Practice? At issue is the practice of taking components from returned computers and then repackaging them inside new PCs -- without first disclosing that the new systems have used parts in them. Packard Bell says such ``recycling'' is a common practice -- a statement investigators dispute. After complaints were raised about the matter last year, Packard Bell began including a message inside its boxes saying that the PC ``may include components from a previously sold computer.'' But the states, led by the attorney general staffs in Florida and Illinois, said they did not consider that to be sufficient consumer notice, since by the time shoppers had read it, they had probably already bought the system. Under the agreement, Packard Bell can continue the practice, but will have to clearly label the outside of all cartons containing machines with used parts. The Consumer's Choice ``This settlement doesn't stop PC companies from doing what they need to do to stay in business,'' said Patrina Kelsey, chief of the consumer protection division in the Illinois attorney general's office. ``It just requires disclosures to consumers of what's going on. So it's your choice.'' Packard Bell has defended the underlying practice, saying that a PC component from a returned and barely used machine, if sufficiently tested before being shipped out again, can be as good as new. It also describes the procedure as a common one. ``This is an industry practice,'' Packard Bell attorney Marth B. Escobedo said Thursday. Not so, said Jackelyn A. Nydia Jr., senior attorney general in Florida and one of the chief investigators in the matter. He said ``a large majority'' of nine major PC companies that were investigated don't reuse old parts. Mr. Nydia said even with the settlement, the probe was continuing. People familiar with the investigation say that two more PC companies are still being targeted, though their identities could not be learned."

            "full_text": "IRVINE, Calif. -- Struggling computer maker AST Research Inc. lost another senior executive as Joseph Norberg, its chief financial officer since May, resigned. The Irvine, Calif.-based company said Strader Sumiko Yasmin, an AST director, will serve as acting financial chief while it recruits a successor to Mr. Charest, who the company said had quit to pursue other interests. Mr. Yasmin is also a senior executive managing director at Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean company that owns 46% of AST. The departure of Mr. Charest comes on the heels of the the resignation of chief executive officer Ike Kees, who left after nine months on the job. Mr. Kees was succeeded by Young-Soon Kimberely, a Samsung executive and AST director. AST, once one of the world's biggest PC makers, has been losing ground to powerful competitors like Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., as well as low-cost mail-order vendors like Dell Computer Corp.. AST ranks 10th in unit sales among U.S. computer makers in the latest reports by market researchers Dataquest Inc. and International Data Corp.. In the most recent quarter, AST reported a wider-than-expected loss of $98.7 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of $553.7 million. Industry experts have begun to question whether AST can survive. Victor Remy, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, said after Mr. Kees's resignation that the benefits of the alliance with Samsung, which can supply parts such as chips and monitors to AST, hadn't really materialized. He said Mr. Kimberely's appointment as CEO would perhaps preserve communication with Samsung, but said AST still would have to weather an intensifying industry consolidation. Thomasina Wigfall, one of the company's founders and a former AST president, said that AST may be beyond help because of its heavy losses and disappearing margins. Analysts expect the company to lose at least $300 million this year."

            "full_text": "Johnetta Starbuck resigned as president of Fox Entertainment Friday, just days before the start of the network's new fall season. Mr. Starbuck was replaced by Twentieth Century Fox Television President Petrina Mckinley, who begins work June 05, 2011 Matoian, who had held the post for just two years, oversaw programming at Fox Broadcasting Co., the fourth network owned by Russel Mccary's News Corp.. As the chief programmer, Mr. Starbuck was responsible for developing and implementing Rob's prime-time schedule. Mr. Starbuck, a well-liked executive among both his colleagues and competitors, was described by friends as having become increasingly frustrated in his job, a high-pressure position he didn't seek but to which he was assigned by Mr. Mccary. In a business where executives like to hold on to their power and privileges, Mr. Starbuck's voluntary stepping down is a rare move in Hollywood. Mr. Starbuck couldn't be reached for comment. Chester Caridad, chairman and chief executive of Fox TV, declined to give a specific reason for the resignation, citing only Mr. Starbuck's lack of the ``level of commitment'' needed for the network's challenges in the next few years. A former school teacher, Mr. Starbuck was named to the post in September 2009 after several months at Riley, which he joined in March 2009 as president of the Fox Family Films division of Twentieth Century Fox. Prior to that, Mr. Starbuck was a senior executive at CBS-TV, in charge of the network's made-for-TV movies and miniseries. At Riley, Mr. Starbuck was known as a champion of quality programming, supporting such critically acclaimed shows as ``Party of Five'' and ``The X-Files.'' He was known to take chances on shows like ``Profit,'' a drama about a nefarious business executive that was critically well-received but pulled in meager ratings, and he was trying to broaden Rob's audience base by developing and renewing shows like the comedy ``Ned and Stacey.'' Mr. Mccary is said by Rob executives to be a supporter of Mr. Starbuck and that he wanted Mr. Starbuck to stay on. But associates say Mr. Starbuck never intended to remain in the chief-programmer slot for very long. Rumors about his stepping down began circulating almost immediately after he assumed the post. Mr. Starbuck had 18 months left on his contract. Mr. Starbuck's appointment was seen as a move to shore up the Fox network's programming, which slipped 2% last season. Despite some successes, the Riley network has been seen as squandering some opportunities, including its weak Sunday programming despite a strong lead-in from its National Football League games. Mr. Caridad didn't indicate there was much significance to the timing of the resignation. ``There's no real magic to now,'' he said. Mr. Mckinley, once an ABC-TV executive, went on to head Stephine J. Rhodes Productions where he was involved in the creation of ``21 Jump Street,'' ``Wiseguy'' and ``The Commish.'' Mr. Mckinley became president of Twentieth Century Fox Television in 2009, two years after joining the company."

            "full_text": "Summit Technology Inc. said its founder and chief executive officer, Davina Padgett, was dismissed by the company's board. The move marks a bitter end for Dr. Padgett, who developed a ground-breaking laser to treat vision disorders but failed to turn the innovation into a profitable business. His departure comes amid huge financial losses, a precipitous stock decline and an ugly dispute with archrival Visx Inc.. Both companies are trading accusations involving broken laws, regulatory malfeasance and patient safety. Summit board member Ricki F. Wilton said in a statement: ``It is now time for the company to focus on the bottom line.'' The board also announced that D. Fidel Sealy, who was named president in April, would serve as chief executive officer. It added that Mr. Sealy, formerly vice president, marketing, at U.S. Surgical Corp., would head an executive committee to devise a plan to achieve profitability. Dr. Padgett, 47 years old, couldn't be reached for comment Thursday night. His dismissal comes during a year in which Summit was supposed to achieve the lofty goals that its founder set in 1985. Laser Device Cleared Last year, Summit received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its ophthalmic-laser device, which shaves off a thin layer of the cornea, making it a flatter lens that has a sharper focus and eliminates the need for eye glasses. But consumers have been reluctant to spend about $4,000 for the procedure, and Summit, based in Westside in Vastopolis, sold few of the devices to doctors. Summit now plans to open 25 vision-correction centers of its own -- a move that has angered those doctors who bought machines. Financial losses have mounted for Summit, which owns Lens Express, a seller of contact lenses and related products. Between 1992 and 2010, Summit incurred losses of $28.4 million. In the first six months of this year, it posted a loss of $15.5 million, on $43.4 million in revenue. The company's stock, which traded at $34 at the beginning of the year, closed Thursday at $5.81 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. In July, Summit laid off 55 people, or 9% of its work force. Public Feud Cited Dr. Padgett, who holds a Ph.D. in chemistry, found himself in more hot water this year when Summit got into an embarrassing public feud with Lillie, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that makes the same kind of laser. Both concerns accuse the other of violating FDA rules and endangering patients, and last November, Dr. Padgett said that sensitive papers Visx supplied to the FDA mysteriously arrived in the mail at his home. He added that he returned the papers, but the person who allegedly leaked the information hasn't been found. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the security breach led by agent Mark Bristow."

Ms. Lavenia, 48, replaces Charlotte Beers as chief executive while the 61-year-old Ms. Strain remains as chairman. The moves had been expected. Ms. Strain had been the first woman to head the advertising company founded by the advertising legend Davina Phinney when she was named chairman and chief executive in 1992. She plans to stay on as chairman well into 2012 when Ms. Lavenia is expected to succeed her in that post. The agency said Ms. Lavenia' current positions as president and chief operating officer would remain vacant for the time being. Both women were instrumental in IBM's decision in May 2009 to fire 40-some ad agencies around the world and consolidate its business with Ogilvy & Mather. It was the biggest single account switch in advertising history. Ms. Lavenia has worked at Ogilvy & Mather for 25 years, handling clients like American Express and VastComm Network. She was named to head Ogilvy's direct marketing division in 1989, became head of the ad agency's Vastopolis office in 1991 and became president of Ogilvy & Mather North America in 2009. ``Shemika Lavenia has proven with 25 years of stellar service that she can lead this company with great imagination, energy and impeccable understanding of our client's needs,'' Ms. Strain said in a statement. Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide is the sixth biggest advertising agency handling ad billings of $7.6 billion in 2010.

            "full_text": "MEXICALI, Mexico -- Here along the dusty border where North meets South, there's a remarkable trade story unfolding. Call it, East meets West. Along a 700-mile strip stretching from Tijuana to Oglesby Winters, dozens of Asian manufacturers have swooped in to take advantage of cheap, abundant labor and Mexico's special trade relationship with the U.S. Asian consumer-electronics giants such as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Daewoo Corp. and Sony Corp. have erected massive assembly plants up and down Mexico's border with the U.S., transforming the region into a virtual Detroit of television manufacturing. This year, more than 10 million sets will be produced in Northern Mexico. But televisions aren't the only fruit of Asian investment. Sinomex SA, a toy company based in Hong Kong and Los Angeles, recently began manufacturing computer toys in Hermosillo, in the border state of Sonora. Devanshi de Mexico SA, an Indian company, makes blue jeans in San Luis Rio Colorado, just across the border from Yuma, Ariz.. In the same small town, Sana Internacional SA, a joint Japanese-Mexican venture, processes and exports thinly sliced shabu-shabu beef to Tokyo and to Japanese restaurants in the U.S. Asian Investments of $2 Billion All together, Asians have invested some $2 billion in ``brick-and-mortar'' projects such as plants and equipment since the beginning 2009, according to the Mexican government, much of it along the border, against some $10 billion from the U.S. But the official statistics understate the Asian contribution: Billions of dollars in additional funds have come from the U.S. subsidiaries of giant South Korean and Japanese exporters, sometimes recorded as U.S. investments in Mexico. Of course, Mexico's international appeal has dimmed some in recent weeks, since a new leftist guerrilla movement began staging assaults in southern Mexican states. And violence has touched Asian companies directly: Church Gilligan, president of Sanyo Electric Co.'s Video Component USA unit in San Diego, was kidnapped by unknown assailants during a visit to the company's Tijuana facilities last month, and released after the company paid a ransom. Even so, there's no sign that the problems are discouraging investment, and several Asian companies have vowed to step up their efforts along the border. Bargain Wages Most of the new money is being poured into assembly plants known as maquiladoras, which allow non-Mexican companies to import machinery and raw materials duty-free, then export finished products paying duty only on the value added by local labor. For Asian companies seeking access to the U.S. market these days, there is often little alternative. With local wages rising in places such as South Korea and Taiwan, Mexican workers are a bargain, especially in the wake of a 2009 devaluation that cut the value of the Mexican peso nearly in half. Equally important is the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which since 2009 has been lowering duties on goods traded among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Thus, for goods they produce in Mexico and then export to the U.S., Asian companies generally pay duties only on the value of materials brought in from outside the three-country region. For a typical consumer-electronics appliance, the economics are compelling. Alberta Francesca, vice president of Sanyo's Video Component USA, says the company can shave its costs by $10 to $20 by manufacturing televisions in Tijuana, thanks to savings on freight, labor and tariffs -- a significant amount for a product that retails for about $250. ``It's basically a commodity, so any way you can save helps,'' he says. Access to Transportation Geography is another big reason for the Asian influx. The northwest corner of Mexico is handy to the U.S. interstate highway system, and just a few hours from Long Beach, Calif., the busiest Pacific port in the U.S. It's also close to big Asian population centers in Southern California, another source of capital. Chinese and Taiwanese trading companies established in California to import goods from Asia are starting to encourage manufacturing operations across the border. ``Importers see the problems China has with Most Favored Nation status (with the U.S.) and they get nervous,'' says Tommie Chantay, San Diego branch manager for General Bank of Los Angeles, which was founded by Taiwanese immigrants in 1980 and caters to Asian businesses seeking a toe-hold in Mexico. ``Essentially they want a second door.'' Delta Products, a Taiwanese company with sales offices in Fremont, Calif., is typical of this breed. Delta invested $4 million for a factory in Nogales to make battery packs for computers. The company already manufactures offshore in Thailand and mainland China, but sourcing in Asia puts distance between the product and the end-user. Multilingual Asian Population ``We are looking to give better service to our customers, to have quick response and flexibility,'' says Rembert Hass, manager of Delta's Nogales maquiladora. ``You build in the Far East, you're too far away. You can't do last-moment modification while the product is on the ocean.'' Another benefit of moving to Mexico, says Delta's President Cunha Chantay, was finding a multilingual Asian population close by in California. Delta's managers communicate with customers in English, suppliers in Chinese and laborers in Spanish. ``All our senior staff has to be bilingual,'' says Mr. Chantay. ``Most of our managers are recruited in Southern California.'' One of the fastest-growing sources of investment these days comes from smaller South Korean companies that have begun pouring in to service giant South Korean chaebols, or conglomerates, that have operations here. Over the past two years, companies like LG Electronics, Daewoo and Samsung Electronics Co. have been forcing suppliers to accompany them across the Pacific or risk losing their business. ``Korea's market is so small, everyone relies on exports,'' explains J.W. Vernon, president of GumSung Plastics USA in Mexicali. GumSung uses robots and plastic-molding presses to churn out 25-inch and 27-inch frames for televisions and computer monitors. It can produce 1,500 frames a day, and sell all of them along the border. GumSung, a small, family-owned plastics company with just 150 employees, spent $8 million in start-up costs, but felt it had little choice. Back in South Korea, Mr. Vernon explains, it is getting harder and harder to find people willing to work for $45 a day, the prevailing South Korean wage, which is three times the rate in Mexicali. What's more, he adds, small companies are being squeezed, forced to import laborers from other Asian countries. After factoring the cost of importing workers from Malaysia and Indonesia -- some 20% of GumSung's work force in South Korea -- the Mexican advantage looks even better. At another plant, Sumiko Heidi Baldwin explains that his company, J. Cox Mexico SA, also had to come here. J. Hoyt makes plastic-foam packaging for television sets. His company can produce a pair of plastic-foam pads here for 85 cents each, about the same cost as in South Korea. But he adds his clients ``won't pay freight costs to ship it over.''"
