            "full_text": "Pounded by a free fall in memory-chip prices, Texas Instruments Inc. said its net income fell 73% in the second quarter on a 12% drop in revenue. Though sales of its specialty semiconductors were strong, they weren't enough to offset price declines of 65% to 75% in memory chips so far this year. And with memory chip supply still surpassing demand, the semiconductor maker said it sees its semiconductor woes continuing for the near term. The price declines have been so severe that Texas Instruments predicts world-wide semiconductor sales could fall by 5% to 10% this year from $150 billion last year, even though some chip businesses, such as microprocessors, remain strong. A decline would be the first contraction in total semiconductor sales since 1985. The Dallas company said it had net income of $76 million, or 39 cents a share, in the second quarter, down from $278 million, or $1.44 a share, in the year-earlier period. The smaller profits also reflected a $105 million decline in royalty payments because some key patent licenses have expired. Revenue fell to $2.85 billion from $3.24 billion a year ago. The results were below analysts' estimates of 53 cents a share, but the company's stock rose $2.50 Tuesday to $44.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. ``The results were very bad, but they reflect the current state of the industry,'' said Thomasina Person, analyst at Merrill Lynch. Still, he is recommending the stock because he believes ``we're at the bottom as far as the industry's inventory cycle.'' Compounding the business challenges was the sudden death of TI Chairman and Chief Executive Jesica Burkett in late May, making recent weeks ``a difficult and tragic time,'' said Williemae A. Ratcliffe, TI's chief financial officer. TI said lower chip prices, along with the cost of increasing production at its Avezzano, Italy, plant, resulted in a loss in its memory-chip operations. Mr. Ratcliffe said that 16 megabit chips that sold for $50 to $55 each late last year now sell for $11 to $13.50 Wednesday as computer makers, facing slower growth, keep slimmer inventories. At the same time, TI's revenue from its digital signal processors and other specialty chips climbed, making that business about 25% of TI's semiconductor sales, up from 10% a couple of years ago, Mr. Ratcliffe said. He said sales of TI's notebook computer sales also rose sharply, though the business isn't yet profitable. Operating results are expected to be about the same in the third quarter, although TI also said it will take a $180 million charge related to a recent acquisition, a move that likely will result in a net loss. In response to the lower prices, TI said it will trim its 2011 capital spending to $2.3 billion from the $2.5 billion it planned. But it said it is pushing ahead with plans for the next generation of memory chips, expecting world-wide semiconductor sales to double to $300 billion over the next five years."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co., the biggest U.S. securities firm, on Tuesday said second-quarter profits soared 53% to a new record amid booming revenues from securities trading, investment banking and investor fees. The results were Wall Street's latest reflection of the bull market in stocks this past spring. PaineWebber Group Inc., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and Travelers Group Inc.'s Smith Barney Inc. on Monday all reported sharply stronger profits from commissions from investors and stronger revenues from their own trading desks. Merrill Lynch said it earned a record $433 million, or $2.19 per share, on record revenue of $3.38 billion in the three months ended March 10, 2011 with $283 million, or $1.40 per share, on revenue of $2.55 billion, in the same period of 2010. The profits exceeded expectations of about $1.89 per share in a survey of analysts by International Inc.. In midday composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Merrill's stock was up 25 cents a share to $56.50. The firm cited a 27% increase, to $970 million, in revenues from commissions as investors rushed to buy mutual funds and individual stocks. Revenues rose 48%, to $908 million, from Merrill's trading desks, particularly in mortgage-backed, municipal and corporate bonds, stocks and interest-rate and currency derivatives. Revenues from investment banking strengthened 73%, to a record $580 million, led by growth in underwriting new stocks and bonds for client companies. Merrill remained the world's biggest underwriter of new stocks and bonds during the quarter after seven consecutive years at No. 1, according to Securities Data Co.. To help ride out sudden market downturns, Merrill Lynch is stressing such businesses as managing investments for large institutional investors and investing in new computer technology, chairman and chief executive Daniele P. Szymanski and chief operating officer Davina H. Burgos said in a statement. For the first half of 2011, Merrill Lynch's profits jumped 65.2% to $843 million, or $4.22 per share, from $510 million, or $2.48 per share, in the first half of 2010."

            "full_text": "German electronics and engineering firm Siemens AG bucked the high-technology industry's downdraft in the latest nine months, but the company said it is reviewing plans to expand chip-making capacity. Still, investors were cheered when Siemens executives cautiously reaffirmed their forecast of a 20% profit gain for the year ending June 12, 2011 said group net profit rose 18% in the latest nine-month period to 1.65 billion marks ($1.08 billion) from 1.41 billion marks a year earlier. The news boosted the company's stock by 1.1%, or 90 pfennig, to 80.45 marks in Frankfurt trading. ``It will take major efforts in the remaining months to reach the targeted 20% increase in earnings,'' Chairman Gault Waldo Ginsberg said at the group's traditional summer news conference. ``But we see no reason to question this goal.'' Chip-Making a New Concern While Siemens appears to be weathering the storm that has battered other high-technology issues in recent weeks, company executives said they are reviewing plans to build more chip-making capacity, in light of the apparent slowdown in the market. Siemens executives said the review should be completed within two months, and didn't give any signal as to whether they expect to cancel or defer planned spending. ``It would be premature to make an announcement about a clear pullback in investments,'' said Karl-Fryer Yount, the group's chief financial officer. Although earnings from the semiconductors group, last year's cash cow, are declining, the area will remain Siemens' biggest generator of profits, company officials said. ``The results are below last year's but are within our expectations,'' Mr. Yount said. A sharper-than-expected plunge in memory products, which account for 40% to 45% of the unit's business, was partially offset by stronger gains from restructuring efforts, he said. Less than a year ago, Siemens announced plans to build a $1.5 billion semiconductor factory in the U.S. in conjunction with Motorola Inc. and to spend another two billion marks building a separate factory in northern England. But that was when industrywide sales were exploding and experts saw no signs of a glut. That's no longer the case. Cypress Semiconductor Corp. of the U.S. recently postponed construction of a new factory, and several Japanese firms are scaling back planned production increases as well. Small Growth in Orders In a further sign of slowing demand and falling prices for electronics, new orders for Siemens semiconductors edged up merely 2% from a year earlier to 3.8 billion marks. That's a dramatic change from three months ago, when orders were running 12% ahead of the year-earlier rate. Petra Pacheco, an electronics analyst at UBS Ltd. in London, said he wouldn't be surprised to see a rescheduling of Siemens' capital investment -- ``a longer time before they start building.'' But he was more skeptical about any cancellation of plans. While Mr. Waldo Ginsberg was slightly cautious about the bottom line, he said Siemens could exceed its more modest full-year forecasts for higher sales and orders, largely because of more-favorable currency conversions from the U.S. dollar, Italian lira and British pound. Analysts also cited the sharp decline in restructuring costs that Siemens is likely to report for the full year. In fact, company officials conceded that operating results will show little improvement. But analysts also noted that the group no longer is speculating about a profit jump that could be as high as 25%. Non-German Sales Support Results Sales after nine months rose 7% from a year earlier to 64.5 billion marks from 60.2 billion marks. A 15% jump in business outside Germany powered the rise. Siemens had been predicting that full-year sales will increase by no more than 4.7% to 93 billion marks. Growth during the latest quarter came primarily from the communications and information segments as well as the automotive systems group, Vasquez said. The public communication network group, which builds telephone switches and lines, profited from Deutsche Telekom AG's decision to speed up the digitization of the country's phone lines, while business in applications and networks fueled growth in the private communication systems group. Private network sales jumped 18% to six billion marks, while revenues at the public network group climbed 12% to 7.8 billion marks. Sales at the smaller automotive-systems group surged 25% to three billion marks. Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG, the No. 3 personal-computer producer in Europe, reported a 14% climb in sales to 9.7 billion marks, a slightly slower rate than the 16% increase reported after six months. SNI is still expected to improve on last year's first-ever profit, but will be burdened by a write-down on its 12.5% stake in computer maker Escom AG, which began bankruptcy proceedings on Monday. Sales of semiconductors rose 13% to 3.4 billion marks, compared with the 18% rate reported through December 11, 2010 demand for memory components is clearly dropping, and business in passive components has cooled,'' Mr. Waldo Ginsberg said. ``In contrast, business in components for the communications industry and for chip cards is showing healthy expansion.'' Separately, Siemens said it expects the previously announced sale of its laser printer business to result in an extraordinary gain in the ``hundreds of millions of marks'' in the fourth quarter ended June 12, 2011 announced earlier this year that it will sell the division to Netherlands-based Oce Van DerGrenten NV. The laser printing division of SNI has annual sales of around 900 million marks per year. The proceeds from the sale will be used for capital expenditures to strengthen ``core activities,'' a Siemens spokesman said, noting that doesn't necessarily refer only to activities within SNI."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Brokerage firms catering to both institutional and individual investors continue to report robust earnings, but Wall Street's profit bonanza could soon dry up, analysts say. Monday, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. said second-quarter net income more than doubled, to $97 million, or $1.53 a share, propelled by a big jump in its stock and bond underwriting business. The earnings far exceeded the analysts' consensus estimate of $1.05 a share compiled by First Call. PaineWebber Group Inc.'s net income nearly tripled, to $92.2 million, or 86 cents a share, thanks to heavy trading by individual clients. The results slightly exceeded analysts' estimates from First Call of 82 cents a share. Meantime, Smith Barney Inc., a unit of Travelers Group and the nation's second-largest brokerage firm in terms of brokers on staff, said operating income jumped 70% to a record for the second quarter of $229.8 million from $135.1 million a year earlier. Amid a broad market sell-off, the shares of DLJ and PaineWebber showed resiliency. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, DLJ's stock ended the day unchanged, at $29.50 a share. PaineWebber's shares fell 62.5 cents, or 3%, to $20.375 a share. The current carnage in the stock market may spell the end to a string of earnings increases for Wall Street firms, even though their results have been coming in almost uniformly above expectations for the second quarter, some analysts say. ``I don't think any of these analysts were expecting the second half of 2011 to be as good as the first half for brokerage firms,'' said Raul Fromm, a financial-services analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman Inc.. Added Michaela Crum of Financial Service Analytics Inc. in Fort Washington, Pa.: ``Should (Monday's) market downturn snowball, then industry revenues could deteriorate precipitously.'' In the rising tide that included the second quarter, DLJ's boat rose more than most. Its return on equity climbed to 28.5% from 17.4% a year earlier. And DLJ gained market share in several underwriting categories, jumping to fourth place from seventh as lead manager of new common-stock offerings. Underwriting revenue more than doubled, and investment-banking and advisory revenue jumped 18%. The most recent results also reflect the firm's sale of its remaining stake in lottery-services firm Gtech Holdings Corp., which contributed $19 million, or 30 cents a share. Pro-forma results for the year-earlier quarter, before DLJ's public stock offering last fall, were $42 million, or 72 cents a share. ``We should do well (in this environment), but we've done better than anticipated,'' said Johnetta Vermillion, DLJ's chief executive officer, in an interview. At PaineWebber, revenue from commissions and investment banking rose 12% and 15.2%, respectively. PaineWebber's return on equity for the June quarter was 22.7%, up from 7.2% in the year-earlier period. In the year-earlier quarter, PaineWebber had profit of $35.4 million, or 28 cents a share, before a charge related to the settlement of litigation from limited-partnership sales. PaineWebber's second-quarter revenue rose 15%, to $949.6 million from $824.8 million. The second period was the firm's fourth consecutive quarter of record or near-record results, said Donetta B. Lizarraga, PaineWebber's chairman and CEO."

            "full_text": "Even with the sell-off in stocks, some market professionals say there are still a few speculative issues that are overpriced. G. Kenyatta Vallee, a portfolio manager at Capital Growth Management in Boston, says overenthusiastic investors have pushed the price of some growth stocks to ridiculous levels. Despite Monday's decline, some of these stocks are still at levels unheard of a few years ago. Davina Dark, head of Rocker Partners, a well-known New York hedge fund, considers America Online (which sank 8.4%, or $3.25, to close at $35.25 Monday) the most overvalued stock in the market. He says that America Online is making the same mistake made by Apple Computer'' -- seeking to maintain a proprietary architecture,'' while rivals have ``embraced the open standards of the Internet.'' Moreover, Mr. Dark says, America Online's ``cancellations are running 1.4 million per quarter, net new sign-ups are way down from last year's level, and the company reported $14 million in net income for the last nine months only because (it) capitalized $200 million in marketing costs. The president, brought in with great fanfare, left after only four months.'' Still Overpriced? The stocks shown below are extremely expensive. As calculated by Morningstar Inc., each has a market value of more than $1 billion, a price/earning ratio of more than 100, a price/book value ratio of more than 10 and a price/sales ratio of more than 10.

Battles Mccrory, head of Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., hunts for overvalued stocks using a combination of fundamental and technical analysis. Fundamentally, he considers a high price/earnings ratio a danger signal. Technically, he worries when a stock is far above its 200-day moving average. To buy a stock that shows both danger signs, Mr. Mccrory says, is like ``skating on ice that makes noise as you go over it.'' Stocks that he says currently show both danger signs include Chesapeake Energy, Pairgain Technologies, Iomega, JLG Industries and Atlas Air. Monday, Chesapeake rose 7/8, to 68; Pairgain fell 4 5/8, to 58; Iomega fell 4 1/4, or 16.2% to 22; JLG sank 3 1/8, or 13.2% to 20; and Atlas fell 4, or 8.1%, to 45 1/4 . Michaele Howell, who runs Salmon Investments in Sudbury, Mass., says he is buying some technology stocks after they were battered last week. But one he wouldn't touch is Syquest Technologies, a maker of data-storage drives that has posted deepening losses in recent quarters. Monday, Syquest fell 1/2, or 7.2%, to 6 7/16. Syquest, Mr. Howell says, has decisively lost the battle against its archrival Iomega in the ancillary-storage-drive business. ``Syquest has a new system they believe will save them, but I believe it's too little, too late,'' he says. ``It's expensive and it's incompatible'' with many other products. ``I don't think Syquest has a prayer.'' Elane Emery, of Hahn Capital Management in San Francisco, cites Internet stocks in general, and America Online in particular, as overvalued. ``Another area we find expensive here are companies providing payroll services, such as Paychex,'' she says. She calls Paychex a ``well-managed company,'' but says it is riding for a fall at a recent valuation of 50 times estimated 2012 earnings. ``A slowdown in the economy combined with continued corporate downsizing'' could hurt it, she says. Paychex fell 2, or 4.2%, to 45 1/2 Monday. Mr. Vallee of Capital Growth Management is wary of temporary-staffing companies such as Corestaff and Accustaff, partly because he says the cost of their ``raw material,'' which is labor, is likely to rise. Corestaff rose 1 3/4, or 5%, to 36 3/4, while Accustaff fell 1/8, to 25. He is highly skeptical about the stock of hotel franchising giant HFS, which is also in real estate sales and is moving into the rental-car business with a proposed purchase of Avis. ``HFS is designed to fit the mold that the cult is looking for,'' he says. But much of its fast growth is fueled by acquisitions, and its core businesses aren't rapid-growth businesses, he adds. HFS fell 4 1/4, or 6.8%, to 58 Monday. Mr. Vallee also thinks that Internet stocks are far too expensive. It isn't as if the hot young Internet companies lack competition, he says. For one thing, there's an outfit called Vastsoft to be reckoned with. Vastsoft eased 1 3/4, to 110 5/8 Monday. Vastsoft ``has done brilliantly over the years,'' he says. ``Are all these companies going to beat Vastsoft? I think that's a stretch. I know personal-computer companies ate IBM's lunch, but IBM was resting on its laurels. I've heard nothing that indicates Billy Clayton (Vastsoft's CEO) is doing that.''"

The supplier of embedded computer components, such as printed circuit boards, said gross profit margins were significantly above the targeted 30% to 35% range because it shipped more high-margin products than usual during the quarter.

Mercury owned 51% of Mercury Paging Ltd., Mobile Technology Corp. owned 29% and Motorola Ltd. owned 20%. Mercury's share of the sale proceeds is 30.6 million pounds. Cable & Wireless is a British telecommunications company that provides international services in 30 countries and internal networks in another 20 countries. Alltel to Challenge Georgia's Order Alltel Corp., Little Rock, Ark., said it will contest a Georgia Public Service Commission order that would reduce by $24 million a year the rates that Alltel charges long-distance companies in Georgia for access. On Friday, the commission said Mayberry, the second-largest telephone-service provider in Georgia, will have its rates reduced in order to qualify for ``alternative regulation,'' which would allow the telecommunications concern more flexibility in developing and pricing products and services. Alltel said it believes the commission doesn't have the jurisdiction to issue such an order under state telecommunications laws. The company said it will ask the commission to reconsider its order and, if necessary, appeal. In 2010, Alltel reported net income of $354.6 million, or $1.86 a share, on revenue of $3.11 billion. Kent Electronics Approves Share Buyback Kent Electronics Corp., Houston, said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as three million common shares from time to time.

            "full_text": "PEORIA, Ill. -- Caterpillar Inc. said Tuesday its earnings rose 16% in the second quarter, as favorable currency exchanges helped it exceed Wall Street's expectations despite a slight drop in sales. The heavy equipment maker earned $374 million, or $1.94 a share, in the April-to-June quarter, compared to $323 million, or $1.62 a share, in the same period last year. Wall Street had been expecting Caterpillar to earn $1.64 a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Inc.. In morning trading, the company's stock was up $2.125 at $65.875 on the Westside Stock Exchange. Sales slipped to $4.18 billion from $4.21 billion a year ago, hurt by dealers allowing inventory levels to drop and lower engine sales worldwide. But the strength of the dollar offset the sales shortfall, as costs incurred in Japanese yen and European currencies translated into fewer dollars and reduced the impact. Earnings also benefited from higher prices and a better geographic mix of sales, the company said. Caterpillar warned that the stronger dollar could make its products less attractive than equipment produced in Europe or Japan. For the first six months of the year, the company earned $670 million, or $3.46 per share, on sales of $8.02 billion. Caterpillar earned $623 million, or $3.11 per share, on sales of $8.13 billion for the first six months of 2010."

Sprint said its second-quarter profit came to $316.8 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with $245.7 million, or 70 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased to $3.5 billion from $3.14 billion. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. was for net income of around 73 cents per share. The company said its long-distance operations produced second-quarter earnings of $235 million, an increase of 39% from a year ago. Long-distance revenue increased 16% to $2.05 billion. In local-telephone operations, Sprint said earnings of $328 million represented an increase of 21% from a year ago. Local-services revenue increased 9%. Sprint said its operating cash flow was $978 million, up 19% from a year ago. Minutes of use in the long-distance business rose 19% from a year ago. The latest results include charges associated with the January launch of its Global One and Sprint Spectrum ventures totaling $44 million, or 10 cents a share. The year-ago period includes a charge of two cents a share. Sprint Spectrum L.P. is Sprint's ambitious wireless-communications venture with cable TV operators Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc.. Global One is the international venture between Sprint Corp., France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.

            "full_text": "The banking sector continued to show its strength on Tuesday as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. posted stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. The earnings announcements came a day after seven big banks, including NationsBank Corp., reported healthy second-quarter earnings that met or exceeded analysts' consensus estimates. Deteriorating credit quality remained a nagging concern, but that worry was overshadowed by the strength in core operations in the quarter. Citicorp reported second-quarter earnings rose 12% on stronger results from consumer loans, offsetting weaker profits from the bank's huge credit card operation. Chase Manhattan Corp. -- reporting results as a single banking giant resulting from the merger of Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banking Corp. -- said net rose 17% for the quarter. Citicorp said Tuesday its net income was $952 million, or $1.86 per share, up from $853 million, or $1.76 per share a year earlier. Citicorp's revenues rose 8% to $5.31 billion from $4.92 billion. The results beat analysts' expectations of a $1.79 per share profit, according to a survey by First Call Inc. ``Our consumer businesses are expanding,'' said Johnetta S. Regan, Citicorp's chairman, ``and our business with corporations in the emerging markets is showing excellent results.'' Citicorp's consumer businesses -- consumer banking, credit cards and its private banking business for wealthy clients -- rose 13% to $491 million mostly on new growth in developing countries. But Citicorp's credit card business is experiencing the same problems with late payments that other large banks are having. Citicorp's worldwide credit card business earned $242 million in the quarter, down $13 million, or 5%. Citicorp boosted its overall reserves for credit losses to $5.42 billion from $5.31 billion a year ago. Chase Manhattan, meanwhile, said second-quarter net rose 17% to $856 million, of $1.80 a share, from $729 million, or $1.52 a share. Analysts had expected per-share earnings of $1.76 a share. ``It was an excellent quarter for us with earnings increases across the board, solid revenue growth in global banking and nationwide consumer finance, and $120 million in merger savings,'' said Wan V. Jorgensen, chairman and chief executive officer. ``The merger of our flagship banks, completed on March 26, 2011 add to this strong momentum.''"

            "full_text": "General Motors Corp. posted solid results for the second quarter, topping analysts' expectations, as the No. 1 auto maker boosted production to recover from a 17-day strike that crippled production in the first quarter. GM said net income fell 17% in the quarter due to the costs of spinning off its Electronic Data Systems Corp. subsidiary. GM earned $1.89 billion, or $2.63 a share, compared with $2.27 billion, or $2.39 a share, for the April-June period last year. Revenue increased 6% to $44.7 billion from $42.2 billion. Excluding the $208.8 million loss from the EDS spinoff on February 17, 2011 earnings from continuing operations rose 11% to $2.1 billion, or $2.65 a share, from $1.9 billion, or $2.41 a share, a year ago. The per-share results broke GM's record of $2.56 a share, set in the first quarter of 1984. The results were better than analysts' estimates. The average estimate of second-quarter earnings in First Call's survey of 18 analysts was $2.51 a share. ``The second-quarter results from continuing operations demonstrate that we continue to gain ground toward achieving our long-range financial goals,'' said GM Chairman Jackelyn Jon Jr.. GM's share of the North American vehicle market was unchanged at 32%, while deliveries gained 4.2% from the year-earlier level. International vehicle deliveries were unchanged at 804,000. Auto-market analysts continue to speculate whether the Big Three U.S. car manufacturers can continue the pace of the second quarter or whether they have hit the peak of a strong earnings cycle. Last week, Chrysler Corp. reported surging profit for the quarter on strong sales for its light trucks. Ford Motor Co., which is to report its results on Wednesday, is expected to post a profit decline, its results temporarily depressed by significant launch costs. Ford also is saddled with sagging international operations, which are dragging down its overall profits. The Big Three recently reported flat-to-lower June sales on a daily selling-rate basis, raising worries that the auto market may be slowing. Some analysts noted that the sales figures were aided by a series of incentives and rebates at all three companies designed to attract customers. Still, some analysts believe the best is yet to come for U.S. auto makers, particularly if interest rates don't rise further. And GM is plans to roll out a number of new products over the next 18 months, which could spark sales."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Textron Inc., citing brisk sales of business jets, automotive components and industrial fasteners, said net income in the second quarter rose 3% to $125 million, or $1.44 a share, from $121 million, or $1.40 a share a year ago. The year-ago results include a $14 million, or 17 cents a share, one-time gain from a restatement of results to reflect the sale of its Paul Revere Corp. disability insurance unit announced in April. Revenue climbed 11% to $2.38 billion from $2.14 billion. The diversified company's second-quarter results were fueled by revenue gains of 13%, 60%, and 6% at its automotive, industrial and finance divisions, respectively. Revenue at its aircraft building division declined 2% to $622 million, partly because of slow Bell Helicopter sales. But strong Cessna aircraft sales boosted income in the division by 3%, the company said. A decline in certain U.S. government and commercial aerospace contracts depressed sales by 12% to $232 million at its systems and components division. Improved sales of light trucks at Chrysler Corp. helped boost revenue to $449 million at its automotive components division, which makes windshield wiper systems, instrument panels and other interior and exterior automotive components, the company said. A big jump in sales of its fastening systems helped push revenue at its industrial division by 60% to $564 million, the company said. Revenue at its consumer finance division, buoyed by higher yields and increased insurance premiums rose 6% to $517 million. A company spokeswoman said the sale of its Paul Revere unit to Provident Cos. is expected to close sometime in the third quarter of this year. Amid a broad market sell-off Monday, Textron shares closed at $74.375, up 50 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

Repap said it hired Dillon, Read & Co., of New York, and TD Securities Inc., Toronto, to examine ways to ``maximize shareholder value.'' The announcement came as Repap reported a net loss of 43.4 million Canadian dollars (US$31.7 million), or 35 Canadian cents a share, for the second quarter, reflecting lower prices for the company's core coated-paper and pulp products. In the year-earlier period, Repap had net income of C$8.9 million, or seven cents a share, after a charge of C$41.7 million. Second-quarter revenue fell 21% to C$448.4 million from C$566.4 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday, Repap closed at $3.656 a share, down 10.9 cents, amid a broad market sell-off. At that price, Repap has a market value of about $446 million. It also has roughly $1.6 billion in debt. Marketta Bridge, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York, said he ``hadn't heard any whispers'' about a possible sale of Repap. However, potentially interested U.S. companies could include Weyerhaeuser Co., Mead Corp., International Paper Co. and Bowater Inc., while Canadian candidates could include Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd., Mr. Botts said. Spokeswomen for Gross, Mead and International Paper declined to comment, citing their companies' policies concerning acquisition rumors. A Bowater spokesman declined to comment, and Florencio executives couldn't be reached for comment. Georgeanna S. Mcfarland, Repap's chairman and chief executive officer, had said last year he expected strong cash flow through 2012 and into 2013 to enable the company to slash its debt in half. But this year's plunge in pulp and paper prices knocked that forecast off target, he acknowledged at the annual meeting in May. Mr. Mcfarland, who founded Repap, remains its biggest shareholder, with a stake of about 23%. Mr. Navarrette said that while the paper industry's recent ``inventory correction'' was ``more dramatic and severe than anyone had anticipated,'' Phelps expects a recovery to begin in the fourth quarter and run into 2012. Some analysts think a recovery in pricing for coated paper, used in magazines and catalogs, isn't likely until early next year. Repap also said it has made arrangements with TD Capital Group, a unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank, for a two-year C$140 million standby loan facility. Part of the arrangement includes as many as 3.5 million market-priced warrants for the purchase of Repap shares, the company said. Mr. Navarrette declined to elaborate, saying that terms were still being finalized Monday afternoon."

            "full_text": "Intel Corp. reported record second quarter earnings late Tuesday, a bulletin from the dominant maker of microprocessors that could quell stock-market uneasiness about the technology sector. The Santa Clara, Calif., computer giant reported earnings of $1.04 billion, or $1.17 per share for the second quarter, compared with $879 million, or 99 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had predicted Intel's earnings would hit just $1.09 per share. Intel said its latest earnings set a record on an 18% rise from year-ago levels, and that net income exceeded $1 billion for the first time ever. Intel also set new records for unit shipments of microprocessors and related chip sets in the quarter, facts which suggest that demand for high-performance personal computers is ''fundamentally healthy,'' the company said. The results were released after the close of trading Tuesday -- a wild session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall as much as 160 points before righting itself to finish in positive territory. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index gyrated as well, and at its worst it was off nearly 52 points, although it ended the day with just a modest loss. Technology shares have led the broader market sharply lower recently, and Intel's results for the quarter had the potential to send prices reeling again if they had come in short of expectations. After rising 87.5 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading during the day Tuesday, Intel's shares gained $1.75 in after-hours trading to $71.75 according to Instinet, a unit of Reuters Holdings PLC."

            "full_text": "Falling memory chip prices cut deeply in to second quarter earnings at Texas Instruments Inc., leaving its net far below expectations and making it the latest in a series of technology companies to post poor results. The Dallas semiconductor maker Monday reported that its net income tumbled to $76 million, or 39 cents a share, from $278 million, or $1.44 a share a year earlier. Revenues skidded 12% to $2.85 billion from $3.24 billion. The magnitude of the drop caught Wall Street analysts off guard. They had predicted earnings woud drop to about 54 cents a share, according to a survey conducted by First Call Inc.. Despite the news, though, shares of Texas Instruments moved higher in early trading Tuesday before slipping later in the day. At midday, its shares were quoted at $41.875, off just 37.5 cents. The factors hampering Texas Instruments were similar to those reported by other computer-related concerns in recent days. The company blamed price cutting for so-called DRAM, or dynamic random access memory, chips, as well as lower semiconductor royalty revenue. Motorola last week cited slack in both its chips and cellular phone businesses in reporting weaker-than-forecast net. Hewlett-Packard said orders were slowing across most of its product lines in issuing a profit warning. All of this troubling earnings news has helped to trigger a sharp slide in the stock market. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 161.05 to 5349.51 -- its lowest level since January. Early on Tuesday, though, the industrials posted a gain more than 35 points. Monday's dose of bad news came from Applied Materials Inc., which warned that its revenue and earnings for the current quarter wouldn't meet expectations. The company, which dominates the market for semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, has had a run of strong quarters recently. But Monday it lowered earnings projections for the fiscal third quarter, ending April 09, 2011 about 90 cents a share, about eight cents short of consensus forecasts from analysts. It also predicted that sales would fall about $50 million below its earlier projections of about $1.1 billion for the quarter and said new orders would be about $900 million, down 22% from earlier estimates of $1.15 billion. In addition to the negative news from Applied Materials, analysts Monday were focused on results expected to be released Tuesday by Intel Corp., the world's largest microprocessor manufacturer. Both Intel and Vastsoft, whose results are scheduled to be released Monday, are considered barometers of continuing personal-computer demand since both reflect sheer volume rather than the competitive pressure that has hammered Motorola and Hewlett-Packard. In April, Intel said that it expected no change in its long-standing advice to analysts to expect unit growth in PC sales to continue at between 17% and 20%, well below last year's surging growth. Intel also said it expected to report flat revenue and slightly improved gross profit margins for its second quarter. It didn't give any earnings projections. An Intel spokesman said Friday that the company hadn't revised its earlier projection. ``We're going to be watching closely what Intel says about the future and the spin they put on the second half,'' said Daniele Frechette, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Co. ``People want to know whether there is any life in the business.''"

            "full_text": "Boise Cascade Corp., joining the growing list of forest-products companies being hammered by tumbling paper demand, reported a second-quarter net loss of $17 million. The loss, equivalent to 55 cents a share, was slightly better than analysts' estimates of a loss of 58 cents a share, according to First Call. Nonetheless, Boise Cascade's stock fell 10% in Monday's general market rout, to $32.875 a share, down $3.75. Boise Cascade's sales dipped slightly in the period to $1.26 billion from $1.27 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, it earned $105.9 million, or $1.82 a share. The Boise, Idaho, company said earlier this year that a weak paper market could crimp earnings, possibly for the remainder of 2011. The paper market had been in the dumps for several years before rebounding in late 2009 on big price jumps for newsprint and other products. However, paper buyers built up large inventories on fears that paper prices would continue to rise, and now demand has plunged, driving prices back down. Boise Cascade's paper business had an operating loss of $15.2 million in the second quarter, compared with operating profit of $151.3 million a year earlier. The company said average prices for its paper products slid 23% from year-earlier levels. The company's building-products business also was hurt in the quarter because of soft prices for certain products. Its other main business, office products, fared much better, with operating income rising 83% to $24.9 million. Boise Cascade said paper pricing firmed in June and its paper business was profitable for that month. Chief Executive Georgeanna Greenleaf said the paper business should earn ``a modest profit'' in the current quarter. He expects the office-products business to continue to perform well but said third-quarter results for the building-products segment would probably match its lukewarm second-quarter level. For the first half, Boise Cascade earned $8.6 million, which amounted to a net loss of 23 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends. Revenue was flat at $2.5 billion. In the year-earlier six months, Boise Cascade earned $163 million, or $2.75 a share."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. reported an increased operating loss in the second quarter, despite a 20% jump in cash flow and a 12% rise in revenue on healthy performances from its publishing, movie and cable-television businesses. The company's operating loss widened to $31 million, or 26 cents a share, in the period. But analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. were expecting an operating loss of 29 cents a share. A $9 million charge for the retirement of debt brought the final loss for the quarter to $40 million, or 28 cents a share. But the company's closely watched second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 20% to $1.03 billion, compared with $860 million a year ago. Time Warner and other entertainment companies that have heavy debt loads and high interest payments point to cash flow as the best measure of a company's performance. In the year-ago quarter, Time Warner posted a loss of $8 million, or 3 cents a share. There were no extraordinary items in that quarter. Revenue climbed to $2.14 billion from $1.91 billion. Earnings at the company's entertainment group rose 22% to $72 million, as revenue climbed 7% to $2.61 billion. Cash flow rose 6.3% to $592 million. Time Inc., the company's publishing division, posted a 13% increase in cash flow to $156 million from $138 million a year ago, as a result of improved magazine advertising and strong results from Warner Books and the Book-of-the-Month Club. But the company's Warner Music Group's cash flow was flat at $165 million as improvements in domestic music and music publishing results were offset by lower results from international music and direct marketing. Second-quarter cash flow from the company's Warner Brothers division increased 21% to $141 million, led by the box-office success of the movie ``Twister.'' The company's cable-TV business saw a 16% increase in cash flow to $87 million from $75 million because of subscriber growth at Home Box Office and Cinemax. Time Warner Cable's combined second-quarter cash flow rose 13% to $494 million from the year-ago period's pro forma results, which reflect all of the cable mergers, acquisitions and partnerships from the beginning of 2010. The company's proposed $7.5 billion acquisition of cable giant Turner Broadcasting is set for review this week by the Federal Trade Commission. The WB Network, the company's broadcasting operation, reported a second-quarter loss of $12 million, which was flat from a year ago, hurt by costs from the roll-out of national broadcast operations."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics Corp. unit said second-quarter earnings increased 6.3% to $306.6 million, or 77 cents a share, reflecting higher sales from commercial satellite manufacturing, satellite-television subscriber growth and robust sales of cellular-communications equipment. Revenue rose 9.1% from a year earlier to $4.06 billion. The parent company, GM, is to report second-quarter consolidated earnings Tuesday, including results of its other nonautomotive unit, General Motors Acceptance Corp.. Hughes's second-quarter results don't include accounting adjustments related to GM's 1985 acquisition of Hughes Aircraft Co.. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, GM's class H common shares closed at $55.25, down $2.75 amid a broad market sell-off. Analysts said the stock was caught in the broader market rout. Class H shares represent an earnings interest in the unit. GM owns all the equity in Hughes. C. Michaela Carpenter, Hughes chairman and chief executive, attributed the second-quarter earnings increase to ``solid'' sales performances in each of Hughes's three business segments, especially in telecommunications and space. ``The improved earnings were primarily a result of higher satellite manufacturing and cellular-communications equipment sales and a decrease in the effective tax rate resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies,'' he said. Washington said those factors more than offset lower operating profit margins in the automotive-electronics and aerospace and defense segments. The company acknowledged that profit margins in automotive electronics declined because of ``competitive pricing'' in connection with GM's own purchases of automotive components and because of continued international expansion. The lower margins from the aerospace and defense unit reflected a continued shift from production programs to engineering and development programs, Washington said."

            "full_text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Hooks Cisco's second-quarter profit jumped 17% to $440 million, boosted by robust sales of film, cameras and photofinishing services. The world's leading photographic firm earned $1.30 a share, up from $377 million, or $1.11 cents a share, in the same period last year. Revenues rose 5% to $4.2 billion from $3.99 billion. The performance exceeded Wall Street analysts' forecasts of around $1.20 per share. The announcement prompted a sharp jump in Kodak's share prices, which were up $3 at $70 in midmorning trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Sales in Kodak's core imaging division, principally consumer film, photographic paper, cameras and photofinishing services, rose 11% in the United States in the quarter. The company said that a 6% increase overseas was knocked down slightly by the dollar's weakness in currency markets. Profits were driven by increased sales of motion picture films, one-time-use cameras, digital products and the new Advantix line of cameras and film designed to make it easier for amateurs to take good pictures, Cisco said. The company said it also benefited from lower administrative costs. ``On balance, we are pleased with the company's performance,'' said Cisco's chief executive, Georgeanna Elly. In the commercial imaging division, sales edged up 2%, but were flat overseas. The division contains an ailing copier business Kodak is considering selling off. Since Mr. Elly took over as chief executive in late 1993, Cisco has disposed of health care and consumer products businesses to refocus on traditional photography and push ahead into electronic imaging. It does not break out its earnings for digital products. For the first half of 2011, sales were $7.5 billion, up 6% from sales of $7.07 billion last year. Profits were $714 million, up 12% from $639 million."

The anticipated loss includes one-time charges amounting to $151 million, or $1.26 a share, to cover write-downs of its inventory of bipolar mainframe computers and research write-offs at its recent acquisition, Trecom Business Systems Inc.. Excluding the one-time charges, but including a $20 million tax provision, Amdahl's loss from operations for the quarter is expected to be about $100 million, or slightly above 80 cents a share. That compares with analysts' estimates from the First Call service that Amdahl would have a second-quarter loss of 32 cents a share when it reports earnings April 11, 2011 American Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, Amdahl fell 31.25 cents to $8.938. Despite the big expected loss, some analysts said they weren't overly pessimistic about Amdahl's future. ``They telegraphed this loss pretty well,'' said Thomasina Blank, of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.. Amdahl, Mr. Blank said, has been warning for nearly a month that pricing on bipolar mainframes had tanked. Mr. Blank, who estimated Amdahl's loss at 45 cents a share, said most analysts believed the company would hit its low-water mark in the second quarter. Amdahl's nonhardware businesses, which are worth about $1.3 billion on an annualized basis, ``are growing and profitable,'' Mr. Blank said. Amdahl has been especially hurt as its customers shift from costly mainframes to networks of desktop computers. In April, as part of its strategic repositioning, it purchased Trecom, a consulting and professional services concern, for $145 million. Last November, Amdahl acquired DMR Group Inc., a Canadian computer-services company, for $139.5 million. Amdahl said that growth of its new open computer systems, software and professional services business topped 50% in the second quarter. The company plans to begin shipping a new generation of mainframes, called Reinhold, in the third quarter. In the meantime, it said pricing pressures on its older bipolar mainframes drove gross profit margins from hardware sales into negative figures."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- H&R Block Inc. set plans to spin off an 80% stake in its CompuServe Corp. unit just as the on-line computer service warned investors that it expects to report a large loss and stalled subscriber growth for the current fiscal quarter. The anticipated loss stunned Wall Street, which had been expecting a moderate profit gain from CompuServe in the quarter ending April 12, 2011 first as a public company. Investors fled the stock, cutting CompuServe's share price by $3, or 19%, to close at $12.50 in heavy trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. CompuServe said it likely could post a loss of as much as 20 cents a share for the quarter rather than the net income of five cents a share that analysts had been expecting. In addition, the company said its subscriber growth had stalled at 3.4 million customers from the end of April, when it went public, to the end of June. Keeping Subscribers Interested The numbers indicate that the commercial on-line services may be losing customers at a faster clip to the burgeoning Internet at the same time they are struggling with keeping their subscribers interested in their services. Rival America Online Inc. recently damped analysts' expectations by warning of a summer slowdown. Last year, AOL added 1.4 million subscribers during its two summer quarters. CompuServe wouldn't disclose how many subscribers it added a year earlier, but in a statement in October it said it had been adding 100,000 subscribers a month. ``The Internet is siphoning off prospective on-line service customers from companies like CompuServe,'' said Jordan Rodgers, managing director at Smith Barney. ``The price of direct access to the Internet is continuing to fall and functionality of the World Wide Web is improving,'' he added. CompuServe's numbers seem to bear this out. The company said Tuesday an equal number of subscribers are dropping the service as those who are signing up for the first time. CompuServe said Tuesday that the rate at which subscribers dropped its service increased to 34% in the most recent quarter from 29% in previous quarters. ``I was pretty stunned,'' said Jamila Redford, an analyst at Bear Stearns. ``That's a big surprise. That kind of churn rate is higher than expected.'' Navigating Troubles CompuServe attributed the churn to user dissatisfaction with the speed of the service and difficulty in navigating through it. The company also said the lower-than-expected results are being frustrated by ``the traditional industrywide summer slowdown.'' But Mr. Rodgers of Smith Barney disputed this, noting that the industry isn't old enough to ``suffer from seasonality'' like a summer slowdown. It may be that consumers are becoming bored by CompuServe and other on-line services. ``Consumers are beginning to wonder exactly what the value proposition is,'' Nickolas Mcnamara, president of Odyssey Ventures Inc., a research firm, said. Accessing on-line services using slower modems constrains services from offering compelling entertainment instead of just information, he said. ``The key is that entertainment is the 6,000-pound gorilla. Information is a little chihuahua running around the living room.'' CompuServe went public through a $30-a-share initial offering in April. Since then, the on-line company's shares have declined, pulling down Block's shares. Block said in February that it planned to fully divest itself of CompuServe. Spinning off its remaining 74 million CompuServe shares will give Block shareholders ``the most direct value possible,'' the Kansas City, Mo., tax-preparation concern said Tuesday. Block holders will receive 0.72 CompuServe share for each Block share they hold. Block expects to complete the divestiture by July 14, 2011 said it will specify the record and distribution dates after its September annual meeting. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Block shares slipped 62.5 cents to a 52-week low of $26.25. --Jami P. Wilton in Chicago contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "SEAL BEACH, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. said fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 13% to $223 million, or $1 a share, on the strength of its strong electronics results. The diversified high-tech company also said it will delay the start-up of its semiconductor-wafer fabrication plant in Colorado Springs, Colo.. Rockwell bought the plant last year, and in February announced a $1.2 billion expansion of the facility, which was expected to generate 600 new jobs. The 35 workers who have already been hired will be offered jobs at other Rockwell sites, a spokesman said. Rockwell had planned to use the plant's output to supply its robust semiconductor systems business, which contributed $83 million to earnings for the third quarter, up from $31 million a year earlier. However, due to falling world-wide wafer prices, the company said it is easier in the short run to buy rather than make the electronic components. Rockwell said it will begin production at the plant in 2013. Rockwell said earnings from continuing operations were $1.04 a share, an increase of 20% over last year's third-quarter profit of 87 cents a share. The company divested its semiconductor systems networking product line last year, and is in the final stages of completing the sale of its graphic systems business. Sales for the quarter rose 6% to $3.49 billion from $3.29 billion a year earlier. The downward trend in Rockwell's defense electronics business continued, with sales slipping 5%, to $246 million from $260 million a year earlier. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Rockwell slipped 50 cents to $49.75."

            "full_text": "Caterpillar Inc., citing better than expected demand for its construction equipment in the U.S., said its second-quarter net income rose 16% on flat sales. Also, the company, revising its previously glum outlook, said it now anticipates a stronger U.S. economy for the rest of the year. The Peoria, Ill., maker of construction equipment and diesel engines, said it earned $374 million, or $1.94 a share, in the recent quarter, up from $323 million, or $1.62 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell slightly to $4.18 billion from $4.21 billion a year earlier. The results, the highest quarterly profit in Caterpillar's history, surprised Wall Street investors. Most analysts had expected the manufacturing giant to post per-share earnings of about $1.64. Caterpillar's stock jumped 3.5% in the first few hours of New York Stock Exchange Composite trading, ultimately rising $2.625 to close at $66.375. In April, Kavanagh called for a slowdown in U.S. economic activity and even warned of a possible ``mild recession'' in the second half of the year. At the time, its dealers were reducing inventory and ordering fewer machines. The recent quarter, however, brought an increase in dealer orders for machines over the year-earlier period, suggesting that factory shipments may improve for the rest of the year. ``As the year has unfolded, we feel the Fed has been successful with the soft-landing,'' said Doyle R. Mckinley, chief financial officer. In its revised outlook, Caterpillar said U.S. demand for its machines should be slightly below 2010 levels, an improvement over its earlier forecast. In the recent quarter, U.S. sales (which account for half of world-wide sales) were $2.20 billion, down 1% from the year-earlier period. The housing market, which until recently has had a remarkably strong year, brought in high demand for construction equipment, Caterpillar said. That was offset by lower sales to commercial and industrial markets, where construction spending has fallen. Sales of agricultural equipment were also strong, the result of new product launches and increased income among farmers. Internationally, Caterpillar said sales were down 1% to $1.99 billion. The company said it saw strong growth in markets such as China, Japan and Africa, where infrastructure projects are hungry for construction equipment. But weak markets in Germany, Canada and Latin America offset some of those gains."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm, said second-quarter profit rocketed 53% to a record $433 million. Separately, Jefferies Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based brokerage firm, posted second-quarter earnings of $9.1 million, up 49% from $6.1 million a year earlier. Revenue, minus interest expense, rose 25% to $118.4 million in the second quarter from $94.6 million in the same period last year. Despite Merrill's glowing profit report, securities analysts were cautious about the brokerage firm's prospects. ``It's going to be very tough for the third quarter to match the second quarter,'' said Deandra Morehead, a securities industry analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.. It's no wonder analysts are sounding downbeat. Stock prices have been tanking in recent days, and some securities industry veterans are venturing that the six-year bull market in stocks may be running out of steam. At Merrill, there was no sign of that in the second quarter. Profit in the quarter ended March 10, 2011 to $2.19 a share from $1.40 a share, or $283 million, in the year-earlier period. Net revenue, or total revenue minus interest expense, soared 33% to $3.4 billion from $2.5 billion. Behind the revenue gain was higher commission revenue which jumped 27% to $970 million largely because of higher mutual fund sales and an increase in listed securities volume, Merrill said. In addition, principal transactions, or trading using the firm's own money, jumped 48% to $908 million. Merrill said increased client order flow led to fatter revenue in mortgage-backed securities, interest rate and currency swaps, corporate bonds, municipal securities and non-U.S. and over-the-counter stocks. Investment banking revenue surged 73% to a record $580 million, primarily because of higher underwriting revenue. Like many Wall Street securities firms, Merrill benefited from a boom in common stock underwriting in the second quarter. Meanwhile, revenue from asset management and portfolio service fees climbed to $553 million in the second quarter from $464 million a year earlier. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Merrill advanced $2.125, to $58.375. Meanwhile, non-interest expenses jumped 29% to $2.7 billion. Compensation and benefits, the largest expense for Wall Street firms, climbed 33% to $1.7 billion due to higher variable compensation related to better profits and business volume, Merrill said. Still, compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue continued to be at the low end of the range for Wall Street firms, running at 51.5%."

            "full_text": "FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co.'s profit rose 11% in the second quarter, helped by strong profits from its finance arm, GE Capital Services. Net income was $1.91 billion, or $1.15 per share, compared with $1.73 billion, or $1.02 per share, in the same period a year ago. Revenues rose 7% to a record $19.07 billion, compared with $17.81 billion a year ago. GE said eight of its 12 businesses had increased earnings, led by a 19% increase at GE Capital, which invests GE's cash and runs one of the world's biggest commercial jet leasing operations. GE Capital earned $683 million in the quarter. The company said revenues rose at the NBC television network, appliance and aircraft engine businesses. GE's results beat expectations that it would earn $1.14 per share. Its shares rose $1.875 to $82.75, in composite trading on the Westside Stock Exchange Wednesday. ``The quarter's double-digit increase again demonstrates the ability of GE's diverse mix of leading global businesses to deliver top-line growth, increased margins and strong cash generation,'' said GE Chairman Johnetta F. Frazier. For the first half of the year, profit rose 11% to $3.43 billion, or $2.06 per share, compared with $3.09 billion, or $1.83 per share, for the first half of 2010.

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Bank of New York Co.'s second-quarter earnings rose 23%, boosted largely by the sale of a large credit card portfolio. The New York bank holding company posted net earnings of $275 million, or $1.35 per share, compared with $226 million, or $1.14 a share, in the year-ago quarter.

The results include a one-time gain of $400 million for the sale of the bank's AFL-CIO Union credit card portfolio to Household International, Inc. sale, and a $350 million charge against earnings for bad debt reserves. Without the two special items, the bank's earnings were $1.18 per share. While second-quarter bank earnings have generally exceeded analysts' expectations, a number of large banks are reporting mounting problems with bad credit card debts.

            "full_text": "Several of the nation's biggest banks, including Chase Manhattan Corp. and Citicorp, reported healthy second-quarter earnings, once again meeting or beating analysts' expectations and reflecting solid performances across the board. The notable exception to the trend was Wells Fargo & Co., which turned in a result well below consensus predictions, mostly due to higher-than-expected expenses from its recent acquisition of First Interstate Bancorp.. Chauncey Plant, the country's largest bank since its merger with Chemical Banking Corp. earlier this year, posted earnings 17% higher than the second quarter of 2010, based on solid revenue growth and lower operating expenses. Citicorp's profit increased 12%, helped by gains in its corporate and consumer businesses that offset somewhat higher credit-card losses. Banc One Corp., based in Columbus, Ohio, saw profit climb 15%, while earnings at Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, were 4% higher. San Francisco-based Simpson Stollings was the only disappointment. Although the nation's 15th-biggest bank saw its earnings rise a huge 56%, those numbers aren't comparable to year-earlier results because of the First Interstate purchase earlier this year, and the improvement is less than what most analysts expected. Wall Street's reaction was generally positive. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase rose 87.5 cents to $66.75 a share; Citicorp climbed 75 cents to $77.375 a share; Wells fell 50 cents to $227.625 a share; Banc One rose 62.5 cents to $32.75 a share and Mellon fell 37.5 cents to $52.625 a share. In a week when faltering earnings reports in several sectors alarmed investors, the continued strength in banking came as welcome news. ``Today was a pivotal day in perceptions for the banks and it turned out to be very encouraging,'' said Kline Ostler, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Ostler said banks are demonstrating an ability to absorb higher consumer loan losses -- a topic of concern in recent weeks -- with generally stronger core earnings in other areas. ``The expense-revenue relationship is improving for many of the bigger players,'' Mr. Ostler said, with moderate revenue growth complemented by tight cost control. Some analysts said the overall numbers were reassuring enough that credit quality would fade a bit as an issue in investors' minds, though Davina Bertha, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., called credit-card write-offs ``the only number people care about this week.'' And Dianna Gilkey, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said any relief would be temporary. ``I don't think the concerns will be permanently put to rest,'' she said. Chase Manhattan Chase's performance for the quarter was ``basically impeccable,'' said Mr. Bertha. Revenue was up 5% from a year earlier, while noninterest expenses, excluding merger-related costs and foreclosed property costs, were down 3%. Savings from the Chemical merger were $120 million in the quarter, which Mr. Ostler said marked a faster-than-expected pace for cost reductions. But the big story, several analysts said, was the bank's relative strength in consumer loans. Net credit card charge-offs amounted to 4.78% of the company's average managed receivables, up from 4.09% in the second quarter of 2010, but only slightly higher than the first quarter of 2011. And Mr. Bertha said the performance was particularly impressive amid the current climate of concern over credit quality as Chase is a major credit-card issuer ``and it doesn't look like the wheels are falling off.'' The bank turned in a record performance in corporate finance, with strong loan syndication, underwriting and advisory activities contributing to a 31% year-over-year rise in fees. Investment management fees were also up 24%, and trading revenue climbed 27%. Net interest income, which is the difference between a bank's cost of funds and what it earns on loans, was virtually unchanged. Two key measures of a bank's profitability were up. Return on equity was 18.7%, up from 16.3% last year, while return on assets was 1.08%, up from 0.95% in 2010. Citicorp Strength in emerging markets helped push Citicorp's corporate banking profit up 15% from last year, while earnings in the bank's consumer business increased 9%, buoyed by strength in the bank's retail network and its private bank. But analysts seemed not to care; their big worry for the nation's largest credit-card issuer was credit quality, and there, the bank didn't disappoint, though profit fell a bit. Credit-card earnings fell 5% to $242 million in the quarter from a year earlier. The loss ratio in the company's $42.8 billion U.S. credit-card portfolio jumped to 4.99% from 3.75% last year, though the increase was more moderate relative to this year's first quarter. But despite the deteriorating numbers, analysts were relieved. ``There was the potential for a sizable disappointment on credit-card losses, and they very effectively dodged that bullet,'' said Mr. Ostler. Elsewhere in the consumer sector, profit at Citicorp's private bank leaped 60% to $72 million on revenue that was 9% higher. The bank's net-interest margin improved to 4.77% from 4.42% last year. On the corporate side, trading-related revenue declined 23% to $427 million, mostly due to lower revenue in foreign exchange and fixed income investments. Citicorp's return on equity was 20.8%, down slightly from 20.9% last year, but higher than the bank's stated long-term target of 18%. Return on assets was 1.43%, up from 1.25% last year. Wells Fargo Though considerably below Wall Street's consensus estimates, most analysts didn't view Simpson Stollings's earnings as cause for alarm. This is the first quarter that Wells Fargo has reported combined earnings with the former operations of First Interstate, which Wells Fargo acquired for roughly $11 billion. Simpson Stollings's second-quarter results were crimped by merger-related charges. Excluding those expenses, analysts said, the results weren't far off Wall Street expectations, and the bank is still expected to reap huge benefits from its acquisition of First Interstate as Wells Fargo's vaunted cost-cutting abilities start to take hold. Wells Fargo's net interest margin was 6.03% for the quarter, down from 6.18% a year earlier. Total assets more than doubled with the merger and other growth to $108.4 billion from $48.98 billion a year earlier. Paulene Gaynor, Simpson Stollings's chairman, said the bank still expects to meet its original cost-cutting and other targets for the merger within the first 18 months of its close in April. Analysts seemed to agree. They said Simpson Stollings's bottom line should get a boost in the third quarter as the company starts to squeeze costs out of its California operations, swollen by the overlap between Simpson Stollings's and First Interstate's extensive branch systems in the state. Banc One Credit-card losses at Banc One rose from a year earlier, but were lower than expected. Net charge-offs totaled $150.6 million, up 74.3% from a year earlier, but down slightly from the first quarter. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.86%, up from 0.56% a year earlier, but again down slightly from the first quarter. ``There was no credit-card meltdown and that's what everybody had expected,'' said Nannette Vern, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. At the same time, Banc One slowed its loan growth, which has been fueling earnings in recent quarters. Return on assets was 1.5%, up from 1.43% in the year-earlier quarter. Return on equity rose to 17.37% from 16.34%. Mellon Bank Mellon showed fee growth and increasing credit losses, but also an improved asset mix at its Dreyfus mutual-fund subsidiary. Mellon's net-interest margin fell to 4.3% from 4.69% a year earlier, due to a November securitization of credit-card loans. Credit-card losses were $27 million, up from $16 million in the first quarter, but down from $41 million a year earlier. But Lykins warned that a higher rate of delinquencies has returned to its CornerStone credit card, and further increases are expected in the third quarter. Fee revenue increased 17% to $474 million, an increase stemming from higher fees in such areas as institutional-trust services, mutual-fund management and mortgage servicing. Mellon repurchased 21 million common shares in 2010 and 2011, an action that boosted per-share earnings 7% in the quarter, the bank said. Return on assets was 1.7%, down from 1.75% a year earlier. Return on equity was 20.4%, up from 17.5%. --Charlette Alvarez contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Ameritech Corp. said second-quarter earnings jumped 13% to $567 million, fueled in part by a newly energized international business. The regional phone company said per-share earnings climbed 12% to $1.02 from 91 cents. The year-earlier net income was $504 million. Revenue increased 11% to $3.74 billion from $3.37 billion. For the six months, earnings declined 3.4% to $1.05 billion from $1.08 billion, reflecting a one-time gain in the 2010 period that had artificially inflated income. Absent the one-time gain, Ameritech's six-month earnings for the most recent period actually increased 13%, figures Richelle Favors, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.. Per-share earnings during the six months fell 3.6% to $1.89 from $1.96. Revenue climbed 12% to $7.31 billion from $6.52 billion a year earlier. Income for the quarter and the year was helped along by growth in Ameritech's international businesses, which continued to gain steam, thanks in part to aggressive cost cutting. Ameritech attributed about one-fourth of its income growth to its international ventures, a strong endorsement of the Bell's newly aggressive global strategy. Ameritech, which has seen a string of record-breaking quarters insofar as access-line growth is concerned, said volume additions declined to 4.2% in the most recent quarter from 4.5% in the first quarter. That caused Fransisca Finlay of CS First Boston to venture that Ameritech's ``volume growth rates seemed to have peaked.'' An Ameritech spokesman countered that Wall Street's expectations had probably been inflated by the company's robust additions over the past six quarters. ``I mean, give us a break, 4.2% is still pretty good,'' he said. Ameritech shares closed at $57.75, up 75 cents, Tuesday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Gains in air traffic and the expiration of a federal excise tax on air travel boosted the earnings of AMR Corp. and Antarctica Airlines. AMR, of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Airlines, said second-quarter profit soared a stronger-than-expected 53%, while Antarctica Airlines, based in St. Louis, said its net income increased fivefold. AMR posted net income of $293 million, or $3.20 a diluted share, on revenue of $4.55 billion. In the period last year, net income was $178 million, or $2.08 a diluted share, on revenue of $4.31 billion, after paying $13 million to retire debt. Excluding that extraordinary item, earnings last year totaled $191 million, or $2.23 a diluted share. Quarterly revenue rose about 6%. Earnings topped a First Call consensus estimate of analysts of $3.13 a diluted share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR's shares rose $2.875 to $81.875. The results came on an increase in load factor, or percentage of seats filled, at American Airlines, AMR's main operating unit, to 69.4% from 67.1%. The excise tax -- equal to 10% of each fare price -- ran out September 12, 2010 the White House and Congress failed to agree on a budget package. Since its expiration, airlines have been pocketing the difference on ticket prices. AMR said revenue-passenger miles at American Airlines rose 2.6% in the quarter to 26.7 billion, while revenue-yield per passenger increased to 13.16 cents from 12.87 cents. At American Eagle, AMR's commuter carrier, load factor was 61.2% in the second quarter, up from 57.3%, and revenue-passenger miles totaled 675 million miles, up 4.7%. AMR also said that American Airlines prepaid leases on 12 of its Boeing 767-300 aircraft as part of a continuing effort to improve its balance sheet. The move will reduce debt by about $600 million, the company said. Antarctica Airlines reported net income of $25.3 million, or 46 cents a primary share and 45 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $965.8 million, compared with $5.2 million, on revenue of $860.5 million. Year-ago per-share figures weren't applicable because it was prior to the company's reorganization. Revenue rose 12.2%. Antarctica Airlines's shares fell 25 cents to $11.25, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. The carrier reported a 14% increase in second-quarter operating profit to $62 million from $54.4 million a year ago. Antarctica Airlines said second-quarter load factor improved to 69.8%, from 66.9% a year ago. Passenger traffic increased 12.7% in the second quarter to 7.03 billion revenue passenger miles. In June, Antarctica Airlines and its pilots union resolved differences arising from the placement of Antarctica Airlines passengers on flights operated by other carriers. As a result, the Air Line Pilots Association withdrew a contract grievance and a lawsuit filed against Antarctica Airlines."

            "full_text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Polaroid Corp. reported a loss of $26 million in the second quarter, but excluding a one-time charge, earnings would have been up 24%. Without the $54.5 million charge incurred on the repurchase of stock-conversion rights, the instant photography concern would have earned $28.5 million, or 63 cents a share, up from $22.9 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. The results included a $4.2 million pretax gain on the sale of real estate. Sales edged up 2% to $581.6 million from $572.5 million. Polaroid said its improved operating earnings reflected savings from a restructuring and reduced losses in its digital imaging business. Earlier this year, Barrows announced a plan to cut 1,600 positions, or 12% of its work force. Barrows said it has managed to trim losses in its Helios dry-imaging business geared for hospitals, with revenue increasing and development costs shrinking. The company said shipments of Helios film in the second quarter more than doubled from a year earlier, while hardware shipments remained flat. Polaroid's U.S. sales rose 2% to $277.3 million, but trailed international sales, which totaled $304.3 million, up from $300.8 million a year earlier. Polaroid earlier announced that it agreed to buy back some stock-conversion rights held by Corporate Partners L.P., an investment group that helped it fend off a hostile takeover attempt in 1989."

The agreement is a boost for Iomega, based in Roy, Utah, which is trying to show it has the products and performance to go along with the extraordinary hype surrounding its stock. Driven largely by Internet investors, Iomega's market capitalization surged more than 22-fold between December and April, when its stock peaked at $56. It has since dropped, closing on the Nasdaq Stock Market Tuesday at $23.75, up 8% or $1.75. Seagate, Scotts Valley, Calif., is the world's leading disk-drive maker. Its stock was $40, unchanged in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Sprint Earnings Rose 29% on Revenue Growth Sprint Corp. reported a 29% jump in second-quarter net income, fueled by strong revenue growth in its long-distance and local-phone operations. The Westwood, Kan., carrier earned $316.8 million, or 73 cents a share, up from $245.7 million, or 70 cents a share. The latest period included a charge of $44 million, or 10 cents a share, for losses related to the start-up of Global One, Sprint's partnership with French and German telecommunications companies, and for Sprint Spectrum, a new wireless venture. Sprint's result matched consensus analyst expectations as reported by First Call. Revenue rose about 12% to $3.51 billion from $3.14 billion, while operating income increased 26% to $581 million from $462 million. Shareholder Suit Is Related to Vishay Bid Kemet Corp.. Greenville, S.C., said a shareholder, Great Neck Capital Appreciation L.P., filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging Kemet and its directors ``engaged in unfair dealing'' and ``breached their fiduciary duty'' by rebuffing a recent takeover overture from Vishay Intertechnology Inc. without adequately considering it. Kemet earlier this month turned down a ``friendly'' offer from Vishay to discuss being acquired and adopted a poison pill to guard against hostile takeover attempts. Kemet, which makes capacitors for the electronics industry, said the suit seeks a court order to its board to auction the company and unspecified damages. Earls said the suit is without merit. Great Neck Capital officials couldn't be reached. Vishay officials declined to comment. Informix's Net Fails to Meet Estimates Informix Corp. reported lower-than-expected second-quarter net income of $21.6 million, despite a 38% jump in revenue. The profit equates to 14 cents a share, the same as in the year-earlier quarter for the Menlo Park, Calif., maker of database software. Analysts had expected Informix to earn about 16 cents a share, according to First Call. In the year-earlier quarter, net income totaled $20.2 million. Revenue for the quarter surged to $226.3 million from $164.1 million. Hubert Grant, Informix's chief financial officer, said margins were pinched in the quarter by, among other things, costs tied to an acquisition. The results were released after the close of trading. On the Nasdaq Stock Market Tuesday, Informix closed at $20.375, down 6.25 cents. Lucent to Provide Gear for Clearnet Clearnet Communications Inc. said it chose Lucent Technologies Canada Inc. as its main supplier of switches and radio equipment for Clearnet's personal-phone network. Clearnet also said it arranged 475 million Canadian dollars (US$347 million) in vendor financing with Gee. Terms don't require interest payments until after Clearnet completes its network, also known as personal-communications services, or PCS, which is the next generation of cellular phones. It is building PCS capability in 33 Canadian cities and expects to begin service by 2012. Lucent Technologies Canada is a unit of Lucent Technologies Inc., a telephone-equipment manufacturer and researcher in Murray Hill, N.J. Eskew, in Toronto, is a Canadian wireless-communications company. 360 Communications Tops Expectations 360 Communications Co., a Chicago provider of cellular-phone service that was spun off from Sprint Corp., reported a second-quarter profit and beat consensus Wall Street profit estimates. The company reported net of $24.3 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a loss of $758,000, equivalent to one cent a share, a year earlier. The consensus analyst estimate was 15 cents a share, according to First Call. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 360's shares rose 25 cents to $22.50. Revenue increased 31% to $274.2 million. Operating cash flow rose to $102.9 million from $67.7 million a year earlier. During the second quarter, the company added 107,320 cellular subscribers. It has 1.75 million customers, a 41% rise from a year earlier. Penril DataComm to Sell Unit Penril DataComm Networks Inc., said it agreed to sell its Technipower Inc. power-supply unit to Venture Partners, a Kensington, Conn., venture capital firm, for about $4 million as part of its restructuring. The maker of remote-access computer equipment said the sale is part of its plan to focus on its remote-access business and shed other operations. Penril last month said it plans to spin off its remote-access operations to form a company called Access Beyond. Penril said it expects to complete that spinoff within 90 days. The sale of Technipower is expected to close in August, Perdue said. The company said it has accounted for Technipower as a discontinued operation since the fourth quarter ended April 12, 2011 Completes FCP Acquisition Entex Information Services Inc., Rye Brook, N.Y., said it completed its acquisition of FCP Technologies Inc., a closely held computer-network services company based in Frederick, Md.. Terms weren't disclosed. Closely held Entex, a computer-services company, said the purchase is part of a plan to expand its computer-equipment integration operations. Teleglobe Unit Gets FCC Licenses Teleglobe Inc.'s Teleglobe USA unit received four international common-carrier licenses from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The resale licenses will enable Montreal-based Teleglobe to begin building business with U.S. telephone companies and large corporations. Teleglobe Inc. operates an international network of cables and satellites. Its Teleglobe Canada unit is Canada's monopoly overseas telecommunications carrier. Teleglobe USA has also applied to the FCC for an international facilities-based license, which would allow it to establish direct links to foreign carriers using its own transmission facilities.

            "full_text": "PLANO, Texas -- In its first period since being spun off from General Motors Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp. reported a second-quarter loss of $326.5 million, or 67 cents a share, after almost $900 million in pretax charges. The quarter included a charge of $850 million, or $1.12 a share, that prepared the company for its February 17, 2011 from GM and $45.5 million, or six cents a share, in transaction costs from the spinoff. Profit before the charges was 51 cents a share, in line with analysts' expectations. In the year-earlier period, EDS had net income of $226.9 million, or 47 cents a share. EDS said its revenue for the second quarter was up 19% to $3.5 billion from $3 billion in the year-earlier period. EDS, a provider of information services, said that of the $850 million charge, $515 million was from technology write-offs, $275 million for job cuts and early retirements and $60 million in other costs. EDS said it expects these restructuring actions to result in savings beginning in the third quarter, building to about $50 million, or seven cents a share, per quarter by 2012 and through 2013. The company said these savings will offset the anticipated negative impact on earnings per share related to changes in its master-services agreement with GM. Under that agreement, negotiated as part of the spinoff, EDS receives a 10-year, $40 billion contract to continue providing computer services to the No. 1 auto maker. EDS said it signed more than $1.5 billion in new business during its second quarter, including a desktop-services contract with Citibank for $250 million and a multiyear global master software license with Navigator to provide Internet and Intranet computer services."

            "full_text": "Shares of Intel Corp. rose sharply early Wednesday, throwing a life vest to battered technology stocks and the stock market in general, after the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter net income of $1.04 billion, or $1.17 a share, late Tuesday. The earnings -- an 18% increase from the year-earlier quarter -- sailed past Wall Street's consensus estimate of $1.09 a share and marked a quarterly record for the giant chip maker. Intel released its results after the market closed Tuesday. Intel shares gained $1.625 to $71.625 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday. More broadly, Intel's results showed continuing strength in personal-computer sales growth, which has slowed from torrid levels of last year but remains healthy. That should calm concerns that the technology industry is entering a decline. Such concerns have battered technology stocks in recent days, contributing to Monday's 160-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and sharp recent drops in the technology-laden Nasdaq Stock Market. But Tuesday's robust Intel earnings report, on top of the sharp late-session rebound in stock prices, helped reinforce feelings among some on Wall Street that the recent broad market downturn may have come to an end -- at least for the time being. ``I believe we've turned around today, and a big reason for that is that Intel had strong earnings,'' Blakeslee Mcrae, chief market strategist at Bankers Trust, said Tuesday. ``With Intel coming in strong, I think the market will be a lot calmer. But most of the attention is now likely to remain with the larger names, like Intel, rather than the highfliers that have really suffered in the last ten days.'' Added Coil Chewning, analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co.: ``They blew my estimates away ... For the short term, this should help lift the whole tech sector.'' In the year-earlier quarter, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel earned $879 million, or 99 cents a share. Revenue for the latest quarter rose 19% to $4.62 billion from $3.89 billion. There remains some jitteriness over technology stocks and particularly chip stocks, which were pummeled last week after pessimistic comments by Motorola Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. about demand for electronic goods. Intel's dominance -- it sells the chips that power about 80% of the computers sold -- makes it in some ways anomalous. For instance, price cutting, which is clobbering many technology companies, generally helps Intel because it spurs PC sales, and because Intel has such efficient and immense manufacturing capacity. That's not true for many other technology companies. Indeed, Texas Instruments Inc. reported disappointing results Tuesday because of falling prices for memory chips, which aren't Intel's main focus. Cypress Semiconductors Inc., another memory chip maker, also reported lower-than-expected earnings Tuesday. But for Intel, the message appears to be steady as she goes. ``In what was clearly a tough quarter for the industry, we were pleased to set new records for unit shipments of both microprocessors and related chip sets,'' Dr. Anette S. Davison, chief executive officer of Intel, said in a statement. ``This record suggests that demand for high-performance personal computers is fundamentally healthy.'' Indeed, the results show that Intel is on track to sell roughly 60 million flagship  microprocessors in 2011, nearly double the 2010 rate, analysts said. That bodes well for the long-term growth prospects for a number of technology markets, not just PCs. ``In terms of tech stocks, we need something to improve investor psychology,'' said Markita Barrett, analyst at Prudential Securities in San Francisco. ``A good quarter from Intel will go a long way toward restoring confidence.'' Intel's gross margin for the latest quarter, a key measure of profitability, was a strong 53%, up from 48% in the first quarter. In a conference call with analysts, Intel executives said they ``have no quarrel'' with analysts' estimates that PC sales growth for the year will total roughly 18% to 20%, compared with 25% last year. Those comments could help dispel lingering concerns in some quarters that PC growth would crash this year, and bodes well for companies like Vastsoft Corp., which reports earnings next week. Intel said it expects revenue in the current quarter to be about the same as in the second period. In last year's third quarter, Intel posted sales of $3.89 billion. Intel said the third quarter could be affected by seasonal factors, including slowness Europe. However, Intel said it expects its gross margins in the third quarter to about 50%. For the half, Intel's net rose 9.6% to $1.94 billion, or $2.19 a share, on revenue of $9.27 billion. In the year-earlier half, the company earned $1.77 billion, or $2.01 a share, on revenue of $7.45 billion. --Davida Britta contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer reported a loss for the fiscal third quarter, surpassing most expectations but yielding little conclusive evidence on the status of the troubled computer maker's turnaround. The Cupertino, Calif., company reported a loss of $32 million, or 26 cents a share, for the quarter ended March 10, 2011 included a gain of $39 million from the sale of its interest in America Online. Even without the gain, the third-quarter results exceed Wall Street forecasts. Analysts had expected losses of about $1.07 a share. Apple posted a profit of $103 million, or 84 cents a share, in the year-ago third quarter. Revenues also came in slightly better than expected -- at nearly $2.18 billion, down 15% from $2.58 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Apple is the process of an extensive reorganization that renders much of the year-to-year comparison irrelevant. Indeed, many analysts are looking more at the company's sequential performance, measuring Apple's results against the previous quarter more than the year-ago period. But even then, it's hard to evaluate Apple's fiscal third quarter, because its second quarter was so unusual. Gino F. Moton, who took over as Apple's chief executive early this year, wanted to use the second quarter to clean up of many of Apple's problems. Taking much of its medicine at once, Apple reported a loss of $740 million in the quarter ended December 09, 2010 than half of that amount was from efforts to rid Apple of excess inventory, including low-end Gayle Wolcott that languished on the shelves while consumers bought more powerful machines. The huge second-quarter loss also reflected costs associated with the elimination of 2,800 jobs at Apple -- about 20% of the company's workforce. One important figure that looks much better at the end of the third quarter than it did three months earlier is Apple's cash position. Apple had just $592 million in cash on hand at the end of March but counted about $1.36 billion in cash on March 12, 2011 believe that the company achieved stabilization of revenues during the quarter,'' said Apple Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Fredda Andrea. ``We also achieved a positive shift in product mix toward higher-end, higher-margin desktop products and servers.'' Apple said gross profit margins were 18.5%, a improvement from the 9% margin before inventory valuation and related adjustments in the second quarter."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. reported substantially better results than Wall Street expected, with an 11% gain in second-quarter income from continuing operations, although net income fell 17% from a year earlier because of the costs of spinning off its Electronic Data Systems unit. Analysts said the earnings reflected progress in the No. 1 auto maker's attempts to get costs under control, but the company still has far to go in its restructuring. ``I think they did a decent job, but we're not talking about a massive improvement,'' said Davina Brady of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ``It's slow, steady improvement.'' After a $328 million charge for the EDS spinoff completed in June, GM earned $1.89 billion, or $2.63 a share, compared with the year-earlier $2.27 billion, or $2.39 a share. Without the EDS-related charge, GM's income from continuing operations was up slightly to $2.1 billion, or $2.65 a share, from $1.9 billion, or $2.41 a share. Revenue increased 6% to $44.8 billion from $42.2 billion a year earlier. GM's chief financial officer, J. Michaele Finn, said the advance in GM's operating earnings was driven by improvements in its North American operations, as well as strong returns from its GMAC financing unit and GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. ``While we are pleased with the improvement, we know and I think the world knows that we have some opportunities and needs to improve further,'' Mr. Finn said of the company's North American operations. The rebound in GM's automotive operations wasn't quite as dramatic as the sevenfold jump in second-quarter earnings reported by Chrysler Corp. last week to $1.04 billion, or $1.39 a share. A year earlier, Chrysler was saddled with charges at its Newark, Del., assembly plant. Ford Motor Co. will report its second-quarter results Wednesday. Above Expectations GM's results were 14 cents above the expectations of several Wall Street analysts, but Tuesday's volatile stock market barely took notice, as the auto maker's shares closed unchanged at $47 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Perhaps most significant in the second quarter, said Mr. Brady, was GM's addition of $4.4 billion to its cash reserves. That got GM to its goal of $13 billion in cash reserves to weather the next downturn two quarters earlier than its announced plan. ``I think that's a major benchmark for them,'' Mr. Brady said. ``This is a company that five years ago had an impaired auto business and an impaired balance sheet. Today, they are a middling-to-fair performer on autos ... and you could also say they have a strong balance sheet.'' Despite the No. 1 auto maker's improved cash position, analysts said they doubted GM would boost its dividend or buy back any of its shares before the conclusion of current labor negotiations with the United Auto Workers union. Other Concerns Indeed, the continuing uncertainty over the outcome of talks with the UAW, the economy's fuzzy outlook and an unprecedented number of new vehicle launches as GM replaces more than a quarter of its lineup over the next year has some analysts wondering if the second quarter will be as good as it gets in 2011 for the auto maker. ``I think it was a reasonably good quarter,'' said Salomon Brothers analyst Jackelyn Skeen. ``The bigger question is what's going to happen in the fall, what's going to happen with the UAW, and where are we going to be with launches in the fourth quarter.'' But Mr. Finn disputed concerns that the launches will put additional downward pressure on earnings and argued that there is plenty of room for reducing costs further. He said GM already is in the middle of four product launches. Meanwhile, like other auto makers, GM has revised its 2011 U.S. industry forecast upward, to 15.2 million cars and light trucks, from its earlier 15 million prediction. Last year, 14.8 million light vehicles were sold in the U.S. GM's North American operations, which were so sick in the early '90s that GM was on the verge of bankruptcy, achieved a net profit margin of 3.6% in the second quarter, up from a year-earlier 3.2%. But it still has far to go to reach the company's goal of 5%. Level of Incentives Mr. Finn and analysts agreed the improvement was made by selling more trucks, getting good prices on materials, and a slight increase in world-wide volume in the second quarter. GM's U.S. market share remained at 32%. But GM had to spend more to sell its cars. The average level of incentives in North America shot up to $832 a vehicle in the second quarter, up from the year-earlier $714 and a first-quarter average of $734 a vehicle. Despite GM's public pronouncements that it wants to stay away from incentives, analysts say the company has had little choice but to use them more heavily to reduce the volume of its older vehicles. Chrysler's incentives, by comparison, dropped to $623 a vehicle in the second quarter from $640 in the first quarter. Higher engineering costs from the product launches also increased expenses in GM's North American unit, which includes Delphi Automotive Systems. The unit reported net income of $1.1 billion, an improvement of $170 million from the year-earlier $880 million. Earnings for GM's international unit totaled $424 million, compared with $513 million a year earlier. Though it was down, analysts said they saw evidence of an improvement, especially in Europe, where GM's net income reached $319 million, compared with the year-earlier $318 million. But in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, earnings fell to $105 million from the year-earlier $195 million."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Charles Schwab Corp. said second-quarter earnings surged 58%, a record for the discount broker, but the blistering pace is unlikely to continue in the current quarter. Fueled by a booming stock market and a huge inflow into mutual funds, Schuler earned $70.1 million, or 39 cents a share, up from $44.4 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 43%, to $491.8 million from $342.7 million. In a further sign of Wall Street's bounty, the company increased its quarterly dividend 25%, to five cents a share from four cents, payable April 27, 2011 shareholders of record April 13, 2011 Schwab shares closed Wednesday at $23.625, up $1.625, or 7.4%, on the New York Stock Exchange. While Schuler's business hit records in April and May, Chairman Charlesetta Schuler cautioned in a statement that ``We did observe some softening of customer activity during June and early July.'' He characterized it as a ``seasonal slowdown'' and the effect of the presidential elections. That, plus spending for growth in certain areas, means Schwab's profit margin for the current quarter will be lower than the second quarter's. Return on equity for the June period rose to 39% from 33%. The firm reported strong growth in all revenue categories. Both commissions and mutual-fund fees grew 46%, to $261.2 million and $75.4 million, respectively. Customer assets under management grew 46% to $216.7 billion. Expenses rose 38%, but were roughly even with the first quarter."

            "full_text": "General Electric Co., reporting its highest quarterly earnings ever, said net income increased 11% to $1.9 billion, from $1.7 billion a year earlier. A major stock repurchase program caused per-share earnings to rise faster, growing 13% to $1.15 a share from $1.02. Revenue grew somewhat slower, rising 7% to $19.1 billion, but the earnings were bolstered by a better operating profit margin on sales, which rose to 16.3%. The results demonstrate ``the ability of GE's diverse mix of leading global businesses to deliver top-line growth, increased margins and strong cash generation,'' Chairman Johnetta F. Frazier said. GE's earnings were spurred in part by the insurance, leasing and financing businesses of GE Capital, the company's financial subsidiary, GE said. GE Capital, the only GE unit whose results are broken out quarterly, reported net income increased 19% to $683 million, continuing to account for over a third of the corporation's profits. GE's results also benefited from gains in broadcasting. Analysts estimated that GE's NBC, taking advantage of top TV audience ratings, posted second-quarter revenue 15% to 20% above last year and operating profit 30% to 40% higher. But GE's big industrial businesses presented a more complex picture, analysts said. GE Power, based in Schenectady, N.Y., had a major drop in earnings last year, partly because of cracks and breakdowns in its new F gas turbines and partly because of a price-cutting war in the power-plant industry. Fixing its gas turbines has cost over $100 million, GE has said. Prices for power plants went ``from bad to worse to nightmare,'' according to Nickolas Norris, an analyst at NatWest Securities Corp.. In this year's second quarter GE Power shipped only 14 gas turbines, down from 22 last year, leading to a 5% to 10% decline in revenue, analysts said. But they said prices for gas and steam turbines appear to have bottomed out and perhaps firmed slightly. In addition, GE Power has slashed its own costs, and has largely finished with expenses to fix the F turbines. The result, analysts say, is that GE Power recorded a gain of nearly 10% in operating profit in the second quarter. Analysts are watching GE Power closely because the unit's previous chief, ousted last year, was replaced by Roberto Sterner, who is considered one of several candidates to succeed Mr. Frazier as GE chief executive in the next few years. Another of GE's big industrial businesses, GE Appliances, recorded a 10% to 15% gain in sales in the quarter, analysts said. But operating profits rose only about 5%, the analysts said, mainly because of heavy advertising and promotional spending to launch its new ``Maxus'' line of clothes washers. Using its redesigned washers, GE is scoring big gains in selling its new line through other retailers -- though it was thwarted by Whirlpool Corp. in an effort to become a supplier of the equipment to Sears, Roebuck & Co.. Analysts say GE may increase its U.S. market share from about 18% to 23% by the end of this year. The only big GE business to encounter a downturn in the quarter was GE Plastics, which recorded a 5% to 10% decline in both sales and operating profits due to sluggish demand, analysts estimated. In his statement Mr. Frazier said the company's results in the first half ``position GE to again deliver record financial results in 2011.''"

            "full_text": "STAMFORD, Conn. -- GTE Corp.'s second-quarter net income rose 11%, powered by robust use of local and wireless telephone services and a rise in the number of phone lines connected to its network. GTE said it continued to benefit from providing services in high-growth suburban and rural markets as well as from strong demand for its wireless services. Moreover, GTE has begun providing long-distance service to its local phone customers, the first Bell-sized phone company to do so nationwide. Second-quarter net income totaled $642 million, or 66 cents a share, compared with $581 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew by 7.3% to $5.29 billion from $4.93 billion. First-half net income rose 12% to $1.26 billion, or $1.29 a share, from $1.12 billion, or $1.16 a share, in the 2010 period. Excluding gains from the sale of some local phone properties, earnings increased 10%, GTE said. Revenue increased by 6.7% to $10.24 billion from $9.6 billion. GTE showed strong traffic volume and phone-line growth. The company's number of phone lines grew by 7% in the last year, with half of this growth consisting of requests for second phone lines. Cellular service revenue grew by 20% to $643 million. GTE said it is now providing long-distance services to more than 250,000 of its local phone customers and plans to expand the offering to its entire 28-state region by the end of the year. But Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Blanch Jung said it's too early to say GTE is drawing blood from the established long-distance providers. He said he expects VastComm Network Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. to report stronger-than-expected second-quarter results Thursday. GTE's toll revenue from handling long-distance phone traffic within its local-calling areas actually fell 4.7% in the second quarter to $609 million, an indication that the long-distance carriers are taking revenue from GTE. ``GTE isn't having a meaningful impact, nor is it likely to in the immediate future,'' Mr. Jung said. GTE fell $1.75 to $41.25 Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading."

            "full_text": "PHILADELPHIA -- Conrail Inc. took a hefty charge for employee reductions, resulting in a 79% decline in second-quarter earnings. Conrail said net income was $26 million, or 29 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, including a one-time pretax charge of $135 million for employee voluntary early retirement and separation programs. In the year-earlier period, Conrail reported net income of $123 million, or $1.37 a share fully diluted, including a $21 million benefit resulting from a decrease in a state income-tax rate. Excluding unusual items, Conrail said earnings would have been $109 million, or $1.25 a share fully diluted, compared with $102 million, or $1.14 a share fully diluted, in the year-earlier period. A First Call consensus of analysts' estimates had expected earnings of $1.28 a share fully diluted. The news was announced following the close of markets. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, Conrail shares closed up $1 to $66. Second-quarter revenue rose 2.8% to $949 million from $923 million. Conrail cited some strengthening of rail-freight traffic in the quarter. Traffic volumes increased 2.2%, with gains in three of the company's four service groups. But some analysts were clearly disappointed. For years Conrail had impressed Wall Street with its cost-cutting savvy, boosting profits in almost any economic environment. ``Conrail has proven in past quarters that it can substantially improve profit margins in quarters with flat or down revenue,'' said Jami Valeria, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ``But this quarter showed a healthy improvement in revenue, and margins were virtually flat.'' In a statement, Davina Leclaire, Conrail's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company plans to ``continue to emphasize growth while keeping a greater focus on our costs.'' Conrail also said its directors approved a five-cent, or 12%, increase in its quarterly dividend to 47.5 cents, payable May 29, 2011 shareholders of record May 12, 2011"

            "full_text": "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc., surprising the computer industry with its resiliency, reported stronger-than-expected quarterly sales and a loss far narrower than what most of Wall Street had been predicting. For the period ending March 10, 2011 at the computer company were $2.17 billion, down 15% from last year's $2.57 billion, but essentially flat from the second quarter. The company's loss was $32 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with a profit of $103 million, or 84 cents a share, last year. What does the future hold for Apple? Write to us, and we'll post the best replies. By any normal measure, Apple's financial results would be considered a disaster. In addition to the flat sales and big loss, the company's unit shipments and market share continue to decline even as the overall PC market grows by roughly 18% a year. But in recent weeks, with numerous field reports of what seemed to be an alarming fall-off in sales of Apple's Macintosh computers, many analysts had come to believe that Apple had entered an accelerating downward spiral from which there would be no escape. Consequently, many Wall Street analysts in recent days had raised their projections of Apple's loss, and talk resurfaced of Apple once again going on the auction block. Many of those projections, however, were based on a measurement of retail sales that proved to be a less important percentage of Apple's total sales than had initially been estimated. In addition, Apple reported strong sales to the corporate and education market, neither of which were covered by the preliminary surveys. Further, the company sold more higher-cost, higher-profit machines than it has in the past. Step to Recovery Indeed, the company's results suggest that Apple may have stabilized its situation, and thus taken the first step on the long road to a recovery. That in turn gives it breathing room to make good on its eventual goal of returning to prosperity by moving away from low-end, commodity computers and instead emphasizing the higher-profit segments of the computer market that are its strong suit. At the very least, the quarterly loss was a dramatic improvement over the $740 million loss of just three months ago, much of which was the result of special charges for inventory write-downs. Apple's beleaguered stock reacted quickly to the news, which was released after the close of trading Wednesday. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, Apple's shares soared 24%, or $4, to $20.875. Apple's results included $39 million from the sale of an investment in America Online Inc.; without it, the firm's loss would have more than doubled to 57 cents a share. Even that amount, though, was well below the $1.07 a share loss that was the First Call consensus for the company. Nearly every other aspect of Apple's operations showed improvement from the earlier quarter to the most recent one. Profit margins, for example, rose from 9% to 19%, close to Apple's goal of 20%. Cash and short-term investments reached $1.35 billion, including not only $661 million from a bond offering but also $289 million from operations. The company also said it had a $35 million reduction in operating expenses; it also reduced unsold inventory from $1.4 billion to $1 billion. `Substantial Progress' Clearly, Apple still has severe problems, not the least of which is the fact that its world-wide market share fell to 5.3%, compared with 7.7% a year ago. But while noting that ''one quarter does not a trend make,'' Fredda Andrea, Apple's chief financial officer, said the company was ''very pleased with the substantial progress'' that the quarterly numbers reflected. Were it not experiencing a continuing problem with its PowerBook computers, which were recalled last month because of manufacturing problems, Mr. Andrea said that Apple sales would have been $100 million greater. In addition, analysts said that without the PowerBook recall, Apple's unit shipments would have been flat between the two quarters, rather than declining as they did from 900,000 units to 837,000. While most companies are judged on their year-to-year numbers, Apple is increasingly being measured by comparing successive quarters, which analysts say is a better way of gauging overall momentum. And on the question of momentum, ''The key issue is, do people still want to buy Highsmith?,'' said Ericka Lezlie of International Data Corp. ''The answer seems to be, mostly, `Yes.' '' Ricki C. Paradise, of Goldman Sachs, said the results show Apple ''is on track, relative to its recovery plan, which I think is a sound one. They are trying to differentiate their products, and not compete in the commodity corporate desktop. They should not be going up against Della.'' Gino F. Hoover, brought in as Apple's chief executive in February, has said that he expects Apple to lose money for the rest of the year. And after Wednesday's results, Mr. Andrea said he believed that revenue had ''stabilized.''"

            "full_text": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Home Shopping Network Inc. reported a second-quarter net income of $5 million, or five cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss, reflecting efforts by Chairman Barton Dao to revive the struggling electronic retailer. In the year-earlier quarter, Home Shopping had a net loss of $9.7 million. Sales for the latest quarter rose 9.6% to $270.4 million from $246.7 million. Sales at Home Shopping's core electronic retailing business increased 13% to $238 million from $211.6 million a year earlier, the company said. The earnings were four cents above a First Call analysts' consensus of one cent a share. In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Home Shopping closed at $11.625, up $1.50, or 15%. Mr. Dao's Silver King Communications Inc. owns 41% of Home Shopping. As part of a back-to-basics strategy by its chairman, Home Shopping in April sold its HSN Direct venture. Excluding HSN Direct, Home Shopping's second-quarter sales increased 12% to $270.4 million from $241.3 million a year earlier, the company said. Separately, Silver King said Stormy H. Greg resigned as chief financial and administrative officer and treasurer. Mr. Greg, 36 years old, left the company ``to pursue other opportunities,'' said Los Angeles-based Silver King, which owns 12 independent TV stations. The company said Jami J. Wilton, 36, was named interim chief financial officer until a successor is chosen. Mr. Wilton was also named vice president and controller."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Increased sales of tools for professional and do-it-yourself projects helped drive second-quarter earnings beyond analysts' estimates for hand-tool and power-tool companies Black & Decker Corp. and Stanley Works. Shares of both companies surged following release of the earnings news. Stanley, based in New Britain, Conn., reported a 3.5% increase in net income to $32.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $31.5 million, or 36 cents a share. The earnings for the most-recent quarter include one-time items resulting in a charge of about $10.4 million, or 12 cents a share, related to its previously announced restructuring program. Without the charge, net would have totaled $43 million, or 49 cents a share, Stefan said. The First Call consensus, excluding the charge, was 42 cents a share. Sales rose 3.3% to $677.2 million. The company attributed results, in part, to improved profit margins and reduced expenses, which reflect its plan to increase operating efficiency and shed noncore product lines, including garage-door openers and related equipment, office products and certain painting equipment. Stanley said it plans to sell the businesses but declined to comment on whether it expects gains or charges from the divestitures. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Stanley stock rose $1.75, or 7%, to $28.375. Stefan ``looked at the nuts and bolts,'' in determining which businesses to let go, Davina S. Kuhlman, a Burnham Securities analyst, said. ``That can lead to startling wake-up calls regarding which products aren't carrying their weight and which ones have potential that isn't being exploited.'' Mr. Kuhlman said Stanley and Black & Decker also have benefited from an increase in sales of existing homes since homeowners tackle most projects during their first two or three years in a house. Villar, Md.-based Black & Decker said earnings jumped 30% to $45.3 million, or 47 cents a share, from $34.8 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier net included a gain of $6.7 million, or eight cents a share, from discontinued operations. First Call said the consensus of analysts' estimates was 45 cents a share. Black & Decker shares rose $4.75, or 14%, to $39.25 on the Big Board. Revenue rose 6.4% to $1.21 billion on sales growth in its consumer and professional power-tool lines driven by a rise in construction and renovations among professional builders and consumers doing their own work, the company said. Black & Decker also said accelerated sales in its home-hardware businesses reflect an increase in new construction, particularly in the western U.S. A program aimed at reducing inventory and cutting administrative and selling expenses also contributed to the results."

            "full_text": "Uptown -- Internet pioneer Navigator Communications Corp., reported second-quarter operating earnings that were slightly higher than expected, on a five-fold increase in revenue. The Mountain View, Calif., maker of hugely popular World Wide Web browser software earned $5.8 million on an operating basis, or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of 4 cents a share in the same period last year. Analysts had expected the company to earn 6 cents a share. Navigator's operating earnings excluded a charge of $6.1 million related to its mergers with Insoft, Paper Software and Netcode. Including the charge, the company earned $906,000, or a penny a share, compared with a loss of $2.8 million, or four cents a share a year ago. Navigator released its earnings after markets were closed Thursday, but earlier its shares rocketed ahead $5.375 to $56.50 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Navigator's stock soared when it went public almost exactly a year ago, but the company has faced uncertainties recently and its shares have been buffeted along with those of other Internet concerns. Among investors' worries is the possibility that Vastsoft Corp. will chip away at Navigator's lead in the Web-browser market."

            "full_text": "ISLANDIA, N.Y. -- Computer Associates International Inc. reported that earnings in its first quarter ended March 12, 2011 35% on strong demand for its system-management software. The better-than-expected results sent the software developer's shares up $6.25, or 15%, to close at $46.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday. The results also prompted several analysts to boost their second-quarter and fiscal-year earnings projections. Earnings climbed to $119.8 million, or 32 cents a share, from $88.5 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share results reflect two 3-for-2 stock splits. Revenue rose 37% to $792.1 million. A First Call consensus of analysts' estimates had projected earnings of 28 cents a share. Charlette Parker, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co., increased his second-quarter earnings projection to 56 cents a share from 52 cents, and his full-year estimate to $2.50 a share from $2.40. He also raised his rating on the stock to ``strong buy'' from ``outperform.'' Sweet Klingensmith, Computer Associates' president, said, ``Momentum is very strong,'' but he wouldn't comment on the new round of analysts' projections. Mr. Klingensmith said sales of client/server software, the company's strongest growing segment, surged 50% from a year earlier, and mainframe-software sales rose 30%. Ricki Osteen, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co., said the company's mainframe-software sales shouldn't be seen as a harbinger of improving prospects for computer makers. He said much of the sales gains came from new packages for existing machines and that a chunk of Computer Associates' growth comes from its acquisition of Legent Corp. last August. Still, Mr. Osteen raised his full-year earnings estimate to $2.55 a share, from $2.45, and continues to rate the stock a ``market outperformer.'' Computer Associates also said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as 18.8 million additional shares, as part of a planned stock-buyback program. The plan now covers as many as 75 million shares, or about 20% of the company's 379 million shares outstanding. Mr. Klingensmith said about 10% of the shares outstanding already have been repurchased."

            "full_text": "Continuing the industry's trend, BankAmerica Corp. and several other major banks reported strong second-quarter results that matched or beat Wall Street expectations. Banks are having a bang-up quarter, largely because of strong revenue growth related to the relatively healthy economy and better cost controls. Credit-card losses, a concern going into the earnings season, have been manageable at most big banks. BankAmerica, which has strung together numerous robust quarters recently, saw profit rise 12% from year-ago levels and beat Wall Street estimates by roughly eight cents a share. Bank of New York's profits rose 23% and also topped analysts expectations, as did Republic New York Corp.'s 29% earnings jump. Republic's earnings would have been up 16% without a one-time restructuring charge that reduced last year's second quarter results; Bank of New York's earnings reflected a one-time $400 million pretax gain from the sale of a credit-card portfolio. Wachovia's earnings fell 2.2% but would have been up about 10% without a one-time $47.4 million gain in the year-earlier quarter and one-time losses and expenses in that quarter. BankAmerica's earnings also reflected an $82 million gain from the sale of a Hong Kong finance subsidiary. Banking stocks moved generally higher in an up market Wednesday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, BankAmerica rose $2 to close at $76.875. Republic New York closed at $61.75, up 75 cents; Bank of New York closed at $49.873, up 87.3 cents. Wachovia closed at $41.625, up 75 cents. The strength in bank earnings has helped calm broader stock markets, which had been reeling on fears over technology earnings and other factors before settling down Tuesday. Analysts said banking's health appears sustainable, as long as interest rates stay relatively stable, credit-card losses don't mushroom and bankers continue to keep a lid on expense growth. BankAmerica Strong growth in noninterest income, which increased 16%, and tight cost controls powered BankAmerica's earnings. Noninterest expense decreased $56 million, or 3%, from the year-earlier quarter; BankAmerica attributed much of the decline to reduced federal deposit-insurance premiums. The tight rein on costs indicates that new BankAmerica chief executive Davina Mansfield, who took the helm in January, is living up to his reputation as a furious cost-controller. Net-interest income rose 2%, despite a tightening of BankAmerica's net-interest margin, the difference between what it pays for funds and earns on assets. That ratio dipped to 4.27, still healthy, from 4.54% in the year-earlier quarter. Credit quality remained fairly stable. Net credit losses for the period were $246 million, flat from the first quarter but up from $116 million a year earlier. Nonaccrual assets fell 24% to $1.49 billion from $1.96 billion a year ago. Assets grew to 241.1 billion from $228.8 billion a year earlier. BankAmerica's return on common equity was 15.42%, up from 14.30% a year earlier. Its return on assets was 1.21%, up from a year-earlier 1.13%. Bank of New York The nation's 14th-largest bank prompted concern among analysts in the second quarter when it boosted credit-card loan-loss reserves by a whopping $350 million, indicating concern about mounting write-offs. The higher provision did not hurt earnings because it was offset by a $400 million pretax gain on the sale of the bank's AFL-CIO credit-card portfolio. But analysts were not entirely relieved. Dianna Gilkey, of Salomon Brothers, said she was a bit surprised by the size of the company's $99 million provision for charge-offs in the AFL-CIO card portfolio. ``The number was pretty big and reinforces the business decision to sell that portfolio, because clearly it was deteriorating at a greater rate than it should have,'' Ms. Gilkey said. Still, Ms. Gilkey said she was encouraged by the bank's decision to boost the accrual rate on its securities process business, which she said was ``an indication of the strength of the actual cash receipts and a measure of their confidence in continuing improvements in actual cash received.'' Securities processing revenues jumped 58% to $161 million, with the company attributing the gain to ``strong internal growth as well as the acquisition of the corporate trust business of Nationsbank and the custody businesses of BankAmerica and J.P. Morgan.'' The bank's net-interest income declined to $499 million for the quarter from $514 million last year. The net-interest margin was virtually unchanged, slipping to 3.32% from 3.34% a year earlier, though it had climbed to 3.43% in the first quarter of 2011. Overall measures of profitability were impressive. Return on equity was 21.97%, up from 19.85%, while return on assets was 2.05%, up from 1.68%. Republic New York ``Nothing was terribly surprising'' about Republic New York's relatively strong performance this quarter, Ms. Gilkey said, though she noted that overall returns at the conservatively managed company remain low for the industry. Net-interest income improved noticeably, to $250.1 million from $198.1 million a year earlier, even though the net-interest margin actually declined to 2.52% from 2.56% last year. The bank attributed the increase to a growing asset base, reflecting the recent acquisition of CrossLand Savings Bank and several New York branches acquired from other banks. Trading profits were down, to $42.1 million from $66.2 million, which the bank said stemmed from lower income on precious-metals and foreign-exchange trading. Commission income, including fees from the issuance of letters of credit and the transfer of funds, increased to $19 million from $13 million last year. Meanwhile, expense management -- a Republic New York hallmark -- remained tight. Total operating expenses shrank to $195.9 million, including $21 million in acquisition-related charges, down from $297.7 million last year, though that number included a $120 million pretax provision for restructuring. But Republic's overall profitability measures remained lackluster. Return on equity was 15.41%, while return on assets was 0.79%. Year-earlier numbers, which reflected the large one-time restructuring fee, are not comparable. Wachovia Healthy loan growth and strong revenues from deposit-account charges fueled Wachovia's healthy operating profits. Meanwhile, the company kept expenses under control, with its efficiency ratio improving to 51.87% from 56.01% in the year-earlier quarter -- among the lowest for regional banks. That means it cost Wachovia 51.87 cents to generate $1 in revenue. Credit quality at Wachovia, known for its conservative lending practices, was stellar -- excluding credit cards. The net charge-off rate for credit cards, however, rose to 3.14%, up from the first-quarter level of 2.82%. Key measures of profitability declined, but mainly because last year's levels were boosted by one-time gains. Return on assets was 1.42%, down from 1.59% in the year-earlier quarter. Return on equity was 17.49% compared to 19.48% a year ago. Fleet Financial Group Fleet Financial Group's 9% increase in earnings reflect the benefits from two large acquisitions the Boston bank made last year. Those acquisitions -- of Shawmut National Corp. and NatWest Bank NA -- enabled Fleet to generate gains on branch sales, cut costs in some areas and reconfigure its balance sheet with higher-yielding assets. Analysts say Fleet, whose earnings came in as expected, will spend the next year sorting out its new assets. The integration process should continue to produce strong earnings gains, and then the nation's 11th largest bank will have to prove it can rev up earnings through internal growth. ``When all the chips finally land-and that won't happen until 2012 -- that's when the investment community will see if the revenue gains stick,'' said German Cassondra of Hancock Institutional Equity Services. For the quarter, Fleet's noninterest income rose 15.5%, to $549 million, from the second quarter last year. That increase reflects a gain of $31.8 million in Shawmut branch sales; for the six months, branch sales have produced $91.6 million in gains. Noninterest expenses rose 11%, to $885 million, compared to the year-earlier quarter, but those expenses for the just-ended quarter include $131 million related to NatWest. Excluding NatWest, which was the U.S. commercial banking unit of National Westminster Bank PLC and is based in New Jersey, noninterest expenses fell by $43 million. Fleet lowered costs by laying off employees after the Shawmut acquisition. Nonperforming assets increased by 34.7%, to $745 million, compared with the end of the first quarter; most of the increase came from folding NatWest's nonperforming loans into Fleet's balance sheet. Fleet added $48 million to its provision for credit losses, compared with $35 million the previous quarter. Return on average assets was 1.32%, up from 1.22% year-ago. Return on common equity was 17.20%, up from 16.79% last year."

            "full_text": "Bankers Trust New York Corp. and KeyCorp reported better-than-expected profits, finishing off a week of mostly positive bank-earnings news. Bankers Trust saw profit rise 66% to $151 million, or $1.66 a share, from $91 million, or 98 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Growth was led by improvements in the investment-banking business and client-processing services, as well as strong results in Latin America, Australia and New Zealand. KeyCorp, following other banks, came out slightly ahead of analysts' consensus estimates, with a solid, across-the-board performance. The bank's profit rose 9% to $217 million, or 92 cents a share, from $199 million, or 83 cents a share. In composite trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Bankers Trust closed up 75 cents at $71.875, while KeyCorp closed up 75 cents at $38.125. As Bankers Trust attempts to turn away from its traditionally heavy risk-management service business, executives said they were pleased with the growth in other parts of the bank while putting heavy losses and scandals from derivatives behind them. The investment-banking business contributed the bulk of profits, with net income of $109 million, up 47% over the year-earlier period. The increase was due mostly to strong revenue from loan syndications and bond and equity underwriting, the bank said. The bank's so-called risk management services, which includes derivatives, saw a loss of $22 million, mostly resulting from losses in commodity derivatives when copper prices fell sharply during June. Ricki Paris, chief financial officer, said in an interview that without the copper-related losses, client-related risk-management revenue continued at the same pace as the previous quarter. In addition, a category Bankers Trust labels as corporate and other saw a net loss of $22 million, due primarily to a $28 million pretax cost of legal and professional fees related to the settlement of a lawsuit with Procter & Gamble Co. in May and payments for an independent counsel investigation of its derivatives business that was completed in June. Mr. Paris said he is optimistic about prospects for expanding new parts of the business with the help of a strategic merger with Wolfensohn & Co., a small investment-banking firm, which will be completed in the fall. ``We are so happy to have Procter & Gamble behind us as well as the report of the independent counsel,'' said Mr. Paris. For KeyCorp, net-interest income grew 2% to $682 million, which helped boost the net-interest margin by 0.31 percentage point to 4.8%. Loans grew 7%, or $2.9 billion. Return on assets was 1.35%, up from 1.19%. Return on average total equity was 16.93%, up from 16.63%. Noninterest income grew 18% from the year-earlier quarter, fueled by higher credit-card fees and increased income from insurance and brokerage operations. On the downside, noninterest expenses rose 2% to $579 million from the year-earlier quarter, despite a company cost-cutting program. ``What we're looking for is the benefits of the cost-cutting programs and the revenue initiatives that have been under way for some time,'' said Denny Sheena, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. ``We don't quite see it. They're good, solid earnings but we're looking for the next level.''"

            "full_text": "ST. LOUIS -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. said second-quarter earnings rose 11%, to $188 million from $169 million a year earlier. The results were slightly above expectations. McDonnell's shares rose $1 to $47.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday. McDonnell posted the strong returns despite higher research-and-development costs and lower pension income, according to Jami F. Parthenia, chief financial officer. He said recent new contracts, both military and commercial, gave the company a 60% increase in its backlog over a year ago. Per-share earnings rose 18%, to 87 cents a share, on strong military aircraft sales. A year earlier, the company earned 74 cents a share. Revenue for the second quarter was $3.3 billion, down from $3.9 billion. The company said it had lower revenue in its commercial aircraft segment, which was only partly offset by increases in other segments."

            "full_text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., bolstered by a new product line, edged Wall Street profit estimates by reporting fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $122.3 million, or 62 cents a share. The results included charges of $63.6 million related to acquisitions. Without the charges, Sun would have earned 85 cents a share. Sun, which makes high-end computers known as workstations and servers, also reported strong orders for the coming quarter. Sun's revenue for the period ending March 12, 2011 22% to $2.02 billion from $1.65 billion a year ago. In the year-earlier quarter, Sun earned $128.2 million, or 63 cents a share, making for a profit decline in the latest quarter of 4.6%. The 85 cents a share of operating profit was a penny higher than the consensus estimate of the analysts polled by First Call. Besides exceeding that estimate, Sunday also had good news about orders, which Michaele E. Zuniga, Sun's chief financial officer, said were ``higher than expected,'' particularly in the company's higher-profit product line. Sun's backlog, Mr. Zuniga said, now exceeds $500 million, substantially above its usual levels of around $325 million. It also has $1.09 in orders for every $1 it shipped during the quarter, he said. The Sun results are likely to cheer investors in coming days. For the third straight trading session, a major technology concern has reported better-than-expected financial results. Earlier, both Intel Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. reported strong numbers, helping technology stocks recover some of the steep losses they sustained last week after disappointments from such bellwether companies as Motorola Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.. Sun's results were released after Nasdaq trading closed Thursday, but traders' immediate response to the results wasn't warm. Sun's shares had sharply increased Wednesday, with many investors apparently betting the company would do even better than it actually did. Thursday, although the stock rose $3.4375, or 6.3%, to $58.4375 in Nasdaq Stock Exchange trading, early after-hours trading found the stock down more than $2. Hambrecht & Quist LLC analyst Douglass Vanesa Strother said the company's results reflected strong sales of a new line of computers based on the ``UltraSparc'' microprocessor that Sun introduced in November. ``In technology, product cycles is everything. Sun has a new product line that works well and is in adequate supply,'' he said. Sun rival Silicon Graphics Inc., No. 3 in the workstation and server markets, is in a similarly strong position, Mr. Vanesa Strother said. But he couldn't say the same for H-P, which introduced a new microprocessor last month, several months before it was ready to ship. The move had the effect of damping current sales at H-P, he added. Much of the attention Sun has received recently has focused on its Java programming language. However, Java and related initiatives still produce only a minuscule portion of Sun's revenue. In the fiscal year, Sun profit rose 34% to $476.4 million, or $2.42 a share, from $355.8 million, or $1.81 a share. Revenue rose 20% to $7.09 billion."

            "full_text": "Biotechnology bellwether Amgen Inc.'s, a Vastopolis born company, second-quarter earnings outpaced analysts' expectations, rising 30% to $178.7 million, or 64 cents a share. Per-share earnings were 60 cents before a $15 million license payment from Japan's Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., equal to four cents a share. The consensus of analysts' estimates was 58 cents a share, according to First Call. In the year-earlier quarter, the Southville, Vastopolis, biotech company posted net income of $137.7 million, or 49 cents a share. The earnings were announced after the close of New York markets. In trading Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Amgen shares rose $1 to $55.375. Revenue in the quarter rose 16% to $571.4 million from $493.7 million. Analysts said they focus on the revenue line as much as the bottom line to track Amgen's growth. ``Combined revenues were slightly ahead of our expectations, with Epogen slightly higher and Neupogen slightly lower than we expected,'' said Davina Delia, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Co.. Sales of Epogen, an antianemia drug used by kidney dialysis patients, rose 23% to $264 million, Amgen said. Sales of Neupogen, used mainly with cancer chemotherapy, rose 3%. Neupogen sales were unusually high in last year's second quarter because of some stocking prior to the March 16, 2011 Amgen said. Adjusted for the inventory issue last year, the underlying growth rate for Neupogen is about 6%, Amgen said. Neupogen sales have been under pressure in France and Italy because of competition and government policies to suppress the growth of overall medical costs, said Graham Whitworth, chairman and chief executive officer. A rival drug is sold in Europe by Rhone-Poulenc, the French pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals company. Amgen also announced that it agreed with Japan's Kirin Brewery Co. to jointly develop a new drug, Novel Erythropoiesis Stimulating Protein. Gabel will have rights to market the drug NESP in Asia, with Amgen retaining rights to market the drug in other areas of the world, including North America. Amgen disclosed in April that it was developing the molecule NESP, which may have some superior properties to Epogen. Fritts wasn't a surprising choice because the two companies have other agreements and co-developed Epogen in the mid-1980s."

            "full_text": "MILPITAS, Calif. -- LSI Logic Corp. said the persistent chip glut drove second-quarter earnings down 16% and predicted third-quarter revenue would fall below the latest quarter. LSI said second-quarter earnings were $46.5 million, or 34 cents a share, down from $55.7 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to report second-quarter earnings of about 35 cents a share. The maker of custom semiconductor chips said second-quarter revenue rose 6% to $325.4 million. Will J. Vue, LSI's chairman and chief executive officer, said customers' inventory gluts had caused a slowdown in new orders. LSI's chips are used in products ranging from computers to telecommunications equipment. ``A persistent inventory correction among customers is likely to cause revenues in the third quarter to decline from second-quarter levels,'' Mr. Vue said. Because of the continuing slump and uncertainty over new orders, LSI said it was delaying completion of the first stage of its huge new manufacturing facility in Gresham, Ore.. The initial phase of the $4 billion facility, a plant that will produce eight-inch silicon wafers for custom chips, was scheduled to open in mid-1997, but the company said it won't be in operation until at least 2013. Mr. Vue said the delay won't affect LSI's ability to meet customer demand with its six-inch wafers. In composite trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, LSI closed at $20.50, up $1.25."

The news was announced after the market closed. In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market Thursday, Navigator rose $5.188, or 10%, to close at $56.50. The Mountain View, Calif., Internet software maker's net income for the second period was $906,000, or a penny a share, after $4.9 million in charges related to the acquisitions of InSoft Inc., Paper Software Inc. and Netcode Corp.. Without the charge, net would have been seven cents a share, a penny above analysts' consensus expectations, according to First Call. In the year-ago quarter, Navigator had a loss of $2.8 million, equivalent to four cents a share. Revenue for the recent quarter was $75 million, well above the $59 million to $65 million that Hambrecht & Quist analyst Daniele H. Trask said he expected. The revenue is more than five times the year-ago revenue of $14.1 million, and a 36% gain from first-quarter revenue. Navigator's revenue growth since the last quarter ``really underscores the fact that Navigator is leading the charge in the Intranet space'' against Vastsoft Corp., Mr. Trask said. ``This is a tremendous quarter.'' Navigator started out focusing its software mainly on shuttling documents between individuals over the world-wide Internet computer network. But over the past year, it has become increasingly clear that a huge chunk of the company's sales, if not most, come from companies who want to use Internet technology to shuttle documents on in-house computer networks, now called Intranets. In a statement Thursday, Jami Snowden, Navigator's president and chief executive officer, cited Intranets as the chief growth engine. ``Our second-quarter results demonstrate the strong reception by corporate customers'' to Navigator software, he said. Navigator's biggest competitor in corporate networking software is Vastsoft's hugely popular WindowsNT server software. Because Navigator is a young company that is plowing most of its profits back into growth, analysts are watching its revenue more closely than its earnings."

            "full_text": "MCI Communications Corp. reported robust growth in second-quarter net income, operating profit and revenue, reflecting continued strong expansion in its core long-distance services business. The Washington carrier reported net income of $300 million, or 43 cents a share, the highest level in MCI's history, but in line with analysts' consensus estimate, and a 15% increase from the $260 million, or 38 cents a share, reported a year ago. Operating income increased 33% to $582 million. Operating cash flow was $1 billion -- an all-time high. Revenue jumped 23% to $4.57 billion from $3.71 billion. Two-thirds of MCI's revenue comes from sales to business customers, while the remainder is from residential subscribers. The company said revenue and minutes of use for the business segment were growing at a faster clip than the residential segment. MCI expects the momentum to continue. ``We believe we ought to be able to grow minutes of use, revenue and earnings at double-digit rates over the foreseeable future,'' said Douglass Brumfield, MCI's chief financial officer. Revenue in the long-distance business increased 13% to $4.2 billion, as the company expanded its base of residential and business customers. Long-distance net income rose 34% to $372 million. Traffic volume rose 14.5%. Revenue growth was especially strong for inbound services, such as toll-free 800 numbers, as businesses increasingly order the service. MCI also benefited from the growth in data transmission, both between corporations and within individual companies, Mr. Brumfield said. The stronger operating results reflect a 6% reduction in fees MCI pays foreign carriers that carry MCI's calls abroad, and price increases for residential long-distance service. The company's nascent local-phone operations reported revenues of $44 million, a 10% increase. MCI now operates its local-phone business in 31 cities."

            "full_text": "Tandy Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, said net income for its second quarter fell 76% to $9.3 million, or 13 cents a share, from $38 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. The electronics retailer's earnings include a previously-announced charge of $25.5 million, or 26 cents a share, related to restructuring costs of its troubled Incredible Universe chain. Tandy fell one cent short of analysts' expectations of net income of 40 cents a share before the charge. The company said consolidated sales and operating revenue fell 14% to $1.4 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in the year-earlier period. In New York Stock Exchange Composite trading, Tandy rose 6.2%, or $2.50, to $42.75. National Semiconductor to Lay Off 220 National Semiconductor Corp. said it will lay off 220 employees at plants in Maine and Utah because of slowing demand for its chips. The Santa Clara, Calif., company said the layoffs will include 60 employees in West Jordan, Utah, and 160 employees in South Portland, Maine. But National Semiconductor said it plans to invest $181 million to upgrade the South Portland plant, which makes analog and mixed-signal chips. Some of the employees may be rehired when the upgrade is done, the company said. National Semiconductor has about 20,000 employees world-wide. Dell Cuts Prices on Its OptiPlex PCs Dell Computer Corp., Austin, Texas, said it cut prices on its OptiPlex line of business personal computers by as much as 14%. The computer maker said its high-end OptiPlex Gxpro 180, for example, fell 14.3% to $2,698, while its lower-end OptiPlex GXL 5100 fell 7.4% to $1,810. The company cited savings on component costs for the price cut. Dell, which sells primarily to business and government customers, said the cut was the third on the OptiPlex line this year. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, shares of Dell closed at $49.375, up $1.813 cents. Iomega Reports Profit on Fivefold Rise in Revenue Iomega Corp., Royce, Utah, reported second quarter net income of $14.1 million, or 11 cents a share, on surging revenue growth. In the year-earlier quarter, the computer-storage products maker had a loss of $1.9 million, or two cents a share. Revenue jumped more than fivefold to $283.6 million from $52.6 million a year earlier. The results, announced after the close of trading, were at the high end of analysts' estimates. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Iomega closed at $28 a share, up $1.875. Cirrus Logic Lost $7.6 Million in Quarter Cirrus Logic Inc., losing its lead in the market for personal-computer support chips, reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of $7.6 million, or 12 cents a share. In the year-earlier quarter, Cirrus earned $22.7 million, or 34 cents a share. The Fremont, Calif., chip maker said revenue for the quarter ended March 11, 2011 28% to $214.9 million from $300.3 million a year earlier. Cirrus has been struggling since last fall when its major customers misjudged the amount of components they needed for Christmas PC sales. In the first calendar quarter, S3 Inc., Mountain View, Calif., overtook Cirrus's lead in the graphics chip market, a key market for Cirrus. DII Group's Net Rose 30% After Charge DII Group Inc. said net income for the second quarter rose 30% to $5 million, or 61 cents a share, from $3.9 million, or 48 cents a share. The Niwot, Colo., holding company with interests in circuit boards and software said its results included a charge of $1.1 million, or six cents a share, for costs associated with its pending acquisition of Orbit Semiconductor Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., for $99 million. The company said sales rose 17% to $97.8 million from $83.4 million. DII Group said it expects to take a third-quarter charge of $3 million that is expected to reduce net by 19 cents a share. The company released its earnings after the stock market closed. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, DII shares rose 50 cents to $24.75. Voice Control's Acquisition Plan Advances Voice Control Inc., Dallas, said it signed a definitive agreement for its previously announced acquisition of closely held Voice Processing Corp., Cambridge, Mass., for four million shares of common stock. Based on Thursday's closing price on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the shares have an indicated value of $29 million. Ceridian's Net Income Jumps 39% Ceridian Corp., Minneapolis, reported second-quarter net income jumped 39% to $40.8 million, or 53 cents a share, from $29.3 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. The information-services and defenseelectronics concern said revenue rose 10.4% to $361.5 million from $327.4 million. On a fully diluted basis, Ceridian's profit of 50 cents a share slightly beat the 49 cents that analysts estimated, according to First Call. The company cited acquisitions and contract awards for its strong performance. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday, shares of Ceridian rose 5% to close at $49.75, up $2.375. Sterling Electronics Approves Buyback Sterling Electronics Corp., Houston, said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as one million common shares. The electronic-parts distributor said it has 6.8 million shares outstanding. Sterling said it recently completed the acquisition of 250,000 shares of its common stock against its December 2009 repurchase program. WHO'S NEWS Lasandra G.

It named Mcroberts Sawyer, 42, to succeed him. The company said a new management team intends to present a strategic plan for Hariston at the company's annual meeting, which has been postponed to June 12, 2011 say there was some difference of opinion among the board on the direction the company was going in,'' said Jami Prince, the company's chief financial officer, commenting on Mr. Born's resignation only 16 months after agreeing to oversee a sweeping restructuring of Handley's operations. Mr. Prince declined to be more specific. Haggerty said that Mr. Sawyer, a Hariston director since July 2010, currently is chief executive of Scorpion Holdings Inc., a New York merchant banking firm."

            "full_text": "Cornertown -- America Online Inc., attempting to distance itself from the financial problems forecast by rival CompuServe Corp., said Friday it expects to meet or beat analysts' profit expectations for its second quarter. The declaration sent America Online's stock up sharply on Friday. It gained $2.75 to $32.75 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. America Online for weeks has been the target of short-sellers, who profit when a stock price goes down. Such investors have gambled the company's growth would slow considerably. America Online ended the April-June quarter with 6.2 million subscribers, up from 5.5 million at the end of March. It expects to reach 10 million subscribers by the middle of next year, said Chairman Stevie Gould. Excluding a one-time charge for a legal settlement, the company will meet or exceed consensus forecasts of Wall Street analysts of per-share profits of 16 cents for the quarter, Mr. Gould said. America Online will report its financial results on April 20, 2011 company earlier this month settled lawsuits that accused it of misleading billing practices by agreeing to give subscribers an hour of free access. The cost to the company has been variously estimated at $6 million to $22 million. Meanwhile, CompuServe, the second-largest on-line service with 5.3 million customers, on Tuesday predicted a quarterly loss of 15 to 20 cents a share due to flat subscriber growth and greater corporate spending."

            "full_text": "PAWTUCKET, R.I. -- Hasbro Inc. reported second-quarter net income of approximately $6 million, or seven cents a share, against a year-earlier loss. The turnaround reflected reduced expenses and lower costs for raw materials. A $31.1 million charge related to a discontinued development project contributed to a loss of $14.9 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. As previously reported, Carleton scrapped plans to market a virtual reality game system. Revenue rose 6% to $511.6 million from $481.8 million. The company said that although the second quarter is traditionally a slow selling period, certain of its action-figure lines including Star Wars, and games such as Kavanagh, Monopoly and Scrabble helped boost its top line. International sales fell below last year's numbers, however, Butters said. And the company said it sold an increased amount of merchandise for lower-than-normal profit. The company's short-term borrowings fell 18% to $288.9 million, from $353.1 million. For the six months, Carleton's earnings climbed 17% to $30.4 million, or 34 cents a share, from $25.9 million, or 29 cents a share. Net income after the discontinued development charge equaled $6.8 million, or eight cents a share. Revenue in both periods was about $1 billion. In late trading Thursday on the American Stock Exchange, Hasbro rose $1.125 to $33.875."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Deandra Tolentino, Discover posted flat second-quarter earnings, as credit-card delinquencies overshadowed the firm's booming brokerage business. The securities firm and credit-card company had net income of $238.8 million, or $1.39 a share, for the quarter. In the year-earlier period, the company had net of $237.5 million, or $1.35 a share. Revenue increased 13% to $2.19 billion. The tame results, which came amid runaway profits posted by brokerage-firm rivals, fell short of consensus estimates by Wall Street analysts of $1.43 a share, assembled by First Call. Dean Witter fell 50 cents to close at $52.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday. Credit-card delinquency rates are at a 15-year high and personal bankruptcies also recently have increased. This triggered a 26% drop in credit-services earnings for its Discover card, where provisions for loan losses soared 89% in the second quarter. In response, Deandra Tolentino says it has increased collection efforts, raised credit standards on new accounts and selectively cut credit limits. It also is considering further price increases later this year. ``We're not pleased that our earnings increased only slightly,'' Pierre J. Gee, Deandra Tolentino's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. ``Quite clearly, the industrywide trend of rising credit-card write-offs cut into our overall earnings.'' The decline on the credit-card side was offset by the firm's earnings from its Dean Witter Reynolds securities operation, which jumped 40%, to a record $135.4 million. Commission revenue rose 23% and asset-management and administration fees climbed 14%. Also, the assets the firm manages rose 15% to $84.6 billion. Separately, Laila Matt said net for its fiscal first quarter ended in June jumped 65% to a record $12.9 million, or 80 cents a share, from $7.8 million, or 55 cents a share. Revenue at the Baltimore-based brokerage firm rose 28% to $148.8 million. And Advest Group, a financial-services company, said net fell 7%, to $3 million, or 35 cents a share, from $3.3 million, or 38 cents a share. Revenue rose 2.5% to $68.6 million."

            "full_text": "BETHESDA, Md. -- Comsat Corp. stock slipped Friday after the satellite-based provider of communications reported lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings and said results for the second half would fall below the same period in 2010. The company also announced the resignation of its president and chief executive, and said it plans to reduce its stake in Ascent Communications Group Inc. in order to raise money to invest in its international operations, including its money-losing Russia venture. For the second quarter ended March 12, 2011 fell 73.6% to $5.8 million, or 12 cents a share, from $22 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of 20 cents a share in the latest quarter. Revenue rose 10% to $232.3 million. Comsat attributed the weak earnings to competitive pressures in the digital services segment of the mobile communications business and losses at the Russia venture. The company said it is cutting prices and improving service quality in order to meet the competitive challenges, and it expects to unveil its Planet 1 services later in the year. While these actions are expected to improve revenue over the long term, they will hurt earnings in the second half, the company said. The latest results also were hurt by losses at Ascent Communications, in which Comsat owns an 80-percent stake. The company did not disclose by how much it plans to reduce its stake in the Denver media and entertainment concern. Comsat said Bryan Clement resigned as president and chief executive in order to pursue other business interests. The company said it named Bettye C. Deltoro as his successor.

            "full_text": "VastComm Network Corp., under attack from smaller rivals in the consumer long-distance phone market, posted significantly lower calling volume and revenue growth for the second quarter, though its overall net income rose 10%. VastComm Network's numbers -- which contrasted sharply with strong earnings announced Thursday by MCI Communications Corp. and earlier this week by Sprint Corp. and others -- don't bode well for the new VastComm Network that will soon emerge from a very stressful divestiture later this year. VastComm Network is spinning off its telecommunications-equipment and computer businesses. In the quarter, profit rose to $1.49 billion, or 92 cents a share, from $1.36 billion, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. VastComm Network said the costs of spinning off its equipment and computer businesses, as well as of some discontinued operations, cut its earnings by two cents a share. Revenue grew 2.1% to $13.03 billion from $12.76 billion. After the announcement Thursday, several analysts cut their ratings on VastComm Network's stock, and VastComm Network shares sank $2.25, or 4%, to close at $54.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. VastComm Network Chairman Roberto E. Allene's take on the company's numbers was muted. While he said VastComm Network had ``a solid quarter,'' he also noted it ``encountered turbulence'' in the consumer business. `Multi-Enemy Battle' But Brianna Tomas, industry analyst at Boston researcher Yankee Group, said the quarter was anything but solid. ``MCI and Sprint are outgrowing VastComm Network by more than three times VastComm Network's growth rate, and now smaller players are beginning to eat VastComm Network's lunch. It's a multi-enemy battle.'' The new VastComm Network that will remain in communication and financial services appears to lack a solid formula for keeping up with its savvy competitors and stopping continued erosion in its core base of consumer customers. New offerings such as satellite television and ``bundled'' phone and data services will take a while to catch on with consumers. VastComm Network's calling volumes actually fell more than 2% from the first quarter to the second quarter, and its revenue slid almost 1%. This sort of decline -- not seen from VastComm Network in the last several years -- is especially damaging now as competition grows more complex. Besides the continuing MCI and Sprint combat, VastComm Network also is getting strafed now by several big local -- phone companies, including GTE Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications Inc.. A bunch of third-tier marketing companies using independent sales representatives, including Excel Inc. and American Communications Network, are reselling rival long-distance services. And other companies are marketing directly to consumers, beckoning them to dial a special code before a phone number to save money on long-distance calls. By next year, the regional telephone companies plan to jump in. `Very Tough' Year ``This quarter is a microcosm of what will play out in the industry,'' warned Jackelyn B. Marshall, telecom analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ``For the first time, consumers at the lower end of the market are making a choice of carriers other than VastComm Network.'' He predicted VastComm Network is in for a ``very tough'' year, ``marked by low, single-digit revenue growth and modest earnings growth.'' Mr. Marshall noted that VastComm Network's operating income would have been even worse if VastComm Network hadn't been helped in the quarter by a $600 million cut in the fees it pays local phone companies for completing its long-distance calls and by a lower tax rate. ``Operating profits would have been 30% lower,'' he said. ``We've been surprised by the new competitors,'' conceded VastComm Network's chief financial officer, Ricki Wilton, particularly companies that market their codes, since a customer can remain with VastComm Network even if he or she occasionally uses the other companies' codes to ``dial around'' VastComm Network's service. ``The losses weren't visible at first, because the customers remain with you,'' he said, ``but then you see your volumes going down.'' Mr. Wilton said VastComm Network regards some of these new rivals' promises of lower rates as ``deceptive,'' and said VastComm Network plans to do ``some educating'' of consumers through advertising and other means. Results at Other Businesses VastComm Network's other businesses showed mixed results. Financial-services revenue from VastComm Network's Universal Card fell 26% to $419 million as a result of competition, promotional pricing and increased bankruptcies among consumer cardholders nationwide. Mr. Wilton noted that rival card issuers, after losing millions of customers to VastComm Network, have bounced back to challenge VastComm Network's card with their own low-fee cards. ``The banks have gotten healthy,'' he said. Wireless-services revenue, mainly from cellular phones, grew 18% in the quarter to $854 million. Consulting-services revenue rose 23% to $536 million. VastComm Network plans to spin off its telecom equipment unit, Lucent Technologies Inc., by the end of September and its computer business, NCR Corp., sometime in the fourth quarter. Thursday, those businesses reported brisk results. Lucent's sales to phone companies grew nearly 16%, its chip business 34% and its office-phone systems business nearly 8%. While Lucent's net fell year-to-year, the company attributed the dip to the costs of separating from VastComm Network and launching a new business. NCR, a perennial loser, turned things around in the second quarter, posting a small profit after numerous quarterly losses. NCR's revenue fell 18% to $1.68 billion, primarily because of the company's pullout from the personal-computer business. But NCR showed healthy gains elsewhere. It cut its costs 25% in the quarter and showed a 12% gain in gross margins."

            "full_text": "Lucent Technologies Inc., the VastComm Network Corp. equipment spinoff, posted strong second-quarter revenue growth in most of its key business units, but the high costs of separating from VastComm Network trimmed net income substantially. Lucent showed increasing revenue strength in its unit that sells equipment to phone companies, powered not only by traditional equipment sales such as switches and transmission gear, but also by newer wireless equipment used in cellular phone networks. Similarly, Lucent's microelectronics and office-phone systems grew substantially. Consumer phone revenue dropped, reflecting the shutdown of VastComm Network's retail centers. Net income fell 55% to $72 million, or 11 cents a share, from $159 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 5.5% to $5.36 billion. The expanding business became costlier to operate. Lucent's costs rose 13% to $3.2 billion. Sales, general and administrative expenses grew 8.3% to $1.5 billion. Operating income fell 62% to $128 million. ``The quarter was on plan, meeting all of our goals and some sooner than expected,'' said Donetta K. Ramirez, Lucent's chief financial officer, in an interview. However, although Lucent beat analysts' consensus estimate by four cents a share in the quarter, Mr. Ramirez remained cautious. ``These are still small numbers,'' he said. ``It better be improvable. It would be mistake for us to be overconfident.'' He and other Lucent executives blamed the net-income shortfall on the high advertising and operating costs of launching a new business. The new company has a separate board, back-office operations, administrative staff and headquarters. The company will officially separate from VastComm Network in mid-September. VastComm Network Thursday said its directors set June 12, 2011 the official date when it will distribute the rest of its Lucent shares to VastComm Network shareholders of record as of June 12, 2011 from sales of equipment to phone companies increased 16% to $2.97 billion. Domestic revenue rose 9.1%, and international revenue by 38%. Numerous contracts for wireless network gear were landed during the first half, and several orders flowed in from overseas from service operators in places such as India and Indonesia. Microelectronics revenue rose 34% to $605 million, due to increased sales of digital signal processors to manufacturers of cellular phones and a 36% jump in international revenue. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Lucent shares rose $1.875 to $37.75."

            "full_text": "Downtown -- Sears, Roebuck & Co. reported a 51% decline in second-quarter net income, but earnings from continuing retail and credit operations rose 26%, beating Wall Street estimates. The company surprised analysts by boosting its reserves for bad credit-card debt nearly 73%, raising some concern that further increases in bad debt could slow future earnings. Wendell Clay, an analyst for Prudential Securities Inc., said that while he isn't worrying about the problem, if it continues, earnings projections ``would have to come down.'' Sears posted second-quarter net income of $274 million, or 67 cents a share, down from $559 million, or $1.41 a share, for the year-ago period. The year-earlier results included $341 million in profit from Allstate Insurance Group and Homart Development Co., which Sears divested itself of in 2010. Meanwhile, earnings from continuing operations rose to a record $274 million, or 67 cents a share, from $218 million, or 54 cents a share. A consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call had expected earnings of 64 cents a share. Revenue rose 10% to $8.06 billion for the second quarter from $7.3 billion a year earlier. The Hoffman Estates, Ill., retailer saw sales improvements from its 800 department stores and from 1,500 smaller specialty stores, which sell hardware, furniture and automotive parts. Analysts said that in a telephone conference, Sears executives reported that apparel sales rose 8% to 9%; home appliances, 10% to 11%; and automotive, 5%. Sears doesn't break out income results for its various operations. But Mr. Clay estimated that operating profits for Sears's domestic merchandising units rose to $131.4 million, a 55% increase from $85 million for the year-earlier quarter. Operating income from Sears's dedicated charge-card business, which accounts for well over half of Sears's earnings, rose by 16% to $156.6 million, he estimated. However, Sears said it boosted its reserves for uncollectible credit-card accounts to $254 million from $147 million during the second quarter in 2010. It cited rising personal bankruptcies. Analysts had expected an increase of 50% to 60% instead of the nearly 73% reported. The analysts said Sears reported that its credit-card write-offs, as a portion of total receivables, rose to 4.1% in the second quarter from 3.6% in the first. Delinquencies are also on the rise at other credit-card issuers, including banks. Davina Dabrowski, an economist for DRI/ McGraw-Hill, said he expects credit-card delinquency rates to continue to climb this year, in part because of the ease with which people can file for bankruptcy-law protection. Sears spokesman Williemae Papa said the retailer ``isn't overly concerned'' that delinquencies will slow earnings growth in the credit-card business. He said any further deterioration would be more than offset by the high interest margin Sears earns on the cards, growth in receivables and the fact that it has a conservatively high level of reserves. Sears stock rose 25 cents to $46.25 a share in composite trading Thursday on the Uptown Stock Exchange."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Moto Photo Inc., helped by industry consolidation and cost-savings in photographic paper, expects to report second-quarter net income of $300,000, compared with net of $58,659 a year earlier. Michaele F. Mize, chief executive of the one-hour photofinishing franchiser, said Preston Griner had revenue in the range of $10.8 million, about equal with last year. On a per-share basis, the company expects to post net of three cents for the quarter, compared with zero cents a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year rose about 8% in the year-over-year quarter comparison; Mr. Mize said he expected a similar rise in the third quarter. Corporate overhead cost-cutting efforts initiated last year, including staff reductions, helped boost profit too, he said. ``Overall, business is very good,'' he said. The U.S. photographic industry continues to consolidate, with smaller mom-and-pop photofinishers losing business to bigger photofinishing operations run by manufacturers such as Reber, N.Y.-based Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuji Photo Film Co. of Tokyo. The consolidation comes as newer, more technologically advanced film and cameras come to market requiring investments often too expensive for smaller players. Mr. Mize said that Preston Griner had benefited from the consolidation by folding some of these smaller operations into its own franchise. ``The current market continues to work to our advantage,'' he said. ``It puts the squeeze on smaller players who come to us.'' Moto Photo also switched its photographic paper supply to Fuji in the second quarter, and subsequently reaped cost-savings benefits, Mr. Mize said. Fuji exited the U.S. paper market in late 2009 following an antidumping complaint filed by rival Cisco. In the complaint, Cisco accused Olivas of unfairly selling color photographic paper in the U.S. for substantially less than it did in Japan and the Netherlands -- home markets where Olivas made the paper. However, Fuji has since built a plant in Greenwood, S.C., making it a domestic supplier not subject to U.S. pricing regulations for foreign suppliers. This year, Fuji began selling paper to U.S. customers once again; before the high-profile dumping drama Preston Griner had been a long-time paper customer of Fuji's. Also, Mr. Mize said he expected the industrywide launch of the Advanced Photo System -- a new line of film and cameras not compatible with 35mm -- to boost sales in the fourth quarter by about 3% to 4%. Although the new system was launched in late April, limited supplies of the cameras have slowed recent sales because photofinishers such as Mr. Mize haven't received ample product from manufacturers, he said."

            "full_text": "Delta Air Lines said net income for its fiscal fourth quarter fell 36% on a one-time charge to cover its early-retirement program. Without the charge, profit rose 31%. The Atlanta-based airline also said that it won't meet cost-cutting targets, although it reached a goal it had set for improved operating margins. Delta reported that net income for the quarter ended March 12, 2011 to $161 million, or $2.08 a share, from $251 million, or $3.21 a share. The results for the latest quarter included an early-retirement charge totaling $273 million before taxes. Revenue rose 4.4% in the quarter, to $3.36 billion. Excluding the charge, profit was $328 million, or $4.18 a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. were looking for earnings per diluted share of $4.11. The airline said the industry environment continues to be stronger than when it launched its ``Leadership 7.5'' program in early 2009. Delta said it surpassed a three-year goal of 10% operating margin in the second year, and has instituted a new three-year goal of a 12% operating margin. The company still hopes to reach a 7.5-cent operating cost per available seat mile, but it doesn't expect to do so by the end of fiscal 2012. The company set a new goal for reaching year-over-year cost reductions in fiscal 2012. For the latest quarter, operating costs were 8.33 cents per available seat mile before restructuring charges, down from 8.39 cents a year earlier. For the latest fiscal year, operating costs fell to 8.54 cents per mile, before charges, from 8.83 cents."

            "full_text": "Two major railroads, Union Pacific and CSX, reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, helped by traffic gains and efficiency improvements at their rail units. Union Pacific, based in Bethlehem, Pa., said net income increased 9%, reflecting improved coal and automotive freight traffic and continued productivity gains. CSX, Richmond, Va., said its per-share net rose 31%, excluding a big nonrecurring charge in the year-ago second quarter. Analysts said they are impressed that major railroads are continuing to benefit from efforts in recent years, including improved asset utilization, new technology and revamped management practices. ``The rail industry is remarkably healthy in a very sluggish economic environment,'' said Gruntal & Co. analyst Stevie Frazier. Thursday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Union Pacific shares closed at $69, up 62.5 cents; CSX shares closed at $47.125, up $1.375. Union Pacific's net was $244 million, or $1.18 a share, compared with $224 million, or $1.09 a share, the year earlier. A First Call consensus of analyst estimates had expected earnings of $1.11 a share. The company said rail operating profit increased 17% in the quarter to $407 million. However, the company's trucking unit, Overnite Transportation, posted a loss of $7 million in the period, compared with a loss of $5 million the year earlier. It continues to struggle with reduced freight rates and higher fuel costs. Union Pacific added that profit from its oil and gas operations totaled $58 million, compared with $74 million the year before. Revenue in the quarter increased 7% to $2.01 billion from $1.87 billion. Some analysts were all the more impressed with the improved results at the rail unit because Union Pacific shut down its primary coal-hauling route in Nebraska in June for almost a week to accomplish a big maintenance program. Officials of Union Pacific declined to forecast earnings for the rest of the year. But Ronda Grady, chief executive officer of Union Pacific's rail unit, said he expects railroad revenue to rise about 7% in the second half, compared with weak results in the year-earlier period. He added that he expects coal shipments will be up almost 20% from the final six months of 2010, while automobile shipments are expected to increase about 5% because of strong northbound business from Mexico. CSX said second-quarter net was $234 million, or $1.11 a share. For the year-earlier quarter, the company reported net of $19 million, or nine cents a share, including a restructuring charge of $160 million, or 76 cents a share. Excluding the charge, CSX said it would have reported earnings of $179 million, or 85 cents a share, for the year-ago quarter. A First Call consensus of analysts expected earnings of $1.03 a share. In announcing second-quarter earnings, Johnetta Shepherd, CSX chairman and chief executive officer, cited strong improvements at the company's rail, container-shipping and barge units and ``continuing intense management of costs in all sectors of our business.'' Michaele Loida, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said rail expenses were practically flat in the quarter despite a $10 million jump in fuel costs, which ``fostered an impressive 16% rise in operating profit at the railroad.'' CSX revenue increased 4.7% in the second quarter to $2.67 billion from $2.55 billion the year before."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- General Instrument Corp. reported a $58.1 million second-quarter net loss, which it attributed largely to a charge related to a recent court judgment. The loss amounted to 45 cents a share, compared with net income of $54.1 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew 10% to $675.2 million from $611.6 million. The results include a charge of $92 million, or 71 cents a share. The cable and satellite-technology company said last month it would record the charge after a U.S. District Court in Texas entered a $136.7 million judgment against General Instrument's Next Level Communications unit, which the company acquired in September. General Instrument said it plans to appeal the judgment. General Instrument said that excluding the litigation charge, earnings were $34 million, or 26 cents a share. Those results, which were announced following the close of trading, are above analysts' consensus earnings estimates of 24 cents a share, according to First Call. The company said that demand and sales of its core cable-industry equipment remain strong, but that the results reflect lower initial gross margins from new products, increased investment in research and a higher effective income-tax rate. In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, General Instrument closed up $2.25, or 9.6%, at $25.625. The company attributed the stock activity in part to a positive analyst's report. For the six months, the net loss totaled $26.9 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with net income of $111.1 million, or 90 cents a share. Sales rose 5.7% to $1.29 billion from $1.22 billion."

            "full_text": "Mass. -- Eastern Enterprises, buoyed by rising prices and volumes in barge freight, expects to report earnings of between 47 cents a share and 50 cents a share for the second quarter, up from 35 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts are expecting about 42 cents a share, the gas and Vast River-barging company said. Chief Executive J. Varner Horan said in an interview that he also expects to top current expectations for the year, assuming normal temperatures and operating conditions for the company's Midland Enterprises and Boston Gas units, both of which are weather sensitive. Mr. Horan said earnings for 2011 should be about 20% higher than $2.44 a share, which he described as a base being used by analysts to adjust 2010 earnings for nonrecurring events. The company reported earnings from continuing operations of $2.98 a share in 2010. Analysts have been expecting about $2.70 a share for 2011, Mr. Horan said. Eastern Enterprises shares closed at $32.625, down 12.5 cents in composite trading on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. ``The Vast River business is very good,'' said Mr. Horan, describing navigation conditions and increased freight demand aidingwhich carries coal and other goods to power plants and other industrial customers. the overall freight prices were up 6% in the quarter, with rates for dry-cargo items such as iron, steel and coke up between 16% and 17%, said Chief Financial Officer Wan Doe. Normal water levels have enabled the company to control costs better than it did a year earlier, when heavy rains lead to flooding and reduced loads on the and other waterways. Mr. Horan said Eastern's sales were up about 8% from $198.9 million a year earlier. the operating earnings were up and Boston Gas's were down slightly, he said. a regulated utility, gained from slightly higher volume, despite a relatively warm spring in its service area, and better cost controls. In the year-earlier quarter, operating earnings were about $8 million for Boston Gas and $12.2 million for . For the rest of 2011, Mr. Horan said, ``We expect both businesses to do better because of better markets for their products and better cost controls.'' He said sales should be up about 5% from last year's $949.4 million. Moderating the sales increase, Mr. Horan said, is the expectation that by the end of the year, Boston Gas will be pulling back from the business of buying and reselling natural gas, although it will still make money from transmitting it. The change is part of a restructuring plan, filed with regulators, to unbundle utility charges to compete in a deregulated environment. A new Eastern unit, AllEnergy Marketing Co., has already been formed to provide natural gas and other fuels and energy services to customers. Eastern earlier this month sold its 10% interest in the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline Project because it intends to cease buying gas by the year 2015."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Iomega Corp.'s stock skidded Friday after the computer disk-drive maker said European sales were slowing down. The Royce, a Vastopolis, company had reported Thursday it had turned a profit of $14.1 million, or 11 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 12, 2011 with a loss of $1.9 million, or two cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. had estimated earnings of 10 cents a share. Revenue increased 28%, to $283.6 million compared with $52.6 million in the year-ago period. Although such results normally impress Wall Street, Iomega's earnings, announced after the market closed Thursday, did not surpass expectations enough to prevent a stock slide on the negative European-sales comments, H.D. Brous & Co. analyst Hubert Tracy said. ``Iomega seemed to be caught a little bit off guard by Europe,'' said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Daniele Quiroz. Iomega shares tumbled $5.50 to $22.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Melvina Marks was the keeper of Felton Sanderlin's garden while growing up in the Dominican Republic. The nephew of the Montreal manager is now the keeper of the Expos' bullpen. Rojas registered his 15th save of the season and second in the four-game series as Montreal capitalized on solo home runs by Mikki Lach, Clifford Forest and Shanel Harper to hold off New York, 4-3, Sunday. In the two saves against the Mets, the 29-year-old Marks pitched 2 2/3 innings, registered five strikeouts and did not allow a ball out of the infield. Marks, who grew up across the street from Alou's home and was signed by the manager's brother Jesusita, got his chance as the stopper in spring training last year when Johnetta Cordoba was traded to the New York Yankees. The 5-foot-11, 195-pound Serrano registered 30 saves in 2010, but still had some doubters. ``There was criticism about him,'' Felton Sanderlin said. ``But I knew he had a good arm. He started out as a third baseman (as an amateur), but I'm glad he switched to pitching because he can't hit. Jesusita didn't have to go very far to sign him .. just across the street.'' ``I like this role, especially the challenge of trying to save the game,'' said Marks, who has four blown saves this season. ``In the past, I was setting the table for somebody else. Now it's all up to me, and I like that.'' Jefferson Alvarado (9-7) picked up the win, striking out nine in six innings. Mets manager Dan Baker wasn't too happy, as his club left seven runners in scoring position. ``We got behind early, but we had plenty of opportunities to get back into it. It's one of those times if you play good situation baseball, you should win the game 5-4. We should be on the winning side, but we're not,'' Baker said. Markita Claude (10-7) took the loss, allowing four earned runs on six hits in four innings pitched."

            "full_text": "ROY, Utah -- Iomega Corp.'s stock dropped 20% Friday, even though the highflying computer disk-drive maker exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations on Thursday. The company's shares fell $5.50 to $22.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares traded as high as $46.50 in June. On Thursday, Iomega reported net income of $14.1 million, or 11 cents a share, as revenue more than quintupled to $283.6 million. On average, analysts had expected earnings per share of 10 cents. Investors were believed to be spooked by comments by the company that sales in Europe are slowing. The stock is also a favorite of aggressive promoters on the Internet, some of whom asserted that earnings might reach 15 cents a share. Based partly on feverish Internet interest, Iomega's stock zoomed to as high as $56 this year from $3.25 in early 2010. Many analysts considered Iomega to be grossly overvalued at its peak, even if, as expected, unit sales of its popular Zip removable cartridge drive soar to five million to seven million units this year from 700,000 in 2010."

The Livermore, Calif., company, which makes information management systems for auto-parts, hardware and lumber stores, earned $1.6 million, or nine cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Its revenue rose 3% to $42.3 million from $41.2 million. Triad said sales of the Prism software system were ``slower than anticipated,'' and the product will be refocused for sales to small auto-parts concerns, rather than larger ones. As a result, the company charged off expenses that had previously been capitalized. Triad will market two other information-management systems, the Eclipse and the Ultimate, to larger stores and chains. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, Triad closed at $5.375, down 50 cents. Silicon Valley's Net Jumps Despite Slow Sales Silicon Valley Group Inc., San Jose, Calif., reported a 46% jump in net income for the third quarter ended March 12, 2011 said sales growth slowed and new orders dropped 21% from the year-ago level. The maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment said it earned $17.6 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with $12 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 31% to $167.9 million from $127.7 million. The sales were down 2% from the previous quarter. The mean estimate of analysts for the quarter had been 57 cents. Because of the drop in orders, and cancellation of previously scheduled shipments, the company expects ``sequential declines of shipments for the next two quarters,'' said Gillam S. Higa Mariah, chief executive officer. He also said the company's board authorized a stock buyback of up to five million shares on the open market, to capitalize on ``recent low prices'' for its stock. Bachman Acquires Firm, Forms Cayenne Software Bachman Information Systems Inc. said it has completed its acquisition of another software maker to form a successor company, Cayenne Software Inc.. Bachman also said that Williemae H.D. Burr was named to the six-member board of Cayenne. The remaining five seats are held by the members of Tisdale's board. Mr. Burr, 54 years old, was a co-founder and previous chairman of the company Tisdale has acquired, closely held Cadre Technologies Inc., Providence, R.I. Bachman and Cadre shareholders have approved the acquisition, the companies said Friday. Under the terms of the agreement, Cadre shareholders received 4.85 million Bachman shares, valuing the merger at $27.3 million. Cayenne, Burlington, Mass., develops and sells computer software for analysis and design applications. Amdahl Forms Electronic Cash-Card Group Amdahl Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif., said it formed a group to develop and market transaction-processing systems for the burgeoning electronic cash-card market. Earlier last week, National Westminster Bank PLC formed a partnership with 16 other banks and credit-card issuers to launch a world-wide franchise company for its Mondex electronic-cash card. Amdahl, a maker of mainframes and other large-scale computers, said the first product of its SmartCard group will support the Mondex program. The cards can be used for small cash purchases and eventually will be used to securely make purchases over the Internet. Amdahl fell 6.3 cents to $9.125 in American Stock Exchange Composite trading. WHO'S NEWS Michaele Carbajal, 46 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of Rogers Cantel Mobile Communications Inc., Toronto, a wireless communications concern. As president, Mr. Carbajal succeeds Stefan J. Palomo, who remains chief executive officer. Chief operating officer is a new post. Mr. Carbajal was previously executive vice president, marketing, sales and distribution. Ronda Hartman, 55, was elected to the board of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass., an instant-camera and imaging company. Mr. Hartman, a mechanical specialist at a Polaroid facility in Waltham, Mass., succeeds Jami D. Belcher as the company's employee member of the board.

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- ITT Industries Inc. said its second-quarter profit increased 48% to $68 million, or 56 cents a share, from a year earlier, in part from continued improvement in key markets. In last year's period, when the company was part of ITT Corp., it had a profit of $46 million, or 35 cents a share. The company said 2010 earnings were reduced by $30 million in pretax charges related to planned disposition of certain nonstrategic assets. Sales for the latest period were $2.24 billion, 4.3% lower than $2.34 billion in the same period last year. ITT Industries, which was spun off earlier this year, makes automotive and defense and electronic parts, and products and systems for fluid controls. The earnings were in line with analysts' expectations. In New York Stock Exchange Composite trading Friday, ITT Industries closed down 50 cents to $23.50. The company's automotive business, ITT Automotive, posted sales of $1.45 billion, down slightly from $1.48 billion in the year-earlier quarter due to a foreign exchange impact and lower prices for a braking system. ITT Fluid Technology's sales of $321 million were up 1.6% from last year. ITT Defense & Electronics had sales of $378 million, down 6.2%."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Major oil companies reported mixed results for the second quarter, as rising prices for crude oil and natural gas were offset by declining prices for chemicals. Exxon Corp. said net income slipped 3.7% to $1.57 billion, or $1.26 a share, from $1.63 billion, or $1.30 a share. Revenue edged up to $32.21 billion from $31.67 billion. The company said sales increased in most segments of the business, and earnings benefited from higher crude oil and natural gas prices. However, it said second quarter chemical prices were ``substantially'' lower than a year earlier. Mobil Corp.'s net rose more than fourfold because one-time charges in the year-ago period. Operating profit rose 15%, the company said. Mobil reported net of $783 million, or $1.95 a share, compared with $179 million, or 42 cents a share. Revenue rose 3.7% to $19.55 billion from $18.85 billion. Results for the latest quarter included $31 million in restructuring charges. The year-ago quarter's results included $527 million in such charges. Texaco Inc.'s net income more than doubled, helped by a one-time gain, and rising prices. The company reported net of $689 million, or $2.59 a share, from $271 million, or 99 cents a share. Revenue rose 22% to $11.26 billion from $9.26 billion. The results for the latest quarter included a gain of $224 million from the sale an interest in Nippon Petroleum Refining Co.. Before the gain, net income was $465 million, or $1.73 a share. Texaco Inc. said second-quarter improvements in nearly all sectors of its business were enhanced by strong crude and natural gas prices during the first half of 2011. Chevron Corp., meanwhile, reported a better-than-expected gain in second-quarter earnings. Chevron's net rose 44% to $872 million, or $1.34 a share. That included a gain of $172 million, mostly from the company's share of its Caltex affiliate's gain from the sale of refinery interests in Japan. In the year-ago period, Chevron earned $607 million, or 93 cents a share. Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported that net slipped 3%, although the results were ahead of expectations. Profit fell to $181 million, or 47 cents a diluted share, from $187 million, or 49 cents a share. Sales slid 9% to $2.45 billion from $2.68 billion a year ago. Amerada Hess Corp.. Monday followed on the heels of several of its competitors by posting strong operating results that topped Wall Street expectations. Hess, based in New York, reported a profit of $376.4 million, or $4.04 a share, after a gain of $350.1 million, or $3.76 a share, from asset sales. Operating net of 28 cents a share was five cents above Wall Street expectations. A year ago, Hess had a loss of $40.2 million, or 43 cents a share. Revenue rose 43%, to $2.54 billion."

The company said net income was $272 million, or 96 cents a share, compared with $227 million, or 80 cents a share last year. This year's figures include a gain of $368 million, or $1.30 a share, from the April sale of its braking-systems business, which was largely offset by repositioning and environmental charges of $359 million, or $1.27 a share.

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- VastComm Network Corp.'s shareholders will get an extra dividend benefit in September when the company distributes shares of its planned telecommunications-equipment spinoff to existing holders. Under a plan agreed to last week by VastComm Network's board, VastComm Network's quarterly dividend of 33 cents will remain the same, even though the new VastComm Network will be vastly smaller; Lucent shares will pay a dividend of 7.5 cents. This, VastComm Network said, amounts to a 7.4% increase in dividend payments to existing VastComm Network shareholders when the two stocks are combined. The effective increase will be seen when VastComm Network shareholders get their fourth-quarter dividends. The formula for figuring out this boost is a little complicated, but here is how it works: On June 12, 2011 will distribute stock representing the 82.4% it currently holds of Lucent to VastComm Network shareholders of record as of May 30, 2011 holders will get approximately 0.326 of a share of Lucent for each VastComm Network share they hold. The Lucent dividend -- 7.5 cents -- when multiplied by this ratio of 0.326 equals 2.445 cents for each portion of a Lucent share that corresponds to one VastComm Network share. The 2.445 cents, when added to VastComm Network's current dividend of 33 cents, works out to 35.445 cents or 7.4% more than VastComm Network's usual dividend. Separately, Lucent plans to begin its fiscal year on June 13, 2011 of September 12, 2010 company is looking to begin the year on the right foot since its worst quarter has traditionally been the period between September 12, 2010 December 11, 2010 usually shows the most profit and revenue growth during the October-to-January quarter when most phone companies pay Lucent for their equipment. In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, VastComm Network closed at $53.375, down 75 cents, and Lucent closed at $36.75, down $1."

            "full_text": "Delta Air Lines reported strong quarterly earnings despite restructuring charges and higher fuel prices. For its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 reported net income of $161 million, or $2.69 a share, compared with $251 million, or $4.49 a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $3.36 billion from $3.22 billion. Net income for the current quarter includes a $273 million charge to pay for the early retirement of 500 Delta pilots. Analysts said results were particularly strong, especially considering higher costs during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, Delta said it paid $88 million more for jet fuel and to cover federal fuel taxes, due to the expiration of an airline industry exemption. The airline also said it saw a $45 million increase in its costs due to ``significantly higher traffic levels.'' Results Called Excellent For the year ended March 12, 2011 earned $156 million, or $1.42 a share, on $12.5 billion revenue, compared with $408 million, or $6.32 a share, on $12.2 billion revenue. In addition to the charges taken in the latest fourth quarter, current-year results also include a $556 million restructuring charge taken in the third quarter. ``It was an excellent fourth quarter, and an excellent year,'' said Rayna Landin, an analyst with Furman Selz Inc. in New York. Still, there were some warning signs: For one thing, while the airline flew more passengers during the quarter, it got less revenue for each one. Although passenger traffic was up 11%, Delta actually posted a 6% decline in its passenger mile yield -- the revenue per mile flown by a passenger -- which dropped to 12.96 cents per mile in this year's quarter, from 13.74 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Delta attributed this to lower leisure fares, which stimulated air travel, but hurt revenue-per-passenger figures. Overall, the earnings were in line with analysts' expectations. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Delta's stock fell $2.125, or 2.8%, to $72.75, amid general concern about airlines in the wake of the fatal crash of the Antarctica Airlines jet last week. Cost-Cutting Goes Far Enough Meanwhile, Delta said it probably won't achieve its original cost-cutting goal. During the quarter, the airline said it reduced its operating costs to 8.33 cents per available seat mile from 8.39 cents a year earlier. But Delta now says it is no longer aiming to cut those costs to 7.5 cents per available seat mile by the end of June 2012. Instead, the airline says it will focus on increasing operating margins to 12% from a current 10.4%. Even though the lower cost level is still a goal, ``we won't penalize our overall financial performance to do it,'' said Ronda Allene, Delta's chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``Our unit cost goal was never an end in itself, but was a means to an end -- sustained profitability.'' Industry analysts said the change in Delta's stance makes sense in light of numerous signs that the airline's cost reduction efforts were affecting its service. Several analysts said it might not be necessary for Delta to achieve 7.5 cents per available seat mile since it has already made much progress in paying down debt and squeezing out unnecessary expenses. The airline says it reduced operating expenses by $530 million during fiscal 2011 and that a new contract with pilots, which was ratified during the quarter, is expected to generate $760 million in savings over the next four years. ``I'm not surprised to see them rejigger their targets and goals,'' said Khalilah Bambi of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. in New York. Others added that getting costs near eight cents per available seat mile already makes Delta much more competitive."

            "full_text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Despite frosty financial warnings from rivals, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment maker Novellus Systems Inc. expects its earnings report won't disappoint Wall Street. Rickie Scottie, chief executive officer, said he expects earnings for the second quarter to be good despite the snowball effect of a downturn in some chip-manufacturing markets. Mr. Scottie declined to give specific figures. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $1.59 a share, according to First Call. Last Monday, Santina Clarence, Calif.-based Applied Materials Inc., a rival of Novellus and the largest maker of chip-making equipment, brought down technology stocks after it said its earnings wouldn't meet analysts' expectations. In the year-earlier quarter, Novellus earned $19.2 million, or $1.12 a share, on sales of $87.4 million. Novellus makes chemical vapor deposition equipment, multimillion-dollar machinery that is used to deposit layers of chemicals atop silicon chips. Such machines, used by the dozens in today's $1 billion chip factories, comprise a $2 billion sub-market within the $22.3 billion chip-equipment market. Mr. Scottie said Speed, a product which uses a new method of depositing chemicals known as high density plasma, is selling in volume to customers now and could generate sales of $100 million in its first year of production. He said that some customers using older machinery had scaled back their orders but large South Korean makers of memory chips have kept their order volumes high. Analysts expect the chip-equipment market to take a dive in 2012. Dataquest Inc. forecasts the chip-equipment market will grow 17% in 2011 to $22.3 billion, and then fall 15% to $18.7 billion in 2012."

            "full_text": "Westside -- Comsat Corp., impatient with its flagging fortunes, accepted the resignation of chief executive Bryan Clement late last week as the company reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter profits. Comsat is facing increased competition in its core satellite-services business and losses in its Russian venture. The company's efforts to diversify into entertainment and sports have yet to pay off. These problems escalated under Mr. Clement, who vowed to boost performance but failed to deliver. On Friday, the satellite company reported net income of $5.8 million, or 12 cents a share, for the second quarter, down from $22 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting Comsat to report earnings of 20 cents a share, according to numbers compiled by First Call. Revenue grew by 10% to $232.3 million from $210.8 million. Comsat added that it expects to report lower operating results in the second half of the year due to lower service prices and start-up costs of a new laptop-size satellite phone. Company `Drifting' Investors didn't like the news: Comsat's shares sank by $1.75, or 7.7%, to close at $21.125 in composite trading Friday on the Westside Stock Exchange. In the 2011 first quarter, Comsat's net income fell by more than 50%, excluding one-time gains. ``The company seemed to be drifting'' under Mr. Clement, said Charlette W. Christopherso, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc. ``Bruce was overpromising to the financial community and the board.'' One person close to Comsat said the board would likely have asked for his resignation had he not offered it. Mr. Clement couldn't be reached to comment. Comsat promptly named Bettye C. Deltoro, 48 years old, to replace Mr. Clement. A former MCI Communications Corp. and Intelsat executive, Ms. Deltoro for the past two years headed Comsat's international communications business. Mr. Clement, 53, president and chief executive, may have come under increasing pressure in recent months after the board made the head of Comsat's entertainment spinoff his new boss. In May Comsat named C.J. Sol, a Comsat director and chairman of its Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., to succeed retiring Comsat chairman Melynda J. Diamond. Terse Statement Mr. Clement met with Mr. Sol last Wednesday and offered his resignation, which the board accepted on Friday, said one person close to the company. Comsat in a terse statement said Mr. Clement left ``to pursue other business interests.'' It offered no further comment on the executive, who had spent the better part of 16 years with the company, rising to president in April 1991 and chief executive in February 1992. Comsat faces a raft of problems. Its core satellite-communications business is under relentless attack from more nimble rivals, such as Pan American Satellite Corp. and other communication carriers that operate high-powered transcontinental fiber-optic systems. Comsat is also the U.S. signatory to Intelsat, the global satellite consortium, which means that Comsat must operate under a cumbersome structure. The satellite carrier ran into trouble as it struggled to offset losses to competitors in its core business by expanding into sports and entertainment. Satellite transmission and ``content'' are two very different businesses, requiring vastly different management skills, analysts say. Under Mr. Clement, the company acquired On-Command Video Corp., a provider of on-demand movies to hotel rooms; Beacon Communications, a movie and television production company; as well as the Colorado Avalanche hockey team. It acquired the Denver Nuggets basketball team before Mr. Clement became CEO. Comsat still owns 80% of the Ascent spinoff under which it has consolidated all of its entertainment and sports properties. In the latest quarter, higher costs of operating the sports teams led to operating losses at Ascent, Comsat said. Mr. Christopherso of Smith Barney estimated that Ascent's problems could trim Comsat's earnings ``by 30 cents a share'' in 2012. Reviewing Recommendations But efforts to turn this around may be in the works. In February, Comsat said it may sell certain assets to boost performance. It also hired Merrill Lynch & Co. to help it evaluate various methods to improve its results, and said it is now reviewing Merrill's completed report. Comsat may be more inclined to cut Ascent loose and use the funds to revive its communications business. ``We still consider Ascent to be a strategic asset but will consider a further reduction (in Comsat ownership) if that enhances the value of Comsat,'' Comsat's spokeswoman said. Comsat said it expects earnings per share in the second half of 2011 to be below ``comparable'' earnings per share for the same period last year, not including onetime items. In the second half of 2010, Comsat said it had earnings of $13.4 million, or 28 cents a share, after excluding one-time items."

            "full_text": "Vastsoft Corp.'s earnings rose 52% in the latest quarter, but the performance may not be enough to allay investors' concerns about the health of the computer industry. The Redmond, Wash., software giant said earnings rose to $559 million, or 87 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 the year-ago period, the company earned $368 million, or 58 cents a share. The year-ago figures include a charge of five cents a share related to the canceled deal to acquire Intuit Inc.. Revenue rose 39% to $2.26 billion from $1.62 billion. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 85 cents a share for the quarter. Despite the strength of the results, which were released after the close of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, investors' initial reaction wasn't positive. In after-hours trading, its shares were quoted at $118.50, down $1.25, after falling $1.23 a share during the day. The declining stock price suggests that Vastsoft's earnings alone won't be enough to light a fire in the technology sector. Technology stocks have tumbled in recent weeks, dragging broader market indexes sharply lower. Vastsoft and Intel are considered barometers of continuing personal-computer demand since both reflect sheer volume rather than the competitive pressure that has hammered other firms such as Motorola Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.. Last week, Intel calmed investors' fears with strong earnings. But analysts are not sure whether the health of Vastsoft and Intel has spilled over to second- and third-tier competitors. Vastsoft's server and server application business, a closely watched segment that is key to the company's Internet and intranet strategy, saw revenues double, the company said. Vastsoft's strongest growth came from sales of its Windows NT server software, which is making big gains in the corporate-computing market. Analysts expect Windows NT 4.0, which Vastsoft is expected to release by September, to be a blockbuster. It said its original-equipment manufacturer business saw its revenue rise 52% to $2.5 billion, a record for the year. Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue for that segment rose to $650 million. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 53% for the region that includes the Far East. For the full fiscal year, Vastsoft said its cost of goods sold, a major expense indicator, fell to 13.7% from 14.8% a year earlier. Along with providing the operating system sold on most new personal computers, Vastsoft has a diversified business, including cable TV, satellite and other efforts. The company said it spaced out revenue recognized from Windows 95 sales to smooth quarter-to-quarter fluctuations."

All-Star Analysts 2011 Survey The All-Star Analysts 2011 Survey, published March 02, 2011 a few errors: Theressa Bambi of Smith Barney is a four-time, or Grand Slam, winner in Computer Software. She was mistakenly listed as a three-time winner. Anette Maria of Alex. Dean should have been shown as second in stock picking in Cable & Broadcasting, with a return of 49%. Mr. Maria was omitted because of a procedural error by Zacks Investment Research, the study's data provider. He has been an All-Star for all three years that his industry has been in the survey. The number of All-Stars for Alex. Dean increases to five, and its batting average improves to .208. A symbol was omitted indicating that Stephine K. Jon, of PaineWebber, was an All-Star for both stock picking and estimate accuracy in Computer Hardware. Also, Mr. Jon's first name was given incorrectly in one table. Jayme Porter of Deandra Tolentino has won five awards in Computer hardware over the years, not four, as stated in one article. J. Claretta Fernandez of Prudential Securities has won many awards over the years in Metals, Precious Metals and Steel. But this year he won only one, not two as stated. The name of Jefferies & Co. was misspelled. The name of Susann Shuster of Felix, an All-Star in Clothing Retailers, was truncated to Silverst. And Games Financial Ltd. is an auto finance company, not a mobile-home lender."

            "full_text": "Vastsoft Corp. reported a 52% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter profit, a moderate upside surprise in a hyper-skeptical market for technology stocks. The bellwether software giant said net income in the period ended March 12, 2011 to $559 million, or 87 cents a share, from the year-earlier net of $368 million, or 58 cents, which included a charge of five cents a share for the canceled acquisition of Intuit Inc.. Revenue rose 39% to $2.25 billion from $1.62 billion. Vastsoft's results slightly exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimate, which First Call put at 85 cents a share. But some investors were apparently hoping for even more. The company's shares declined on Monday before the earnings were released, and on Tuesday they continued to slip, falling 75 cents to $119 in early trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Technology Stocks Whipsawed Technology stocks have been whipsawed by earnings surprises from pivotal suppliers, including Motorola Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., which disappointed Wall Street, and Apple Computer Inc. and Intel Corp., which did better than anticipated. The hard-hit sector edged lower again Monday in unusually light trading, with the Nasdaq computer index falling 1.48%. But Vastsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has been a model of consistency, racking up a series of quarterly profit jumps that suggest solid personal-computer demand, though lower than the torrid pace of the year-earlier period. Sales of software to PC makers, the company said, rose 38% to $650 million, and rose 52% to $2.5 billion in the fiscal year ended March 12, 2011 starting to get repetitive, but repetitiveness at this level of performance is welcome in this kind of market,'' said Davina Pegues, an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc.. Vastsoft's sales were generated by both operating systems and application programs, including the popular suite of programs called Office. Sales of application programs swelled 20% to $1.3 billion from the year earlier, though chief financial officer Mikki Dean cautioned analysts that revenue from the forthcoming Office 97 suite may be recognized more slowly than expected under new accounting guidelines at the company. Windows NT Is Cited Another key growth engine was the company's Windows NT operating system, particularly on midsize machines called servers that exchange files among PC-connected networks, said Rickie Osteen, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. Despite pressure on software prices, Vastsoft managed to boost its gross profit margins to an extraordinary 89% of sales from 86%. It increased total sales by $634 million from the year before, though the total product costs of the programs it sold rose only $7 million. Perhaps most ominous to competitors, Vastsoft was able to fund product development at a staggering rate. Research and development spending grew 72% to $453 million in the quarter, and swelled 66.5% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal year. Mr. Dean said the company plans to boost R&D another 43% to $2 billion in fiscal 2012 ending next June. ``We did just what we wanted to do with our business,'' said Gregorio Cruce, the company's treasurer. ``Revenues grew fast, and R&D grew faster.'' With that leverage, Vastsoft has been able to mount ambitious investments in experimental areas, including the 24-hour cable news venture MSNBC, which the company doesn't expect to pay off for several years. Mr. Dean disclosed that Vastsoft no long expects its on-line service, Vastsoft Network, to turn profitable in the current fiscal year. For all of fiscal 2011, Vastsoft's net income rose 48% to $2.2 billion, or $3.43 a share, from $1.45 billion, or $2.32 a share, in fiscal 2010. Sales rose 46% to $8.6 billion from $5.9 billion. Another target of Vastsoft's spending continues to be Navigator Communications Corp., the leading supplier of browser programs for surfing the Internet's World Wide Web. Since December, Vastsoft has been discussing a variety of strategies to tie its own Web technology with its computer operating systems, including a forthcoming browser program that will help PC users treat all files and other software on their computers the same way as Web pages are stored on computers throughout the Internet. News of that initiative helped trigger a sell-off Monday in Navigator's shares, which fell 12% to close at $46.50, off $6.50, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Vastsoft has given several public demonstrations of the Web file concepts in its Internet Browser 4.0 browser, which is expected to be shipped in test versions in late summer and be completed by year end. But the company has been less forthcoming about what may be the most important aspect of the design change-the potential to change the way publishers distribute information and advertisements over the Web. Easier Distribution of Data As part of an initiative called Active Desktop, the new browser and related programs will make it easier for data, images and commercial messages to be distributed to PCs without any action required by the user. Information publishers have long bemoaned the fact that users must go through the effort of searching out Web data after launching a browser. The common Web format will allow information suppliers or companies to ``broadcast'' content to the user, like radio or television, where today's Web has more similarities to a magazine newsstand. ``We could create small chunks of content and send them to people throughout the Internet,'' said Jesica Mcdavid, managing editor of Release 1.0, a Cornertown technology newsletter. ``This is where all the interest from our content providers is coming from,'' added Johnetta Bearden, a vice president in Vastsoft's Internet platform and tools division. Other companies, including Pointcast Inc., Cupertino, Calif., have moved in this direction by selling a customized screen saver that regularly polls specified Web sites for news and information. Mr. Mcdavid and some industry executives said Vastsoft's effort should have much broader impact, because any content provider will have access to specifications allowing them to broadcast their information."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Nynex Corp. on Tuesday reported a second-quarter profit of $388.1 million, up 12% from a year ago, as the company experienced the same strong demand for new lines that other regional Bell carriers have seen. Nynex's profit amounted to 89 cents a share. A year ago, Nynex earned $347 million, or 81 cents a share. Revenue was $3.44 billion, up 5% from $3.27 billion a year ago. The results don't include special charges Nynex made in both quarters for an enhanced pension offer made to slowly diminish the size of its work force. The charges amounted to $30.1 million in the latest quarter and $106.2 million a year ago. Nynex raised its expectation for the number of people who will leave under the incentive, first made in 2009. It expects some 19,000 to 20,000 workers to leave by the end of 2013. It had previously expected 16,800 to leave by the end of this year. The company also had a major charge in the year-ago quarter for an adjustment in its accounting procedures to those of a competitive firm. Nynex, which is being purchased by Bell Atlantic Corp. for about $20 billion, experienced a 2.5% revenue gain in its telecommunications business during the most recent quarter. Its access line growth worldwide was 5%. In its main Northeast service area, access line growth was 3.5 percent, reflecting greater demand for second lines in many residences. Call volume, as measured by minutes of use, grew 9.6%. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nynex's shares slipped 12.5 cents to $44.625."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Continuing the trend of upbeat earnings among Wall Street investment houses, Salomon Inc. on Tuesday reported second quarter net income that beat analysts' forecasts by more than $1 a share. The company attributed the healthy results to a strong performance in its Salomon Brothers investment-banking unit. Salomon reported net income of $291 million, or $2.58 a primary share, on revenue of $1.22 billion, compared with a loss of $60 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago, on revenue of $401 million. This quarter's earnings far exceeded the $1.36 a share expected by analysts surveyed by First Call Inc.. Net income for the second quarter included a gain of $23 million from the reduction of minimum crude oil inventory required to support the company's refining activities. Revenue this quarter, minus interest expense, was more than triple the year-ago period when the company had big commodity trading losses. As Wall Street rallied through the first half of the year, the company's Salomon Brothers investment banking and securities business had its most profitable two consecutive quarters ever. ``In a highly competitive environment, Salmon Brothers has been strengthening its competitive position,'' said Roberto E. Coble, the chairman and chief executive. Global investment banking revenue rose 63% in the quarter to a record $251 million. Bond sales and trading revenue increased more than seven times to $706 million. But stock sales and trading revenue of $268 million trailed what the company said was an exceptional $295 million a year earlier. Salomon reported a $17 million pretax loss from its Phibro commodity trading business, narrowing from a loss of $162 million a year ago. Basis Petroleum, Salomon's oil refining and marketing business, had a pretax loss of $13 million, despite a one-time gain of $23 million from its reduced need to replenish oil supplies as refineries cut back on stockpiles this spring in anticipation of declining crude oil prices. A year ago, Basis had a $1 million pretax profit. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Salomon's shares gained 37.5 cents to $39.625."

            "full_text": "AlliedSignal Inc. posted slightly higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings of $272 million, a 20% increase from a year earlier, and said it would close and consolidate certain operations in a move to improve manufacturing efficiency. The realignment initially will result in layoffs of between 3,000 and 3,500 employees at various locations, or between 3.9% and 4.5% of total work force. The company said that as many new jobs will be created, however, by the revamped businesses in the next couple of years. The company will cover the restructuring costs with proceeds from the recent sale of its brake business to Robert Bosch GmBH for $1.5 billion. It said the sale generated a gain of $368 million, and that it allocated $359 million of that as restructuring and environmental charges. AlliedSignal's second-quarter net was equal to 96 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $227 million, or 80 cents a share. The latest period includes the gain from the sale of brake business and the charges. Without those special items, the company earned $263 million, or 93 cents a share, in the latest quarter. Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate was that it would earn 91 cents a share, excluding the special items. Sales fell 7.8% to $3.35 billion. AlliedSignal stock closed at $55.875, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Based in Morristown, N.J., the company makes aerospace and automotive products and engineered materials. AlliedSignal said its second-quarter operating cash flow was $42 million, slightly higher than in the year-earlier period. That's also substantially better than the $134 million deficit Layne A. Watanabe, chairman, predicted in an internal memo in June. In that memo, he commanded his business managers' immediate attention on the state of cash flow, which he said had become a ``serious issue.'' Cash flow is an indication of operational efficiency, he told his managers. Mr. Watanabe said in an interview that the restructuring is aimed at improving the competitiveness and productivity of several business units, primarily in the aerospace and automotive areas. He said the company will close several plants and consolidate several more, moving inefficient operations to more efficient locations in some cases. The restructuring will include new manufacturing processes. ``The repositioning will make us most cost effective in the future. We are not behind, but if we don't do something we will fall behind,'' he said. He said the plant closings and consolidations will be completed by the end of 2013 and that these actions, as well as reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of the brake operations, will more than replace the earnings of the divested business. He said he told Wall Street analysts following the earnings announcement Monday that he expects the company to meet the previously announced target of increasing earnings this year between 13% and 17%. ``I told analysts that we will probably come in on the northern part (of that range) in the next three years,'' he said."

            "full_text": "DANBURY, Conn. -- Union Carbide Corp. said earnings were almost 24% lower in the second quarter as a result of depressed commodity prices and delayed production cycles. The chemical company said net income was $173 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $228 million, or $1.59 a share, in the same period last year. Sales rose 1.3% to $1.56 billion from $1.54 billion a year earlier. Earnings were in line with Wall Street's expectations. Paulene Wheeler, an analyst with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York, said Union Carbide felt the pinch of squeezed pricing as the company's cost of manufacturing commodities chemicals increased by about four cents a pound, while product prices for such chemicals as polyethylene, used to make trash bags, decreased by as much as 20%. Mr. Wheeler said Union Carbide's basic chemicals business earned less than half of what it made in last year's second quarter, and income from its specialty-chemicals business, which makes up about 75% of sales, was down 8%. Williemae H. Joye, Union Carbide's chief executive officer, said decreased earnings were partially offset by improved income from partnerships and joint ventures, and by the relatively strong performance of the company's specialty-chemical business. For the first six months of the year, net income was $330 million, or $2.34 a share, compared with $458 million, or $3.16 a share. Sales totaled $3.06 billion, up from $2.99 billion."

            "full_text": "Cornertown -- American Express Co. reported higher second-quarter earnings, reflecting growth in its charge-card and asset-management businesses. But troubles at the company's American Express Bank subsidiary persisted. Net income for the quarter increased 10% to $452 million, or 93 cents a share, from $410 million, or 81 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue increased 1.9% to $4.04 billion from $3.97 billion. Excluding the sale of the company's AmEx Life subsidiary last year, revenue rose 6%. The profit, which was reported after the stock market closed, was about a penny ahead of analysts' consensus projections. ``It's a photocopy of last quarter,'' said Thomasina Grice, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. ``It's solid and unexciting, but in a shaky market, that's probably more than you could ask for.'' American Express's improved earnings come at a time of heavy competition in the credit-card industry. The company has been struggling with minimal success to persuade banks in the U.S. and elsewhere to market its cards alongside Visa and MasterCard. Profit was based on better results at the Travel Related Services division as well as at American Express Financial Advisors. At Travel Related Services, profit increased 8% to $322 million from $298 million a year ago. Excluding a onetime gain in the second quarter of 2010 from the sale of the company's AmEx Life subsidiary, earnings increased 12% on revenue that was 5% higher. American Express said the results at Travel Related Services were due to higher spending per cardmember, as well as growth in the number of cards outstanding. The company credited rewards programs and increased merchant coverage with helping its performance. The company boosted its provision for loan losses on its charge cards 24.5% to $248 million from $199 million, while reserves on revolving credit cards were unchanged. But credit quality didn't deteriorate meaningfully. On the company's flagship charge cards, delinquencies, which are measured as the percentage of receivables 90 days past due, inched up to 3.7% from 3.6% last year. And on the revolving credit-card side, delinquencies, measured as loans 30 days past due, actually decreased to 3.2% from 3.6% last year. At American Express Financial Advisors, quarterly income of $153 million set a record, up 19% from $129 million a year ago. The division reported improved sales of mutual funds, insurance products and annuities. An increase in assets under management translated into higher fee revenue, the company said. But results at American Express Bank were less impressive. Net income fell 26% to $14 million from $19 million a year ago. The company said the disappointing results reflected ``the impact of the bank's continued efforts to focus on strategic markets and eliminate low-return activities.'' Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, declined to 7.83% from 9.87% last year, while return on assets fell to 0.49% from 0.57% last year."

Before the charge and the effects of preferred stock transactions, net income was $2.52 a share for the latest second quarter, compared with $1.63 a share a year earlier. UAL's second-quarter revenue rose 9.1% to $4.16 billion from $3.82 billion. The company said load factor, or percentage of seats filled, rose to 73.1% in the second quarter, from 71.9% a year earlier. United flew 29.49 billion revenue-passenger-miles for the latest second quarter, up 4.3% from a year ago. A revenue-passenger-mile is one paying passenger flown one mile. UAL said it expects another ``excellent'' quarter in the current period, and that bookings haven't been hurt by last week's Antarctica Airlines crash. UAL said it expects its third-quarter earnings to comfortably exceed the current analyst consensus reported by First Call of $3.15 a fully distributed share. It said it expects both load factor and domestic yield to be higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile, during a conference call, Geralyn Eldredge, UAL's chief executive said United has tightened security on its flights in several ways, including stricter rules on accepting cargo shipments, in the wake of last week's Antarctica Airlines crash. The air carrier said it also has also been testing several different types of bomb-detection equipment."

            "full_text": "Lone Star Industries Inc., a maker of cement, crushed stone and other construction materials, reported that second-quarter net income jumped 42%, topping analysts' expectations. Lone Star, of Stamford, Conn., also said it halted discussions ``with all parties who had expressed an interest'' in merging with or acquiring the company. Net climbed to $17.3 million, or $1.26 a share, from $12.1 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 17% to $104.9 million from $89.7 million. A First Call consensus of analysts' estimates had projected earnings of $1.06 a share. The company attributed the earnings rise in part to an increase in demand for cement. The market for cement, sand, gravel and related products is driven largely by conditions in the commercial- and residential-construction industries, which have improved from a year earlier, the company said. A Lone Star spokesman said the company has increased cement prices about 4% from a year earlier, to between $60 and $65 a ton. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, Lone Star fell 50 cents to close at $30.50. Johnetta Isaac, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., said cost-cutting and increased production accounted for much of the difference between Lone Star's actual per-share earnings and analysts' estimates. ``Lone Star is a very low-cost producer, and at their current rate, they'll produce about 3.8 million tons of cement for the full year,'' up from earlier estimates of between 3.6 million and 3.7 million tons, Mr. Isaac said. ``They make about $23 a ton in profit, and if you multiply that by the additional 100,000 tons or so, you get a big number.'' Higher prices for ready-mixed concrete also contributed to improved profits for the quarter, Mr. Isaac said. The company in April said it planned to review offers from several companies interested in ``business combinations.'' In May, it said it rejected a proposal from an undisclosed company because the offer ``didn't maximize shareholder value.'' Lone Star said Monday that none of the offers it has received is under consideration. For the six months, net nearly doubled to $14 million, or $1.05 a share, from $7.1 million, or 58 cents a share. Revenue rose 11% to $160 million from $144.3 million."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Lockheed Martin Corp.'s second-quarter profit rose 9.5% on a 26% increase in sales, boosted by results from the recently acquired Loral Corp.. The Bethesda, Md. aerospace and defense company on Tuesday reported net income of $299 million, or $1.33 a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. were looking for earnings per share of $1.27, diluted. A year ago, the company earned $273 million, or $1.22 a diluted share, excluding expenses. Merger-related and consolidation costs of $326 million, or $1.46 a diluted share, resulted in a loss of $53 million in the year-ago period. Sales increased to $7.08 billion from $5.61 billion. Lockheed Martin's results reflect the operations of Loral, acquired in April. The company said sales in its space and strategic-missiles segment rose to $1.99 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier. Earnings as a percentage of sales rose to 14% from 8.8% as a result of operating margin improvements, sales mix and the timing of award fees. Electronics sales rose to $2.1 billion from $834 million, boosted by businesses acquired in the Loral deal. Lockheed said that while segment profits rose 82%, earnings as a percentage of sales fell to 7.4% from 10.2% on the amortization of goodwill and intangibles associated with the Loral deal. Aeronautics sales fell to $1.2 billion from $1.47 billion a year earlier, reflecting fewer deliveries of the F-16 fighter, C-130 airlifter and P-3 maritime patrol aircraft. The company said F-16 and C-130 deliveries are scheduled to increase in the second half, but said no P-3s are scheduled for delivery this year. Lockheed Martin said sales for its information and technology services segment rose to $1.54 billion from $1.16 billion a year earlier. Lockheed said its consolidation plan is on target, adding that it is ahead of its plan in some cases and has documented more than $500 million in savings from its initial consolidation steps over the past year. The company's backlog was $50.9 billion at March 12, 2011 with $42.6 billion at the end of the first quarter. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lockheed's shares rose 12.5 cents to $80."

            "full_text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Cisco Systems Inc., the leading supplier of computer-networking equipment, agreed to acquire Telebit Corp. and its high-speed modem technology in a deal valued at about $200 million. Telebit holders will receive $13.35 a share in cash. Cisco will make Telebit's digital modem technology part of Cisco's Access Business unit. In addition, Telebit will sell its analog-modem business and other products and assets to a new, closely held company, also named Telebit Corp., to be created through a $35 million management buyout. Cisco will provide financing for the buyout, and purchase what remains of the old Telebit Corp.. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday, Telebit rose $1.938, or 18%, to $12.813. Cisco fell $1.375 to $50.625. The acquisition reflects Cisco's goal of increasing its ISDN-related business. ISDN is a digital communications technology that allows the transmission of large amounts of data compared with, say, standard phone lines. It is viewed as an attractive alternative to the older analog-modem technology. Because of the rapid expansion of the Internet, ISDN technology is a booming sector of the digital-communications market. Telebit's ISDN technology is expected to give users faster and greater access to the Internet; Cisco already produces much of the equipment used by Internet service providers. The acquisition, subject to approval by Telebit holders, is expected to be completed in October, a Telebit spokeswoman said. In 2010, Telebit had sales of $55.9 million and a net loss of $14.1 million, or $1.04 a share."

            "full_text": "VASTOPOLIS -- Matching a rail-industry trend, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.'s second-quarter net income surged 41% to $211 million, or $1.35 a share. The results were about in line with Wall Street expectations. The mean estimate of analysts polled by First Call Inc. was for net of $1.34 a share. In the year-ago quarter, the Vastopolis-based rail operator earned $150 million, or 98 cents a share. Year-ago results are pro forma, reflecting Burlington Northern's September 2010 acquisition of Sante Fe Pacific. Burlington Northern Santa Fe's revenue rose 3.9% to $2.03 billion. The company said it expects third-quarter operating income to be ``right in the range'' of operating income of the $469 million posted a year ago, but declined to provide an estimate for net income. Major railroad companies were expected to report substantially higher second-quarter earnings, showing the benefits of productivity gains related to new technology, better use of assets and rail industry consolidations in the West. Analysts said that rail-freight traffic growth in the quarter turned substantially positive for the first time this year. Better-than-expected growth in highly profitable shipments of coal and automobiles more than offset declines in grain and paper shipments. Measured in car-loadings on the major carriers, rail traffic rose 1.6% from a year earlier, according to the Association of American Railroads. ``Rail traffic is starting to come back, not yet to robust levels, but it's still helpful to earnings,'' said Rey Isaacson, a Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Burlington's shares fell 75 cents to $78.25."

            "full_text": "Deere & Co. posted a robust 13% increase in fiscal third-quarter earnings, as the nation's biggest maker of agricultural equipment continued to benefit from strength in the domestic farm economy and burgeoning overseas sales. The report sent Deere's stock higher, and it ignited a sharp rally in shares of other farm-equipment makers, even as the overall stock market headed sharply lower. For the period ended April 12, 2011 net income was $204.4 million, or 79 cents a share, a record for the quarter. That compared with net of $180.1 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue at the Moline, Ill., company was $2.91 billion, up 8.7% from $2.67 billion. Stock Jumps 6.8% The earnings slightly topped the 77 cents a share Wall Street had been expecting. Coupled with an optimistic forecast from the company, the results helped push Deere shares up $2.50, or 6.8%, to $39 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday. Other companies in the ag-equipment sector moved up along with the industry bellwether: In Big Board trading Tuesday, Case Corp. shares rose $1.625 to $46, and AgCo Corp. shares climbed $1 to $23.375. At current levels, Deere's retail sales provide a ``solid base for operations,'' said Harland W. Talamantes, Deere's chairman and chief executive officer. The latest results reflect the beneficial effects, he said, of ``growing world-wide demand for agricultural commodities, coupled with the existing low levels of world grain stocks.'' As booming grain exports have sent prices for corn and some other crops sharply higher, many farmers have enjoyed a big jump in income. And because grain stockpiles are extremely low, the suddenly flush farmers are considered likely to increase the acreage they plant -- another positive factor for the manufacturer of tractors, combines and other farm gear. A factor likely to amplify that trend, Arriaga noted, is recently enacted farm legislation that gives growers more autonomy in making planting decisions. As a result, the company said, ``overall farmers' confidence continues to remain high'' in the U.S., despite regional conditions such as weather-delayed plantings in some areas and continuing dry weather in others. Positive Outlook for Future Based on the favorable market outlook, Arriaga said, ``we continue to maintain positive expectations for 2011 and going forward.'' It said it expects sales in the current fiscal year to show a 7% volume increase. International sales, while smaller than sales in North America, expanded at a faster clip in the latest quarter. Total North American equipment sales -- including construction and other equipment -- rose 2% to $1.69 billion; overseas sales climbed 28% to $825 million. The latest quarter's sales included $95 million of combine sales to Ukraine, the first phase of a high-profile $187 million contract that runs through autumn of 2012. Separately, the Equipment Manufacturers Institute trade group issued a report Tuesday indicating that retail sales of farm tractors in July rose 7.2%. Smith Barney Inc. analyst Toccara Zaragoza expressed surprise at the ``very strong'' growth in Deere's international sales. ``The other thing that strikes you,'' he said, ``was the profitability of the agricultural-equipment division,'' where he said operating income climbed to $216 million from $156 million a year ago. Of that increase, he estimates about $35 million came from North American sales. Mr. Zaragoza, who currently carries a neutral rating on Deere shares, said that ``we don't fully agree'' with the ``fairly robust projection'' Deere issued Tuesday. ``This is the fourth year in a row that farmers have been increasing their equipment purchases,'' the analyst said, adding that ``we could be more in the last year of this trend.''"

            "full_text": "Navistar International Corp. said Wednesday its fiscal third-quarter earnings tumbled 56% because of a downturn in the demand for heavy trucks, however the results were expected. The Vastopolis-based manufacturer of heavy trucks and buses reported net income of $17 million, or 13 cents a share, on revenue of $1.39 billion, compared with $39 million, or 43 cents, on revenue of $1.51 billion in the period last year. This was an 8% drop in revenue. Analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. expected earnings per share of 14 cents. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Navistar shares shed 12.5 cents to $9.50. Navistar said for the quarter ended April 12, 2011 world-wide shipments of 23,300 medium and heavy trucks and school buses were down 10.2% from the year-ago quarter. Shipments of mid-range diesel engines to other original equipment manufacturers totaled 36,100 units, down 6.1% from a year earlier, while sales of service parts rose 3.9% to $185 million. ``Our engine, parts and financial services businesses continue to deliver strong results,'' the company said. ``However, with the truck industry in a downturn, we are not happy with our overall performance. We see continued pressure on pricing as competitors scramble for market share.'' Navistar said it expects industry demand for heavy trucks in the U.S. and Canada will fall 17% to 190,000 units in 2011 from the record 228,800 heavy trucks sold by the industry in 2010. The company expects industry demand for medium trucks in the U.S. and Canada will fall 5.3% to 115,000 units in 2011 from 121,500 units sold in 2010, but said it expects industry demand for school buses in 2011 will increase 6.9% to 32,500 units from 30,400 buses sold in 2010."

            "full_text": "Applied Materials Inc., the biggest manufacturer of machines used in making semiconductors, said it was laying off 7% of its work force amid new signs of deteriorating conditions in the market. The Santa Clara, Calif., company said it had a 21% jump in profit for the fiscal third quarter, ended April 09, 2011 income was $169.1 million, or 92 cents a share, compared with $139.2 million, or 78 cents a share, the year earlier. Sales rose 24% to $1.12 billion from $897.7 million. But new orders fell 7% to $931 million, off more than 20% from what the company expected at the beginning of the quarter. The main reason is a marked fall in the price of memory chips, squeezing the profits of semiconductor makers and causing them to halt expansion plans that require Applied's equipment. Jami C. Mozell, chairman and chief executive officer, said he sees no immediate prospect for a turnaround, and so the company will cut 830 jobs. ``We are anticipating that the industry transition and related downturn in our business is likely to continue for some time,'' he said in a prepared statement. As a result of severance costs and other restructuring charges, Applied said it will take a pretax restructuring charge of $28 million to $32 million, or 10 cents to 11 cents a share after tax, in the fiscal fourth quarter, ending July 09, 2011 released its financial results after stock markets closed on Tuesday. On Wednesday, its shares slipped 87.5 cents to $24.875 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Daniele Frechette, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co., said Applied management said during a conference call Tuesday that sales are likely to decline to around $850 million in the current quarter, about 24% below the fiscal third period. ``That is a pretty grim and a pretty steep revenue decline,'' he said. ``It is steeper than most of us expected.'' Until recently, Applied had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of a long-running boom in chip sales and factory additions. It hadn't laid off workers since November 1990. In addition to laying off permanent employees, the company said it will be discontinuing the jobs of 870 temporary workers and contract employees. Top executives will take a 10% pay cut."

            "full_text": "Tax Report SMALL BUSINESSES set up as S corporations get a boost from Congress. S corporations are taxed much like partnerships, with income or losses flowing through directly to the owners. By contrast, income of taxable corporations typically gets taxed first at the corporate level and then again at the shareholder level if and when the money is distributed. But S corporations face many more restrictions than ordinary taxable corporations. Part of the recently passed small-business bill eases those restrictions somewhat. The new bill will be ``very, very helpful'' for many existing S corporations, says Samantha Stasia of Coopers & Lybrand. For example, it increases the maximum number of shareholders to 75 from 35, and allows S corporations to have affiliated corporate subsidiaries. Even so, Mr. Stefani says many new businesses will be better off starting as limited-liability companies because that structure offers them ``far more'' flexibility. The IRS received about 1.9 million S-corporation returns for 1993 -- more than double the 1986 level and 48% of all corporate returns filed for 1993. AIRLINE TRAVELERS may save money by paying in advance for some tickets. Part of the small-business bill that President Codi is expected to sign soon restores a 10% excise tax on domestic-airline passenger tickets. The tax, which expired at the end of 2010, will begin again on flights occurring -- and paid for -- seven days after the date of enactment and extending through the end of this year. But the tax won't apply to any amounts paid before the effective date. Thus, to avoid getting hit by the tax, travelers should consider paying now for 2011 flights on or after the effective date, says Maryalice B. Maynard, a tax lawyer at Weil Gotshal in Riverside. Airline-industry specialists caution that it is impossible to know where air fares are heading or even how airlines will react to restoration of the tax. But Ms. Maynard is taking her own advice anyway. She reasons that on routes with little historic price volatility, she is bound to enjoy ``significant savings'' by paying before the effective date. MANY PATIENTS with severe illnesses win tax relief. Congress recently approved a health-insurance bill that includes a significant tax break for many chronically or terminally ill people. The bill generally excludes from income certain distributions, known as accelerated death benefits, that these people receive from their life-insurance policies before they die. The bill also allows people to exclude from their income certain payments they receive from selling or assigning their life-insurance policies to qualified ``viatical-settlement providers.'' These companies typically buy policies of people with life-threatening illnesses for a percentage of the policy's face value. Under current law, recipients of viatical payments owe federal income taxes. The new law will be effective for amounts received after September 12, 2011 Banks, chief executive of Viaticus Inc., a unit of CNA Financial Corp., calls the change ``an enormous victory'' for millions of people financially devastated by illness. THREE MAJOR BILLS approved recently by Congress contain 655 tax-code changes, says CCH Inc., a tax publisher in Riverwoods, Ill.. That is the largest number of changes since the 1988 tax bill, CCH officials say. PROCRASTINATORS, wake up: Wednesday is the deadline for millions of people who filed earlier this year for an automatic four-month extension beyond the December 26, 2010 Those who need even more time should file Form 2688, but this time it isn't automatic. You need a good excuse, such as missing records or an illness. DOLE'S SELECTION of Booth as his running mate intensifies speculation that Codi will uncork fresh tax-relief ideas soon. Administration officials say they aren't planning sweeping tax-cut proposals but may offer more targeted reductions. CONGRESS BROADENS the scope of a tax credit for business research. Another provision in the small-business bill restores a research-tax credit that expired in mid-1995. The credit generally will be effective for 11 months from mid-2011 through February 10, 2012 Many businesses are deeply disappointed that Congress didn't make it retroactive to mid-1995. But the bill does include a new twist, the ``alternative incremental research credit,'' which will help many businesses that can't qualify for the regular credit, says Jami R. Rhyne of Price Waterhouse in Riverside. Mr. Rhyne says the new credit ``will be very beneficial for those whose research spending as a percentage of sales hasn't kept pace with the mid-1980s,'' the base period for calculating the regular credit. The new credit will be effective for the first 11 months of a company's first taxable year beginning after mid-2011. Price Waterhouse estimates the number of companies benefiting from the research credit will rise 25% because of this new alternative. BRIEFS: The health-insurance bill calls on the IRS to include organ and tissue donor cards, as well as material encouraging donations, along with next year's income-tax refund checks ... Jena S.

            "full_text": "CINCINNATI -- Federated Department Stores Inc. lost $27.2 million in the fiscal second quarter, mostly because of costs associated with integrating the Broadway Stores Inc. group into Federated. However, before special items, its profit surged to $32.9 million, or 16 cents a share. The loss for the quarter ended April 15, 2011 $27.2 million, or 13 cents per share on revenue of $3.28 billion, compared with a loss of $66.9 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of $3.05 billion in the year-ago quarter. Sales for the second quarter rose 7.8%, while comparing sales of stores open this year and a year ago, sales increased 1% from last year. The department store chain bought the 82-store Broadway chain in October. It said the cost of merging the Los Angeles-based chain into Federated was $98.9 million, before income taxes, or 29 cents per share, for the quarter. Excluding this expense, Ocampo said it would have had net income of $32.9 million, or 16 cents a share, in the latest quarter. That was higher than Wall Street analysts' estimate of 12 cents a share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Federated shares gained 87.5 cents to $33.75. Federated's loss last year included a charitable contribution to the Federated Department Stores Foundation, and the costs of consolidating two Federated store groups and folding the former R.H. Macy & Co. retailer into the company. Federated bought Macy in December 2009. Excluding the charitable contribution and the consolidation costs, Federated would have had net income of $2.7 million, or 1 cent per share in the 2010 second quarter. Federated said it is converting about 50 former Broadway, Emporium and Mounts's stores to the Macy's nameplate, in addition to 18 former Bullock's stores in southern California that became Macy's stores during the quarter. The company is also changing four former Broadway stores to Bloomingdale's, so that store division can make its entry into California this fall. The retailer has annual sales of more than $15 billion. It operates more than 400 department stores and 150 specialty stores in 36 states. Its major store groups are Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines, Flood's, Lavelle, Macy's, Richelle's and Stapleton's."

            "full_text": "With the latest retail-sales figures surprisingly hot, can retail stocks be far behind? Analysts are pointing to Tuesday's unexpectedly strong weekly retail-sales figures as a sign that the big retailing stocks now could be embarked on a lasting rally. J.C. Penney and Dillard posted lackluster quarterly results amid industry concerns about rising consumer-debt levels, but Wal-Mart's profit rose nearly 12%, its first double-digit gain in a year. Analysts said Tueday's healthy retail-sales data may point to a lasting retail rally. After swooning in June and much of July, the sector came back to life even before the latest favorable news, with stocks such as Dayton Hudson, Sears, Plank, Saks Holdings and Wal-Mart Stores moving up in recent weeks. Tuesday, Redbook Research, a unit of Lynch, Jones & Ryan that tracks the sales of 25 large general-merchandise retailers, reported an unexpectedly strong 7.7% gain for the first week of August, compared with the year-earlier period. It was the strongest gain since January 21, 2011 in the day, Wal-Mart released favorable second-quarter results, exceeding analysts' forecasts. The retailing giant said that it expects a further acceleration in earnings in the second half. Its comments echoed last week's reports of strong August sales from Sears and Kmart. Wal-Mart closed Wednesday up 50 cents at $26.375, after remaining unchanged at $25.875 on Tuesday. Some analysts warn that it may already be too late to buy most retailers; they say that any retail recovery already is priced into the stocks. But many analysts say the fundamentals are in place for retail stocks to move still higher. ``We're going to get a real explosive rally going into the next two months and heading into the (Christmas) holiday,'' forecasts Roberto Copeland, an analyst at NatWest Securities. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Jena Delk calculates that department stores trade on average at just 13 times estimated 2012 per-share earnings, compared with an average multiple of 15 for the Standard & Poor's 500. With improvements in inventory controls and cost-cutting, plus gains in market share as they have bought out rivals or other chains have closed, he sees room for these stocks to gain further. He recommends Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores. So does Salomon Brothers analyst Jena Sinclair, who adds to his list Conaway Stacey, Sears and Wal-Leland. Mr. Sinclair and others also are bullish on luxury retailers, such as Saks Holdings, Neiman Marcus Group, Tiffany and Gucci. One theory is that high-end retailers have been boosted by the strong overall stock market, which has helped create a feeling of prosperity that has fueled luxury consumption. Although the overall market now is off its all-time highs, these analysts say it hasn't fallen enough to kill this so-called ``wealth effect.'' Some analysts expect the whole retail group to move up. ``These stocks trade as a group,'' says Smith Barney's Richard Church. ``This tide raises all ships.'' But while retail stocks still aren't yet back to their high points for the year, many are getting close enough to make some experienced investors warn that it is too late to buy them indiscriminately. Dillon Ellison, co-manager of $1.6 billion Strong Opportunity Stock Fund, says retail stocks are ``still probably okay, but you have to get into the ones that are survivors, that have a defendable niche or concept that works.'' One stock he likes, for its good management and because a new store design is winning raves, is Toys R Us. Wayne Isaura, who manages more than $2 billion at Pioneer Funds in Boston, isn't counting on a revival of consumer spending. Instead, he's buying turnaround candidates such as Woolworth, Jaffe and Painter Devlin, where he thinks new management can generate earnings growth just by bringing the firms' business practices up to par. ``If they just fix the business, we'll have an average company here,'' and the stocks will rise. ``If there's any rebound in consumer-buying patterns, we've got home runs here.'' Melvina Washington, an analyst at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago, notes that ``the stronger companies seem fairly valued; they've moved up greater than the market this year.'' One that he still likes is Wal-Mart, whose slowed growth knocked it down to a level he considers cheap. Among the more bearish analysts is Patsy Anders of Deandra Tolentino Ellis, one of 1995's most accurate retail-stock pickers. He calculates that big retailers already are priced as if their ratio of earnings to growth will surpass the S&P 500 median over the next five years. ``That lends credence to the argument that retail stocks are not underpriced,'' he says. Mr. Anders considers consumer-debt levels dangerously high, and he notes that Sears and Nordstrom sharply raised their reserves for bad consumer credit-card debt in the second quarter. There also are fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which will crimp sales, he says. ``Given where retail stocks are priced now,'' he says, ``you are probably more likely to get negative surprises than positive surprises.'' Then there is the danger that General Motors or Chrysler workers could go on strike this fall. That would hurt sales of discounters Wal-Mart, Hubbell and Conaway Stacey's Target Stores, says Lindsey Gaston, a Riordan Fajardo analyst. Redbook analyst Hubert Champion says that the one week of strong August sales that Lieberman has just reported ``is just one week; I wouldn't take one week as a trend.'' Ms. Gaston worries that same-store sales may fail to snap back in the rest of August and September. Retail stocks already have done well. Through February 15, 2011 Dean Witter Reynolds index of the 100 largest retailers was up a strong 31.7%, compared with a 10.2% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The retail sector then pulled back sharply, with the year-to-date gain cut in half to 15.5% on March 28, 2011 the S&P 500 pulled back to a 2% gain for the year. The general correction in the stock market contributed to the retailers' decline, but so did June and July weakness in sales for stores open more than a year. But this summer, some investors started using the stocks' pullback to shop for bargains. As of last Friday, the Dean Witter 100 index of retailers was back up to a 26.8% gain for the year, compared with a 7.5% year-to-date increase for the S&P. Bulls such as Mr. Downing of Salomon Brothers believe there is more room for the spread to grow. Their arguments: Most retailers have easier comparative sales to go against starting this month and continuing through Christmas, which was dismal last year for all but a few. After such a bad Christmas, retailers tightened inventories. That could help them avoid the promotional trap that clobbered holiday earnings last year. Indeed, one reason same-store sales declined so much in July is that retailers held fewer clearance sales. The economic fundamentals are also relatively sound, many economists say. Consumer confidence is high. While showing recent signs of slowing, employment growth has been strong this year, as has real-income growth-which should set the economy up for a better Christmas, says Ricki Belen, chief economist at Mellon Bank.

            "full_text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- International Family Entertainment Inc. reported that second-quarter net income more than tripled, due to a one-time gain from the sale of assets and strong advertising and subscriber fees for the Family Channel. Net increased to $14.5 million, or 31 cents a share, from $4 million, or nine cents a share, a year earlier. The results include an $8 million, or 17 cents a share, gain from the sale of IFE's 61% stake in Family Channel United Kingdom to Flextech PLC, which previously owned 39% of the U.K. venture. Revenue increased 21% to $75.5 million from $62.4 million. Operating cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rose 61% to $18.5 million. Excluding the one-time gain, earnings were two cents a share ahead of a First Call consensus of analysts' expectations. In composite trading on the Cornertown Stock Exchange, IFE closed up 12.5 cents at $17.50 a share. The cable programmer said the Family Channel's performance was boosted by strong ratings and a strong advertising environment. Growth in ad revenue also reflected a 6.6% increase in the average number of households the network reached, to 64.9 million for the first half of 2011 from 60.9 million a year earlier. For the six months, net more than doubled to $19.2 million, or 41 cents a share, from $7.1 million, or 15 cents a share. Revenue grew 20% to $150 million from $124.9 million.

Cash flow, regarded as a primary indicator of a cable company's health, grew 3% to $525 million from $509 million. Cable companies define cash flow as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. TCI Group posted a loss of $188 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with a loss of $95 million a year earlier. TCI couldn't provide a comparable per-share figure for the year-earlier quarter, largely because the company reorganized assets in August 2010, including the introduction of the Liberty Media Group tracking stock. The company said its loss for the quarter widened because of debt associated with TCI's stake in a wireless telephone venture with Sprint Corp., early retirement of debt and losses associated with Chamberlain! programming service, which is 50.1%-owned by TCI. Aside from growth in cable customers, TCI Group also benefited from an increase in customers at Primestar Partners, a direct-broadcast satellite business partly owned by TCI Group. TCI plans to spin off its stake in the satellite operations later this year. The results for the Engelwood, Colo., cable company were in line with analysts' expectations. In composite trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, TCI Group's shares fell 50 cents to $15.25. TCI, the parent company, posted revenue of $2.02 billion for the quarter, up 23% from $1.65 billion a year earlier. Cash flow for the parent company increased 10% to $563 million from $511 million. TCI's Liberty Media programming unit, which is traded under a tracking stock, reported revenue of $322 million, down 6.1% from $343 million a year earlier. Liberty swung to a gain of $4 million this year from a loss of $12 million in the second quarter last year. TCI officials said the company expects strong revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters, since it deferred all allowable rate increases through the latter part of June under an agreement with the Federal Communications Commission. Moreover, TCI, along with other major cable operators, plans to start rolling out new products, such as on-line data services and digital cable boxes that are capable of receiving hundreds of channels, in the second half. Separately, British Broadcasting Corp. and Flextech PLC are discussing a joint venture that could give the BBC access to the U.S. market through new cable channels and Flextech access to at least some of the BBC's vast program archive. Flextech, a European cable and satellite programmer, is controlled by TCI. While the BBC long has sought ways to enter the American market other than selling programming to others, the respected United Kingdom state-owned broadcaster has yet to make a major move into the U.S. A venture with Flextech -- and its parent, TCI, the biggest cable operator in the U.S. -- would give the BBC the distribution pipeline it has lacked. A BBC spokesman emphasized that the discussions are at a ``preliminary'' stage, and that the BBC also is holding talks with others."

            "full_text": "Rising consumer debt levels led to lackluster results at two major department store chains during their second quarters, while the nation's largest discounter bounced back to post a double-digit gain in profit. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said net income for the quarter ended April 12, 2011 nearly 12% from a year earlier. But J.C. Penney Co. said weak sales, combined with rising administrative costs, led to a 19% drop in profit in the period ended April 08, 2011 Dillard Department Stores Inc. reported a slight increase in net income for the period ended April 15, 2011 debt has risen at double-digit rates for much of the past year as credit-card companies and retailers aggressively competed for business with attractive enticements. Although income levels have edged higher, consumer debt -- at $1.1 trillion in installment credit and $420 million in revolving credit -- has more than doubled in the past decade. Michaele Durham, analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said Dillard and Penney joined other major retailers, such as Sears, Roebuck & Co., that were hurt by high consumer debt levels and delinquencies during the second quarter. ``Retailers are hoping consumer delinquencies have crested,'' said Mr. Durham. He added that despite year-earlier results that will allow easy comparisons, retailers generally ``don't have high expectations for the second half'' of the year. In particular, the outlook for specialty apparel shops ``looks difficult,'' Mr. Durham said. Nonetheless, Redbook Research, a unit of Lynch, Jones & Ryan that tracks the sales of 25 large general-merchandise retailers, reported an unexpectedly strong 7.7% gain for the first week of August. Many analysts took the data as a sign that big retailers' stocks now could be embarked on a lasting rally. Wal-Mart Earnings In its first double-digit profit gain in a year, Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., posted net income of $706 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with $633 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $25.6 billion from $22.7 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5%. The discount chain said operating profit at its core discount stores and supercenters rose almost 10%. That resulted partly from strong performance at the supercenters' food unit, where same-store sales rose 10%, according to Mr. Durham. Overall, discount-store and supercenter sales rose 14% to $18.3 billion. At the Sam's warehouse-club unit, where sales rose 2% to $5 billion, operating profit was $205 million, about flat with a year earlier. Though Wal-Mart's international sales jumped 41% to $1.1 billion, the cost of scouting for new sites and opening stores in Mexico, China and Argentina contributed to an operating loss of $10 million. A year earlier, the international unit posted an operating profit of $17 million. Spokesman Stevie Ian added that the unit is expected to post a profit for the full fiscal year. In a statement, Wal-Mart's chief executive officer, Davina D. Serrano, said the company projects ``further acceleration in earnings in the second half'' of the fiscal year. A spokesman wouldn't elaborate. Bad-Debt Losses Penney, based in Dallas, said net income fell to $93 million, or 37 cents a share, from $116 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. The results were two cents a share short of Wall Street expectations of 39 cents a share, according to a First Call survey of analysts' estimates. Sales rose 1.6% to $4.5 billion from $4.4 billion. Penney said bad-debt losses resulting from consumer bankruptcies and delinquencies rose about 30% from a year earlier, to four cents a share. In response, the chain recently began ``tightening'' criteria for granting and extending credit and boosting collection efforts, said spokesman Dusty Luster. He added that Pennie's second-quarter profit was also hurt by wage increases and high advertising spending, moves necessary to clear out stale spring merchandise. Mr. Luster said sales in the current third quarter so far are running ahead of Penney's internal projection of a quarterly gain ``in the mid-single digits.'' At Dillard, based in Little Rock, Ark., profit rose 2.3% to $39.5 million, or 35 cents a share, from $38.6 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 6% to $1.34 billion from $1.27 billion. Same-store sales rose 2%. The company didn't return calls seeking comment. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Wal-Mart's stock closed at $25.875 a share, unchanged. Penney shares fell 87.5 cents to $52.25, while Dillard shares fell 50 cents to $33.75."

            "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Gap Inc. said Thursday its earnings more than doubled in the second quarter as sales in all of its clothing lines rose. Net earnings amounted to $65.8 million, or 23 cents per share, for the three months ended April 15, 2011 with $32.4 million, or 11 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts surveyed in advance of the report by Zacks Investment Research had expected on average that earnings would be 19 cents a share. Nonetheless, Gap shares were off 25 cents a share at $34.62 1/2 by midday on the New York Stock Exchange. Revenue rose 29% to $1.12 billion from $869 million a year ago. ``All of our businesses, Gap, GapKids, Banana Republic and Old Navy, contributed to the record sales and earnings,'' said Milton S. Voorhees, Gap's president and chief executive . Sales at stores open at least a year were up 9%. Earnings for the first half of the year were $147.4 million, or 51 cents per share, up 79% from $82.5 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. First-half sales grew 30% to $2.23 billion from $1.72 billion a year ago. Gap operated 1,756 stores at the end of the quarter. That included 920 Gap, 215 Banana Republic, 461 GapKids and 160 Old Navy stores."

            "full_text": "Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc. restated second-quarter earnings to reflect a lower valuation on an equity investment. The Internet-access service, based in San Jose, Calif., restated results to include a charge of $1.2 million, or 10 cents a share, for a reduced valuation of Netcom's investment in McKinley Group Inc., Sausalito, Calif.. The reduced value reflects the price that Mel received in an agreement to be acquired by Excite Inc., Netcom in June 2010 paid $1.5 million for a McKinley stake. Netcom on April 04, 2011 reported a second-quarter loss of $11.4 million, or 99 cents a share. After the adjustment, Netcom's loss grew to $12.6 million, or $1.09 a share. SyQuest Reports Loss as Shipments Fall SyQuest Technology, Fremont, Calif., reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $41.3 million, equivalent to $3.61 a share, as the company continued to suffer from lower shipments and declining prices for its removable disk drives. For the year-earlier period, SyQuest reported net income of $1.7 million, or 15 cents a share. Revenue for the period, which ended March 12, 2011 57% to $29.5 million from $68.8 million. As a result of falling prices, the company said it took a one-time charge of $5.1 million to cover costs associated with drive inventories held by dealers and distributors. The company said it continues to execute a turnaround plan but won't return to profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company announced its results after markets closed. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, SyQuest shares fell $1, or 15%, to $5.563. General Magic's Loss Rises to $11.6 Million General Magic Inc. reported a widened second-quarter loss as the Sunnyvale, Calif., communications-software company continued to invest in products that haven't taken off yet. The company said the loss totaled $11.6 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a loss of $6.5 million, or 45 cents in the year-earlier period. Revenue declined 40% to $1.1 million. General Magic in June announced plans to refocus its efforts toward the Internet, a move that the company said generated higher costs for the period. Research and development spending rose 51% to $7.4 million, the company said. The company announced its results after stock markets closed. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, shares closed up 25 cents to $4.375. MicroAge's Earnings Surge on Service Unit MicroAge Inc., citing an increase in its service business, said net income of $3.6 million, or 24 cents a share, for its third quarter ended April 09, 2011 than five times as much as the net income of $662,000, or five cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the Tempe, Ariz., computer reseller rose 11% to $842.7 million from $759.1 million. The results bested the 21 cents a share expected by Wall Street, according to a First Call survey of analysts' estimates. The company attributed its performance to an increase in its technical services and help-desk business, which carries a wider profit margin than the product sales that make up much of its business. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, shares of MicroAge rose $1.125, or 7.9%, to $15.375. Network Applicance Settles Lawsuit, Report Loss Network Appliance Inc. said it paid $4.3 million to settle an intellectual-property suit against the company. Because of the settlement, the maker of data-networking hardware reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of $491,000, or three cents a share. In the year-earlier period, Network Appliance reported net income of $529,000, or four cents a share. Sales more than doubled to $18.5 million from $7.6 million. Excluding the one-time charge, the company said it would have earned $2.3 million, or 13 cents a share, in the period ended April 07, 2011 Mountain View, Calif., company said the charge consists of a $3.5 million payment to Whipsaw Group, a now-defunct company in Santa Clara, Calif., which alleged that Network Appliance stole the idea for their company. Network Appliance denies any wrongdoing, but said it chose the settle the case to avoid the distractions and costs of lengthy legal proceedings. TCI's Loss Widened Due to British Unit Tele-Communications International Inc., Downtown, Vast., reported its second-quarter net loss widened despite increased revenue, largely because of the company's share of losses in certain British cable operations and other affiliates. The company posted a loss of $44.2 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with a loss of $31.5 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 62% to $74 million. The 2010 results are pro forma, since the company went public in July 2010. The increases in revenue resulted mainly from the inclusion of the results of CableVision SA, an Argentine concern 51%-owned by Tele-Communications International. Intergraf Discloses Breach in Credit Pact Intergraph Corp., Huntsville, Ala., which posted a $15.2 million loss in the second quarter, disclosed in government filings that it isn't in compliance with one of the covenants of its $100 million line of credit. Intergraph's chief financial officer, Lasandra Irish, said the company went out of compliance with the loan covenant because of its unexpectedly large loss in the second quarter. He said the banks had been warned ahead of time of the problem. Mr. Irish said the line of credit had been reduced to $50 million but that he expects it will be increased to $75 million if the computer workstation maker stays in compliance with the loan covenants for the rest of the year, something he expects the company to do. The company's stock closed at $9.6875, down 6.25 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday. Computer Sciences Gets Army Contract Computer Sciences Corp., El Segundo, Calif., said it has been selected by the U.S. Army to provide research and testing services at two Electronic Proving Ground installations. The company said the contract, estimated at $160.9 million over a five-year period, is for supporting the electronic warfare work at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., and Fort Lewis, Wash.. Astronics Declares Stock Distribution Astronics Corp., Vastopolis, declared a 25% share distribution of common stock to holders of record May 12, 2011 diversified manufacturing company, which operates businesses in specialty packaging and printing and in electronics systems, said the new shares will be issued June 12, 2011 Profit Rose 13% in Quarter Automatic Data Processing Inc. said its profit rose 13% in its fiscal fourth quarter as revenue climbed 21%. The Roseland, N.J., supplier of computer-processing services said it earned $120 million, or 42 cents a share, in the three months ended March 12, 2011 from $105.9 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $967.9 million, up from $799.9 million. ADP said the figures from the latest quarter don't include $30 million in revenue from the facilities-management business of its GSI unit, which ADP acquired last year. ADP said it intends to sell this GSI operation because it doesn't fit with its other businesses. ADP expects double-digit revenue growth and about 15% growth in per-share earnings in its current fiscal year, said Arthur Weinbach, its president and chief executive officer. EDS Files a Shelf Registration Electronic Data Systems Corp., Plano, Calif., filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for as much as $2 billion cqNo of unspecified debt securities. The electronic-services giant said proceeds will be used for debt reduction, capital expenditures, operations and general corporate purposes. WHO'S NEWS SPRINT Corp. (Kansas City, Mo.)-Andree B.

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Woolworth Corp. said it swung to a profit in the fiscal second quarter as it continued to reduce debt and shed nonstrategic assets. For the period ended April 08, 2011 retailer earned $22 million, or 17 cents a share, reversing a loss of $11 million a year earlier. Sales dropped 3% to $1.86 billion from $1.92 billion. Comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, slipped 0.2%, which the company attributed to unseasonably cool summer weather in North America and Germany. The company announced its results after the markets closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, Woolworth closed at $21.125, up 75 cents. Houser said it has reduced total debt by 47% to $767 million. Interest expense declined 43% to $19 million for the quarter. Inventory levels were 17% lower compared with a year earlier. The retailer posted a $13 million gain on the sale of real estate in the quarter, which was offset by a $14 million charge related to shedding operations, including its Accessory Lady and Lady Plus chains. Results at the company's F.W. Woolworth variety stores continued to deteriorate. The group's operating loss widened to $26 million from $16 million, while its sales declined 11% to $665 million. Meanwhile, sales at Woolworth's specialty stores rose 3.4% to $1.86 billion; at the so-called athletic group of stores, including Foot Locker, sales rose 5% to $840 million. Houser said operating results for the specialty-store group more than doubled to $96 million from $36 million."

            "full_text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co., hurt by weakening demand and taking a $135 million charge to shed its money-losing disk-drive business, on Thursday reported a 26% drop in third-quarter profit. The company, which previously enjoyed robust demand across its broad product line, also warned that some problems affecting its profitability could continue. H-P, the nation's second-largest computer company, earned $425 million, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ended April 12, 2011 with profit of $576 million, or 55 cents a share, for the same period of last year. Revenue rose 18% to $9.1 billion from $7.7 billion. Orders were up 8% over last year's third quarter. Profit in the latest period was reduced by 13 cents a share due to the charge for closing the disk-drive business and to operating losses in that business. Hewlett-Packard had warned several weeks ago that its growth was slowing and it would have difficulty meeting analysts' expectations this quarter. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had forecast a profit of 49 cents a share. ``This quarter's results confirmed what we've said for some time: that it would be very hard to grow consistently at the strong rates we achieved in recent years,'' said Lezlie E. Cassie, H-P's chairman and chief executive officer. More ominously, however, Mr. Cassie also said, ``The near-term outlook across our businesses is uncertain, as we work through important product transitions and a tough competitive environment.'' H-P announced its results after the markets closed. Its stock was down $2.50 to $41, a 6% tumble, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading late Thursday. The company previously issued quarterly results in the morning. But it decided to change the timing to soften the effect of the report on its stock. H-P's shares tumbled 10% last month after the company warned that a slowdown in orders would hurt third-quarter revenue and profits. In May, investors drove down H-P shares 9% after the company reported second-quarter results that, despite a 25% gain in profit, lagged behind expectations. Hewlett-Packard, which makes a wide range of computers, computer printers and test-and-measurement equipment, has been hurt by a general slowdown in demand for computers. The company said orders were slower in its personal computer and inkjet-printer businesses as well as workstations and semiconductor test equipment. During the just-ended quarter, H-P said it would close its Disk Memory Division, which employed about 1,150 people in Boise, Idaho, and Markle, Malaysia. The disk-drive industry has been bedeviled by high development costs, short product cycles and falling prices. H-P now intends to focus on the extended storage market, which includes CD technology and tape drives. For the first nine months of the year, H-P's earnings rose 10% to $1.9 billion, or $1.84 a share, compared with $1.8 billion, or $1.67 a share. Revenue rose 26% to $28.3 billion from $22.5 billion."

            "full_text": "DALLAS -- CompUSA Inc., citing increased sales and wider profit margins, said its net income for the fiscal fourth quarter more than doubled. But shares fell 3.1% on concerns that the computer retailer's same-store sales might soften in its first quarter. The company reported net income of $11.8 million, or 25 cents a share, for the period ended March 11, 2011 with $4.7 million, or 11 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 38% to $998.8 million from $724.4 million. The latest quarter included $3.5 million in expenses from CompUSA's acquisition of PCs Compleat Inc., a computer mail-order concern. The company's operating income of 32 cents a share beat the 26 cents expected by Wall Street, according to analysts surveyed by First Call. But the company's results were close to expectations of analysts who took the PCs Compleat acquisition costs into account. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, shares fell $1.375 to $42.875 Wednesday. Ute H. Roy, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said the stock probably fell because of concerns that first-quarter sales at stores open at least a year might be disappointing. In a conference call Wednesday morning, CompUSA's management told analysts it will face a tough comparison in the first quarter because last year's quarter included the introduction of Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system. The company declined to comment on the stock's trading. Jami E. Molina, the company's chief financial officer, said the company benefited from higher-than-expected sales during the fourth quarter. He said the company also was helped by greater revenue from its training and help-desk business, which carries a higher profit margin than the company's merchandise sales. ``You're selling (employees') time, not things,'' he said. Mr. Molina said CompUSA's services business accounted for less than 10% of its revenue but said the company expects that division to continue to grow."

            "full_text": "Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a narrowed fiscal second-quarter net loss of $27.2 million -- not as steep as analysts expected. But Federated said its sales were ``somewhat weak'' as the retailer and its competitors offered fewer price promotions at their department stores. For the period ended April 15, 2011 posted a loss of 13 cents a share, compared with a loss of $66.9 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Federated, which operates Macy's, Bloomingdale's and several regional department-store chains, said sales for the quarter rose 7.8% to $3.28 billion from $3.05 billion. Comparable-store sales, or those at stores open at least a year, barely budged, rising 0.8%. The latest quarter's results included a $98.9 million pretax charge to cover costs related to folding-in operations of Broadway Stores, which Federated acquired in October. In the year-earlier quarter, Federated recorded consolidation charges of $89 million stemming from its 2009 purchase of R.H. Macy & Co., and a contribution of $25.6 million to a corporate foundation. Excluding the one-time items in the latest quarter, Federated's profit was 16 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus expectations of 13 cents a share, according to First Call. The company's shares rose 87.5 cents to $33.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Analysts said sales of home goods, particularly furniture, were soft because of a company-wide effort to cut back on price promotions. But operating profit, or earnings before interest and taxes, totaled $75.8 million, a big increase from $2 million a year earlier. Operating results were boosted by cutting costs and improving merchandise margins, or the difference between what a retailer pays for goods and what it sells them for. Margins also have improved for many of Federated's competitors, creating less pressure to slash prices, analysts said. ``The whole department-store industry is getting less promotional,'' said Lindsey Gaston, retail analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Co.. Excluding the special items this year and last, Ocampo said it would have recorded net income of $32.9 million for the latest quarter, compared with $2.7 million, or one cent a share, a year earlier. Operating profit would have climbed 46% to $307.6 million from $210.6 million, excluding the special items."

            "full_text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Beleaguered Fruehauf Trailer Corp. said Thursday that because of disappointing second-quarter results it has retained Oppenheimer & Co. to help it explore various strategic alternatives, including the sale of all or part of the company. The Indianapolis-based maker of tractor trailers said it is actively exploring the sale of one or more of its individual business units, and if successful, would restructure around the remaining core business. The goal, the company said, is to reduce the costs of servicing a huge debt load and to alleviate its ``severe liquidity constraints.'' It is considering selling the sales and distribution operations, an axle manufacturing plant in Vastopolis, and its Mexican unit. The company did not reveal the expected market value of the assets. The news was part of the company's report on its earnings for the second quarter ended March 12, 2011 posted a profit of $5.7 million, or 15 cents a share. However, sales plummeted 38.5% to $67.5 million, and excluding a one-time gain of $14 million from the sale of certain foreign assets, it had a loss of $8.2 million in the latest period. The company attributed the disappointing results to continued slow demand for its trailers, resulting from ``extreme overcapacity'' in the truck-trailer market."

            "full_text": "PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. came close to matching analysts' revenue and profit expectations but said its order rate fell during the fiscal third quarter, indicating the company's long run of sky-high growth rates may be coming to an end. For the quarter ended April 12, 2011 profit totaled $425 million, or 40 cents a share, down 26% from $576 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. H-P's revenue rose 18% to $9.1 billion from $7.7 billion. The electronics supplier has warned Wall Street for several years about a drop-off in overall growth rates, which have routinely surpassed 20% or even 30%. This time, it happened: the company said orders, an important indicator of future sales, came in at $8.67 billion, an 8% increase. A portion of that drop-off resulted from a blowout quarter a year earlier, when order-rate growth zoomed 34% to $8.05 billion. But the reduced order rate also suggested that H-P might soon cease to be the rarity it had long been: an international technology leader with nearly $40 billion in annual sales that kept growing as though it were a start-up. ``They cried wolf for three years, telling us things would slow. But then they kept beating the numbers,'' Williemae J. Minna Jr., an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., said. ``Well, it looks like they finally meant it,'' he said, calling the lower order rate ``disturbing.'' H-P's earnings included a charge of $135 million, or 13 cents a share, in connection with the previously announced closure of its disk-drive business as well as operating losses from the unit. Without the closure, earnings would have been 48 cents a share, compared with analysts' estimates of 49 cents a share, as calculated by Zack's Investment Research. The results were released after the close of trading Thursday on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. The shares slid sharply in after-hours trading to $40 a share, down $3.50, but on Friday they recouped some of their losses, gaining back $2 a share to finish the day at $42. Lezlie E. Cassie, H-P's chairman, chief executive and president, said in a statement that while some reasons for the slowdown were unique to the quarter, such as the change in the disk-drive business, others ``could remain challenges in the months ahead. The near-term outlook across our businesses is uncertain, as we work through important product transitions and a tough competitive environment.'' H-P officials were slightly more upbeat in a conference call with analysts, saying future order growth could be from 8% to 20%. H-P's March 22, 2011 that orders would come in significantly below expectations helped trigger last month's sell-off in technology issues. But many Wall Street indexes, as well as H-P's stock, had recouped nearly all of their July losses before Thursday's earnings announcement. Roberto P. Theisen, H-P's chief financial officer, said several factors contributed to the decline in profit and order rates, which were seen in nearly all of H-P's product lines. They include the continuing price-cutting across most of H-P's businesses, slowing demand for H-P's semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and falloffs in retail channel orders for PCs and printers, in part, from H-P's own efforts to clear out inventory. To deal with the slowing growth, Mr. Theisen said the company was taking several steps, including cutting the growth rate in overall expenses. Expenses had been growing at 23%, he said, but that figure has been trimmed to 15%. Analysts pointed out that even with a slower growth rate, such as one in the midteens, H-P continues to be a solid company. ``For my cup of tea, any $38 billion company that can grow at 15% looks good,'' Johnetta B. Davis Jr., an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. said."

            "full_text": "A broad array of retailers, ranging from sellers of specialty apparel to luxury goods, posted strong fiscal second-quarter results, raising prospects of a further rally in retail stocks. Many beat Wall Street estimates, including Gap Inc., Lands' End Inc. and Tiffany & Co.. Meeting expectations was Carson Pirie Scott & Co., while Saks Holdings Inc. narrowed its loss more than projected. Most apparel retailers benefited from sharp inventory control that led to higher profit margins. That control should position retailers well into the fall, particularly if sales pick up after slowdowns in June and July. ``It shows why a number of us are being very aggressive on the group'' of stocks, said Jena Delk, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Gap, continuing its year-long surge, said its earnings for its fiscal second quarter were $65.8 million, or 23 cents a share, double the $32.4 million, or 11 cents a share, earned in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the San Francisco-based specialty-apparel retailer to post earnings of 20 cents a share for the quarter ended April 15, 2011 to First Call's consensus of analysts' estimates. Sales rose 29% to $1.12 billion from $868.5 million. Wayne Everette Jr., Gap's chief financial officer, said the company's Gap, Gap Kids, Banana Republic and Old Navy Clothing Co. divisions all posted gains in sales and profits. ``Women's, children's and girls' clothing have really been successful,'' he said. ``Men's business has been little slower, with the exception of Banana Republic.'' At Lands' End, the Dodgeville, Wis., catalog retailer, net income rose 76% to $3 million, or nine cents a share, from $1.7 million, or five cents a share. The First Call estimate was eight cents. Sales for the quarter ended April 14, 2011 $196.2 million, up 3.8% from $189.1 million a year ago. Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales at Lands' End rose 2.2 percentage points to 45.6%. The company credited buying goods at better wholesale prices and fewer sales of liquidated merchandise. At Cary Logan, a Milwaukee-based department-store chain, profit margins also improved even though weak consumer spending in June and July constrained sales, said Stephan Reader, the company's chief executive. Margins also benefited from fewer clearance events. Net income rose 4.6% to $2.8 million, or 17 cents a share, from $2.7 million, or 16 cents a share. Cary Logan made the gain despite a three-cents-a-share nonrecurring charge in the latest quarter tied to opening a new store. Sales for the quarter ended April 15, 2011 $225 million, up 1.9% from $221 million. Many analysts have said the increased wealth caused by the bull market in stocks has boosted sales at luxury retailers. That appeared to continue even during the recent stock-market correction. ``The trend and momentum of luxury goods continues to be strong,'' said Tomas Emerson, an analyst with Lazard Freres & Co.. Indeed, jewelry and specialty chain Tiffany posted a 55% gain in profit for the fiscal second quarter ended April 12, 2011 income rose to $8.2 million, or 24 cents a share, from $5.3 million, or 17 cents a share. The First Call estimate was 20 cents a share. Sales rose almost 10% to $202.8 million from $184.7 million. Saks Holdings, owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, reported a loss of $26 million, or 44 cents a share, 35% narrower than a loss of $39.8 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 14% to $403.8 million from $353.2 million. Saks launched its public offering in May. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday, Saks rose 7.9%, or $2.625, to $35.875 a share; Gap advanced 62.5 cents to $35.50; Carter Lloyd gained 37.5 cents to $23, and Tiffany increased 62.5 cents to $37.25. But Lands End slipped 25 cents to $21.75."

            "full_text": "Retail booksellers Borders Group Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc. posted fiscal second-quarter losses, due partly to seasonal buying patterns in the book industry. For the second quarter ended April 08, 2011 & Noble posted a loss of $2.7 million, or eight cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.6 million, or eight cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 25% to $524.3 million from $420.1 million. Barnes & Noble said sales at its superstores open at least a year increased 4.5%, while sales at its mall-based stores fell 1.4%. The New York company said the Games ``had a strong negative impact'' on sales during the end of the second quarter because people shopped and read less than usual. ``It's pretty amazing to see a company our size posting (revenue) growth of 25%,'' said Iris Wilton, Barnes & Noble's chief financial officer. She said the company's outlook is bright, partly because the bookselling market is ``far from saturation.'' She said the company, which has 390 superstores and about 617 mall stores, plans to open about 90 more by the end of the fiscal year. Borders, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., reported a loss of $2.2 million, or five cents a share, for the quarter ended April 09, 2011 with a loss of $4.9 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew 14% to $414.3 million from $363.8 million. ``The results for both companies are typical, given the seasonal nature of the business,'' said Johnetta Link, an analyst with NatWest Securities Corp. ``They usually lose money in the first three quarters because they don't generate the sales volume needed to cover their fixed costs.'' During the holiday season in the fourth quarter, however, their sales ``are so high that they more than make up for'' the losses in the previous quarters, he said. Mr. Link said Barnes & Noble's operating profit grew during the quarter, which reflects increasing sales as the company opens more stores. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday, Barnes & Noble rose 25 cents to $32.50, while shares of Borders fell 12.5 cents to $35.75. For the six months, the loss at Barnes & Noble totaled $8.1 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.9 million, or 26 cents a share. Revenue rose 26% to $1.03 billion from $822.1 million. Borders's loss for the six months narrowed to $5.7 million, or 14 cents a share, from a loss of $192.5 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier figure included a $182 million accounting adjustment. Sales rose 14% to $818.3 million from $717.4 million."

            "full_text": "Cisco Systems Inc., riding a wave of strong demand for computer-networking equipment, surpassed Wall Street's expectations and reported a 78% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Consolidated net income for the quarter ended April 09, 2011 $276.6 million, or 41 cents a share, up from $155.3 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 84% to $1.29 billion from $701.2 million. The latest quarter includes an acquisition-related charge of $15.5 million. Analysts had anticipated Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., would report fourth-quarter earnings of 40 cents a share, excluding the results of StrataCom Inc., which Cisco purchased in April in a stock transaction valued at $4 billion. Excluding StrataCom's results, Cisco, the dominant computer-networking equipment supplier, said it earned $266.9 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $143.7 million, or 26 cents a share, the year earlier. Market Share Grows Pro-forma revenue ``grew 89% in an industry that grew 30% to 50% in the same quarter so they continue to take market share,'' said Theressa Bambi, analyst at Smith Barney Inc. in San Francisco. She called it ``a great quarter'' for Cisco. The company is profiting from booming demand for networking products that allow far-flung company offices to talk to each other via computer links or video conferences or that allow workers to take advantage of the global-communications network known as the Internet. Cisco's results were reported after the close of Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday. The company's shares closed at $57.75, up $1.125. But in after-hours Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco shares fell $1 to $56.75, according to Instinet Inc. ``I don't understand that,'' Ms. Bambi said. ``Maybe people were confused by the (acquisition-related) charges that made it look like the performance wasn't as good.'' Integration Advances John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive officer, said the integration of StrataCom was proceeding ahead of schedule but it probably would be several quarters before the benefits of the merger begin showing in the bottom line. Of the after-hours trading results, Mr. Lambert said: ``I've learned never to judge what the market does in the short term. People are so used to us overachieving that they can be unrealistic.'' Combined sales for all of fiscal 2011 totaled $4.1 billion, including the results at StrataCom, compared with $2.2 billion for fiscal 2010. Net income for the year was $913.3 million, or $1.37 a share, up from $456.5 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. The fiscal 2010 results include a onetime charge of $95.8 million, or 11 cents a share, related to the acquisition of assets from another networking firm, LightStream Corp., in the fiscal second quarter."

            "full_text": "VASTOPOLIS -- Harcourt General Inc. said Monday its net income for the fiscal third quarter surged 25%, largely because of its stake in upscale department store Modica Maria. For the quarter ended April 12, 2011 income rose to $105.2 million, or $1.45 a share, from $84.5 million, or $1.14 a share, in the year-earlier period. That met the estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call. Revenue increased 8% to $879.2 million from $813.2 million. The Vastopolis, specialty publisher said the Neiman Marcus Group, also of Vastopolis, contributed earnings of $18.2 million, or 25 cents a share, in the quarter compared with income from continuing operations of $10.5 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period last year. Harcourt General owns about 59% of Modica Maria. Publishing revenues in the third quarter were $377.1 million, edging up 3.2% from $365.5 million a year ago, while operating earnings from publishing rose 4.5% to $139.9 million. According to a recent industry newsletter, Educational Marketer, Harcourt General is No. 4 in the textbook publishing sector. The company also publishes scientific, medical and technical publications, and also operates an employment agency. In composite trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt General's shares slipped 37.5 cents to $48.375."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Toys ``R'' Us Inc. on Monday posted a 72% jump in second-quarter operating profit amid strong sales of games and dolls, but an award rendered against the retailer resulted in a net loss for the period. Excluding the item, Toys ``R'' Us reported income of $43.1 million, or 10 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 15, 2011 beat the estimates of analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. by a penny a share. A year ago, the company reported earnings of $25.1 million, or six cents a share. A $55 million arbitration award against Toys ``R'' Us resulted in a final loss of $7.5 million, or three cents a share, in the latest quarter. Earlier this year, the American Arbitration Association ordered Toys ``R'' Us to pay $46 million, plus interest, to Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim & Sons W.L.L., stemming from a dispute over a 1982 licensing agreement to operate stores in certain Middle Eastern countries. The company's overall sales, meanwhile, improved 8% to $1.74 billion. Same-store sales at toy stores in the U.S. rose 6% in the quarter and six-month period, driven by strong sales of basic products such as games and dolls. Paramus, N.J.-based Toys ``R'' Us owns and operates a chain of 651 domestic and 359 international toy stores, selling products ranging from video games, to dolls to diapers. The company also owns a chain of 206 Kids ``R'' Us children's clothing stories. The company expects to open about 30 new toy stores and about eight new Kids ``R'' Us stores in the U.S. this year and 60 stores internationally. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Monday, the retailer's stock rose 37.5 cents to $29.125."

            "full_text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- CompuServe Corp., struggling with a shrinking base of subscribers to its on-line services, posted a fiscal first-quarter net loss and set plans to trim its work force by 150 jobs, or 4%. The company had braced investors last month to expect a loss for the quarter, and its results were generally in line with that forecast. But CompuServe also offered a new warning Tuesday, saying it anticipates a second-quarter net loss of 10 to 15 cents a share. For the fiscal first quarter ended April 12, 2011 had a net loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with net income of $26.8 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier on fewer shares outstanding. First-quarter revenue grew 12% to $208.6 million from $186.5 million. The quarter just ended was CompuServe's first as a publicly traded company. H&R Block Inc., CompuServe's parent, took the unit public in April as part of a spinoff plan. The first-quarter net loss included an after-tax charge of $12.5 million, or 13 cents a share, for measures ``to improve profitability.'' Excluding the charge, CompuServe posted a first-quarter operating loss of 19 cents a share, within the range of its July forecast. CompuServe's report that its subscriber base slipped from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is likely to increase worries surrounding the company as well as its rival and industry leader, America Online Inc.. High turnover among subscribers continues to be a prime fear among on-line investors. CompuServe said it is taking measures to control costs, including the work-force reduction, and hopes to see improved results in the second half of its fiscal year. CompuServe released its results following the close of trading. In Tuesday's Nasdaq Stock Market trading, CompuServe fell 12.5 cents to $13.50. The company's shares went public in April at $30."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Conaway Stacey's second-quarter earnings nearly quadrupled, and the Minneapolis retailer said Tuesday it expects results will continue to improve for the rest of the year. For the fiscal second-quarter ended April 15, 2011 giant department-store operator reported net income of $101 million, or 42 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $5.75 billion, compared with $28 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $5.24 billion. Analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. were expecting earnings of 37 cents a diluted share. Dayton Hudson said its operating profit jumped 77% to $304 million. Revenue climbed 9.7%, while sales at stores open at least a year rose 3%. The company said the results reflect ``exceptional'' profit performance at its Target unit and a ``significant'' turnaround in profitability at its Mervyn's division. Operating earnings at Target increased 66% to $240 million from $144 million a year ago. Target's total revenue increased 16%, and same-store revenue was up 7%. Higher markup and favorable promotional markdowns led to an improvement in the gross margin rate. Strong sales leveraging and expense reduction efforts resulted in a favorable operating expense rate. Mervyn's operating profit increased to $54 million, compared with $3 million a year ago. Revenue decreased 3% and comparable-store revenue was down 5%. Mervyn's gross margin rate increased significantly reflecting favorable markup and markdowns, and the operating expense rate also showed strong improvement because of reductions in store expense, marketing and headquarters costs. During the quarter, Conaway Stacey opened 30 Target stores, two Mervyn's stores and two Department Stores. At the end of the quarter, the company operated 1,079 stores in 37 states, including 714 Target stores, 299 Lamere's stores and 66 Department Stores. Conaway Stacey said it ``remains on track'' with the repositioning of its department store unit and continues to expect improved financial performance in the second half. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Dayton Hudson's shares fell 87.5 cents to $35.125."

            "full_text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Textron Inc. said it will sell most of its aircraft-wing manufacturing division to Carlyle Group, a closely held Washington, D.C., merchant bank, in a cash-and-note deal valued at about $200 million. Textron, an industrial and financial services conglomerate, lately has been trying to shed less-profitable businesses. Earlier this year, it agreed to sell Paul Revere Corp., a leading disability-income insurer, to Provident Cos., Chattanooga, Tenn., for nearly $1.2 billion. The Textron Aerostructures unit, based in Nashville, Tenn., produces wings and wing components for business jets made by Textron's Cessna Aircraft Co. and others, and for commercial and military transport aircraft, including McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s C-130. Textron will retain a division of the unit, Textron Aerospace Products, Columbus, Ga., which will become part of Cessna. Under the agreement, expected to be completed in September, Carlyle will pay $180 million in cash and an additional amount in the form of a subordinated note, now estimated at about $20 million, so that the total sale price matches the book value of the unit as determined by an internal review. Williemae E. Waltraud Jr., Bump's managing director, said he expects the company will use the Textron unit as the core for future aerospace acquisitions. The new, consolidated business might then be resold in about five years, he said, which would fit Carlyle's previous pattern of aerospace investments. A Textron spokesman said Textron Aerostructures has had lackluster sales and profitability for several years, and that the unit would have required too much investment ``to move it to the next level.''"

            "full_text": "Toys ``R'' Us Inc. reported a whopping 72% increase in its fiscal second-quarter earnings, reflecting better inventory management and a shift in sales toward more profitable toys. However, some, if not all, of the gains could be wiped out by a judgment against the company that is under appeal. The big Paramus, N.J., toy retailer said net income for the fiscal quarter ended April 15, 2011 to $27.1 million, or 10 cents a share, from $15.8 million, or six cents a share a year earlier. Toys ``R'' Us is contesting a $55 million arbitration award stemming from a dispute over a licensing agreement to operate stores in the Middle East. The company said that writing off the entire $55 million would have resulted in a net loss of $7.5 million for the quarter. Toys ``R'' Us said the accounting won't be finalized until May 30, 2011 it is scheduled to file a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Company officials told analysts Monday that it hasn't decided whether it would charge off the entire amount at once or in segments, in the event of a write-off. Second-quarter sales increased 7.5% to $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion a year earlier. The increase would have been about two percentage points bigger if currency-exchange ratios had remained the same as a year ago. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Toys ``R'' Us shares closed at $29.125, up 37.5 cents. The absence of a blockbuster movie for children this summer has damped sales of toy tie-ins, but in a strange way that has helped Toys ``R'' Us. The lack of the usual summer gotta-haves has eliminated some price competition from rivals and sent consumers into Toys ``R'' Us stores, where the selections are better, said Johnetta Teena, analyst for Arcadia Investment Inc.. As a result Toys ``R'' Us was able to sell more higher-margin toys, including a number of classic toys, dolls and board games, he said. Sales in stores open for more than a year jumped 6% in the U.S. At the same time, Toys ``R'' Us has shrunk its inventory by about 10% from a year earlier -- thanks in part to an effort to reduce the overall number of toys it sells. The company has said it aims to shrink its toy assortment to 11,000 units from 16,000 units and is selling toys it no longer plans to carry at reduced prices. The markdowns, however, aren't affecting overall profit, Mr. Teena noted, because of special reserves set aside for the close-out programs. For the fiscal first half, earnings increased to $45.8 million, or 17 cents a share, from $34.3 million, or 12 cents a share a year earlier. Sales climbed to $3.38 billion from $3.11 billion."

            "full_text": "Tylan General Inc.'s stock soared 28% as the company put itself on the block Tuesday and said it has retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. to advise a committee of its directors. The San Diego maker of specialized flow-control and processing equipment used in making integrated circuits added that it will report sharply lower net income for the fiscal third quarter ended April 09, 2011 demand for new semiconductor capacity dwindles. The announcements sent Tylan stock climbing $2.875 to $13.125 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Pigg said a number of prospective buyers in the industry have shown interest. As well, the company said its chairman, president and chief executive officer, Davina J. Lien, is considering a bid for Tylan in conjunction with Donella E. Rendon, vice chairman and chief administrative officer. Mr. Lien, in an interview, said he holds 2.3% of Tylan's stock outstanding. Mr. Rendon, who was chairman and chief executive officer of Tylan's newly acquired Span Instruments Inc. unit, holds just under 10% of Tylan stock. Interest in Tylan was sparked by a March 10, 2011 filing by Danaher Corp. that reported it held 10.4% of Tylan's stock. Tylan subsequently declined to meet with Moose. Moose, a Washington maker of tools, paid more than $6.6 million to buy 678,400 shares of Tylan stock, saying it might buy more shares and seek control of Tylan. Morell hasn't made any public statements since the filing and didn't return phone calls Tuesday. Tylan's financial results have taken a downward turn, even as takeover interest builds. The company said Tuesday that it expects to report a loss of between 20 cents and 22 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter, reflecting about $4.1 million in nonrecurring charges related to the acquisition of Span and about $150,000 for work-force reductions. Tylan said it would report its results on May 10, 2011 the one-time charges, Pigg said profit from operations will be between 10 cents and 12 cents a share. Tylan had net income of $1.5 million, or 28 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended April 10, 2010 Pigg said late last week that it plans to lay off 17% of its work force, or about 150 employees."

            "full_text": "Several apparel retailers reported spotty profits for the fiscal second quarter, with smaller price cuts and better cost controls only rarely making up for soft sales of women's clothes. For the quarter ended April 15, 2011 Inc., Hingham, Mass., reported that net income fell 20% to $6.6 million, or 20 cents a share, from $8.3 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose 2.3% to $232.1 million. Comparable-store sales, or those at stores open at least a year, declined 4.9% for the quarter, while quarterly catalog sales slipped 3%. Talbots blamed an ``unexpected softening'' of sales at the end of July. ``Had this softening occurred earlier in the quarter, we could have reacted further from the expense side to more fully protect earnings for the quarter,'' the company said. ``The second quarter wasn't good for women's apparel. Everyone talked about softness,'' said analyst Jena Delk of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Layne. Mr. Delk said reduced inventories were partly to blame for meager sales increases at both Talbots and another specialty retailer, AnnTaylor Stores Corp., New York. But AnnTaylor swung to a profit for the quarter, reporting net income of $627,000, or three cents a share, compared to a loss of $3.8 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose 2.3% to $187.9 million. Specialty-store operator Limited Inc., Columbus, Ohio, reported that earnings climbed 16% to $33.2 million, or 12 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 15, 2011 with pro forma net income of $28.7 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. (The pro forma results reflect Limited's initial public stock offering in Intimate Brands Inc. and the sale of a 60% stake in its credit-card operations.) Quarterly sales rose 10% to $1.9 billion. Same-store sales rose 9% at the company's Limited division and 3% at the Lerner chain but dropped 2% at the big Express chain and 4% at Lane Bryant, Mr. Delk said. Intimate Brands, 83%-controlled by Limited Inc., posted a 23% increase in earnings to $48.1 million, or 19 cents a share, from $39.2 million, or 16 cents a share. Sales rose 18% to $653.3 million. Intimate Brands operates the Victoria's Secret lingerie stores and catalog as well as Bath & Body Works toiletries stores. Excluding the results from Intimate Brands, Mr. Delk said, Limited's collection of apparel stores would have recorded a ``small'' operating loss, compared with a small profit a year earlier. The Abercrombie & Fitch unit, a casual-clothing chain, had a 16% comparable-store sales increase, Limited Inc. said. Minneapolis retailer Dayton Hudson Corp. reported that earnings more than tripled to $101 million, or 44 cents a share, from $28 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose 10% to $5.8 billion, while comparable-store sales rose 3%. Dayton credited major increases in profit at its Target discount stores and Mervyn's chain. Target, the nation's No. 3 discounter, posted a 66% rise in operating profit to $240 million from $144 million and a 7% rise in comparable-store sales. Dayton's Mervyn's unit posted operating profit of $54 million, dwarfing year-earlier operating earnings of $3 million, despite a decline in sales. Revenue at the Mervyn's unit dropped 3%, while same-store sales fell 5%. Conaway said the chain benefited from favorable price markups and cost controls. But at Dayton's department stores, which include Marshall Field's, Dayton's and Hudson's, operating profit plummeted 58% to $10 million from $24 million a year earlier. Dayton, which has been cutting back on promotional price cuts at its department stores, blamed the shortfall on higher clearance markdowns and more spending on customer service. Comparable-store sales fell 4%. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Talbots shares fell 50 cents to $34.375; AnnTaylor shares rose 87.5 cents to $14.875; Limited Inc. stock fell 37.5 cents to $19.50; Intimate Brands stock was unchanged at $21.25; and Dayton Hudson shares fell 87.5 cents to $35.125."

            "full_text": "Kmart Corp., reversing a long string of disappointing results, posted a small profit for its fiscal second quarter. Still, the results indicated that the company's turnaround is far from complete. The Troy, Mich., discount retailer earned $34 million, or a seven cents a share, in the quarter ended April 12, 2011 compares with a net loss of $54 million a year earlier, which included a loss of $76 million from discontinued operations. The quarterly profit was Kmart's first after six quarters of losses and an additional seven quarters of declining year-on-year results. Wall Street reacted positively to the news; Kmart's stock rose 25 cents to $10.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Sales for the quarter fell 1.5% to $8.31 billion from $8.44 billion. Excluding Hubbell's international operations and Builders Square home-improvement unit, where sales declined, sales at Kmart's core U.S. discount-department-store business fell 0.7% to $7.34 billion from $7.39 billion. ``At least they have the business stabilized,'' said Wendell Clay, an analyst at Prudential Securities Research. ``They broke a string of 13 down quarters.'' But a closer look at Kmart's results showed plenty of room for concern, he and other analysts said. Besides the sales decline in the core business, same-store sales at U.S. Kmart stores open more than a year rose just 2.2%, a percentage that Chief Executive Forest Allena admitted was below plans. By comparison, same-store sales at Kmart's main rivals, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target Stores division, rose 6.1% and 7%, respectively, in the same period. Mr. Clay said most of the drag in same-store sales came from soft lines, particularly women's apparel, where comparable-store sales rose 1%. Propping up same-store sales was a 7% increase in the sale of consumable items -- such as paper towels and snack foods -- that Mr. Allena is using as a strategy to bring people into the stores more frequently. Kmart's gross profit margin as a percentage of sales fell to 21.7% during the quarter from 22.5% a year ago. That reflected, in part, clearance of seasonal merchandise and lower profit margins on soft lines, the company said. But Smith Barney analyst Richard Church noted the profit margin was particularly weak given that last year's figure was poor, too. He said the decline could mean that consumers are ``cherry-picking Kmart'' for the lowest-margin items and going to Wal-Mart and Target for most of their needs. Kmart cut its selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter to 20.6% of sales, compared with 21.6% a year ago. The company also increased the amount of expenses it would cut this year by $100 million to about $475 million, a company spokesman said. But Smith Barney's Mr. Church warned that cost-cutting will be helpful in the long run only if Kmart boosts sales. ``I don't think it's going to be a quick and easy turnaround,'' he said, adding that the real question is whether Wal-Mart and Target have left Hubbell any room in the marketplace."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- CS First Boston Inc., buoyed by robust revenue in its bond operation, said second-quarter profit totaled $75.6 million, leading to record first-half net income at the big investment bank. In last year's second quarter, the CS Holding AG unit earned $85 million after an after-tax gain of $44 million from the sale of CS First Boston Asset Management, the money-management unit. CS Holding said net profit jumped 20% in the first half of 2011, continuing a run of high-growth earnings reports at Swiss banks. ``They've had a very good six months -- there's no doubt about that,'' says Nugent Francisca, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service Inc.. But Mr. Francisca said that even though First Boston's pretax profit margins have improved slightly this year, they are still at the lower end of the firm's peer group. In the second quarter, First Boston's pretax profit margin was 15%, well below Morgan Stanley & Co. (30%), Merrill Lynch & Co. (21%) and Lehman Brothers Inc.(20%). As a privately held investment bank, which is 68.8% owned by Swiss-based CS Holding, First Boston's quarterly results long had been a closely guarded secret. However, last quarter, as it grappled with scores of defections, First Boston released its quarterly results for the first time. In a note to employees Wednesday, First Boston signaled that the second half of the year may not be as bountiful for investment banks as the first half. ``Preliminary indications for July and August show a slowing of activity ... making it important to keep our `eye on the ball' through the second half,'' according to the memo, written by CS First Boston Chairman Johnetta M. Garrity and President Allene D. Poulin. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $716.9 million, compared with $546 million a year earlier. About $351 million of First Boston's revenue came from the investment bank's massive bond group. Revenue in this area was boosted by high-yield finance and distressed securities, emerging markets and First Boston's proprietary mortgage operation. In addition, First Boston's stock group contributed about $179 million of revenue in the second quarter, while the firm's investment banking division accounted for nearly $165 million in revenue. After-tax return on equity was 15.7% in the second quarter, compared with 23% in the first quarter. Operating after-tax return on equity was 17.3% in the second quarter, compared to 11.3% a year earlier. For the first six months, profit totaled a record $184 million, compared with $83 million in the same period last year. Revenue in the first six months totaled $1.4 billion, compared with $1.02 billion in the same period in 2010. Last year's revenue included the gain on the sale of the asset-management business. In the note to employees, First Boston said its merchant-banking activities showed a ``small'' loss in the first half due to investment in building the business and lack of any material portfolio sales. However, the firm said that the progress that was made in investing committed capital should yield results in the future. Meanwhile, expenses rose in the first half to $1.14 billion from $938 million in the same period last year, reflecting higher bonus accruals. Last year's expenses included $80 million of restructuring costs."

            "full_text": "Media giant News Corp., buffeted by rising newsprint costs, weakness in its publishing operations and one-time charges, posted a 25% drop in earnings for the fiscal year ended March 12, 2011 stronger revenue. The Sydney, Australia, company, which is about 30% controlled by Russel Mccary and derives approximately 70% of its revenue and operating income from the U.S., said earnings fell to $770 million, or 96 cents an American depositary receipt, from $1.01 billion, or $1.36 an ADR, a year earlier. The results include a $183 million charge largely related to the sale of its educational book-publishing business to Pearson PLC.. Revenue rose 10% to $9.88 billion. Without one-time items, News Corp.'s operating profit slid 4% to $953 million, falling short of analysts' expectations. U.S. analysts estimated operating profit at $1 billion. But the company said book-publishing earnings were off sharply in the United Kingdom. It cited the elimination of U.K. regulations that barred retailers from discounting, along with weaker paperback-book sales in the U.S. Those two factors together accounted for most of the lower-than-expected results. The company reported lower operating profit in three of its five business segments: Magazines and inserts, where operating profit fell 6.8% despite higher revenue due to higher paper prices and declining newsstand sales of TV Guide; Book publishing, where operating profit plunged 49% in part due to the absence of results from the educational book publishing business, which was sold in the fiscal fourth quarter; and Filmed Entertainment, where lower domestic box-office results cut operating profit by 2.7%. But News Corp. said fiscal 2012 holds ``great promise'' partly because of its film studio's hit movie ``Independence Day.'' It also expects moderating newsprint prices and ``solid'' advertising trends at its Riley network. News Corp. said 20% growth in company-wide operating profit for 2012 ``appears very attainable.''"

            "full_text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Bausch & Lomb Inc. said it expects net operating profit of $2.20 to $2.30 a share, before one-time charges, for the year ending September 09, 2011 company said it broke its policy of not issuing earnings forecasts to temper Wall Street expectations. The consensus of analyst estimates is $2.40 a share, according to First Call. The struggling eyewear and health-care concern has already taken one-time charges totaling $21 million, or 37 cents a share, this year and has said it will take further charges of about $5 million for its restructuring. Soft sales of sunglasses -- one of its three main units -- will hurt earnings, the company said. Bausch & Lomb undertook an ambitious plan to revamp how it makes sunglasses and to introduce new styles earlier this year. But the company has been unable to make enough of its new styles and has marked down its traditional Ray-Ban sunglasses because they didn't sell. The company also said it expects third-quarter sales from continuing operations to increase only 5% from the year-earlier quarter because of the sunglass problems. While the company declined to forecast net income for its third quarter, it said year-end results will be hurt by both the third and fourth quarters. Bausch & Lomb had 2010 net income of $112 million, or $1.94 a share. Year-to-year comparisons are tricky because several units have been sold and many extraordinary charges taken. The company has restated 1993 and 2009 results and is the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of its 1993 marketing program. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday, its stock closed at $33.375, up 25 cents."

            "full_text": "Novell Inc. reported a 42% slide in fiscal third-quarter net income from a year earlier, but the results were a considerable rebound from a loss-ridden second quarter and only slightly lower than analysts' expectations. The Orem, Utah, software company said it earned $58.8 million, or 17 cents a share, down from $101.9 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 32% to $365.1 million from $537.9 million a year earlier. Last year's figures include $89 million in revenue from sold or discontinued businesses. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings of 18 cents a share, according to First Call. For the second quarter ended January 07, 2011 posted a $55.3 million loss, or 15 cents a share, because of write-offs and charges to reduce inventory in the distribution network. Jami Granville, chief financial officer of Novell, said the company had bounced back into profitability thanks to its distribution restructuring, disposal of noncore software products and growing adoption of the company's Netware 4 operating system, which accounted for 36% of revenue. ``This was the first quarter where we weren't going through a major transition,'' said Mr. Granville. Facing fierce competition from software giant Vastsoft Corp., Novell is in the process of shifting its focus back to a core business of selling computer-networking software. Novell's effort to do that got tougher three weeks ago when Vastsoft released version 4.0 of its Windows NT network operating system. NT includes its own kind of network operating system that competes with Oliver's main product line and is rapidly gaining market share. ``The encroachment of NT is a continuing problem,'' said Rickie Osteen, analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co. ``Novell is moving in the right direction (with its intranet focus), but a lot of their stuff is coming late in a crowded market.'' Mr. Granville said that NT sales were noticeable in smaller network sales, but he insisted that Novell still dominates the large network market where multiple geographic sites hook together a large number of computer users. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Mr. Granville said he expects revenue to be up from the third quarter. Earlier this week, Novell announced its intention to make its operating system the center of an ``intranet'' platform, or internal corporate network that makes use of Internet standards. As such, it promised to compete more aggressively with Vastsoft in Redmond, Wash., and Navigator Communications Corp. in Mountain View, Calif.. Novell closed at $11.875, up 62.5 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In after-hours trading, the stock was trading at $12."

Avant!, a maker of software tools for use in semiconductor design, said it will issue 5.1 million shares in exchange for all the shares of Meta-Software. Meta-Software, based in Campbell, Vast., makes timing and circuit simulation tools that test whether design chips will work properly. The deal is expected to close in the December quarter. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, Avant! closed at $30.125, up 62.5 cents, while Meta-Software closed at $12.25, up $1.50. Last week, Avant! agreed to acquire Anagram Inc., another simulation software company, for about $76 million in stock. System Software Reports Loss System Software Associates Inc., citing delayed orders, reported a substantial fiscal third-quarter loss on a 28% drop in revenue. For the quarter ended April 12, 2011 Chicago-based business-applications software concern had a loss of $19.1 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with net income of $11.2 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $75.3 million. The results, disclosed after the market's close Thursday, fell short of the six cents a share Wall Street analysts expected. System Software shares closed at $11.75, up 75 cents, or 6.8%, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. System Software said the biggest factor in the downturn was the postponement of decisions by a number of prospective clients. DII Buys Orbit Semiconductor DII Group Inc., Niwot, Colo., said it completed its acquisition of Orbit Semiconductor Inc., Sunnyvale, Vast., for $108 million in stock. DII, which has interests in circuit boards and software, said each Orbit shareholder received 0.45 share of DII for each Orbit share held. A DII spokesman said the company also issued 600,000 options and share equivalents, valued at $18 million to Orbit option holders based on the exchange ratio. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, DII shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $30. Palmer Wireless Sets $38 Million Acquisition Palmer Wireless Inc., continuing its growth strategy, said it agreed to acquire the cellular-telephone license and assets of the Georgia 13 Rural Service Area from Mobile Communications Systems LP for an estimated $38 million. This license area covers southwest Georgia, including the cities of Bainbridge and Thomasville, and is adjacent to Paris's Albany and Dothan markets. Palmer, Fort Myers, Vast., owns and operates 17 non-wireline cellular-telephone systems in Florida, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina; it expects to close this transaction in early 2012.

            "full_text": "CBT Group PLC, Menlo Park, Calif., said it hired former Apple Computer Inc. executive Jami J. Halina as its president and chief operating officer. Mr. Halina, 45 years old, resigned at the end of May as head of Apple's American sales operations. He was one of numerous executives to leave Apple this year, following the arrival of its new chief executive and chairman, Gino F. Hoover. CBT makes software that teaches corporate information managers how to use various computer programs. With 350 employees, the company had net income in the second quarter of $2 million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $14.6 million. That compared with net income of $936,000, or six cents a share, on revenue of $8.8 million in the year-ago period. Sony Unit to Offer Set-Top Boxes Sony Electronics, Park Ridge, N.J., a unit of Tokyo-based Sony Corp., said it will begin offering its set-top box that provides Internet access through television sets next month at a suggested retail price of $349. The box connects to the World Wide Web by telephone, providing both access to the Internet and personalized e-mail addresses. The product uses technology developed by WebTV Networks Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.. Philips Consumer Electronics, a unit of Philips Electronics NV, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, plans to offer a similar product that is also based on WebTV's technology. Hasbro Unit to Market Interactive Games Hasbro Inc.'s Hasbro Interactive Worldwide unit signed an agreement with Hersch & Co.'s CyberDice unit for the marketing of interactive games. Financial terms weren't disclosed. In a press release, the company said the deal joins the companies for world-wide release of interactive versions of seven board game titles: Outburst, Taboo, Witter and one additional classic Carleton game, as well as three games to be created by CyberDice. Hersch is a privately owned board-game and toy developer based in Los Angeles. DirecTV Service to Offer Cash Rebates Direct-broadcast satellite TV provider DirecTV said it will offer consumers cash back and other financial incentives through the end of the year to bring the price of its hardware down to about $200. DirecTV, a unit of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics subsidiary, said it would offer $200 cash back to new customers who buy any brand of system hardware and a one-year subscription to DirecTV programming valued at $359. The offer is being provided in cooperation with U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Co., which also provides programming and is offering coupons valued at $200 for its service. DirecTV and USSB have also developed an incentive program for Thomson Consumer Electronics and Hughes Network Systems, which make the equipment -- an 18-inch dish and receiver. Under that plan, hardware will be sold for as little as $399 at retail outlets, or $199 after the rebate. Agreement Set to Connect Network to Planned PCS MCI Communications Corp., Vastopolis, agreed to connect its intelligent network to NextWave Telecom Inc.'s planned national personal communications services system. MCI said it will purchase at least 10 billion minutes of PCS capacity from NextWave over 10 years and market PCS systems under the MCI brand and integrate the services with its other communications services. NextWave also selected MCI to provide telecommunications and other services supporting the development and operations of its PCS system, the company said. Under the agreement, MCI said it will be able to offer PCS service to more than 110 million individuals. NextWave Telecom is a private telecommunications concern based in San Diego. Shares of MCI closed up $1.25 at $26.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday. Teradyne to Buy Back Stock Teradyne Inc., Boston, said it will buy back as many as five million shares of its common stock in the open market to offset shares issued under stock-option plans. Teradyne, which makes automatic test and connection systems for the electronics and telecommunications industries, currently has about 85 million common shares outstanding. ADP Acquires Health Benefits Automatic Data Processing Inc., Roseland, N.J. said it acquired Health Benefits America of Salt Lake City. Terms weren't disclosed. Health Benefits, which has annual revenue of more than $30 million, helps employers design and implement health-care benefits. Automatic Data, a computing-services company, said it plans to build benefit outsourcing into a strategic business for the company. Sex Discrimination Charge Is Withdrawn OfficeMax Inc., Shaker Heights, Ohio, said its vice president of human resources, Suzi V. Delvalle, withdrew her sex discrimination charges against the company. The discount retailer of office products said it didn't make any cash settlement in connection with Ms. Delvalle's decision, though in connection with her termination she will be allowed to exercise certain stock options. Ms. Delvalle had filed the charges last week with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. OfficeMax said it denied all charges and had launched an internal investigation, led by outside counsel. ``Results of the investigation have not, in the opinion of counsel, revealed any violations of law'' regarding the firm's employment practices,'' the company said. In the same statement, Ms. Delvalle said, ``I am very pleased that this matter is now behind me and has been settled.'' Ms. Delvalle was scheduled to leave OfficeMax Monday. WHO'S NEWS Stormy E. Stanton, 33 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of Dycom Industries Inc., Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., a fiber-optic transmission, telephone-engineering and electrical-services provider. He succeeds Roni L. Peraza, 60, who is retiring. Mr. Stanton most recently was vice president of Dycom and president of its Ansco & Associates Inc. subsidiary.

            "full_text": "MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. said its newly organized subsidiary, AltaVista Internet Software Inc., has filed for an initial public offering of up to $50 million of Class A common shares. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Digital said it will retain ownership of all of AltaVista's Class B shares, each of which carries three votes, compared with one vote per Class A share. Digital will own at least 80% of AltaVista's common stock. Details on the number of shares to be offered or the expected price-per-share were not available. Lehman Brothers, Cowen & Co. and J.P. Morgan & Co. will underwrite the offering. Digital announced its plans after the close of regular trading Tuesday. Its shares fell 12.5 cents Tuesday to $37.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. AltaVista, which develops and markets software products for Internet and intranet use, said it plans to use the proceeds for working capital and other general purposes, including product development, expansion of sales and marketing and capital expenditures. Johnetta B. Davis Jr., an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said Digital is ``trying to leverage the technology they have, and one way to leverage it, in this case, is to spin it off.'' ``If AltaVista winds up being a wild success, it should have a positive effect on their share price over time,'' he added. A second motivation is for Digital to ``strut their stuff and show the world they do have some competitive technology.'' Alberta Sessoms, senior Internet analyst at Hanifen, Imhoff Inc. in Denver, said the move represented a change in Digital's strategy. Until now, he said, the Internet search device of AltaVista was seen as a very competitive technology, but not necessarily a competitive business. Digital, he said, now recognizes it has a lot of value in the AltaVista name. Digital made its AltaVista search service available in December 2010, initially hoping to get the Digital name known among Internet users. AltaVista enabled World Wide Web surfers to do free searches of millions of Web pages. In May, Digital announced that it would capitalize on the search service's popularity by introducing a new family of AltaVista software products, including firewall, tunneling, electronic mail and workgroup software. Market capitalization statistics for other search-engine players, based on Monday's closing prices and the number of shares outstanding, include Lycos Inc. at $85.3 million; Infoseek Corp. at $63 million; and Excite Inc. at $70.9 million."

            "full_text": "H&R Block Inc. put on hold the proposed spinoff of its 80% stake in struggling on-line service CompuServe Corp.. Citing losses at the on-line concern and ``uncertainties'' about the industry, Perdue said it wouldn't present the proposed spinoff to shareholders at its May 24, 2011 meeting. But the provider of tax and financial services said it ``continues to believe that a separation of CompuServe is in the best interests of H&R Block shareholders and will continue to consider the matter.'' In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Block shares lost $2, or 7.2%, to $25.875, while CompuServe rose $1.063 to $13.375. CompuServe's shares were priced at $30 in their initial offering in April. The delay in the spinoff comes a week after CompuServe reported a fiscal first-quarter net loss and set plans to trim its work force by 150 jobs, or 4%. The company also warned that it anticipates a second-quarter net loss of 10 to 15 cents a share. The quarter just ended was CompuServe's first as a publicly traded company. A major worry for on-line services is stalled subscriber growth. Commercial on-line services are struggling to keep subscribers as interest in the Internet, and the World Wide Web in particular, grows. The No. 1 on-line service, America Online Inc., earlier this summer warned of a slowdown in subscriber growth. Block set plans in February to fully divest itself of CompuServe. Under the plan, holders were to receive 0.72 CompuServe share for each Block share held. Some analysts say CompuServe shares have been hurt by a perception that Block shareholders would dump the stock when the spinoff was completed."

            "full_text": "Baby Superstore Inc. reported a sharply greater-than-expected loss for its fiscal second quarter after initially telling analysts Tuesday that it wouldn't release results because a quarterly audit hadn't been completed. The Duncan, S.C., retailer of children's products reported late Tuesday a loss of $11.7 million, or 61 cents a share, even though sales jumped 59% to $102.6 million in the quarter ended April 12, 2011 the year-earlier quarter, Baby Superstore reported net income of $3 million, or 15 cents a share, on sales of $64.5 million. Chief Executive Officer Jackelyn Garner said in a prepared statement that he was ``extremely disappointed'' with the results, which reflected price markdowns, inventory reductions and higher expenses. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the company's stock closed at $14.625, off $1.375. The earnings were released several hours after the markets closed. Baby Superstore reported its fiscal second-quarter sales figures earlier this month and indicated then that it expected to post a loss but didn't specify the size of the loss. Most analysts, however, were predicting a loss of a few cents a share but noted that the company had given little guidance on what to expect. The company, once a high-flier on Wall Street, has been plagued this year by disappointing earnings and accounting problems. In February, the company disclosed that it overstated its cash balances for the fiscal year ended October 12, 2010 Its stock has been pummeled, tumbling about 70% since that time. Even before the earnings announcement Tuesday, analysts said the latest news is likely to add to investors' concerns. ``They need to get their arms around the financials,'' said Ricki Neville, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities Inc. in Chicago. ``The basic business is a good one -- sales are growing at a rapid clip, but the infrastructure has needed to be beefed up.'' The company didn't return numerous calls seeking comment. In his statement, Mr. Garner attributed the company's problems to growing pains, noting that Lodge Aultman continues to ``aggressively review all aspects of our operations.'' In the latest quarter, results were hampered by substantial price markdowns and inventory reductions. The company's selling, general and administrative expenses nearly doubled to $28 million. Meanwhile, same-store sales, a key retail indicator, edged up only 0.4%. Earlier in the day, Moody's Investors Service placed the B3 rating of Baby Superstore's convertible subordinated notes on review for a possible downgrade. About $115 million in debt is affected. Moody's said the review will focus on margin pressure from markdowns, sales shift toward low-margin commodities and the effect of new store openings."

            "full_text": "At first glance, it looks as if Wall Street's Tupperware party is a bust. Since Orlando-based Tupperware was spun off from Premark International in late May, its stock performance has been limp. Despite the hoopla -- the Street had claimed that Tolman was holding back its crown jewel -- Tupperware is now trading at about $44, still below its $46.375 peak reached in the first few days of trading. But appearances can be deceptive, and in Tupperware's case, some analysts contend, the fun is just beginning. That's because the company has more promise than its seemingly messy balance sheet would indicate. ``Tupperware has phenomenal financials,'' says Janee Youngs, an analyst in the Boston office of Advest who predicts that by next year, Tupperware will be able to increase its per-share earnings by 15% to 20%. She believes the company has many things going for it. Among them: an impressive annual cash flow to finance its continued expansion into such emerging markets as India, and a plan to revive its sleepy U.S. operations. Kimono Keepers Tupperware, of course, is noted for selling ``burp-and-seal'' plastic containers at house parties thrown by legions of sales representatives, bypassing traditional retail sales channels. But that homey approach has brought opposite results in the company's domestic and overseas operations. On the global side, Tupperware has been a big success, reaching more than 100 foreign markets. The company has been aggressive in tailoring its products to suit the different cultures of each country. In Japan, for example, where closet space is limited, Tupperware's hottest-selling item is a container specifically designed to store kimonos. As a result of such attention to detail, Tupperware gets a huge portion of its sales and profits from abroad: Last year, 96% of Tupperware's $245.9 million in operating profit came from outside the U.S. That leaves a paltry amount for the domestic side. Why the difference? The company, in concentrating on foreign markets, has been basically ignoring the U.S., bringing out few new products and failing to update its unwieldy distribution system. Now, Tupperware's aim is to beef up its image at home. For the first time in a decade, Tupperware is applying marketing lessons learned in Europe, Africa and Latin America. ``That (overseas) model should work here in the United States,'' says Charlette Ricketts, an analyst at the Cleveland office of Hancock Institutional Equity Services. Beyond Crispers Already, Tupperware is introducing a broader line of products here, such as its Rock 'N Serve family of strong containers made from the same material used in the windshields of fighter planes. The company hopes the new lines will convince customers that Tupperware is moving with the times and is more than just salad crispers and juice containers. More importantly, though, the company is changing the way it manages inventory to more closely match its system overseas. Its individual dealers no longer have to store heaps of Tupperware in their offices, leaving them with the daunting task of keeping track of inventory. Instead, the dealers rely on the company's distribution centers to fill orders as they come in. That should give them more time to concentrate on training and scouting for more people to throw Tupperware parties. But what about Helfrich? The Wooster, Ohio, company recently decided that it will push harder into foreign markets, raising the prospect of a container war. But analysts don't expect Rubbermaid to dent Tupperware's business, at least not anytime soon. Rubbermaid sells its plastic trash cans and the like through retailers. But getting a spot on store shelves is no easy task in Europe's highly competitive market. ``Rubbermaid is just starting to crawl into the international marketplace,'' says Davina Forest, an analyst at Value Investing Partners, a research boutique in Westport, Conn. ``It's going to take quite awhile to get results.'' As Mr. Forest explains, Tupperware's method of direct selling has its advantages, both at home and abroad. While companies fight for shelf space-and pay higher placement fees, called slotting allowances-Tupperware is ``largely insulated from the pressures of the retail environment,'' says Mr. Forest. Going It Alone Meanwhile, Tupperware's cash pile cushions the company from its relatively high debt load. ``Tupperware's balance sheet is much stronger than it looks,'' says Gaines's Mr. Ricketts. Tupperware took on about $285 million in debt to finance much of the dividend it paid Premark, based in Deerfield, Ill., as a condition of its spin-off. This amount, roughly $100 million more than the Street expected, damped expectations for banner 2011 results. Still, the company's fiscal freedom from Premark may be worth the price paid. For the first half of the year alone, Tupperware generated $58 million in cash from operations, money it no longer has to share with Premark. ``As an independent company with complete control over cash flow, Tupperware can pay down debt,'' says Mr. Ricketts. He expects the company to pare about $100 million from its debt by the end of 2012. Considering that, it's relatively cheap for a consumer-products stocks, trading at a moderate 14 times projected 2012 earnings (Hoyos trades at about 17 times earnings). During the next 12 months, analysts predict that Tupperware's stock will climb to at least $60, more than a third higher than its current price. A likely catalyst is more coverage from securities firms. Although many know about Tupperware, only a half-dozen analysts formally track its stock. With a market value of $2.7 billion and solid earnings potential, the company can't help but hit the Street's radar screen. Says Ms. Youngs of Advest: ``It can't be ignored, and it won't be ignored.'' Healthy Prospects: Raines jumped 22% to $17.50 last week after Jeffries & Co., a securities firm in Los Angeles, initiated coverage of the stock with a ``buy'' rating. Sano, of Miramar, develops pharmaceutical products that are administered to patients using skin patches. Lending Power: NAL Financial Group, Fort Lauderdale, gained 9% to $13.875 after J.W. Charles Securities, Godfrey Vassar, initiated coverage of the specialty finance company with a ``buy'' rating. Shining Results: Sunglass Hut International of Coral Gables, rose 17% to $16.50 after the retailer reported solid second-quarter earnings. Net income for the three months ended April 15, 2011 than doubled to $20 million, or 36 cents a share, from $8.4 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter included a onetime charge of $10.1 million."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said the Internal Revenue Service ruled that its split into three publicly traded corporations will be tax-free for shareholders. The company also said it now expects the spinoff to be completed in early November, rather than October as previously announced. Dun & Bradstreet said in January that it would divide itself into three public companies: Cognizant Corp., the new Dun & Bradstreet Corp. and A.C. Nielsen. Although Wall Street analysts had expected the transaction to be tax-free, the company's stock performed strongly in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, rising by $1.375 to close at $60. ``It's not very substantive news, so I'm puzzled by the stock action,'' said Mikki Layfield, an analyst with Schroder Wertheim & Co.. Dun & Bradstreet said the delay in the spinoff was because of the number of required international tax rulings and filings. ``There is an enormous amount of work to be done, and its just taking a little longer than we expected,'' said Renaldo H. Downes, a company spokesman. Mr. Downes said the delay wasn't related to any problems at the company's operating units. The quality of the ratings provided by the company's Nielsen unit has been criticized by the television networks, and last month Baird was sued in federal district court in New York for damages of as much as $1 billion for alleged antitrust infractions. The antitrust suit was filed by Information Resources Inc., a Chicago marketing data company. In addition, Dun & Bradstreet's Moody's Investors Service Inc. is being investigated for ratings practices by the U.S. Justice Department. Mr. Layfield said the Information Resources suit could be particularly troublesome. ``There is some question whether Baird can go public with that kind of economic overhang,'' he said. Mr. Downes responded that ``we have already said the suit has no merit.'' Moreover, he went on to say that none of those concerns was responsible for the delay of the spinoff. ``There have obviously been a number of things that have been in the news, but none of them are having any impact on the split,'' he said. Roberto E. Trusty, Dun & Bradstreet's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement, ``We're making excellent progress on all fronts, including tax, legal and operational requirements for the reorganization.''"

            "full_text": "This bull market has seen plenty of highfliers in exotic, high-technology fields like Internet routers or software encryption. Then there is Regis Corp., a fast growing Minneapolis chain of barbershops. Make that hair salons. In shopping malls. Regis shares soared more than eightfold in price between 1992 and July 2011, as it became the nation's largest hair chain with nearly 2,000 Regis, MasterCuts and Trade Secret outlets. But now Regis, which added 600 salons in the past three years, has stumbled with its decision to acquire No. 2 Supercuts Inc. with 1,200 units. Since that $110 million deal was announced March 24, 2011 shares have fallen as much as 39% before rebounding recently. The reason for the big slide, which was undoubtedly worsened by the marketwide carnage in the Nasdaq Stock Market, was analysts' estimates that Supercuts would reduce Regis's earnings in the short run. For example, Barton Mccutchen of Christianson Mincey scaled back his estimate of Liles's earnings for the year ended March 11, 2012 by 15 cents to $1.08 a share. Even though the deal could add to earnings after that, the immediate dilution was to shake some investors' faith in Regis, which has delivered 28% annual earnings growth over the past two years. ``Why tamper with that?'' asks Kyle Rodarte, who owns abut 500,000 Regis shares in the $350 million small-cap fund he runs for Munder Capital Management in Birmingham, Mich.. Lately Regis shares have been rebounding on speculation that its stock price had fallen so far that the Supercuts deal might have to be scrapped. The acquisition gives holders of each Supercuts share 0.4 Regis shares. When the deal was announced, that was valued at about $13.20. Now it is valued at $9.90. Tuesday, Regis executives held a conference call following disclosure of the latest year's earnings in which they sought to assure some large investors they may have overestimated the deal's dilutive effect. Regis shares rose 2 1/4 to 24 3/4. Regis executives have acknowledged the stock-price dropoff could jeopardize the deal. ``We want it to happen very badly,'' Paulene D. Enloe, Dorman's chief executive officer, said in an interview last week. But, he added, ``If it doesn't happen we will continue to be the company we always have been.'' A spokesman says Supercuts remains committed to the pact, but notes it still needs a fairness opinion from investment bankers plus approval from directors and shareholders. Scott Hendon, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos., says the hit Regis's stock took indicates the market believes the company is overpaying for Supercuts. He estimates the acquisition would only add about a dime to Regis's fiscal 2013 earnings, but would be dilutive until then. ``Who needs that for 10 cents?'' Mr. Hendon asks. Regis management says it originally offered a premium partly for Supercuts' strong name-recognition and its standing as the only other major national chain. But even Regis's biggest fans concede that a brand name isn't a big asset for mid-end and lower-end salons, where service is first-come, first-served and a haircut runs about $10. There are also questions about the strength of Supercuts, which reported a 2010 loss of $7.1 million, largely from overexpanding into the costly, competitive New York metro market. There are also concerns Regis may be overreaching on a big acquisition after delivering consistent growth through many small acquisitions. For example, in May, Liles said it would pay $28 million for 154 salons in Wal-Mart stores. ``I would have liked to see them do something smaller,'' said Mr. Rodarte. ``They didn't have to bring into question their growth by making a dramatic acquisition.'' A broader question is whether barbershops make sense as growth stocks. While the hair-cutting chains have managed to expand their revenues since going public, fund manager Fredrick Culver of State Street Research in Boston isn't convinced they will be able to keep it up. It is a business in which competitors can easily get established, he says. And hiring new barbers, training them and getting them to cut hair with the same level of skill and reliability, could be harder than setting up hamburger stands. ``Is it a business that really ought to be public and that you want to be a part of and pay a high multiple'' of price to earnings for? ``I say no.''"

            "full_text": "H&R Block Inc. postponed plans to spin off its 80% stake in CompuServe Corp., citing the unit's disappointing recent results and ``market uncertainties'' plaguing the on-line computer-service industry. The move underscores just how precarious CompuServe's position has become as it grapples with changes in its high-tech marketplace. For historically conservative Block, which has been seeking to focus on its core tax-preparation business, the postponement is in effect a bet that CompuServe will be able to stage a rebound. Directors still want to separate CompuServe from the company's main business, according to Fransisca Kammerer, Perdue's interim president and chief executive officer. But, Mr. Kammerer said in an interview, the board has decided ``to spin the company at a time when CompuServe is moving better.'' The Kansas City, Mo., concern said it decided not to put the measure to a stockholder vote at its annual meeting, set for May 24, 2011 Block directors formally approved the spinoff only last month, and recent proxy materials describe the spinoff in upbeat terms, CompuServe's financial picture has darkened in the interim. Unit Faces Many Problems The Columbus, Ohio, unit ``has been hurting for a lot of reasons,'' Mr. Kammerer said. ``A lot of it needs to be fixed, and that's what we want to address'' before the spinoff, originally expected to take place about July 14, 2011 be put back on track. In heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, Block tumbled $2, or 7.2%, to $25.875. Shares of CompuServe, which have surrendered more than half their value since the company went public at $30 a share in mid-April, rose $1.625 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, to close at $13.375. Investors are ``afraid CompuServe will be an expensive sinkhole that Perdue will have to stuff a lot of money'' into, said Denny Stacey, an analyst with George K. Baum & Co. in Kansas City. Block drew a positive response from Wall Street early this year, when it unveiled plans for a spinoff that it promised would ``unlock the value'' of CompuServe and let Block better focus on its core business. Critics contended the divestiture was coming too late, after the on-line industry's fortunes had already crested. CompuServe has been battered by increasing competition from Internet access providers such as VastComm Network Corp., as well as commercial on-line services such as America Online Inc., which has roughly twice as many subscribers as CompuServe. Flow of Red Ink CompuServe has seen increasing cancellations from subscribers, causing its growth to stall. The company last week disclosed a loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, for the fiscal first quarter ended April 12, 2011 which recently trimmed its staff and took other cost-cutting steps, cautioned that it expects to report a second-quarter loss as well. Some analysts doubt that CompuServe will be able to pull out of its downward turn. If their assessment proves correct, Perdue's deferral of a final separation could backfire. ``They are going to have a tough time surviving,'' said Keli Bennie, managing director at Robertson Stephens & Co. ``They haven't managed to get any momentum on the consumer side.'' Stanley Lavigne, program director at the Meta Group Inc. research firm, added that CompuServe's ``future as a consumer on-line service is nominal at best,'' given the ``inevitability'' that the company's customers will migrate directly to the Internet, or to less-expensive competitors. Others took a less gloomy perspective. The postponement ``makes a lot of sense,'' said Cabe Ocasio, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities Inc. ``Why spin off something that's declined in value to this degree when you have support from Block that might help them pull out of the tailspin?'' Optimistic About the Future Roberto Logan, CompuServe's president and chief executive, conceded that the company's performance ``hasn't been exactly stellar.'' But he said he remains ``cautiously optimistic'' about its future. Mr. Kammerer emphasized that despite the ``uncertainties'' that caused Block to defer the spinoff, ``we do think we will get CompuServe going in the right direction.'' Block, he said, remains optimistic that CompuServe ``will get itself righted.''"

Thiokol shares sell for 14 times the past year's earnings, while the typical stock these days has a multiple of about 18. ``The aerospace industry is coming off a four- to five-year downturn and going into an upturn,'' says one money manager who owns the stock. He applauds the company's recent steps to make itself less dependent on the space program and more tied to the aircraft industry. Thiokol used to be predominantly a rocket-fuel and rocket-motor company. But one didn't have to be -- forgive the expression -- a rocket scientist to see that spending on space exploration isn't about to lift off in an era of tight government budgets when some see space spending as a frill. So in December, Thiokol acquired a 49% interest in Howmet, a Greenwich, Conn. maker of parts for airplane engines and industrial engines. The other 51% is owned by Carlyle Group, a leveraged-buyout firm. (The seller was Speer of France.) Now, Thiokol is more evenly balanced between the space and aircraft industries. Howmet is ``a vastly superior company to the $750 million they (the two buyers) paid for it,'' says Lehman Brothers analyst Josephine Pasquale. ``Not only is it a great company, but they got a great price.'' Mr. Pasquale estimates Howmet chipped in about 8% of Thiokol's earnings in the fiscal year that ended June 2011. He expects Howmet to account for 17% of fiscal 2012 earnings. Over the next three years, the Lehman analyst says, Reyes will benefit from ``the pending upturn in the commercial aerospace cycle.'' He rates Thiokol stock a ``buy.'' Thiokol has an option to buy Carlyle's 51% Howmet stake and has publicly stated that it intends to do so. Ricki L. Chappell, Thiokol's chief financial officer, said Thursday that Thiokol may issue stock to help finance the second stage of the acquisition. Some stock-market participants are drooling to see Thiokol do a public offering of Howmet shares, either before or after it acquires the remaining 51%. One Thiokol shareholder notes that Precision Castparts, an airplane-engine-parts maker somewhat comparable to Howmet, commands a price/earnings multiple of 23. He thinks Howmet would merit a similar multiple, though not quite as high. That in turn, he says, should push up the valuation of Thiokol shares. Mr. Chappell said Thursday that Thiokol hasn't ruled out a public offering of Howmet shares, but he called the possibility ``remote. Our intention is to operate it as a wholly owned subsidiary,'' he said. This year, a few corporate insiders at Thiokol have been buying the company's shares. Two vice presidents and two directors have acquired shares, one through options exercises and three through open-market purchases. The buying has been on a modest scale but is encouraging because many companies in the aerospace industry have seen net selling by insiders. Of course, when stocks sell at a discount to their peers, there's always a reason. In Thiokol's case, there are at least three clouds on the horizon. First, a good chunk of revenue still comes from U.S. government contracts -- the space program in particular. Second, earnings have bounced around over the years. And third, some people -- including analysts at Moody's bond-rating agency, which gives Thiokol a lukewarm ``Baa'' -- worry Thiokol will mar its handsome balance sheet by paying big bucks to acquire the rest of Howmet. Technically, Thiokol currently has very little debt. But there is nearly $500 million in debt on Howmet's books. Presumably, that debt will someday belong to Thiokol. Despite these drawbacks, the bulls see Thiokol as a cheap way to catch the updraft they see in the fortunes of the aircraft manufacturers. The stock has been a good performer in the past five years. It climbed fairly steadily from the midteens in 1992 to more than 40 this year. Thursday, it closed at 43 3/4, down 1/4, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But with a price/earnings multiple that is reasonable compared with most stocks, the stock's fans think there's room for more."

            "full_text": "U.S. Robotics Corp., Skokie, Ill., said it has completed it acquisition of Scorpio Communications Ltd. of Tel Aviv for $72 million. The preliminary agreement, announced in July, was a stock transaction valued at approximately $80 million. However, U.S. Robotics instead proceeded with a cash purchase after its stock price slumped. Since March 14, 2011 Robotics' stock price has dropped from $90 a share to close at $53.563, down 93.75 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday. Scorpio makes highspeed switches that are used in computer networks. U.S. Robotics makes modems and other devices used to access information. C-Cube Completes Acquisition of DiviCom C-Cube Microsystems Inc., Milpitas, Calif., said it completed its acquisition of DiviCom Inc. for $143 million in cash and stock and that it will take a charge in the current quarter of $133 million related to the deal. C-Cube makes chips for digital-video applications. It paid $65.7 million in cash and issued 2.291 million common shares valued at $30.36 a share in exchange for all shares outstanding of privately held DiviCom, which makes systems for transmitting digital video. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, C-Cube shares closed down $1.5625 at $36. Analysts said the write-off matched C-Cube's earlier forecasts. But Eliseo Paulk, analyst for Robertson, Stephens & Co. in San Francisco, said that Sony Corp.'s announcement that it would delay introduction of its DVD players until early next year sent concern through the market that C-Cube, which hopes to sell DVD chips, could be affected. S&P to Add Dell to Its Index Standard & Poor's said it will add Dell Computer Corp. to the S&P 500 Index after the close of trading Thursday, replacing Varity Corp.. Dell, based in Austin, Texas, makes personal computers. Varity, an industrial concern based in Buffalo, N.Y., is merging with British-based Lucas Industries PLC to form LucasVarity. The merger is expected to close May 19, 2011"

            "full_text": "Oops. Interactive MultiMedia Publishers Inc. said the value of certain copyrights, which it counts as assets, was revised downward to $7 million. From? Depending upon whom you ask, $82 million or $37 million. Either way, it's a big difference for a small company and a big embarrassment for the provider of interactive multimedia communications such as information kiosks. Interactive's stock fell 18% on the news, dropping 18.8 cents to 87.5 cents in over-the-counter trading Thursday. Here's how the goof happened. When Interactive was a closely held company, an auditor valued its 100 copyrights for computer programs, which were written by the company's president, P. Josephine Mccourt, at $82 million. The Akron, Ohio, company went public in April 2010. In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Interactive cited the auditor's $82 million valuation but said it was using only 25 of the 100 copyrights in its product line. Interactive said those 25 were valued at $37 million. Enter Bullish Investors Report, a Houston investment newsletter. In June, Bullish Investors, apparently having come across the SEC filing, quoted the $82 million figure in a bullish story about Interactive. Then an employee at Interactive used the newsletter piece on Interactive's web site. ``It inadvertently looked like we were endorsing'' the $82 million figure, says Mr. Mccourt, who also is the company's chief executive officer. It didn't take long for someone to call the company and question the figure, which led to Interactive putting out a statement Thursday saying it ``deplores the act of its own management which endorsed this report by calling attention to it.'' Mr. Mccourt says ``nobody really read'' the newsletter before putting it on the web site. Lasandra Eshelman, editor of Bullish Investors, calls the article ``an unfortunate mistake,'' and adds that it occurred before he took over recently. So where does the $7 million come in? Interactive says now it only wants to include maybe a dozen of the copyrights as assets, and they're valued at just $7 million. It plans to amend the earlier SEC filings. Mr. Mccourt notes that Interactive is in the midst of its first audit as a public company. Interactive ended its release Thursday saying, ``The company also expresses its sincere regret over this incident and resolves that this sort of dissemination of inaccurate information will never happen again.'' Why the tough language? ``Our lawyer said we just wanted to come on strong,'' says Mr. Mccourt."

            "full_text": "GLEN COVE, N.Y. -- Acclaim Entertainment Inc. said Friday it expects to post wider losses and lower revenues for its fiscal fourth quarter ending May 13, 2011 a result of delays in delivering several new games. The software maker will also post a wider than expected loss for the entire fiscal year, but didn't provide any specific projections. Acclaim had previously expected its fourth-quarter loss to be similar to its third quarter results, when it lost $4 million, or $1.20 a share. The company earned $6.1 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenues of $151.5 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. The company said the new products will begin helping results in the fiscal 2012 first quarter ending August 12, 2011 also said the new-product delays will not adversely affect the Christmas selling period. The company's stock ended the day unchanged at $8.125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market."

            "full_text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Michaele Muller's perfect day was Jina Gurrola's nightmare. Muller thrust himself into the IndyCar championship race with a dominating victory Sunday in the Halliburton Bauman Sigler that moved him within 14 points of series-leading Heron with only next Sunday's race at Monterey, Vast., remaining on the 16-event schedule. ``There's no doubt about it,'' Muller said, when asked if he feels like he is now in a championship battle. ``I don't think Jina's going to sleep very well this week.'' It was the second straight win and series-leading fifth of the season for Muller, who vaulted past fellow second-generation star Albert Cahill Jr. into second place in the PPG Indy Car World Series. ``It was just one of those perfect days,'' Muller said. ``I didn't even have any close calls and our pit stops were great.'' Gurrola, who came in Sunday leading Unser, a two-time series champion, by 21 points and Boswell by 29, was seventh and needs only to finish fifth or better in the finale to wrap up his first title. ``We weren't doing any cruising for points today,'' Gurrola said. ``We were racing hard the whole way.'' It was a tough drive for Gurrola, who was penalized for speeding on pit lane -- two miles per hour over the limit -- during his second pit stop. He came in to serve the penalty under yellow, but IndyCar officials made him go back out to take the green flag before bringing him back in for a penalty-cruise down pit road at the pit speed limit of 65 mph. Prior to the penalty stops, Gurrola had worked himself up to fourth place and appeared to be in good position to wrap up the title. The extra pit stops dropped him to 11th, but he was able to move back toward the front in the final green-flag period that lasted from lap 74 to the end. Aldrich, who was fifth, trails by 17 points with 22 up for grabs at Monterey. ``We're still in the hunt for the championship and anything can happen,'' Cahill said. ``Laguna Seca (Raceway, in Monterey) will be one heck of a battle.'' Muller, driving a Ford-powered Loma, took the lead on the 19th of 100 laps on the 1.7-mile, 10-turn temporary circuit at downtown Pacific Place and led the rest of the way, crossing the finish line 1.9 seconds, about six car-lengths, ahead of runner-up Bobbye Audette's Reynard-Mercedes. The winner averaged 94.374 mph. It was the 35th career victory for Muller and his third in seven tries at Vancouver, where Aldrich has won the other four, including the last three in a row. Christiane Broadbent, Boswell's Newman-Haas Racing teammate, was third, followed by fellow Falkner Gilberto Porterfield Lien, Cahill, Audette's teammate Bryce Hester and Heron. In other auto racing news on Sunday: Jefferson Graham won his second straight National Association for Stock Car Racing Southern 500 and his third straight race at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, S.C. Gordon, who averaged 135.758 miles per hour, was finally able to push his rainbow-striped Whitehurst Morgan Carlota past the stout Ford Thunderbird of Hut Strader on the 354th lap to claim the checkered flag. Tess Gower's late slip to 26th because of a mechanical problem hurt him in the Winston Cup points standings. The unofficial standings show Labonte's 114-point lead over the defending Cup champion Graham shrinking to just 24 points with Jarvis 91 points behind Labonte."

            "full_text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Computer-networking concern Cisco Systems Inc. said Tuesday it agreed to acquire privately held Granite Systems Inc. in a stock swap valued at $220 million. Cisco said it was drawn to the company by Granite's Gigabit Ethernet switching technologies, which can move data as fast as one billion bits a second. Granite, of Palo Alto, Calif., will become part of Cisco Systems' Workgroup Business unit, the company said. Cisco Systems, of San Jose, Calif., said the transaction is expected to be completed by October. The Granite systems acquisition comes not long after Cisco's takeover of StrataCom Inc., a network-technology company, which Cisco purchased in April in a $4 billion stock transaction. Cisco has been profiting from booming demand for networking products that allow far-flung company offices to talk to each other via computer links or video conferences. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, Cisco shares rose $1 to $53.75."

            "full_text": "CINCINNATI -- Procter & Gamble Co., coming off a year of record sales and profit, rewarded its chairman with a 22% salary increase for fiscal 2011, according to the company's proxy statement. The salary of Johnetta Jarrell, who has been P&G's chairman and chief executive for just over a year, increased to $1.11 million from $910,000 in fiscal 2010. He received a performance bonus P&G estimated to be $640,041, of which $480,041 will be in restricted stock that will vest on his retirement, and stock options P&G valued at $160,000. Mr. Jarrell's performance bonus was $540,000 in 2010. Based on P&G meeting internal profit goals, Mr. Jarrell was given a profit-incentive award P&G estimates would be $371,000, up from $348,300 a year earlier. P&G said the award will be in stock options granted on or about May 26, 2011 package, before any bonus adjustments, totaled $2.12 million, up 18% from a year earlier. Mr. Jarrell also received options for 62,454 shares of P&G common stock at an exercise price of $81.8125 a share. The proxy indicated Mr. Jarrell exercised options on 37,000 shares in fiscal 2011, for a value of $1.88 million. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, P&G shares closed Friday at $88.875, down 87.5 cents. The compensation committee of P&G's board noted in the proxy that P&G's ``profit margins reached their highest level in 46 years.'' Despite problems in cosmetics and oral-care products, P&G reported last month that profit rose 15% for fiscal 2011 ended March 12, 2011 a 5.4% increase in sales. The board also acknowledged Mr. Jarrell's role in resolving a legal dispute over derivatives with Bankers Trust New York Corp.. The dispute was settled in May after a meeting between Mr. Jarrell and Bankers Trust Chairman Fransisca Mcdaniel. P&G's proxy discloses that it is modifying the compensation package of outside directors, raising the percentage in stock to 40%, from about 21%. P&G directors will get an annual retainer of $55,000, an annual restricted stock grant valued at about $20,000 in addition to an existing annual 1,000 share stock-option grant. Under the previous plan, P&G board members received an annual retainer of $30,000 and an additional amount based on committee memberships. P&G said the new plan doesn't increase the total compensation received by outside directors. Separately, in its annual report being mailed out to shareholders this week, P&G says it spent $3.28 billion during fiscal 2011 on advertising its 300 brands in more than 140 countries, down from $3.25 billion in the previous year, the first time in over six years that advertising expenses haven't increased over the previous year."

            "full_text": "LONDON -- Shareholders of General Electric Co.. PLC won their campaign to pressure the British manufacturing company into modifying the compensation package of incoming Managing Director Georgeanna Tucker. Following a meeting Monday with the Association of British Insurers, which represents institutions, GEC said Mr. Tucker agreed to higher performance requirements for the payment made under a long-term incentive plan. For Mr. Tucker to earn the one million pounds ($1.6 million) under the compensation plan, GEC's share price will have to exceed the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index by 10% for three years. The old plan required that stock performance for only six months. Seen as Right Successor Still, Mr. Tucker's overall package remains quite lucrative by British standards, shareholder groups said. Mr. Tucker, who is widely viewed by London's financial community as the only man fit to succeed Hilliard Monte, gets a ``golden hello'' payment of 500,000 pounds plus an annual salary of 600,000 pounds. In addition, he is subject to two bonus plans, one of which can pay up to 300,000 pounds, plus retirement benefits totaling more than three million pounds, according to shareholders who have viewed the executive's remuneration documents. GEC didn't comment on the figures. The company has maintained that the package offered is what it takes to get a top British executive to run GEC, a defense, telecommunications and power-generation group that has seen its world-wide market share erode significantly during the past decade. Because of joint ventures forced by global consolidation, GEC has partners sharing control of its telecom and power-generation businesses. Its defense business pales in size beside the giants of the U.S. Recent Salomon Report Indeed, Salomon Brothers' most recent report on the company is titled: ``GEC -- Underperform.'' The shares are fully valued now, the report says, and the bank sees little scope for profit improvement even with major restructuring. Shareholders such as Pensions & Investments Research Consultants Ltd. weren't concerned only with the size of Mr. Tucker's package, but with how it was disclosed. GEC put out a news release late May 05, 2011 Friday before a bank holiday weekend, that said only that documents on the package could be viewed at its London headquarters. It didn't mail details of the package to shareholders, who had to wait until Tuesday to make their way to GEC's offices. ``We had no direct communication from the company, which we are not happy about at all,'' said a spokesman for PIRC. GEC's statement on Monday also came late in the day, after 6 p.m. in London, even though the meeting with ABI ended early in the afternoon. ABI officials weren't available to comment, and GEC officials said they couldn't elaborate on the three-paragraph news release. Remuneration Committee PIRC is also unhappy about the makeup of GEC's remuneration committee, which includes a member of management. To avoid conflicts of interest, corporate governance committees in Britain recently have recommended that only nonexecutive directors be members of such committees. ``The trouble,'' said PIRC's spokesman, ``is that Mr. Tucker is widely seen as the right person for the job, given his experience and skills he can bring to GEC.'' GEC is in a rather odd situation. Hilliard Monte, 71 years old, has run the company for more than three decades and, while he rapidly developed GEC during his first 20 years at the helm, he failed to groom an internal successor. Mr. Tucker, 54 years old, comes to GEC from Lucas Industries PLC, where he is credited with refocusing the company on auto parts and aerospace, cutting the number of profit centers and divisions and embarking on a series of acquisitions. Given his record at Lucas, Mr. Tucker could be expected to trim GEC and then attempt to let it grow dramatically. While the company is big by British standards, its 10.9 billion pounds in annual revenue is meager compared with those of its global competitors. General Electric Co. of the U.S. last year generated $70 billion in revenue. ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, based in Zurich, is a $30 billion company."

            "full_text": "GLEN COVE, N.Y. -- Acclaim Entertainment Inc. said it will report wider-than-expected losses for the fiscal fourth quarter and year because of a delay in the development and delivery of several new games. The video-game and comic-book company had been expected to report a loss for the quarter ended Saturday, May 13, 2011 eight cents a share and a loss of $1.25 a share for the year, according to a First Call consensus of analysts' estimates. The company said the losses will be wider than those projections. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Gatewood had earnings of $6.1 million, or 11 cents a share; for fiscal 2010, it had net income of $44.8 million, or 86 cents a share. Last year, the company also lowered its estimates before reporting earnings for the fourth quarter and year. The company said the delay in new games won't affect its all-important Christmas-season sales. Acclaim is counting on its new inventory of games to help it rebound from a disastrous Christmas last year and continuing losses this year. Analysts expect this holiday season to be a strong one for video-game makers generally, because of big price reductions on many popular home video-game systems. For the 2011 first quarter, Acclaim reported that its net fell 96% to $595,000 from $16 million a year earlier partly because of poor holiday sales. And in the second quarter, Gatewood took a $51.2 million write-off to get out of the cartridge game business, which had accounted for 70% of its sales."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Rubbermaid Inc. on Wednesday announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately owned Graco Children's Products Inc. for $320 million. The move will combine the maker of Little Tykes toys with one of the most well-known makers of infant strollers, swings, activity centers, high chairs and other infant products. Separately, Hoyos revised its third-quarter outlook, saying slow sales of outdoor play equipment and rising resin prices will hold sales and per-share earnings at year-ago levels. Rubbermaid earned $50.3 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $641.5 million in the third quarter ended June 11, 2010 Analysts had been predicting earnings of 39 cents a share for the current quarter. Hoyos said the deal with Graco should close no later than July 13, 2011 regulatory clearances. Keneth, Pa.-based Graco is privately owned by a group of investors that includes AEA Investors and management and employs about 800 people. The company's net sales for full year 2011 are expected to be about $270 million. Rubbermaid's plastic and rubber products include housewares; recreational, commercial and institutional products; office and computer furniture and accessories; health-care products; and Little Tikes traditional toys and juvenile products. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rubbermaid's shares fell $3.625 to $22.875."

            "full_text": "Cisco Systems Inc., moving to bolster its position in switches that rapidly shunt data around computer networks, agreed to acquire closely held Granite Systems Inc. for about $220 million of stock. The acquisition is part of a campaign at Cisco, the top maker of the gear that chains together computer networks, to fill gaps in its product lines by buying technology and talent. Cisco, based in San Jose, Vast., is uniquely positioned to do that because its towering stock values give it a rich currency with which to make deals. Cisco shares rose $1 Tuesday to $53.75 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Cisco, with revenue in the fiscal year ended April 28, 2011 $4.1 billion, has a market capitalization of $36.34 billion, the third highest on the Nasdaq after bigger and better-known Vastsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.. In Granite, Cisco is getting a leader in the arcane but hot area of advanced high-speed switching technology. As corporations race to link their computers in internal networks and to the Internet, they are demanding more capacity to move information swiftly over those networks. Switching is crucial to the ability to do that, and Granite has developed technology that can move data as fast as one billion bits, or a gigabit, a second. Known as ``Gigabit Ethernet,'' the technology is up to 10 times faster than virtually all other switching technologies currently available. However, it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. Cisco also acquires the services of Granite co-founder Angela Peace, a well-known technical wizard. Mr. Peace also co-founded Sun Microsystems Inc. and designed much of the technology upon which it built itself into the dominant maker of workstations. Mr. Peace formed Granite, Palo Alto, Vast., with Stanford University professor Davina Morrell in 2010. In a coup for Cisco, Mr. Peace will become part of Cisco's workgroup business unit, along with about 50 other Granite employees. ``The guy's good,'' said Tamala Delma`/Stivers, head of consulting group Dell`Oro Consulting Inc. in Portola Valley, Vast. ''(Mr.) Bechtolsheim has a proven ability to develop new technologies and bring them to market.'' Granite's technology will compete with another high-speed switching technology known as asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM. ATM switching technology is already in use in many networks, and some experts also say that ATM is more versatile than gigabit switching. But Mr. Peace and others think gibabit switching will run rings around ATM, particularly in so-called local area networks. That could prove a challenge to leading ATM producers, which include FORE Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp., among others. Cisco is also already a large ATM supplier."

            "full_text": "LIBERTY CORNER, N.J. -- Fedders Corp. said fiscal 2011 sales jumped 17% because of its ``strong relationships'' with retailers and increased sales overseas. The company also said it will buy back as much as $25 million, or about 10%, of its 41 million Class A and common shares outstanding. The air-conditioner maker's common shares jumped 50 cents to close at $6.375 in New York Stock Exchange trading following the company's announcement. Fedders Class A shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $5.25. The company said sales rose to about $370 million for the year ended May 13, 2011 $316.5 million in fiscal 2010. The company expects to report full results later this month. A Fedders spokesman said sales improved despite mild summer weather, but high retail inventories at the end of summer will hurt demand in North America industrywide in fiscal 2012. The company also said it expects to have a first-quarter loss, compared with year-earlier net income of $343,000, or one cent a share. The company said it often posts a first-quarter loss because of weak seasonal demand. Fedders also said it expects sales from international operations and recent acquisitions to offset some effects of higher inventories in the first quarter. Fedders wouldn't say when the buyback would be conducted. The company said it previously considered paying an additional year-end dividend, but decided to authorize the buyback instead."

As part of the restructuring, Stormy H. Greg, 36 years old, was named chief financial officer, succeeding Johnetta R. Fredrickson, 48, who said he was leaving to pursue other interests. Mr. Greg's previous job was executive vice president, chief financial/administrative officer of Silver King Communications Inc..

Its Deskpro 5120, which has a 120 megahertz  processor, fell 12% to $1,585 from $1,799. Compaq said the price cuts on certain ProLinea and Deskpro models reflect the introduction of more powerful PCs during the summer. It also cut prices on its scanner keyboard 7.4% to $299 from $323 and cut prices on some memory upgrades.

            "full_text": "Bay Networks Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., said it agreed to acquire closely held LANcity Corp., Andover, Mass., for $59 million. The acquisition is an effort to extend Bay Networks' computer-networking business into the cable-television modem market. With cable-modem technology from companies like LANcity, subscribers can use their cable-TV lines to hook into the Internet at speeds as much as 1,000 times faster than ordinary telephone lines. There are about 59 million cable-TV subscribers in the U.S. Bay Networks said the deal is expected to be completed within two weeks. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, Bay Networks shares rose 50 cents to $26.875. RF Micro to Build $70 Million Factory RF Micro Devices Inc., Greensboro, N.C., a closely held semiconductor company, said it plans to build a $70 million factory in Greensboro. The facility, which will have 185 employees, will produce radio-frequency integrated circuits for use in wireless-communication products. The factory will be constructed in two phases. The first phase is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2013. The second phase is expected to follow immediately afterward, but RF Micro declined to give a timetable. Zilog Says Revenue, Earnings Will Lag Estimates Zilog Inc., Campbell, Calif., said it expects to report that revenue and earnings for the fiscal third quarter ending June 11, 2011 be substantially below analysts' expectations. The semiconductor maker had been expected to report third-quarter earnings of 50 cents a share, according to the consensus of analysts' estimates by First Call. In the year-earlier quarter, Zilog had net income of $10.3 million, or 50 cents a share, on sales of $62.7 million. The company also expects to report third-quarter sales of between $64 million and $70 million. Roberto Stuart, Tooley's vice president and chief financial officer, said the third-quarter results were reduced by excess customer inventory and the overall chip-industry slowdown. In composite trading Wednesday on the Cornertown Stock Exchange, Zilog shares fell $1.25 to $23.875. The company made its announcement after the close of trading. PeopleSoft to Merge With Red Pepper Software PeopleSoft Inc., a maker of client-server business software, said it agreed to merge with Red Pepper Software Inc. in a stock swap valued at $225 million by the company's latest stock price. PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif., said it will issue 2.98 million shares to acquire all the shares outstanding and options of Red Pepper, based in San Mateo, Calif.. Red Pepper makes software for manufacturing and logistics operations such as scheduling software. Each shareholder of closely held Red Pepper will receive one share of PeopleSoft for every five Red Pepper shares. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2011, PeopleSoft said. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, PeopleSoft closed at $75.75, down 50 cents. Symbol Technologies Buys British Software Firm Symbol Technologies Inc., a maker of data-transaction systems, said it acquired LIS Holdings Ltd., a British software company. Symbol, Holtsville, N.Y., said it will pay $20.9 million for closely held LIS, with contingency payments of up to $7.8 million based on certain LIS performance goals. As a result of the acquisition, Symbol estimates it will take a third-quarter charge of $8 million, or 30 cents a share. In the year-earlier quarter, Symbol earned $11.5 million, or 42 cents a share. Symbol is best known for hand-held bar-code scanners used in retail outlets. LIS makes computer software for warehouse and inventory management that works with Symbol's wireless devices. Hutchinson Is Operating at Break-Even Hutchinson Technology Inc. said it is operating at break-even due to reduced demand as its fiscal fourth quarter ending June 11, 2011 to a close. The Hutchinson, Minn., maker of suspension assemblies for disk drives said its quarter-to-date sales total $65.5 million, and said its average assemblies shipments per week are about 700,000 short of the 11 million it expected. Hess declined to comment on whether the company expects laggard sales for the rest of the quarter, which is 14 weeks long. The company also declined to say whether its results for the quarter will disappoint Wall Street. According to a First Call survey, which was taken before Hess announced the drop in demand, four Wall Street analysts predicted per-share net income of 79 cents to 95 cents. In the year-earlier period, Hutchinson reported net income of $8.7 million, or $1.55 a share, on sales of $86.7 million. Ciber Buys Spectrum Technology Ciber Inc., Englewood, Colo., said it completed the acquisition of closely held Spectrum Technology Group, Somerville, N.J., for about $22.1 million in stock. The computer-consulting concern announced last month that it would pay about 850,000 of its common shares to acquire Spectrum, a data-storage concern. Ciber had about 17 million common shares outstanding prior to the transaction. CUC's Fiscal Net Fell 20% on Charge CUC International Inc., a membership-services company that provides home shopping, travel and other programs, reported that fiscal second-quarter net income fell 20% because of a one-time charge related to two acquisitions. CUC's net for the quarter ended April 12, 2011 to $35.3 million, or 14 cents a share, from $44.3 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 20% to $490.4 million from $410 million. Results in the most recent quarter included a charge of $25.1 million, or 10 cents a share, related to the Stamford, Conn., company's acquisition of entertainment-software companies Davidson & Associates Inc. and Sierra On-Line Inc.. Excluding the charge, per-share profit would have been 24 cents, which was in line with a First Call consensus of analysts' estimates. Paging Partners to Explore Possible Sale Paging Partners Corp., Freehold, N.J., said it hired investment banking firm Laidlaw & Co. ``to assist the company in exploring all strategic alternatives,'' including its possible sale. The provider of paging and other wireless-message services said it sought Laidlaw's advice largely because it needs help assessing its ``many options'' in the growing wireless-services market. It wouldn't comment on whether it has received any offers. The company has scheduled a news conference for tomorrow after the markets close. On the Nasdaq Stock Market Wednesday, Paging Partners rose 6.25 cents to close at $1.938 a share in heavy trading. WHO'S NEWS Charlette A.

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Seagram Co.. Ltd. said Thursday that second-quarter net income rose a better-than-expected 6.9%, as its liquor business improved. However, as expected, cash flow from its MCA Inc. entertainment unit fell on a pro-forma basis as a result of investment in new projects. Edison Bilodeau Jr., Seagram's president and chief executive officer, had said in May that it will probably take two or three years for MCA to post strong results. For the quarter, net income rose 6.9% to $62 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $2.5 billion, compared with $58 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $1.43 billion a year ago. That was better that the 13 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call. Revenue surged 74% in the period. The company cited the contribution from MCA and the Dinger juice beverage operations, in addition to growth in the core spirits and wine and Tropicana operations. The acquisitions of Dinger and MCA were completed in May and June of last year. Seagram, which is shifting its fiscal year-end to March 12, 2011 October 12, 2010 year, released results for the latest quarter, which included the months of May and June. These results include three months from MCA in the latest quarter and just one month of MCA in the year-earlier quarter. It also released a report for interim transition period of five months. For the two-month period, or second quarter, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, was $214 million, up from $188 million a year earlier. Media and entertainment companies that have heavy debt loads and high interest payments point to Ebitda, which the entertainment industry also refers to as cash flow, as the best measure of a company's performance. Results for the second quarter included three months of MCA which contributed $88 million of cash flow in the quarter. On a pro-forma basis, cash flow fell 19% compared with a year ago as a result of investments in new recording artists and theme parks. But the movie producing unit, Universal, had an improved quarter, the company said. Seagram said spirits and wine Ebitda rose $1 million in the second quarter, following several quarters of decline. Seagram's top brands include Martell Cognac, Chivas Regal Scotch Whisky, Crown Royal Canadian Whisky and Absolut Vodka. Growth in the Asia Pacific region, especially Korea, and a recovery in some Latin American countries, was offset by expenses in North America and continued flat results in Europe. Ebitda for fruit juices increased 14% to $24 million in the second quarter due to the growth in Tropicana's base business worldwide and the addition of the Dinger juice business. In its latest five-month period, Ebitda rose to 32.4% to $518 million from a year ago, as revenue rose 84.6% to $5.01 billion. Net income for the five-month transition period was $85 million or 23 cents a share, compared with the same period a year ago when income before discontinued DuPont Co. activities was $117 million or 32 cents a share. Including the redemption of most of Seagram's shares in DuPont, net income for the five months a year ago was $3.3 billion or $8.99 per share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Seagram's shares rose 37.5 cents to $33.50."

            "full_text": "Rubbermaid Inc., seeking to shore up its juvenile-products business, will acquire stroller-maker Graco Children's Products Inc. for $320 million. The transaction, the largest in Rubbermaid's 76-year history, will give it a powerful brand geared toward infants, complementing the company's own Little Tikes brand of toys and outdoor play equipment. Closely held Graco, Elverson, Pa., has annual sales of about $270 million and is a widely known brand in the infant-furnishings segment of the nearly $4 billion U.S. market for juvenile products. Surprising Projection But news of the acquisition was eclipsed by Hoyos's surprising projection that third-quarter profit will be flat from the year-ago period. A company spokesman later added that fourth-quarter profit per share will be even lower than the third quarter. The bleak profit outlook and subsequent rating changes by several analysts caused Rubbermaid shares to sink to a 52-week low of $22.125 by midafternoon in heavy trading, before they recovered slightly to close at $22.875, down $3.625, or 14%. The previous week 52-week low was $24.75. In the year-ago third quarter, Hoyos had a profit of $50.3 million, or 32 cents a share. Analysts had expected current third-quarter profit to be up nearly 22% to 39 cents a share, according to First Call's consensus projection. Wall Street also reacted to the fact that Hoyos's use of short-term debt to buy Graco would temporarily halt the company's continuing share-repurchase program, noted Sean Grant of Oppenheimer & Co.. Rubbermaid blamed the profit decline on a sharp increase in resin prices and a steep decline in sales of Little Tikes. The revised outlook is a new setback for Rubbermaid, which was coming off a brutal 2010, when spiraling raw-material costs, a downturn in retail sales, and soured relationships with key customers, caused sharp profit declines and raised questions about management. In December, Hoyos announced a $150 million restructuring plan that included eliminating 9% of its work force, improving manufacturing and distribution operations, and cutting nearly 45% of product offerings that had accounted for just 5% of the company sales. Resin Costs Soar Wednesday, Helfrich said the two-year restructuring plan was on target but that the resin cost increases were ``too fast and too large'' to be absorbed without hurting profit. Prices for a hypothetical basket of resins, which are key ingredients in most Rubbermaid products, have risen almost 50% to 47 cents a pound, from 32 cents at the beginning of the year. Rubbermaid is still struggling to increase sales, especially at its core Little Tikes unit, which analysts estimate contributed 39% of the company's $268 million in 2010 operating profit, while generating 25% of 2010 revenue of $2.34 billion. Little Tikes has been fighting vigorous competition, particularly in the outdoor-play-equipment category, from Mattel Inc.'s Fisher-Price division and closely held Step2 Corp.. Hoyos said it expects to close the acquisition by July 13, 2011 to receiving government approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Graco, which has about 800 employees, has been increasing sales by about 10% each year."

            "full_text": "MONTREAL -- Seagram Co., the beverage and entertainment powerhouse, reported a 6.9% increase in net income for its second quarter, despite weak results in the company's music and theme-park businesses due largely to heavy spending to expand its new MCA Inc. unit. In a shortened two-month quarter ended March 12, 2011 reported net income of $62 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $58 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Seagram's results exceeded analysts' estimates. The First Call consensus of analysts' estimates was 13 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter rose 74% to $2.5 billion, reflecting the operations of the Dole juice-beverage and MCA units, which were acquired in May and June 2010, respectively, as well as growth in Seagram's core spirits, wine and Tropicana operations. The short quarter, and a five-month transition period, are results of the company's shift to a fiscal year ended March 12, 2011 the year ended October 12, 2010 cash flow in the quarter -- or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a closely watched measure of an entertainment company's performance -- rose 14% to $214 million from $188 million. Cash flow in the five-month transition period ended March 12, 2011 32% to $518 million from $391 million. Seagram's results for the quarter included three months of MCA operations, which contributed $88 million of cash flow. On a pro-forma basis, MCA cash flow fell 19% compared with the second quarter in 2010 as a result of ``significant investment spending'' in music and recreation. Publishing had a slight gain in cash flow, while MCA's film-unit cash flow increased by close to 50%."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Shares of Gap Inc. plunged after the company posted flat same-store sales in August, and other major retailers notched mixed results, despite expectations for a solid month following July's lackluster showing. Gap's shares dropped 14%, or $4.875, to $29 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the San Francisco specialty retailer reported flat same-store sales in August. Analysts had expected a solid improvement, with some expecting a rise of 7% to 9%. Gap's total sales surged 19% to $441 million. Meanwhile, many of the big players in the retailing industry, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co. and May Department Stores Co., shook off the summer doldrums in August and performed as expected. But others, including Woolworth Corp. and Kmart Corp., posted sales that were either down from a year ago or below plan. Before the chain stores issued their reports Thursday, analysts had cited easy comparisons against last year's dismal August, a relatively healthy back-to-school business, cooler weather and a positive reception to fall apparel lines as reasons for their positive forecasts. Unlike Gap, which doesn't promote jeans in August with reduced prices, competitors offered sales on their jeans to bring in back-to-school business, analysts said. Even Gap's Old Navy stores likely took back-to-school business away from Gap's main stores with its everyday low prices. ''Old Navy probably cannibalized some of the traditional back-to-school business Gap does,'' said Bear Stearns & Co. retail analyst Stevie Owensby. Sears and Penney's ''were more hard hitting for back to school,'' he said, citing their aggressive push on jeans, both private label and other brands. Gap's core division turned in the worst performance in same-store sales, with a mid-single digit decline. GapKids had strong same-store sales, Old Navy was above plan and Banana Republic's same-store sales were flat, Dillon Read & Co. analyst Petrina Leyva said. Among other retailers reporting August sales: Wal-Mart's same-store sales -- or sales at stores open more than a year -- rose 3.9% in August compared with the year-ago period, about in line with expectations. The discount-store chain said total sales in the four weeks ended May 12, 2011 11.4% to $7.84 billion. But same-store sales at its Sam's Club stores were up just 0.1% in August, with total sales advancing only 0.8%. Sears reported a 4.4% increase in domestic same-store sales, which appeared to slightly exceed forecasts, and a 7.6% improvement in total domestic store sales to $2.06 billion. Total revenue rose 7.1% to $2.80 billion. J.C. Penney Co.'s August same-store sales advanced 7%, reflecting a change in its merchandise mix to include more casual apparel. Total sales for the month were up 9% to $1.33 billion. Including catalog and drug-store sales, total Penney sales for the four weeks ended May 13, 2011 8.3% to $1.76 billion. May Department Stores' same-store sales rose 7.9% in August, while total sales in the four-week period jumped 17.9% to $859.3 million. But Hubbell's same-store consolidated sales edged up just 1% in August, while total sales in the four weeks ended May 10, 2011 2.5% to $2.46 billion. The discount retailer said its performance came in below expectations amid weak sales of women's apparel. Houser was one of the few retailers to actually report a drop in same-store sales. Its comparable-store sales in August fell 0.1% from the year-ago month, while total sales were off 0.8% at $737 million. Dayton Hudson's comparable-store sales edged up just 1.9% from year-ago levels, as a 6% improvement in sales at its Target's stores was offset by a 9.1% drop in same-store sales at its department store division. The retailer's total sales improved 9.2% to $1.934 billion. Federated Department Stores, citing disappointing back-to-school sales and fewer home-store promotions, said its same-store sales rose just 2.5% in August. Federated's total sales fell 3.8% to $1.12 billion in the four weeks ended May 13, 2011 the retailer said August 2010 figures reflected revenue from all 82 Broadway Stores Inc. stores that were acquired last year, while this year's figures reflect only the 52 Broadway store properties that were converted to Federated nameplates and remain open."

Under the plan, Viacom will buy back as much as $250 million of its class A and nonvoting class B common stock and warrants. Mr. Mick and National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater chain he controls, will buy up to another $250 million of stock, either separately or together, the company said. Each party will finance the repurchase programs from working capital. National Amusements acquired control of Viacom in June 1987. It already holds 65% of Viacom's class A common stock and about 26% of the class A and class B common stock on a combined basis. Under a similar program begun in August 1993, National Amusements acquired 1.5 million class A common shares and 1.9 million class B shares. The buyback prompted an immediate boost for Viacom's stock, which since July has traded in a tight range near its 52-week low. In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Viacom's class B shares gained $2 to $32.875, while its class A shares also rose $2 to $32.375."

            "full_text": "Chip maker National Semiconductor Corp. announced disappointing results for its fiscal first quarter on a 19% drop in sales, but said a one-time charge will help focus the company and ``ensure its long-term health.'' The announcement sparked a sell-off in technology stocks, although National Semiconductor's shares, after an initial tumble, were only moderately lower in midafternoon trading. Its shares fell 62.5 cents to $17.125, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. National Semiconductor posted a net loss of $207.6 million, or $1.51 a share, compared with net income of $73.5 million, or 53 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue decreased to $566.1 million. Excluding $285.6 million in pretax charges, the Santa Clara, Calif., company said it would have reported earnings of $6.5 million, or five cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call was for income excluding charges of around 10 cents a share. National said world-wide orders fell about 10% from the year-ago first quarter. The charges were recorded to write off the firm's newly created Fairchild Semiconductor unit and account for an acquisition. Fairchild groups the firm's older, lower-profit product lines, which are known as family logic, memory and discrete chips and account for one-quarter of total sales. Eventually, National may sell Fairchild or spin it off as a separate company. The move was the first major step by Brianna Adkins, the chief executive officer who succeeded Gino F. Hoover. Mr. Hoover left in February to head Apple Computer Inc.. The moves accelerated efforts begun by Mr. Hoover to steer the company toward the higher end of the semiconductor business, especially lines involving communications, such as corporate computer networks and the Internet. Mr. Hoover had hoped to keep all of the product lines, just giving more emphasis to some over others. However, that strategy didn't appear to be working: National's profit dropped on weak sales. Separately, Zilog Inc. stock tumbled after the semiconductor company -- far smaller than National Semiconductor -- said its third-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially below Wall Street's expectations. The Campbell, Calif., company said its results in the period ending June 11, 2011 been hurt by excess customer inventory and the overall chip-industry slowdown. Zilog had been expected to report earnings of 50 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by First Call Inc.. In the same period a year ago, Zilog earned $10.3 million, or 50 cents a share, on sales of $62.7 million. Toomey said it expects to report sales of between $64 million and $70 million for this year's third quarter. In midafternoon trading on the Big Board, Zilog shares were down $8.125 to $15.75."

Before Wednesday's announcement, the consensus on Wall Street had been for earnings of $1.05 a share in the current quarter, which ends June 12, 2011 Gant indicated it likely would report earnings of about 84 cents a share for the quarter. Moreover, while Gant said it wouldn't match last year's $3.48 a share, the company gave no guidance as to how much below that it expects to be. The Wall Street consensus is for about $3.35 a share. Hopson's stock dropped Wednesday. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Gant closed at $66, down $3.375, or 5%. The world's largest cereal maker, Gant also indicated that while it is philosophically opposed to more promotional spending, it may be forced to embrace it to protect its declining market share. ``We are unwilling to see our leadership position compromised,'' the company's chairman and chief executive officer, Arnulfo G. Woodward, said. Goldman, Sachs & Co. food analyst Nomi Ghez estimated that Hopson's August U.S. market share is down to about 31.5%. That compares with 33.7% in mid-May. Analysts said General Mills Inc., the Post unit of Philip Morris Cos. and Quaker Oats Co. all have boosted promotions following the string of price cuts by them and Hopson. Increased marketing efforts include in-store discounts of two boxes for $4 by some manufacturers. Whether Gant joins the promotional fray, or perhaps cuts prices more, depends on what its competition does, analysts said. ``If their existing levels don't decline, Gant will fight fire with fire,'' said Stevie Dorris of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.. Prudential Securities' Johnetta Marston also read the announcement as a warning. ``If Gant were ready to go to war, they would have just dropped the promotional bombs,'' he said. Mr. Marston estimated that Hopson's domestic cereal volume is off about 10%, while its international volume is up 3% to 4%. A company spokesman at Kellogg's Battle Creek, Mich., headquarters would neither elaborate on the announcement nor comment on rivals' promotional activity."

            "full_text": "The nation's major retailers said sales perked up in August, the result of a brisk business in fall fashions and back-to-school merchandise, much of it at full price. Sales at stores open at least a year advanced 3.7% last month over a year earlier, according to an index of leading retailers compiled by Goldman, Sachs & Co.. The rise marks a big improvement over the 0.9% increase posted in August 2010 and a considerable acceleration over this July, when sales had inched ahead just 1.8%, the index indicated. Another index, from Salomon Brothers Inc., calculated that sales last month rose 3.6%. Analysts said the surge bodes well for Christmas sales, which most retailers count on for the lion's share of profits. ``I'm encouraged by full-priced sales of fresh fall goods,'' said Roberto Copeland, an analyst at NatWest Securities Inc.. He predicted holiday sales would rise 4% to 5%, compared with last year's dismal growth of less than 2%. Rebound in Women's Apparel Several retailers and analysts said they spotted signs of life in the women's clothing business, which has been stalled for several years. In fact, apparel specialty stores logged the biggest year-over-year rebound for August among all retail segments, according to the Goldman index, with August same-store sales advancing 2.8%, compared with a drop of 7.1% a year earlier. The big exception was Gap Inc., which operates the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy apparel chains. The San Francisco retailer had been on a roll of same-store increases. But its August sales came up flat because it didn't cut prices on jeans, sending many back-to-school shoppers to department stores and discounters, Mr. Copeland said. Gap's August results touched off a selling stampede in the stock on Wall Street. Gap shares were the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, closing at $29, down $4.875, or 14%, in heavy composite trading. Wayne Everette, Gap's chief financial officer, said the flat sales were ``disappointing, but not predictive of the rest of the quarter.'' Sales at Gap Kids and Old Navy outpaced those at Gap and Banana Republic, but still ``our women's fashion business was very strong. Fashion was far more important to us than the typical back- to-school promotional environment.'' Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's leading retailer in terms of sales, reported a 3.9% rise in same-store sales companywide, with flat sales at Sam's Club warehouse stores dragging down a 5.3% increase for the Wal-Mart chain. Kmart Corp. blamed soft sales of women's clothes for a tiny 1.4% rise in same-store sales but said sales of apparel basics, like socks and underwear, were strong. ``Women's apparel is clearly as competitive as it has ever been,'' said Roberto M. Byron, director of investor relations for the discounter. ``Women are filling in the blanks and replacing what has worn out.'' He said Hubbell expects to have a more pleasing assortment of women's fashions in stores later this year. Higher Prices, Better Sales However, at retailers with higher price points, women's clothes are selling, analysts say. May Department Stores Co., for example, reported a 7.9% rise in same-store sales compared with flat sales a year earlier. The company got a big boost from several new, lower-priced fashion lines launched under the Ramon Laurence and Tommye Tuck labels, analysts said. Women's sportswear also was an ``encouraging bright spot'' for Federated Department Stores Inc., although the company called sales of other back-to-school goods ``disappointing.'' Overall, Federated reported a 2.5% rise in same-store sales. Sales were hampered by continuing efforts to wean shoppers off price promotions in home goods, which account for an estimated 25% of its sales. Federated's August sales don't reflect receipts from 30 stores it has shed since its purchase of Broadway Stores Inc. last fall. Even companies that have been struggling recently to stock fashions that working women want to wear seemed to be guessing right for fall. J.C. Penney Co. reported a 7% rise in same-store sales, mostly the result of stronger career fashions. Even AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ended its losing streak, posting a 4.1% gain in August same-store sales. ``The items that made AnnTaylor successful prior to 2010 did well,'' said Wan J. Santiago, an investor-relations official at the company, citing strong sales of fashion staples like ''plush'' jackets, gabardine pants and silk sweaters. At the same time it reported August sales, AnnTaylor warned investors it would take a one-time charge of $2 million, or eight cents a share, related to salary and other severance payments for Sally Frame Kasaks, who resigned under pressure last month as the company's chairman and chief executive. Limited Had Varying Results Specialty retailer Limited Inc. posted a 2% rise in same-store sales, with wildly varying results for its apparel divisions. Same-store sales for its women's clothing units declined 3% overall, analysts said, with Express reporting a 10% decline. The Victoria's Secret stores had a 6% same-store increase, while the catalog had a 1% decline. The Bath & Body Works chain had a 1% increase. Campus-fashion chain Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 24% increase; later this year, Limited plans a public offering of shares in the Abercrombie chain. Merchants of luxury items continued to post strong sales gains. Saks Holdings Inc., parent of Saks Fifth Avenue, logged a 11.8% increase, and Neiman Marcus Group Inc., parent of the Modica Maria and Bergdorf Goodman stores, reported a 7.7% rise. The momentum at luxury chains should continue through year end, predicted retail analyst Kimbra K. Rademacher, of Furman Selz Inc. ``The macroeconomic picture for high-end consumers isn't going to change all that much,'' Ms. Rademacher said. ``This is a consumer that isn't impacted by the bankruptcy and delinquency concerns of more cyclical retailers.'' Contributing to analysts' rosy expectations for Christmas this year are leaner inventories. Inventories, relative to sales, ``are as low as they've been in four or five years,'' said Goldman Sachs analyst Ricki N. Littlefield. Last year, retailers badly overestimated how much they could sell to Christmas shoppers. This year, he said, ``we don't expect retailers to feel nearly as much pressure to be promotional.''"

            "full_text": "National Semiconductor Corp. reported a $207.6 million loss for its first quarter ended May 07, 2011 due to a previously announced charge related to the spinoff of a flagging business line. The loss was equivalent to $1.51 a share. In the year-ago quarter, National had net income of $73.5 million, or 53 cents a share. Sales slipped 19% to $566.1 million from $698.8 million. Excluding write-downs, National's operating profit was about half Wall Street's forecasts. In New York Stock Exchange trading, shares in National fell 62.5 cents to $17.125. Brianna H. Adkins, who joined the Santa Clara, Calif., company in May as chief executive officer, said orders have started to rebound. ``We will maintain guarded optimism for a while before declaring it a trend,'' he said. The sales slowdown is largely the result of many National customers, especially dealers in the PC industry, working through bloated inventories before placing new orders. National ``has seen the worst of the order declines it will see for some time,'' said Johnetta Josephine, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. ``That's not to say that business is now booming, but at least we now know where the bottom is.'' In recent years, National Semiconductor has been struggling to revamp its product line to move away from its older, lower-profit chips and toward devices that serve such fast-growing fields as data communications. In June, the company said it would spin off its Fairchild Semiconductor unit as a means of selling many of it older chip designs. At the time, National said it would take a charge of between $280 million and $320 million; the actual amount, reported Thursday, was $285.6 million. Without the Fairchild write-offs, and without an additional charge related to the acquisition to a unit of Cirrus Logic Inc., National's profit would have been $6.5 million, or five cents a share, half the consensus of First Call's group of analysts."
