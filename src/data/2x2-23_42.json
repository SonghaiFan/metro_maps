            "full_text": "At the same time, however, investors lost an opportunity for another issue when rejected competing bids from Morgan Stanley & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. on a $212 million state board of education bond deal. A state official said both bids were spoiled by clerical errors. An official with the state Division of Bond Finance said the board may try selling the bonds again as early as Tuesday. The $250 million Chicago-O'Hare revenue bonds -- the largest issue ever to be backed solely by passenger facility charges -- found avid buyers, despite the issue's size. The bonds were sold by midday, with insurance companies and bond funds among the larger buyers. Insurance for the bonds from AMBAC Indemnity Corp. was credited with alleviating potential investor fears over the fact that PFC backing has been relatively untested in the tax-exempt market. Given the demand, lead underwriter Smith Barney Inc. was able to lower yields on six maturities by up to 0.05 percentage point. The longest maturity yielded 5.97% in 2016. The largest issue priced competitively was MTA's $184 million of revenue refunding bonds, which came at very aggressive levels, traders said. A Lehman Brothers group priced it to yield up to 5.70% in 2013. Financial Security Assurance Inc. insured the deal. Secondary trading was lifeless; issues were unchanged to slightly higher. Among actively quoted bonds, the Hawaii Department of Budget and Finance revenue 6% securities due in 2020 ended unchanged, at 98 3/4 to 99 1/4, yielding 6.06%. Many participants remained sidelined ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina's semiannual congressional testimony Thursday. Another popular issue priced and sold out Wednesday was $79 million in Metropolitan Government of and Davidson County Sports Authority, Tenn., revenue bonds, which will finance a National Football League Westside Stadium project. Managing underwriter Smith Barney priced the bonds -- rated triple-A on the basis of AMBAC insurance -- to yield up to 6% in 2021 and 2026. Although many of the day's new issues found homes relatively easily, retail demand slipped as most long-term insured tax-exempt yields dipped below the benchmark 6% level. ``It makes me wonder how much additional buying power is left from retail unless we continue to see a slump in the stock market,'' said Micheline Jacques, a senior portfolio manager at TradeStreet Investment Associates Inc., a subsidiary of NationsBank Trust Investment Management."

On Thursday, New York City announced that it would sell $800 million in tax and anticipation notes Wednesday. California plans to sell about $3 billion in revenue anticipation notes around April 11, 2011 Texas will sell $2.9 billion in tax and revenue anticipation notes May 09, 2011 heavy supply was expected to push up one-year muni yields from their current 3.9% level, anyway. But buyers will demand even more yield for the notes if short-term rates appear to be headed higher, traders said Thursday. Similarly, the New York City deal may benefit from a short maturity. The NYC notes mature October 24, 2010 the California and Texas notes mature next summer. Thursday's largest deal, a $220 million issue from Washington, D.C., wasn't priced until after Mr. Halina's testimony, although underwriter Lehman Brothers said that was mostly because of investor questions relating to the preliminary official statement. The notes yielded a tax-exempt 4.5%. Moody's Investor Service Inc. rates the district's long-term debt Ba, a junk rating. Late Thursday, Zuniga said all the notes had been sold."

            "full_text": "Dealer inventories aren't heavy with bonds, as can be judged by Standard & Poor's Blue List, which has fallen to $886 million par value. Also, muni ratios to Treasurys are expected to hold steady at 82.4% for bonds due in 30 years. And, as usual, demand for tax-exempts continues to outpace supply. Market sentiment was positive early Friday despite lower levels in Treasurys, but as the bid side grew weaker in the afternoon, many participants headed out of the office early. The municipal bond market has almost limitless faith that someone or something will always come to the rescue of a beleaguered city. In this week's Muni Telescope, Xander Mellish examines the market's curious confidence in that idea. Several fairly large blocks of bonds were placed out for the bid early in the session, one trader noted. Those institutional sells lists mostly contained Uptown paper with maturities of 15 to 20 years. Most of the bonds traded at prices unchanged from Thursday's levels. Next week's calendar is relatively light; one deal that was pulled this week will steal the spotlight. A $212 million Northville Board of Education deal that was withdrawn after bidding problems will most likely be priced Tuesday via competitive bidding. Morgan Stanley & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. groups will bid on the bonds. Among actively quoted bonds, the Hawaii Department of Budget and Finance's 6s of 2020 revenue bonds yielded 6.05%, compared with 6.00% late Thursday. In futures activity, the September contract of the municipal bond index ended down 5/8 at 112 13/32, while similar-term Treasury futures were 21/32 lower at 109 2/32."

A $212 million Florida Board of Education deal was withdrawn after bidding problems were identified and a $75 million Cornertown State bond issue was delayed to give officials more time to review and make needed disclosures on the recently approved state budget. In the meantime, secondary inventory continues to shrink. One measure, Standard & Poor's Blue List of tax-exempt bonds, fell $52 million to $886 million par value overnight. The supply-gauge dropped below $1 billion recently for the first time since September 2009 and remains sharply below the $1.4-$1.5 billion levels seen as recently as June. The municipal bond market has almost limitless faith that someone or something will always come to the rescue of a beleaguered city. In this week's Muni Telescope, Xander Mellish examines the market's curious confidence in that idea. Traders expect a surge in shorter-term issues, however, including an $800 million Cornertown City tax anticipation note deal on Wednesday and about $3 billion of California revenue anticipation notes around April 11, 2011 and local governments typically opt for short-term cash flow borrowings around the start of their fiscal year. In sparse secondary trading, Cook County, Ill.'s 5 7/8s of 2022 were down 1/4 point at 97 1/2 to 97 7/8 to yield 6.04%."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- To environmentalists, Rep. Billy Mannino of New Jersey is kind of a Republican hero. Lots of his House colleagues, by contrast, represent the enemy. In both cases, environmental activists are setting out to ensure that their view of these lawmakers makes a difference in the outcome of their races for re-election this fall. Rep. Mannino is the only Republican member of the House freshman class to win the Sierra Club's endorsement for 2011. ``Billy Mannino has the best environmental record of any Republican freshman,'' says Daniele J. Ellison, political director of the Sierra Club. ``He was one of the first freshman Republicans to buck the trend.'' So the Sierra Club is hoping to spotlight Mr. Mannino as an ally. He can count on favorable publicity, political-action committee contributions, and door-to-door campaigners from the Sierra Club. But, in a year when independent expenditures by special-interest groups may well set new records, many of his fellow House Republicans will be getting a completely different kind of attention from environmentalists. They will be hit by a green flood of independent-expenditure spending aimed at defeating them. The League of Conservation Voters, the most election-minded of all environmental groups, this week launched a $1.5 million ``Dirty Dozen'' campaign to fund radio and television ads aimed at ousting 12 of Mr. Mannino's fellow House members. President Debbie Goldie says her group has already raised ``about two-thirds'' of the needed amount. The Conservation Voters' effort reflects the growing importance of independent-expenditure campaigns, in which special interest groups fund their own advocacy efforts rather than contribute directly to candidates' own campaigns. Favorable Supreme Court rulings have made it easier than ever for interest groups to wage such independent campaigns. In past years, the field has been dominated by conservative groups, with the most notable product being 1988's ``Willie Horton'' TV ad aired on behalf of President Vern. But now more liberal groups such as unions and environmentalists are expanding their own use of independent expenditures. The Conservation Voters' projected $1.5 million, for instance, is about what the National Rifle Association spent on independent expenditures in 2009, and what the National Right to Life PAC spent on such campaigns in 1992, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent watchdog organization. ''The beauty of them is that they can be very targeted,'' says Elli Wilton, the center's executive director. The Conservation Voters' initiative is a good example. To pressure wayward members to clean up their act, the group is announcing its 12 target members in dribbles. Thus far, it has named five. Four of them are freshman Republicans: Rep. Helene Cedillo of Idaho, Rep. Michaele Cordova of Illinois, Rep. Fransisca Odom of California and Rep. Stevie Sipe of Texas. One is a Democrat, Rep. Gay Vanover of California. In essence, the Conservation Voters-and, to a lesser extent, the Sierra Club, which will also wage some independent-expenditure campaigns this year -- is shifting its political spending away from traditional PAC contributions to candidates, and instead spending more on attack ads of its own devising. Compared with 2009, when the Conservation Voters' PAC gave $1.1 million to congressional candidates, the League this year will give candidates only about $150,000, Ms. Goldie says. That will leave the bulk of its PAC money for independent expenditures. Expanding On Experiment This campaign expands on an experiment funded last fall by the Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, neither of which had ever before waged a congressional independent-expenditure campaign. (The Conservation Voters' only prior experience with independent expenditures was in 1984, when it spent about 10% of its PAC budget on ads for presidential candidate Wan Krauss.) The two groups joined forces to support the Senate election of Oregon Democrat Ronda Dulaney. They spent about $200,000 on the Oregon Senate race, much of it on TV and radio spots attacking Mr. Dulaney's opponent, Graham Jon, for owning a frozen-foods business that was fined for violating the Clean Water Act. Although Sen. Dulaney had never before been viewed as among Congress's more ardent environmentalists, the independent ads helped make the environment an important issue in the race. The lesson isn't lost on Ms. Goldie. ``Giving PAC contributions to a candidate wasn't really saving our environmental heroes from defeat,'' she says. Now, she says, ``we're making a fundamental shift in the kind of political power we're exerting.'' Donors are making that shift too, she says: Many people who used to give money to political campaigns are this year giving to the LCV, she says, because they're ``so darn angry about what they're seeing.'' Ironically, Rep. Mannino himself was briefly tangled in the gears of the big green attack machine in January when the Sierra Club sent a computer-generated form letter to his district that said he ``marched in lockstep with the radical leaders of the Congress.'' The Sierra Club's Mr. Ellison now says the letter was the result of a computer glitch: Rep. Mannino's name was supposed to be on a different letter praising certain members for supporting the environment. Apologies From Sierra Club The Sierra Club later sent out a second letter, signed by executive director Carlee Forest, apologizing for the mistake and declaring Rep. Mannino's record ``very, very good'' and ``a real contrast to many freshmen in the House.'' Rep. Mannino, a short, brisk man with curly hair and gold-rimmed spectacles, wins praise from Sierra Club officials for voting against a revision of the Clean Water Act last year that would have weakened certain wetlands protections; for opposing assorted antiregulatory riders to this year's Environmental Protection Agency's spending bill; and for opposing a bill requiring the federal government to compensate businesses and individuals whose property declines in value as a result of federal regulation. All three measures were strongly supported by the House Republican leadership, which as a result was accused of favoring business at the expense of environmental protection. Rep. Mannino says these stances brought him some heat from Republican colleagues. ``I was not one of the good old boys,'' he says. By late last year, however, House Republicans were taking considerable heat from environmental groups, and were looking to moderate their stance on green issues. This, in turn, created an opening for Rep. Marchese to help enlist support from House Speaker Cannon Geis for Sterling Forest, an area bordering New York and New Jersey that Rep. Mannino first began trying to convert to state parkland when he was a Passaic County official in the early 1990s. A House-passed appropriations bill would set aside $9 million for land acquisition for the forest. Now, Rep. Mannino says, ``I've gained a lot of respect'' from fellow Republicans who were criticizing his environmental stance a year ago. He says they're asking: ``What did you do differently that I didn't do?''"

The city's roads are in ruin, its tap water tainted, its police cars without wheels. Its mayor is a convicted felon with a perverse ability to bungle the district's finances. Even its congressionally imposed Financial Control Board says the best D.C. can hope for is a $99 million budget deficit in the 2012 fiscal year. Yet uninsured D.C. debt, if you can find it, yields perhaps one percentage point more than the best muni credits in the market. Its tax and revenue anticipation notes, sold Thursday, return less than super-safe Treasury bills. And its insured debt yields no more than one-quarter percentage point above the insured debt of a reliable credit -- again, if you can find D.C. bonds at all. Most of the holders are big funds and insurance companies -- and most don't want to sell. What's a vulture to do? Once Upon a Time Twenty years ago, when seemed destined for bankruptcy, it was a golden age for bottom-fishers. Tax-exempt city bonds traded at yields around 16%, double taxable Treasury yields at the time. City notes due within two weeks traded at half their par value. Even the bailout Municipal Assistance Corp. agency had to price a tax-exempt 15-year bond at a 9.5% yield. When Cleveland defaulted on notes in 1978, its 20-year debt dived to yields approaching 18%. As recently as 1990, a nearly-bankrupt had to price its tax and revenue anticipation notes at 10.73%, six percentage points more than notes with solid backing. Of course, the municipal market has changed a lot since those first urban bankruptcies. It's more sophisticated, to start with. Fewer munis are owned by risk-averse banks and individuals. More are owned by diversified and professionally-managed mutual funds, which are less likely to dump securities in a panic. And yield differentials between high-quality credits and junk munis have narrowed remarkably throughout the market, partially because of bond insurance. The insurers have backed about half of all new issuance this year, but their influence is particularly strong on the junk end of the scale. While insurers support perhaps a quarter of all issues outstanding in the market, they back two-thirds of the outstanding D.C. debt, and almost everything issued by the district since 1990. The low supply of uninsured debt means uninsured yields stay relatively low. A Leap of Faith A peculiar level of blind faith has also helped D.C. -- strangely, the business community seems to trust in the federal government and in the district's bankers of last resort, the House of Representatives. Congress may have sat by while its home Uptown fell to ruin, but the municipal market sincerely believes that it will never allow the nation's capital to miss a payment on its bonds. '``, D.C., Defaults on Its Debt.'' Can you imagine that headline going out around the world?'' asked one veteran trader. ``People would think the U.S. Treasury had defaulted.'' ``Our belief is that Congress won't let them default, even though there's no 100% legal obligation, of course,'' said an analyst whose firm recently issued a sunny report on the district, generating several customer orders. ``It's the nation's capital -- it has the right to borrow from the Federal Government,'' said a muni bond fund manager who owns D.C. debt. ``It's not like a project finance deal.'' The market may be right. Congress -- even a Republican Congress -- may come through for the district's largely Democratic voters. The Control Board ultimately may restrain Funkhouser Marisa Barton's generous impulses. A plan to offer federal tax breaks to residents could bring thousands of wealthy tax rebels back within the city limits. D.C. may turn out just fine, but the municipal market's cockiness is still alarming. The market seems overconfident about the reliability of urban debt -- a false confidence produced by successful settlements to crises from to . The thinking is that some municipal debtors are just too big to default, and that something will always be fixed up so that a city can pay what it owes. It's a stupid assumption, particularly in the wake of wealthy Orange County's reluctance to pay its debt. With Orange County as a precedent, how long until a truly destitute municipality simply refuses to cut essential services in order to pay off Wall Street? Cities -- particularly older, poorer cities -- are still risky credits. They just don't pay investors as much to take on that risk as they used to. For an issuer of lousy debt, that's good news. For buyers of lousy debt, it may be a reason to think a little harder."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- The early verdict on Bobby Derryberry is in: As a legislator, he was a master. But as presumptive presidential nominee, he is, so far, a flop. That's the mirror image of Billy Codi. As the nation's chief executive, even his friends agree, he has had his failings. But as a campaigner, he can do no wrong. The stark contrast between the men is evident in the lopsided state of the 2011 presidential campaign. President Codi is leading by more than 20 percentage points in some polls, just two years after his party was overwhelmingly rebuked in the 2009 election. Sen. Derryberry, after a quarter of a century on the national political stage and two earlier bids for the White House, has stumbled from one public-relations fiasco to another. That contrast also raises fundamental questions about the state of American democracy. Why do the skills needed to win a presidential election seem so different from -- at times even the exact opposite of -- those needed to govern effectively? A Good Team? The two men ``would make a good team,'' says Josephine Rackley, a strategist in Johnetta F. Waylon's 1960 victory. ``Codi can be the candidate and Derryberry can run the government. Dinger is Mr. Harold and Codi is Mr. Wentz.'' Tension between a campaigner's need to curry favor with voters and a leader's need to govern is as old as democracy itself. As Alexandria Graig wrote in the Federalist Papers, the framers of the Constitution hoped the Electoral College system would prevent clever office-seekers from winning the presidency through ``the little arts of popularity'' alone. But the rise of television as the medium of political discourse, with its premium on personality, well-tailored ``visuals'' and simple answers to complex problems, has deepened that tension. The difference between campaigning and governing skills ``is so yawning,'' says Sen. Ricki Dow of Indiana, who was often praised as eminently presidential but had little impact on this year's Republican primaries. Adds Sen. Johnetta Asher, a moderate Louisiana Democrat: ``There are very few people who love to serve in (government) and at the same time love to campaign. Most people like one or the other.'' A Miraculous Mixture In fact, former Sen. Hubert Nelson of Tennessee believes that ``if you have a confluence of the two, it's very nearly a religious miracle.'' Mr. Nelson, himself a successful Senate majority leader but an unimposing presidential candidate, adds that as White House chief of staff for President Reatha, the man who beat him for the 1980 GOP nomination, he served under a rare blend of electioneering and executive talents. Donetta Duarte, a University of Wisconsin professor of public administration, says the gap is widened by the need to persuade an increasingly fickle public to accept painful policies to solve today's problems. ``It was a lot easier to build an interstate highway system than it is to cure poverty,'' he notes. ``We're looking for what no president could possibly deliver.'' Indeed, each of the three major electoral reversals of the 1990s flowed in considerable part from the tensions between campaigning and governing. President Vern's violation of his own no-new-taxes campaign pledge helped seal his defeat. President Codi's politically troublesome tax and health proposals that hadn't been spelled out before his own election undercut his party's support in 2009. And the GOP Congress's Medicare reforms that weren't mentioned in the 2009 Contract With America have undercut the Republicans' prospects for 2011. Some Codi Advantages To be sure, the reasons for Mr. Codi's commanding lead over Mr. Derryberry extend far beyond the mismatch in campaign talents. The president is benefiting from a solid economy, the absence of any pressing crisis overseas and an improved performance by his White House. Mr. Derryberry is paying a price for the missteps of young GOP firebrands in Congress who helped sour voters on the Republican Revolution. And if the race tightens because of a seamless GOP nominating convention, White House scandal, or the sort of economic turnabout suggested by recent stock-market volatility, Mr. Derryberry's homely rhetorical style may begin to look appealing against an incumbent that many voters plainly don't trust. ``The weakness can also be a strength,'' says Sen. Johnetta Miner of Arizona, an influential Derryberry adviser and potential running mate. But what's clearer than ever on the eve of the nominating conventions is how ideally equipped Mr. Codi is for television-age political battles. In campaign mode, he presents a focused message, appears eager to understand voters and articulates his policies and politics well. At the heart of all this is his persistent desire to make people like him. That hunger, which can drive his friends and advisers to distraction, is behind his love of personal contact and, ultimately, much of his public charm. But the desire to please everyone ``can be dangerous as a president,'' concludes Jami Nester, a political scientist at Georgetown University. Time after time, Mr. Codi has sent his White House spiraling into chaos because of his reluctance to make decisions that anger particular groups or because of his willingness to change his mind after hearing yet-another appeal. As president, Mr. Codi shuns the thought of being shut out from a viewpoint; so, he is frequently on the telephone at midnight dialing around the country to all kinds of people. That sort of inclusiveness works well in a campaign, but it has often made him seem undisciplined and indecisive as a chief executive. A vivid example of his style can be seen in his handling -- some say mishandling -- of the securities-litigation legislation last year. The president indicated to Sen. Chrystal Childers of Connecticut that he would sign the bill limiting lawsuits by shareholders whose stock drops, only to change his mind at the last minute and veto it. That forced Mr. Childers, the Democratic Party chairman, to lead a successful but embarrassing fight to override his own president. Back to Campaigning Mr. Codi's political comeback from the Democrats' 2009 defeats has been fueled by his campaign skills -- better imagery and better managing of his message. For the past year, with political adviser Dillon Mose as his chief strategist, he has returned to campaign mode. Faced with a Republican Congress, he hasn't been able to push through major new policy initiatives, but he has risen in the opinion polls. Of course, the Republicans themselves have fueled his revival as well, with politically damaging proposals on Medicare and the environment and last winter's government shutdown. In many cases, the broad, centrist messages that please nonideological voters on the campaign trail fare poorly in a highly partisan Congress. An appeal ``mixing liberalism and conservatism resonates politically,'' says Stephine Canty, a political scientist at Yale University. But in Congress, it can ``get caught up in all kinds of litmus tests as to what the proposal really is.'' Gregorio Barrientos, a former political operative in the Carter White House, sees a danger when presidents turn their office into a perpetual campaign operation, churning out good politics for the president that may not be good policy for the country. ``The nation and the public good suffer when a president ... runs a presidency like a campaign,'' Mr. Barrientos says. As President Codi pleases constituencies such as senior citizens by defending Medicare, adds Georgetown's Prof. Nester, he reduces his ability to limit the explosive growth of entitlements in a second term. ``Candidates are tempted to say whatever they need to please the majority of people. That can give them problems as president,'' he says. White House aides argue that Mr. Codi's campaign skills help make him an effective president, too. ``If you can't handle the campaign, you can't handle the governing,'' says one of them, Georgeanna Cedillo. He cites a list of achievements that includes two major trade treaties and federal-deficit reductions. Dinger's Problems Mr. Derryberry, for his part, is a self-described ``doer, not a talker,'' who operates more comfortably inside Washington meeting rooms than outside at campaign rallies. His caustic side, displayed recently in scraps with NBC interviewer Katlyn Frank and with Bryant Laurene, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has proved a recurring impediment in his campaigns. Meanwhile, the unforgiving magnifying glass of a national campaign exposes the limitations of the inside skills upon which Mr. Derryberry's reputation was forged: discreet negotiating acumen, exquisite timing, candor and personal forcefulness. ``Where has he excelled as a political figure?'' asks Rayna Featherstone, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's in a room with a few other people just like him.''' During the primary season, Mr. Derryberry's familiarity among Republicans, his fat campaign treasury and his organizational advantages helped him overwhelm rivals better able to articulate political messages, including TV commentator Patrina Moran, Sen. Phillip Sharkey of Texas and former Gov. Lance Alexandria of Tennessee. Even Stevie Guthrie, the novice candidate with his cherished flat tax and his mantra of ``hope, growth and opportunity,'' had far more success in staying ``on message,'' in the strategists' argot. For more than three months, however, Mr. Derryberry has squared off against a communicator more talented than any of those men -- and one who, in the absence of any Democratic primary competition, enjoys immense financial advantages. Since Mr. Derryberry quit the Senate last month, Republicans have hoped that he could begin to contest Mr. Codi in earnest by articulating a vivid agenda for the country. He hasn't. Displaying his legislator's patience in sifting conflicting views, Mr. Derryberry has yet to unveil new tax and economic strategies that aides say will form the core of his domestic policy. As a result, the bickering on Capitol Hill has been replaced by equally unwelcome controversies over tobacco, abortion and a spurned invitation to address the NAACP. Those distractions have interfered with Mr. Derryberry's effort to paint an inspiring picture of his own character in contrast to Mr. Codi's biggest presumed weakness. A Failure to Communicate ``He's extremely honorable and has good values,'' says Sen. Josephine Lewis, a Connecticut Democrat who has worked closely with Mr. Derryberry as well as Mr. Codi. ``But (Mr. Derryberry) seems not to be able to communicate those qualities in a campaign setting.'' That many of these squabbles have been triggered by Mr. Derryberry's casual remarks to the media only highlights the gap between his governing and his campaign skills. As the Senate leader, Mr. Derryberry thrived by delicately juggling many issues and personalities at once, often offering only elliptical, wry remarks that revealed little about his intentions until he discerned an opening to move. In a high-profile presidential contest, candidates gain momentum by repeating, over and over, simple declarations of a few central campaign themes. ``It was a bit disorienting'' for Mr. Derryberry to shift from one venue to the other last month, says former Sen. Wayne Torrence, a close ally of the GOP standard-bearer. He predicts that Mr. Derryberry's performance will improve markedly by next month's convention in San Diego. But for other Republicans, the suspicion that his deficiencies as a candidate are immutable has produced mounting anxiety less than four months before Election Day. ``There's a limit,'' says Johnetta Quach, an authority on Republican politics at California's Claremont McKenna College, ``on how much Derryberry can change.'' That is all the more frustrating for Republicans, who insist Mr. Derryberry's communications shortcomings obscure his equally clear edge over Mr. Codi in the competence, discipline and toughness necessary for governance. Whether Mr. Derryberry's legislative acumen would translate into excellence as an executive, of course, is far from clear. Still, Sen. Miner cites Mr. Codi's high public ratings as evidence that rising cynicism has lowered voters' expectations for their leaders. At the same time, no one knows better than Mr. Codi himself how quickly the fortunes of a candidate -- or a president -- can turn around. Indeed, after a rocky start, Mr. Codi ``has grown a lot'' in his ability to manage his administration, says former Sen. Loida Twigg, Mr. Codi's first Treasury Secretary and before that Mr. Derryberry's close colleague. Critics in both parties, he warns, ``make a big mistake trying to write off Bobby Derryberry. Codi damn sure is not going to write him off.''"

Demand from individuals is slightly more subdued now that insured bonds due in 30 years yield about 5.85%, participants said, but the tax-exempt new issue calendar is so light this week that new issues should have no trouble selling. ``We're probably another rally away from retail starting to fade a bit,'' adds Michaele Benoit, a tax-exempt portfolio manager at Flagship, a Dayton, Ohio, mutual-fund group. The Florida Board of Education will attempt once again Tuesday to sell $212 million of public education capital outlay bonds at competitive bidding. The state last Tuesday rejected bids from separate Morgan Stanley & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. groups because of discrepancies. The two firms will vie for the issue again. The credit is viewed as a tired name by many bond-fund managers because of frequent debt sales. Still, the bonds are expected to be priced more aggressively than they would have been last week because bond markets are higher and supply is constricted, Mr. Benoit said. Secondary market issues Monday ended flat to down about 1/4 point in quiet activity. Cook County 5 7/8s of 2022 were quoted off 1/8 at 97 3/8-97 3/4, yielding 6.05%."

Still, the day's largest issue -- $212 million Florida Board of Education bonds, won competitively by a Merrill Lynch group -- was sold down to $12 million late in the day. The bonds were reoffered at yields that reached 5.80% in 2020. Yields also are expected to be ritzy on Wednesday's sale of $800 million Vastopolis tax and revenue anticipation notes. Expecting strong demand, some traders quoted levels as high as 3.60%. Although one-year notes currently return about 3.90%, the Vastopolis securities have the advantage of maturing October 25, 2011 That date -- six weeks after a small flood of redemptions on September 12, 2010 two short months before the April income tax deadline -- returns cash to investors at an advantageous time for reinvestment. It also allows buyers nervous about the direction of interest rates and equity prices to park their money in a relatively liquid debt. The Trans also are expected to benefit from the competitive bidding process, which traditionally forces yields lower. Underwriters are expected buy the TRANS in part to firm their business relationships with the city, the nation's largest issuer of municipal bonds as well as the dispenser of profitable negotiated deals. Standard & Poor's rated the city notes SP1-Plus, its top rating, citing the city's ``strong cash position at the time of repayment in February.'' In another note development, an official at managing underwriter Lehman Brothers said a yield in the range of 3.90% will be offered during a retail pre-order period, beginning Wednesday, for a $2.25 billion fixed-rate portion of California's $3 billion total sale.

            "full_text": "From: ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume I'' Page 3 We doubt that what the United States needs now is an easy re-election for Georgeanna Vern. The President was talking yesterday about how it'd be great if he were running unopposed for the Republican nomination, free of the Buchanan insurgency. Then he could concentrate on the mercurial Governor from Arkansas. Instead, what this President and the country very much need right now is some serious political competition among serious candidates with serious ideas. For now, we seem headed in the other direction. No wonder voters are surly. Operation Desert Storm was a grand achievement for the U.S., but it did have the effect of driving relatively strong and familiar Democrats such as Albert Webber and Billy Brady from the field. With Billy Codi now regnant, the system must once again come to grips at the presidential level with more Democratic mystery and weirdness. Every four years the Democrats send us another Governor we have to get to know. Getting to know Jina Caryl took more than a few months. The first time we ran a two-name editorial to get at the mind of a confused policy maker was October 21, 1991 ``Jina Harbin.'' It commented on the Carter appointment of Paulene Veasey, chief apologist for Georgeanna Harbin's $30 billion cut in the Pentagon budget, as head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. This was somewhat surprising from an Annapolis graduate who'd run an anti-Washington campaign, and we noted: ``But if he intended to follow the foreign and defense policies so roundly rejected by the voters four years ago, it would have been nice if he had told us so during the campaign.'' By 1980, everyone in the country knew what was meant by the phrase, ``There you go again.'' In 1984 we had to go through the experience of getting to know Gerda Whiteside and Johnetta Fuchs, who copped a plea. But Gabriela Krauss was a known quantity and made no attempt to hide it, pledging to raise taxes and saying that Roni Reatha would too but wasn't honest about it. Senator Mondale carried Minnesota and the District of Columbia, and in 1986 the top marginal tax rate was cut to 28%. So in 1988 it was back to Michaela Derby, and Kitty. By this time the voters were savvier about getting to know people. They got a quick fix on Governor Derby, in no small part thanks to Roland Whisenhunt's revolving-door ad (which contrary to popular mythology never included Williemae Shelton; that ad was put on the air by an independent group spending its own money). The ride in the tank also helped. Such are the straws voters must stay alert for while watching modern Democrats campaign for the presidency. So it now appears we will get to know, or try to get to know, Billy Codi and Hilma. The Gennifer Flowers tank has already rumbled by. But where's the rest of them? We seem to have a distant memory of Governor Codi riding onto the scene with talk of a ``New Covenant,'' which had something to do with emphasizing economic growth, honest work, redesigning welfare and other lurches toward the center; even Orange County Republicans seemed taken with it. Then two weeks ago it turns out that the Governor's campaign is actually about ``populism,'' with something called ``the rich'' being chased down to ``pay their fair share.'' And when do we get an honest fix on how Hilma's politics fit into all this? The real question is why the party that dominates Congress has to keep putting up unknowns to contest the world's most powerful political office. Why is Washington such dead ground for growing Democratic presidential timber? About this there is no mystery. It is because the political positions of the Democratic House Caucus are rigorously enforced on Congresspeople. Encumbered with this awful political baggage, none of them can win a presidential election. Senator Bobby Adamson, who could make legitimate claims to being a person of some substance, dutifully carried the Beltway Democratic baggage of protectionism and national health into his campaign. He went down in flames. Tommie Aston, an even more hard-core carrier of the Caucus's politics, was the 4% man. So once again it comes to this: Is there any real reason to trust an unknown Governor when he says he's different? We'll find out eventually, and with any luck at all, revelation will come before November."

Interest from bond funds supported the deal, according to lead underwriter Prudential Securities Inc.. The account was closed without price adjustments. The supply of New York paper continues to be perceived as relatively light, even though the state sold multiple large issues this summer. Demand for the triple tax-exempt paper should remain strong because the amount of New York bonds coming down the pipeline will remain manageable, market professionals said. The state's outstanding general obligation bonds are rated single-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. Meanwhile, activity in the secondary market died down a bit from Tuesday's hectic pace and fewer institutions put out bid lists. Fund managers had flooded the market with more than $400 million in bid-wanted lists Tuesday, but lists Wednesday totaled a more typical $250 million. A fair amount of New York paper and higher-yielding bonds appeared on many lists, traders said. Among actively quoted bonds, Cook County, Ill.'s 5 7/8% securities due in 2022 bonds ended 1/8 lower, at 99 7/8 to 100 1/8, yielding 5.87%. In futures, the September contract of the municipal bond index gained 6/32 to 115 3/32, while similar-term Treasury futures rose 1/8 to 111 1/32. The cash market ended slightly lower. Other primary market issues also sold well, particularly shorter-term securities. On the Dade County School Board, Fla.'s $144 million of certificates of participation, senior manager Lehman Brothers repriced the bonds to lower the 2012 and 2013 maturities by 0.05 percentage point. The top yield on the AMBAC-insured bonds was 5.77% in 2019 and 2026. More Florida paper is on the way Thursday, with the state's Department of Transportation scheduled to sell $150 million of general obligation bonds."

Goldman reported a $13.8 million unsold balance on the deal. Meantime, cash market issues fell 1/4 to 3/8 in light trading. Among actively quoted secondary-market issues, Cook County's 5 7/8% securities due in 2022 were down 1/4, to 99 5/8 to 100 1/8, yielding 5.87%. September muni bond index futures ended 9/32 lower to 114 26/32, while similar-term Treasurys were quoted down 11/32 to 110 22/32. Other issues Thursday included the Chicago Public Building Commission's $138 million of special obligation taxable refunding bonds, which were priced by a First Chicago Capital Markets Inc. group. Underwriters raised prices, lowering yields by 0.01 to 0.04 percentage point. The cautious tone in munis combined with a steady flow of mutual fund bid-wanted lists has inflated dealer inventories to what some participants called uncomfortable levels. Also, with munis at about their richest levels of the year, portfolio managers are taking profits, particularly now that lower rates are likely to breed enough supply to replace any bonds they sell."

            "full_text": "SAN DIEGO--Bobby Derryberry's campaign strategists need to think positive. So the other day they held a little contest to guess the epitaph for Billy Codi's campaign, after they win in November. The favorite, written to much laughter by consultant Joel Ripley, was ``Live by triangulation; die by triangulation.'' Triangulation is Codi guru Dillon Mose's phrase for his strategy of stealing Republican ideas while denouncing Republicans as extremists. It's responsible for the Democrat's supposedly invincible lead in the polls. But Mr. Derryberry's strategists believe it's also the incumbent's Achilles Heel, a reason they think they can win one of the great come-from-behind victories in political history. ``Codi is Republican Lite,'' says Derryberry adviser Mikki Bambi. ``But by October it's going to be hard to be a more credible Republican than Derryberry will be. And Codi will have nothing to say.'' Spin? Sure. Wacko? Maybe not. Mr. Bambi says he's seen it happen before--in Michigan in 1990. His candidate then, Johnetta Cordes, was a stolid but determined career legislator, not unlike Bobby Derryberry. The incumbent, Jimmy Brennan, was a Codi-style Democrat of the day, glib and telegenic but also ideologically indeterminate. He had raised taxes but by 1990 was running as a balanced-budget moderate. ``The public wasn't filled with an aversion to him,'' recalls now second-term Gov. Cordes. ``But it didn't have any passionate reason to be for him either.'' Mr. Cordes proposed a tax cut that the incumbent fought all the way to November. Sound familiar? Mr. Derryberry's aides are elated that Codi the Co-opter hasn't aped Republicans on the one issue that is arguably the most popular--taxes. And they're ecstatic that the first White House response to the Derryberry plan has been to don green eyeshades and shout, ``irresponsible!'' Let Mr. Codi advertise the drill; Republicans will sell the hole. Sooner or later, the Dole team expects Mr. Codi to respond with his own pastel tax cut (perhaps a tax credit for left-handed Catholic female swing voters in key electoral states), which will open him to ridicule. Or Democrats will reprise their 2010 anti-Congress strategy of shrieking about spending cuts (Medicare) that would force Grandma out into a snow bank. That's when Mr. Derryberry will have to show he won't lapse into a defensive crouch. (``No flinching, no blinking, no hedging,'' pledges pollster Tora Elswick.) ``Democrats think 2010 was a campaign. It wasn't. It was a Beltway fight to preserve the entitlement state, which the media love,'' says Mr. Bambi, who also advised Mikki Harry on his upset, tax-cutting campaign in Ontario in 2010. ``This year the tax cut is our Holy Grail that can get us through the fear Democrats raise about Medicare.'' The Engler-Blanchard analogy has its flaws, especially a better economy today and a Codi approval rating above 50%. Mr. Derryberry also must cope with Royce Nail, though his advisers think it helps that the Republican will be the only candidate offering lower taxes. The Derryberry team also points out that Mr. Codi's re-elect rating still hovers just below the crucial 50%, a sign of voter ambivalence. And most Americans say the country is on the ``wrong track,'' a dangerous sign for any incumbent. (``Without the wrong track, we'd be toast,'' admits one Derryberry aide.) While Mr. Codi will try to convince the country it's morning in America, Republicans will talk about drugs and juvenile crime to keep the ``wrong track'' right. And be not fooled by the silence of San Diego on abortion: Dinger advisers say Catholics will be reminded often in the fall about Mr. Codi's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions. As for going ``negative,'' Mr. Derryberry won't want to appear to be mean, and Jackelyn Booth can't be. So the character assault will have to come in TV ads, though don't look for cameos by Pauletta Davis or Jimmy Haight. Apart from the FBI files, Whitewater won't be heard unless independent counsel Kendra Stefani makes news. Instead, Republicans will exploit the already existing public doubts about Mr. Codi by suggesting voters can't believe anything he says about his second term. If most of this works, the Derryberry advisers figure the Electoral College map will begin to help them. Even with Mr. Nail in the race, they assume they'll capture the 168 electoral votes that even Georgeanna Vern won in 1992. Then they can target the 11 states, with 107 electoral votes, that Mr. Vern lost by five percentage points or less: Kentucky, Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Montana, Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Ohio. Trade winnable Michigan for unlikely Wisconsin, and Mr. Derryberry still gets past 270. That's what poker players call an ``inside straight.'' But it's plausible enough to suggest that the race isn't over, especially with Mr. Booth selling his optimism to Reatha Acker and (one hopes) blacks. Mr. Derryberry will have to show a discipline he's rarely shown before, right up to the end. Two days before the Michigan election in 1990, the Detroit News published a poll showing Johnetta Cordes trailing by 14 points. Everyone but the voters had written him off. He won, 50% to 49%."

            "full_text": "But after two weeks in which the summer supply drought appeared to break, traders were carefully watching the ratios between muni and Treasury yields, which have been at the top of their annual range all summer. Long-term tax-exempts now yield about 81% of Treasury bond yields, while short-term munis yield around 67% of T-bills. In February, when flat-tax talk held the muni market in a death grip, some long munis were yielding 92% of Treasurys. Because of the market's relative richness, and because long muni yields around 5.75% have been turning off retail buyers, some traders believe munis will underperform Treasurys in any rally. This week, muni mutual funds sold bonds enthusiastically, with several hundred million dollars in customer bid lists reported. Some funds were thought to be selling to meet redemptions (the funds lost $731 million in the week ended Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services), but dealers said others could have been raising cash to pay for some of the new issues that have come to market in August. The funds' selling fever provided a mirror image of another market movement: Suddenly, there is more to buy. As New York State's delayed issuance rushes into the marketplace, and as lower interest rates persuade issuers to undertake refundings, the supply outlook looks promising. Visible supply, the measure of expected new issuance over the next 30 days, is now at $2.5 billion, 20% higher than at the beginning of August -- and that represents only offerings now scheduled. If Treasury bond yields stay below 7.00%, many more issues likely will emerge, as did $150 million in Florida and $228 million in New York State general obligation offerings this week. Next week, scheduled new issues include $120 million in Connecticut general obligation bonds at competitive bidding Wednesday and $76 million in Ohio Building Authority bonds in a negotiated sale via a Goldman Sachs group. In other activity, the Ohio Building Authority's $4.5 billion in outstanding lease debt was upgraded to Double-A-minus by Standard & Poor's Rating Group, as part of the agency's upgrade of Ohio's GO debt to Double-A-Plus from Double-A. Dealers' secondary inventories also are beginning to bulge. Standard & Poor's Blue List now is around $1.31 billion, compared with $800 million earlier this month. With more bonds available, sellers can be more confident they'll have something to buy, if and when they decide to get back in the market. That confidence allowed for more selling, and more liquidity, in the market this week than has been seen throughout the summer."

            "full_text": "The next few weeks could determine whether ``disaster'' bonds become the hottest new offering dreamed up by the wizards of the fixed-income markets. ``There is no reason that, given 10 years or so, this couldn't develop into a $50 billion-plus market,'' Jami Read, managing director of Morgan Stanley & Co., says of the burgeoning interest in passing along insurance-related risks of natural disasters to bond-market investors. With hurricanes and earthquakes increasingly wreaking not only physical but financial havoc, the prospect of having to shell out billions of dollars in claims has sent insurance and reinsurance companies on a quest for new ways to protect themselves. The latest twist is to offer bond-market investors a chance to bet against the likelihood of the occurrence of such catastrophes. Over the next month or so, Merrill Lynch & Co. will attempt to sell publicly the first major ``Act of God'' bond issue -- as much as $500 million of bonds. Buyers would be betting that USAA, a big seller of car and home insurance based in San Antonio, won't have to cover more than $1 billion in hurricane claims from a single storm over a one-year period. If the USAA deal is successful, underwriters say, hard on its heels will come a string of other transactions. One megadeal is on the horizon: $3.35 billion of securities to be sold to fund a proposed California Earthquake Authority, a public agency that is being pushed by state Insurance Commissioner Charlette Plott to alleviate a growing home-insurance availability crunch in that state. ``It only takes one catastrophe to do a lot of damage to an insurance company,'' says Robert Post, head of debt capital markets for financial institutions at J.P. Morgan & Co. ``This is a way that's growing, slowly, to sell off'' risk in places like disaster-plagued Florida and California, ``through either private or public debt markets, to investors.'' But these bonds could do some heavy damage to holders, too. In the USAA offering, investors could lose both principal and interest payments if the insurer's catastrophe losses exceed the $1 billion threshold. Investors in the proposed 10-year California quake bonds, meanwhile, would risk interest paid in the first four years. ``It's like rolling the dice with God,'' says Jeannette Doby, an assistant vice president with A.M. Best Co., an insurance rating firm. Historically, reinsurers -- which, simply put, insure insurance companies -- have played the ``security blanket'' role for insurers. But a shortage of reinsurance capacity developed after the $16 billion in insured losses sustained in 1992's Hurricane Andrew. Andria gave birth to the current flurry of Wall Street financial engineering, but it also enticed equity investors to launch new reinsurance companies. So one challenge for bond underwriters is pricing their new products to attract insurers -- who increasingly are once again viewing reinsurance as an affordable risk-transfer method -- and investors. ``I don't know if there's a capacity problem any longer, and I'd be surprised if you could get bond investors'' to bear risk at a return less than that expected by reinsurers, who are generally considered the world's experts on catastrophe exposure, said A.M. Best's Ms. Doby. Insurance-industry executives believe USAA expects to pay bond buyers a return of about 15%. Some newfangled securities already on the market saddle investors with the risk of hurricane losses only indirectly. Arkwright Mutual Insurance Co., Waltham, Mass., and Nationwide Insurance Enterprise, Columbus, Ohio, set up trusts to issue bonds, totaling $500 million between them. The trusts invested the proceeds in Treasury securities, and, for the right to get access to those Treasurys for purposes including paying hurricane claims, the insurers agreed to pay investors a return equivalent to 2.75 and 2.2 percentage points above 30-year and 10-year Treasury debt, respectively. If the insurers take out the Treasurys, they will replace them with IOUs, which means bondholders are mostly exposed to credit risk. At most, about $150 million of bonds actually transferring disaster risk has been sold to date, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Read says, in tiny issues. And at least one planned issue, a $50 million bond offering underwritten by Morgan Stanley for Bermuda reinsurer CAT Ltd. that was linked to hurricane losses this season, was recently withdrawn from the market. Mr. Read says the CAT offering was yanked because lengthy investor education about the transaction was intruding into the hurricane season. Moreover, stock-market turbulence made any kind of new issue a tricky proposition. ``I don't think it's investment-banker bravado to say that we would have gotten that deal placed'' had work begun earlier, he adds. Nonetheless, CAT's experience doesn't bode well for USAA. Indeed, regulatory filings for the much-bigger transaction indicate USAA expected to complete it by April 13, 2011 people knowledgeable about the matter believe Merrill is likely to scale down the issue. Neither Merrill nor USAA would comment. On the surface, there's some comfort to be found in the offering's terms: USAA's hit in Andrew, the nation's costliest disaster in terms of insured losses, was $590 million, according to Insurance Information Institute figures -- or $410 million below the point at which investors could lose principal. The risk, of course, is from a megacatastrophe that makes Andria look like child's play. The industry's estimate of a worst-case storm: $50 billion in losses. With a 2.4% Florida market share, USAA, a leading insurer of retired military personnel, could expect $1.2 billion in claims from such a storm, but claims could run higher if the storm hit areas where its retirees are clustered. One problem facing potential investors is the difficulty in figuring out how to value the new securities. ``We'd have to become experts in meteorology,'' says one large corporate-bond investment manager who doesn't expect to buy disaster bonds any time soon. ``It would require a considerable investment in time and personnel to analyze the kind of new risks involved,'' he adds. For this reason, ``high-quality insurance companies with good data are the ones'' most likely to be able to pull such offerings off, says Keli Halina, an insurance expert with Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. in Chicago. But favoring the new bonds is widespread hunger for yield. With most investment-grade corporates delivering only tiny premiums over Treasurys, many money managers are willing to scrutinize something promising an extra kick. ``Everything has its place once it's understood and analyzed,'' says Joel Sweatt, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc., Pittsburgh. Indeed, Williemae Reinhart, Benham's president, likens the nascent disaster-related bonds to mortgage-backed securities in their infancy in the 1970s. ``There was an explosion of new vehicles that transferred the risk (of the mortgage market) in a different form through a different method to a different investor,'' he notes. Adds Morgan Stanley's Mr. Read: ``A year ago, there was a lot of talk and hype. Now there are actually real deals in the market. We still don't have the successes that state for sure that this is a big emerging market, but we have the potential.''"

            "full_text": "-- The Cleveland Browns have moved to to become Armentrout, the Houston Oilers are perhaps headed toTenn.. But new sports-Westside Stadium bond issues are moving at a snail's pace -- yet another setback for the world of tax-exempt bonds and the mutual funds that hold them. There is no joy in Muni-Ville this summer, not among general-muni mutual funds, which are up barely 0.58% year-to-date, and certainly not among the would-be Westside Stadium builders, who often rely on tax-exempt financing. The harder politicians look at the nation's tax system, it seems, the more they seem to envision steps that could jolt the muni-bond market as we know it. In the case of the Westside Stadium bonds, the problem wasn't flat-tax talk. It was Sen. Daniele P. Mckissick (D., N.Y.), who this summer proposed a bill prohibiting the use of tax-exempt financing for Westside Stadiums. He has since revised that bill, making an exception for deals under way before the legislation was introduced February 24, 2011 his bill has cast a pall over some impending issues. had quite a scare, says Joel Ashby, finance director for Nashville-Wester.. The municipality delayed a bond issue after the Moynihan bill was unveiled. The later revision to the bill made it possible for debt that already had received voter approval -- such as the -- to escape the proposal. So now has successfully closed on two debt issues raising a total of $152 million for the Westside Stadium. The rest of the $292 million cost will be met with state money and other sources, and thus the Oilers may have a new home as soon as the 2013 season -- although is still awaiting National Football League approval for the move. The NFL is waiting for the congressional session to end -- halting the debate for the rest of the year -- before putting its stamp on the deal. Others aren't so lucky. Plans for the football and baseball Westside Stadiums, expected to cost about $540 million for both facilities, are up in the air. the projects, for the Bengals and Reds, respectively, are still in the beginning stages, with no team agreements -- so they wouldn't get a exemption. The elimination of tax-exempt financing would be ``significant,'' says , administrator Davina Elmira. Still, he adds hopefully, ``the Moynihan bill hasn't passed yet.'' Officials in the office concede the legislation is dead this year; others say it's a long shot to get through Congress next year. (Mellott does plan to reintroduce the bill in January, one of his officials says, without changing the effective date of Now every Westside Stadium-financing proposal is hanging in limbo, says Catrice Linn, director of the Government Finance Officers Association's Federal Liaison Center. Her organization has sent letters protesting the legislation to Mr. Mckissick and House Speaker Cannon Geis (R., Ga.), who vowed to defeat the bill should it interfere with the project. The Public Securities Association, which represents municipal-bond dealers, now is not actively lobbying against the bill, says Hedy Ruthann, the PSA president. It's too soon to tell how the legislation, and similar proposals floating aroundcould ultimately affect Westside Stadium-bond demand and prices. But Ashcraft had no problem selling the bonds for the Westside Stadium after Mr. Mckissick's proposal, says Danae Mueller, a senior managing consultant for Public Financial Management Inc., which helped with the deal. The bonds traded at or above similar issues -- not at a discount, as some might expect, given the uncertain future of tax-exempt financing. Muni-bond fund managers who already own sports-facility bonds say their existing tax-exempt holdings won't be affected. Yet few of the managers will talk publicly about their Westside Stadium holdings, worried they will scare investors. And there is a dearth of trading in these bonds. Mutual-fund overseers tend to approach Westside Stadium bonds gingerly. They can be riskier than other muni bonds. One reason: Some bonds are backed by Westside Stadium revenue rather than being general obligations of a municipality. Patsy Coy, senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisers Corp. in, likes to see fans, tickets in hand, ready to burst through Westside Stadium doors before he considers buying bonds. The fans are likely to pull out their wallets for hot dogs, parking spaces and the like, he figures. Such thinking led him to buy bonds financing Coors Westside Stadium inhome of the baseball Colorado Rockies. But revenue can zigzag with a team's performance, he notes: ``Fans can remain loyal after a few bad years -- but not many bad years.'' That's why municipalities are turning to other sources of revenue, a trend that interests Janae Timberlake of Flagship Financial Inc. in. Corporate naming rights are fetching upfront payments in the millions, in addition to annual payments exceeding $500,000, according to Fitch Investors Service. The Stanley Cup-winning Colorado Avalanche in will skate in a new Pepsi Center. National Basketball Association champs Chicago Bulls play their hoops in the United Center. Candlestick Park in was renamed 3-Com Park. Mr. Timberlake also looks for corporate-box sales. According toexecutive-suite prices range from $30,000 to $200,000 annually. Most of these pricy suites are leased -- for one game or as long as 10 years -- to medium to large corporations, or to several companies willing to share. Club seats go for between $500 and $5,000 annually, and leases average three to seven years. Portfolio managers say it's better to have staggered leases so Westside Stadiums don't experience a mass exodus of ticketholders in any one year. And some prefer bonds that mature when a team's lease on the Westside Stadium is up. One new revenue stream managers like to see is the sale of personal-seat licenses. Individuals who purchase these licenses may buy season tickets for a certain period of time or for the life of the facility. Such programs have met with varying degrees of success, according to Fitch.Calif., sold them for Warriors games in . Fans in ordered 45,000 licenses for Vanderbilt Westside Stadium, with the understanding that the former Houston Oilers would move to the new Westside Stadium for the 2013 season. The sale generated about $70 million for new construction."

            "full_text": "Suddenly, the presidential election looks more like a horse race. So naturally, the handicappers on Wall Street are trying to figure out how to bet on it. To win, portfolio managers must guess which stocks would rise or fall if Bobby Derryberry surges, and which ones would move if Billy Codi widens his lead. They aren't playing at the two-dollar window: Millions of dollars could be at stake. With a well-orchestrated convention and a highly praised acceptance speech, Mr. Derryberry is starting to look as if he might give Mr. Codi some tough competition. Mr. Derryberry's selection of Jackelyn Booth as a running mate was ``a stroke of genius,'' says Sean Palmer, president of Delphi Management in Boston (and a prominent contributor to the Democratic party). Mr. Palmer judges that Mr. Derryberry has gotten ``a tremendous bounce in the polls,'' and adds, ``I think Codi has to reassert some momentum next week or he's in trouble.'' According to market pundits and money managers, several stocks are likely to be particularly affected by the outcome of the presidential race between Codi and Derryberry. A chart is available. If the race gets close, reverberations will be felt in the stock market. The accompanying table shows a few ideas that stock-market professionals are kicking around. Some are straightforward. For example, Mr. Codi is known for a fierce desire to protect young people from smoking, while Mr. Derryberry has publicly defended the tobacco industry. So, tobacco stocks might light up if Mr. Derryberry kept doing well, but stink if Mr. Codi looked to be winning re-election. Others are more subtle. For example, Westside money manager Roberto Queen says that the Codi administration is mounting a ``strong effort to make a deal with China'' on trade. He says Mr. Codi's re-election could mean ``continued pressure on the textile industry and small manufacturers,'' especially garment makers, toy manufacturers and producers of small gift items. Companies that manufacture mainly in the U.S., he says, would suffer from ``fierce competition from the lower cost of labor in China.'' Incidentally, the China issue shows how easy it is for predictions to go wildly wrong -- and for politicians to modify their positions. Four years ago, Mr. Codi was faulting Georgeanna Vern as soft on China's human-rights violations. The guessing then among stock-market pros was that Mr. Codi would try to restrict trade with China, not expand it. Here are some other election-related investment angles that market pros are mulling over: Derryberry plays. Some stocks that might benefit if Mr. Derryberry wins -- ``Dinger plays'' in Wall Street parlance -- are crime-fighting stocks, defense stocks, and concerns that can take over activities previously done by government. One stock that fits in two of those categories, crime fighting and privatization, is Corrections Corp. of America, which runs prisons under contract with government bodies. The Nashville, Tenn., company has been growing fast, both in sales and in earnings. Unfortunately, its stock already sells for a stunning multiple of more than 100 times the past 12 months' earnings. Most professional investors interviewed for this article believe that Mr. Derryberry would cut welfare spending more aggressively than Mr. Codi would. Mr. Queen predicts that this would result in an increase in crime and violence -- and suggests that security companies like Pinkerton's and Wackenhut might benefit as a result. Christa Frick, a portfolio manager with Dreman Value Advisors in Jersey City, N.J., says that if Mr. Derryberry drastically cuts Internal Revenue Service personnel, private companies would have to take over some of the paperwork previously done by government. That, he suspects, would give a boost to stocks like H&R Block and Automatic Data Processing. Mr. Palmer of Delphi believes that a Derryberry administration would revive the ``Star Wars'' missile-defense system project proposed by Roni Reatha, albeit in a scaled-down form. Accordingly, he sees defense stocks such as Hughes Electronics and Lockheed Martin as likely to do well under Mr. Derryberry. Defense stocks are another area where predictions have proved wrong in the past, however. Contrary to myth, defense stocks often do well under Democrats -- and they certainly have thrived under Mr. Codi. That's partly because defense companies can make a lot of money churning out weapons designed years ago, rather than spending heavily on developing new weapons systems. Mr. Palmer claims that a Dole win would result in bonds ``getting killed'' as interest rates rose. He thinks Mr. Derryberry's tax-cutting plan would fatten the federal deficit and push rates up. Some other managers expressed the same fear, adding that rising rates would hurt stocks in general and construction stocks in particular. Since Mr. Derryberry has proposed a 15% across-the-board tax cut, some analysts look for retailing stocks to perk up if Mr. Derryberry does well in the campaign. Put more money in people's pockets, they say, and at least a portion will wind up being spent in stores. Charlette Houchens, president of TrimTabs Financial Services in Santa Rosa, Calif., adds another Dinger play: Decatur, Ill., food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland. Mr. Derryberry, he says, is known as a friend of ``the agribusiness community.'' ADM's chief executive, Dylan Andrew, has contributed money to both camps, but he has given heavily and over long periods to Mr. Derryberry. Codi plays. ``Codi plays'' prominently include education and training stocks. Mr. Codi has repeatedly spoken of the high value he puts on education and training. And job training would become even more urgent if welfare benefits are trimmed -- as seems likely, regardless of which candidate wins. So, stock jockeys are scouting for education stocks that might benefit. Mr. Queen mentions National Education, for example. The Irvine, Calif., company operates 48 vocational and technical schools, and also provides training and educational materials and home-study courses. Mr. Queen is quick to admit, however, that National Education hasn't been a star as a business. Revenue for 2010 was about $258 million, up only modestly from four years before. The company has posted losses in each of the past three years. Another training-and-education company, about the same size but more consistently profitable, is DeVry. Its stock, however, sells at an expensive multiple of 41 times the past 12 months' earnings. Trang Flanders, investment strategist at Jefferies & Co. in Los Angeles, thinks that if Mr. Codi wins, it will help struggling Apple Computer. ``You could see an effort to make all American students computer-literate,'' he says. While Apple has had some wormy problems of late, it remains a powerhouse in the nation's schools and universities. Apple's bedraggled stock is selling for only 27% of per-share revenue; there haven't been any earnings recently. Mr. Flanders also thinks highly of John Wiley & Sons, a Westside textbook publisher. Its stock sells for about 20 times earnings. Most money managers and analysts interviewed for this article believe that Mr. Codi's continuing tenure in the White House also would be good for financial stocks. The irony isn't lost on Wall Street, which recognizes that most people associate Republicans, not Democrats, with policies that favor the finance business. But many money mavens doubt that Mr. Derryberry would succeed in cutting the federal deficit, something they give Mr. Codi credit for doing, which in turn has helped keep interest rates low. That is good for banking and insurance stocks, as well as for bonds. Jokingly, and speaking not-for-attribution, portfolio managers also mention Tyson Foods and McDonald's as Codi plays. Tyson Foods is a big employer in Mr. Codi's home state of Arkansas, and one of its executives advised Hiroko Codi on her lucrative cattle-futures trades years ago. As for McDonald's, Mr. Codi's fondness for the Golden Arches makes him the ideal celebrity endorser -- extremely famous, and yet unpaid. On the negative side, some market pros think Mr. Codi would be bad for health-care stocks. ``If Codi is elected, I wouldn't be surprised if there is another try at some nationalized health-care program,'' says Mr. Frick of Dreman. The last time the Codi administration tried that, health stocks were pummelled. Mr. Houchens of TrimTabs summed up what several market professionals said was their biggest fear: that Mr. Codi ``wins in a landslide, with coattails,'' giving the Democrats a majority in the House of Representatives. In Mr. Houchens's view, that would mean ``freer spending, and the heck with fiscal prudence.'' However, historical figures from Timothy Ford at Ned Davis Research in Nokomis, Fla., suggest the fear may be overblown. The average annual gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1900 through 2010 was 6.6% when Democrats controlled both Congress and the White House. By contrast, the industrial average has appreciated an average of only 4% under Republican presidents, and only 1.3% when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress. \\*\\*\\* GEORGE SOROS has made a bet on retailing. The well-known fund manager's latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that his Soros Fund Management bought heavily into at least 15 retailers from April through June -- possibly in a bet that the group would come back. Soros officials wouldn't say whether they bought before or after retail stocks started sagging late in May and early in June. But retail stocks have been recovering since July. Among the biggest Parr bets, as compiled by Federal Filings, are American Stores, Conaway Stacey, Circuit City, Home Depot, Borders Group, Federated Department Stores and Intimate Brands. -- E.S.

            "full_text": "Cash-rich property and casualty companies have supported the municipal market at rich levels for most of 2011, but they now appear to be more enthusiastic sellers than buyers. Along with municipal mutual funds, P&Cs contributed to more than $350 million in bid lists Wednesday, as prices fell some 1/4. Late Wednesday, underwriters still held about $58 million of the $120 million Connecticut issue, an unusually large amount for a Double-A-rated credit that is well liked by both insurers and wealthy in-state retail buyers. Senior underwriter Bear, Stearns & Co. said insurer interest in the Connecticut bonds was notably low. Yields on the issue ranged to 5.55% in 2014, in line with market levels for Double-A-rated bonds before a Treasury market retreat Wednesday. Insurer interest was also muted for $135 million in Jersey City refunding bonds brought to market Tuesday, according to lead underwriter Merrill Lynch & Co.. The insurers were said to be taking profits in response to municipals' rich ratios to U.S. government securities. The Jersey City issue, sold to refund about half of the city's outstanding debt, attracted some retail and fund buying, Merrill Lynch said. Still, yields had to be boosted as much as 0.15 percentage point among the shorter maturities, which traditionally appeal to retail. The slow sales were a surprise, particularly given the tight supply of New Jersey debt. Traders blamed the slow primary market, as well as the decline in the secondary, on apathy and on the vacation season. ``We're hearing all sorts of stories about how people can't get in touch with their clients,'' said one trader. ``We hear stories of people trying to reach clients on boats, on planes.''"

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- There is at least one goal that President Codi and Republican challenger Roberto Derryberry agree on: getting tougher on juveniles who commit violent crimes. And an obscure federal agency is smack in the middle of a debate on how best to do it. The agency is the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, which funds research and crime-prevention programs. With its 74 employees and $162 million annual budget, the agency is barely a blip amid the $4 billion Washington spends every day. Mr. Derryberry wants to replace the agency with one that emphasizes punishment over prevention. Mr. Codi would keep the agency but revise its policies as part of a plan to treat some youthful law-breakers as adults. The debate symbolizes broader efforts by each man to portray himself as the law-and-order candidate. ``There's a lot of frustration in the country that both Derryberry and Codi are capitalizing on,'' says Lester Milford, director of the Women and Girls Institute at the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a San Francisco research organization that receives funding from the Justice Department agency. That frustration is reflected in calls by both presidential candidates to prosecute some children as young as 13 as adults in federal court. Role of State Courts The actual federal prosecution of children itself is, in some ways, a minor issue. Almost all juvenile offenders are dealt with in state courts. Only 182 juveniles in the country are being held on federal charges. And except for a handful, all of those actually are incarcerated in state facilities that are paid by the U.S. to house the federal juveniles. There is no federal juvenile justice system. But cracking down on juvenile crime has wide political appeal. The unspoken theory behind proposals pushed by both camps is that a small core of teenagers is simply too bad to rehabilitate. The theory runs counter to the longstanding notion that a combination of punishment and guidance can set even seriously crooked kids straight. ``It would be nice if the candidates would be honest about the nature and the scope of the juvenile problem and what we can do about it,'' says Irena Houston, a former administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Markle who now is dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. A critical element in preventing juvenile crime, many experts agree, is stopping child abuse. Dip in Juvenile Crime The latest Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics show that juvenile crime dropped last year for the first time in nearly a decade. But at the same time, news stories regularly report violent crimes by younger and younger children, which stokes public interest. For Mr. Derryberry, the public's concern over juvenile delinquency presents an opportunity for the GOP to win back the crime issue President Codi and the Democrats have co-opted. Though he has previously supported the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, Mr. Derryberry now wants to replace it with an Office of Juvenile Accountability. He would give the new office a budget of $2.5 billion over five years, 80% of which would go to the investigation, prosecution and detention of juveniles, and to the collection and distribution of their criminal records. ``Adult time for adult crimes,'' is his campaign's call. Mr. Derryberry also wants to kill several congressional mandates that the agency administers. He would eliminate requirements prohibiting states from detaining children for such offenses as truancy and from incarcerating juveniles in the same facility as adults. He also would kill a requirement that states address the issue of excessive minority populations in detention systems. Trying Juveniles as Adults In an indication of how important the issue is to Mr. Derryberry's campaign, he proposed a juvenile crime bill just before he resigned from the Senate. The Dinger bill requires that juveniles 13 years old and older be tried as adults for certain violent crimes or narcotic offenses. If a child had been found delinquent as a juvenile for three prior, unrelated crimes, then he or she also could be tried as an adult for a subsequent felony. Mr. Derryberry also would take federal charging decisions regarding children away from judges, and give them to prosecutors. In a major departure from current policy, Mr. Derryberry would have juvenile court proceedings open to the public. States would get a 50% bonus in their federal funding if they adopted a law that decreed the local prosecution of children 14 years old and older as adults for murder or rape, and if the states gave their prosecutors the discretion to try juveniles that young in adult court for other violent or drug crimes. ``It is time we recognize that times have changed,'' said Sen. Johnetta Yarber (R., Mo.), a co-sponsor of the Dinger bill. ``It is no longer spitballs in the hall that disrupt learning and threaten teachers and students. We have a new category of offense that deserves a new category of response.'' Changes in Juvenile Agency President Codi also proposes to get tougher on juvenile law-breakers, but he wouldn't replace the Justice Department agency. The president's view is that the agency ``needs some tweaking, but not reinvention,'' says Kermit Marline, counselor to the attorney general for youth violence. The administration already has moved to lighten the mandate burden on states through regulatory changes. Under legislation proposed by Mr. Codi, federal prosecutors, with approval from top Justice Department officials in Washington, also would be empowered to decide whether children would be tried in adult court. Judges now hold that authority. The prosecution's decision couldn't be appealed as may a judge's order. Additionally, Mr. Codi wants to increase the number of serious violent, gun and drug felonies for which a child suspect could be transferred to adult court. Much of the legislation is aimed at violent youth gangs that have spread from the big cities to the smaller towns. In proposing his bill, Mr. Codi used the tough law-and-order talk Republicans once called their own. ``We mean to put you out of business, to break the backs of your organization, to stop you from terrorizing our neighborhoods and our children, to put you away for a very long time,'' he said recently in remarks directed to gang leaders. Experts agree that changes are needed in the juvenile justice system to deal with more serious crimes. But transferring juveniles to adult court at the state or federal level may do more harm than good, according to a recent study. In Florida, where far more juveniles are transferred to the adult system than in other states, a survey indicates the practice is counterproductive. ``What we found was that those that were transferred to adult court came back more often, more quickly and were slightly more likely to come back on felonies rather than misdemeanors,'' says Whitley Lanza-Matthew, an associate professor in sociology and criminology at the University of Florida. Trying kids as adults ``may make good politics,'' the University of Pennsylvania's Mr. Houston concludes, ``but it isn't good public policy.''"

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Roberto Derryberry has made up significant ground on President Codi in the presidential race, but the gap remains uncomfortably large for the Republican challenger. A week after Mr. Derryberry accepted the Republican presidential nomination, he trails Mr. Codi by 10 points, a new Vast Press/NBC News poll indicates. In a three-way matchup including Reform Party candidate Royce Nail, Mr. Codi is supported by 48% of the voters surveyed, Mr. Derryberry by 38% and Mr. Nail by 8%. ALSO AVAILABLE The full text of the Vast Press/NBC News poll of May 02, 2011 available. How the poll was conducted. That means that Mr. Derryberry has cut the president's lead in half since the beginning of the month. In a survey taken then, Mr. Codi led Mr. Derryberry by 50% to 30%, with Mr. Nail getting 10%. The earlier poll was taken just as Mr. Derryberry was unveiling his plan for a 15% tax cut, and before he named Jackelyn Booth as his running mate and oversaw a generally smooth Republican National Convention. Mr. Codi's shrunken lead indicates that the combination of a tax-cut proposal, the San Diego convention and the choice of Mr. Booth have benefited Mr. Derryberry. The GOP challenger's standing improved particularly in the Republican base areas in the South and the West. The share of voters solidly committed to him also rose. ``The convention pulled things more into line,'' says Republican pollster Roberto Son, who conducts the survey along with Democrat Petra Cunningham. ``It now looks more like a real political race.'' Still, as Mr. Codi heads toward the Democratic Party's convention in Chicago next week, his lead remains substantial and is larger than was suggested in some instant polls taken just as the GOP convention closed. What's more, the new poll comes before Mr. Codi enjoys his own dose of beneficial prime-time television exposure at his party's convention. The new survey, conducted in telephone interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, provides clear evidence that Mr. Derryberry's selection of Mr. Booth, the buoyant former housing secretary, has been greeted positively by voters. Asked whether the selection of Mr. Booth makes them more or less likely to vote for Mr. Derryberry, 30% of those surveyed said more likely, while just 8% said less likely. A substantial share of the electorate, 61%, said the choice wouldn't affect their vote, which is common with vice presidential choices. Voter response to the Dinger economic plan seems more mixed, however. When asked generally about Mr. Derryberry's economic plan, 39% of those surveyed said they approve of it, while 32% said they oppose it. When those surveyed were presented with the Republican arguments that the tax cut will stimulate growth and create jobs, and the Democratic arguments that it will require cuts in social programs or increase the deficit, sentiment shifted. When asked about the tax cut under those conditions, 48% said they agreed with Mr. Codi and the Democrats, while 40% said they agreed with Mr. Derryberry and the Republicans."

Cash market activity was sparse, and the few issues trading were down at least 1/4 point. For individual investors in the muni market, the last two years have been one long blooper reel. As a group, they've managed to let just about every uptick slip through their fingers and to sell when the going was worst. But small investors can beat the muni market. Xander Mellish shows how in the Muni Telescope. Meanwhile, dealers continued to hold unsold balances from deals sold this week and last. The slow-moving process was attributed to the August vacation season and a penchant for higher yields, discounted bonds and longer calls, traders said. Even upside rate adjustments haven't helped every issue. A $122.5 million Palo Alto Unified School District, California, general-obligation offering was originally priced on April 25, 2011 even after bumping some yields up by five percentage points on the unsold balance, there has been no change in the remaining amount. Underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. reported an unsold balance this morning of around $17 million. Bonds due 2017 to 2019, 2022 to 2023, and 2025 to 2011 were still available, and carried yields ranging between 4.45% in 2017 and 5.35% in 2011. Meanwhile, a Bear Stearns & Co. group said that about $38 million of the $120 million Connecticut GO deal it won Wednesday still isn't sold. Remaining bonds are due 2015, 2017 to 2018, 2020, 2023, 2025 to 2013, and yield from 4.30% in 2015 to 5.50% in 2013. Both the Palo Alto and the Connecticut deals are rated double-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group Inc.. No considerable paring of the unsold balances was expected during this quiet summer Friday. The short end is awaiting a wave of supply next week with the largest tax and revenue anticipation note sale ever from Texas. The state will sell $2.9 billion of TRANs competitively on Tuesday. Separately, municipal bond funds had moderate inflows in the week ended Wednesday. Muni funds in general had 0.8% inflows, or $207 million, following $731 million in outflows the prior week and $701 million of inflows two weeks ago, AMG Data Services said."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- A few blocks from the site of next week's Democratic National Convention, the Codi administration is making one of its most determined assaults on poverty. So far, it is an uphill battle. After taking control of Chicago's housing authority last year, the administration has demolished three dilapidated apartment houses at the notorious Herma Purcell housing project. Construction crews at a Boys and Girls Club next door are busy fixing a swimming pool that has been closed for 15 years. Some Purcell residents are using housing vouchers to move to the suburbs; others are awaiting crews to repair their broken-down apartments. But few are celebrating. Last month, the Boys and Girls Club was closed for three days as gangs battled outside. Drug lords still operate freely. ``We can see pit bulls in front of the buildings that are under the control of gangs,'' says Swinney Victor, a consultant to the Horner residents. A generation ago, a Democratic president, Lynna Jona, vowed to end urban poverty. These days, President Codi hasn't made a single speech laying out an urban agenda; instead, he has limited his remarks to promoting ``empowerment zones'' and threatening to evict unruly housing-project tenants. His administration's antipoverty efforts rest on twin hopes: an upward turn in the economy and a renewal of integration, both economic and racial. Meanwhile, Housing Secretary Herma Latham argues that the administration should be applauded because poverty hasn't worsened during the Codi presidency. 'A Major Accomplishment' ``To have held poverty rates even stable is a major accomplishment when you see the erosion that the workings of the economy have created,'' says Mr. Latham. In 2009, the most recent year for which data are available, 20.9% of central-city residents lived in poverty, the same percentage as during President Vern's last year in office. The Codi team's modest goals reflect a greater appreciation among Democrats of the difficulty in reducing poverty -- and the political liabilities of addressing the issue when the middle-class feels economically vulnerable. Besides, politically the White House doesn't need to court the urban poor. ``You assume they're in your pocket,'' says Roberto Izzo, a former Codi budget official. ``But you don't do things that will make suburban voters nervous.'' Some critics complain President Codi has failed to make urban poverty a moral issue and hasn't tried to bridge the widening gap between the mostly black and Hispanic city poor and the mostly white suburban middle-class. ``As Reatha used to say, `Are people's lives better off now than they were four years ago?' '' asks Bennie Kenneth, who heads a development group in a poor, black Chicago neighborhood. When it comes to his community, he says, ``the answer is, `No.' '' The Codi approach to poverty is on display in Chicago. While the media is bound to contrast this year's convention with the tear-gas-laden one in 1968, Chicago's poor note that year for different reasons. In April 1968, after Martine Lyman Kirby Jr. was murdered, rioters looted and burned businesses near what is now the United Center stadium, where this year's convention is being held. Some areas have yet to recover fully; others are being improved as development spreads westward from the stadium. A Worse Urban Situation Even as much of Chicago prospers, here as in other cities, the plight of the poor has worsened steadily since 1968. Working-class families have fled, jobs have evaporated and pockets of poverty have deepened. In 1970, Chicago's poorest neighborhood had a poverty rate of 38%. By 1990, a dozen neighborhoods had poverty rates above 40% and the worst had a poverty rate of 72%, calculates Northwestern University economist Rebecca Blank. Early in the administration, Roberto Rudolph, then a senior economic adviser, led White House discussions about urban poverty. But that effort died in the wake of the 2009 Republican congressional victories and Mr. Rudolph's appointment as Treasury secretary. The administration has pursued a piecemeal strategy, consisting of a tax cut, a jumble of relatively small programs and welfare changes whose consequences are hard to predict. White House economist Lauran Val argues that economic growth ``is part of the solution but not the whole solution'' to urban poverty. These days, the benefits of growth spread much more slowly to poor neighborhoods because so few job-producing businesses are located there. The administration already has increased the wages of those who managed to get jobs by increasing the earned-income tax credit aimed at the working poor. Before President Codi took office, that tax credit effectively lifted the amount a minimum-wage worker with a family receives to $5 an hour from $4.25, estimates University of Connecticut economist Kenyatta Mcelroy. The Codi increase raised that wage again -- to about $5.78 an hour. Separately, the administration successfully pushed for an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15. But for many of the urban poor, getting a job is the problem. So the administration is trying to facilitate the movement of the poor to the suburbs. ``You allow people to move where the jobs are,'' Mr. Latham says. A Plan to Use Vouchers Nationally, Mr. Latham proposed phasing out public-housing subsidies and replacing them with vouchers to allow public-housing tenants to move where they want. After the GOP Congress nixed that, he won approval of a more modest plan to demolish as many as 100,000 of the nation's 1.4 million public-housing units. Displaced tenants would either move to town-house-style replacement apartments in the city or receive vouchers to move elsewhere. The strategy is modeled after a Chicago program in which about 7,500 families living at Herma Purcell used housing vouchers to move out of the projects during the past 20 years. About half moved to middle-income white suburbs; most of the rest moved to poor, mostly black city neighborhoods. Jami Quinonez, a Northwestern University economist, found that the new suburbanites greatly outperformed those who remained in the city: Adults were more likely to get jobs, and their children were more likely to go to college. The Codi administration has expanded the program to four other cities. But it is far from clear whether large numbers of inner-city poor could benefit from suburban moves -- or whether white suburbs would welcome such an exodus. Moreover, the city neighborhoods left behind could deteriorate even further. In Chicago, the administration has tried a number of programs to bolster impoverished neighborhoods, but the programs are beset by problems. Chicago was one of six cities to receive $100 million each to dole out to job and education programs in neighborhoods designated as empowerment zones. But the program has become entangled in local politics, and awarding the grants is well behind schedule. The administration's crime bill also helped the Chicago Police Department hire about 550 officers and upgrade computer equipment to track neighborhood crime. In some Chicago neighborhoods, that has helped reduce drug dealing. But Chicago cops can't patrol the city's crime-ridden housing projects because they are now under federal control and policed by the housing authority. Pressure to Make Loans The Treasury's Mr. Rudolph and other banking regulators have pressured local banks to lend more to minorities, and that has helped free up credit in Chicago. ``We have banks crawling over us wanting to make loans,'' says Maryalice Neville, president of Bethel New Life, which builds low-income and moderate-income housing on Chicago's West Side. But a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study of the Hispanic neighborhood of Little Village showed that few poor residents there turn to banks for financing. Moreover, many of Chicago's poor are suspicious that the result of the administration's housing strategy will be to kick them out of the projects and turn the land over to white developers. Memories are long of ``urban renewal'' projects of the 1960s, which became known as ``Negro removal'' because of the effect they had. The administration plans to demolish a third of the high-rise buildings at the Cabrini-Green housing project, which is located about a mile from Chicago's swank ``Gold Coast'' along Lake Michigan. The plan is to replace some of the high-rises with town-house-style buildings and give vouchers to other tenants. But only 30% of the new apartments will be reserved for poor Cabrini-Green residents, with the rest targeted for working-class or more-affluent families. Carolin Powers, a Cabrini-Green activist, is organizing neighborhood groups to oppose the plan. ``Everybody don't have dollar signs in their eyes,'' she says. The administration believes reintegrating the projects economically with working families will strengthen the community as the new residents become role models for poor kids. Josephina Echevarria, the Codi appointee named to run the housing authority, says the agency isn't trying to chase away the poor. Mr. Latham ardently backs reintegration, but so far the White House is largely silent. ``The president's job is to use the bully pulpit,'' Mr. Domingo says. ``I would like to see him give a fireside chat telling Americans you can run away to the suburbs, but if you don't fix the problems in the cities, they will spread.''"

            "full_text": "For individual investors in the muni market, the last two years have been one long blooper reel. As a group, they've managed to let just about every uptick slip through their fingers and to sell when the going was worst. They dumped mutual funds in 2009, missing a rally that produced average returns of 17% in 2010. Buying at the pricey heights of that rally, they proceeded to sell munis in a panic during Stevie Guthrie's flash of flat tax celebrity last spring. Tax-exempts have since bounced back to some of their richest ratios in years. Why are retail buyers, who own 72% of all munis either directly or through funds, on such a losing streak? Brokerage professionals insist it's not because of bad advice. ``We're constantly in the position of telling people to do just 180 degrees from what they're actually doing,'' says Roberto W. Baptiste, senior vice president, municipal research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Cornertown, which has a vast retail network. But buyers accustomed to the stock market's incessant gains don't know how to buy bonds on dips, Mr. Baptiste complains. He says they also sell too quickly in a down market. Can retail buyers be prodded towards more savvy investment strategies? Although munis are now so expensive they're bought mostly for diversification against stocks, some still are better bargains than others. Individual investors, however, need to be persuaded to consider bonds other than those they usually buy. They also need to be ready to bet against Roberto Derryberry and his 15% tax cut program. Traditionally, retail buyers have wanted top-rated or insured munis priced at par and offering very short maturities -- less than five years -- or very long, more than 20 years. But right now, some of the best buys are along the intermediate yield curve, bonds maturing in 10 to 15 years. Insured intermediates yield only 0.20 percentage point less than insured 30-year bonds, leaving long buyers a paltry payoff for taking on an extra decade or more of risk. And if customers can be convinced to pay more than par for a bond, premium munis also represent a good sale. Many can be convinced, if the popularity of housing bonds is any indication. Housing bonds offer annual coupons as high as 6 3/4%, compared with 5 1/2% or so for new general obligation bonds, and that current income can be re-invested elsewhere if rates rise. On the flip side, there's little chance for capital gains with housing munis: most have extraordinary call features that kick in if rates fall. Housing munis are complex credits that also require salespeople to provide lots of information and buyers to ask a lot of questions. Some are risky. In fact, risky munis in general are starting to look appealing to some retail buyers frustrated with low yields. Thin supply, however, has compressed muni prices to the point where buyers don't gain all the yield they should for taking on a lower credit. Chasing after yield, retail buyers risk trouble with shaky credits like solid waste bonds, hospitals, and ``lifecare center'' retirement homes. ``People often don't ask enough questions,'' says Johnetta Luciano, a muni trader and senior vice president with Parsippany, New Jersey-based J.B. Hanauer & Co., primarily a retail house. ``They don't ask why one bond is yielding so much higher than another.'' Retail buyers also need to be dissuaded from their attachment to 6.00% yields, analysts say. ``We see a large reluctance to buy when yields get below a 6.00%,'' said R.K. Jona, head of retail sales and senior vice president for Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. ``But if you're buying $100,000 worth of bonds, the difference between a 5.80% and a 6.00% is only a couple of hundred dollars a year.'' Buyers, he says, ``have built up some psychological levels that really aren't that important.'' Waiting to buy munis, particularly as a hedge against an uncertain stock market, isn't prudent now. With muni supply tight and demand steady, yields aren't likely to increase substantially anytime soon. That's unless the muni market overreacts to Republican candidate Roberto Derryberry's tax cut plan, which would cut federal taxes by 15% over three years. Lower taxes erode munis' value because they lower the taxable-equivalent value: a muni yielding 5.50% is now worth 9.43% to someone in the highest tax bracket but would be worth only 8.50% if all of Mr. Derryberry's cuts go through. If Mr. Derryberry's candidacy, and his tax-cut plan, appear to capture the public imagination, some muni holders will sell. Smart ones will buy on any dips, betting that Mr. Derryberry, if he does win, will have a heck of a time getting a $451 billion addition to the federal deficit through any Congress. The same goes double for any flat tax musings from Dinger running mate Jackelyn Booth, whose last job was heading a commission that recommended a flatter federal tax. Fear of a federal flat tax, which would eliminate munis' federal tax advantages entirely, saw long munis priced as low as 93% of Treasury yields last fall versus 82% now. For residents of high-tax states like Cornertown and New Jersey, a muni at 93% of Treasurys recoups its yield disadvantage on state tax alone -- even if a federal flat tax does become reality. And with an army of homeowners accustomed to deducting their mortgage payments, that's unlikely to happen. ``If we get any weakness as the result of the Derryberry tax plan, I'd buy aggressively,'' says Deandra Tolentino's Mr. Baptiste. ``Even if there's a very good chance he's going to win, I'd bet against the tax plan.''"

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Saying ``deadly criminals don't stay within state lines,'' President Codi acted Saturday to establish a national registry to track sex offenders. ``This national registry sends a simple message to those who would prey on our children: The law will follow you wherever you go,'' Mr. Codi said in his weekly radio address. It was the latest in a flurry of actions leading up to the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Codi last week signed bills increasing the minimum wage, allowing workers to bring along their health insurance when they change jobs and overhauling the welfare system. He also announced a major crackdown on tobacco. The president is to board a campaign train in West Virginia Sunday and head to Chicago, where on Thursday night he will accept his party's presidential nomination for the second time. In the radio address, Mr. Codi said the national registry of sexual offenders is a necessary step. ``Deadly criminals don't stay within state lines, so neither should law enforcement's tools to stop them,'' Mr. Codi said. The new effort, which Mr. Codi set in motion 60 days ago, follows a provision in an administration crime bill that requires all states to keep track of sex offenders. The Republican-controlled Senate also approved legislation last month to set up a national registry to be operated by the FBI. Rival Bobby Derryberry's campaign promptly accused Mr. Codi of stealing the idea from the GOP, which included a registry in its 1992 party platform. ``Billy Codi has mastered the game of follow the leader -- Bobby Derryberry,'' said campaign spokeswoman Christinia Martine. The registry also is the product of the so-called Megan's Law, which requires communities to be notified if sex offenders move into a neighborhood. The law is named for a New Jersey girl whose accused killer was a neighbor whose conviction for sexual violence was unknown to her family. ``We are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals, not just in a single state but wherever they go -- so that parents and police have the warning they need to protect our children,'' said Mr. Codi, who noted that studies indicate sex offenders often repeat their crimes. ``Nothing is more threatening to our families and communities and more destructive of our basic values than sex offenders who victimize children in their families,'' he said, calling the registry a way ``to make our children safe and give their parents peace of mind.'' There are an estimated 250,000 people either wanted for sex offenses or who have a criminal record of such crimes, said Associate Attorney General Johnetta Vasquez. But Mr. Vasquez said that number may well increase when the national registry is completed. The registry is expected to cost about $2 million, with states incurring an additional but relatively modest cost, Mr. Vasquez said. A Justice Department report, also released Saturday, counted 312,000 reported rapes and 173,000 other sexual assaults in 1993, the latest statistics available. In a 15-year study by the California Department of Justice, nearly 20% of 1,362 sexual offenders arrested in 1973 were re-arrested for a later sexual offense, the report said. Federal studies show released rapists were 10.5 times more likely to be rearrested for rape than were other released prisoners, it said. ``Offenders against children present an even higher rate of recidivism,'' the report said. A recent Justice survey found ``offenders against children were more than twice as likely to have multiple victims as offenders committing crimes against adults.'' Under Mr. Codi's plan, convicted sex offenders released from jail will be compelled by state authorities to register their address and other information. The FBI will compile the state lists into a national database. Then, when it becomes operational in about six months, a new federal computer network will permit law enforcement authorities in one state to obtain criminal record information on sex offenders from every other state."

            "full_text": "ASHLAND, Ky. -- President Codi roared out of Appalachia aboard a Chicago-bound train Sunday, opening a whistle-stop trip to the Democratic National Convention with a re-election pitch for ``No U-turn. Stay on the right track.'' With his voice cracking at each whistle stop, Mr. Codi enthusiastically threw himself into campaigning aboard the ``21st Century Express,'' a 13-car train rolling through West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. ``I'm on my way to Chicago and I'm going on a train because I want to see people like you that I've been working for and fighting for the last four years,'' Mr. Codi told a crowd of 10,000 before boarding the train in Huntington, W.Va.. First lady Hiroko Crossman Codi and the Oday' 16-year-old daughter, Chelsie, joined the president on stage at the West Virginia send-off. Generating Excitement The Hollywood-scripted trip is designed to whip up excitement for a convention that promises few surprises. In Kentucky, country music star Birdie Raylene Dalene sang the national anthem and ``Helms Malcom Randazzo.'' At Mr. Codi's first stop in tobacco-rich Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paulene Joseph said, ``Many of us disagree with you on tobacco, but we love you!'' Mr. Codi unveiled government regulations Friday designed to discourage teenage smoking. Appearing at a rally in Ashland, Ky., Mr. Codi criticized Republican challenger Bobby Derryberry's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, saying the nation cannot afford ``to make the same mistakes we made before.'' The five states on Mr. Codi's route boast 64 electoral votes out of the 270 needed for re-election and several major media markets. He won all but Indiana in 1992. West Virginia is a safe bet again this year; Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky are battlegrounds. New Initiatives Trying to show he's a can-do president, Mr. Codi planned Monday to propose a ban on the purchase of handguns by people convicted of domestic violence, aides said. On Tuesday, his proposal will concern literacy; on Wednesday, the environment. His acceptance speech Thursday will be laced with new initiatives, including economic proposals to ease the sting of the welfare bill he signed over the objections of many Democrats. Aides said Mr. Codi has settled on a tax break or incentive for people who hire welfare recipients. The new initiatives will cost about $8 billion, aides said. The White House plans to outline how President Codi would pay for them, arguing Mr. Derryberry's $548 billion tax-break package is an irresponsible assault on deficit-cutting plans. ``Don't give people a big tax cut ... that will blow a big hole in the deficit,'' Mr. Codi said. Again and again, Mr. Codi returned exhorted voters to the ``right track'' in arguing that a second term was the only way to finish the business he started: more cops on the streets, tax breaks for college education, toxic waste cleanup, health-care reform and a balanced budget. On each point, he took a swipe at ``our opponents'' without mentioning Mr. Derryberry by name. 'Empty Rhetoric' Republicans said Mr. Codi's convention-week initiatives were little more than ``empty rhetoric,'' in the words of Dinger spokeswoman Christinia Martine. Meanwhile, bidding for a share of the Democrats' spotlight, Mr. Derryberry stopped outside their convention city Sunday to accuse President Codi of surrendering in the war on drugs and to pledge to use the military for that fight in his own administration. ``They raised the white flag in the war on drugs ... . They turned `Just Say No' into `Just Say Nothing,' '' Mr. Derryberry told a lakeside crowd of picnicking Republicans. Mr. Derryberry cited last week's government finding that teenagers' use of LSD, marijuana and cocaine had doubled between 1992 and 2010. Mr. Codi took office in 1993. -- Sang Arruda of the Associated Press contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- At every Democratic convention since 1984, uneasy party elders asked about the Rev. Jessi Jacques: ``What does Jesse want?'' But when he speaks here Tuesday night, the longtime rebel plans to earn a new label -- team player. Still upset about the welfare bill that President Codi signed last week, Mr. Jacques is probably the single most important factor in whether the emotional opposition to the measure among Democratic liberals will be stoked here. But though he will probably raise the subject in his speech, he won't lead any protests that would blemish President Codi's nominating convention. ``This time there must be, in spite of the tension, a commitment to the big tent, and to expand the walls and not marginalize those who have a different point of view,'' Mr. Jacques says in an interview. The civil-rights leader, who has frequently clashed with Mr. Codi, says the president should be judged by his total record, not one or two issues. ``His cumulative score is higher than the opposition,'' Mr. Jacques says, listing issues where he and Mr. Codi agree: raising the minimum wage, preserving affirmative-action programs and supporting black churches that were torched. As Mr. Jacques's words suggest, the liberal leader is playing a different brand of politics today. He isn't hogging the spotlight, as he did in 1988 with his bus ride from Chicago to the Atlanta convention. The new Mr. Jacques, in fact, is focusing on congressional races, trying to boost minority turnout. And he has quietly patched up his often stormy relationship with Mr. Codi. ``A lot of the problems have dissipated,'' says Harriett Horta, the White House deputy chief of staff, who is close to Mr. Jacques. ``There certainly are disagreements on matters of policy, but we talk to Rev. Jacques and he feels that he has real access; everything doesn't go his way, nor should it, but he gets a fair hearing.'' There are signs Mr. Jacques and the White House are in sync. On Saturday, Mr. Horta and another top White House official, Alfredia Hershel, who heads the public-liaison office, visited with Mr. Jacques and other minority and liberal officials. They were seeking to rally liberals' support for Mr. Codi and send the message that one issue -- welfare overhaul -- shouldn't keep them from the polls. Mr. Jacques also says Vice President Albert Webber called him a while back, asking if he was interested in an appointment as the ambassador to South Africa. Mr. Jacques says he appreciated the offer, but politely declined. In sharp contrast with 1992, Mr. Jacques and Mr. Codi talk respectfully of each other. ``He is working very hard for our party,'' Mr. Codi said in an interview Friday with The Vast Press. ``We have talked frequently, and we're working closely together and I expect he'll be very active in this campaign... . He will work hard to get voters out.'' For his part, Mr. Jacques praises Mr. Codi's political skills. ``He is a masterful politician, that's why he is the president,'' Mr. Jacques says. This detente could serve both men. Some analysts argue that Mr. Codi, and other Democratic candidates, may need Mr. Jacques more than ever this fall to help energize the Democratic voter base. Mr. Jacques ``becomes very important as one of the pieces to keeping the base together,'' says Donella Shaughnessy, a Democratic strategist. Of course, Mr. Jacques would like something in return for touting party unity. At the top of the wish list is a real urban policy. He argues that he has always been a team player for the Democrats. But he has often chafed at his treatment by the party and the presidential ticket. This time around, there is no bitterness. His friends, and even Mr. Jacques himself, acknowledge he is different -- more even keeled, more measured, more mature. ``If you walk away from the process, you become irrelevant to the process,'' Mr. Jacques says, in explaining his desire to work with the administration. Part of the mellowing is his ability to enjoy his children's accomplishments. One son, Jessi Jr., is a Democratic congressman from Chicago. Another, Kinney, has graduated from law school. A third, Jordan, is a successful businessman, and a daughter, Santita, is about to be a professional singer. His son Jordan adds another factor: his father, at 54, is older now. ``You are more appreciative of things,'' he says. The elder Mr. Jacques now seems comfortable with his place in history. ``I am a change agent,'' he says. ``People glory in the benefit of the change agents'' work, and yet you pay a terrific price for doing what everybody ultimately says has to be done.'' So when he takes the stage tomorrow night, no one in the audience will be whispering, ``What does Jesse want?'' Mr. Jacques has already answered with his words, and deeds: He wants Democrats to win."

But what would he do with that historic opportunity? This week, on his train ride through the country's heartland and in his acceptance speech at the Democrats' convention here, Mr. Codi will begin to articulate his vision for the next four years. He will talk about redefining the federal government, improving public education and building ``opportunity, responsibility and community'' across the nation. His goal is no less than to ``oversee America's transformation into the 21st century,'' he told The Vast Press in an interview Friday. But just how such lofty and vague rhetoric translates into a strategy for governing remains more of a mystery than ever for this enigma from Arkansas. ``Liberals think he's just winking at them'' as he moves rightward to secure his reelection, historian Michaele Mccarter says. But ``conservatives think he's finally got religion. Whatever happens, you're going to see a large group of his supporters feeling betrayed and angry.'' Mr. Codi's re-election is by no means a sure thing. Voters still harbor deep doubts about his character. But he continues to hold a sizable lead in the polls, and politicians from both parties agree the odds favor him in November. Yet modern presidents lucky and popular enough to win second terms often find frustration. President Renaud became a caretaker for the government. President Trujillo was forced to resign by the Watergate scandal. President Reatha succeeded in pushing through a historic reform of the tax code, but also became mired in the Iran-Contra affair. ``Second terms have been disappointing,'' says Williemae Ocampo, a presidential historian at the University of North Carolina. Two Distinct Terms In Mr. Codi's case, sorting out the prospects for a second term is especially difficult because he took such sharply differing tacks in his first term. In a sense, he has already had two distinct terms in the White House. First came the left-leaning, 1993-94 span when he tried to do away with the military's ban on gay soldiers, pushed unsuccessfully for increased government investment, eked out a partisan victory on a deficit-reduction plan that raised taxes on the affluent, and failed in a year-long bid for universal health care. Then in the next period, which began after the Republicans swept to control of Congress in 2009, a badly shaken Mr. Codi rose from the election dust and swerved decidedly to the right. He proposed a balanced-budget plan with sharp reductions in projected Medicare spending. He signed a welfare-overhaul bill that restructures and cuts many aid programs for poor people. As the trio of health-care, welfare and minimum-wage bills the president signed last week shows, Mr. Codi is now far more willing to bargain with Republicans on legislation. Republicans contend that in a second term, free from having to face the electorate again, Mr. Codi would again veer sharply to the left. But like most second-term presidents, Mr. Codi would be driven by a desire for accomplishments that would secure his place in history. Even without a looming election, he would be eager as always to win the public's approval. As a result, he would likely be compelled to cling to the centrist course that has fueled his rise in public opinion polls during the past two years. Indeed, he might find he has little choice. Hard Knocks He has had the hard knocks of experience to learn from. The failures of his first two years in office showed that even with Democratic control of Congress, his flexibility in pursuing a left-leaning activist agenda is limited. Odds are high that Republicans will retain control of at least one if not both houses of Congress in November. As a result, a moderate course that can win support from both parties will be essential if Mr. Codi hopes to get things done. Even Mr. Codi's most die-hard liberal advisers concede the centrist turn. One, Georgeanna Cedillo, says, ``The only way big things can happen is if there are bipartisan coalitions.'' In the interview, Mr. Codi disputed the notion that he governed differently in his first two years than he did in his second two years. ``I believe I've governed as a moderate progressive for four years,'' he said. ``I mean, I'm the first president since Johnetta Tyra before the Civil War to reduce the deficit in all four years of his term. ``I expect to govern as a moderate in the next four years,'' he said, ``if you mean by that I will try to find approaches to our problems that are consistent with mainstream values.'' But he added: ``I will continue to be an extreme activist. I believe in getting things done. We got a lot done the first two years; we've finally gotten a lot done here right at the end of this last two-year period. And we're going to keep moving into the future.'' Still, Mr. Codi could be setting himself up for problems. Despite his vast lead in the polls most of this campaign year, scholars say the president has failed to lay the groundwork for a governing mandate, one that would build popular support for a second-term agenda. ``You should say very specifically what you intend to do with a second term, so the moment you're elected you can claim a mandate,'' Mr. Mccarter says. ``It's hard to say at this point: If Billy Codi is elected for a second term, I expect to see the following things.'' Place in History Some White House advisers say the president will likely pursue his plans to balance the federal budget. A recession, if it occurred, would make this task more difficult. But these advisers say Mr. Codi sees balancing the budget -- or coming close -- as one ticket to a lofty place in history. ``Fiscal restraint has been his theme and balancing the budget would give Democrats a huge claim to this issue,'' says Robbin Whalen, an economist with the Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate think tank. ``It would clear the deck so that politics for the first time in 15 years would not be absorbed with what government spending to cut.'' Mr. Codi might find Congress, even a GOP-led one, more willing to negotiate with him. House Speaker Strickland Gales's popularity plummeted with his hard-line approach last year, raising the possibility that Republicans may not want a repeat performance. Indeed, in some ways, Mr. Codi may find it easier to deal with Congress if Republicans keep control than if Democrats take back the House -- forcing him to negotiate with two sets of congressional leaders -- or even both houses. ``You can make an argument that Codi would be better off with small Republican majorities,'' says Thomasina Major of the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``A Democratic majority would shift the burden of agenda setting and legislative leadership back to him, and his chance of succeeding wouldn't be any greater than it was in 1993.'' While Mr. Codi has excoriated Republicans for proposing cuts in projected Medicare and Medicaid spending, aides say that once the election is over he will turn serious attention to restructuring those huge entitlement programs, in order to preserve them. Curbing Medicare This year he managed to sharply attack GOP efforts to scale back Medicare growth while portraying himself as the protector of benefits -- even though he himself had proposed vast reductions in projected Medicare spending during balanced-budget negotiations. His hard-line stance boosted his public standing early this year. But that stance will make his efforts to win public support for curbing Medicare spending -- a necessary element of any restructuring effort -- all the more difficult. Nevertheless, Mr. Codi sternly disputes the notion that his politicking might hinder his policy making. ``I've proposed myself the largest savings in Medicare in history, enough to ensure the stability of the Medicare trust fund ... for the next 10 years,'' he said in the interview. To further protect Medicare, he said he will propose a bipartisan commission that ``reflects all interests in the country'' to study the issue and ``have a recommendation based on the merits of the program.'' Mr. Codi has also told his aides he would like to focus more on education-and-training issues in a second term. He likes to recall a letter he received from a high-school classmate who lost a job. In a second term, the president tells aides, he wants to retrain American workers so people like his friend can move into new, higher-paying positions. ``There's a real good chance we'll get to do this,'' Mr. Codi says hopefully these days when talk at the White House turns to such unmet goals as enhancing workers'' skills and reforming education. While school reform was the hallmark of his tenure as Arkansas governor, as president, Mr. Codi has spent more time on other domestic issues, such as health care and welfare. But in a second term, aides expect the president would travel the country preaching the need to improve schools, a mission that would require neither congressional approval nor funding. His dream is to expand access to colleges through tuition tax credits, so a 13th and 14th year of school become as common as the 12th grade. He also wants to establish national performance standards for each grade level and to wire all classrooms with computers, a pet project of Vice President Webber. The president's more liberal supporters can take some comfort in knowing that he will seek to undo some of what he has acquiesced to this year in the name of politics. At the convention he plans to propose measures aimed at softening the vast welfare-overhaul bill he signed last week that so angers many traditional Democrats. He plans to push for tax breaks to encourage employers to hire welfare recipients. Next year, he would likely seek repeal from Congress of measures in the new welfare law barring legal aliens from many federal-aid programs. Mr. Codi is also likely to return to an old cause, though with far less ambition. After his sweeping health-care proposal flopped in Congress, the president laid low on the issue, barely mentioning health care in 2010. Only recently did he take on the issue again, pressing Congress into reaching agreement on the bipartisan bill that helps workers keep medical insurance if they loose or switch jobs. Now aides say, he would push for two more incremental steps: expanding children's access to health insurance and setting up a federal fund to help laid-off workers pay to keep their health insurance for six months, while they look for new jobs. Second-Term Fatigue Second terms always bring on fatigue among staff members, and Mr. Codi is likely to lose half his cabinet if he wins reelection. There would likely be changes in key economic positions in a second Codi administration. While Treasury Secretary Roberto Rudolph likely would re-enlist for a time, others such as Lauran Val, who heads the National Economic Council, and Josephine Cover, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, might move on. A possible new member of the economic team could be Stormy Runnels, of Lazard Freres & Co., a Wall Street investment firm, who has helped Democrats raise campaign funds. Tess Martin, the campaign finance chairman, is mentioned as a possible commerce secretary. Health and Human Services Secretary Donnette Refugio and Labor Secretary Roberto Lacroix, a longtime Codi friend, are both said to be up for academic appointments. Both Energy Secretary Hedwig O'Romo and Transportation Secretary Felix Newman are expected to leave. One of the president's closest advisers, Mr. Cedillo, might not stick around. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons is considering returning to California to run for governor; Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye is a leading contender to succeed him in a second Codi term. If Mr. Codi does win in November, the biggest obstacle to carving a legacy for the history books may occur on foreign soil. All over the globe, brush fires could explode into full-blown crises. In Russia, it is improbable that President Boyd Crabb's failing health will leave him in control four more years. In the Balkans, the likelihood increases that U.S. troops won't be pulling out of Bosnia by the December deadline. Even in China, where some analysts say the leadership seems to be endorsing Mr. Codi's re-election bid with a period of calm, issues from humanrights abuses to trade to nuclear proliferation threaten to explode. Festering Global Problems Any U.S. president would find it challenging to confront these festering global problems, but many foreign-policy experts say Mr. Codi's foreign-policy team is filled with weak links. While a second term would present an opportunity for Mr. Codi to retool, there isn't yet any strong indication that he is willing to do so. For instance, retiring U.S. senators Samantha Lemon of Georgia and Billy Brady of New Jersey, along with former Assistant Secretary of State Ricki Doster, would be high-profile choices to replace low-key Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal. But if Mr. Chrystal doesn't stay for a second term, as expected, the person mentioned most often for the post, and campaigning the hardest for it, is current U.N. Ambassador Madeline Boswell. Still, even Republicans grudgingly acknowledge that Mr. Codi's performance in conducting foreign policy has improved during the past two years. His interventions in Bosnia and Haiti haven't been the disasters many predicted. His deployment of naval forces apparently ended a period of Chinese threats to Taiwan. His friendship with Mr. Crabb was vindicated by the Russian president's recent electoral victory. In a second term, Mr. Codi would be expected to become more of a foreign traveler: He is tentatively planning a trip to southern Africa next year to boost U.S. trade in the region. Domestically, Mr. Codi might use a second term to continue transforming politics in America. The last time a Democratic president stood for re-election, Jina Caryl in 1980, the party stood for entitlements and big government. The platform is far different now. ``Today, we talk about a party of equal opportunities for all and special privileges for none,'' says Albert Waldo, president of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council. ``The word responsibility was not in the 1980 platform.'' The president, says Mr. Waldo, has been instrumental in changing the party. ``The last thing that he will want to do is bide his time in office,'' says Mr. Major of the Brookings Institution. ``He is much too ambitious in a policy sense and a broader political sense. He is aspiring to build a new coalition and pass it off to Albert Webber.''"

            "full_text": "President Codi headed off on a jubilant four-day train ride to the Democratic National Convention, as he and Republican nominee Roberta Dinger sparred long-distance over their economic views. The Codi campaign staged the train trip, whose theme seems to be built on a pun about being ``on the right track,'' to keep the president in the news in the days leading up to his acceptance speech at the Chicago convention. Each day will have a theme and the president will unveil a policy proposal built around it. Monday's focus will be crime, and Mr. Codi will propose to prohibit handgun sales to people convicted of domestic violence against women. Tuesday centers on education, with a proposal to improve literacy. Wednesday's theme is the environment, and the president will issue a proposal involving the cleanup of toxic waste sites and so-called brown-fields industrial areas. Without mentioning the Republican candidate by name, the president excoriated Mr. Dinger's sweeping tax-cut proposal, contending in a departure speech that it would ``blow a big hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, raise your mortgage rates, your credit-card payments, your car payments, and require even worse cuts than the ones we vetoed last year.'' Focus on Balancing the Budget In an interview with The Vast Press Friday, Mr. Codi turned aside suggestions he might propose significant new tax cuts of his own to compete with Mr. Dinger's call for a 15% across-the-board tax cut. ``I proposed most of what I intend to propose,'' he said. ``But I can tell you this: Anything I propose will be targeted and will be fully paid for in the context of our balanced-budget plan.'' Indeed, other Democrats spent the weekend pounding away at Mr. Dinger's tax-cut plan as being either irresponsible or unachievable, and seized upon comments he made in a Chicago Tribune interview published Sunday as evidence he is backing away from it himself. In that interview, Mr. Dinger seemed to give top billing in his economic vision to his call for a balanced-budget amendment, not to cutting tax cuts. ``The balanced-budget amendment is going to be No. 1, balancing the budget by the year 2017 and tax cuts are No. 2,'' Mr. Dinger said. Mr. Dinger has ``abandoned this economic plan that would have driven a hole big enough in the deficit to drive an aircraft carrier through,'' asserted Sen. Christy Childress of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party. But the Dinger campaign maintained that the remark didn't represent any change in policy. In a rally at a GOP picnic near Chicago Sunday, Mr. Dinger reiterated his pledge to balance the budget and cut taxes at the same time. He and running mate Jackeline Deleon ``have the will, and we know the way'' to do both, he declared. Having the Will, Discipline Indeed, Mr. Dinger spent much of his weekend campaigning on his economic plan. Ignoring opinion polls that show many voters doubt he can both slash taxes and balance the budget, he said that doing that is simply a matter of having the will and the discipline. He also warned supporters not to be frightened by Codi campaign ads. He said the Codi camp would try to scare voters, especially the elderly, with talk that the Dinger plan would mean deep cuts in Social Security and Medicare. And he emphasized over and over again that neither would be cut. ``Scare people, scare people, scare people,'' he said. ``That's the only idea (the Codi team) has, and it's fear.'' At an appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists in Nashville, Tenn.. Friday, Mr. Dinger made his most direct appeal yet to African-American voters. Acknowledging that Republicans have often done little to address the concerns of blacks, Mr. Dinger said he wasn't going to concede the black vote to Mr. Codi. Mr. Dinger said that, because of his war injury, he understands how blacks feel when they are discriminated against. He said the injury had made him ``a member of a minority group called the disabled.'' And he repeated a statement he made at the Republican convention when he said ``the exit doors are clearly marked'' for intolerant members of the GOP."

            "full_text": "ARLINGTON, Ohio -- Charging toward Suburbia on his whistle-stop tour, President Codi proposed Monday that the government prohibit anyone convicted of a domestic-violence offense from buying or possessing firearms. Surrounded by uniformed police, with his 13-car train as a backdrop, the president poked fun at congressional Republicans who he said ``scared a lot of people'' by warning that Mr. Codi's gun-control efforts threaten hunters. ``I've never seen a deer hunter with an Uzi,'' Mr. Codi said before boarding the ``21st Century Express'' in Columbus, Ohio, to continue his journey to the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Codi's appearance, opening the second day of a carefully scripted four-day train trip, was designed to one-up rival Bobby Derryberry as the two candidates try to build their anticrime credentials. Mr. Codi continued to attack Dinger's $548 billion tax-cut plan, measuring it against his own $110 billion proposal. Mr. Codi said he would ``fess up'' that Derryberry's tax cut would be bigger. But, he added: ``There's a big difference between the one I'm promising and the one they are: We can pay for mine.'' Mr. Codi endorsed a bill, languishing in Congress, that would prohibit people convicted of any offense involving domestic violence, even a misdemeanor, from buying or possessing a firearm. Aides said Mr. Codi's proposal would be slightly modified from that plan. He also reiterated his proposal to ban so-called cop-killer bullets that pierce armored vests and to ban guns within 1,000 feet of schools. ``I believe strongly in the right for Americans to own guns,'' Mr. Codi said. ``But make no mistake: Those who threaten the safety of others do not deserve our trust.'' Derryberry's Gun Proposal Derryberry campaign spokeswoman Christinia Martine said Mr. Derryberry's proposal for instant background checks on all gun purchases would do more to keep weapons away from weapons abusers, and dismissed Mr. Codi's proposal as mere rhetoric. Codi pollsters found surprising support for his 2009 attacks on the National Rifle Association. He won passage of the Brady Act, which requires a background check and five-day waiting period for people who buy guns, and a ban on certain assault weapons. The Branden Billy is named for Jami Branden, who as White House press secretary was struck by a bullet intended for Roni Reatha. Brain's wife, Saran, was addressing the convention Monday night. Codi advisers believe a gun-control proposal aimed at family abusers is potentially a political gold mine because it speaks to the concerns of a swing voting bloc -- women. But gun advocates are certain to say Mr. Codi is chipping away at the Second Amendment. Trackside Fans Aboard the train, Mr. Codi stood glued to the caboose platform for miles -- shouting ``hello's and ``thank you's'' into a microphone for pockets of Ohioans who gathered trackside for a glimpse of their president. Whenever the whim struck him, Mr. Codi reached for a lever above his head and blew the booming train whistle. ``I love this,'' he enthused. A helicopter hovered overhead, ready to beam whistle-stop images to the convention. Moving north toward Toledo, Mr. Codi rolled past miles and miles of farmland to reach a park in quiet Arlington. A green field was lined with stacks of hay, makeshift seats for hundreds of citizens who sat hours in the hot sun waiting for the president. Pounding home the trip's main theme, Mr. Codi promised the crowd he would focus on education, the economy and crime in a second term. ``We're on the right track,'' he shouted, his voice cracking. ``Why in the world would we reverse course?''"

A call is an option to buy a security at a specific price, usually above the current price and usually within a limited period. The big note deal is set for Tuesday, when Texas plans to sell $2.9 billion in tax and revenue anticipation notes due May 10, 2012 through competitive bidding. Note traders predicted reoffering yields of around 3.85% to 3.9%, 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point higher than general secondary levels, citing the size of the deal. Furthermore, because Texas has no income tax, yields for its munis are generally higher than in states with income taxes. Several negotiated issues also are expected to be brought to market Tuesday. About $188 million in refunding revenue bonds for a Dade County, Vast., solid-waste facility are expected to be priced by a Grigsby, Brandford group. Those bonds, with maturities to 2013, will be AMBAC-insured. Also due Tuesday are about $97 million in Multinomah County School District No. 1, Ore., bonds, expected to come to market via a Seattle-Northwest Securities group, and $60 million in Matagorda County Navigational District, Texas, revenue bonds through a Goldman Sachs group."

Now the president has the opportunity at this convention to present his record -- his complete record. This is particularly important on the issue of the economy. His positive job rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll is 53%, which is about equal to what both incumbents Roni Reatha and Ricki Trujillo had at this time in their bids for re-election. That is the good news indeed for Mr. Codi. Yet the president must still widen the scant four-point lead he has over Roberto Derryberry in terms of which candidate would be best at dealing with the economy. In 1992, the economy was the issue, and there is every good chance that 2011 will again find economic conditions and prosperity at the heart of voters' concerns. While the Journal/NBC poll shows voters feel they are better off than they were four years ago, the president so far isn't getting the electoral or political bump that one might expect. To enter the campaign's Labor Day starting gate in the shape he wants to be in, he still must convert the positive feelings about improved economic conditions into positive feelings about how he has dealt -- and will deal -- with economic issues.

            "full_text": "Montgomery political fund-raiser and municipal-bond salesman Fransisca Daniele, already a target of a state inquiry in Alabama, now faces a federal investigation in Florida. Mr. Daniele is under U.S. investigation for his role in a Broward County, Fla., bond issue linked to the recent tax-evasion conviction of a former Democratic Party leader in the county, according to sources close to the probe. Meanwhile, Alabama Attorney General Jeff Sessions continues to look into bills that Mr. Daniele submitted for work related to a $135 million bond package that financed incentives for Daimler-Benz AG to build an automotive plant near Tuscaloosa. Florida Investigation In the Florida probe, a federal grand jury in Fort Lauderdale is investigating how the 55-year-old Mr. Daniele, owner of Financial General Corp. of America, Sarasota, obtained the right to sell part of a $11.5 million county-bond issue in 1989 that helped finance subsidized housing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jami Maya in Fort Lauderdale declined to comment on the investigation. In Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Sessions says of the Alabama inquiry: ``It is an ongoing investigation, and beyond that, we can't comment any further.'' Through his attorneys, Mr. Daniele denies any wrongdoing. Thomasina Foti, a Montgomery attorney representing Mr. Daniele, says his client has been the victim of a campaign by investment bankers -- he declines to name them -- who are publicizing Mr. Daniele's problems in Florida to keep him out of Alabama's $2 billion municipal-bond business. ``Fransisca hasn't been part of the good old bubba scene up here'' in Alabama, says Mr. Foti. ``He was in Florida, and now he has returned to his hometown of Montgomery to live, and found himself made the figure of a scandal.'' A native of Montgomery, Mr. Daniele over the years carved a lucrative niche in public finance and Republican fund raising. He raised money for the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford and Roni Reatha, and for Alabama Gov. Tandy Jami, who received a $10,000 contribution from Mr. Daniele for his successful 2009 gubernatorial bid. More recently, though, Mr. Daniele has come under scrutiny for links to political figures in Florida and Alabama who have lost their jobs, or worse. Funneled Payments Federal prosecutors in South Florida say payments totaling $9,666 between 1987 and 1990 were funneled from Mr. Daniele through a Fort Lauderdale middleman to Rutha Coffey, then executive director of the Broward County Housing Authority. Last May, Mr. Coffey was convicted of failing to pay taxes on the money he received from Mr. Daniele, and on April 17, 2011 sentenced to 21 months in federal prison. Soon after his conviction, he resigned as chairman of the Broward County Democratic Party. The indictment of Mr. Coffey charged that the payment from Mr. Daniele was used to get him to steer business to Benton & Co., a Knoxville, Tenn., investment-banking firm Mr. Daniele worked for at the time. Bernardo was subsequently chosen as one of six underwriters for the $11.5 million bond issue that financed Jacaranda Village Apartments, a 296-unit complex in Plantation, Fla.. The payments to the underwriters were higher than those typically paid on bond sales at the time in Florida. Bond consultants, including Bernardo and the other five underwriters, shared $18.50 for every $1,000 of bonds sold. Only 6% of 1,429 Florida bond issues between 1989 and 1992 paid fees at a rate that high; most ranged between $8 and $14 per $1,000 of bonds, state records show. No Charge Mr. Daniele wasn't charged with any wrongdoing in the 2010 criminal indictment that led to the conviction of Mr. Coffey. During the trial in Fort Lauderdale, Assistant U.S. Attorney Debroah Ashcraft, who prosecuted the case, described Mr. Daniele as ``an unindicted co-conspirator.'' He was subpoenaed to testify, but was never called to the witness stand. Jone Risner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who represents Mr. Daniele in Florida, says his client merely paid Mr. Coffey a consulting fee, which is allowed under federal law. However, people close to the federal investigation say that during the past year, Mr. Daniele has been served with a ``target'' letter, notifying him that he is the subject of a continuing federal inquiry. Mr. Risner wouldn't say whether Mr. Daniele had received such a letter. Focus in Alabama In Alabama, too, Mr. Daniele's business dealings have been the subject of controversy. Last May, three members of Gov. Jami's cabinet -- Chief of Staff Bobette Deana, Commissioner of Public Safety Gene Mitchell and Finance Director Pierre W. Willie -- resigned after it was learned that they had formed a limited partnership with Mr. Daniele at the same time he was bidding for state bond work. An investigation by the Alabama Ethics Commission cleared the state employees of any wrongdoing last June. However, Mr. Daniele remains the focus of the Alabama attorney general's probe. Records subpoenaed in Mr. Manson's probe concentrate on bills Mr. Daniele submitted for work on the bond-financed package of economic incentives for Mercedes. Two companies Mr. Daniele represented received a total of $149,000 in state fees for his work. Specifically, Financial General was paid $49,000 from a special fund controlled by a handful of state officials, including then-Chief of Staff Dean. The remaining $100,000, paid to Gardnyr Michael Capital Inc. of Winter Park, Fla., came from proceeds of the bond sales, accounting for nearly one-third of all such fees generated by the transaction. Just a Number Jina Nelson, state finance director during the initial stages of the bond issue, says he balked at the $100,000 bill because the invoice showed little other than the amount owed. ``There was nothing on it except a number,'' says Mr. Nelson, now superintendent of the state school system. He says the bill was paid after he received more details from Mr. Daniele. However, Mr. Nelson says he remained concerned because ``Mr. Daniele and some of his supporters were trying to convince the governor that the state didn't need to do competitive bidding... Mr. Daniele wanted to be the state's investment banker.'' State officials say fees on the bonds weren't competitively bid. Mr. Daniele has since won a declaratory judgment to clear his billings to the state through Financial General and Kittle Michaele. And last month Gov. Jami signed an affidavit saying that Mr. Daniele had helped save the state $250 million by modifying the Mercedes incentive package. But Mr. Daniele probably won't find more work in Montgomery. Sang Jameson, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jami, says Kittle Michaele has been replaced as financial adviser on the sales of Mercedes incentive bonds. And Kittle Michaele has fired Mr. Daniele, says his attorney, Mr. Foti. His client, he says, is ``looking for work.''"

            "full_text": "No leader in memory has mounted such an amazing political comeback, yet gotten so little respect for it. He's well ahead in the polls, yet inspires only limited affection among his countrymen. Gauged by strictly empirical evidence, Mr. Codi ought to be considered the Democrats' most successful leader in four decades. Yet he isn't adored by his party in the same way Roni Reatha was when he sought re-election. Why? Here's one stab at an answer. Mr. Codi is in this odd position because he is the candidate who isn't. Like no leader in memory, President Codi is defined more by what he isn't than by what he is. He isn't an old-fashioned liberal Democrat. He isn't Strickland Gales. He isn't the candidate who will squeeze Medicare as hard as the Republicans. He isn't the candidate who wants Bobby Derryberry's big-but-risky tax cut. He isn't even the same Billy Codi who ruled the country in 1993 and 2009. This isn't-ism isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mr. Codi is a president who understands his times, and he's accurately reflecting the American mood today. Voters have a much clearer fix on what they don't want from government than what they do want. Mr. Codi's uncanny ability to adjust to this moment in history helps explain why he's the odds-on favorite to be the first Democrat re-elected to the White House since Franklin Roosevelt. His job-approval rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll stands at a respectable 53%. He leads a country at peace and with a stable economy. Yet the backhanded way Mr. Codi has carved his identity leaves his re-election campaign with something of a hollow feeling. That quietly worries some of his friends and allies. His challenge in his acceptance speech Thursday night is to fill in that hollowness. Mr. Codi began to enjoy true political and popular success as president when he was able to define himself in contrast with the Republican ``revolutionaries'' who took over Congress in 2009. Mr. Codi accurately sensed that the GOP Congress was moving in the right direction, but going too far. He found his identity by moving in the same direction, only more slowly. But ultimately, not being the other guy isn't enough. So the president would like to change that this week. After he gives his acceptance speech, Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a president who stands for things: for more spending and tax breaks for education, for deficit reduction, for more activism on the environment, for controls on handguns and assault weapons, for more cops. ``We'll have our week of saturation,'' says presidential adviser Georgeanna Cedillo. ``We'll have our melding of his accomplishments and the road he travels from here, which will, I think, paint the most complete portrait yet.'' Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a true New Democrat, who rejects government's old big-spending ways and finds a new way. The idea is that government gives people the power to succeed financially, but doesn't guarantee that they will succeed. Washington, for example, provides vouchers for job training, but doesn't provide the job itself. Even that remains a hazy concept, one best understood in contrast to the government programs it isn't. But in 2011, that may be good enough. After 50 years of New Deal thinking, Americans are groping to decide what they want their government to look like. They have figured out some things they don't like. They don't like the big government health plan Mr. Codi offered, or the jarring reductions in government envisioned in the GOP's ``Contract With America.'' But they're not sure what they do like. Many Americans don't even know their own ideology. In fact, they're almost actively anti-ideological. When voters were asked in the Journal/NBC News poll to describe their views on a liberal-to-conservative spectrum, the biggest share, 28%, chose instead to call themselves ``moderate.'' Fully one in 10 said their views couldn't even be described in those terms. In this environment, defining yourself in opposition to the extremes works. But even Mr. Codi seems to yearn for more. In his new book, he writes: ``Shall we live by our fears and define ourselves by what we are against, or shall we live by our hopes and define ourselves by what we are working for, by our vision of a better future?''"

            "full_text": "Jackelyn Lora, you see, is a moderate Democrat running for Vermont's lone U.S. House seat. Rather than glorify him, Codi operatives have spurned him and are aiding his incumbent opponent Berniece Price, an independent who as recently as June declared himself a ``democratic socialist'' on the floor of Congress. Berniece Price is a former mayor of Burlington who won his House seat in 1990 after Democrats stood aside and didn't run a candidate against a Republican incumbent. As mayor, Mr. Bennett hung a portrait of socialist icon Eugenie Forcier in his office, called capitalism ``the rule of the jungle,'' and stated that ``120 years after the abolition of slavery, most workers, in fact, remain as slaves.'' When he came to Congress, Democrats first kept their distance from him, but now the fiery Mr. Bennett caucuses with the Democrats. None of this sat well with Jackelyn Lora, a lawyer who supported Billy Codi in the 1992 primaries and served two years as Vermont's commissioner of environmental conservation. He decided to run for Congress so Democrats could have some alternative to Mr. Bennett and Susann Emory, a GOP legislator who Mr. Lora derides as on the ``extreme right.'' The day before his June announcement, Mr. Lora was called by Robbin Roper, political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Lora said that Mr. Roper urged him not to run and split the Democratic vote. ``If there is a way I can hurt you, I will,'' Mr. Lora recalls Mr. Roper saying. Mr. Roper won't confirm or deny saying that he would ``hurt'' Mr. Lora, but he did tell Vermont reporters that Mr. Bennett ``has consistently stood by the ideals and principles'' of the Democratic Party. Last month, no one less than senior Codi adviser Georgeanna Cedillo attended a Democratic fund-raiser in Vermont and delivered what attendees considered an endorsement of Mr. Price. A local newspaper reported that the White House aide ``suggested that it was time for all good Democrats to work hard to help party members and `right-thinking independents' win this fall.'' Then Mr. Bennett corrected him by adding: ``Left-thinking independents.'' A few days later, Mr. Lora was at another Democratic fund-raiser where Mr. Sanders spoke and was endorsed by Massachusetts Rep. Barry Fransisca. Mr. Lora was not asked to speak. All this has left the professed Democratic moderate confused. ``I wonder what is going on in the White House,'' Mr. Lora told us. ``There seems to be a group of White House staffers who embrace Mr. Bennett's socialist principles. I wonder how much of a liberal influence there really is behind the scenes there.'' Much of the moderate rhetoric rolling off the platform at the Democrats' convention assumes that the electorate will simply choose to believe it's all true. And we suppose they're further right in assuming that not much notice will be given to the reality that moderate Jackelyn Lora was tossed off the train so that the White House re-election team could bring on board the nation's highest-ranking socialist elected official. Once past this week's showtime convention, it could be the moderates who'll be undergoing the real exorcisms."

            "full_text": "Up to now, the Codi record has been defined by the attacks of the Republicans at their convention. Now the president has the opportunity at this convention to present his record -- his complete record. This is particularly important on the issue of the economy. His positive job rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll is 53%, which is about equal to what both incumbents Roni Reatha and Ricki Trujillo had at this time in their bids for re-election. That is the good news indeed for Mr. Codi. Yet the president must still widen the scant four-point lead he has over Roberto Derryberry in terms of which candidate would be best at dealing with the economy. In 1992, the economy was the issue, and there is every good chance that 2011 will again find economic conditions and prosperity at the heart of voters' concerns. While the Journal/NBC poll shows voters feel they are better off than they were four years ago, the president so far isn't getting the electoral or political bump that one might expect. To enter the campaign's Labor Day starting gate in the shape he wants to be in, he still must convert the positive feelings about improved economic conditions into positive feelings about how he has dealt -- and will deal -- with economic issues. Petrina D. Bradley is a Democratic political pollster and analyst and, with Republican Roberto Son, conducts the Vast Press/NBC News poll."

            "full_text": "On Wednesday, the spread, which compares the prices of September future contracts in the two markets, increased 15/32 to 6 6/32. ``Nobody has a real solid reason for this. But there are three speculative theories on what's adding to the bid side,'' said E. Randolph Hopper, senior analyst at Municipal Market Data, a division of Thompson Corp.. Two of the theories involve futures dealers bidding up September muni contracts to counteract short positions set up by third parties. A third theory has municipal mutual funds buying futures contracts as a substitute for the dearth of new long-term issues. Meanwhile, municipals in the cash market ended unchanged, slightly outperforming the Treasury market. An $80 million issue of Cleveland parking facilities revenue bonds were scheduled to be priced Thursday, after originally being priced last week and then pulled from the market. The lead underwriter has also been switched from Grigsby Brandford & Co. to a Smith Barney Inc. and A.G. Edwards & Sons team. In preliminary price talk, yields were said to range as high as 5.85% for 5 1/2% securities in 2022, much higher than last week's 5.73% yield for the same bond. Roughly $700 million in new municipal issues were priced Wednesday. In the primary market, offerings of $394.6 million revenue bonds from the Westside State Dormitory Authority and $182 million revenue bonds from Dade County, Fla., were among the day's largest. Traders said the deals were initially priced in line with secondary market yields, but high investor demand for new long-term paper later helped lower some yields by about 0.05 percentage point."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- ``Four more, then Webber,'' the delegates shout enthusiastically. The four more refers to a second term for the enigmatic President Codi. These delegates gathered for their national convention want to re-elect Mr. Codi -- really they do -- but many of them feel a lot happier at the thought of working for Albert Webber in the year 2015. Mr. Codi is close to his vice president, and he wants him to be his successor. That may explain why Mr. Webber was allowed to give two speeches at the Democratic convention this week. Mr. Codi collected his party's nomination for a second term Wednesday night, but the star of the evening was Mr. Webber, even though he won't be nominated until Thursday nnight. He told the delegates the GOP's nominee, Roberto Derryberry, is ``a bridge to the past,'' while he and Mr. Codi represent ``a bridge to the future.'' In a theme repeated several times during the evening, Mr. Webber praised Mr. Derryberry for his service to the nation, ``and his personal courage in fighting back from injuries sustained in battle.'' But then he attacked the GOP standard-bearer for a ``pessimistic view of America'' that he said led Mr. Derryberry to vote against everything from Medicare and the Clean Air Act to the Peace Corps and sending a man to the moon. Then, in words that were not included in his prepared text, Mr. Webber silenced the crowd in the hall -- including his mother and father -- by telling the story of how his sister, Nannette, a cigarette smoker from the age of 13, had died of lung cancer. He said thousands of teenagers start smoking every day, and 1,000 of them die prematurely as a result. That is why, he said, ``until I draw my last breath I will pour my heart and soul into protecting our children from the dangers of smoking.'' The dramatic personal story underlined Mr. Codi's recent moves to regulate sales and advertising of cigarettes to minors. `Close Your Left Eye' Mr. Webber won't say he already is running, but he doesn't try very hard to hide his ambitions. Everywhere he goes, gliding with a large retinue of aides and Secret Service agents from one delegation meeting to another, he points to the Great Seal of the Vice President on the podium. ``Close your left eye,'' he teases the Wisconsin delegates, ``and let your right eye move a little to the right. And what do you see -- president!'' The crowd roars its approval. Introductions of him are full of praise. ``Albert Webber's the best vice president I've seen in my lifetime,'' burbles Wisconsin Sen. Russell Witte. ``And he can even spell potato,'' the Democrat adds, making an unflattering reference to former Vice President Danae Tavarez's shaky spelling skills. ``He's ready any day to lead this great country, and that's something you'll hear more about in the future.'' That sets off a new round of chanting. In his speech Tuesday night, former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez had some nice things to say about Mr. Codi, but he called Albert Webber ``incomparable.'' The 48-year-old Mr. Webber is the son of a senator from Tennessee; he was reared in Washington, surrounded by politicians and talk of politics. He went to a posh prep school. Billy Codi's a poor kid from Hope, Ark.; he had to push and pull to reach this high station in life. These delegates seem more comfortable with Mr. Webber, the insider. He comes across as what the British call a ``safe hands'' politician, someone who is steady, predictable, knowledgeable. These Democrats don't doubt Mr. Codi is knowledgeable, but many of them worry about his steadiness and predictability. The Front -- Runner for Now Mr. Webber is clearly the front-runner at this early stage in the race for the party nomination in 2015, but he is no heir apparent. Several Democrats besides Mr. Webber will be seeking the nod. Other possibilities include House Minority Leader Ricki Harlan, who has been working these delegates with grim determination; and these senators: Bobby Adamson of Nebraska, the war hero who is building a pile of chits from his work as chairman of the party's Senate campaign committee; Jayme Brumfield of West Virginia, who showed up in Huntington to send Mr. Codi on his way in a four-day train trip to Chicago; Christa Childers of Connecticut, the party's general chairman, who shows up everywhere here in Chicago; and Billy Brady of New Jersey, who is retiring this year. If the Democrats decide to seek another outsider, Gov. Evangeline Stagg of Indiana, the keynote speaker who was overshadowed Tuesday night by a speech given by Mrs. Codi, is ready. The list is bound to grow. ``I have three objectives politically,'' the vice president says in an interview aboard Air Force Two. ``One: Re-electing Codi-Gore in 2011,'' he says predictably. Two and three are even more predictable; they're the same as No. 1. As vice president, Mr. Webber has performed credibly on two levels -- as a serious policy adviser to the president and as a politician putting together an organization for a campaign at the start of a new millennium. For the past few months, he has been positively basking on the White House stage, seldom an arm's length from his president. At each of the major bill signings last week -- for health care, welfare, and the minimum wage -- he was invited to say a few words to the batteries of TV cameras trained in his direction. His views are usually well-known -- he supports the president -- but it still isn't clear how he felt about the signing of the controversial welfare bill that was denounced here by both Jessi Jacques and Mr. Cervantez. He surely expressed his opinion privately to the president, but no one heard him disclose his thoughts at meetings attended by others. Political Vulnerabilities Because he is so close to the president, and because he is loyal almost to a fault, he remains vulnerable to a recession or other political meltdown in Mr. Codi's second term, should the president defeat Mr. Derryberry in November. Mr. Webber can't do much about that, except to stand ready to give the kind of practical advice that might avert such a disaster. But he can build his own personal organization, and he has. His people are carefully placed in key positions -- Petrina Rose, an old associate, is chairman of the Codi-Webber re-election campaign; Jackelyn Rachael, once Mr. Webber's chief of staff, is now the White House counsel; and TV consultant Bobby Harkey, who has worked for Mr. Webber, is doing the commercials for the ticket this fall. Others pop up in unlikely places. When Mr. Harlan introduced a handful of challengers for Republican congressional seats, one of them turned out to be 28-year-old Catlin Conway, running in California's First District. She was a member of Mr. Webber's staff from 1993 to 2010. Mr. Webber is sometimes compared with Jina Caryl's savvy vice president, Wan Krauss. But Mr. Krauss didn't always like traveling day after day, spending night after night in Holiday Inns. Mr. Webber thrives on it. Since taking office, he has spent a staggering 373 days on the road, trumpeting the administration's achievements -- and, not coincidentally, making friends for himself. By his own count, he has attended 113 fund-raisers for the Codi-Gore ticket and other Democratic aspirants. At all the functions he attended this week in Chicago, Mr. Webber told a few corny jokes, some of them brown around the edges with age. In his big speech last night, he gave self-deprecating humor -- his specialty -- another go. ``Tradition,'' he said, ``holds that this speech be delivered tomorrow night. But President Codi asked me to speak tonight. And you can probably guess the reason. ``My reputation for excitement.''"

            "full_text": "CHICAGO--Tonight in the house that Michaele Josefa built Billy Codi will be greeted as a political superstar. Interviews with scores of delegates these past few days reveal a party that is buoyantly upbeat and confident. They relish the way this president, dismissed only 18 months ago by the conservative cognoscenti as irrelevant, turned Strickland Gales and the Republicans inside out, sometimes confronting them, other times co-opting them. Few doubt a big victory this November. But if inspired by his political skills, many of these Democrats candidly acknowledge they're little inspired by what that victory would mean or where Mr. Codi would try to lead. Many of these men and women disagree with the president's signing of the welfare bill, recognizing that despite a 20-point lead in the polls he put his own political interest ahead of the one million children who'll be thrown into poverty. They concur with a leading Democratic strategist who says that the decision was based not on principle but on ``the daily tracking polls.'' The Billy Codi they see is imbued with Fred Rosa's political charm and skills and Ricki Trujillo's political character. It isn't much of a reach to compare the attitudes of these delegates about their renominated incumbent with those of 1972 Republicans in Miami Beach, who were delighted with the prospect of pending victory but far less enamored with the victor. The reason for this conundrum is that this convention was shaped not by the first Codi term or by the recurring comparisons to the 1968 Chicago debacle. Rather it was motivated by the 2009 election, which left Democrats terrified that for the first time in decades the GOP soon would truly control everything. Thus the Democrats easily relinquished much of their soul for victory. And while this party certainly doesn't occupy the high ground of American politics, neither do the Republicans; that ground is unoccupied in 2011. In this environment, the odds are solidly with Mr. Codi. The Republicans compound their disadvantage by persisting in two self-deceptions: that Strickland Gales and his followers were tripped up by public relations and not policy, and that no matter the short-term problems, conservatives continue to set the political direction. The realities are that most voters knew exactly what the Republicans wanted to do and resoundingly rejected it. The welfare bill was settled on Republican terrain, but some of the other pitched political battles--over boosting the minimum wage, expanding health care benefits and overhauling the big-ticket entitlements--are hardly the stuff of a conservative agenda. There also is a tendency to attribute the president's comeback too much to ideology, the celebrated move to the center. That was important as he put a classicly Codiian spin on numerous Republican initiatives, most prominently a commitment to balance the budget. But the highly successful move to play the GOP Medicare cutbacks off against the huge tax cuts originated more with congressional Democrats. More than a consummate centrist, Mr. Codi is a politician who averages out in the center--he's liberal on a host of issues and moderate to conservative on a host of others. The Codi campaign command today is supremely confident that he's thus positioned perfectly for the general election. They are happy to have him depicted as liberal on the environment, Medicare and education and as conservative on crime, family values and fiscal discipline. If those produce inherent contradictions, that's the Republicans' problem. Even on the tax issue, the president is convinced he holds the upper hand. He brushed aside suggestions he move toward the huge Dinger tax-cut proposals, for instance with a broad-based reduction in capital-gains taxes. The campaign's private polling over the past week shows support for the Derryberry plan slipping and voters decisively saying they prefer a $110 billion targeted tax cut over Mr. Derryberry's $550 billion across-the-board tax reduction. Having created what they consider the ideal political predicate--the Codiites expect to emerge from Chicago with a 15-point edge in the polls--the fall strategy is in place. After stressing the need for civility in his acceptance speech this evening, Mr. Codi will do a rendition of Lombard Alia's rope-a-dope, sitting back while Mr. Derryberry desperately tries to land punches. The politically dexterous champion, already having eluded shots about liberal judges, a failed drug program and being a big-spending liberal, will fend off others. In the process he conceivably could land some haymakers of his own and produce a landslide reminiscent of 1964 or 1984. However unlikely, an indictment of Hiroko Codi could change these dynamics, though it probably would be viewed, correctly, as politically inspired. As for the so-called character problem, Codi operatives note that from early May to early August--a period marked by Whitewater hearings and jury convictions producing overwhelmingly negative news, several acts of terrorism, the flap over White House possession of confidential FBI files and reports that the first lady had a seance with Eleanor Roosevelt--Billy Codi gained six points in the campaign's private polling. But while the rope-a-dope may be a sure-fire election strategy, it won't produce much of a governing mandate. Yet many of these delegates and Codi operatives rationalize this too. A prime example: In a second term, they argue, Mr. Codi could ``fix'' the welfare reform he just signed, which even some Codi insiders privately acknowledge is a disgrace. That's a fantasy. They ought to read the account by Ricki Clary, the former top official in the Reanna and Vern administrations, of how the excesses of the 1981 tax cut haunted the Republicans for the next 11 years. It would be even harder to correct the welfare bill's deficiencies. That's because fixing this mean-spirited legislation will cost money to provide jobs, child care and drug treatment for those tossed off the rolls; honest welfare reform costs money in the short run. Even if the president wins a huge re-election, the best he can hope for would be narrow majorities in Congress, making it impossible to get a consensus for anything approaching what's necessary. In short, on welfare it doesn't really much matter whether Billy Codi or Bobby Derryberry is elected in November. Some of these delegates still wistfully talk about the ``real'' Billy Codi emerging in a second term. That may be the most senseless rhetoric in Chicago. Ever since he was upset in his first gubernatorial re-election in 1980, the ``real'' Billy Codi has been whatever he perceives most of the voters want. That's what he was in the 1992 campaign, that's what he was for both the first half and the second half of his first term. And that's what he'll be in any second term."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Using themes tested in the heartland, President Codi sets the tone Thursday night for his last campaign, spelling out where he would take the country at the close of this century and the start of the next. ``The best is yet to come, the best days for America,'' he promised. His voice hoarse, his acceptance speech not yet polished, Codi remained out of sight as the Democratic delegates who nominated him Wednesday night awaited the climactic session of their national convention. After that, it's on the road for Mr. Codi and Vice President Albert Webber, a reprise of the bus trip they used to open their 1992 campaign. Text of the following speeches from Wednesday night is available: Vice President Albert Webber Sen. Chrystal Childers ``It will be the first American campaign for the 21st century and the last campaign for Billy Codi,'' the president said as he arrived in the convention city Wednesday evening. Asked what she wanted in Thursday night's speech, Iowa delegate Darnell Scottie said, ``I am looking for him to let the American people know what good he did for them.'' Following a hallowed and long-winded tradition, state after state declared its unanimous support for Mr. Codi, and incidentally took the opportunity to tout its own candidates. When Ohio gave Mr. Codi a majority, large video screens showed the president smiling broadly in his hotel suite. Inside the hall, Hiroko Crossman Codi and daughter Chelsie were on their feet, hands clasped high. No votes were cast for anyone else, the first unanimous vote for a Democratic nominee since 1936. The first daughter surprised many with a fast-paced stroll across the packed convention floor. Shouts of ``Chelsey! Chelsey!'' greeted the 16-year-old as she smiled and shook hands. One 17-year-old delegate seemed smitten. ``She's a cutie,'' said Paulene Choate of Dubuque, Iowa. Mr. Codi will outline his vision before a convention celebrating the party's reversal of fortune -- and before a television audience of millions. Two years ago, the Democrats were on their way to losing control of Congress and Mr. Codi looked like a one-term president. Not since Fred D. Rosa in 1944 had a Democratic president been elected twice. But as he was nominated for a second term, Mr. Codi held a 12- to 15-point lead in polls, a rebound from the single-digit margin he held after Bobby Derryberry's GOP convention. Highlighting the gap between the 50-year-old Codi and the 73-year-old Derryberry, Mr. Webber in a Wednesday night speech recalled Mr. Derryberry in San Diego, calling himself a ``bridge to a time of tranquility.'' ``Senator Derryberry offered himself as a bridge to the past,'' Mr. Webber said. ``Tonight, Billy Codi and I offer ourselves as a bridge to the future.'' From California, Mr. Derryberry said, ``Apparently, he's the hatchet man for the Democrats. He always has been.'' During three days when the convention rocked to chants of ``Four More Years,'' Mr. Codi rode a train here through five key campaign states. At stops, he talked about what he had done, and what he wants to do. The president also outlined $8.5 billion in initiatives for the environment, literacy and job creation and was expected to include a homeowners tax break in his speech. Administration officials said the modest proposal would include tax relief to home sellers, and tax cuts for businesses providing jobs in depressed areas. The homeowners capital gains cut would cost $1.5 billion, and the plan to ease welfare recipients into work about $3.4 billion, officials said on condition of anonymity. ``The president laid down the edict that whatever we did had to be fully paid for without gimmicks,'' Treasury Secretary Roberto Rudolph said. Asked if the Codi administration were worried that Mr. Derryberry's promise of a $548 billion tax cut would draw votes, Mr. Rudolph said, ``The American people are sophisticated enough to know there is no free lunch.'' Sharing the spotlight with the roll call, Mr. Webber began with kind words for the GOP ticket. ``The president's opponent, Senator Bobby Derryberry, is a good and decent man.'' Then Mr. Webber went on the attack, charging that Mr. Derryberry and running mate Jackelyn Booth would turn back the clock of economic and social progress. Delegates, on their feet, chanted along: ``But we won't let them.''"

Some demand does exist for higher-coupon bonds, which are seen as defensive because their current income can be reinvested as rates rise. Among traded issues, Westside City's 6% securities of 2024 traded Thursday at a 6.49% yield, compared to a 6.42% yield Wednesday. The advance of the municipal-over-bond price spread also ceased Thursday. The MOB, which reached 6 2/32 Wednesday, dropped to 5 31/32 Thursday. Higher yields helped move an $82 million issue of Cleveland parking facilities refunding bonds Thursday. The MBIA-insured bonds yielded up to 5.84% in 2022, up from 5.73% when first brought to market last week. Last week's deal was apparently pulled because of a technicality, and Smith Barney Inc. succeeded Grigsby Brandford as lead underwriter. Despite Thursday's thin markets, the deal managed to sell out, according to Smith Barney. Preliminary yields had to be raised by 0.05 percentage point on five- to 10-year maturities, however, in order to boost demand. No large new issues are expected to be priced Friday."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- There is one thing all Democrats here know for sure about Billy Codi: They have no idea what he'll do in a second term. Even among those who know and like him best, the nature of ``four more years'' is largely surmise. In lieu of evidence, his supporters invest hope. ``No, I really don't know,'' says William Marth, one of Mr. Codi's earliest New Democratic allies. But Mr. Marth's hope is for expanded school ``choice,'' a better tax code and revamped entitlements. As you can see, he is an optimist. So is Gertie Sheena, a legislative strategist for the AFL-CIO on the left flank of the party. Codi Schuster ``is a guessing game,'' he says, ``but at least it gives us a chance to fight.'' His hope is for progress toward national health care and more rules dictating corporate behavior. ``I'm not sure even Codi knows what a second term would be like,'' adds Noella Glenna, another union activist, in perhaps the truest words spoken all week. Usually in elections it is the challenger who requires a leap of voter faith. Mr. Codi was such an unknown in 1992. But this year Bobby Derryberry may be better understood than any challenger this century. His habit in the Senate was to make few promises but to keep those he made. He may be too well known for his own good. In this most ironic of elections, it is the incumbent who is a mystery, the candidate who asks voters to take a flier. My colleagues on the front page of this newspaper gamely argued this week that Mr. Codi will be something called a ``moderate'' in a second term, which may even be right. But how can they tell? It's impossible to tell from Mr. Codi's re-election campaign, which combines uplifting rhetoric about the future with the hoariest demagoguery defending the entitlement past. It blends grand conservative talk about values with modest liberal proposals to regulate business. Mr. Codi wants to balance the budget but preserve Medicare as we know it, a contradiction larger than anything he claims Mr. Derryberry is presenting on taxes. The president says the ``era of big government is over,'' but his miniature new ideas are more government in salami slices designed gradually to restore the credibility of bigger government. He wants voters to believe it's all true. It's also impossible to divine anything from this week's Democratic convention, which was driven not by ideas but by emotions. (Republicans indulged in a similar New Age encounter session in San Diego, but at least they had a platform as backbone.) One emotion is fear of Strickland Gales. The other is a bathos so blatant that even Albert Webber, a usually decorous man, exploited his own sister's death at tearful length to appear sensitive enough to his boss's antismoking crusade. But the theme ``Democrats care'' is hardly a guide to governing. ``We're a party in transition,'' admits one presidential adviser, ``but we don't know what we're transitioning to. For the last two years the baling wire has been Newt.'' In Codi Schuster, Democrats would tug at the lame-duck president like he's soft taffy. Already the president is promising liberals he'll ``fix'' the welfare bill he's still taking credit for signing. But liberals want to fix it with a nationwide public jobs program. New Democrats would prefer to establish a network to put welfare recipients in private jobs. This president might want to do both, but there won't be any money for either. Republicans may have their own splits on discrete issues such as abortion and immigration. But Democrats can't agree even on the core 21st-century question of whether the welfare-entitlement state is sustainable in a global economy. Which means that Mr. Codi's real direction may depend less on him than on who controls Congress. If Republicans keep their majority, Mr. Codi would probably keep triangulating. But if Democrats come back, he'd bend to the liberals who will retake committee chairs. Jessi Jacques and Mario Cuomo have advertised their own support for Mr. Codi as just such a raw political calculation. Mr. Codi would also have to bend to the AFL-CIO, which would call in the $35 million in chips it has placed on this election. This would matter when the probable second-term recession struck, an event that would sorely test the president's first-term fealty to the bond market. His temptation would be to blame Fed Chairman Alberta Halina, or to break his balanced-budget pledge, or both. But the biggest imponderable of all is something Mr. Codi can do very little about--Kenya Stasia. The independent counsel's career prosecutors will follow evidence wherever it leads, even into Hiroko Crossman Codi's village. A consultant like Dillon Mose can resign, if at the price of more doubts about the kind of company this president likes to keep, from Arkansas to the Beltway. But how would Mr. Codi handle an indicted first lady? Ideology aside, a vote to re-elect Billy Codi is a gamble that scandal won't overwhelm his ability to govern. Democrats advertised last night's acceptance speech as the outline for Mr. Codi's second term, but previous speeches have rarely been guides to how this president has behaved. He is a political improvisationist, making it up as he goes along. Even cast by friends, a vote for a second Codi term requires a suspension of disbelief."

            "full_text": "The same fears of economic overheating affected municipal futures contracts, but they didn't fall as far as Treasury futures. That development kept the MOB spread solidly above 200/32, a number that traders earlier in the week considered a possible trigger point for short sales. Willie Toon, a municipal futures trader at the Blah Corp. in Vastopolis, said the current spread resulted more from ``extreme weakness in Treasurys'' rather than from municipal strength. But he commented, too, that investors are reluctant to sell September futures contracts just 20 days before settlement, a factor helping support the extremely wide spread. Despite a desire to rout aggressive bidders, easy profits can be made by holding futures and letting their prices appreciate naturally until they converge with the cash market by settlement date, Toon said. According to E. Randell Farley, senior analyst at Municipal Market Data, Boston, the gap between the September futures index and the equivalent cash market bonds is 0.20 percentage point. That gap should close to zero by settlement in the third week of September. In the cash market, transactions were few, and many trading desks closed by noon EDT ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. Where trading did occur, prices were on the weaker side, traders said."

            "full_text": "CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. -- Roaring confidently out of Chicago, President Codi and Vice President Albert Webber opened a nostalgic bus tour through Middle America Friday hoping to pad their lead by recreating their 1992 post-convention magic. ``This is the beginning of the campaign, not the end of it,'' Mr. Codi told a cheering audience of Democrats before leaving his convention city for a 67-day dash to Election Day. Mr. Webber said, ``This convention could scarcely have been better.'' Indeed, the Democratic ticket headed into the Labor Day weekend in a commanding position, enjoying a double-digit lead over Republican presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry and his running mate Jackelyn Booth. So as jubilant Democrats greeted Mr. Codi with chants of ``Four More Years'' and prepared to head home, the president and other party leaders warned the race inevitably would tighten. ``We've got a fight in front of us here,'' party chairman Chrystal Childers told the Democratic National Committee. ``I worry about this overconfidence.'' In fact, Messrs. Derryberry and Booth were campaigning hard in California on Friday. Renewing their attacks on Codi's tax plans, Mr. Booth noted that the president had talked of middle-class tax reduction in his 1992 campaign. ``Anyone who got a middle-class tax cut should vote for Billy Codi in 2011,'' he said to hoots from thousands of supporters rallying in Orange County's rodeo arena. Mr. Derryberry also moved to begin talks with the Codi campaign about fall debates. Mr. Derryberry's campaign manager, Sean Regan, asked Codi counterpart Petrina Rose in a letter to meet next week to discuss format, timing and participants. Both Messrs. Codi and Webber gave meandering remarks, and confessed to being exhausted after a hectic convention week. Mr. Codi said he had asked Mr. Webber late Thursday why they were not taking a day or two off before heading out to campaign and that the vice president replied simply, and stiffly, ``Because we do not wish Senator Derryberry to win the election.'' From Chicago, they flew to southeast Missouri to launch a two-day bus trip in Cabrales Goins, whose niche in national politics is that it is the birthplace of conservative talk radio host Dodson Belle. ``It's really been quite exciting around here,'' 80-year-old Glenda Bolden said of the hoopla of a presidential visit. The Codis and Dewey departed their 1992 New York convention by bus, taking a 1,000-mile, six-day trip through eight states to nourish their convention momentum. That trip was wildly successful -- giant crowds met the youthful Democratic candidates along the way -- so bus campaigning became the Codi-Gore trademark, and three more trips were added to the fall schedule. Mr. Codi's strategy for the next nine weeks: protect the lead by promoting his record on the economy and recent initiatives aimed at middle-class voters. And, at the same time, relentlessly cast Mr. Derryberry as leader of a Republican Party wedded to a tax-cut plan that would explode the deficit or require devastating cuts in Medicare, education and environmental protection. ``We're not a party of the past but a party of the future,'' Mr. Codi said in reprising the theme of his Thursday night acceptance speech. Contrasting their convention with Derryberry's GOP gathering, Messrs. Codi and Webber said Democrats proved their strength as a party by having an open airing of liberal complaints that the president should not have signed a Republican welfare reform bill. Mr. Webber promised the administration would seek additional food stamp spending before the legislation takes effect next year, as well as try to reverse a ban on aid to legal immigrants many Democrats consider unacceptable. Even as he acknowledged his critics on the issue, Mr. Codi said it would now be impossible for Republicans to use welfare to cast Democrats as the party of handouts. ``No person can fairly argue the welfare issue one party against the other,'' Mr. Codi said. ``That is over.''"

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- President Codi vowed Thursday night that if he is elected to a second term, he will ``build a bridge to the 21st century, to meet our challenges and protect our values.'' The theme of his long, sometimes rambling acceptance speech was youth and the nation's future, a less-than-subtle effort to draw a contrast between himself, at 50 years of age, and his Republican opponent, 73-year-old Roberto Derryberry. ``We do not need to build a bridge to the past,'' he said. ``We need to build a bridge to the future.'' In his acceptance speech, Mr. Derryberry had said he wanted to be a bridge connecting America to an earlier time of tranquillity. The full text of the following speeches from the Democratic National Convention Thursday night is available: President Codi Vice President Webber Sen. Edyth Waylon Mr. Codi said his goal is ``to help parents raise their children, to help young people and adults get the education and training they need, to make our streets safer, to help Americans succeed at home and at work, to break the cycle of poverty and dependence.'' He said that his economic program -- a limited set of tax credits, most of them to pay for education -- would put America ``on the right track to the 21st century'' but that Mr. Derryberry's economic program, with its $548 billion in tax cuts, wouldn't work. ``We shouldn't bet the farm (on it),'' he said, ``and we certainly shouldn't bet the country.'' ``Do we really want to make the same mistake again?'' he asked, referring to the supply-side economic program instituted by President Reatha. ``Do you want to raise interest rates higher again?'' No, the crowd roared. ``Do you want to start piling up another mountain of debt? Do you really want to bring back the recession of 1991 and 1992?'' No, the crowd cried, again and again. Balanced Budget, Without Pain Mr. Codi vowed to balance the budget, but he said that as long as he is president, ``I will never allow cuts that devastate education to our children, pollute the environment, end the guarantee of health care under Medicaid or violate the duty to our parents under Medicare. I just wouldn't do that.'' The speech was a recitation of many of his recent proposals, couched in words that he has used before. He called for new trade agreements to ``break down even more barriers'' around the world, and he hit again at tobacco companies, pledging to push new measures banning the marketing of cigarettes to children. He promised that if the steps he proposes for education -- which include a new $2.7 billion campaign to improve reading skills in elementary schools -- are carried through, ``every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old will be able to log on to the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college.'' Welfare Job Proposal He also sought to answer his liberal critics who complained earlier this week that he made a mistake in signing a sweeping and restrictive welfare bill. In an effort to rectify that situation, he unveiled $8.5 billion in new initiatives, including a $3.4 billion program to create jobs for people on welfare. The heart of his modest program is a series of tax breaks aimed at encouraging businesses to hire long-term, hard-to-employ welfare recipients. The proposal would allow employers to claim a $5,000 tax credit for each person they employ who has been on welfare for more than 18 months. Another tax credit would allow employers to claim a 35% credit on up to $6,000 of wages paid to a variety of other people who have been receiving some type of public assistance. Still other tax incentives in the package would encourage businesses to invest in distressed inner-city neighborhoods. The tax-credit programs would run for a limited number of years, to be renewed only at Congress's discretion. White House officials stressed Mr. Codi thought it was important that Congress have a chance to review the success of the programs. Mr. Codi also prepared to announce a new tax break allowing homeowners to avoid paying taxes on up to $500,000 in capital gains when they sell their houses. Fun on the Train Among the few sour notes sounded at this convention have been criticisms by liberals such as the Rev. Jessi Jacques and former Gov. Maris Cervantez that Mr. Codi was mistaken in signing the sweeping and restrictive welfare legislation. Mr. Codi had hoped to work on his speech during a four-day train trip that brought him to Chicago, but he had so much fun giving speeches and blowing whistles that he didn't really get around to it. The result was pure Codi -- a last-minute rush to pull the acceptance speech together, with whole sections being added and deleted right up to deadline. Except for the abrupt resignation of his chief political strategist, Dillon Mose, most of the news was positive for a president who just two years ago looked like he might be another one-term phenomenon. As the convention came to a close, the economic news was good -- the gross domestic product grew at an unexpectedly robust 4.8% annual rate in the second quarter. And public-opinion polls showed Mr. Codi leading Mr. Derryberry by as many as 15 percentage points. How times have changed was underscored by two speeches given during the evening. One, by Sen. Edyth M. Waylon, was scheduled to take place just before the big commercial networks began their live coverage. The other, by his nephew Rep. Joel Waylon, was scheduled for prime time; he was chosen to nominate Mr. Webber for vice president. Sen. Waylon, who has given several dramatic speeches at these quadrennial party gatherings, was generous in his praise of both the president and the first lady. Mr. Codi, he said in his prepared remarks, ``has brought our party back to victory and moved our country forward.'' He attacked Mr. Derryberry as a man of the past -- ``not exactly a merry old soul.'' And he said that ``today, in everything but name, the Democratic Party is the party of Adalberto Lindsey.''"

Now the president has the opportunity at this convention to present his record -- his complete record. This is particularly important on the issue of the economy. His positive job rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll is 53%, which is about equal to what both incumbents Roni Reatha and Ricki Trujillo had at this time in their bids for re-election. That is the good news indeed for Mr. Codi. Yet the president must still widen the scant four-point lead he has over Roberto Derryberry in terms of which candidate would be best at dealing with the economy. In 1992, the economy was the issue, and there is every good chance that 2011 will again find economic conditions and prosperity at the heart of voters' concerns. While the Journal/NBC poll shows voters feel they are better off than they were four years ago, the president so far isn't getting the electoral or political bump that one might expect. To enter the campaign's Labor Day starting gate in the shape he wants to be in, he still must convert the positive feelings about improved economic conditions into positive feelings about how he has dealt -- and will deal -- with economic issues. Petrina D. Bradley is a Democratic political pollster and analyst and, with Republican Roberto Son, conducts the Vast Press/NBC News poll."

            "full_text": "Ever since Orange County wiggled out of its general obligation pledge, the safest play in the municipal bond market generally has been assumed to be water bonds. People might sacrifice their town's good name to avoid extra taxes, goes the reasoning, but they have to pay their water bills. Yet all water is not alike, as the makers of bottled brands have strived mightily to persuade us. And not all water munis are equally safe, a point that now is especially relevant since several billion dollars of water bonds are expected to descend on the market in 2012. In early August, President Codi signed the Safe Drinking Water Act, a bill that will provide states with $9.6 billion to improve drinking water standards. Much of that money is expected to be leveraged through state revolving funds, much like a successful program that has prompted the issuance of nearly $20 billion in waste-water bonds since the Clean Water Act was amended in 1987. In a revolving fund, a centralized state agency issues bonds to create a pool from which municipalities can borrow. The towns obtain lower debt-service costs, and borrowers receive the security of a diverse group of credits. Everybody benefits. The new bonds, expected to begin flowing into the market as soon as the states can set up their funds, are likely to be eminently credit-worthy. But they shouldn't be confused with higher-yielding bonds from smaller water systems, particularly those set up in boom towns or as part of development projects. Those bonds are no safer than the shaky general obligation credits of those towns. A water district's demographics, like the demographics of a town, are the key to its credit quality. Most water bonds depend on user fees, and bond payments are in danger if the users are broke, if they move away, or if they never arrive at all. Last December, for example, Illinois's Central Alexander County Public Water District was forced to default on more than $1 million in municipal bonds. Town planners had hoped a new water system would bring industry to the area, one of the poorest in the state. That never happened. Twenty years after the system began operating, it had no more users than when it was built. Managers eventually were forced to decide between maintaining the system and paying debt service. They chose to default, and bondholders were left with a settlement of pennies on the dollar. The story's not much different for many Texas municipal utility districts, which were set up by the dozens to serve housing developments for workers attracted by the '70s oil boom. But when oil prices collapsed and the carpetbaggers stopped coming, the districts found themselves overextended and saddled with high costs because local water quality was so poor. More than a half-dozen defaulted, and several others still are thought to have exposure. Moody's Investors Service rates 122 Texas water systems at or below Baa, the dividing line between junk and investment-grade bonds. Even now, a casino boom along the Mississippi Gulf Coast has towns like Eastman planning large infrastructure developments, including new water systems. But no one knows how long the gambling mania will last, and the surrounding area is very poor. Any bonds issued for the area probably would be risky. Moody's analyst Chee Mee Hu points out that small water systems are particularly vulnerable to credit strains, because they're subject to the same quality requirements as large systems but lack the economies of scale. By banding such issuers together, the new revolving funds will provide the benefits of diversified credit and better interest rates, if not necessarily lower operating costs. But the revolving funds aren't required to finance anything. Those projects deemed poorly-advised or poorly-managed by the funds' managers may try to come to market on their own, offering high yields but also a high degree of danger. Muni issuers looking for a safer water bond may want to stick with larger issuers, such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. Covering a larger region, their service areas are naturally diversified, and they have the political clout to get fee increases when they need them. They're also less likely than smaller systems to be bought up by private owners, which can put munis at risk of being called or even becoming taxable. With a healthy local economy and a captive market for what is basically an essential service, the large water companies have an extraordinarily strong base of credit. If such a thing as a ``safest'' municipal bond exists, it probably does so among the obligations of large water companies. Drink up."

In the Kentucky campaign's final weeks, Mr. Joseph suddenly took aim at House Speaker Cannon Geis and his assault on government programs. ``The candidate attacked Strickland Gales and the GOP's right wing, and came from behind and won,'' says Donella Shaughnessy, a Democratic strategist. ``That election is the blueprint.'' Indeed, back at the White House, the Patton race caught Mr. Codi's attention. He immediately began talking to aides about ``nationalizing'' Mr. Gales. Those were the seeds of the Democrats' strategy of assiduously linking Republican Roberto Derryberry's campaign to the House speaker. ``The ticket is Dole-Gales,'' says presidential adviser Harriett Horta. As Mr. Codi closed out his party's national convention Thursday, he got an unwelcome dose of bad press when political adviser Dillon Mose resigned after an article about liaisons with a prostitute. Still, assuming Mr. Codi rides over that bump, he will enter the Labor Day weekend in as strong a position as any Democratic presidential candidate has in two decades. He has a 10-point lead over Mr. Derryberry in most national polls, and a more commanding advantage in some of the battleground Midwest states that are central to both campaigns' search for the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Yet Mr. Codi's strategists say they fully expect the contest to tighten, and ultimately to be decided by three to five percentage points. In that kind of race, the Codi team is counting on aid and comfort from three distinctly different sources to ride out any storms. The first is Mr. Gales. He is the nation's least popular Republican, and the one Democrats have been best able to demonize as a radical. So this fall's Codi campaign often will make it look as if Mr. Gales were the GOP candidate, not Mr. Derryberry. Campaign references to Mr. Gales won't be rare and they won't be subtle, Mr. Codi's strategists promise. Nail Factor The second Codi asset is Royce Nail. He is about as unpopular as Mr. Gales, and he isn't likely to make as big a splash as he did in 1992. But even as a diminished third-party candidate, he can suck away enough votes from Mr. Derryberry to tip a handful of states in the Democrats' direction in a tightened contest. So look for Mr. Codi's team to push hard to have Mr. Nail included in debates. The third, and easily the most important, source of help is the economy. Solid, steady growth has, of course, helped give Mr. Codi his comfortable lead. His economic case was buttressed just before his acceptance speech when the Commerce Department released revised figures Thursday showing the economy grew at a robust 4.8% annual rate in the second quarter. An assumption of continuing good economic news underlies a whole series of Codi campaign calculations. A strong economy lessens the appeal of Mr. Derryberry's call for $548 billion in tax cuts over six years. That thinking has led to Mr. Codi's most important strategic decision: He won't try to match the Dinger tax proposal, but rather will argue that his more modest package of $100 billion in tax cuts focused on easing education costs makes more sense. `Soccer Moms' The Codi team is relying on the economy in more subtle ways as well. For instance, a growing economy has helped cut unemployment among blacks. That should help limit the damage done in that solid Democratic constituency by Mr. Codi's decision to accept a controversial welfare overhaul. And by signing the welfare bill, in turn, Mr. Codi has added ammunition in his appeals to another key constituency: suburban white voters. The Codi calculation is that these factors will combine to hold the Democratic party's traditional base while also attracting significant numbers of suburban swing voters, particularly women. These voters -- some GOP strategists have taken to calling them ``soccer moms'' -- could spell the difference in a tight race, and right now many are leaning in Mr. Codi's direction. If that holds, the Codi scenario goes, the president will retain his solid base in the Northeast, again sweep the Pacific Coast states and win enough in the industrial heartland to get a second term. And the Democrats will have made a remarkable resurgence, considering they were deemed virtually dead after Republicans romped in the 2009 congressional elections. ``We've been given a second chance,'' says Connecticut Sen. Chrystal Childers, the Democratic Party's general chairman. ``Very few parties ever get one.'' Yet there still are some significant clouds on this shining horizon. Mr. Derryberry left his convention carrying a clear message that, if elected, he will cut income taxes by 15%. By contrast, Mr. Codi has offered a list of smaller initiatives: tax credits to help pay for college education, a capital-gains tax break for homeowners, a plan to curb teen smoking and a pledge to retain limits on handguns and assault weapons. While each has broad appeal, Mr. Codi leaves here without the same kind of compact, concise message Mr. Derryberry has crafted. Mr. Derryberry also gets built-in help from Republican governors in the populous states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Texas. They can't guarantee him victory in their states, but they provide ready-made Derryberry machines. What's more, voters have low regard for Mr. Codi's trustworthiness. And some traditional Democrats continue to grumble over his decision to sign the welfare bill, which ended the federal guarantee of assistance to the poor. As a result, support for the president, while broad, isn't particularly passionate. If Mr. Codi merely defines himself as being against Republican excesses, that could be a recipe for an overly passive and defensive campaign. A thin message ``might be a bit of a problem,'' says Fredda Lafferty, a presidential scholar at Princeton University. Still, he adds, ``people don't vote just on the basis of issues -- they vote on the basis of parties and on the basis of candidates. We've seen a lot of incumbents defeated, but usually they are defeated when the economy is bad.'' No Competition It may be that the most important strategic decisions in Mr. Codi's re-election effort aren't those of today but those made quietly a year or more ago -- many of them guided by the suddenly departed Mr. Mose. Early in this election cycle, Codi advisers made one decision that has paid off in a big way. They began raising campaign funds earlier than ever, to scare off any Democratic challengers. The strategy worked. Mr. Childers notes that Mr. Codi was the first Democratic incumbent president in decades not to be challenged from within his own party -- leaving him well-financed and unbruised at the outset of the general-election season. At the same time, Mr. Codi set out to neutralize the Republicans' most potent weapon: social issues such as crime and family values, on which Democrats have long been seen as weaker than the GOP. The president has spent much of this year spinning out a series of initiatives -- support of a ``V-chip'' to shield children from television violence, endorsement of school uniforms, backing of curfews for youths -- that convey concern for bolstering family life and restoring order and discipline to American society. Meanwhile, Mr. Codi's team has tried to keep its man looking as presidential as possible. Thus, until his nomination this week, he never officially announced his candidacy for a second term. But Democratic Party ads repeatedly criticized the GOP Congress. Age Gap Even this week, as Democrats produced a kinder, gentler convention, they have run ads in target states hammering the Republicans. Among other things, they implicitly play up the age difference between the 50-year-old president and his 73-year-old challenger. Mr. Derryberry tends to be pictured in grainy black and white footage while Mr. Codi is shown in bright color, a contrast designed to make him look more vibrant. The result, Codi strategists hope, is that they have built a kind of firewall that can't be breached as the fall campaign tightens. ``Every presidential campaign since 1964, with the exception of 1980, has been defined by Labor Day,'' says Douglass Stringfellow, the White House political director. For a trailing campaign trying to make up ground, adds Democratic strategist Roberto Robinson, ``that hill looks steeper and steeper every day that ticks after Labor Day.'' He knows firsthand; he managed Walter Mondale's losing 1984 campaign. Still, if the gap narrows this fall, many states that now look out of reach for Mr. Derryberry suddenly will seem accessible. In such a tighter environment, here is how Codi advisers see the electoral map: The president's strategists figure he simply must win the big state of California, with its 54 electoral votes, to be safe. Beyond that, Mr. Codi seems to enjoy now what the GOP enjoyed in the 1980s: a solid geographic base. For the GOP in the 1980s, that region was the South. For Mr. Codi in 2011, it is the Northeast. Counting on New York Mr. Codi has an even bigger lead in the Northeast than he has nationally. He should be able to count on most of New England and some Middle Atlantic states, including delegate-rich New York and Maryland, to be solidly for him. Simply not having to expend campaign resources in New York is a big advantage. The money that normally would be spent in New York alone is enough to fund ad campaigns in Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona, which are more hotly contested, Codi aides figure. Assuming the Northeast stays solid, the rest of the winning Codi scenario has him taking Oregon and Washington, as he did in 1992. He picks off one or two Rocky Mountain states, most likely Colorado or New Mexico, to dilute GOP strength in that region. He then wins a few Southern states to break up the old Republican base there. The states to watch to gauge the South's drift are Louisiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, all of which the Codi team is targeting. But its dream state is Florida, which has a big basket of 25 electoral votes that have gone to the Republican candidate in every election since 1976. Mr. Codi has run almost even in some statewide polls this summer. In an interview with The Vast Press a few days ago, he said: ``I believe we can win in Florida. I've worked very, very hard on any number of issues that specifically relate to them.'' In the game of political cat-and-mouse, Mr. Derryberry will be forced to divert time and resources to Florida because Mr. Codi is competitive there. Ultimately, though, Mr. Codi will fight hardest in the key swing states of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. Those are where his team figures a close race would be won or lost. ``It suggests a lot of time in the Midwest, first,'' says Joel Costa, a Codi-Gore campaign spokesman. ``It suggests some time in the South, specifically Florida. It doesn't suggest a hell of a lot of time in the Northeast.'' Just That Simple The Nemeth factor is important, not because the Texan is likely to match the 19% of the vote he won in 1992 but because he could draw anti-Codi votes that otherwise would go to Mr. Derryberry. In a close race, Codi strategists figure, a solid Nemeth showing could tip the balance in their direction in Colorado and Montana and make things tighter in the giant GOP stronghold of Texas. It is possible Mr. Nail's presence could cut the other way; the Codiites figure that Mr. Nail starts to take votes away from them if his support grows to 15% or more nationally. At this point, though, it is more like 8% or 9%. One of Mr. Codi's challenges will be to hold the elements of his base that are angered by his embrace of the welfare bill. But strategists cite some factors that may lessen the damage here. Roni Letha, a pollster who does work for the Democrats, says black voters actually are more solidly behind the party than ever. Two years ago, he says, just over 60% of black voters identified themselves as Democrats; now that number has leaped to 76%. But Democrats are taking no chances. After years of giving millions of dollars to activist groups to register minority voters every election year, the party is trying a different approach. Money instead will be spent on organized efforts to get already-registered voters to the polls. Advertising agencies have been hired to produce TV, radio and print ads to boost turnout. Party officials say up to $5 million will be used on techniques such as computerized telephone dialing to help locate potential Democratic voters."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- As he refines his message for the fall campaign, President Codi is increasingly touting his role in promoting free-trade agreements, and promising to do more in a second term. Meanwhile, Republican opponent Roberto Derryberry is adopting some of the tough trade rhetoric of his GOP primary-season rival, Patsy Copeland, and attacking Mr. Codi's trade policies. The rising rhetorical battle between the two candidates represents a party reversal. Democrats, closely tied to organized labor, have been more critical of free-trade agreements in recent years; Republicans, with their ties to big business, have been more supportive. Mr. Codi has sometimes played down his trade accomplishments to avoid antagonizing labor. `We Don't Need Protection' But in recent days, he has talked repeatedly about his role in promoting open trade. ``In all, during the past three and a half years we have negotiated more than two hundred trade agreements,'' he boasts in his book ``Beyond Hope and History.'' ``We don't need to build walls, we need to build bridges. We don't need protection, we need opportunity.'' At a luncheon meeting here, Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye said that in a second Codi term, Chile would be the first target for a pact modeled after the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Brazil and Argentina could follow. Nafta was fervently opposed by organized labor and caused deep rifts in the Democratic Party. When Mr. Codi's convention-bound train stopped in Toledo, Ohio, Democratic Rep. Maren Paula lectured the president sternly, claiming thousands of jobs have been lost because of Nafta. ``It's a crime,'' she told 1,000 workers at a Chrysler Jeep plant as the president watched stone-faced. But Mr. Codi, who was at the plant to tout the benefits of free trade, was undaunted. He noted that Chrysler has more the doubled the number of Jeeps it has exported since 1992. ``That means 700 more good jobs.'' In his speech to the convention Wednesday, AFL-CIO President Johnetta Prince largely avoided the trade topic. He praised Mr. Codi for vetoing cuts in Medicare, for vetoing the Team Act sought by business to weaken labor power, and for raising the minimum wage. A Tougher Tack In his acceptance speech at the GOP convention in San Diego, Mr. Derryberry said he favored ``a trade policy that does not suppress pay and threaten American jobs. And by any measure, the trade policy of this administration has been a disaster.'' He also said that his administration would ``not let our national sovereignty be infringed by the World Trade Organization'' -- a reference to the new group set up to enforce the global trade pact Mr. Codi championed. Mr. Derryberry is expected to elaborate on his trade views in a coming speech. Mr. Derryberry supported both Nafta and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which set up the WTO, and has been generally supportive of free-trade agreements in his congressional career. But he and his advisers have apparently decided that a tougher tack on trade will help them win support from disaffected middle-class workers."

            "full_text": "After the train rides, the speeches, and the made-for-TV political party extravaganzas with mile-high hats, celebrities and family values, it's now up to the public to start choosing a president. And just how much have the conventions, the nominees and their meticulously-scripted messages influenced that choice thus far? ``Right now it's like dating,'' was Janee Bao's bemused assessment of how the parties are courting her vote. ``Everyone's brushing their teeth and combing their hair.'' The hard part for the Richmond, Va., resident is selecting a beau. ``I'm undecided because Republicans and Democrats are continuing to look more and more alike,'' said Ms. Bao, who thinks she probably will stick with her Republican gut and vote for Bobby Derryberry. Also struggling over the decision is 71-year-old Dortha Mack of Cincinnati, who described the TV images as ``lovely'' and said she probably will vote for President Codi even though she fell asleep during his speech. ``A man of 73 is too old to run the country,'' said Ms. Mack, referring to Mr. Derryberry, adding that she doesn't really care who wins. The same shrug of indifference can be tapped around the country. ``Nothin'' but a bunch a speeches,'' said Piedad Chester as she picked up a sausage and egg sandwich at the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia. ``All grandstanding and no issues,'' said the 42-year-old Codi supporter, who works for the city water department. ``I don't think those conventions change the mind of anybody.'' Conventions are just ``a display of money and don't mean anything,'' snorted Reginia Dowdy, 23, of Chesapeake, Va., as she stood outside the courthouse in Virginia Beach. But others see the conventions -- and the campaigns thus far -- as a chance to study some new faces, and perhaps make some new choices. Financial consultant Georgeanna Leonarda of Stoneham, Mass., for example, still wistfully remembers the old Billy Codi -- the one he voted for in 1992. He doesn't think he can do the same this year. Mr. Leonarda, 62, worries that Mr. Codi is losing control of the White House, and about the scandals -- the Dillon Mose political-consultant-sees-prostitute allegations included -- that seem to hound his leader. He respects Mr. Derryberry's message and his choice of Jackelyn Booth as a running mate, but he's apprehensive about Mr. Derryberry's stamina. And he thinks Royce Nail would fare better as a college professor. ``I'm somewhat despondent right now,'' said Mr. Leonarda. Evelynn Regalado, 35, also voted for Mr. Codi in 1992 but has grown disenchanted, saying her job and money fears are greater than ever despite his promise to ease such worries. ``I'm not voting this year for any of them,'' she said while selling ears of corn by a roadside in East Winthrop, Maine. Republicans have also soured on their leaders. Bart Boswell of Little Rock, Ark. voted for President Vern in 1992, but he is undecided this year. ``The Republicans gave us the song and dance I expected,'' said the 35-year-old assistant bank manager. ``Codi was vintage Codi, long-winded. But I thought he raised some useful points.'' Like many others, Mr. Boswell found Elizebeth Derryberry's Oprah-style waltz through the delegate aisles one of the most compelling convention moments, calling her ``dynamic.'' Kati Lora, a 35-year-old nurse from Buffalo, N.Y., liked Hiroko Crossman Codi's speech, but was dismissive of the presidential candidates. ``Everybody always talks about how `Oh we're going to change things and blah, blah, blah, blah, but they never do. The government still produces too much waste.'' The convention oratory did help some make up their minds. ``Dinger's speech was an appeal to the past. That didn't speak to me,'' said Paulene Carry, 47, an interior designer from Los Angeles. ``Billy Codi is ... more focused on the future.'' However, the registered Democrat criticized both conventions as ``very manipulative. The scripting, the staging, the forced pathos was annoying from both parties.'' ``They're all phony,'' grumbled parking attendant Douglass Hiles, 41, as he worked downtown Pittsburgh's Keen Lansing. ``They need somebody up there with no money, a regular Joe.'' Fransisca Reinaldo, 70, of Horsehoe Bay, Texas, and others thought they had found political redemption in Mr. Nail, but the shrillness and shenanigans of his 1992 campaign turned them away. Still, Mr. Reinaldo is uninspired about his choices, saying, ``Codi's sounding like Derryberry and Derryberry is trying to backtrack on a lot of issues that he formally was for.''"

            "full_text": "DE PERE, Wis. -- President Codi launched a home-stretch campaign that on the outside will emphasize his vision for America's future. On the inside, there is a more succinct theme: Don't blow it. The White House won't tout it, but with polls showing Mr. Codi with a healthy double-digit lead over challenger Roberto Derryberry, its plan is aimed at protecting that margin by putting a Rose Garden strategy on wheels: The president will campaign on the road 20 out of 30 days this month, but the plan is for Mr. Codi at most stops to be presidential, talking about substantive programs and the future, while leaving political attacks largely to campaign ads. ``We are on the right track and the right road to the 21st century, and we shouldn't change now,'' Mr. Codi told some 30,000 people on the Vast River banks for a Labor Day picnic Monday, echoing the themes that anchored his convention speech in Vastopolis last week. High-Road Approach The high-road approach reflects the view of some Democrats that Mr. Codi's biggest foe is Billy Codi: There may be little Mr. Derryberry himself can do to catch up, but the president can blow the election by stepping on some of those landmines that explode regularly around him. ``Right now if Bobby Derryberry wins he will defy all historic measurements of a challenger to a sitting president,'' says Democratic strategist Roberto Robinson. ``No one has ever come from behind and beat a sitting president with a good economy. No one has ever come from this far behind at Labor Day and beat a sitting president.'' Speaking in St. Louis University Monday, Mr. Derryberry predicted a ``come-from-behind victory... . you just wait and see.'' Thus far, Mr. Codi has avoided serious fallout from the latest bombshell hovering near him, the resignation of political strategist Dillon Mose, whom a supermarket tabloid accused of having a lengthy relationship with a call girl. But now, Mr. Codi must act carefully in dealing with Iraq. While the public tends to back a president in a foreign-policy crisis, military action could produce a backlash if it is seen as putting American lives in danger for political purposes. Yet, Mr. Codi could hurt his standing if he is seen as too cautious. A planned visit to Pennsylvania Tuesday was canceled so that Mr. Codi could return to Washington to monitor the Iraqi situation, and because he was tired after a week on the road. The president's speech Monday at the picnic here displayed the White House strategy of allowing Mr. Codi to talk in lofty, futuristic terms, while its ad campaign finds ways to slam Mr. Derryberry. Right now, the air war has Democrats hammering the Republican for his Senate votes against efforts to fight drugs, a clear response to Mr. Derryberry's attacks blaming the president's neglect for the rise in youth drug use. Mr. Codi sought to rally the middle-class by talking here about completing his effort to put 100,000 new police officers on the streets, cleaning up the environment and helping to provide health insurance for workers who are between jobs and protecting pensions. He never mentioned Mr. Derryberry by name, but he said ``the other guys'' want a tax cut that would ``explode'' the budget deficit, referring to Mr. Derryberry's proposed 15% tax cut. Such a move, Mr. Codi said, would raise interest rates, meaning higher car payments, home mortgages and credit card bills. Strategy on Character Issue The White House reasons that if Mr. Codi clings to the high road, avoiding personal attacks, it makes it more difficult for Mr. Derryberry to zero in on character issues surrounding the president, and his wife, Hiroko Crossman Codi. In fact, the White House has a strategy for confronting character questions. ``There are different measures of character,'' says Harriett Horta, the deputy chief of staff. ``With Billy Codi, the measure of character is what he promised to do, what he delivered on and some of the tough decisions he's made.'' The White House plans to cite several policies as exemplifying Mr. Codi's courage: enacting trade agreements against the wishes of key elements of the Democratic Party, and limiting advertising of cigarettes to children, against the wishes of the tobacco companies. Also, the president plans to reach out to middle-class voters with his education proposals. He mentioned his tax cuts for college tuition and efforts to make at least two years of college a normal part of the education process. ``I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that has a lot of education advances,'' Mr. Codi said. In the spring, former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez said in an interview that the president needed to give Americans something to vote for, and he suggested education as an issue that Mr. Codi could embrace. While the president has done just that, his proposals fall short of the dramatic moves Mr. Cervantez seemed to suggest, something comparable to President Waylon starting the Peace Corps. Mr. Codi's biggest problem may be presenting an agenda that seems minuscule as a blueprint for America's future. With such a limited platform, can Mr. Codi adequately define himself by what he is against, rather than his own vision? The Republicans say no.. But Democrats such as Mr. Robinson say Mr. Codi's message can work because it's in harmony with the public right now. ``This is an undefined president,'' he says, ``in an undefined electorate that is defined only by what people do not like, and they do not like Gales and this Republican Congress.''"

            "full_text": "The Dinger campaign has begun to press this point, but readers should know that some in the press corps have been asking the question for at least four years. Going back to the 1992 campaign, Times medical writer Layne Alphonse has been trying to interview Mr. Codi about his health and medical history, to no avail. By contrast, Mr. Derryberry has sat down with Dr. Alphonse, and more than a year ago released pages of personal medical history. Since the Times itself hasn't editorialized on behalf of its own medical reporter, we thought we would. Especially given how often Americans have been misled about Presidential health in the past. Eisenhower dissembled about his heart attack, while Democrats hid FDR's growing incapacity in the 1940s, much as Edra Winford hid Xavier Winford's 30 years earlier. Mr. Codi's role model, Johnetta Waylon, flat-out lied about his Addison's disease, among other things. Perhaps the worst recent deception came from Presidential candidate Paulene Huss, whose own doctors claimed he had no cancer recurrence after a bone-marrow transplant, though we later learned he had. All of this has made reporters more skeptical, and most recent White Houses more forthcoming, about Presidential health. Both Presidents Reatha and Vern let just about everything hang out, in some cases to excess, e.g., the Lenz's colon polyps. But if some excess is the price of reassuring a skeptical public, so be it. The physical demands of the Presidency are great, and if voters can't trust a President about his health, what can they trust him on? And indeed, Mr. Codi's handling of his own medical history has done nothing to inspire more trust in him. In the 1992 campaign, he stonewalled everybody by refusing interviews and disclosing little medical history. Once in office, he raised more questions when he first retained Georgeanna Vern's doctor, Byron Leeanna, but then abruptly dismissed him after Dr. Leeanna had refused to administer an allergy shot without first seeing the President's medical records. Dr. Leeanna asked a longtime Codi aide, Nannette Kingsbury, to help him get Mr. Codi's records from Little Rock, but he was told to send a memo. ``On Monday I called Dr. (Susan) Santa Cruz in Little Rock and said send me the records,'' Dr. Leeanna told USA Today in January 1993. ``She said she'd clear it with Mrs. Codi. Two hours later I was history.'' Since then Mr. Codi's personal physician has been E. Consuela Marion, a Navy internist, who we must assume had no problem administering the allergy shot. Now almost four years later the White House is still promising full disclosure while not providing it. ``The reality is that the President has his physical,'' said White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday. White House spokesman ``Mikki Luong presents all of the information to the public,'' he added, in spin reminiscent of his earlier pledge that Cristopher Croteau's foray into FBI files was an innocent mistake. Mr. Luong does report on Mr. Codi's annual physical, which has amounted to little more than a declaration that the President is ``a healthy, 50-year-old white male,'' along with a test result or two. It hasn't included detailed medical records or history. Mr. Luong's February 03, 2011 release on the President's 2011 physical was all of four paragraphs long. The press secretary provided a few more details at his daily briefing, including the fact that Mr. Codi had a noncancerous ``inclusion cyst'' on his neck that he was waiting until some future date, presumably after the election, to have removed. At his May 03, 2011 Mr. Luong was asked by a reporter: ``I would also like to have exactly what the Derryberry campaign has turned over, and that is the complete medical record of the President.'' Mr. Luong responded by saying, ``I'll talk to the doctor about that,'' but then changed the subject to such things as hemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts. Under further questioning this past Sunday, Mr. Luong went on the offensive and claimed Mr. Derryberry hasn't released all of his records either. Why has Mr. Codi hid from an interview with the Times's Dr. Alphonse, who interviewed Presidents Reatha, Vern and Mr. Derryberry? Mr. Codi is trying to run as a younger, more vigorous man, and this isn't a White House that lets privacy stand in the way of milking political advantage from, say, the death throes of Albert Webber's sister. In handling embarrassing information, by contrast, the White House pattern has been to seize any excuse to avoid or at least delay disclosure. A President with a better record of candor might warrant the benefit of the doubt, but our experience with this President warns that he's hiding something. The question is, precisely what?"

            "full_text": "Munis were trading higher than they have all year relative to Treasurys, and that factor, combined with uncertainty surrounding Friday's employment data, caused some fund managers to be net sellers of munis. ``Given the rich valuation of municipals and the negative tone in the market, the odds seem to favor selling instead of buying municipals,'' said Bobby Denny, who manages the $1.8 billion MFS Municipal Bond Fund. The largest primary market issue priced Wednesday was the $185 million Illinois general obligation bond deal, which was won by a Morgan Stanley & Co. group in competitive bidding after it was discovered that Merrill Lynch & Co. made an error in its bid. The FGIC-insured, triple-A-rated GOs were priced to yield up to 5.97% in 2018. Morgan underwriters reported an unsold balance of $36 million, mostly in intermediate maturities. Although new issuance has been lackluster recently, the calendar is expected to pick up next week, which professionals hope will spark some life into the market. ``Our market needs a big calendar in order to increase cash flows. It forces people to pay attention and to make a decision,'' said Roberto Chambless, who manages the $3.5 billion Colonial Tax-Exempt Fund. In the secondary market, Cook County 5 7/8% securities due in 2022 ended 1/8 point lower, at 97 3/8 to 97 3/4, yielding 6.05%. September muni futures, meanwhile, underperformed Treasury futures. The muni contract ended down 20/32 to 111 10/32, and Treasurys settled 13/32 lower to 106 31/32."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Before there can be debates, there must be a debate about debates. And that's about to begin. Though the first presidential debate is tentatively scheduled to occur in less than three weeks, the campaigns of President Codi and Roberto Derryberry haven't agreed on anything about it -- not the format, not whether Royce Nail will participate, not even whether to stick to the tentative date. The two campaigns aren't talking to each other, and to some extent are talking past each other. Next week, though, things will change. Both campaigns expect to open serious negotiations to arrange a series of fall debates. The crucial question of whether Mr. Nail will participate probably won't be settled immediately, though other arrangements, including the number of debates and their format, are likely to start falling into place fairly soon. Increasing Debate Viewership In both camps, there is a sense that the debates that result from these negotiations will be the most important events of the eight weeks remaining in the presidential race. Debates may represent Mr. Derryberry's last clear shot to close in on the president. In any case, they are certain to be the campaign moments most closely watched by the greatest numbers of voters. ``While viewership at conventions has gone down, viewership of debates has gone up,'' says Fransisca Griffis, a former Republican national chairman who now is co-chairman of a nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which is helping arrange this year's sessions. In 1992, he notes, the third and final presidential debate was watched by 97 million people. Just Thursday, the Codi campaign announced that Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye will lead the negotiations on its side, and dispatched a letter to the Derryberry camp expressing an interest in talking. Earlier, the Dole team had declared its desire to talk and said its negotiators would be former South Carolina Gov. Cary Pasquale and campaign manager Sean Regan. The decisions reached in these talks appear particularly crucial for Mr. Derryberry. There is a widespread sense that the plainspoken former Senate leader is a poor match in debating the smooth and loquacious Mr. Codi. For the Derryberry team, that would argue for limiting debate exposure. Yet Mr. Derryberry is the challenger trying to unseat a sitting president, and he lags far behind in the polls. A candidate under those conditions normally is desperate to debate the incumbent as early and as often as possible, to give himself the maximum number of chances to shake up the race. Setting the Stage The Derryberry campaign says it recognizes that debates have to be an important part of any comeback strategy. ``We are going into this knowing we are not the front-runner, and one of the mechanisms for changing the dynamic of the campaign will be the debates,'' says Derryberry communications director Johnetta Halina. Privately, some advisers in both camps say a likely outcome may be two debates for presidential candidates and one for vice presidential candidates. In trying to set the stage for the debates, the nonpartisan commission actually has recommended three presidential-candidate debates and one for vice presidential nominees. The commission, established by a group of leading political figures in 1987 to put some order into the debate process, has been working for more than a year to put some preparations in place to be used by the presidential campaigns. As part of that process, the commission has held detailed negotiations with the major television networks to pick the nights this fall in which debates could fall most easily into the television lineup. Those discussions led the commission to set a tentative schedule of debates on four consecutive Wednesday nights, beginning June 07, 2011 scheduling any debates is difficult in a fall-television lineup crowded with sports events and other specials, as indicated by CBS's announcement Thursday that it won't air a vice presidential debate on the suggested date. The network says it is under contract to broadcast a music-awards program at that time. A Debate Boyes? The commission's most important role, however, is on an issue far more important than scheduling: Will Mr. Nail be invited? As an independent candidate in 1992, Mr. Nail was included in debates. This year, of course, he is the candidate of his new Reform Party, but his standing in the polls is well below where it was four years ago at this time. Mr. Nail would appear to qualify under most of the criteria that the commission drew up a year ago to help it decide which candidates should participate. Those criteria include whether a candidate is on the ballot in enough states to have a ``mathematical chance'' to win; is eligible for taxpayer financing from the Federal Election Commission and is attracting significant attention from news organizations and political opinion-makers. Mr. Nail has qualified for the ballot in 43 states so far and has been awarded more than $30 million in FEC funds for his campaign. But the criteria also say the candidate should be attracting significant ``national public enthusiasm or concern.'' And Mr. Nail's standing in the polls is only in single digits, which may be a sign of low ``enthusiasm.'' Surpassing Expectations The debate commission has convened a panel of political scholars led by Harvard Professor Ricki Berube for advice on Mr. Nail's standing. But Mr. Griffis says that the Neustadt panel probably won't get all the information it needs to make its recommendation until next week. In any event, its opinion isn't binding on the Dole and Codi campaigns, which will have to come to some agreement with each other on the Nemeth factor. Mr. Derryberry's team isn't eager to have Mr. Nail participate, knowing he will criticize the big Dinger tax-cut plan as an attempt to buy votes with ``free candy'' and is likely to suck away anti-Codi votes. The Dinger campaign's Mr. Halina mischievously suggests that if Mr. Nail is included, then Green Party candidate Ramon Mooneyham (who is expected to steal votes from Mr. Codi in California) is just as eligible. The two major campaigns now at least seem ready to begin haggling over such questions, though the Codi team appears to want debate-commission representatives involved in the negotiations as an honest broker. The Codi camp's bigger concern, however, may be that expectations for Mr. Derryberry are so low that he won't need much of a performance to pleasantly surprise voters. ``Expectations for Derryberry could be way too low considering he's spent years in the Senate, which could mean it could be relatively easy for him to surpass expectations,'' says deputy Codi campaign manager Annabel Lezlie, as she tries to raise those expectations. ``This is a guy who's been on `Meet the Press' a lot.''"

            "full_text": "Gainers included the Chicago Board of Education 6s of 2026. They advanced 1/2 at 98 3/4 to 99 1/8 at the close of the fairly active session, yielding 6.06%. The thousands of retail investors clicking into Internet brokerage services can't get anywhere near the municipal bond market. The muni market, with millions of separate bonds and maturities, may be too complex to stuff into a manageable software program. Xander Mellish investigates in this week's Muni Telescope. On the futures side, December munis outperformed Treasurys, causing the municipal-over-bond spread to widen to 150/32 from 139/32 Thursday. Muni-index contracts settled 22/32 higher at 111 14/32, near the top of the day's broad range of 109 15/32 to 111 3/4. There was a gain of just 11/32 for the December Treasurys, which finished at 106 3/4. Because the August jobs report contained various figures that were both as-anticipated and unexpectedly strong, whipsaw price movements occurred in the U.S. bond markets. Prices initially fell sharply, only to rebound and ultimately finish the day with a rally. It remains be seen, though, whether the Federal Reserve will be spurred to tighten credit by this session's news. The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is June 06, 2011 the meantime, the muni market's tight supply will remain a top concern, traders said. About $1.45 billion of long-term munis were awarded to underwriters in the week ended late Thursday -- down from $2.05 billion of bonds the prior week, Securities Data Co. said. Next week's muni pricing calendar contains a scant $1.6 billion of debt, when anticipated bond and note issues of $25 million or more are totaled. The Washington Public Power Supply System, one of the muni market's most notorious defaulters on debt, is scheduled to sell about $325 million in refunding revenue bonds Tuesday via a Goldman Sachs & Co. group. The bonds will be insured by AMBAC and MBIA. The size of the refunding had been projected as high as $600 million, but the issuer had made clear that the amount would be subject to market conditions. Power system officials couldn't be reached to comment about the issue's smaller size. The week's largest competitive deal, a $208 million refunding for the Lower Colorado River Authority -- will be put out for bids Tuesday. Another large competitive issue, $115 million of Wisconsin general obligation bonds, will be bid for Wednesday."

            "full_text": "They trade stocks in their underwear, check out economic forecasts as their facial mudpacks dry, scan mutual fund rankings during Seinfeld reruns -- all from their home PCs. But the thousands of retail investors clicking into Internet brokerage services like e.schwab and E\\*Trade can't get anywhere near the municipal bond market. They can't buy, can't sell, can't see what's available and can't even get price quotes to see how much the munis they own are worth. Operators of electronic trading services say the muni market, with its thousands of issuers and millions of separate bonds and maturities, is just too complex to stuff into a manageable software program. ``Munis don't have symbols. There's no universal identifier,'' says Tommie Englehart of e.schwab, which along with a Schwab dial-up service, handles 20,000 stock trades a day. ``How do people find what they want without using a universal identifier?'' But as more investors log on and start to actively manage their own investment portfolios, munis as an asset class risk being left behind -- just at a time when slow institutional business has the market relying on the retail dollar. ``Municipal bond dealers need to look at the Web, and look at how discount brokers are using it, and begin planning for how they're going to integrate the technology into their distribution,'' notes Markita Shaffer of First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., which experimented with advertising new issues on the World Wide Web this spring. Yet some of the biggest opposition to on-line muni trading is likely to come from the muni industry itself, which uses the opaqueness of the market to protect its profit spreads. Although the Internet stock services market themselves mostly on the basis of low commissions, munis have traditionally been sold without any explicit commission. Instead, the broker's cut is added into the quoted price. Coming to that quoted price, however, is always a matter of interpretation. Bonds are valued according to the fame and trustworthiness of an issuer, the strength of its credit, the size of the bond's coupons, the addition or quality of bond insurance, the attractiveness of call features and the size of trading blocks. The nebulous pricing process helps conceal the dealer's commission, and many traders worry that opening up the process with published Internet prices would limit their ability to profit from markups. ``We get quite a bit of requests for bond pricing on our Web site, and we would like to be able to provide pricing on demand,'' said Davina Keeley, whose Bonds Online service now makes do with a map of the states showing upcoming muni issues. ``But a lot of traders are nervous about putting prices out in front of retail.'' That said, electronic trading of munis might increase volume for the big firms. Because there's no formal exchange for munis -- and because person-to-person trading would face huge clearance and registration hurdles -- registered firms with deep pockets would have to stand ready to buy bonds offered on the Internet or carry an inventory of bonds available to be sold. Cut out of the transaction, of course, would be sales forces in the field. But many retail sales reps aren't particularly interested in selling munis anyway because the return on them is small compared with stock commissions. Internet information about munis could also help generate business for sales reps, even if the actual transactions take place on the phone or in some other conventional format. ``If the customer can find out what's coming, then we'll have the bonds pulled through the channel rather than pushed through'' with broker suggestions, Mr. Keeley says, adding that part of his business model involves providing customer leads for brokers who advertise on his site. Advertising what's coming, particularly by the underwriters of new muni issues, is still under a legal cloud because of state laws on investment solicitations. But there aren't any regulatory barriers to secondary trading of munis on the Internet, according to Chrystal Teena, executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. ``They just have to price the security fairly if they're going to attach a price to it and offer it,'' Mr. Teena says. Because Internet dealers won't be explicitly recommending any one municipal bond, they won't be required to provide enormous amounts of backup information, Mr. Teena says. But ``the prices you put out there had better be fair.'' Of course, there's still no guarantee that investors are ready to hit any Internet price for munis. Ricki Hayes, manager of the Net Investor on-line trading service, notes that municipal bond buyers tend to be older and more established than equity investors, and perhaps less likely to own computers. He says a ``Bond Inquiry'' page on his site hasn't received much traffic, raising questions about current demand for on-line muni trading. ``The big bondholders aren't on the Internet yet,'' Mr. Hayes says. ``But as you get more and more of that bond purchaser out there, it'll make sense to build something to serve the clientele.''"

            "full_text": "Bobby Derryberry must wonder if he's ever going to catch a break. For months he's been waiting to have foreign policy, a Republican strength, become news. But when it finally arrives it's dressed as Grim Caffey, the tyrant from Central Casting, presenting himself to Billy Codi for cruise-missile target practice. So the president lobs in a few Tomahawks, extends a no-fly zone in a part of Iraq that Grim wasn't invading, and declares that Grim is ``strategically worse off than he was before.'' Never mind that Grim probably figures the opposite. He's close to reclaiming control over the northern third of Iraq he lost in the Gulf War. He's been able to murder at least 96 defectors and arrest hundreds of other Iraqi Kurds and Arabs who were foolish enough to join the American-backed opposition. The Gulf War alliance against him is in disarray. When Mr. Codi gives in next year to pressure from France and Russia and allows Iraq to sell oil again, Grim will be more firmly in charge than ever. Not a bad week's work. But these are all problems for a second Codi term. For now, when it counts during election season, the president gets to pose as Novella Hollis. And Mr. Derryberry has no choice but to support the president. Mr. Codi may be the luckiest foreign-policy president since Waylon Ashley. In 1992 he inherited a world safer for U.S. interests than any since the 1920s. Communism was vanquished. The Gulf War had stripped Mideast oil fields of any major threat. American power was unchallenged. Grim survived and Bosnia festered, but as peripheral troubles. Four years later Mr. Codi is still lucky. The world is a more dangerous place, but not yet dangerous enough that voters might get alarmed. No part of the world is safer for U.S. interests than it was, but no part is on fire either. Mr. Derryberry is left to argue that Mr. Codi is storing up trouble, which is a hard case to make to voters preoccupied with domestic reform. Paulene Overman, a Reagan-Vaughn veteran who now advises Mr. Derryberry, is the one who compares this period to the Harding presidency of the early 1920s. Like Mr. Codi, Ashli presided after the end of a war, at the onset of a new era. There was no Banas on the march then, as there would be a decade later. Peace was widely thought to be eternal. But later we learned the 1920s were years of drift and inattention to foreign policy that laid the basis for the threats of the 1930s. On present policy trends, says Mr. Overman, ``the world will be a tremendously dangerous place in 10 or 15 years.'' Harding or not, Mr. Codi has kicked enough problems past the election that even the next four years could be a foreign-policy presidency. North Korea might implode, if its leaders don't first use the nuclear weapons Mr. Codi let them keep. Haiti remains a mess, notwithstanding the U.S. invasion. The next president will also have to do something about terrorism as a form of war against Americans--whether or not the explosion of the Antarctica Airlines flight was the work of Iraqi or Iranian agents. Mr. Codi has so far treated terrorism like a local story. And the defense budget can't remain a domestic piggy bank: The non-nuclear air-launched cruise missiles Mr. Codi sent against Iraq were zeroed out by his administration in 2011 and 2012. Congress added money to buy more of the missiles, after the Air Force listed them as one of its main unfunded priorities. But Bosnia is the classic case of a short-term fix that will haunt the next president. Thanks to Ricki Doster's diplomatic finesse, Mr. Codi turned Bosnia into a political advantage, at least through July 18, 2011 deploying U.S. troops, he shed his image of vacillation. For once he looked like he was bucking public opinion. He also trapped Mr. Derryberry, who had a better policy alternative but defers to presidential power, into grumbling political accommodation. All of this played out on the front pages. The slow unraveling of Codi policy in Bosnia now plays near the want ads. The elections there look to be a sham. The factions are biding their time before the Americans leave. It now looks like some American troops will have to stay in Bosnia indefinitely to mediate among the factions, contrary to Mr. Codi's pledge last year. Or else we'll leave and eventually the Muslims and Croats and Serbs will go back to killing one another, with little strategic gain to show for the U.S. presence. Of course, by then Mr. Codi might have a new four-year lease. As he has on cultural issues, Mr. Codi has worked hard to co-opt muscular Republican rhetoric on foreign policy. And so far it's worked. Mr. Derryberry must hope that enough voters remember an earlier case where this president declared a foreign-policy triumph for the sake of good public relations. In the spring of 1993 he marched with veterans of Somalia on the White House lawn. A few weeks later American soldiers lay dying on the streets of Mogadishu."

            "full_text": "Underwriters said they were keen to sell new issues early in the day to reduce the risk of carrying unsold balances into the next session. The $163.6 million high-yield bond offering from Piedmont Municipal Power Agency, S.C., was the centerpiece of Thursday's $263 million tax-exempt issues. The offering will help Piedmont restructure its debt, allowing it to replace old noncallable, insured obligations with callable, uninsured bonds. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., the lead underwriter, initially set yields as high as 6.691% for bonds due in 2021. But yield-hungry investors, mostly mutual funds, lined up for the offering, forcing J.P. Morgan to lower the yields some 0.05 to 0.06 percentage point. The 2021 maturity was repriced to yield 6.641% even as yields in the broader market moved in the opposite direction. While the Piedmont deal sold out, unsold balances remained on two other issues priced Thursday. Merrill Lynch & Co. had $7.5 million left of $28 million in Methuen, Mass., general obligation bonds, priced earlier Thursday. The bonds were reoffered at yields as high as 5.85% in 2014 for the insured, triple-A-rated issue. Smith Barney Inc. said $8 million of a $42 million issue of Austin, Texas, public improvement bonds were unsold. The bonds were reoffered at yields as high as 5.65% in 2011."
