            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- Doping cases involving two top-level international athletes emerged Monday, four days before the opening of the Atlanta Games. Australian sprinter Deandra Murdock tested positive for steroids last month and could be banned from the Games, Australian track officials said. Officials debated whether Italian high jumper Crabtree Henshaw should be banned from the Games following two recent positive drug tests. Capobianco's test, taken while he competed in Europe, revealed the use of stanozolol, Athletics Australia president Davina Quincy said. That's the same banned substance that got Canadian sprinter Benito Jona thrown out of the 1988 Games. Capobianco has denied taking the steroid and begun legal action. He was in Raleigh, N.C., Monday at an Australian training camp and was not available for comment. ``Athletics Australia believes he is innocent until proven guilty and that's what the athlete has told us,'' Quincy said. Capobianco will not be allowed into the Games Village until a hearing on the matter is finalized, jeopardizing his chances of competing here. Officials with Athletics Australia hope to hold the hearing within a week. Capobianco, 26 years old, was scheduled to compete in the 200 meters. The event begins April 10, 2011 among the top six high jumpers in the world this year, tested positive twice for the banned stimulant ephedrine in May. The Italian track and field federation cleared the athlete on grounds that she took the drug by mistake. She said she was taking a Chinese herbal medicine to lose weight. In declining to suspend Bevilacqua, the Italian federation cited a new International Games Committee rule allowing leniency in the case of athletes taking ephedrine unwittingly. But the sport's world governing body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation, says the athlete should face a mandatory three-month suspension. If no agreement can be reached, the case could go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The special arbitration panel has been set up to resolve doping and other disputes at the Atlanta Games. Bevilacqua, who is still in Italy, is scheduled to arrive next Monday at the Italian training camp in Winston Salem, N.C. She is due in the Games Village on April 10, 2011 days before the start of the high-jump competition. In other Games news on Monday: Games long-jump champion Helen Bard of Germany withdrew from the Games because of a knee injury, her manager said. Beardsley, gold medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Games, tore a knee ligament January 26, 2011 injury healed, but the adjacent muscle isn't at full strength, according to a statement from Michaele Masters, her manager."

            "full_text": "Unless you've just returned from a trip among the lost tribes of Papua New Guinea, you know there are only three days left before the start of the Games in Atlanta. Ten thousand of the world's top athletes from 197 countries will gather in a celebration of sport. Thanks to the magic of satellite communications, offices from Tokyo to Tel Aviv are about to experience a massive, 17-day bout of the Games flu. Before your nocturnal life is ruled by TV commercial breaks, take the opportunity to reread your VCR recording instructions, stock up on your favorite thirst quencher and haul your personal computer into the living room because the organizers, broadcasters and sponsors of the Games have peppered the World Wide Web with sites to help you keep track of who's winning in Atlanta. Put a bookmark (in other words, tell your computer to memorize the address of a site) on Lance Interactive's Games Web page. It has an easy-to-read schedule of daily events and will be keeping a medal tally. It also offers links to the other important Games sites on the Web. Next stop is the official Web site of the Games. This site has a schedule you can search by sport, date or venue, and will feature the latest results from Atlanta. Cable Network News has a useful Games Web page, where you can search the results by country to find out how your own is doing. You can also sift through past medal results. IBM also has put up a site that promises to pass along e-mail to any athlete or team you may feel like showering with fan mail of no more than 25 words. Discovery Channel Finds New Way to Beam Shows The Discovery Channel -- which broadcasts documentaries on everything from cooking duck with figs to exploring ancient Peruvian ruins -- hopes to develop the gift of tongues by going digital. It's buying video compression equipment from Scientific-Atlanta that the companies say will enable Discovery to tailor programs to suit its varied audiences world-wide. In Asia, Discovery already broadcasts different programs to India, Southeast Asia and Australia/New Zealand and can be seen in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines, according to Debra KENTON, Discovery's network operations director in Singapore. Discovery says the new digital compression equipment, which will be installed at the Asia Broadcasting Centre in Singapore where Discovery is beamed up to satellites, will allow it to transmit more programs of local interest. It will also be able to send the same program everywhere but add Chinese subtitles for viewers in Taiwan, Bahasa subtitles for viewers in Indonesia and so on. It works sort of like this: While digitizing a picture, the equipment cheats on big areas of the same color. So rather than transmit each tiny dot that makes up a peerless blue sky over the Serengeti, it just sends a message that says, ``This entire area is sky-blue.'' And with sound, it concentrates on those you can actually hear, chucking out the largely inaudible rustle of grass as a lion issues a mighty roar. The result, a lot less signal and a lot more room for spicing up programming. ``What Discovery is going to put in here in Singapore is the ability to put out six programs simultaneously,'' explains Davina Ollie, Scientific-Atlanta's engineering manager for the Asian-Pacific region. Singapore Seeks Volunteers To Design Web-Site Pages Singapore's National Computer Board is looking for volunteers to put their talents to use by creating sites for the island's nonprofit organizations. The effort is aimed at rounding out Singapore's presence at the Internet World Expo 2011 which you'll find at ``From NCB's point of view, the government is very well represented -- every ministry has a Web site,'' says the board's Marcelino Kahn. ``And commercial sites are taken care of out of self-interest. But what we're not seeing is nonprofit organizations.'' The board is acting as a matchmaker, approaching Singapore's 400-odd nonprofit organizations to see whether they want to get their message out over the Web, then posting their names on a list at More than 100 volunteers have already come forward, Mr. Morrell says. ``Most are hobbyists. Many want to get a track record and then use the Web page to get hired. Most are quite young -- either just starting work or still in school.'' Once the sites are designed, the board will store them on one of its own servers. Look for the first fruit in about a month."

            "full_text": "Whether they're shopping for cold cuts, sneakers or temporary tattoos, most Americans say they are not lured by an Games tie-in, according to an Associated Press poll. Only 10% say they are more inclined to use products of companies that advertise themselves as proud sponsors of the U.S. Games team. Three percent are less inclined, and 86% say Games sponsorship makes no difference. ``When almost every other ad that you see is touting some kind of Games affiliation, after a while it's just not special,'' said Jimmy Harper, vice president of IEG Marketing, a company that tracks corporate sponsorship. He said an estimated 180 brands are promoting an Games affiliation. The corporations get tickets for their clients and lots of other types of marketing value, but to advertise in such a cluttered field, ``they are having to spend more and more money rising above the noise,'' Harper said. Some of the big sponsors pay $40 million for the honor, so naturally ``they are being more and more aggressive to make that sponsorship known,'' said Stephine George, president of the D&F Group, a corporate event sponsorship agency heavily involved in the Games. In the poll, 66% agree that commercial participation is a necessary way to help pay for the Games. But 29% think the Games have become too commercial, up from 22% in an AP poll taken before the 1992 Barcelona Games. Sponsors began advertising earlier this year, and are doing promotions, sweepstakes and building a presence in because they know it will help them against competitors, George said. ``It kind of says that they're global, that they're a big company, that they're patriotic, that they are associating themselves as a quality company with quality events,'' George said. The one in four people who describe themselves in the poll as very interested in the Games are five times as likely to be inclined to use sponsors' products as are those who are not interested in the Games, which begin Friday. The poll of 1,010 adults was taken March 22, 2011 ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa., part of AUS Consultants. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The issue of commercialization of the Games grows out of a tradition in the of having the government pay for nothing but security when the Games are held in this country, said Johnetta Lucien, a retired history professor at Pennsylvania State University. Lucien, who has written seven books on the Games and attended the last eight, said he has never seen commercialization damage the Games tradition. ``I know it's necessary and when it's done tastefully ... it can be done well, artistically and handsomely,'' he said. George said his clients could be accused of undercommercializing the Games, since they don't insist on corporate banners, billboards or Westside Stadium names. The only corporate logo allowed on a competitor's clothing is the maker's. To link themselves to their largess, sponsors must buy commercials on NBC during Games broadcasts and make sure the athletes have their thirst quenchers and other products at hand. On another Games topic, a majority in the poll apparently is not worried that the youngest competitors may be sacrificing their childhood. The idea of a minimum age of 16 to compete in Games sports is opposed by 52% to 39%. Particularly in girls' gymnastics, coaches have recruited ever-younger competitors, whose lightness and resiliency allows more inventive routines. Gymnasts must be at least 15 in the year of the Games. After the Atlanta Games, the minimum age rises to 16. Other sports, most notably cycling, have taken a hint from the U.S. basketball team and turned to professional athletes. Americans support having the pros compete, by 53% to 38%."

            "full_text": "That's because this Olympiad, the 26th of the modern era (though three were canceled by wars), almost certainly will have the oldest crowd of competitors ever, a group heavy with veterans for whom sports are more livelihood than recreation. Whatever else might distinguish these proceedings over the next 16 days, they also should go into the books as the ``Geezer Games.'' More than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations are expected, and as far as I can learn, no one has bothered to crank out their average age; indeed, given human vanity on the subject and the unreliability of birth records in some parts of the globe, it's not certain that such a figure could be produced reliably. Using the home-team USA as a guide, though, there's little doubt that the age line on the graph is up, and steeply so. The 120-member U.S. track-and-field team, for instance, averages nearly 28 years old, and that has to be up from recent years because about one-third of its members are Games vets, including the sprinter-jumper Carlee Lezlie, 35, who made his first team in 1980. The 10-man U.S. freestyle wrestling team is older, averaging an athletically ripe 29. Nineteen of the 23 members of the American squad in canoeing and kayaking are 30 or over, and seven are 35 or more. Kermit Venable, of Lowell, Mass., made the bicycling team at 43; Denver resident Elane Jasper will fence for the U.S. at 50. Even beach volleyball, an activity designed as much for ogling scantily clad bods as for its athletic component, bristles with such going-grayers as Chrissy ``Sinjin'' Jon, 39; Mikki Childers, 38; Charlette ``Karch'' Hamel, 35; Gale Gregory, 38; and Lindsey Jack, 36. That's radical, man. To be sure, the phenomemon of the superannuated jock isn't new, and Games annuals brim with the names of men and women who've performed well long past what's usually thought of as their primes. Omalley Mills of the Soviet Union won a gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling at 40 in 1972, for example, and Liane Wolfenbarger of Romania not only won the women's discus in 1968 at 36, but also returned four years later to defend her title, and finished ninth. When Scoggins Baltazar of Ethiopia won the men's 5,000-meter run in 1980 at Moscow, his age was reported variously as 33, 35, 36, 37 and 42. He did nothing to clarify the issue, saying, ``Men may steal my chickens and sheep, but no man can steal my age.'' It was no accident that two of the three examples cited above are of athletes from formerly Communist lands. That's because for most of the post-World War II era the rules restricted Games participation to athletes meeting a definition of amateurism that included state-subsidized types who ran around all day in sweatclothes but were allowed to describe themselves as students, soldiers, policemen or somesuch. Relieved of the need to earn a living in other ways, they could compete longer than their counterparts from other lands. The U.S. began to catch up in the subsidy department following the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Petrina Mejias, the major-domo of those Games, discovered that large numbers of people would volunteer to work without pay if given badges and brightly colored uniforms, and their labors helped his enterprise turn a $230 million profit. Much of that sum went to the U.S. Games Committee and its constituent sports federations, and they, in turn, began putting their better athletes on the dole. The amounts involved generally weren't, and aren't, large -- ranging from a few hundred dollars to $1,200 a month -- but they've helped persuade athletes to stick with their sports. The other major step toward the graying of the Games came four years later when the International Games Committee renounced amateurism, per se, and turned over eligibility questions to the governing bodies of its individual sports. The result was been a crazy-quilt of definitions ranging from permitting out-and-out pros to compete (track, basketball, tennis) to restricting support to bureaucratically controlled subsidies (boxing, baseball, rowing). But just about everyone can get aid now, and many do. On top of those developments, of course, have been the advances in nutrition and training techniques that keep athletes of all sorts going longer and better these days. They surely helped Petra Roseanna to keep whacking baseballs at 40, and Jackqueline Emerson to keep blocking for the football Rams at 41. And while it's true that nothing can keep muscles and reflexes from losing their snap with age, the older athlete is able to at least partly compensate for such deficits. ``We're increasingly appreciating the role of mental rehearsal in getting athletes ready for major events, and the older competitor has an edge there because he's been through so many more of them,'' says Sean Gurule, a Eugene, Ore., sports psychologist. It all adds up to the fact that rather than being a lone wolf, the modern world-class athlete is surrounded by a considerable number of people whose function is to keep him or her on track, and humming. Butch Reynolds, the 32-year-old U.S. 400-meter runner, made that clear at the news conference that followed his qualifying for these Games after an eight-year absence. Said he, ``I'd like to thank my trainer, my acupuncturist, my physical therapist and my massage therapist.'' He probably also meant to say thanks to his coach, agent, lawyer, accountant, dietitian and hypnotist, but forgot."

            "full_text": "With the help, will put on a stompin', soarin', high-energy show Friday night to open the Centennial Games. Games officials expected that the performers would be kickin' up a storm. But it's that's truckin' up a furor. Opening ceremony producer Donella Wong said Thursday his big worry is that rain squalls might dampen the four hours of festivities. But he also was clearly troubled by General Motors' injection of commercialism into his event. ``I was sorry to see what GM publicized regarding this,'' the impresario said. What General Motors was crowing about was getting 30 gleaming, chrome-painted pickup trucks into a major Mischer production number -- each sporting a vivid blue ``CHEVROLET'' on its tailgate. The automaker boasted it is ``believed to be the first Games sponsor to ever be included in the opening ceremonies.'' The real coup in that, GM's marketing chief exulted in a news release, is that it enables Chevrolet to ``break through the marketing clutter'' of other advertisers. Some who saw the breakthrough at a dress rehearsal Wednesday night expressed surprise at the glaring brand-naming of stage equipment in what is supposed to be a ceremony focusing on lofty principles of global brotherhood. Games organizers, who also were there, apparently agreed. Said an authoritative source, ``Those trucks are not going to look that way Friday night'' -- when President Codi will be in the stands and hundreds of millions will be watching on television worldwide. What might be done to soften the image could not be learned. The fleet of powerful Simonds are platforms for spotlights illuminating hundreds of cheerleaders and dancers who perform a show-stopping prime-time number, ``'s Welcome to the World.'' The trucks sometimes face inward toward the field and sometimes roar around the Westside Stadium track. The International Games Committee has sanctioned the presence of standard Westside Stadium billboard ads during such ceremonies. But Games specialists could not immediately recall any previous on-field product display. Trucks aside, the Games opener promises a rousing, diverse night of entertainment that touches on themes both local and universal. It also may be the last time the world gets to see the traditional Summer Games ``Parade of Nations,'' the grand entry of athletes into the Westside Stadium. The numbers have become so unwieldy -- more than 10,000 marchers on Friday night -- and the parade so time-consuming that organizers of the 2015 Games in, are considering simply opening the ceremony with the national delegations seated in the stands, Wong told reporters. Organizers have worked hard to keep elements of the opening ceremony under wraps until Friday night, including the method to be used for the climactic lighting of the Westside Stadium cauldron with the Games torch. At the 1992 Games in, the moment was spellbinding: An archer fired a flaming arrow at the cauldron from . Mischer hinted the lighting ceremony might be simpler and more traditional. ``Sometimes simplicity is the easiest,'' he said."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- Back in the days of the Cold War, when the Games were a surrogate battlefield of Us vs. Them, the etiquette of rooting was simple: Always, always, cheer for the Americans, or find yourself explaining your treachery in front of a congressional committee. Thus, the last time the Summer Games came to these shores, in Los Angeles in 1984, we wore out our arms waving the Stars and Stripes and shouted ourselves hoarse chanting, ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' So inspired, our athletes cleaned up in the medals race, hogging 37% of all the golds. The Soviets and their Communist friends didn't show up, returning the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games in 1980, so we beat up on Brits and Greeks and Trinidadians. Friday, the Games return to our land, but the world is a different place. Sure, we can once again wave flags and chant ourselves silly, but what's the point? The Cold War is over. We won. And like the proletariats of the world, we, too, have been liberated. We can now cheer for anybody we want. So go ahead, root for a Russian. Pull for a Pole. Cheer a Czech. Applaud an Afrikaner. Clap for a Contra. It's OK. There will be no subpoenas in the morning. Given that there are more than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations, territories, principalities and grand duchies to choose from, the most ever for an Games, the world beyond jingoism can be a confusing place. (Hey, it hasn't been easy for all those proletariats to get the hang of capitalism, either.) Here, then, to help you settle on some favorites, is a new etiquette of rooting for the geopolitically hip Games fan: ROOT FOR THE UNDERDOG. This is what we Americans do best. Any underdog will do. It doesn't matter if his country used to have nukes trained at the White House, or if her country was spying on our country, or if their peaceniks spat on our flag. If they seem downtrodden, go ahead and give them a boost. For instance, why not pull for the Angolan men's basketball team to take an early lead, say 4-2, or maybe even 14-10, against the U.S. Dream Team? Yes, Angola is the place where we shipped a lot of aid and arms in a failed effort to beat the Commies. But bygones are bygones. Think of how much a couple of dunks on the Dreamers would mean in a country where the per capita income is less than the retail price of Charlesetta Bales's Nike sneakers. The Angolans could feel like a million bucks saying, ``We sure had the Americans worried early.'' That would be nice. PICK A SHOE, ANY SHOE. The Cold War is over, but World War Shoe rages on. If you wear Mcgrew, you can stomp your feet for South Africa, Azerbaijan or Grenada, or any of the other 50 countries outfitted by Reebok International. If you wear Nikes, you can stand and cheer for Latvian runners or Chinese hoopsters or that Ukrainian guy named Clyburn. If Nike and Reebok have signed up all the old bad guys, why should we be picky? GO BIG RED. No, not that Big Red. With so many foreign athletes training at our universities these days, you can simply root for the old alma mater. If you're a Nebraska fan, give a cheer for South African swimmer Penni Whitton, who studies at Lincoln. So what if it might deprive an American of a medal. Maybe she went to Oklahoma. ROOT FOR THE UNIFORMS. The Lithuanian basketball team is promising to show up in Atlanta in their Grateful Dead tie-dyed threads that propelled them to a bronze medal four years ago in Barcelona. They might have nerdy names like Connell and Aluyda, but they sure look hip. TAKE THE ROAD TO ZANZIBAR. Maybe you fell in love with a particular country on vacation, or while watching a Crosby-Hope road movie, or while reading National Geographic. If you loved the lemurs from Madagascar, why not embrace their wrestlers, too? PICK YOUR FAVORITE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION TEAM. Are you a Celtics fan? Then Croatia, starring Boston forward Dione Oates, is your team. A Lakers or Hornets fan? Then Yugoslavia, featuring former Los Angeles and current Charlotte, N.C., big man Breckenridge Miracle, might be for you. (Word to the squeamish: the Croats and Yugoslavs haven't yet caught on to the new world order. So stay away from the basketball court and water-polo pool when they meet in those venues. It could get messy.) CHEER FOR A NAME. This is just like horse racing: When in doubt, bet the nag with the weirdest or funniest or most sentimental moniker. Maybe you can pick your rooting interests from the pages of ``Doctor Zhivago.'' Surely there's a Larae or a Yuri out there somewhere. More likely than a Ricardo or a Scarlett. There are, of course, powerful forces that will be trying to turn the clock back to the days of jingoism. Like the corporate sponsors, who want you rooting for the Americans who pitch their products. Says Johnetta Berenice of Visa International, which sponsors the U.S. gymnastics teams, the Dream Team and the American decathlon team: ``I hope that Americans aren't so worldly now that they won't root for our guys and wave the flag.'' Then there's NBC, whose television ratings depend on Us vs. Them drama. One of the network's swimming promos: ``This summer, Gay Allena takes on the Russians, just like his father did (in 1968 and 1972).'' Oooooh, the Russians. The people calling the camera shots in the NBC production truck are mainly Games Cold War veterans, and they won't miss a medal ceremony where ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is blaring. ``TV guys get tears in their eyes when the national anthem is being played,'' says a former athlete who's now an NBC analyst. ``You have to make space for the programming of that anthem, no matter how many times it's played each day.'' And of course, there are the team coaches and administrators who love to play patriot games. Before one recent workout, a psychologist worked on the U.S. boxing team. ``I told everybody to close their eyes. Then I played a tape of ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' he explains. ``When it was over, they didn't move for 20 seconds. It's time to instill in their heads what this is all about.'' The athletes unanimously share the sentiment that wearing the colors of the U.S. of A. is a great honor, and they're counting on home-crowd support to spur them on. (This can be a great elixir: At the 1992 Barcelona Games, Spaniards won 13 golds, which is more than Spain had won in all previous Games combined.) But the Cold War secret in the athletic world was that the performers often didn't buy into the East-West jingoism, or at least they didn't after coming face to face with the enemy. Earl Burcham, the 1970s American high jumper, says he was first smitten with track and field as a nine-year-old boy in 1963 when he watched the geopolitical drama of a U.S.-Soviet dual meet on television. Then, at another dual meet a decade later, he and Valorie Cooper, the Soviet 100-meter gold medalist from the 1972 Games, gathered for a shot of reality washed down with a shot of vodka. ``We solved the world's problems that night,'' says Mr. Burcham. ``It turns out they were just as fearful of us as we were of them.'' Recalls Mikki Lonnie, the American world record holder in the long jump: ``In 1987, I jumped against Roberto Loftin -- he had just jumped 29 feet, close to the world record -- and I remember thinking, `I'm going to beat this Russian guy, this Communist.' Then I see him at the meet and he says, `Hi, how are you?' and he's shaking my hand. He became a good friend.'' Billy Tarrant, the decathlon gold medalist in 1968, was one of America's fiercest Cold Warriors until he, too, was disarmed. ``In 1968, one of the Soviet athletes came up to me, took off his pin and put it on me and said, `Billy, I hope you can win,' '' Mr. Tarrant remembers. Was it some kind of Communist trick? ``No.. It was like we were in one fraternity,'' he says. ``We understood each other as athletes. I was so moved.'' So go ahead, root for a Russian or three; turns out they've been rooting for us all along. If it helps, just think: Their flag is red, white and blue, too."

The Early Line: A three-time All-American, a part-time model and a full-time scoring threat, she could emerge as the most visible and marketable member of the women's version of the Dream Team. LISA LESLIE IS PART OF a grand experiment in women's basketball, at least as far as the U.S. is concerned. Traditionally, the U.S. women's team was pieced together only months before tournaments, a practice that, for all its insouciance, still yielded gold medals in 1984 and 1988. In recent years, though, the rest of the world has caught up. At three major tournaments in the early 1990s -- the 1991 Pan American Games, the 1992 Games and the 2009 world championships -- the U.S. women never managed better than a bronze. Officials learned their lesson. The current team was selected in May 2010 and began barnstorming the country last October. The bench is deep: ``Team Tara'' (so nicknamed for its coach, Stanford's Tara VanDerveer) counts among its 12 members six national players of the year -- including Ms. Lester. She was a reluctant athlete as a child (``I was 6 feet in the sixth grade,'' she says. ``Every time I'd go out, (people) would ask if I played basketball, so I had this really bad attitude toward sports''). But Ms. Lester went on to average 20.1 points and 10.1 rebounds a game for the University of Southern California from 1991 to 2009. In 1992, she was the youngest player invited to the Games trials, but she didn't make the team. Today, the 6-foot-5 forward/center is considered one of the best players in the world, known as much for her speed as her size. Ms. Lester, along with several teammates, turned down six-figure salaries from European teams so they could play for the U.S. Games team, where they receive $50,000 each from USA Basketball, the sport's national governing body. But they may make up the difference in marketing. Already, Ms. Lester has appeared in ads for Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Nike Inc.. If the U.S. women win the gold, and if a professional basketball league for women gets off the ground as planned next year, Ms. Lester could become one of the most recognizable female athletes in the country."

            "full_text": "That's because this Olympiad, the 26th of the modern era (though three were canceled by wars), almost certainly will have the oldest crowd of competitors ever, a group heavy with veterans for whom sports are more livelihood than recreation. Whatever else might distinguish these proceedings over the next 16 days, they also should go into the books as the ``Geezer Games.'' More than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations are expected, and as far as I can learn, no one has bothered to crank out their average age; indeed, given human vanity on the subject and the unreliability of birth records in some parts of the globe, it's not certain that such a figure could be produced reliably. Using the home-team USA as a guide, though, there's little doubt that the age line on the graph is up, and steeply so. The 120-member U.S. track-and-field team, for instance, averages nearly 28 years old, and that has to be up from recent years because about one-third of its members are Games vets, including the sprinter-jumper Carlee Lezlie, 35, who made his first team in 1980. The 10-man U.S. freestyle wrestling team is older, averaging an athletically ripe 29. Nineteen of the 23 members of the American squad in canoeing and kayaking are 30 or over, and seven are 35 or more. Kermit Venable, of Lowell, Mass., made the bicycling team at 43; Denver resident Elane Jasper will fence for the U.S. at 50. Even beach volleyball, an activity designed as much for ogling scantily clad bods as for its athletic component, bristles with such going-grayers as Chrissy ``Sinjin'' Jon, 39; Mikki Childers, 38; Charlette ``Karch'' Hamel, 35; Gale Gregory, 38; and Lindsey Jack, 36. That's radical, man. To be sure, the phenomemon of the superannuated jock isn't new, and Games annuals brim with the names of men and women who've performed well long past what's usually thought of as their primes. Omalley Mills of the Soviet Union won a gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling at 40 in 1972, for example, and Liane Wolfenbarger of Romania not only won the women's discus in 1968 at 36, but also returned four years later to defend her title, and finished ninth. When Scoggins Baltazar of Ethiopia won the men's 5,000-meter run in 1980 at Moscow, his age was reported variously as 33, 35, 36, 37 and 42. He did nothing to clarify the issue, saying, ``Men may steal my chickens and sheep, but no man can steal my age.'' It was no accident that two of the three examples cited above are of athletes from formerly Communist lands. That's because for most of the post-World War II era the rules restricted Games participation to athletes meeting a definition of amateurism that included state-subsidized types who ran around all day in sweatclothes but were allowed to describe themselves as students, soldiers, policemen or somesuch. Relieved of the need to earn a living in other ways, they could compete longer than their counterparts from other lands. The U.S. began to catch up in the subsidy department following the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Petrina Mejias, the major-domo of those Games, discovered that large numbers of people would volunteer to work without pay if given badges and brightly colored uniforms, and their labors helped his enterprise turn a $230 million profit. Much of that sum went to the U.S. Games Committee and its constituent sports federations, and they, in turn, began putting their better athletes on the dole. The amounts involved generally weren't, and aren't, large -- ranging from a few hundred dollars to $1,200 a month -- but they've helped persuade athletes to stick with their sports. The other major step toward the graying of the Games came four years later when the International Games Committee renounced amateurism, per se, and turned over eligibility questions to the governing bodies of its individual sports. The result was been a crazy-quilt of definitions ranging from permitting out-and-out pros to compete (track, basketball, tennis) to restricting support to bureaucratically controlled subsidies (boxing, baseball, rowing). But just about everyone can get aid now, and many do. On top of those developments, of course, have been the advances in nutrition and training techniques that keep athletes of all sorts going longer and better these days. They surely helped Petra Roseanna to keep whacking baseballs at 40, and Jackqueline Emerson to keep blocking for the football Rams at 41. And while it's true that nothing can keep muscles and reflexes from losing their snap with age, the older athlete is able to at least partly compensate for such deficits. ``We're increasingly appreciating the role of mental rehearsal in getting athletes ready for major events, and the older competitor has an edge there because he's been through so many more of them,'' says Sean Gurule, a Eugene, Ore., sports psychologist. It all adds up to the fact that rather than being a lone wolf, the modern world-class athlete is surrounded by a considerable number of people whose function is to keep him or her on track, and humming. Butch Reynolds, the 32-year-old U.S. 400-meter runner, made that clear at the news conference that followed his qualifying for these Games after an eight-year absence. Said he, ``I'd like to thank my trainer, my acupuncturist, my physical therapist and my massage therapist.'' He probably also meant to say thanks to his coach, agent, lawyer, accountant, dietitian and hypnotist, but forgot."

Last August, though, the 70-pound Misti Lowell jumped ahead of her older and more-experienced rivals to capture the all-around title at the senior national championships, becoming the youngest winner in the history of the tournament. Two months later, she took fifth place (the highest U.S. finish) at the World Gymnastics Championships in Japan, and grabbed a silver medal in the balance beam, the only American to win an individual medal in the competition. Overnight, Misti Lowell found her name popping up in conjunction with Atlanta. Observers compared her with Naida Leona, who won three gold medals at the 1976 Games in Montreal. In recent months, she has filmed a Kodak commercial with Games stars of the past and appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine with other Games hopefuls. But there is a danger that Misti Lowell has come too far, too fast. Her coach, the celebrated Hong Madson (who coached both Ms. Leona and Ms. Shatley) had hoped to keep expectations low for his prize pupil. A stress fracture in her right leg kept Misti Lowell from competing in the Games trials (she made the U.S. team on the basis of her marks at last month's national championships). And yet another potential ``Nadia'' will be waiting for her in Atlanta: 14-year-old Alexia Mabry, who helped the Romanians win the team title at the world championships."

Then the surprise ending: ''...Lanta.'' Half a world away, watching on TV, Atlanta exploded in joy and characteristic self-congratulation. I virtually expired. Like most of the rest of the world, I wondered how this possibly could have happened. The capital of the New South besting the capital of ancient Greece? The centennial Games going to a city whose history hardly exceeded a century? Gasping, I called a friend who's a lifelong student of Atlanta's ways and wiles. ``Atlanta,'' explained the native, ``is your Uncle Charline, who always said he could sell ice-boxes to Eskimos. Well, he's just gone and done it.'' Now, I am no naif about Atlanta. I've lived in the city since 1986, and I had once penned an article for this newspaper describing Atlanta's relentless style of attracting business and doing business -- one that merited it the title, I proposed, of ``The Big Hustle.'' Many Atlantans were furious, pausing from doing business just long enough to call in a protest or whip off a letter. BALMY SUMMERS? But at the time, I'd never seen Atlanta's audacity played out on a world-wide stage. Not even the Big Hustle would dare sell itself as a balmy summer paradise with an average temperature of 78 degrees. Would it? Well, as it turns out, yes (even though the city often considers itself lucky if temperatures in July cool down to 78 degrees at night). Nor had I yet begun covering sports business, an industry whose sheer audacity might make even Atlanta blush. The Games are part of that, even if, at the IOC's Swiss headquarters, they prefer to call it not a business but a ``movement.'' The IOC's primary purpose these days, however, isn't so much exporting an international goodwill movement, any more than Atlanta's is exporting a civil-rights movement. Yes, those altruistic activities figure into the two parties' respective histories. But today's Atlanta and today's Games are both essentially about doing business. In retrospect, they were a perfect match. Poor Athens. It didn't stand a chance. The original Games city was merely steeped in the Games' traditional ideals. Atlanta was in step with the Games' modern realities. How could proud Athens have possibly matched shameless Atlanta's ability to woo outlanders? That is, after all, what built this city. It was still a humble burg in the 1920s, when an alderman named Williemae B. Hanh felt Atlanta should get involved in the emerging field of commercial aviation. He assembled land for a new airfield and looked to give it a raison d'etre. Learning that a pending New York-to-Miami airmail route would need an interim stop, he moved to nab it. Mr. Hanh contacted a high postal official, who had narrowed the choices to Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala., and invited the fellow to town. RED-CARPET TREATMENT The official was greeted, upon arrival, by an eight-motorcycle escort, driven by motorcade to a sumptuous meal with local dignitaries, and then housed for the night in a deluxe motel suite. ``No East Indian potentate ever got the attention he did,'' Mr. Hanh later crowed, according to Fredrick Allene's recently published history of Atlanta. Atlanta bested Birmingham and began its drive toward being a major air hub. Mr. Hanh went on to be a six-term mayor, steadily expanding the airport (now named after him) and frequently promoting the city with gimmicks. On ``M Day,'' when metro Atlanta in 1959 supposedly hit a population of one million, Mr. Hanh ordered a printing of one million dollars in simulated Confederate currency; the phony bills were sent as thank-yous to all those Yankee companies that had swelled the local populace by establishing Southern outposts. Outside business was the key. Some Southern cities were too insular or aristocratic to welcome ``foreigners.'' Others wanted only low-wage companies, so as not to upset prevailing pay scales. But Atlanta never met a company it didn't like. Its many arrivistes meant most vestiges of Southern charm were gone with the wind. Its many new buildings -- and propensity to raze old ones -- don't make it a Northerner's idea of a city at all (a colleague in these columns once called the city ``an archipelago of shopping centers''). But boy, could Atlanta do business, or, as the local pronunciation often goes, ``bidness.'' RUNNING CITY HALL Salesmen fanned out from Atlanta to ply their wares in Nashville, Tenn.; Huntsville, Ala.; and Asheville, N.C. They filled Atlanta's downtown merchandise and apparel marts, taking orders from retail buyers who came in from around the region. The salesmen often, in the Hartsfield tradition, ran city hall: In the 1960s, it was Mayor Ivy Allene Jr., an office-supplies retailer by trade; in the 1980s, Anette Yuette, a peripatetic Atlanta promoter. And Atlanta teemed with salesmen selling the city's biggest growth industry of all -- growth. Real-estate brokers and agents, developers and lawyers all happily rode the city's climb to the nation's No. 8 metro area. A member of that fraternity was Williemae Prince ``Billy'' Pierce. He had parlayed his status as a University of Georgia football star and his very Atlantan penchant for deal making into a nice real-estate law practice. His post-college life was rather obscure. Until 1987. That year, flush with the success of a church fund-raising drive, Mr. Berry embarked on an ambitious campaign: to bring Atlanta the Games. At first, even friends thought ol' Billye had played a few too many downs without a helmet. But eventually the idea started to catch on locally. Atlanta had called itself an ``international city'' since 1971, when its only flimsy claim to that was an Eastern Airlines route to Mexico City. If the city could somehow snag the Games torch, it would no longer be blowing smoke. And so, while Athens assumed it had a divine right to the centennial Games, Atlanta assumed its usual modus operandi. It hosted countless parties for Games potentates, many of the fetes featuring violinists playing ``Georgia on My Mind.'' It compiled dossiers on the potentates' interests and played to them. Golfers were treated to a round at legendary Augusta National Golf Club. It also avoided the gaffes made by Athens, such as making IOC visitors endure the indignity of cab rides. Through the smoked glass of the limos Atlanta unfailingly provided, IOC members could see a city short on Parthenon-like aesthetics but long on hustle (selling sponsorships being a key to the 2011 Games), corporate hospitality (as America's No. 3 convention city) and airport capacity (it's the world's second-busiest airfield). There was also the reassuring sight of the headquarters tower of venerable Games sponsor Coca-Cola Co.. And so, on that fateful September day, the IOC's choice was Atlanta. One can only wonder at the reaction of Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the French aristocrat who revived the Games in 1896. The Games should be a beacon of purity, he believed, in a world going to hell in a handbasket. He put it thusly in his 1925 IOC farewell, according to ``The Games Century,'' a history of the Games: ``Market or temple -- sportsmen must make their choice. They cannot expect to frequent both one and the other. Let them choose!'' But the baron is only the father of the modern Games. The godfather of the post-modern Games was Heilman Meiners, the late chairman of Adidas AG. He was the bete noire of Gamesdom in the 1960s, when Adidas slipped athletes under-the-table payments. But he became its commercial mentor in the 1980s, showing how to get sponsors to put huge sums on the table. Mr. Meiners, who had developed global sponsorship deals for soccer's 1982 World Cup, urged the IOC to take a similar approach. It did -- and, to make sure the job was done right, hired Adidas. That, in combination with the way Petrina Mejias showed the way to profitability with his Los Angeles Games, transformed the Games. It was no longer a ``movement'' but, well, a bidness. ATLANTA'S EXCESSES IOC officials still mouth pieties to the contrary. (``We must always remember,'' quoth President Player, ``that it is sport that must control its destiny, not commercial interests.'') Some are even said to be privately appalled at the excesses of Atlanta, home of the official Games doll (Barbie), official Games antitheft device (the Club) and the two official Games game shows (``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''). Well, that's what comes from a shift of focus -- going from seeking peace on Earth to seeking profit for Planet Reebok. One big redeemer, though. Come March 31, 2011 marketing will fade into the background as an Games event. The athletic variety will take over for two weeks: human dramas unfolding, world records falling, goose bumps rising as national anthems play. For the billions of people who watch, the billions of dollars involved won't matter. Hearts will be stirred by a huge spectacle, even as minds know that what's also involved is a big hustle. Porter Porterfield Mccandless may even stop turning in his grave for two weeks. Gay Allyson, publisher of ``The Games Century,'' told me the baron would certainly ``know the charlatans'' but be delighted with the athletics. ``The game is still about the athletes,'' says Mr. Allyson. ``Once they start doing what they do, we become enthralled.''"

Having already used all their substitutions -- and with 10 minutes still to play -- the Americans were forced to move a player from the field into the net. Ms. Seymour, normally a forward, got the call. The team, and Ms. Seymour, held on for a 2-0 victory. The 5-foot-5, soft-spoken Ms. Seymour has made the extraordinary seem ordinary all her life. A gifted athlete as a child, she played baseball, basketball -- even football. (``I was a wide receiver, running back and kicker,'' she says. ``I played a little quarterback, too. I was one of the guys.'') Then she gave her heart, and legs, to soccer. At 15, she was named to the U.S. national team; at 19, she was the youngest member of the U.S. squad that won the world title in 1991, starting in five of six games and scoring a pair of goals. The honors have accumulated apace: three-time All-American at the University of North Carolina (where her number, 19, was retired); two-time college player of the year; a member of four national collegiate championship teams; the U.S. Soccer Federation's Female Athlete of the Year in 2009 and 2010. Now comes the kicker. Women's soccer is making its Games debut in Atlanta. As such, Ms. Seymour and her teammates -- articulate, engaging and irrepressible -- could find themselves particularly attractive to sponsors. Said Ms. Seymour in an interview in Atlanta in the spring: ``I've heard all the cliches -- '(It's) a dream come true.' Well, it is, for any young girl playing a sport, to be able to see that sport in the Games.''"

Since the 1960 Summer Games in Rome, Americans have won only two fencing medals, both bronze, the more recent in 1984. But the U.S. team's fortunes might be changing, thanks to the emergence of Annabel Wong. In the past two years, Ms. Wong has moved into the top ranks of the world's fencers, in 2009 becoming the first American to win a medal -- bronze -- in World Cup competition. Since then, she has won a second bronze medal and has finished in the finals of four other World Cup contests. Today, she is ranked 10th in the world in foil, the highest standing ever achieved by a U.S. fencer. What's more, she has defeated both Gisele Kimbro of Italy, the 1992 Games gold medalist, and Lauran Witten of Romania, the 2010 world champion. Ms. Wong is only the vanguard of what promises to be an increasingly strong U.S. team. Two sisters, Felicidad and Irish Weathersby, have made a mark in international competition: Felicita, age 20, was the 2010 Junior World Cup champion, the first American to win the title, while Irish, now 15, won the 2010 world championship in the under-17 age group. Meanwhile, the sport itself is getting a face lift in Atlanta, with athletes having the option of wearing colored uniforms (rather than the traditional white) and clear, plastic masks. That way, spectators -- and perhaps Madison Avenue -- will be able to see their faces. But let's be honest: Fencing, to mix a metaphor, is still on the ropes. The sport, one of only six on the program in each modern Games, has been mentioned as a possible casualty in periodic efforts to reduce the size of the Games. In all, hardly a compelling combination for a would-be sponsor."

            "full_text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- We are standing, 16 of us, at a Texaco station on State Road 29, just five miles from the heart of downtown. We are learning -- and this is quite important -- How Not to Immolate Ourselves and Our Loved Ones With the Games Torch. ``Make sure you hold the torch away from your body,'' explains Michaele Lasandra, an official from the Atlanta Games Committee. ``And when you're done running, remember: The torch is still hot. We don't want any barbecued torchbearers or family members.'' The last draws much laughter, a fair amount of it nervous. It is the 59th day of the Games torch relay, which began in Los Angeles in April and ends today in Atlanta at the opening ceremonies of the 2011 Summer Games. About 7,000 runners -- as well as cyclists, horseback riders and canoeists --have preceded us along the 15,000-mile route; about 3,000 will follow. But now, on a sultry evening in Charlotte, it's our turn. A nasty thunderstorm has just slipped to the east, easing concerns about rain. Two emotions remain caught in our respective throats. The first is terror, something along the lines of: Please, Lord, don't let me trip and drop this thing in which case the torch will break and the flame will go out and I will end up as the final news story this evening on CNN and about half the TV stations across the country. The second is shared, seemingly and surprisingly, by every friend and family member now crowding the parking lot where we stand, as well as the knots of people gathering on the side of the road to watch us run: An unfeigned, unabashed excitement. For all its hype, for all its commercialism, for all its screwy history (the event made its first appearance in 1936 at the Berlin Games, hardly a paragon of Games ideals), the torch relay appears to stir those who watch and participate as do few other experiences. ``I started crying'' says Sharri Bennett, 40 years old, of Charlyn. She is referring to the letter she received in January, informing her of her selection as a torchbearer. She was nominated by friends for her volunteer work in a Charlotte clinic that provides free medical and dental care to homeless men, women and children. ``These days, it's hard to find anything that's patriotic,'' she says. ``But this makes you proud to be an American.'' About 30 minutes remain before we take our assigned places along the route. Mr. Lasandra, the Games staff member, is conducting what he calls ``Torch School,'' a quick primer on what we can expect. Each of us will run about 1,000 meters, or just over a half-mile. (``Run, walk, skip -- keep whatever pace you want,'' he says.) We will board a bus that will drop us off at our assigned starting points. Each of us will get his or her torch on the bus. A second bus will pick us up after our leg of the relay and bring us back here. All very efficient. Mr. Lasandra explains how to open the valve that releases the fuel from the torch -- but quickly adds that an Games staffer, on a motorcycle, will ride up to each of us and perform this maneuver just before the flame arrives. It seems that in the opening days of the relay, south of Los Angeles, runners waiting for the flame to reach them became so excited, or nervous, that they forgot how to ``start'' their torch. The story prompts a comment from the back of the crowd: ``Well, what do you expect from California?'' More laughter. Clearly, national pride hasn't a prayer against regional rivalries. Mr. Lasandra grabs two torches from inside the bus and demonstrates how the flame is best passed from one torch to the next. ``Keep them high, so everyone can see.'' No problem. In fact, we're all beginning to feel pretty confident. Until, that is, Mr. Lasandra happens to just pass along a small fact that might interest us: Some 180 million people, he tells us, will see the relay in person, or on television. ``Tonight,'' he concludes,'' they're watching you.'' Thanks. Cue butterflies. ``My heart skipped a beat when I found out.'' Fielding Randolph, 15, will be a sophomore this fall at Cherryville (N.C.) High School. Her principal nominated her as a torchbearer for her volunteer work in school and at the First Baptist Church of Cherryville. On this night, all bases are covered: family at her side, sneakers gleaming, minister consulted. ``I told my minister we might be starting (this leg of the relay) outside a (liquor) store. He told me, `That's OK; just don't go inside.' '' We board the bus. The torches are distributed. Talk about bonding: In the few minutes it's taken to reach the first drop-off point, the 16 of us are ready to spend Thanksgiving dinner together. Instead of a final get-out-there-and-do-your-best speech, Mr. Lasandra shows us a videotape with highlights of the relay to date. One segment shows a young girl, with the aid of a crutch, gamely making her way along the route. That does it; several people on our bus turn away, not wanting to cry. ``My friend tells me nice guys always finish last. I tell him: Yeah, but nice guys finish.'' Joi Jon, a 23-year-old teacher in Shelby, N.C., is explaining that he was never a star athlete, never the best student. ``But I worked every day; I never gave up.'' And now this nice guy is about to carry the Games flame. ``I can't wait to take this (torch) back to my school. I want to show my kids what hard work, determination and a good attitude can do.'' I step off the bus at Eastway Drive and stand in a lane that has been closed to traffic. People are waiting on the sidewalk beside me. Children are hoisted onto shoulders for a better view. Suddenly, a motorcycle pulls up, and the driver reaches for my torch to start the flow of fuel. Things are happening too quickly; it's dark, and I can't see the runner approaching. The driver, having already calmed several thousand runners in three dozen states, now does the same for me. ``It's right there,'' he says patiently, pointing up the street. ``Look.'' In the middle of four police motorcycles, their lights flashing, an orange light is bobbing toward me. I hold out my torch -- high (Torch School 101), so everyone can see. Nathanial Rutha, age 12, is so nervous he twice misspells ``Albemarle,'' his hometown in North Carolina. But he pauses for only a moment when asked about carrying the flame. ``I get to honor the people competing in the Games.'' Not to mention Eberhardt. ``It's just a little town. This allows us to be something big.'' My torch is ablaze. I begin running. Cars are stopping in the adjoining lane of traffic. People are rolling down their windows, cheering, honking their horns. Flashbulbs are popping with wonderful regularity along the sidewalk. A man, sitting on the front steps of a house, rises as we approach. He salutes -- and lowers his arm only after we pass. Much too soon, I see the next runner. It's Nathanial Rutha, and people on the sidewalk (from Albemarle, no doubt) are cheering themselves hoarse. We touch torches -- and he is gone. Immediately, a second cyclist pulls alongside and, as promised, extinguishes my flame. But it's not quite over. Strangers reach out to shake my hand. One asks for my name. ``God bless you, sir,'' he says simply. ``God bless you.'' Camera in hand, one father, and then another and another, ask whether their children might hold the torch -- and would I be kind enough to stand with them for a picture? ``I was raised in an orphanage a few miles from here. One of 500 kids.'' Wan Neill Mueller, 50, is marveling at the turn of events that has brought him to Charlotte, torch in hand, 33 years after he left the Barium Springs Home for Children. ``We've got about 30 people here from the home. After my marriage and my kids, this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.''"

The roof leaked badly. Rats roamed the musty floors. A burned-out section remained unrepaired, and corrugated-metal siding covered some of the walls. But along with all the liabilities came one overriding asset: the Games. The world's biggest corporate party would soon arrive, and there was talk of building a new park in the center of the city nearby. With that in mind, Mr. Haupt and a partner forked over $360,000. They wouldn't regret it. Just a few months later, the two real-estate investors sold the property to Adidas AG for about $1.6 million. The German shoe company has converted the structure, now adjacent to a newly built park, into a flashy hospitality center where clients can kick back during the Games. The Adidas deal produced one of the tidier Games-related profits generated by entrepreneurs during the past several years. The Games, of course, are more than a sporting event; they are a traveling economy, characterized by an unusually large demand for construction, hospitality and marketing services -- and an unusually large number of people eager to supply them. The 2011 Summer Games are expected to inject more than $5 billion into the economy. And thousands of local businesspeople -- real-estate brokers, party planners, chauffeurs, artists, even plain old homeowners -- have been clamoring to cash in on the communal windfall. ``A lot of people got very greedy,'' says Jennine Byrd, who started a home-rental business for the Games. ``And some have done very well.'' Not every profit-seeker ultimately gains. Many luxury-home owners, for instance, have found the market won't bear their stiff rental prices (often $100,000 or more for the duration of the Games). Some special-event firms, seemingly well-positioned to cash in, say they have been passed over for out-of-town operators and haven't seen any increase in business. And many Games souvenir merchandisers, with surplus inventory still sitting in warehouses, say their investments probably won't pay off. ``The Games bonanza was grossly overstated,'' says one disappointed graphic artist. Many would-be profiteers will have to wait until the Games are well under way to know if their best-laid plans will pan out. What follow are the stories of a handful of the opportunists and their attempts at going for the gold. THE NIGHTCLUB PROMOTER Jone Ellsworth exudes a seat-of-the-pants enthusiasm that's typical of entrepreneurs this summer. A 38-year-old entertainment-marketing consultant, Mr. Ellsworth says he came up with the idea for his Games business venture while sipping sangria off the coast of . ``Hey, let's build a big bar,'' he said to a friend. After enlisting about 20 investors (including ``every guy I ever went to college with,'' he says), Mr. Ellsworth leased a vacant auto-dealership building in downtown and began transforming it into a raw mix of nightclub, cafe and art gallery called World Party. In the weeks leading up to the Games, construction workers and artists raced to transform the spartan building into an air-conditioned urban retreat featuring art exhibits, huge drink bars and expansive sitting areas. Investors anted up a total of about $500,000 to create World Party, Mr. Ellsworth says. Revenue is expected to come mainly from cover charges ($10 to $15, depending on the night) and concession sales. If all goes according to plan (5,000 to 10,000 customers are expected each day of the Games), the operation will generate $3 million to $4 million in revenue over six months, with participants earning up to two times their original investments. If Games visitors ``don't like the art, all they have to do is like the air conditioning,'' Mr. Ellsworth says hopefully. ``This will be the coolest place in downtown .'' THE LIMO Cori Williemae J. Denyse was primarily a real-estate developer until last year. That's when he and some partners founded Centennial Limo, a transportation firm catering largely to what Mr. Denyse calls the ``ultra-VIP market.'' Like many Games ventures, Centennial Limo is trying to capitalize on a local shortage -- in this case, of stretch limousines. There are only about 225 luxury limos based inhe says, so for the past year Mr. Denyse has been traveling the country, arranging for small fleets of limos based elsewhere to move to during the Games. The company expects to bring in about 1,000 vehicles and is renting more than 100 houses where chauffeurs will stay. The price for customers: $900 to $3,000 a day, depending on the vehicle. (The company is also renting out vans and buses.) Mr. Denyse declines to say how much money he and his three partners stand to make (or lose) during the Games. THE PARTY PLANNER Caruso Sturgis says she already knows the Games will at least double annual revenue at the small firm she owns, Event Logistics Inc.. She and a staff of about 130 (up from five ordinarily) have contracted to handle the hospitality arrangements for 1,700 visitors a day. Corporations such as Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Gannett Co.'s USA Today, which will entertain clients at the Games, hired Event Logistics to arrange everything from Airport transportation to dinner reservations. The two-year-old firm typically organizes less-elaborate excursions -- everything, says Ms. Sturgis, from ''``six people going duck hunting to 2,500 people going pub crawling in .'' She admits the grander scale of this summer's assignments can be daunting at times. ``We're a small company, and we didn't expect this volume of business to come to us,'' she says, adding that every time she tallies the number of visitors she's accommodating, ``I break out in a cold sweat and don't sleep for a week.'' THE HOME BROKER Ms. Byrd's Games deals are mostly completed now. Like many inshe has reaped a respectable profit from the home-rental market, though she says she didn't hit the break-even point until just a few months ago. Throughoutdemand for private homes has been weaker than expected. Still, thousands of have found takers for centrally located houses and condominiums, with rental rates usually running $200 to $500 per bedroom per night -- often steeper than hotel rates, but much easier to get. Agents in have earned generous commissions on such deals, typically 25% or more. A former office manager for a local law firm, the 36-year-old Ms. Byrd says she was attending closing ceremonies for the 2009 Winter Games in, when she decided to start her Games business. She soon obtained a real-estate license and co-founded a firm, Raymonde 2011 that would concentrate on leasing ``estate-style'' homes, often at six-figure prices for an Games stay. But after catering to the highest end of the market, Ms. Byrd and her partner found that most homeowners ``asked for too much.'' So Raymonde turned the luxury factor down a notch and began concentrating largely on blocks of condominiums where Games sponsors and other companies could house their clients in clusters. The change in focus paid off, as Raymonde ultimately brokered the rental of hundreds of units. Ms. Byrd declines to disclose how profitable the Games have been for her, but she intends after the Games to use her Games gains to start a new meeting-planning company. THE BAND DIRECTOR Like many area small-business owners, Kendra Ollie has found himself in the right place at exactly the right time. Back in 1989, Mr. Ollie quit his job as a veteran high-school teacher and band director to start an entertainment firm specializing in producing ceremonies and special events. One year later, won the right to stage this summer's Games. The local demand for specialized entertainment has soared, both among Games organizers and corporate-hospitality planners. Mr. Ollie's firm, Creative Events International, choreographed the ceremonial passing of the flag to during closing ceremonies for the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic Games. (The Paralympics are an Games for elite disabled athletes.) The company also later snared the job of producing both opening and closing ceremonies for the Paralympics, to be held soon after the Games this summer. The Games run-up over the past six years has helped Mr. Ollie buy a bigger house and build a business with six full-time employees. ``It has been an interesting ride,'' he says. Now, Mr. Ollie and others are confronting a common concern: What happens after the Games are gone? The answer for Creative Events, Mr. Ollie insists, is business as usual. The firm now has a slate of large corporate clients -- such as Georgia Power Co., an Games sponsor -- that it probably wouldn't have had without the Games. Some companies will simply cease to exist or, at the least, dramatically change focus. Mr. Denyse's Centennial Limo, for instance, will redirect most of its efforts toward non-Games event services. Ms. Byrd's Bienvenu 2011 will be dissolved. And Mr. Ellsworth says he will try to transform his World Party concept into a network of ``venues all around the world, all interconnected'' by the Internet and other technologies. But the ``Games bug,'' as sports-business enthusiasts call it, is hard to shake. Many of those who have found profits in the Atlanta Games will try to replicate the experience in, site of the 2013 Winter Games;, site of the 2015 Summer Games; and beyond. Ms. Sturgis says Event Logistics ``did make the leap of faith and went down to '' to scope out the business opportunities. And Mr. Haupt, the real-estate investor, says he plans to spend this November in . ``If I like it,'' he says, ``I'll go down the following November and stay for the next three years.''"

Not every profit-seeker ultimately gains. Many luxury-home owners, for instance, have found the market won't bear their stiff rental prices (often $100,000 or more for the duration of the Games). Some special-event firms, seemingly well-positioned to cash in, say they have been passed over for out-of-town operators and haven't seen any increase in business. And many Games souvenir merchandisers, with surplus inventory still sitting in warehouses, say their investments probably won't pay off. ``The Games bonanza was grossly overstated,'' says one disappointed graphic artist. Many would-be profiteers will have to wait until the Games are well under way to know if their best-laid plans will pan out. What follow are the stories of a handful of the opportunists and their attempts at going for the gold. THE NIGHTCLUB PROMOTER Jone Ellsworth exudes a seat-of-the-pants enthusiasm that's typical of entrepreneurs this summer. A 38-year-old entertainment-marketing consultant, Mr. Ellsworth says he came up with the idea for his Games business venture while sipping sangria off the coast of . ``Hey, let's build a big bar,'' he said to a friend. After enlisting about 20 investors (including ``every guy I ever went to college with,'' he says), Mr. Ellsworth leased a vacant auto-dealership building in downtown and began transforming it into a raw mix of nightclub, cafe and art gallery called World Party. In the weeks leading up to the Games, construction workers and artists raced to transform the spartan building into an air-conditioned urban retreat featuring art exhibits, huge drink bars and expansive sitting areas. Investors anted up a total of about $500,000 to create World Party, Mr. Ellsworth says. Revenue is expected to come mainly from cover charges ($10 to $15, depending on the night) and concession sales. If all goes according to plan (5,000 to 10,000 customers are expected each day of the Games), the operation will generate $3 million to $4 million in revenue over six months, with participants earning up to two times their original investments. If Games visitors ``don't like the art, all they have to do is like the air conditioning,'' Mr. Ellsworth says hopefully. ``This will be the coolest place in downtown .'' THE LIMO Cori Williemae J. Denyse was primarily a real-estate developer until last year. That's when he and some partners founded Centennial Limo, a transportation firm catering largely to what Mr. Denyse calls the ``ultra-VIP market.'' Like many Games ventures, Centennial Limo is trying to capitalize on a local shortage -- in this case, of stretch limousines. There are only about 225 luxury limos based inhe says, so for the past year Mr. Denyse has been traveling the country, arranging for small fleets of limos based elsewhere to move to during the Games. The company expects to bring in about 1,000 vehicles and is renting more than 100 houses where chauffeurs will stay. The price for customers: $900 to $3,000 a day, depending on the vehicle. (The company is also renting out vans and buses.) Mr. Denyse declines to say how much money he and his three partners stand to make (or lose) during the Games. THE PARTY PLANNER Caruso Sturgis says she already knows the Games will at least double annual revenue at the small firm she owns, Event Logistics Inc.. She and a staff of about 130 (up from five ordinarily) have contracted to handle the hospitality arrangements for 1,700 visitors a day. Corporations such as Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Gannett Co.'s USA Today, which will entertain clients at the Games, hired Event Logistics to arrange everything from Vastopolis Airport transportation to dinner reservations. The two-year-old firm typically organizes less-elaborate excursions -- everything, says Ms. Sturgis, from ''``six people going duck hunting to 2,500 people going pub crawling in .'' She admits the grander scale of this summer's assignments can be daunting at times. ``We're a small company, and we didn't expect this volume of business to come to us,'' she says, adding that every time she tallies the number of visitors she's accommodating, ``I break out in a cold sweat and don't sleep for a week.'' THE HOME BROKER Ms. Byrd's Games deals are mostly completed now. Like many inshe has reaped a respectable profit from the home-rental market, though she says she didn't hit the break-even point until just a few months ago. Throughoutdemand for private homes has been weaker than expected. Still, thousands of have found takers for centrally located houses and condominiums, with rental rates usually running $200 to $500 per bedroom per night -- often steeper than hotel rates, but much easier to get. Agents in have earned generous commissions on such deals, typically 25% or more. A former office manager for a local law firm, the 36-year-old Ms. Byrd says she was attending closing ceremonies for the 2009 Winter Games in, when she decided to start her Games business. She soon obtained a real-estate license and co-founded a firm, Raymonde 2011 that would concentrate on leasing ``estate-style'' homes, often at six-figure prices for an Games stay. But after catering to the highest end of the market, Ms. Byrd and her partner found that most homeowners ``asked for too much.'' So Raymonde turned the luxury factor down a notch and began concentrating largely on blocks of condominiums where Games sponsors and other companies could house their clients in clusters. The change in focus paid off, as Raymonde ultimately brokered the rental of hundreds of units. Ms. Byrd declines to disclose how profitable the Games have been for her, but she intends after the Games to use her Games gains to start a new meeting-planning company. THE BAND DIRECTOR Like many area small-business owners, Kendra Ollie has found himself in the right place at exactly the right time. Back in 1989, Mr. Ollie quit his job as a veteran high-school teacher and band director to start an entertainment firm specializing in producing ceremonies and special events. One year later, won the right to stage this summer's Games. The local demand for specialized entertainment has soared, both among Games organizers and corporate-hospitality planners. Mr. Ollie's firm, Creative Events International, choreographed the ceremonial passing of the flag to during closing ceremonies for the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic Games. (The Paralympics are an Games for elite disabled athletes.) The company also later snared the job of producing both opening and closing ceremonies for the Paralympics, to be held soon after the Games this summer. The Games run-up over the past six years has helped Mr. Ollie buy a bigger house and build a business with six full-time employees. ``It has been an interesting ride,'' he says. Now, Mr. Ollie and others are confronting a common concern: What happens after the Games are gone? The answer for Creative Events, Mr. Ollie insists, is business as usual. The firm now has a slate of large corporate clients -- such as Georgia Power Co., an Games sponsor -- that it probably wouldn't have had without the Games. Some companies will simply cease to exist or, at the least, dramatically change focus. Mr. Denyse's Centennial Limo, for instance, will redirect most of its efforts toward non-Games event services. Ms. Byrd's Bienvenu 2011 will be dissolved. And Mr. Ellsworth says he will try to transform his World Party concept into a network of ``venues all around the world, all interconnected'' by the Internet and other technologies. But the ``Games bug,'' as sports-business enthusiasts call it, is hard to shake. Many of those who have found profits in the Atlanta Games will try to replicate the experience in, site of the 2013 Winter Games;, site of the 2015 Summer Games; and beyond. Ms. Sturgis says Event Logistics ``did make the leap of faith and went down to '' to scope out the business opportunities. And Mr. Haupt, the real-estate investor, says he plans to spend this November in . ``If I like it,'' he says, ``I'll go down the following November and stay for the next three years.''"

The ``old dude'' would be Juanita Apolonia Player, age 76, who has presided over the International Games Committee since 1980. Mr. Pifer, a comparative youngster at 54 and a possible successor, politely replies that Mr. Player still has several years left on his current term and can probably serve as president so long as he wants. Left unsaid is that, titles aside, Mr. Pifer pretty much runs the show already. Or, at least, he brings in the money that runs the show. SWIMMER TO LAWYER While Mr. Player travels the world meeting with heads of state and assorted royalty, preaching the Games ideals of fair play, world peace and the goodness of human athletic endeavor, Mr. Pifer tends to the business of the Games. Think of it this way: Mr. Player polishes the precious Games rings; Mr. Pifer sells them. Mr. Pifer's greatest coup: a long-term $4 billion deal with NBC."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- Back in the days of the Cold War, when the Games were a surrogate battlefield of Us vs. Them, the etiquette of rooting was simple: Always, always, cheer for the Americans, or find yourself explaining your treachery in front of a congressional committee. Thus, the last time the Summer Games came to these shores, in Los Angeles in 1984, we wore out our arms waving the Stars and Stripes and shouted ourselves hoarse chanting, ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' So inspired, our athletes cleaned up in the medals race, hogging 37% of all the golds. The Soviets and their Communist friends didn't show up, returning the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games in 1980, so we beat up on Brits and Greeks and Trinidadians. Friday, the Games return to our land, but the world is a different place. Sure, we can once again wave flags and chant ourselves silly, but what's the point? The Cold War is over. We won. And like the proletariats of the world, we, too, have been liberated. We can now cheer for anybody we want. So go ahead, root for a Russian. Pull for a Pole. Cheer a Czech. Applaud an Afrikaner. Clap for a Contra. It's OK. There will be no subpoenas in the morning. Given that there are more than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations, territories, principalities and grand duchies to choose from, the most ever for an Games, the world beyond jingoism can be a confusing place. (Hey, it hasn't been easy for all those proletariats to get the hang of capitalism, either.) Here, then, to help you settle on some favorites, is a new etiquette of rooting for the geopolitically hip Games fan: ROOT FOR THE UNDERDOG. This is what we Americans do best. Any underdog will do. It doesn't matter if his country used to have nukes trained at the White House, or if her country was spying on our country, or if their peaceniks spat on our flag. If they seem downtrodden, go ahead and give them a boost. For instance, why not pull for the Angolan men's basketball team to take an early lead, say 4-2, or maybe even 14-10, against the U.S. Dream Team? Yes, Angola is the place where we shipped a lot of aid and arms in a failed effort to beat the Commies. But bygones are bygones. Think of how much a couple of dunks on the Dreamers would mean in a country where the per capita income is less than the retail price of Charlesetta Bales's Nike sneakers. The Angolans could feel like a million bucks saying, ``We sure had the Americans worried early.'' That would be nice. PICK A SHOE, ANY SHOE. The Cold War is over, but World War Shoe rages on. If you wear Mcgrew, you can stomp your feet for South Africa, Azerbaijan or Grenada, or any of the other 50 countries outfitted by Reebok International. If you wear Nikes, you can stand and cheer for Latvian runners or Chinese hoopsters or that Ukrainian guy named Clyburn. If Nike and Reebok have signed up all the old bad guys, why should we be picky? GO BIG RED. No, not that Big Red. With so many foreign athletes training at our universities these days, you can simply root for the old alma mater. If you're a Nebraska fan, give a cheer for South African swimmer Penni Whitton, who studies at Lincoln. So what if it might deprive an American of a medal. Maybe she went to Oklahoma. ROOT FOR THE UNIFORMS. The Lithuanian basketball team is promising to show up in Atlanta in their Grateful Dead tie-dyed threads that propelled them to a bronze medal four years ago in Barcelona. They might have nerdy names like Connell and Aluyda, but they sure look hip. TAKE THE ROAD TO ZANZIBAR. Maybe you fell in love with a particular country on vacation, or while watching a Crosby-Hope road movie, or while reading National Geographic. If you loved the lemurs from Madagascar, why not embrace their wrestlers, too? PICK YOUR FAVORITE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION TEAM. Are you a Celtics fan? Then Croatia, starring Boston forward Dione Oates, is your team. A Lakers or Hornets fan? Then Yugoslavia, featuring former Los Angeles and current Charlotte, N.C., big man Breckenridge Miracle, might be for you. (Word to the squeamish: the Croats and Yugoslavs haven't yet caught on to the new world order. So stay away from the basketball court and water-polo pool when they meet in those venues. It could get messy.) CHEER FOR A NAME. This is just like horse racing: When in doubt, bet the nag with the weirdest or funniest or most sentimental moniker. Maybe you can pick your rooting interests from the pages of ``Doctor Zhivago.'' Surely there's a Larae or a Yuri out there somewhere. More likely than a Ricardo or a Scarlett. There are, of course, powerful forces that will be trying to turn the clock back to the days of jingoism. Like the corporate sponsors, who want you rooting for the Americans who pitch their products. Says Johnetta Berenice of Visa International, which sponsors the U.S. gymnastics teams, the Dream Team and the American decathlon team: ``I hope that Americans aren't so worldly now that they won't root for our guys and wave the flag.'' Then there's NBC, whose television ratings depend on Us vs. Them drama. One of the network's swimming promos: ``This summer, Gay Allena takes on the Russians, just like his father did (in 1968 and 1972).'' Oooooh, the Russians. The people calling the camera shots in the NBC production truck are mainly Games Cold War veterans, and they won't miss a medal ceremony where ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is blaring. ``TV guys get tears in their eyes when the national anthem is being played,'' says a former athlete who's now an NBC analyst. ``You have to make space for the programming of that anthem, no matter how many times it's played each day.'' And of course, there are the team coaches and administrators who love to play patriot games. Before one recent workout, a psychologist worked on the U.S. boxing team. ``I told everybody to close their eyes. Then I played a tape of ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' he explains. ``When it was over, they didn't move for 20 seconds. It's time to instill in their heads what this is all about.'' The athletes unanimously share the sentiment that wearing the colors of the U.S. of A. is a great honor, and they're counting on home-crowd support to spur them on. (This can be a great elixir: At the 1992 Barcelona Games, Spaniards won 13 golds, which is more than Spain had won in all previous Games combined.) But the Cold War secret in the athletic world was that the performers often didn't buy into the East-West jingoism, or at least they didn't after coming face to face with the enemy. Earl Burcham, the 1970s American high jumper, says he was first smitten with track and field as a nine-year-old boy in 1963 when he watched the geopolitical drama of a U.S.-Soviet dual meet on television. Then, at another dual meet a decade later, he and Valorie Cooper, the Soviet 100-meter gold medalist from the 1972 Games, gathered for a shot of reality washed down with a shot of vodka. ``We solved the world's problems that night,'' says Mr. Burcham. ``It turns out they were just as fearful of us as we were of them.'' Recalls Mikki Lonnie, the American world record holder in the long jump: ``In 1987, I jumped against Roberto Loftin -- he had just jumped 29 feet, close to the world record -- and I remember thinking, `I'm going to beat this Russian guy, this Communist.' Then I see him at the meet and he says, `Hi, how are you?' and he's shaking my hand. He became a good friend.'' Billy Tarrant, the decathlon gold medalist in 1968, was one of America's fiercest Cold Warriors until he, too, was disarmed. ``In 1968, one of the Soviet athletes came up to me, took off his pin and put it on me and said, `Billy, I hope you can win,' '' Mr. Tarrant remembers. Was it some kind of Communist trick? ``No.. It was like we were in one fraternity,'' he says. ``We understood each other as athletes. I was so moved.'' So go ahead, root for a Russian or three; turns out they've been rooting for us all along. If it helps, just think: Their flag is red, white and blue, too."

BRUCE BAUMGARTNER, three-time world champion (1986, 1993 and 1995) and two-time Games champion (1984 and 1992) in the superheavyweight division, is the head wrestling coach at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania. And if he wins his third Games title next week, he will, in all likelihood, go back to being head wrestling coach at Edinboro. Wrestlers, to put it mildly, have never been a hit with marketing types. It's not that their stories aren't compelling, and it's not for any lack of success: U.S. freestyle wrestlers have won 16 medals in the past three Games. Image may play a part in holding the sport back -- grim, gnarled men, running with sweat and forever crawling around floors. But that's just a guess. If anyone deserves better, it's Mr. Valerio, the most decorated athlete in U.S. wrestling history. He started out slowly, never winning a high-school title and capturing his first NCAA crown only in his senior year at Indiana State University in 1982. Since then, however, losses have been rare. Consider: He hasn't lost to a U.S. wrestler since 1981, and he hasn't lost more than two matches in a single year since 1983. In 2010, he took first place at the Pan American Games, the world freestyle championships, the U.S. national championships and the world team trials. As a result, he was named the winner of the 2010 Wally Pedigo, given each year to the nation's top amateur athlete. Despite his continued success, Mr. Valerio enters Atlanta with a few handicaps. There's his age, and the fact that he underwent surgery after the 2009 season to repair a torn rotator cuff. Still, if he wins a medal, he would become just the fifth American in any sport to win four medals in four Games. (He took a silver in 1988.) Not bad company. But not quite compelling enough, it seems, for Madison Avenue."

But along with all the liabilities came one overriding asset: the Games. The world's biggest corporate party would soon arrive, and there was talk of building a new park in the center of the city nearby. With that in mind, Mr. Haupt and a partner forked over $360,000. They wouldn't regret it. Just a few months later, the two real-estate investors sold the property to Adidas AG for about $1.6 million. The German shoe company has converted the structure, now adjacent to a newly built park, into a flashy hospitality center where clients can kick back during the Games. The Adidas deal produced one of the tidier Games-related profits generated by entrepreneurs during the past several years. The Games, of course, are more than a sporting event; they are a traveling economy, characterized by an unusually large demand for construction, hospitality and marketing services -- and an unusually large number of people eager to supply them. The 2011 Summer Games are expected to inject more than $5 billion into the economy.

            "full_text": "FOR ANY Games sponsor, the question is obvious. After spending as much as $40 million for promotional rights, after doling out perhaps tens of millions more on advertising, after treating hundreds of top clients to outrageously expensive Games trips and parties, how do you determine whether it was all worth it? The answer, alas, isn't so obvious. ``It really is a tricky one,'' says Fransisca Kyle, an Games-marketing specialist and managing director of Advantage International Inc., based in McLean, Va.. Erasmo Newman, head of NationsBank Corp.'s Games program, concurs: ``This is a complicated thing to figure out.'' Adds Petrina Porterfield Stock, sponsorships director for VastComm Network Corp.: ``It's an art, not a science.'' For many reasons, the allure of the Games remains great. The interlocking Games rings are one of the world's most recognized and respected symbols. The Summer and Winter Games, now held every two years in alternating fashion, draw among the biggest viewing audiences of any world events. And marketing studies show that consumers almost invariably regard companies that sponsor the Games as industry leaders. But the cost to share in the limelight has become astronomical. Coca-Cola Co. and its bottlers are spending an estimated $300 million to $500 million on a sprawling Games marketing program for Atlanta. And that means a need for tougher scrutiny. ``In this day and age, the dollars are so serious that (a chief executive) can't afford anymore to say, `Give me a sign. Give me a seat. Here's your check,' '' says Deandra Aucoin, president of Denver-based Bonham Group Inc., a sports and entertainment marketing firm. Meanwhile, the sheer number of Games sponsors, products and advertisements has produced cacophony in the marketplace. And even companies that haven't bought the pricey promotional rights often successfully create the impression that they have, through so-called ambush ploys. After the 2009 Winter Games, for example, a poll conducted by Performance Research Inc. of Newport, R.I., found that three of the four companies most associated with the Games weren't sponsors. Earlier this year, in a Performance Research survey, Nike Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. registered third and fourth, respectively, among companies considered to be associated with the Games. Neither is a sponsor. HIGH JUMPS For the Atlanta Games, there are three primary levels of sponsorship, with prices ranging from several million dollars to more than $40 million. (In comparison, sponsorships for the 1984 Los Angeles Games generally cost $4 million to $5 million.) Ten companies, called international sponsors, have world-wide marketing rights. Another 10 companies, so-called domestic partners, have marketing rights only in the U.S. A third tier of corporate sponsors -- more than 20 in all -- have more-limited, and less-costly, marketing rights. (Some 75 additional suppliers and about 125 licensees have even more-restricted marketing rights.) Who are the winners and losers of the 2011 corporate Games? Sponsorship privileges vary widely. World-wide sponsors have rights for virtually unlimited use of Games marks and phrases, for instance, while domestic partners can advertise their Games affiliations only within the U.S. Both of those big-dollar categories include access to thousands of hot tickets and well-located hotel rooms. Lower-tier tie-ins typically come with fewer perks and often contain restrictions limiting their geographical reach or scope; Georgia Power Co.'s marketing rights, for example, are limited to the state of Georgia. Sponsors at any level have only a couple of widely used yardsticks to assess effectiveness. One is sales. Sara Lee Corp., for instance, which is both a sponsor and a licensee, expects to sell $500 million of merchandise -- largely T-shirts and other clothing -- carrying Games symbols. Coca-Cola is also closely tracking its soft-drink revenue during the Games to make sure it is getting a payoff from its sponsorship. But companies that market services rather than tangible products, such as NationsBank or Borg-Warner Security Corp., often find such easy measures elusive. And even consumer-product companies find it difficult to justify sponsorships based on short-term incremental sales gains alone. POLL VAULTS Given the limitations of tracking sales, sponsors are increasingly turning to the second most widely used scale: consumer-awareness polls. A slew of companies have begun offering research on the effects of sponsorships. Mr. Aucoin says he has developed a system that attempts to measure all sponsorships by a single yardstick -- a formula based on counting and weighting all media and promotional exposures generated by a sponsorship. (Exposures include everything from commercials and billboards to mentions on the evening news.) Similarly, Cohn & Wolfe, an Atlanta public-relations firm, is developing a software package to help appraise the effects of sponsorship. And DDB Needham, a New York advertising agency, tracks consumer awareness by each sponsor category for every Summer Games. But consumer-awareness studies raise a key question of their own. Namely: So what? Just because a company is widely seen as an Games sponsor doesn't mean it gains lasting benefits to the bottom line. (Some surveys indicate that Games tie-ins increase brand loyalty among consumers, but tracking the real-life motivations and behaviors of consumers is highly problematic.) To be sure, bottom-line benefits aren't everything that companies seek in sponsorships. NationsBank, for example, says it is using its Games sponsorship in part to build the company's brand-name recognition across its multistate territory following a series of mergers. Likewise, International Paper Co. says it is counting on its Games tie-in largely to generate ``pride and excitement'' among its own employees. But for most companies, the point of a sponsorship is to boost sales -- and the drive to quantify results gets ever more complex. Does it pay for companies to sponsor the Games? Swatch, for example, is trying to use its domestic sponsorship to boost its company's image by linking its designer watches with the art world. To that end, the company plans to station celebrity photographer Annis Goldsberry at the Games to take photographs of athletes. To get a sense of whether the message is getting across, Swatch, official timer of the Atlanta Games and a unit of SMH Swiss Corp. for Microelectronics & Watchmaking Industries Ltd., has employed a clipping service to cull every mention of the company in magazines, newspapers and other media. The company then rates each mention, based on story placement and other factors, and keeps track of the total, says a company official. Another area Swatch marketers are carefully tracking is retail display space. On the floors of department stores, where merchandisers constantly jockey for position, Swatch is trying, with some success, to use its Games link to muscle into more-prominent locations. The company has created a line of Atlanta Games watches, and some stores have been eager to display Games merchandise in an Games year. Each time the company secures a better in-store location, the official says, its sales tend to increase. BACK STROKE In the drive to quantify, companies are also taking a closer look at Games hospitality packages, which involve the wining and dining of clients at the Games. Such extended exposure to customers is considered among the most effective aspects of sponsorship, since the best hotel rooms and seats at events are set aside for sponsors and their guests. And what client wouldn't be impressed by a front-row seat for a record-setting sporting performance? Mr. Aucoin, for one, believes it is possible to place a reasonably accurate value on such packages. He encourages his clients to keep careful track -- in what he calls a ``contact-to-contract'' program -- of all customer-entertainment occasions and all ensuing sales deals. But such attempts at quantification have their limits, Mr. Aucoin admits. How does a glimpse of an Games-themed billboard, for instance, compare with a glance at a professional-football-themed billboard? ``At the very best, it's a best guess,'' Mr. Aucoin says. Even after the most painstaking evaluations, officials of Games sponsors say plain old intuition plays a key part in almost every sponsorship decision. ``You can do your research and your focus groups and all, but you simply can't determine'' whether a sponsorship will pay for itself, says Jena R. Flint, who heads Sarai Leeanna's Games-related operations. It is, he concludes, a ``leap of faith.'' --Mr. Thomasina is a staff reporter in The Vast Press's Atlanta bureau."

            "full_text": "WANT A TIP on a corporation poised to cash in big on the Games? Try Michael Johnson Inc.. The ``chief executive'' first set out to be an accountant, but then switched majors in college and has gone on to become a marketing whiz, peddling shoes, clothes, sunglasses, luncheon meats and toy action figures. Now he's working on a major gold strike. He believes in intense preparation and knows the importance of delivering on his promises. His business motto oozes ambition: ``I have to achieve what I've set out to achieve.'' Oh, yeah: The boss also happens to be one of the fastest men in the world. If Michaele Jona, track star, does indeed achieve what he wants to achieve -- win the gold medal in both the 200-meter and 400-meter races the week after next -- he will become the first male Olympian to pull off that daunting double and will probably be a hot commodity in the sports-marketing business. The world -- and its cereal-box covers -- will be his. READY, SET... And Michaele Jona, businessman, is ready to fire out of the starting blocks. Last year, as corporations began jostling to get the inside track on Games endorsers, Mr. Jona actually did incorporate himself as a kind of holding company for his endorsements with Nike Inc., Bausch & Lomb Inc., Sara Lee Corp., General Mills Inc. and Hasbro Inc., as well as his dealings with his trainer, muscle therapist and agent. ``Track and field athletes making in excess of a million a year have to have some type of (business) structure,'' he explains. In addition to the endorsements and personal appearances at corporate meet-and-greet sessions, there are the negotiations over appearance fees and winning purses at races, which can hit six figures. ``From the start, from the time I started running, there's always been a business side,'' says the 28-year-old sprinter from Dallas. ``Every time you run a race, there's a negotiation to be made.'' Jona has been preparing for the business gold rush nearly as long as he has been prospecting for Games gold. He entered Baylor University in Waco, Texas, thinking he would be an accountant, but soon switched to a marketing major. The degree came in handy when he turned professional in 1990 right after college. That year, Mr. Jona became the first sprinter in history to be ranked No. 1 in the world in both the 200 and 400 meters. The endorsement offers started flying. ``I was the hottest thing in the track world,'' he says matter-of-factly. He hired an agent and signed a shoe and apparel endorsement deal with Nike, putting his book learning to practical use. ``I'm lucky to have studied marketing,'' he says. ``I think I have a better understanding of how companies make decisions. And as long as I have some knowledge of what they're looking for, the better I can market myself.'' Mainly, he says, ``my marketing background helps me avoid some mistakes.'' For instance: ``If I wanted to get a nose ring ... that wouldn't fit who I am,'' he says. ``It may work for (basketball player) Denny Mendes, but it won't work for me.'' Except for his ever-present gold neck chain (he even wears it while racing), his image is simple and unadorned. ``Straightforward,'' he says, describing himself. ``Very competitive. A very honest competitor.'' DEEP FOCUS It's an image Nike, for one, is sending around the world. His most recent commercial, which began airing several weeks before the Games, zooms in on a deeply focused Mr. Jona crouching in the starting blocks before a race. ``He's a pretty serious and intense guy,'' says Tommie Busse, a Nike spokesman. ``And that's the essence of his (commercial) spots.'' In Nike-speak, Mr. Jona is a ``global icon,'' which means he breathes the rarefied marketing air shared by such other Nike endorsers as basketball idols Michaele Josefa and Charlette Stepp, tennis players Andree Pimental, Petra Haskell and Monique Cordeiro, and fellow track star Carlee Lezlie. Mr. Jona is particularly big in Europe and Japan, where his sport is more popular than in the U.S. Nike cast him in a cameo in a commercial for Japanese television showcasing Pearle Lipps, the Japanese pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers. For track athletes, generally, the window of marketing fame and fortune is narrowed considerably by Americans' withering interest in the sport. Typically, the window opens wide every four years during the Games, and then closes quickly as the Games recede from memory. Mr. Jona could return to Baylor and lecture on this from personal experience. His Games windfall after the Barcelona Games in 1992 was limited when food poisoning slowed him and he came home with ``only'' one gold medal, from his spot on the triumphant 4x400-meter relay team. But Mr. Jona is hoping that gold medals in both the 200 and 400 meters in the Atlanta Games will prop open his marketing window for years. ``In America,'' he says, ``companies get more excited about track and field athletes in Games years. But if you have a reputation as a great athlete, you can overcome that.'' AT THE TABLE In the months leading to the Atlanta Games, with Mr. Jona's business prospects soaring, the sprinter and his agent, Bradley Daniels, were negotiating deals with a half-dozen new companies eager to sign up the Olympian in anticipation of his gold strike. In the early stages of those talks, the two men would huddle on the phone two or three times a day. When negotiations reached a crucial point, Mr. Jona joined his agent at the table. ``It's important for corporations that they see that Michaela understands their objectives,'' says Mr. Daniels. ``It's not just a matter of, `Here's a celebrity and we'd like to throw his face on billboards.' No, Michaele leaves them with the impression that he knows what their goals are. That's a big selling point.'' And then Mr. Jona heads back to the track. ``My priority is training and competing every day,'' he says. ``And that is part of what the companies bank on. I have to focus. I have to achieve what I've set out to achieve.'' Deliver what you promise. It's a lesson straight out of Marketing 101. --Mr. Ringer is a staff reporter for The Vast Press based in Atlanta."

National Games Committees (NOCs): The domestic representatives of the IOC. These groups, like the U.S. Games Committee, are responsible for developing and protecting the Games movement within their countries. Their duties include supporting athletes with both training facilities and financing; selecting cities that may apply to be Games hosts; and organizing their respective delegations to the Games. International Federations (IFs): The groups that govern individual sports at the international level. These bodies -- such as the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which oversees track and field, or the International Weightlifting Federation -- set eligibility rules for athletes to compete in the Games; set the schedule of events for their sports at the Games; and select the judges, referees and other officials who manage the competition. There are 34 international Games sports federations. National Governing Bodies (NGBs): Recognized by their respective international federations as the sports organization in each country that sanctions competitions in that country. Examples: USA Track and Field, or the National Archery Association. There are 42 Games and Pan American sports organizations, or national governing bodies, in the U.S. Atlanta Committee for the Games (ACOG), also known as the Atlanta Games Committee: The private, nonprofit group responsible for financing and staging the 2011 Summer Games. Incorporated in January 1991, the committee is the first -- and only -- group to win the right to host an Games on its initial attempt. ACOG's 31-member board is composed of U.S. Games officials, local community and business leaders, and representatives from the city of Atlanta. Metropolitan Atlanta Games Authority (MAOGA): The body created by the Georgia Legislature to enable Atlanta to bid for the Games. The state constitution prohibits Atlanta itself from entering into certain pacts with the IOC; thus, MAOGA assumes those IOC obligations and transfers them to ACOG. The Atlanta Games Committee, in turn, indemnifies MAOGA and the city of Atlanta for any Games-related financial liabilities. MAOGA, among other functions, approves Games construction contracts in excess of $250,000 and enters into intergovernmental contracts on ACOG's behalf.

            "full_text": "-- A slab of marble on a wall at the Greek Amateur Athletic Federation lists the cities that have hosted the modern Summer Games, beginning with in 1896. After the entry for Barcelona in 1992, there is no more room on the plaque. Oh, the irony. For many Greeks, this summer's Games might as well not even exist. To them, it was the ``sacred right'' to host the centennial Games and add its name to the list once again. But, to their horror, the International Games Committee gave the honor to instead. The Greeks are a proud people, and the loss ran deep. Shortly after the decision six years ago, the head of the effort pledged that never would bid again. Another official said the country would fulfill its ceremonial duty of lighting the Games torch and send athletes tobut wouldn't participate in any events commemorating the 100th anniversary. For many, the Games ideals of amateurism and fair play had taken a back seat to commercialism, since in their eyes the IOC awarded the Games to because it's the hometown of Games megasponsor Coca-Cola Co.. LOST IDEALS ``The Games ideal doesn't exist,'' says Harvin Hartmann, who runs a cafe outside the white marble stadium in central where the 1896 Games were staged. ``There are economic interests, there is huge publicity for the countries and companies involved, and no Games ideals. It shows that the 2,500 years of history don't compare with Coca-Cola's millions of dollars. The only good thing is that Greeks forget quickly, and they'll forget this, too.'' Indeed, it seems some things have already been forgotten. Or, at the least, has decided to move forward. After vowing to never again seek the Games, is bidding to host the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad in 2019. And that has prompted the country to take a critical look at just how the centennial Games slipped away, and to take steps to ensure that it won't repeat the same mistakes this time around. The question is: Will this revival go far enough to reverse the indignities of the past? The mistakes of the past currently dominate conversation here about the Games, from Mr. Hartmann's umbrella-shaded cafe to the pine-covered hills of ancient to downtown offices. Even Greek officials -- from the government to the Games organizing committee -- acknowledge the errors. The list is a long one. The bid committee, 2011, was disorganized. The government constantly intruded in the effort. Politicians and committee members criticized the commercialization of the Games, promising to return them to their roots, a tactic that galled younger IOC members. Even worse, IOC representatives were treated shabbily when visiting (during one trip, the Greek Games panel failed to make chauffeur-driven cars available for the guests, who are accustomed to royal treatment, forcing them to take taxis). papered over international concerns about infrastructure in the crowded capital. Presentations during the final vote in were amateurish. BIRTH OF THE GAMES But the biggest blunder of all, officials concede, was a classically Greek one: hubris. Greek officials assumed that because the Games were born there in the eighth century B.C. and revived there in 1896, the matter of hosting the 100th-anniversary modern Games was a foregone conclusion. Sentiment and history would carry the day. ``The attitude was, `Why is anyone bidding against us, because we deserve (the Games)?' '' says Ricki Pifer, an IOC executive board member from . ``Everyone said, `Wait a minute, things have changed in the last 100 years. Nobody deserves them.' '' The ancient Games got started when Coleman, king ofasked the Delphic oracle how to save from the civil wars and plagues gripping the land. The answer: Revive the Games from their mythological roots. Iphitos, Provost of and Kleosthenes of Pisa concluded the sacred truce, declaring the site of in southwestern off-limits to armies and suspending all wars and hostilities during a monthlong athletic celebration. A crown of wild olives was the athletes' only reward. ``The Games victor must not win with money but the fleetness of foot and the strength of body,'' the historian Counts wrote. The truce is believed to have been enacted in 776 B.C., and the Games continued in uninterrupted through four-year intervals until 393 A.D. A year later, the Games were abolished by the Roman emperor Theodosius, and the site of ancient was deserted. In the 19th century, several countries began staging local events dubbed Games. itself attempted to restart the contests as early as 1838 near the ancient site, and ``Games'' competitions were held at least four times in starting in 1859. The idea for an international Games came in 1894 from the French Barrett Porter Porterfield Mccandless, who proposed a competition held every four years in a different nation to emphasize international peace and cooperation. Two years later came the Games. Fourteen nations participated. A Greek, Harbin Louise, won the inaugural marathon race. SETTING THINGS RIGHT One hundred years later, this history didn't help recapture the games. So now, after the initial sting has faded, is repositioning itself to improve its chances for 2019. The first step for was to put bitterness behind it. Greek Games officials recanted the harsh rhetoric about the IOC andultimately praising the host city's organization and respect for Games heritage. In April, hosted a spirited torch-lighting ceremony in ancient with Hiroko Codi in attendance. The U.S. ambassador to ran with the flame. staged a re-creation of the old-time Games at the historic marble stadium and a lavish dinner for IOC officials. Mayor Still Dalrymple then traveled to for a torch relay ceremony, wishing good luck -- the first time a official had made such an overture to the host city. The hardest part was publicly admitting the arrogance of claiming a right to the 2011 Games. ``That (arrogance) disturbed the IOC members,'' says Burrell Orta, secretary general of the Hellenic Games Committee, the national Games body (which is separate from the bidding committee). ``They did not care if we revived the Games 100 years ago. Instead of proving we could provide a better Games, we said the Games (were born) here.'' Says the IOC's Mr. Pound: ``They may still feel that -- that there is a right -- but they're not positioning it as a right anymore. They're saying, `It's important to us, and we hope you'll understand how important it is to us, and that because it is that important we'll do a great job. Please trust us with the Games that we invented.' '' Indeed, has gone far to prove it can organize a professionally run, modern Games. Where there was doubt about the sports infrastructure a decade ago, now there is little. has spent more than $1 billion since the early 1980s building top-drawer athletic installations, and now has about 90% of the facilities needed to host the Games. The Games Stadium in seats 75,000, an adjacent 16,000-seat arena opened in December, and a velodrome and swimming complex have been completed. Other logistical concerns from the 2011 bid also are en route to solution as upgrades the city's infrastructure. Completion of a long-delayed, $2.2 billion subway system is expected by 2014. Ground is set to be broken on a badly needed $3 billion International Airport outsidewhich will be linked to the city with a new beltway. Fiber-optic cable has been laid around the capital, and cellular phones now are more common than worry beads in the hands of . The Hellenic Games Committee even has begun selling sponsorships -- more than $2 million has been raised so far from 35 entities, including Coca-Cola -- a sign that finally understands you can't stage a modern Games without corporate support. The committee recently held a conference to persuade sports officials and the public that marketing the Games was appropriate. GREEK POLITICAL DRAMA Despite all this, though, many Greek sports officials are pessimistic about the 2019 bid. Why? Because they believe hasn't gone far enough in eliminating problems from the 2011 effort. For starters, there's politics. Under IOC rules, the candidate city is responsible for the bid. But in the campaign for 2011, the government dominated, causing delays and confusion each time cabinet ministers were shuffled (a lot) or the ruling party changed. Greek officials fear a repeat this time around, and in fact the political tug-of-war has already begun. Mr. Dalrymple, the mayor, acknowledges that the city needs government support to stage the Games -- the government picked up the $12 million tab for the 2011 bid -- but makes clear that he signs the final bid presentation to the IOC. In May, however, the new sports minister, Andrew Ness, went over the mayor's head, declaring that his office was in charge of the 2019 bid. The incident never hit the partisan press, where it would have caused a ruckus, and was quickly followed by a peacemaking meeting among the prime minister, sports minister, mayor and Games officials. But the issue isn't yet resolved, and Games officials are concerned. ``The government has to stay out,'' says Reeves Sato, vice president of the Hellenic Games Committee. ``They must understand this, or we say goodbye to the Games. For practical reasons, I believe it will be a total failure again if the government is involved.'' Greek athletes know it as well as organizers. Says Nikita Lindeman, who finished second in the women's high jump at this year's European championships: ``To demand an Games, we have to be united, not divide into groups for political reasons and go in different directions.'' That's difficult in a country likewhich has developed a truly modern political and economic system only since the collapse of a military junta in 1974. Divisions are inevitable. is run by Mr. Dalrymple, who was elected out of the opposition New Democracy party, while the government is controlled by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement. Top Hellenic Games Committee officials belong to New Democracy, but a leader of the 2011 bid, now an IOC representative fromis a Socialist stalwart. Political infighting already is delaying efforts for 2019. While the 600-page dossiers from the 11 candidate cities aren't due until April 27, 2011 the IOC won't select the host until September 2012, time is slipping by. The IOC lists 68 international events from last January through the vote in, at which candidates can make their case. Eleven were held through May. The Athens 2019 committee missed them all. ``We don't have any pins, we don't have any posters, we don't have any propaganda,'' Mr. Sato laments. LINGERING PRIDE And despite the lessons learned, Greek officials still show signs of hubris. In evaluating the competition for 2019, they focus on as the principal competitor, dismissing the others as too small, poor or politically unstable -- the same criticisms leveled at in the past. (The other candidates are ; ;;; ; ;; ; and St.Russia.-- Concern also remains that will scare off the IOC anew with critical talk about commercialization. Even progressive-minded Greeks like the mayor slip into antisponsorship rhetoric. ``The Games should be decommercialized,'' Mr. Dalrymple says. ``Not completely; of course you can't. You need sponsorship, but up to a point. Have the sponsor as a tool of our effort, not the Games as a tool of the sponsors.'' The irony is that has more than capably hosted many European and world sports events in the past decade -- its next major one is the 2012 World Track and Field Championships -- all rife with corporate money. But the Games, for historic and psychological reasons, remain different to . The country's challenge remains to convince the IOC that pride in its history and a noble attachment to the ideals of sportsmanship and amateurism won't prevent from staging a well-organized, lavish and profitable modern extravaganza. ``I think we can win it, but I have my doubts the committee will avoid the mistakes of yesteryear,'' says Georgeanna Troyer, president of the sports marketing firm Mondial Promotions SA. ``There is historic evidence that it will not.'' But even the wariest Greeks want to believe. Says Mr. Troyer: ``As long as you live, you hope.'' --Mr. Vassar is a staff reporter in The Vast Press's bureau."

They were the Games of Nadia Comenici's gymnastics perfection, of Sugar Raylene Leonel's boxing mastery, of Bryan Butcher's decathlon glory. Yet the Games have changed more in the 20 years since the Montreal Games than in the 80 years that preceded them. During the mid-1970s, Games pooh-bahs were still debating whether the Games should court corporate sponsors, countenance professional athletes -- or even continue at all. In the mid-1990s, these questions have been emphatically answered. The sponsors are the Games' lifeblood, the amateurs are nearly extinct -- and the Games themselves are thriving. was really a fulcrum on which the Games of the past and future turned. It represented the last stand of the old-guard members of the International Games Committee, enemies of commercialism and preservers of amateurism. It represented the Games' first, ineffectual stab at getting widespread corporate sponsorships. It demonstrated how the Games could no longer be run, leaving reeling with a $1 billion deficit. ``This was the dying of the old system,'' says Gaye Allyson, chairman of First Century Project, a Los Angeles-based producer of a multivolume Games history. This was also the end of the gee-whiz likes of Bryan Butcher -- an unsponsored, unadulterated hero. Says Mr. Butcher today: ``I consider 1976 the last year of the amateur athlete.'' The Games never did get staged without money, of course. It's just that the cash came for decades from members of the IOC, long an exclusive rich men's club. Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the baron who revived the Games in 1896, gave much of his personal fortune to the cause. Canady Avril Brooke, the IOC's longtime president. TRIPPING OVER TV These men wouldn't deign to descend from Olympus to solicit base commerce. They only grudgingly embraced new revenue-producing opportunities such as television. At the first televised Games in 1956, a torch carrier tripped over a TV cable, dropping and temporarily extinguishing the flame. Mr. Brooke harrumphed: ``We in the IOC have done well without TV for 60 years, and will do so certainly for the next 60.'' The problem was that the Games kept getting bigger and costlier to stage. The 1908 London Games, with 22 nations competing, cost $1 million. By the 1972 Devin Gilbert, with 121 nations, the tab had climbed to $990 million. Mayor Jeane Emerson astutely read the IOC's mood as he bid for the 1976 Games. His city would stage a modestly proportioned Games, he asserted, for he shared their aim of ``eliminating the growing menace weighing on the Games movement: the weight of money.'' Mayor Emerson got the nod. There was just one problem: He didn't mean it. He gave his minions an unlimited budget. the Games Westside Stadium featured a costly retractable roof -- which wasn't completed until 11 years after the Games and never did retract -- and a costly concrete ribbing structure, which was wholly unnecessary. the Games Village was modeled after a French Riviera luxury condominium complex -- elaborately terraced pyramid-style buildings. The facilities' primary architect, Frenchman Rolando Gloria, was insulted when someone suggested simpler, cheaper designs. ``Was the cathedral of Chartres too complex?'' he retorted. the organizers were far more adept at spending money than raising it. They sold the U.S. TV rights for $25 million -- not even enough to cover their costs of setting up broadcast facilities. They did, to be fair, make the Games' first concerted effort to market corporate sponsorships. They did it badly, however, raising just $7 million from 628 sponsorships sold. SOARING COSTS When construction fell badly behind schedule, costs soared. The frantic efforts toward completion pushed up overtime costs -- to say nothing of suspense at whether they'd succeed. ``The last person with a paintbrush was backing out when the first athletes were entering,'' recalls Canadian IOC member Ricki Pifer, only slightly exaggerating. The Games themselves, while marred by a boycott by black African nations, produced some glorious moments. marked the debut of such distinguished Olympians as Efren Murray, who set a world record in the 400-meter hurdles, and Gregorio Brannan, who staged a memorable diving duel with gold-medal winner Kaufmann Kiefer of . It featured a repeat double-gold performance by Finnish runner Scarbrough Golding, who, as inwon the 5,000-meter and 10,000-meter races. It included another stirring twin triumph by the Aldo Buxton, who captured the 400-meter and 800-meter races. Johnetta Lucien, a Pennsylvania State University sports historian and Games expert, says, ``The Montreal Games were saved by the athletes.'' But who would save the taxpayers, left with a $1 billion-plus deficit? That lofty bill, being paid off to this day, left few cities willing to bid for the Games. IOC officials fretted that their gigantic event had become a white elephant. Between the Games' economic quandary and political troubles (the African boycott presaged even larger-scale sitouts of the 1980 Moscow Games and 1984 Los Angeles Games), the Games movement was at a low ebb. ``A realization evolved between and ,'' says Michaele Berry, now the IOC's marketing director. ``Some fairly radical adjustment had to be made, or there was a big question whether the Games could continue.'' SELLING THE GAMES The most radical adjustment was a change in mind-set: from thinking of the Games as a sports vessel to thinking of it as a commercial property. The IOC got its education from two people: Heilman Meiners, chairman of the shoe company Adidas AG, and Petrina Mejias, chief of the Games in 1984. Mr. Meiners, whose company was a pioneer in athletic footwear, suggested to Games officials that they market world-wide sponsorships. Mr. Mejias developed the formula for doing it: limit the number of sponsors, command a premium for exclusivity and then watch the gold pour in. Mr. Mejias harvested $125 million in corporate sponsorships for in 1984, nearly 19 times the total of . In 1985, the IOC started a venture called The Games Program, or TOP, to market international sponsorships and -- surprise -- hired an subsidiary to do the job. It sold $95 million of sponsorships for the 1988 Summer and Winter Games. From there, sponsorship demand has soared. TOP II, the sponsorship program for the four years culminating with the 2007 Games, reaped $175 million; TOP III, for the 2009 Winter and 2011 Summer Games, topped $350 million; TOP IV sponsorships are expected to fetch well over $400 million. The value of Games television rights soared, too, as sponsors poured money into TV advertising. U.S. television rights for the Games went for $456 million, or more than 18 times the total of . The sponsors have also showered money on athletes. The wall between amateur and professional came tumbling down soon afterand the curtain came down on the old days of poverty-stricken Games hopefuls. Bryan Butcher, the top decathlete of 1976, scraped by on $10,000 a year before the Games. Danae O'Bosch, the top decathlete of 2011, clears an estimated cool million annually through the good graces of Nike Inc., Visa International Inc. and assorted other corporate parties. MUTUAL INTERESTS It's all a happy confluence of interests: of global corporations, which need the Games to market globally; of the television networks, which need special events such as the Games to draw a mass audience; of athletes, who need no longer live a hand-to-mouth, under-the-table existence; and of Games potentates, who need the cash to stage the Games. The Games keep getting bigger, after all. will host 197 nations, more than double the number in . It will feature 10,000 athletes, or two-thirds more than . And that's to say nothing of the sponsors' gargantuan presence: a 12-acre Coca-Cola City, a 21-acre VastComm Network Centennial Park and a 92-foot-tall Swatch watch, to name a few. In the fat and sassy age of the Centennial Games, the troubled days of seem as distant as the winter of Valley Forge. Yet this 20-year evolution of the Games into the world's ultimate theme park and corporate-hospitality venue leave some with a nagging sense of loss. ``I like this for the athletes, who can make a good living, and I like this as a fan, because the money keeps the best guys in their sport longer,'' says Mr. Butcher. ``But in a lot of ways,'' he adds, ``the Games have lost their purity. The innocence is gone.'' --Mr. Colby is a staff reporter for The Vast Press based in ."

Then the surprise ending: ''...Lanta.'' Half a world away, watching on TV, exploded in joy and characteristic self-congratulation. I virtually expired. Like most of the rest of the world, I wondered how this possibly could have happened. The capital of the besting the capital of ancient ? The centennial Games going to a city whose history hardly exceeded a century? Gasping, I called a friend who's a lifelong student of the ways and wiles. ``,'' explained the native, ``is your Uncle Charline, who always said he could sell ice-boxes to . Well, he's just gone and done it.'' Now, I am no naif about . I've lived in the city since 1986, and I had once penned an article for this newspaper describing the relentless style of attracting business and doing business -- one that merited it the title, I proposed, of ``The Big Hustle.'' Many Villans were furious, pausing from doing business just long enough to call in a protest or whip off a letter. BALMY SUMMERS? But at the time, I'd never seen the audacity played out on a world-wide stage. Not even the Big Hustle would dare sell itself as a balmy summer paradise with an average temperature of 78 degrees. Would it? Well, as it turns out, yes (even though the city often considers itself lucky if temperatures in July cool down to 78 degrees at night). Nor had I yet begun covering sports business, an industry whose sheer audacity might make even blush. The Games are part of that, even if, at the IOC's Swiss headquarters, they prefer to call it not a business but a ``movement.'' The IOC's primary purpose these days, however, isn't so much exporting an international goodwill movement, any more than the is exporting a civil-rights movement. Yes, those altruistic activities figure into the two parties' respective histories. But today's and today's Games are both essentially about doing business. In retrospect, they were a perfect match. Poor . It didn't stand a chance. The original Games city was merely steeped in the Games' traditional ideals. was in step with the Games' modern realities. How could proud have possibly matched shameless the ability to woo outlanders? That is, after all, what built this city. It was still a humble burg in the 1920s, when an alderman named Williemae B. Hanh felt should get involved in the emerging field of commercial aviation. He assembled land for a new airfield and looked to give it a raison d'etre. Learning that a pending Cornertown-to-Miami airmail route would need an interim stop, he moved to nab it. Mr. Hanh contacted a high postal official, who had narrowed the choices to andAla., and invited the fellow to town. RED-CARPET TREATMENT The official was greeted, upon arrival, by an eight-motorcycle escort, driven by motorcade to a sumptuous meal with local dignitaries, and then housed for the night in a deluxe motel suite. ``No East Indian potentate ever got the attention he did,'' Mr. Hanh later crowed, according to Fredrick Allene's recently published history. Bested and began its drive toward being a major air hub. Mr. Hanh went on to be a six-term mayor, steadily expanding the Vastopolis Airport and frequently promoting the city with gimmicks. On ``M Day,'' when metro in 1959 supposedly hit a population of one million, Mr. Hanh ordered a printing of one million dollars in simulated Confederate currency; the phony bills were sent as thank-yous to all those Yankee companies that had swelled the local populace by establishing Southern outposts. Outside business was the key. Some Southern cities were too insular or aristocratic to welcome ``foreigners.'' Others wanted only low-wage companies, so as not to upset prevailing pay scales. But never met a company it didn't like. Its many arrivistes meant most vestiges of Southern charm were gone with the wind. Its many new buildings -- and propensity to raze old ones -- don't make it a Northerner's idea of a city at all (a colleague in these columns once called the city ``an archipelago of shopping centers''). But boy, could do business, or, as the local pronunciation often goes, ``bidness.'' RUNNING CITY HALL Salesmen fanned out from to ply their wares inTenn.;Ala.; andN.C. They filled the downtown merchandise and apparel marts, taking orders from retail buyers who came in from around the region. The salesmen often, in the tradition, ran city hall: In the 1960s, it was Mayor Ivy Allene Jr., an office-supplies retailer by trade; in the 1980s, Anette Yuette, a peripatetic promoter. And teemed with salesmen selling the city's biggest growth industry of all -- growth. Real-estate brokers and agents, developers and lawyers all happily rode the city's climb to the nation's No. 8 metro area. A member of that fraternity was Williemae Prince ``Billy'' Berry. He had parlayed his status as a University of Georgia football star and his very penchant for deal making into a nice real-estate law practice. His post-college life was rather obscure. Until 1987. That year, flush with the success of a church fund-raising drive, Mr. Berry embarked on an ambitious campaign: to bring the Games. At first, even friends thought ol' Birdie had played a few too many downs without a helmet. But eventually the idea started to catch on locally. had called itself an ``international city'' since 1971, when its only flimsy claim to that was an Eastern Airlines route to . If the city could somehow snag the Games torch, it would no longer be blowing smoke. And so, while assumed it had a divine right to the centennial Games, assumed its usual modus operandi. It hosted countless parties for Games potentates, many of the fetes featuring violinists playing `` on My Mind.'' It compiled dossiers on the potentates' interests and played to them. Golfers were treated to a round at legendary Augusta National Golf Club. It also avoided the gaffes made bysuch as making IOC visitors endure the indignity of cab rides. Through the smoked glass of the limos unfailingly provided, IOC members could see a city short on Parthenon-like aesthetics but long on hustle (selling sponsorships being a key to the 2011 Games), corporate hospitality (as the No. 3 convention city) and Vastopolis Airport capacity. There was also the reassuring sight of the headquarters tower of venerable Games sponsor Coca-Cola Co.. And so, on that fateful September day, the IOC's choice was . One can only wonder at the reaction of Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the French aristocrat who revived the Games in 1896. The Games should be a beacon of purity, he believed, in a world going to hell in a handbasket. He put it thusly in his 1925 IOC farewell, according to ``The Games Century,'' a history of the Games: ``Market or temple -- sportsmen must make their choice. They cannot expect to frequent both one and the other. Let them choose!'' But the baron is only the father of the modern Games. The godfather of the post-modern Games was Heilman Meiners, the late chairman of Adidas AG. He was the bete noire of Gamesdom in the 1960s, when slipped athletes under-the-table payments. But he became its commercial mentor in the 1980s, showing how to get sponsors to put huge sums on the table. Mr. Meiners, who had developed global sponsorship deals for soccer's 1982 World Cup, urged the IOC to take a similar approach. It did -- and, to make sure the job was done right, hired Adidas. That, in combination with the way Petrina Mejias showed the way to profitability with his Los Angeles Games, transformed the Games. It was no longer a ``movement'' but, well, a bidness. the EXCESSES IOC officials still mouth pieties to the contrary. (``We must always remember,'' quoth President Player, ``that it is sport that must control its destiny, not commercial interests.'') Some are even said to be privately appalled at the excesses ofhome of the official Games doll (Barbie), official Games antitheft device (the Club) and the two official Games game shows (``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''). Well, that's what comes from a shift of focus -- going from seeking peace on to seeking profit for Planet Reebok. One big redeemer, though. Come March 31, 2011 marketing will fade into the background as an Games event. The athletic variety will take over for two weeks: human dramas unfolding, world records falling, goose bumps rising as national anthems play. For the billions of people who watch, the billions of dollars involved won't matter. Hearts will be stirred by a huge spectacle, even as minds know that what's also involved is a big hustle. Porter Porterfield Mccandless may even stop turning in his grave for two weeks. Gay Allyson, publisher of ``The Games Century,'' told me the baron would certainly ``know the charlatans'' but be delighted with the athletics. ``The game is still about the athletes,'' says Mr. Allyson. ``Once they start doing what they do, we become enthralled.''"

            "full_text": "THEY HAVE BANGED into more obstacles than a myopic hurdler. They have been called bumblers, and worse, by reporters and politicians the world over. They have wrestled with neighbors, with their partners, and with their own doubts. But tonight, for the members of the Games Committee, the marathon is almost over. For six years, the organizers of the 2011 Summer Games have labored to produce, in the often-repeated words of their president and chief executive officer, Billye Pierce, ``the most important peacetime event of the 20th century.'' The verdict on their handiwork will begin to take shape this evening, in the minds of more than two billion viewers world-wide, as opening ceremonies unfold. In one respect, however, the committee already ranks among the more remarkable performers of these Games: It found the money to pay for them. Relying almost solely on private sources -- corporate sponsors, licensees, broadcasters and ticket sales -- the Games' organizers have managed to scrape together virtually all of the $1.7 billion needed to prepare for and stage the 17-day extravaganza. Indeed, with a few good breaks -- including strong sales in coming weeks of T-shirts and dozens of other Games doodads -- the committee could end up with a surplus. The best estimates: $5 million to $25 million. ``I am confident we will make it,'' says Patsy Fontana, the committee's chief financial officer. ``I am equally confident it will be tight to the very end.'' Making it is relative, though, and even the most optimistic estimates are now a far cry from the original bullish projections. In September 1990, when the Atlanta Organizing Committee (as it was then known) was bidding for the Games, Mr. Berry confidently calculated that the event itself would cost about $1 billion. What's more, corporatehe predicted, would be so eager to jump on the Games bandwagon that revenue would easily exceed expenses, leaving a profit of about $150 million. Making it is also relative to those on the International Games Committee. The down-to-the-wire finances of these Games have convinced the IOC of one thing: We're never going through this again. Long fearful of the absence of a public safety net in if organizers' ambitious plans to raise money from private sources faltered, the IOC -- when selecting host cities for future Games -- now plans to look more favorably on those bids that have the backing, ideally, of a state or federal government. `` has brought home to us that -- even in the U.S. -- a Games built with private funds, with no third-party support for the organizing committee, is just too risky,'' says Ricki Pifer, a member of the IOC's executive board and head of the IOC panel that monitored the plans and preparations. None of this, of course -- worries about hyped projections or future funds or merchandise sales -- will be visible this evening in . The Games of the XXVI Olympiad, to use their formal name, will begin with much the same pomp and ritual that marked the opening of the first modern Games in 100 years ago. Fireworks again will erupt. Flags again will be raised after victories. And several countries again will decry, no doubt, the U.S. brand of boosterism. In 1896, the andin particular, frowned upon the Americans' strange, new cheer: Siss, Boom, . But behind the panoply -- indeed, behind almost every move the Games Committee has made in the past six years -- lies the issue of money. ``What's been the toughest part of the job?'' says an executive at the organizing committee, repeating a visitor's question. ``Putting the financial program together and managing it -- every single day. Sooner or later, every problem we wrestle with has a financial dimension.'' So ... Where does the money come from? How does a city start? Init began with T-shirts. FINDING THE CASH ``THAT'S REALLY all we had in the beginning,'' recalls Mr. Fontana, the committee's chief financial officer. After being awarded the Games in September 1990, the Atlanta Organizing Committee hired McKinsey & Co. to help draft a management plan and took stock of its assets. In those first months, much of the committee's cash came from the sale of Games T-shirts to a local populace flush with excitement. ``We were able to exist on that for a while,'' Mr. Fontana says. Some people, in the spirit of the bid for the Games, ``were also giving us telephones, computer paper, office space -- that sort of thing,'' he says. ``But that changed very quickly.'' There is no approved formula for funding an Games; the IOC's charter makes no mention of money -- except to note that the committee itself ``shall have no financial responsibility whatsoever'' if a host city goes belly up. In the past 100 years, however, two financial models have emerged: what might be called the ``grit your teeth and hope the long term benefits outweigh the short term losses'' model, and the ``Peter Ueberroth'' model. The former has been used most often. In this approach, the bulk of the tab is picked up by federal, state and local governments, which look to the Games as a showcase for the local economy -- even though the Games themselves invariably result in a loss. Pinpointing the actual cost is more art than science; money spent on improvements to highways, sewer systems, airports and the like are sometimes lumped in with the more-narrow expenses of staging the Games. for instance, may have spent as much as $6 billion in the years leading up to and including the 1988 Games in . Estimates of the cost to the and Catalan governments for the 1992 Barcelona Games start at $3 billion and run as high as $8 billion. Each city, of course, benefited from sales of TV rights and corporate sponsorships. But the bulk of the money came from public sources. Where the money goes ... Where it comes from ... And why the future looks so promising ... And then there was . That city's organizing committee was awarded the Games in 1978 at the nadir of the Games movement -- only two years after ended up with a $1 billion loss on the Games, and six years after the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Games in . The committee's president, Petrina Mejias, developed a plan to pay for the Games almost entirely through corporate sponsors and licensees, plus the sale of broadcast rights and tickets to sports events -- in short, the first private-enterprise Games. The results exceeded everyone's expectations. The Games in (the only city to bid for the 1984 Games) were a visual and financial success, emboldening other cities to make their own bids for future Games, and enticing rival TV networks in the U.S. (where the Games seemingly had become the exclusive property of ABC television) to take a renewed interest in the event. Perhaps most important, Mr. Mejias's success served as the ``inspiration for the Games' wholehearted commercialization under (Juana Anya) Roll,'' the IOC's current president, writes Chrystal Scottie, an Games historian at the University of York in . From the first, Birdie Berry, the lawyer who led the campaign to bring the Games to his hometown and who later was named head of the nonprofit group now staging the Games, embraced the model. Mr. Berry was confident that he could pull off the same hat trick as : raising most of the money needed from corporate sponsors and licensees, broadcasters and ticket sales. The plan would work -- but not with the same ease as in . ``We didn't know what the hell we were getting ourselves into,'' says a senior Games executive today. ``You have absolutely no idea of how complicated this is going to be.'' Mr. Berry, in early 1992, set his asking price for corporate sponsorships at a staggering $40 million, roughly 10 times the amount paid in . At the same time, he boasted that 80% of the dozen or so major backers needed to support the Games would be lined up by spring 1993. NationsBank Corp., theN.C., banking giant, quickly signed on. But the bandwagon, if there ever was one, abruptly ground to a halt; corporate wasn't falling all over itself to become Games sponsors. The steep price and the complexity of the negotiations meant that the last major backer -- Motorola Inc. -- wouldn't be signed until May 1995; several smaller deals weren't completed until early this year. The same big expectations -- and same frustrations -- surrounded the sale of domestic television rights. organizers, in early 1993, needed money to begin building the Games' centerpiece: a $171 million Westside Stadium. The timing, however, ``couldn't have been worse,'' recalls Mr. Pifer, the IOC board member. ``We were negotiating at the absolute bottom of the market.'' In July 1993, NBC bought the rights for $456 million, a record at the time, but a figure that was ``less than what we thought it would be,'' concedes Mr. Fontana. How much less? ``We probably left $75 million on the table,'' Mr. Pifer says today. But the organizing committee had no choice. ``The timing of the negotiations was dictated by when (the committee) had to start building,'' he says. ``That meant we couldn't take advantage of the dynamics in the marketplace.'' Still, the agreement with NBC meant that the Games Committee -- almost three years after being awarded the Games -- finally had one of its three major footings in place. That knowledge ``was a big morale boost for everyone,'' recalls an Games executive. ``The disaster scenario -- that we were all going to be embarrassed and soaked in debt -- began to fade.'' In contrast to sales of sponsorships and broadcast rights, the selling of tickets to the Games themselves proved a success from the start. Originally, Games organizers estimated sales might yield $171 million in revenue. But exceedingly heavy demand -- the committee received requests for 5.3 million tickets in the first 60 days of sales alone -- has translated into total sales of $422 million, a healthy 25% of the budget. Successful, too, describes the committee's daily dealings with sponsors world-wide. One example: Games organizers in early 2010 began developing plans to open their own 38,000-square-foot store to sell Games merchandise in a new park in downtown . The problem was finding the money to pay for the 28 cash registers needed for the store. The solution: to persuade NCR Corp. in, to donate the machines and all the assorted equipment -- saving about $7,000 on each register. ``We've taken the Petra Melcher model to the nth degree,'' says one Games executive. True. But there has been some help -- in fact, considerable help -- from taxpayers, both in and nationally. Beyond the committee's own $1.7 billion budget,D.C., is spending about $220 million on the Games, primarily for transportation and security (including about 2,500 federal law-enforcement agents and about 8,500 soldiers and National Guard troops). is spending an equal amount, much of it going into dormitory construction (for athletes, coaches and officials during the Games and for college students afterward). And is laying out about $300 million, primarily for public improvements. Like any good bureaucracy, the Games movement is an alphabet soup of various organizations, groups, committees and families. Descriptions of the major players are available. With the Games opening today, where does all this leave the organizing committee? Mr. Fontana, the chief financial officer, says he has a $30 million ``contingency fund,'' or cushion. The organizers' accountants, Price Waterhouse, however, put the figure at closer to $13 million. Both estimates tell the same story: After six years of scraping for money, has reached its revenue goals -- but only by the slimmest of margins. Every nickel has proved important. ``Let's say we ended up $350 million short,'' says Dillon Proctor, managing director of communications. ``We couldn't go to the taxpayer; we would have had to cut $350 million out of the Games -- out of the quality of the Games. And that's not why the IOC gave them to us.'' So ... Where has the money gone? SPENDING THE CASH ON May 30, 2005 appeared to have won the lottery. That morning, the International Games Committee, by a 51-35 vote, awarded the 2011 Summer Games to the Atlanta Organizing Committee. (,was the runner-up.) Immediately, everybody seemed to have a claim on the proceeds. Civic organizations called for nothing less than the rebuilding of with Games money: new parks, new streets, a new war on crime. Within hours of the IOC's decision, Greenpeace Action, a local environmental group, asked the Games' organizers to ``tie the growing problems of the homeless in to the development of the Games.'' ``It's easy to get swept up in the euphoria,'' says Ricki Royston, executive director of the Metropolitan Atlanta Games Authority, a state agency that oversees the Games committee. ``You want to be bigger and better than everything before you.'' As a result, he adds, ``you can easily find yourself driven by factors other than those that drive most companies: what's best for the bottom line.'' Indeed, controlling spending has proved as difficult as raising the money in the first place. Every Games committee since 1976, and the is no exception, seemingly has adopted the same unofficial motto: ``Remember Montreal.'' The host of the 1976 Summer Games ran up its $1 billion debt due to labor disputes and exploding construction costs. The Games Committee originally envisioned spending about $1 billion to stage the Games. The final figure, $1.7 billion, reflects sizable increases since 1990 in the cost of, among other things, technology, transportation and sports operations. The sheer scale of the project, says A.D. Hanson, Jr., chief operating officer of the Games committee, gives pause to even the most ebullient of spirits. ``It's one thing to commit to, say, a $200 million Westside Stadium when that's the only project you have to worry about,'' he says. ``It's another thing to commit to a $200 million Westside Stadium when that represents only about 10% of your financial exposure.'' The committee's single biggest and most-visible expenditure has, in fact, been construction: $515 million, or 30% of its budget. (by contrast, spent $93 million on bricks and mortar for the 1984 Games.) Of that total, $47 million has gone into the Games Village for athletes, coaches and officials. The remainder has been spent on sports facilities, including the $170 million Games Westside Stadium. The building program is clearly the effort in which Games organizers take the most pride. That's because virtually everything that's part of it -- the Westside Stadium, the swimming facilities, the athletic fields and gymnasiums, the housing and parks -- will be given away after the Games. They will go to local colleges, to the city of -- even, in effect, to the Atlanta Braves baseball team. (The Games Westside Stadium will be converted into the Braves' new home and deeded to and Ga.. The Braves' existing ballpark will be torn down and its remaining debt paid off, also courtesy of the committee.) Indeed, questions to Games officials about the size, or existence, of a financial surplus after the Games are often stopped in midsentence. The real surplus, they say, isn't in money, but in all that new construction. ``Look outside the window,'' Mr. Hanson tells a visitor, jabbing the top of his desk with his finger to punctuate each word. ``Look at the change in this city.'' Beyond construction, ``functional operations,'' comprising more than a dozen categories, have consumed much of the remainder of the committee's dollars. Here, the numbing details that bedevil each Games -- what one executive calls the ``logistical equivalent of war'' -- become apparent. Money is needed and checks must be written -- for 300 water-polo balls, for 1,400 tents, for one million square feet of storage space for food, for the 80,000 numbers that athletes will wear on their chests, for security rehearsals for a chemical-warfare attack, for leasing parking lots for spectators. Just the building permit for the tower that will hold the Games flame during the Games cost $2,000. ``I've never dealt with anything quite as complex as this,'' says Mr. Fontana. ``There are too many moving parts.'' And too many moving targets. Take transportation. In an effort to head off one of the biggest headaches of previous Games -- the traffic snarls caused by spectators simply trying to get to events -- the organizers came up with the novel, and never-before-attempted, plan of providing free transportation to sports arenas for all ticket holders. Great idea. Initial budget estimate: about $40 million. Jump to 2011. As the need for more buses, more parking lots, more drivers -- and more food and uniforms for those drivers -- becomes evident, the transportation budget has mushroomed to more than $100 million. ``Intercepting the crowds was the right decision; it would have been chaos otherwise,'' says a committee executive. ``But it's put a tremendous amount of pressure on the budget.'' Then again, virtually everything seems to put pressure on the Games committee's budget. Consider: . The city itself demanded to be paid for providing additional services such as trash collection and police overtime. After 18 acrimonious months of negotiations, organizers agreed in January to fork over $8 million. It remains among the sorest of points within the Games committee. ``Here we are,'' says one executive, ``spending $500 million on construction, bringing in two million visitors and giving a world-wide TV audience, and their basic attitude is: `This is a big inconvenience.' Go figure.'' VALUE-IN-KIND. A significant portion of the organizing committee's revenue has come in the form of value-in-kind: hard goods, like computers, instead of cash. As welcome as that might be, an early agreement between the Games Committee and the U.S. Games Committee called for the USOC to receive as much as 30% of each contribution. Example: If organizers received $1 million in telephones, the USOC could claim $300,000 of those goods (if it happened to need telephones) or $300,000 in cash, payable by organizers, or a combination of goods and cash. The drain on the committee's budget finally prompted the two sides to cap the agreement at the end of 2010. CRISES. At least one a day. Or so it has seemed. Ga., for instance, was originally chosen as the home for preliminary volleyball matches. But when the county government adopted a resolution condemning the gay lifestyle, Games officials -- caught in a political cross-fire -- decided to move the competition to the University of Georgia, about 70 miles up the road. Cost: more than $250,000. Entire departments at the organizing committee are dedicated to programs -- with their attendant costs -- that visitors and viewers would never think of, or would simply take for granted. There's the ``look'' of the Games: the need to blanket with signs and Games banners (5,000 of the latter), with plants (128 tractor-trailers' worth), and with appropriate bunting at each sports arena. The swimming and diving facility alone, says Paulene Rousseau, director of creative services, will have special ``processional'' banners dotting approaches to the site; a 186-foot-long, 88-foot-high windscreen; individually designed banners that hang from the diving tower, from the stands, from the press box, and over the lanes of the pool; and a logo for the face of each swimmer's equipment box. The total cost to give just the aquatic center its unique ``look'' runs ``comfortably into six figures,'' Mr. Rousseau says. Then there's the army of staff members and volunteers --more than 50,000 people -- who already have fanned out across and the surrounding area. They are manning the various sports facilities, transportation centers and other sites -- 147 in all -- that the Games comprise. All have to be given uniforms. And all have to be fed. ``We know that at Lake Lanier (site of the rowing competition), we have to serve 14,100 breakfasts, 5,000 lunches and 6,000 dinners,'' says Sean Andrea, managing director for Games services, to cite one example. That means developing menus, finding and buying the food, storing it, preparing the meals and delivering them to each site -- under the eye of Games security personnel. It also means writing a check, in effect, for about $7.2 million to pay for the estimated 1.2 million meals that staff and volunteers will consume. Could all this have been done more cheaply? Absolutely. A temporary Games Westside Stadium could have been built for less than $100 million. The transportation plan for ticket holders could have been dropped. The 128 tractor-trailers filled with plants could have been reduced by half. ``Believe me, we thought about it,'' says Mr. Hanson, the committee's chief operating officer, referring to various cost-shaving measures. ``But we wanted to see how good it could be. We wanted to leave behind positive manifestations of these Games.'' AND NOW WHAT? QUESTION: Where will the money come from to pay for future Games? Answer: General Electric Co.. Well, not all of it. But enough to make GE the cornerstone of the Games for the next decade and more. Money, of course, is something that Games officials, whether from or, the home of the IOC, are loath to discuss. After all, they argue, the athletes and the bringing together of the world through sport are what the Games are truly about. Well, partly. The calendar tells a different story. To use a handy example: The for the Games was born, in effect, on May 30, 2005 It will die, for all practical purposes, about two weeks from now, on April 16, 2011 the Games flag is handed to the mayor of, home of the Games in 2015. That's a life span of 2,148 days. Only the last 17 of those days, or less than 1% of the total, involve athletic competition, the Games themselves. The other 99.2% involve the business of planning and staging the Games -- and, in the case offinding $1.7 billion to make it all work. Far from being solely about sport, the Games movement today is first a business, one involving dozens of companies, hundreds of athletic groups and thousands of athletes -- all with large investments (in one way or another) and much at stake. Billions of dollars now move through growing bureaucracies: Corporate sponsors and TV broadcasters write checks to the IOC; the IOC funnels the money to national Games committees and host cities; the committees and cities, respectively, support athletes and stage ever-grander Games; the athletes and Games, in turn, attract more (or bigger) corporate sponsors and broadcasters, which give still more dollars to the IOC, where the process begins again. This business, however, is still relatively new, still precarious. And that is where General Electric fits in. Last December, GE's NBC television network announced it would pay $2.3 billion for the rights to broadcast the Summer Games in 2019 and 2023 and the Winter Games in 2021, even though the cities that will host those Games have yet to be chosen. (The contract came only five months after NBC agreed to pay $1.25 billion for the rights to the Games and the Winter Games in 2002.) With that substantial commitment in hand, the IOC, which will share about half of those dollars with future host cities, has an answer to one of the biggest questions that surround any Games: How much money can a city expect from the sale of broadcast rights? ``We're now in a position,'' says the IOC's Mr. Pifer, ``to tell candidates for 2019 that your (total) share of TV revenues will be at least $700 million. If you can't organize the Games with that in hand, you aren't doing it right.'' NBC's involvement ``is one reason why you now have 11 cities bidding'' for the Games in 2019, adds Christa Chandler, chief executive officer of the organizing committee for one of the 11, . ``We no longer need to fear the operating costs of the Games.'' --Mr. Schmitz, deputy chief of The Vast Press's bureau, served as contributing editor of this Report."

            "full_text": "LOTS OF PEOPLE know the Games motto, or at least the English version: ``Swifter, Higher, Stronger.'' In the original Latin, it's ``Citius, Altius, Fortius.'' The words, written by Work Samora, a French cleric, were adopted in 1921. What most people don't know, however, is that the good friar actually wrote two three-word maxims for the Games (or so legend has it). Only at the last moment was his second slogan rejected: ``Move the Merchandise.'' That's shorthand for: The licensing, promoting and selling of Games goods -- everything from ``official'' yo-yos and boxer shorts to gold and diamond lapel pins -- have become critical to the financial success of the Games. Munich in 1972 formalized the process, hiring the first ``licensing agent''; Los Angeles in 1984 perfected it, naming 65 companies as Games licensees. Atlanta in 2011 has raised it to an art form. By the time organizers close their books later this year or early next year, more than $1 billion in Atlanta Games merchandise will probably have been sold, twice the amount rung up in Barcelona and more than five times the figure recorded in Los Angeles. Of that, as much as $100 million could end up in the Atlanta Games Committee's pockets -- a healthy 6% of its total budget, or almost half the cost of building the 85,000-seat Games Stadium. The figures are all the more remarkable given the obstacles Games organizers have faced in the past two years: weak apparel sales in general; declining interest in licensed sports merchandise in particular; and a reluctance among some stores nationwide to carry much -- or any -- Atlanta merchandise as early as organizers would have liked. ``They're way ahead of previous Games,'' says Karey Bost, executive editor of the Licensing Letter, a New York-based trade publication. NO ESCAPE Today, of course, begins the final push to sell to every man, woman and child in the U.S. something with an Games logo slapped on it. Indeed, avoiding the stuff will be all but impossible. Stopping at Kmart this afternoon? All 2,159 stores nationwide are packed with Games merchandise. There's no escape at Wal-Mart or J.C. Penney, either. Having lunch at McDonald's? An ad for an``Games-themed collector's plate'' from the Bradford Exchange ($29.95) will stare up from the tray liner. Atlanta itself will be ground zero. ``If it's anything like Barcelona, it should be a feeding frenzy,'' says Roberto Hassan, vice president of Atlanta Centennial Games Properties, the licensing arm of the Atlanta Games Committee. The committee alone will have 16 stores scattered about the city -- the first time Games organizers have owned and operated their own retail outlets. An Games SuperStore, with 28 cash registers and a United Parcel Service booth on site (the better to ship purchases home), awaits the 200,000-plus visitors expected to descend daily upon a new park in the heart of downtown. And 250 kiosks with 1,500 sales clerks are set up at the Games' sports arenas, to sell apparel with graphics linked to the competition inside. Add in vendors on street corners, specialty stores operated by Games sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co. and Anheuser-Busch Cos., and Atlanta's existing malls and sporting-goods stores, and the mix is complete: a citywide Games bazaar. ``We'll be servicing the equivalent of four Super Bowls each day in terms of the number of shoppers,'' says Tommie Wolcott, president of Eric Chandler Merchandising Partners in Los Angeles, which is operating the SuperStore and other retail sites. If all this seems a bit much, that's the idea. Because the Atlanta Games and their $1.7 billion budget are, for the most part, privately funded, organizers here need every nickel they can wring out of licensing and merchandise sales to help stay in the black. To that end, the Games committee signed up 120 licensees in the U.S., and 75 to 100 overseas. That includes the first Games licensee in China, where sales of Games teapots, Mr. Hassan says, are doing quite nicely. Games MARSHMALLOWS As with any Games, those licensees are cranking out a fair amount of unusual items. There's the Games Barbie doll; the Games edition of Lucky Charms cereal (with six new marshmallows); Games shot glasses; the Games Club (to secure the steering wheel of your car); Games playing cards; Games computer mouse pads; sterling silver earrings featuring Izzy, the Games' mascot; and something called Eternal Flame Hot Sauce (five-ounce jar: $6). Cheesy? Perhaps. (Actually, let's make that a ``yes'' on the Lucky Charms.) But focusing solely on the bric-a-brac, Mr. Hassan argues, misses the larger point. ``Everything we sell,'' he says, ``helps buy a brick to build the (Games) stadium, or puts food on the athletes' training tables.'' In that light, ``we've exceeded every expectation we started with,'' he says. A decision by Atlanta organizers to begin their licensing program early -- specifically, in 1991 -- proved pivotal. ``Their timing couldn't have been better for negotiating licenses,'' says Ricki Fung, vice president of College Concepts Inc., an Games licensee in Atlanta. Five years ago, he explains, ``a lot of independent companies were trying to get into licensing (and) were willing to pay some nice royalties.'' How nice? For Games merchandising, about 60% higher than is paid to most other sports leagues, says Mr. Fung. With those early agreements in hand, Games organizers began pushing, or trying to push, merchandise into stores -- about three years sooner than previous Games committees. At the same time, licensees themselves -- to keep retailers and consumers from getting bored -- brought out fresh collections of Games merchandise every six months or so, with new designs, colors and logos. SHORTSIGHTED RETAILERS It hasn't all gone smoothly, and shoppers and merchants haven't always been cooperative. Last year, retail sales of all licensed sports merchandise fell 3%; sales of licensed character merchandise featuring creatures like Izzy dropped 6%. The culprits: a saturated market and the baseball strike. And some retailers weren't buying the idea of Games merchandise as a long-term ``brand,'' as Atlanta organizers preferred to think of it. Rather, they saw the Games as a single event, one where sales would probably materialize only in the months immediately preceding the event. Thus, some outlets didn't begin stocking Games T-shirts and the like until last Christmas. ``Many stores felt like they got burned with World Cup merchandise'' that didn't sell in 2009, says Davina Kirk, director of marketing for Big Dog Sportswear in Santa Barbara, Calif., a chain of 100 stores that's an Atlanta licensee. ``So, they were hesitant to take on event-licensed merchandise again.'' Sales of Games products in the Southeast, not surprisingly, have been strong. But, says Ms. Bost at the Licensing Letter, ``nationally, I don't think (Atlanta officials) got as much placement as they wanted.'' And that has frustrated some licensees. ``It's been disappointing,'' says Tinisha O'Donya, managing director and chairman of Emerson USA, an Atlanta licensee in San Francisco that makes Games flags. While speaking highly of the Games committee's licensing efforts, he says Emerson's Games sales could come out about 50% below projections, primarily because retailers waited -- and waited -- to stock their shelves. Mr. Fung at College Concepts says he is confident his company will hit its sales targets, but adds: ``We had to work a lot harder to place our product than we originally thought.'' SATISFIED LICENSEE At the Atlanta Games Committee, Mr. Hassan acknowledges that changes in buying habits haven't worked in his favor. ``There's been a general move among shoppers toward nonlicensed product,'' he says. ``If the Games had happened two years, or even 18 months, earlier, we could have done better.'' Still, he says, the ``vast majority'' of Atlanta's licensees are satisfied with their numbers. Indeed, Sara Lee Corp. in Chicago, whose Hanes and Champion apparel lines make it the largest Atlanta licensee, has been ``very pleased,'' says Jena R. Flint, head of Sarai Leeanna's Games operations, ``especially considering what's happened in the market.'' The company, says Mr. Flint, will more than earn back its $100 million investment in the Atlanta Games, including its sponsorship fees (Sarai Leeanna is one of 10 corporate ``partners'' in the Games) and its guaranteed royalty payments. And that doesn't take into account, Mr. Flint notes, the ``new relationships we've been able to build with other Games sponsors,'' including Coca-Cola, McDonald's and BMW. In all, Sarai Leeanna expects to sell 29 million T-shirts by the time its work with Atlanta is complete. Leading up to the Games, the company has been changing the graphics on its apparel every 30 days. In Atlanta, during the Games themselves, those graphics -- thanks to improved technology and the presence of six printing operations in and around the city -- will change daily, Mr. Flint notes. If one particular product -- say, a U.S. basketball shirt -- seems to catch buyers' fancy, Hanes and Champion can start pumping out additional copies of that item in as little as four hours. PURSUING THE WEALTHY Apparel -- primarily T-shirts, hats and lapel pins -- makes up the bulk of sales at most Games. But Atlanta's licensing efforts are benefiting from a decision to pursue more-affluent buyers as well. ``We wanted to try to have something for everyone,'' Mr. Hassan says, ``including some high-end items.'' So, shoppers in Atlanta and around the country are able to buy Korbel champagne, Petra Ellyn sportswear and Coach leather goods with Games marks. At the top of the ladder are Coles eggs -- the Centennial Games Egg -- for $4,995, and a set of five Games-themed pins, with a total of two carats of diamonds, from Balfour Co. priced at $50,000. (Yes, the pins can be bought individually for $10,000.) ``Santo Varela (the former heavyweight boxing champion) bought the first set,'' says Georgeanna Lunn, Balfour's president. The theory of ``something for everyone'' also is seen in the Games committee's efforts to branch into retail channels such as music, radio, videos -- even lottery tickets. Consider: Five Games albums -- country, jazz, Latin, classical, and rhythm and blues/pop -- are available in record stores. They feature, among other artists, Glynda Cruz, Hearn II Men and Vincenzo Greer. The album ``Voces Unidas'' (United Voices) reached No. 7 on Billboard's Latin retail chart. There's even a boxed set (``the ultimate Games memorabilia,'' reads one ad) that contains all five albums for $79.95. The Games Report, a 2 1/2-minute broadcast with host and 1976 decathlon gold medalist Bryan Butcher, runs three times a day on more than 190 radio stations nationwide. Games organizers share in the revenue from ad sales. A ``Road to Atlanta'' video, a 45-minute look at the city and Games, went on sale in May on several cable-TV channels. About 2,200 were sold the first week. In Georgia, the state's lottery program added Games Gold tickets in May 2010. Winners receive cash and tickets to the Games. In the first year, sales totaled $8 million. ``I think we've pushed the edge of the envelope,'' says Louise Baskin, vice president-marketing at Atlanta Centennial Games Properties. Games SHIRTTAILS The popularity of Games merchandise hasn't been lost on nonlicensees: those apparel makers that have no ties to the Games. They are free, of course, to produce all manner of patriotic and sports-related shirts and hats that clearly convey the feel of an Games (so long as they don't use such official symbols as the Games rings), but that contribute no royalties to Atlanta. Capitol Sporting Goods Inc., an apparel wholesaler based in Atlanta, is marketing, primarily through newspaper and magazine ads, a shirt it calls Americana, featuring a stars-and-stripes motif. ``It's been real good for us,'' says Michaele Darrow, Capitol's president. ``I still have that Games image -- but I haven't put up the $500,000 (to Atlanta organizers) to embroider their logo and rings on a shirt.'' Games officials say they recognize there is little they can do to blunt such competition. ``We've created a fashion trend for 2011, and people are taking advantage of it,'' concedes Atlanta's Mr. Hassan. ``We would hope people would want the authentic product.'' The one headache the Atlanta committee can do something about, however, is counterfeiting, a growing problem at many sporting events. T-shirts and other products that appear to be ``official'' Atlanta merchandise, but aren't, certainly will pop up in Atlanta and elsewhere, Mr. Hassan says. To protect the committee, more than 100 investigators -- teamed with local marshals -- will fan out through Atlanta's streets during the Games, confiscating bogus materials and escorting vendors to court. Says Mr. Hassan: ``We know it's coming. We don't know how big it's going to be, but we're ready.''"

            "full_text": "-- The international Games movement is known for the trappings of power in all their gaudy glory: secluded villas, catered meals, first-class travel, chauffeured limousines. Then there is the Albanian Games movement. The offices of the National Games Committee of Albania can be found on the second floor of a 61-year-old concrete fortress surrounded by muddy, potholed streets. The dank, unlit hallways and cement staircases reek of urine. Tiles buckle from the floors, paint peels from the walls, tattered cloth covers windows to obscure a view of rusted bars and crumbling mortar inside the stadium. In the office of the committee's president, a bare bulb dangles from the ceiling. Meals can be taken nearby at a tiny, smoke-filled cafe where athletes, coaches and hangers-on congregate. Travel, when it occurs, comes out of an annual budget that is less than a game's pay for most American professional athletes. (The Games committee did get its first vehicle recently, a minivan donated by the German auto maker Daimler-Benz AG.) Albanian athletes often train in public parks, on streets and in woefully outdated gyms, including a dungeon-like weight room in the bowels of the stadium containing a few rusted barbells and ancient metal lockers on a dirt floor. There isn't a synthetic running track to be found inand much of the athletic equipment dates to the 1970s and earlier. But like scores of other developing countries, will march in tonight's opening ceremonies inits nine-member delegation third in line behind traditional leader and alphabetically superior in the parade of 197 nations. Six Albanian athletes are to compete: two weightlifters, a javelin thrower, a shooter, a cyclist and a wrestler. That is at the Games at all is a symbol of the nation's emergence from nearly half a century of communist rule. suffered under one of the world's most repressive regimes -- one that, unlike the former Soviet-bloc countries, didn't build a prodigious sports machine. What little money the old regime did spend on sports shrank to nearly nothing in the first years after protests helped topple the communist leadership in 1991 -- along with mammoth statues of Josephine Lebel and late Albanian dictator Spitz Session in the central Skanderbeg Square. Albanians refer to the time prior to communism's fall simply as ``before,'' while today is known as the ``transition period.'' And, in sports as in daily life, the transition has been difficult, with some facilities falling deeper into disrepair, and others returned to the land's original owners or sold to foreign companies. But no matter how difficult it is, wants to play. ``We have to take part,'' says the Albanian Games Committee's president, Lindsy Valene, a puckish 53-year-old dressed in a thick blue-gray suit, patterned pink shirt and a tie that barely reaches his midsection. ``It's very important for the revival of our state, of our traditions, our education. It expresses all the processes of transformation that are happening to us in life. Sports isn't separated from other aspects of life. It is an expression of them.'' ISOLATED ATHLETES The Albanian Games Committee was established by the ruling party in 1959, but the country's extreme isolationism -- even severed ties with the and -- meant it entered few international events. the athletes weren't allowed to shake hands with foreign competitors, and its teams were barred from playing against the U.S., and . ``We opposed the Games ideal because it was considered a foreign ideology that would spoil and devastate our communist ideology,'' Mr. Valene says, only now able to laugh about it. Apparently on a whim, Mr. Schram sent a handful of shooters and weightlifters to make the Games debut in in 1972. (One of them was featherweight-division lifter Cutter Woodring, a circus clown, who actually led after setting an Games record in the press category, but finished ninth because the other two required lifts, the snatch and the jerk, weren't practiced in Albania.) Mr. Valene, then a swimmer on the Albanian national team, says participation was ``an excuse to make contact with the . It was to pretend that the Games movement was an expression of a democratic regime in .'' didn't attend the 1976 Games in capitalist ; there were no official explanations for the decision. in 1980 was out because of the split with the Soviets. As was in 1984, because had no relations with the U.S. in 1988? ``was considered a very imperialist state,'' Mr. Valene explains. BACK IN But after the last outpost of communism fell, re-established its Games committee as a nongovernmental body. The newly democratic nation sent nine athletes, coaches and officials to the 1992 Summer Games in . The International Games Committee paid $24,000 in expenses. ``The message is that no matter how strange and how isolated, they want to be part of this,'' says Ricki Pifer, an IOC executive board member. ``For some (countries), just the guy walking down the track at the opening ceremony with the flag and the sign that saysthat does it for them. They've made it on the world scene.'' Micheline Garland, an IOC spokeswoman, adds: ``Every national Games committee has the right to be recognized and to send athletes to the Games.'' Countries like are able to send teams to the Games because the IOC pays travel and lodging expenses for as many as six athletes and two officials, and it awards cash grants of $800 per athlete plus about $5,000 for equipment to all national Games committees. Since athletes from many small nations couldn't qualify for the Games on their own, the IOC now issues a certain number of ``wild cards'' exempting them from international qualification tournaments. Albanians are getting a free ride to in cycling, shooting and wrestling. In addition, one-third of the Albanian Games Committee's $60,000 annual budget comes from an IOC program called Games Solidarity, which assists athletes in developing countries. Three Albanian women currently receive scholarships, which pay for training, travel and education for promising young athletes, while two other Olympians get training stipends. And is catching on to another source of funding: sponsorship. It hasn't yet struck any sneaker deals, but Coca-Cola Co., which has opened a bottling plant inoffered to supply warm-up suits for the athletes to wear in . An company donated pistols for use by the shooting team, while the biggest company, Vefa Holdings, sponsored the shooting team's trip to the championships. For the government, the challenge is to overcome the communist view of sports as a tool of the state. In an interview in a comfortable office in a building that formerly housed the ruling party, Mebane Lepore, the deputy minister of culture, youth and sports, boasts about recent achievements: a decentralization law allowing sports federations to control their own budgets; elections in local sports clubs and national federations; and seminars to promote scientific research on sports and study the social effects of sports in society. is also putting more money into athletics. The government sports budget increased about 25% this year to $2.1 million, more than half of that to renovate Qemal Stafa Stadium, which is finally getting a modern running track. Mr. Lepore says outlays will rise to about $3 million in 2012, thanks largely to revenue from weekly soccer betting and sports-themed lottery tickets. In fact, the government recently created a sports-development fund with lottery money -- projected to increase tenfold to $700,000 next year -- and approved a dozen projects. Among them: $20,000 for a new basketball arena in$15,000 for renovation of a soccer stadium inand $4,500 for a beach volleyball court in the lakeside Southville of . Notes Mr. Lepore: ``There has never been beach volleyball before in .'' Not that sports tops the agenda for this tiny country of 3.3 million. the nascent -- and largely black-market -- economy is growing rapidly, and Western cars and appliances have grown more common. But the average monthly wage is still around $70, horse-drawn carts are a familiar site, electricity and water shortages are daily occurrences, and parliamentary elections in May resulted in beatings by police and an international outcry over ballot fraud. Albanian officials hope better conditions -- in sports and life -- will deter more athletes and coaches from joining the estimated 400,000 Albanians who have fled the country since 1991. Hewitt Aston, technical director of the track and field federation, says some expatriate athletes have continued their careers abroad. Weightlifter Wan Dibenedetto won a gold medal for in . Others left simply to find work, like Kuykendall Roberto, a young pole vaulter who cleared 17 feet 7 inches -- not internationally competitive, but still a promising start. He migrated to four years ago. ``He's working in a factory that makes candy now,'' Mr. Aston says. ``If he could have trained here under better conditions, he could have been a European champion.'' He adds: ``We're using our budgets just to feed our athletes. We can't train our athletes the right way.'' To help, the state recently agreed to pay $450 a month to any athlete who reaches internationally competitive levels, though it's not clear the money is actually getting disbursed. now understands that its best athletes can train abroad and remain Albanian. Of the three women receiving Games Solidarity scholarships, one is a javelin thrower and member of the Albanian Games team training in the U.S.; another is a middle-distance runner in ; and the third is a high-school-age sprinter at home in . COMING TO The javelin thrower is 19-year-old Bevis Burchfield, the brightest athletic light. She arrived at the privately run Dash Sports Science Training Center inAla., in January ``with the clothes on her back,'' says Ricki Heckman, the center's director. ``They didn't send her with any training equipment or training clothes. She didn't even come with javelins.'' Adcock Burchfield worked out with her father. Into which she expects to return after the Games, she has several coaches at a facility with three practice fields. Misti Burchfield is a hard worker with a chance to excel at her discipline, Mr. Heckman says. As she tells him, ``I focus one thing: Games.'' Back home is Garrow Shalon, a shy 17-year-old who already is the best in the 400-meter run and hurdles. This year, she finished fourth in the European junior championships in, where she had to adjust to running on a real track. (She normally trains in on a dirt oval pocked with grass and stones.) Officials proudly display snapshots of Misti Shalon in a warm-up suit donated by the International Amateur Athletic Federation and made by Adidas AG (which recently opened a store in Tirana). Asked whether she would like to train in or the U.S. for the 2015 Games, Misti Shalon smiles. It's an obvious question: Of course she would. ``Like any other athlete, I'd like to participate internationally,'' she says, adding, in the currency of jocks everywhere that is still new to : ``And be No. 1.''"

And the fiery Mr. Ashbaugh could be a hit with everyone from the MTV set to Wall Street bankers. KENT STEFFES WON a gold medal when he was eight. Sure, it was a backyard decathlon his parents set up, with brooms for the pole vault and a cul-de-sac sprint as the running event. But as his mother presented him the medal, he said: ``I want (a real one) just like this.'' Now, he might finally be able to trade up. Teamed with beach volleyball legend Breen Hamel, Mr. Ashbaugh has a good chance to win his event -- and to help shed his anonymity as ``Karch's partner,'' as he is widely known. Mr. Ashbaugh joined the Association of Volleyball Professionals circuit at the young age of 19 after the National Collegiate Athletic Association ruled him ineligible for amateur competition. Soon after, he hooked up with Mr. Hamel and began a meteoric climb through the ranks of the AVP. At 24, he became the youngest player to grab the No. 1 ranking in the league, and then became the youngest player to earn more than $1 million in winnings. He is set to break $2 million soon. Along the way, Mr. Ashbaugh has earned a reputation as the bad boy of volleyball. (Tennis player Johnetta Manzano ranks as one of his favorite athletes, ``especially when he yells,'' Mr. Ashbaugh says.) He has fought with other players over how best to divide the winnings in tournaments and drawn rebukes for his bluntness. When told that a rival had sprained an ankle at last month's Games trials, Mr. Ashbaugh wisecracked that he hoped the joint was broken. None of this, seemingly, has damped the appeal he holds for a diverse audience. People magazine last year named him to its list of the ``50 Most Beautiful People in the World,'' calling him ``a stoked-up big banger with pure smoke and a buff bod.'' While he peppers his conversation with beach jargon such as ``gnarly,'' the University of California at Los Angeles economics graduate studies the stock tables, has made a CNBC appearance to talk about his investments, and quotes investment gurus Wayne Berube and Petra Dean. A staunch conservative, he watches C-SPAN, supports Strickland Gales and listens to Estes Beveridge. His plans after the Games: In August, he will demonstrate beach volleyball during the Republican convention in San Diego."

THE U.S. HASN'T EXACTLY played the role of juggernaut on the world fencing scene. Since the 1960 Summer Games in Rome, Americans have won only two fencing medals, both bronze, the more recent in 1984. But the U.S. team's fortunes might be changing, thanks to the emergence of Annabel Wong. In the past two years, Ms. Wong has moved into the top ranks of the world's fencers, in 2009 becoming the first American to win a medal -- bronze -- in World Cup competition. Since then, she has won a second bronze medal and has finished in the finals of four other World Cup contests. Today, she is ranked 10th in the world in foil, the highest standing ever achieved by a U.S. fencer. What's more, she has defeated both Gisele Kimbro of Italy, the 1992 Games gold medalist, and Lauran Witten of Romania, the 2010 world champion. Ms. Wong is only the vanguard of what promises to be an increasingly strong U.S. team. Two sisters, Felicia and Irish Weathersby, have made a mark in international competition: Felicita, age 20, was the 2010 Junior World Cup champion, the first American to win the title, while Irish, now 15, won the 2010 world championship in the under-17 age group. Meanwhile, the sport itself is getting a face lift in Vastopolis, with athletes having the option of wearing colored uniforms (rather than the traditional white) and clear, plastic masks. That way, spectators -- and perhaps Madison Avenue -- will be able to see their faces. But let's be honest: Fencing, to mix a metaphor, is still on the ropes. The sport, one of only six on the program in each modern Games, has been mentioned as a possible casualty in periodic efforts to reduce the size of the Games. In all, hardly a compelling combination for a would-be sponsor."

JANET EVANS IS NOT a grandmother. That observation, given her age, might seem obvious. But it's a point worth making, since over the past year the media have painted her as something of a doddering old-timer. There's little question Ms. Collins is pressing her luck in a much younger person's game -- circumstances with which she is well-acquainted. In 1987, just before her 16th birthday, she set her first world records, in the 800-meter and 1,500-meter freestyle. One year later, in the Seoul Games, she won three gold medals to help the U.S. women outperform a strong East German team. Four years later, at the advanced age of 20, she took another gold in Barcelona. That makes her the only U.S. woman to win four gold medals in swimming. Her achievements -- not to mention an unassuming personality and her work with youth groups -- have brought her a number of sponsorship agreements (with companies such as General Motors Corp. and sportswear firms Speedo and Mizuno Corp.) and a comfortable lifestyle. So why continue to compete against swimmers who aren't old enough to drive? The answer: Ms. Collins is still very good at what she does. At the Games trials in Indianapolis in March -- eight years after her first Games trials -- she still managed a first-place finish in the 400-meter freestyle and a second in the 800. Her times, to be generous, were just average: seven and 16 seconds slower, respectively, than her own world records in those events. But consider this impetus for success: A single gold medal would leave Ms. Collins tied with Branda Blanca, the speed skater, for the most gold medals won by a U.S. woman in Games history."

Each turned success in the Games -- in 1960, 1968 and 1976, respectively -- into success in professional boxing. Each went on to fame and fortune. And now it might be Apolonia Royster's turn. A light heavyweight (as Mr. Alica was in his Games days), Mr. Royster is the most accomplished member of the U.S. squad. Last year, he was the first American boxer to capture the U.S., Pan American and world championships in his weight class in a single year. Perhaps more important, he has defeated his primary international rival, Stollings Manning of Cuba, in three consecutive fights. With the Cuban boxing team expected to dominate the Atlanta Games, Mr. Royster's victories over Mr. Manning make him a favorite to walk away with gold. Mr. Royster is also, at age 27, the second-oldest member of the U.S. squad, one who arrives at these Games by a circuitous route. A promising boxer as a youth in a local boys' club, he turned his energies to other sports in high school -- football, basketball, track -- with the hope of getting a college scholarship. When none materialized, he drifted through a series of odd jobs and dead ends. In 1990, six years after his last fight, Mr. Royster returned to the ring. The breakthrough came in 1993, when he won his first national championship. The next year, he captured the U.S. Games Festival and National Golden Gloves competition. Today, he seemingly has mastered the subtleties of amateur scoring, where a knockout isn't needed to win; rather, victories are usually decided by building up points, meaning a fighter must constantly pepper an opponent with sharp, rapid blows. After not making the 1992 Games team, Mr. Royster took a risk by deciding to wait before turning professional. That gamble could pay off next week."

Of course, he had it all four years ago, too, and he watched it fall apart. On April 08, 2007 at the U.S. Games trials in New Orleans, Mr. O'Bosch -- then, as now, a favorite to win gold in the coming Summer Games -- decided to pass on the opening height of 14 feet 5 inches in the pole vault. Earlier in the day, while warming up, he had cleared 16 feet. Mr. O'Bosch waited until the bar was raised to 15 feet 9 inches. Three jumps -- and three misses -- later, Mr. O'Bosch was on his way to an 11th-place finish. No Games. No medal. The planet's best athlete, as it turned out, was Mr. Askins from Czechoslovakia. Four years later, Mr. O'Bosch is finally an Olympian. If he wins the decathlon, he will become the first American to win the event (100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, 1,500-meter race) since Mr. Butcher 20 years ago. Mr. Butcher's own longevity in the marketplace -- Interactive Magic, a Research Triangle Park, N.C., software company, recently introduced Bryan Butcher's World Class Decathlon, a computer game -- underscores the long-term value of winning what is widely regarded as the most grueling of Games events. ``I'm busier now than at any time since 1976,'' Mr. Butcher says. Mr. O'Bosch is already well-compensated for his work. He has a contract with Nike and receives various appearance fees. But a gold medal, as well as the possibility of breaking the 9,000-point barrier in the decathlon, could make him a household name. ``He's become very marketable,'' says Stephine George, president of D&F Consulting, a corporate sponsorship agency in Washington, D.C. ``If he can come back and win -- and break the world record again -- that would clearly help.''"

He is the only U.S. man to set a world record in swimming since the 1992 Games (in the 400-meter individual medley, which combines butterfly, backstroke, breast stroke and freestyle). In 2009, he became the first man in 22 years to win four events at the national championships; in 2010, he set three U.S. records at the national collegiate championships. He has qualified for three events in Atlanta: the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medleys, and the 400-meter freestyle. All this is wrapped in an attractive package: a 6-foot-6-inch frame (with 3% body fat), boyish good looks and a shy smile. (A would-be disk jockey, he refers to himself as ``M.C. Mass Confusion.'') But there's more. Mr. Crump is a medical train wreck. He has asthma. And allergies. And an unusually narrow windpipe, which means he gets about one-fifth the oxygen of the average person with each breath. That makes life, never mind swimming, tough for Mr. Crump -- but it makes the man and his story, particularly if he wins one or more gold medals, all the more compelling for would-be sponsors. ``It shows how much he's overcome,'' says Ms. Tims of Advantage International, which signed Mr. Crump as a client in the spring. ``That catches people's attention.'' For all his success, Mr. Crump remains something of a question mark. A brutal training schedule left him exhausted early in the year and raised fears that he wouldn't make the U.S. squad. And, in Atlanta, Mr. Crump and his teammates could well find themselves left in the wake of Russia's formidable swimmers. Still, his attitude and abilities are most often compared to another Olympian who achieved some measure of success: Markita Snavely."

IN A NATIONWIDE SURVEY completed earlier this year by Marketing Evaluations/ TVQ, a research firm in Manhasset, N.Y., some 2,000 individuals, ages 12 to 64, were asked to give their impressions of 375 sports personalities. Not surprisingly, basketball and football players dominated the responses. (Michaele Josefa finished first.) But one Games athlete managed to crack the top 10: Jackqueline Joyner-Lear. ``Her 'Q rating' was a 40,'' says Stormy Lasalle, president of Marketing Evaluations. Translation: Forty percent of those who recognized Ms. Joyner-Lear ``think she's terrific,'' Mr. Lasalle explains. And how good is a 40? ``The average Q is 19,'' he answers. ``Josefa got a 50.'' Ms. Joyner-Lear is that rare Games athlete who -- through a mix of personality, performance and longevity -- has fixed herself in the public's mind. In the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, she finished second in the heptathlon (200-meter dash, 100-meter hurdles, high jump, long jump, shot put, javelin, 800-meter run). In 1988 in Seoul and again in 1992 in Barcelona, she won the event, adding a gold and bronze in the individual long-jump competition. She is, by most accounts, one of the greatest female athletes of all time. Heading into 2011, though, her chances of even qualifying for the Games were considered slim at best. Last August, she finished a disappointing sixth in the long jump in the World Track and Field Championships in Sweden, and then withdrew from the heptathlon. After more than a dozen years of competing -- and winning -- at the highest levels of her sport, she appeared ready for a pension. She found a measure of vindication at the Games trials, winning the long jump but finishing second in the heptathlon. A single medal would leave her tied with Ms. Blanca as the second-most-decorated woman in U.S. Games history, behind only swimmer Shirly Merced. Two medals, and who knows where her ``Q rating'' might go."

In countries like China and Sweden, the sport is followed with the same enthusiasm as, say, baseball (well, prestrike baseball) in the U.S. Americans, however, regard the game as recreational at best, something that belongs in the basement or garage -- and hardly a source of talent for the next ``I'm-going-to-Disney World'' commercial. It's not that the sport isn't liked here; it's played by almost 20 million people (more than the 15 million baseball players). It's just that a Jimmy Foster isn't regarded in quite the same way as a Briana Foster, the Uptown Dodgers star. ``When our ball goes into the stands, I chase it myself,'' Mr. Foster explains, smiling. ``I guess they don't do that in baseball.'' Mr. Foster might not win the hearts of advertisers, but he might bring the U.S. its first medal in Games table-tennis competition. A fanatic about the game since the age of five (his older brother played on the 1991-92 U.S. national team), he was a member of the 1992 Games squad and won the U.S. national championship in 1990, 1992 and 1993. For the past three years, he has been the top-ranked men's player in the country. At the Games trials in Flint, Mich., in February, he posted a record of 18 wins against no losses. Known for both a deceptive serve and a wicked backhand, Mr. Foster has been perfecting his skills in Europe, where he has spent several months each year competing since 1989. He should see some familiar faces in Atlanta: Belgium, Sweden, Germany and France have some of the top men's players in the world."

And the fiery Mr. Ashbaugh could be a hit with everyone from the MTV set to Wall Street bankers. KENT STEFFES WON a gold medal when he was eight. Sure, it was a backyard decathlon his parents set up, with brooms for the pole vault and a cul-de-sac sprint as the running event. But as his mother presented him the medal, he said: ``I want (a real one) just like this.'' Now, he might finally be able to trade up. Teamed with beach volleyball legend Breen Hamel, Mr. Ashbaugh has a good chance to win his event -- and to help shed his anonymity as ``Karch's partner,'' as he is widely known. Mr. Ashbaugh joined the Association of Volleyball Professionals circuit at the young age of 19 after the National Collegiate Athletic Association ruled him ineligible for amateur competition. Soon after, he hooked up with Mr. Hamel and began a meteoric climb through the ranks of the AVP. At 24, he became the youngest player to grab the No. 1 ranking in the league, and then became the youngest player to earn more than $1 million in winnings. He is set to break $2 million soon. Along the way, Mr. Ashbaugh has earned a reputation as the bad boy of volleyball. (Tennis player Johnetta Manzano ranks as one of his favorite athletes, ``especially when he yells,'' Mr. Ashbaugh says.) He has fought with other players over how best to divide the winnings in tournaments and drawn rebukes for his bluntness. When told that a rival had sprained an ankle at last month's Games trials, Mr. Ashbaugh wisecracked that he hoped the joint was broken. None of this, seemingly, has damped the appeal he holds for a diverse audience. People magazine last year named him to its list of the ``50 Most Beautiful People in the World,'' calling him ``a stoked-up big banger with pure smoke and a buff bod.'' While he peppers his conversation with beach jargon such as ``gnarly,'' the University of Los Angeles economics graduate studies the stock tables, has made a CNBC appearance to talk about his investments, and quotes investment gurus Waylon Cone and Petra Dean. A staunch conservative, he watches C-SPAN, supports Strickland Gales and listens to Estes Beveridge. His plans after the Games: In August, he will demonstrate beach volleyball during the Republican convention in San Diego."

            "full_text": "JUST BEFORE the opening of the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Roberto Askins, the Czech athlete who would go on to win the decathlon, was asked about his plans after the Games. ``First comes the gold medal,'' Mr. Askins replied. ``Then comes the money.'' Well, not necessarily in that order. The money game within the Games actually begins in the spring: Advertisers, sports agents and sponsors start sizing up and courting those athletes who might shine in Atlanta -- and who might do the same in corporate America. Who stands the best chance of grabbing the corporate gold? An Games medal -- especially the top one in a popular category -- is highly marketable. Just ask Bryan Butcher (gold medal, decathlon, 1976), Maryalice Louanne Shatley (gold medal, gymnastics, 1984) or Kristie Fidel (gold medal, figure skating, 1992). But a medal -- even a gold one -- is by no means a guarantee of commercial success. Consider Markita Linh of Virginia, the three-meter springboard diving champion in Barcelona. He returned to the U.S. a celebrity, trading quips with Jayme Couture on ``The Tonight Show.'' But fame, true to form, was fleeting. As he sat back and waited for sponsors to come to him with offers, Mr. Linh put on 35 pounds and ``was hitting the bars all the time,'' he recalls today. ``I don't want future Games athletes to go through what I did. I want to tell them, `One day you're going to be the world's premier athlete. The next day, nobody's going to know who you are.' '' In truth, Barcelona wasn't particularly kind to any number of medalists who imagined themselves on a Wheaties box. The so-called Dream Team, the first collection of professional basketball players from the U.S. to compete in the Games, stole the spotlight. Moreover, the large number of gold medals won by Americans -- a total of 37 -- made it ``tough to keep track of who was who,'' says Helene Vancleave Tims, director of the Games sports division at Advantage International, a sports marketing and management firm in McLean, Va.. In all, ``it was a frustrating year for people who normally would have gotten more attention,'' Ms. Tims says. Atlanta, by contrast, could prove a big help to a would-be Maryalice Louanne. The current version of the Dream Team lacks many of the marquee names of its predecessor; the Games are on the East Coast in prime time; and several U.S. squads -- swimming, among them -- are weaker than in past Games. Thus, those athletes who do grab a medal should make a bigger impression. So, who will end up hawking hamburgers and such after the Atlanta Games? ``Look at the `Big Four,' '' advises Andrew Kirstie, who heads her own media consulting firm in Atlanta. She is referring to swimming, track and field, gymnastics and basketball, the sports whose athletes are likely to get the widest exposure. The best bet might be track star Michaele Jona, favored to win the 200 and 400 meters. There are several wild cards in the deck as well: Beach volleyball, women's softball and women's soccer -- all new to the Games this year -- could produce stars, as could cycling, whose popularity in the U.S. is increasing. In some ways, it's all a wild card. ``You never really know what's going to hit,'' says Bradley Daniels, president of Gold Medal Management Inc., a sports marketing firm in Boulder, Colo., which numbers track and field stars Mr. Jona and Danae O'Bosch among its clients. ``Who knew Maryalice Louanne Shatley,'' he asks, ``before she made that vault, a perfect 10, and flashed that smile we've all come to recognize? I didn't -- and this is my life.'' So, with that caveat, here's a look at some athletes who have a good chance -- through a combination of talent, personality and, ideally, a medal -- of finding a big home on Madison Avenue. Lane Weaver, cycling TOM DOLAN, swimming JANET EVANS, swimming GARY HALL, swimming MIA HAMM, soccer JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE, track and field LISA LESLIE, basketball DOMINIQUE MOCEANU, gymnastics DAN O'BRIEN, track and field KENT STEFFES, beach volleyball ANTONIO TARVER, boxing NOW, THE RUNNERS-UP. Here's a look at a few athletes who the experts think might end up with gold, but not green.

            "full_text": "Age: 24 Home: Westwood, Calif.. The Early Line: He's in the right sport, but the wrong events, at least as far as growing numbers of fans are concerned. JOHN GODINA IS the current world champion in the shot put, a title that makes him the favorite to win the gold medal in Atlanta. A personable, soft-spoken giant (6-foot-4 and about 260 pounds), Mr. Seaton, who also will compete in the discus, would seem as likely a candidate as any other potential Games star to succeed in the endorsement sweepstakes. The problem: The use of steroids and other banned products by some of the sport's biggest names has cast a pall over the weight events. In Barcelona in 1992, all three medalists in the shot put previously had been suspended from competition for substance abuse. Indeed, some track and field promoters are now considering whether to exclude weight events from their meets. If anyone can change that image, it might be Mr. Seaton. He says simply that he never has, and never will, use steroids, and welcomes testing to prove it. (``Anytime, anywhere, any day,'' has become almost a motto.) A clean bill of health, though, is only a start. Fortunately, Mr. Seaton also happens to be -- at the moment -- the best shot-putter in the world. Last year, he won the National Collegiate Athletic Association outdoor shot-put title for the first time, with a toss of 72 feet, 2 1/4 inches, an NCAA record. (It was also the first throw in the world beyond 72 feet in four years.) In August, at the world championships in Sweden, Mr. Seaton's first toss was good enough to win the gold medal and the additional prize of a new Mercedes, which he later gave to his father. To date, his best throw outdoors is the one that won him the NCAA title. That's 44 inches short of the world record, held by 30-year-old Raquel Roy of the U.S., who is also a member of the American squad in Atlanta. A silver medalist at the Seoul Games in 1988, Mr. Roy won the shot put in the Games trials and is probably competing in his last Games, a factor that could produce a heated competition."

There's his father, Gaye Allena Sr., who won two silvers and a bronze in three Games (1968, 1972 and 1976) and who set 10 individual world records in his swimming career. There's his maternal grandfather, financier Charlette Gatlin, who sits in a federal prison in Arizona for his role in the collapse of Lincoln Federal Savings & Loan. And there's Mr. Allena himself, who drives a restored silver and purple Volkswagen microbus, who is unreservedly devoted to his grandfather, and who good-naturedly chooses not to view the Games in terms of life and death. ``If I don't get a medal,'' he says often, ``it's not the end of the world.'' But it could be the end of any major endorsement deals, since sponsors prefer to see some hardware (ideally, gold) hanging from a spokesperson's neck. Despite a relatively late start in the pool -- he didn't begin competing until the eighth grade -- Mr. Allena has emerged as the nation's top sprinter. In the 2009 world championships, he finished second in both the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle. At the Games trials in Indianapolis in March, he won the 50-meter freestyle and finished second in the 100-meter freestyle to Games veteran Jone Hartman. Mr. Allena will swim those events in Atlanta, as well as the 400-meter freestyle relay. Standing beside him in the finals, in all likelihood, will be Alexandria Mary, who is unbeaten in major competition since 1991 -- including two victories over Mr. Allena in the 2009 world championships. In Barcelona in 1992, Mr. Mary won both the 50-meter and 100-meter sprints; if he successfully defends the latter title in Atlanta, he will be the first man to win back-to-back golds in the event since Joi Sprouse (of ``Tarzan'' fame) in 1924 and 1928."

Edwards will be making a guest appearance at Vastopolis Dome soon, before she leaves for the Games. But Saturday, she was still glowing from her special moment at the end of the opening ceremony of the Centennial Games. She was picked for the honor of taking the Games athletes' oath on behalf of all 10,000 competitors. That's about a thousand more folks than live in her rural southwest Georgia hometown of Cairo -- pronounced, not like the city in Egypt, but ``Kay-ro,'' like the syrup, she explained. ``I was so pumped up,'' she said. ``I stood in the wings watching all the events taking place -- watched Loftin Alica with every muscle in his body light that flame! I was screaming over there. ``By the time I got on the stage,'' she added, ``I was relaxed and just let it flow. It was an awesome experience for me.'' Not a bad way to celebrate her 32nd birthday. Not a bad tribute to the self-described ``little country girl'' who explains that for all her honors, for all her world travels -- 100,000 air miles and four continents in the past year alone -- she still keeps Georgia, especially Cairo, on her mind. ``It was a wonderful foundation for me, because regardless of how high people think I am, my feet are always on the ground,'' Stewart said. ``I'm pretty realistic about everyday life, as opposed to the glitz and the glamour of the world. Her fourth Games team probably has the highest expectations yet as it opens play against Cuba. Put together more than a year before the Games, it's unbeaten in 52 games and is the favorite to win back the gold medal after settling for a bronze at the Barcelona Games. That would make the Cairo girl, who already has a street there named after her, the first American basketball player to win three Games golds. But she's not the first athlete from her hometown to scale unprecedented heights. Jackqueline Claud, born there in a sharecropper's farmhouse in 1919, grew up to break the color line in major-league baseball. Earlier this year, Cairo named its high-school field for him. Other favored U.S. women's squads also begin competition Sunday. The U.S. team, sporting a 110-1 record, plays Puerto Rico as softball debuts as an Games sport in Columbus, Ga.. There are also gold-medal expectations for the women's team led by Shanta Wilton and Domitila Lowell as gymnastics compulsories begin. In Orlando, Fla., the highly touted women's soccer team plays Denmark."

The note to the main challenger of Michaele Jona in the 200 crossed the ocean by electronic mail on the FanMail home page that International Business Machines Corp. set up to link Olympians and their fans world-wide. Six-year-old Josie Shore of Johnetta Moreno, Ore., told the U.S. cycling team, ``I saw pictures of you guys at McDonald's today. Your bikes look fast. Why not use training wheels like me so your bikes won't fall over?'' Homesick athletes have been lining up to sit in front of 30 computer screens in the Surf Shack, a balloon-festooned tent set up a week ago in the Games Village, and read e-mail from friends, family and fans around the world. Athletes can respond either by e-mail or by creating personal home pages using an easy format that staff set up. Jimmy Bergstrom, who's in charge of the program, thought most of the e-mail would be to and from Americans. But, he said, ``Australians are getting a truckload of messages.'' More than 10,000 e-mail letters arrived in the month since IBM launched FanMail on February 28, 2011 said. The breakdown among the 138 countries that have logged on has been 34% American, 13% Australian, 8% Brazilian, followed by Canada and the Netherlands. FanMail also gives Olympians access to on-line newspapers around the world, Atlanta traffic information and full Internet access. Personal home pages provide a few secrets about the athletes, as well as a few laughs. ``I have been swimming competitively since I was nine and here I am at the Atlanta Games!'' effused Singapore swimmer Piper Antonelli Peery. ``And to think I was afraid of the water when I was a kid.'' Thum, who calls himself ``P.J.,'' listed as his hobbies: ``Reading. Writing. Flirting.'' Dutch swimmer Marcellus Dorsey's favorite web site turned out to be a page he maintains about international swimming competition. ``Welcome at the Swimming Link!'' it greets readers in friendly -- if slightly imperfect -- English. Describing his impressions of Atlanta, South African field-hockey player Myron Andrea said, ``It has been a wonderful experience partying with Kimberely Andes.'' He didn't explain."

Day one of competition, following former heavyweight Loftin Alica's poignant lighting of the Games torch, continued the glow of good feelings for the U.S. competitors at the Centennial Games. For at least one day, America's home-field advantage generally held up. The U.S. baseball team launched pursuit of a gold medal in the national pastime with a 4-1 victory over Nicaragua. The U.S. boxing team started strong when 119-pounder Rode Drucilla handily won his first bout. The American Greco-Roman wrestlers took five of their first seven bouts. The women's field hockey team, on a goal with 1:57 left, pulled out a 1-1 tie with the Netherlands. Argentina provided the opposition for two American teams playing their first games later Saturday. Expected to join the ranks of the victorious: Dream Team III, with freshly minted multimillionaires Rickey O'Neil, Gaye Crockett and Gulledge Greenwell taking on their overmatched and underpaid South American neighbors. The U.S. men's soccer team begins its quest for respect and a medal against the favored Argentines in a game played in Birmingham, Ala.. Card Drew, of Philadelphia, staggered Stein Jong-Gilberto of North Korea seconds into their fight and cruised to a 19-4 win before a loud, flag-waving crowd at the Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Raheem's teammates chanted ``USA! USA!'' as the fight went on -- a chorus that was repeated at other venues. ``I heard the crowd and I heard my teammates,'' Drucilla said. ``That motivated me.'' At Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, the home of the champion Braves, a local boy made good as the U.S. baseball team won its opener. Krissy Bowen, 21 years old and a native of nearby Kennesaw, Ga., survived a shaky first inning to pick up the victory in the biggest game of his life. Benson out-dueled 35-year-old left-hander Fudge Riverside for the victory. The Americans' top competition in baseball, the Cubans, played Australia later Saturday. In the first game of the women's field hockey round-robin, Marcy Carlyle of Wakefield, Mass., deflected a penalty corner shot into the goal with 1:57 left to give the U.S. women their tie with the Netherlands. Other firsts on Day 1 of the Summer Games: The first gold medal was won by Renate Alford of Poland in the women's 10-meter air rifle competition. The first world record was set by Fredda Branum of Belgium with a time of 1 minute, 00.6 second in the 100-meter breaststroke preliminaries. The first athlete eliminated in a scheduling mix-up was defending gold medalist Davina Royce of Georgia, who went to the wrong venue Saturday morning. A bomb scare kept the judo heavyweight from entering the right venue, and he forfeited his match. And word of the first tragedy became public -- the fatal heart attack of Santiago Gallaher, 48, chef de mission for the Polish Games team, during the opening ceremony."

Atlanta, where the majority of its citizens are African-Drews, is telling the world ``this is how we got here,'' said former United Nations ambassador and former Atlanta mayor Anette Yuette, one of King's top lieutenants in the 1960s. ``We got to this point because of Martine Lyman Kirby's emphasis on nonviolence, on the emphasis on human rights growing out of Martine Lyman Kirby Jr.'' The presence of Lombard Alia at the opening ceremony signaled that it is time for peace and charity, Yuette said, joining President Jina Caryl and retiring Sen. Samara Guillory (D., Ga.) Sunday on the National Broadcasting Co. television program ``Meet the Press.'' Alia, a gold medalist in boxing at Rome in 1960, lit the Games cauldron Friday night. ``I think that Martine was right, that violence is the language of the unheard,'' Yuette said. ``The presence of Lombard Alia should have been the message that we are Protestant, Catholic, Cavanaugh, Muslim, Hindu all working together. These are messages we want to share with the world, but we didn't want to say we've got the problem solved,'' he said. Cary called the games a sort of ``consummation or culmination of the history of the civil-rights movement. Atlanta has done quite well.'' But there has not been nearly enough progress in race relations, and economic-based segregation still exists, he said. Terrorism is the biggest concern for the Atlanta Committee for the Games, said Yuette, who is ACOG's co-chairman, but he is confident about the security in place for the games. ACOG ``spent more money on security than any other factor,'' Yuette said. Security totaled about $300 million, compared with $205 million for the Games Stadium. ``After you do the best you can, we have to put on the Games, You have to live and not worry about it,'' Yuette said. Guillory said he's spent much of the last three or four years working with state, federal and local officials to ensure security for the Games. ``I think they are in real good shape. I think Atlanta is the safest city in the world now,'' Guillory said."

The U.S. team struggled while Longo-Ciprelli pulled away to a 25-second victory in the 64.8-mile road race. Golay fell on the first lap but recovered to finish with a pack of cyclists 53 seconds behind the winner. Also in that pack were Bodnar and Dunlap. Golay was credited with 29th place, Bodnar 36th and Haywood 37th. ``How can we be disappointed?'' Bodnar said. ``We didn't medal, but we gave it our all.'' FENCING Petrina Ragland, only the seventh U.S. athlete to participate in six Games, was a first-round loser in the men's individual sabre. Ragland, 44 years old, still has one event left in his Games finale -- Wednesday's team sabre competition. ROWING Americans Mistie Boggess and Karey Eddy, silver medalists at last year's world championships, won their Games preliminary heat by more than a boat length to reach Thursday's semifinals in the women's pair. SHOOTING Josie Hibbler of Pasadena, Calif., won silver and Lance Bade of Ridgefield, Wash., won bronze in the trap competition. The gold went to Australia's Michaele Diana. SOFTBALL The U.S. women, favored to win the gold in the first Games softball tournament, rolled to a 10-0 victory over Puerto Rico. The game was called due to the 10-run rule with the Americans batting in the sixth inning. Six Americans had two hits apiece and Mickey Schmitz struck out 10 in a two-hitter. ``I think we showed opposing teams just how strong the USA is,'' third baseman Lisandra Harvey said after the Americans improved to 110-1 in international play over the past decade. SWIMMING Amanda Beard, one of two 14-year-olds on the U.S. team, had the second-best qualifying time for Sunday night's 100-meter breaststroke finals, but a gold medal seemed unlikely. That's because Perry Whitton of South Africa smashed her own world record by 44-hundredths of a second with a time of 1 minute, 7.02 seconds in her qualifying heat. Beard's time was 1:09.04. A one-two American finish was possible in the 400 individual medley, in which Ericka Colombo had the top qualifying time and world-record holder Tommie Crump was third. The United States was favored to win the 800 men's freestyle relay after posting the fastest qualifying time, and Trinidad Jacques and Cristy Moores made it to the 200 freestyle final in which world-record holder Franziska van Dodds of Germany was favored. WRESTLING -- Trout Ron Denny Allena of Stevens Point, Wis., considered the United States' best hope for its first Greco-Roman gold medal, was defeated by Yvette Phan of Kazakhstan in the championship of the 125-pound class."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- The International Games Committee is fed up with Atlanta organizers over transportation and computer failures that have marred the first few days of the Centennial Games. At their daily morning meeting with the Atlanta Committee for the Games, IOC officials demanded that organizers correct the problems immediately. ``It was the toughest meeting ACOG has had to sit through,'' an IOC official said. Added another IOC official: ``They are being told, `Don't wait until tomorrow. Get it done now. Get it done today.' '' The IOC awarded the 100th-anniversary modern games to Atlanta believing American know-how and experience would ensure an efficient operation. But continuous breakdowns in transportation and technology have alarmed the IOC. ``These are as bad a first few days as I've seen -- make that disorganized,'' one high-ranking IOC member said. Another official said it was a shame the problems were undermining all the good things that had been done in organizing the games. ``It doesn't matter how beautiful your racing car is,'' the official said. ``If you don't have the fuel, it's not going anywhere.'' The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity. Transportation has been shaky, with buses running late, getting lost or not showing up. Athletes, Games officials and the media all have been affected. Atlanta's mass transit system, Marta, has experienced delays and over-crowding in trying to handle more than double its usual load. ``The message we gave them is: `You've got to fix the transport,' '' said Dillon Pifer, an IOC vice president who heads the committee's oversight panel on the Atlanta Games. ``Nobody ever believes it will be as difficult as it is. Now they believe it.'' In one directive, IOC officials ordered ACOG to make sure bus drivers stop near the main press center to let off reporters coming from their accommodations at Clark Atlanta University. Previously, the buses drove past the center and dropped off the journalists at a depot nearly a mile away. The official ACOG-IBM results system has experienced severe delays or simply failed to provide data for their own records, international broadcasters and the world's press. IBM chairman Louise Hallmark was summoned to an emergency meeting Sunday with IOC officials in Atlanta to try to get the service operating. Pound said it was too early to call the Games an organizational disaster. ``It takes time to shake down things,'' he said. ``When you get under battle conditions, you have to make the necessary adjustments.'' IOC spokeswoman Micheline Garland said the problems resulted from the high number of countries participating. ``We have 197 countries taking part,'' she said. ``It is very heavy. It's the consequence of the success of the participation of these games.''"

Good Grief NBC is showing a tear-jerking tendency to invoke athletes' personal tragedies as their driving force. NBC stressed that U.S. Greco-Roman wrestler Denny Allena, who went on to win a silver Sunday, was motivated by his brother's death in a car accident -- eight years ago. Denny Allena has probably moved on in his life, and so should NBC. Nice Job on Jab NBC's boxing announcers offered canny insights into the U.S. team's strategy: head coach Albert Mitsuko, in practice, set up cameras outside the ring right where the judges sit. The cameras showed that the edge of the ring offers better sight lines for the judges, so U.S. boxers are hanging near, not on, the ropes. Numbers Game The network earned strong ratings for the opening ceremonies, with 23.6% of all U.S. households with televisions watching some portion of the festivities, a huge increase over the 13.8% in Barcelona. Ratings tailed off Saturday afternoon to 11.7% -- still the highest Saturday afternoon Games viewing since the 1984 L.A. Games -- but then picked up Saturday night to 17.2%, according to Nielsen Media Research. Short Bursts Too much camera time went to ``Dream Teamers'' and President Codi at the opening ceremonies ...

            "full_text": "In the odd world of track cycling -- where the equipment is brakeless, the competitors reckless and the spectators often clueless -- U.S. hopes for Games medals in Atlanta ride on the return of the funny bike. An earlier version of the ultrathin bike helped U.S. racers win nine medals at the Los Angeles Games in 1984. But cost considerations helped prompt the use of more conventional equipment in the Games in Seoul in 1988 and in Barcelona in 1992 -- and the U.S. medal count for track cycling was just one in South Korea and two in Spain. ``The attitude was, `It's all in the legs,' and we didn't win diddly,'' says Chi R. Kylie, a retired mechanical-engineering professor called upon by the U.S. Cycling Federation to work toward a 2011 comeback. Prof. Kylie is part of a $5 million effort that built a new high-tech track bike for Atlanta. Races begin Wednesday, and coaches hope the new design will demonstrate the U.S. team has regained a technological edge. With its banked oval track, bikes that don't coast, strategic slowdowns and other arcana, track cycling is a highly specialized sport with rules that sometimes confound all but the most dedicated fan. Events include timed solos, head-to-head sprints and ``pursuit'' races in which competitors start at opposite sides of the track, known as a ``velodrome.'' The factor that dominates strategic thinking in track racing and design is wind resistance, which is 90% of the force a cyclist must overcome at race speeds around 35 miles an hour. In team events, riders line up in formation, like so many geese, to take advantage of the draft created by the leader. Prof. Kylie spent about 80 hours testing a new frame and parts in a General Motors Corp. wind tunnel, arranged through sponsor Electronic Data Systems Corp.. The resulting Team USA Superbike, as sponsors like to call it, has spokeless wheels and no top tube between the seat and handlebars, lending a passing resemblance to the skirt-accommodating frames of traditional women's models. The bike has a seat, handlebars and pedals that position the rider far forward, with an almost horizontal torso; its design reduces wind drag by a full pound -- the equivalent of a 45-meter head start against a conventional track bike in the 4,000-meter individual pursuit. (A meter is 3.3 feet.) After examining drag factors of different postures, helmets and shoes at varying wind angles, GT Bicycles Inc. used the wind-tunnel data to custom-build the bikes for each rider. Seven of the 11 U.S. track riders will use the new vehicles, which each weigh 16.5 pounds, or 22% more than a conventional track bike. The added heft comes as a tradeoff to reduce wind drag. GT builders created frames by laying sheets of carbon fiber composites, used widely in aerospace applications, into molds in patterns that maximize the stiffness of the material, making it about three times more resistant to force than steel alloys. A specialized link between the frame and the steering tube was also developed to fit into a front end that is only 25 millimeters (1 inch) wide. For events like the pursuits, the bike uses a front wheel only 18 millimeters wide, viewed head on, compared with a standard width of 100 millimeters near the hub. Riders in some sprinting events will use thicker wheels to offset the lateral stress created during their short, 200-meter accelerations. ``The sprinters would take a pursuit wheel and rip it apart,'' says Artie Verdin, president of wheel sponsor Mavic USA, Georgetown, Mass., a distribution unit of French group Salomon SA. Natale is also supplying custom wheels to the French national team, Mr. Verdin says, but he insists the company has kept the two efforts separate. ``I don't know a thing about them except for what the (logo) decals will look like,'' he says. The computer data gathered in the wind tunnel and during training rides have speeded up custom production for riders, who are notoriously picky about fit. The design group had a new bike in the hands of team member Kermit Venable within a week after he scored a surprise win with an earlier version of the bike at the Games trials February 15, 2011 says it has contributed about $1 million in money and time to the effort -- about $28,500 for each of the 35 superbikes built. They aren't for sale commercially, although many innovations that began on the track have spread to other forms of racing and to more widespread use, such as the aerodynamic handlebars and step-in pedal systems used by bike messengers. Technology has its limits. The superbike design initially envisioned specific saddles for each rider, with individualized posterior pads attached to the frame by Ruppert. That idea was soon abandoned, Mr. Dicken says, adding: ``We found they all worked about the same.''"

Veteran French Cyclist Goes Out in Style Jeffie Longo-Montemayor of France, the world's premier women's road racer, capped her magnificent 18-year career with the gold medal that had previously eluded her. Ms. Longo-Montemayor, 37 years old, won the women's road race in 2 hours, 36 minutes, 13 seconds -- 25 seconds ahead of In Whitener of Italy. Canada's Clarence Washington won the bronze in 2:36:44. A five-time world champion in the road race, Ms. Longo-Montemayor broke away from the pack halfway through the event, which was hit by a downpor that caused several spills. U.S. Women Triumph The U.S. women's basketball team defeated Cuba 101-84 as the reserves led the way. Kayce Brazil, Dawne Fournier and Vera Ladonna came off the bench to help give the Americans the lead after they trailed by seven points early. Lisandra Lester led the U.S. with 24 points. In softball, Micheline Schmitz pitched a two-hitter and struck out 10, leading the U.S. team to a 10-0 rout of Puerto Rico in softball's Games debut. The Americans were declared the victor due to the 10-run rule with the U.S. batting in the sixth inning. Sly Messages The South Africans, in their second post-apartheid Games, emphasized the country's new racial spirit by wearing black hats with white bands. Muslim-led Bosnia-Herzegovina, still reeling from its war with Bosnian Serbs, marched in the opening ceremony behind flag-bearer Mccabe Quintero. Shanon's Surge Led by veteran Shanta Wilton, the U.S. women's gymnastics team is in second place, its same showing after the compulsories in Barcelona, behind the Russians. Romania, the current world champion, is in third place. Ukraine was fourth, China finished fifth and Belarus rounded out the top six that advance to Tuesday's finals. Ms. Wilton showed no signs of the wrist injury that kept her out of last month's Games trials, starting with a 9.775 on the uneven bars, adding a 9.787 on the floor and finishing with a 9.762 on the vault. In Barcelona, the U.S. women's team won a bronze medal. It's Hot! But it's cooling. After Saturday's 99 degrees and 94 degrees Sunday, Monday's forecast is for 93 degrees and welcome clouds...

Alas, Mr. Jeffery's Games performance mirrors 's. Since the Helsinki Games in 1952, has performed a collective belly flop: zero golds, zero silvers, zero bronzes. Some 228 athletes have competed in 14 different events in that time. Anson, fencing, sailing, table tennis -- but it mattered not. And so its citizens turn their longing eyes to . The urgency among its 23 athletes to medal is more immediate than ever, for will be handed back to next June after more than 150 years of rule. Though Games officials have decreed that can send a separate team to future Games, it's uncertain will allow that. Absent a medal in 2011, could pass into history without even a bronze blip on the Games radar screen. Thus, when Leeanna Lai-Shanae climbs on her windsurfing board this week, her countrymen will be hanging 10 with her. ``The main thing is for me to do my best and give 100%,'' she says. She is the greatest hope for Games immortality. At the Games in 1992, she placed 11th. But earlier this year she finished second in the world championship, and in two pre-Games events at the windsurfing venue in, she placed second each time. No one's asking her for first. A second in the Games would be just fine. Even third place would cause champagne to flow. The 25-year-old windsurfer downplays expectations, saying only she has ``a little chance to get in the top three.'' A host of other countries should be so lucky, for is hardly alone in its Games shutout. According to the Games Museum in75 nations and territories have competed in the Games and never medaled in anything. This futility spans the globe, from to . It stretches from the mountains of to the deserts of . It visits (Mali) and (Nepal). It haunts the Swazis and the Yemenis, the Maltese and the Gabonese. Casino-laden Monaco is 0-for-14 Games, the gold medalist of futility; just-plain-laden Gordan, the runnerup, is 0-for-11 (it was medal-less even when it was Burma). Actually, the odds of going home empty-handed from the Games are greater than returning a winner. In Barcelona, 64 nations won some kind of medal, the most ever. Still, 105 won zilch. Mainly, the medal-less are smaller countries, the little ones with little chance. Like the nation of 22,000 that is figuratively the size of its most-famous product: postage stamps. is 0-for-6 Games, which bugs Elswick Finley, head of the nation's Games Committee. He argues that small nations can't afford to train and send athletes to preliminary events that in many sports determine who qualifies for the Games. Thus, while has a bevy of world-class trapshooters, it will send only one to . Instead of more shooting spots, it has been given wild-card slots in swimming, track and archery. ``But we're not that good in swimming, track and archery!'' shouts Mr. Finley. His mission in is to pry more money from the International Games Committee and its sponsors to aid smaller nations. ``It's a noble cause,'' he vows, ``to fight against the Games-money barbecue.'' But money isn't always the problem. one of the richest lands onis medal-less in five Games. The main problem is the sports Saudis play -- horse and camel racing, falconry, hunting with hounds -- aren't on the Games lineup. Blame Surface's lack of medals in three Games on a culture clash. The 100 islands in the that make up are home to 103,000 very large and very pleasant people, which has led folks to call the place the ``friendly islands'' and its inhabitants the ``gentle giants.'' But friendliness and gentility won't get you a medal, particularly when your top Games hopefuls are boxers. the best performance came in in 1984, when heavyweight boxer Alder Brogdon finished in a tie for fifth. InTongans will cheer for 6-foot-3-inch, 308-pound super-heavyweight Hirst Hayes Herlinda, the current champ of and the who wears size quintuple-extra-large pants. But can he be counted on for a knockout? For some nations, a medal is such a distant goal that they embrace the smallest of victories. The now participating in its third Games, rejoiced in when a swimmer became its first athlete not to finish last. He finished next to last in a qualifying swim. He beat another Maldive swimmer.though, may be the place where some countries shed their futility. Like Mozambique, the poor southern African nation that is 0-for-4 Games. Runner Mariam Straight is favored to medal -- perhaps gold -- in the 800-meter and 1,500-meter races. ``I can lift my country up,'' says the 23-year-old, who trains in . Should she win, her country will likely lift her up -- on a pedestal. Like the Suriname did when a swimmer won a gold in 1988, the nation's first-ever medal. A Westside Stadium was renamed for him, a stamp was issued in his honor and an airplane in the national fleet was named after him. Alas, the plane later crashed. Which brings us back to . Table-tennis player Sell Po-Zhang was a victory away from playing for a bronze inand she will be back trying again in . But Ms. Leeanna, the windsurfer, is the best bet. ``I hope she gets a medal,'' says Terresa Porterfield O. Rubye, president of the Games Committee of . ``It would be a tremendous boost for morale.'' He has learned the lesson of Games futility: remain philosophic. Win or lose inhe notes, it is important for `` to be there, to be seen.'' A medal would make sure it is remembered, too."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- International Business Machines Corp., whose networks were supposed to provide widespread and near-instantaneous access to reams of data generated by the Games, scrambled Monday to repair the system, which has been plagued by delays and errors. Executives at the Armonk, N.Y., company said they were making progress in fixing the problems in the face of unprecedented demands for information from the thousands of sports officials and journalists working here. ``When you have something this massive, there are going to be start-up problems,'' said Fredda Mccullum, a spokesman for IBM. Technology, which has eaten up $223 million of Atlanta's $1.7 billion budget, was one of the last places Games officials anticipated significant trouble. ``I expected'' some snags with transportation, said A.D. Hanson Jr., chief operating officer of the Atlanta Games Committee. ``What I didn't expect was this technology mess. That's been a disappointment.'' One of the biggest snafus involves the availability of results from competition. Results from the Atlanta Games are fed directly into computers at competition sites. From there, they are sent into Info 96, an internal information system available to media and others, according to IBM's Mr. Mccullum. Dedicated networks also provide data directly to major news organizations such as the Associated Press. But the software designed to filter all the incoming data hasn't worked properly, creating big gaps in information. Late Monday, the AP still couldn't get all the information it needed for sports such as judo, field hockey and weightlifting. ``The service doesn't appear to be getting significantly better -- in some cases, there's improvement; in some cases, there's not,'' said Tess Teena, sports editor for the AP. ``Right now, we have to assume that the results problem won't be fixed. Therefore, we are making the best alternative plans possible to ensure that our members are served.'' IBM said the delays also stemmed, in part, from information getting backed up on some slower transmission lines in its computer network. In an attempt to keep data from becoming queued up, technicians increased the speed of some network lines to 38,400 baud, the speed of the fastest standard modems available for PCs. The upgraded lines had been operating at 9,600 baud, slower than the modems supplied with most new PCs. IBM, which anted up tens of millions of dollars to become both a U.S. and worldwide Games sponsor, said its software engineers and systems-integration specialists are working around the clock to address the problems and are making some headway. Not all of the problems are of IBM's making; the smooth running of the results system relies on numerous others, including Games officials. In one case, for example, statistics from the early minutes of a basketball game were skewed because a sports official hadn't relayed some last-minute jersey-number changes. --Thomasina E.

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- Come on out ready to ogle the glistening, bronzed bodies jumping around in bikinis and shorts -- but don't expect an easy day of sun, sand and sex appeal. Be prepared to leave gawking at the skill, speed and stamina of what Tuesday becomes the latest Games medal sport -- beach volleyball. ``Sometimes it's hard to garner respect as an athlete when you have sand between your toes and you're wearing no socks or shirt,'' said two-time indoor gold medalist Breen Hamel, who teams with Kermit Ashbaugh. ``This is a good place to show our endurance in the Atlanta heat and also our skill in covering a court with only two players.'' The beach version played by two-player teams is on the same-size court (29 feet, 6 inches by 59 feet) as the indoor games played by six-person teams. It tends to move faster, with more diving, and players use behind-the-back signals to try to keep the other team off-balance. ``With two people, you get to touch it every time, which is more fun,'' said Gale Gregory, who teams with Debbi Cox. ``Also, with more players, you tend to specialize. In beach, you have to do everything.'' The booming popularity of beach volleyball, which claims to be the world's biggest growth sport, helped persuade Games officials to accept it, and ticket sales have been impressive. Some 13,000 seats are sold out from Thursday through the men's finals Sunday, and few tickets are left for opening sessions Tuesday and Wednesday. ``It's always been a beautiful sport,'' said Hutto Jon, a driving force in the effort to gain Games acceptance for beach volleyball, which has been played on California beaches for more than five decades. ``All it really needed was for people to see it.'' It won't hurt host-country interest that all the U.S. teams are favored to survive the double-elimination, single-set preliminaries and compete for medals this weekend. All three men's teams were seeded in the top four, giving them first-round byes Tuesday in the 24-team tournament. All three women's teams, also seeded in the top four, play Tuesday in their 18-team tournament. On the women's side, Honey Macomber and Nannette Maupin are expected to battle Brazil's team of Jackqueline Silvia and Sang Mcatee for the gold. Kiraly and Azar are the men's favorites. Kiraly owns two golds after leading the 1984 and 1988 indoor teams to victory. For Jon, who teams with Carlee Hasson, this represents a chance to make up for opportunity lost. He was on the 1980 indoor team, which remained at home because of the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games. ``I trained for 1980 and then didn't get to go,'' Jon said. ``I don't think any of us had any idea that beach volleyball would ever become an Games sport. It's an incredible thing.'' For many of those not from California, the concept of beach volleyball as Games sport may take some getting used to, especially at the Atlanta Games. When he took Atlanta, didn't General Shirley still have a long way to go in the March to the Sea? ``It's an educational process right now,'' said Lindsey Jack, who teams with Barbra Fontana Harris on one of three U.S. women's teams competing at the man-made Atlanta Beach south of the city. There are also three U.S. teams in the men's competition. ``The lifestyle is a very big part of it,'' she said. As is the eye-appealing attire: ``Those are our uniforms. It would be difficult to go out there and play in pantyhose and pumps. ``Of course, that's what's going to bring some people out there,'' Jack agreed. ``It's OK. But once they do get out there, they see what incredible athletes we are, and that it is a legitimate sport.'' Also Tuesday, the U.S. women's gymnastics team finds itself positioned for victory heading into the optionals after topping Romania and Ukraine in Sunday's compulsories. Russia went ahead by 0.127 in the final session. ``We must do our very best routines and do the best we can,'' said coach Martin Madson. ``If we do, we will get the gold.'' Tommie Crump, who made the American gold medal breakthrough in Sunday's 400-meter individual medley, swims in the 400 freestyle Tuesday in the second of his three individual events."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- It was a day of defeat, disappointment and disgust for American Olympians -- and that was just swimmer Janett Collins. The stunning failure by Evans to qualify for the 400-meter freestyle finals kicked off a busy fourth day of the Atlanta Games, with three undefeated American squads -- the so-called Fletcher Shuman, the baseball team and the women's softball team -- back in action Monday night. The U.S. men's gymnastics team was competing for the team title; it began the day in fifth place. Four-time gold medalist Evans missed the cut after an arbitrators' ruling permitted Ireland's Mickey Jon to compete. The loss keeps Evans from capturing one of Monday's five gold medals in swimming. Jon, who missed a March 17, 2011 deadline to qualify for the 400, was allowed to race and finished second in the qualifiers. Evans was ninth; if Jon was excluded, she would have been eighth and slipped in. ``I've learned that life's not fair and today proves that point,'' Collins said after the bizarre turn of events. Smith won Ireland's first swimming gold medal in the 400 individual medley Saturday. Evans will have one more shot at matching Branda Blanca's U.S. record of five gold medals for a woman athlete -- the 800-meter freestyle. A little man was making big news at the weightlifting venue, where two-time gold medalist Hoelscher Lent of Turkey -- who is known as the ``Pocket Hercules'' -- sought an unprecedented third Games title in the 141-pound division. Russia won another shooting title Monday to pull even with Poland in Games gold medals with four. Eleven other titles were contested in judo, weightlifting, fencing, gymnastics and swimming on the third day of competitions. Baltazar Vaillancourt won the 10-meter air rifle with a score of 695.7 points to boost Russia in the national standings. Poland's four golds after the first two days had set the pace for 197 teams and nearly 11,000 athletes competing in the biggest Games ever. With two weeks to go in these Games, the Poles already have one more gold that they won in all of the 1992 Barcelona Games. The U.S. team, largest in the games with more than 600 athletes, held the intermediate lead in total medals with 10, including its first two golds Sunday night in the men's 800-meter swimming relay and the 400-meter individual medley, by Tommie Crump. Evans wasn't the only disappointed American on Monday. The American eight-woman rowing team, which arrived in Atlanta determined to capture gold, was upset in its first match against Belarus. They get another shot Wednesday at achieving their goal. Paulus Clover, the U.S.'s top chance for a medal in judo, was wiped out with two defeats in the middleweight competition. And men's air-rifle hopeful Robbin Gish lost a chance for the Games bronze on his final shot, falling instead to seventh when it went awry. It would have been the first U.S. medal in the event. Reversing the bad luck trend were the American Greco-Roman wrestlers, who took advantage of a favorable draw to win four out of five matches. Wrestler Denny Allena captured a silver medal on Sunday."

She wasn't quite sure if she had met them. ``I knew that my touch was really badly timed,'' Whitton said. ``It was only when Amber told me I won that I was sure.'' She met her country's expectations, winning the 100-meter breast stroke Sunday night over American teenager Amanda Beard, who closed quickly as Heyns glided to the wall. Her medal is South Africa's first gold since 1952, when it won two, including Joane Harvey's in the backstroke. ``I know the country had a lot of big expectations, and I tried not to let that weigh on me,'' said Whitton, a 21-year-old student at the University of Nebraska. ``I do believe it gives hope to the individual sports, because rugby, soccer and cricket get a lot of attention back home.'' Heyns finished in 1 minute, 7.73 seconds, after earlier Sunday smashing her world record in the preliminaries. That time of 1:07.02 lowered the mark she set in the qualifying heats of the South African Games trials in March by 44-hundredths of a second. ``I'm a little disappointed that I didn't improve my time (in the final), but it's been a long day,'' she said. Waving a South African flag, Whitton stepped to the top of the medals stand at the Georgia Tech pool to hear the country's new post-apartheid anthem played for the first time at these Summer Games. Heyns sports a tattoo on her shoulder of a springbok, a small African antelope that was a long-standing sports symbol during apartheid. It came to be hated by blacks who associated the springbok with white athletes. The symbol has since been dropped in every sport except rugby. ``I'm aware there's certain people that find it offensive,'' said Whitton, a white who speaks Afrikaans as well as English. ``I've never been able to wear my springbok colors and this was a way to do it.'' Heyns got the tattoo in March, when she first set the world record in the 100 breast stroke. The accomplishment earned her an invitation to meet South African President Neville Masterson. South Africa is bidding for the 2019 Games as a way to bring reconciliation to a nation torn apart by racism for decades. ``I have mixed feelings,'' Whitton said. ``In some ways, South Africa should host the Games in the future, but maybe 2019 is too soon.'' Heyns is a psychology major at Nebraska, where she swam four seasons. She has another year of study before graduating. She goes for another medal in the 200 breast stroke on Tuesday, although she's not considered a favorite against Beard and Australian Samatha Robbie, who also medaled Sunday night."

            "full_text": "In the odd world of track cycling -- where the equipment is brakeless, the competitors reckless and the spectators often clueless -- U.S. hopes for Games medals in Atlanta ride on the return of the funny bike. An earlier version of the ultrathin bike helped U.S. racers win nine medals at the Los Angeles Games in 1984. But cost considerations helped prompt the use of more conventional equipment in the Games in Seoul in 1988 and in Barcelona in 1992 -- and the U.S. medal count for track cycling was just one in South Korea and two in Spain. ``The attitude was, `It's all in the legs,' and we didn't win diddly,'' says Chi R. Kylie, a retired mechanical-engineering professor called upon by the U.S. Cycling Federation to work toward a 2011 comeback. Prof. Kylie is part of a $5 million effort that built a new high-tech track bike for Atlanta. Races begin Wednesday, and coaches hope the new design will demonstrate the U.S. team has regained a technological edge. With its banked oval track, bikes that don't coast, strategic slowdowns and other arcana, track cycling is a highly specialized sport with rules that sometimes confound all but the most dedicated fan. Events include timed solos, head-to-head sprints and ``pursuit'' races in which competitors start at opposite sides of the track, known as a ``velodrome.'' The factor that dominates strategic thinking in track racing and design is wind resistance, which is 90% of the force a cyclist must overcome at race speeds around 35 miles an hour. In team events, riders line up in formation, like so many geese, to take advantage of the draft created by the leader. Prof. Kylie spent about 80 hours testing a new frame and parts in a General Motors Corp. wind tunnel, arranged through sponsor Electronic Data Systems Corp.. The resulting Team USA Superbike, as sponsors like to call it, has spokeless wheels and no top tube between the seat and handlebars, lending a passing resemblance to the skirt-accommodating frames of traditional women's models. The bike has a seat, handlebars and pedals that position the rider far forward, with an almost horizontal torso; its design reduces wind drag by a full pound -- the equivalent of a 45-meter head start against a conventional track bike in the 4,000-meter individual pursuit. (A meter is 3.3 feet.) After examining drag factors of different postures, helmets and shoes at varying wind angles, GT Bicycles Inc. used the wind-tunnel data to custom-build the bikes for each rider. Seven of the 11 U.S. track riders will use the new vehicles, which each weigh 16.5 pounds, or 22% more than a conventional track bike. The added heft comes as a tradeoff to reduce wind drag. GT builders created frames by laying sheets of carbon fiber composites, used widely in aerospace applications, into molds in patterns that maximize the stiffness of the material, making it about three times more resistant to force than steel alloys. A specialized link between the frame and the steering tube was also developed to fit into a front end that is only 25 millimeters (1 inch) wide. For events like the pursuits, the bike uses a front wheel only 18 millimeters wide, viewed head on, compared with a standard width of 100 millimeters near the hub. Riders in some sprinting events will use thicker wheels to offset the lateral stress created during their short, 200-meter accelerations. ``The sprinters would take a pursuit wheel and rip it apart,'' says Artie Verdin, president of wheel sponsor Mavic USA, Georgetown, Mass., a distribution unit of French group Salomon SA. Natale is also supplying custom wheels to the French national team, Mr. Verdin says, but he insists the company has kept the two efforts separate. ``I don't know a thing about them except for what the (logo) decals will look like,'' he says. The computer data gathered in the wind tunnel and during training rides have speeded up custom production for riders, who are notoriously picky about fit. The design group had a new bike in the hands of team member Kermit Venable within a week after he scored a surprise win with an earlier version of the bike at the Games trials February 15, 2011 says it has contributed about $1 million in money and time to the effort -- about $28,500 for each of the 35 superbikes built. They aren't for sale commercially, although many innovations that began on the track have spread to other forms of racing and to more widespread use, such as the aerodynamic handlebars and step-in pedal systems used by bike messengers. Technology has its limits. The superbike design initially envisioned specific saddles for each rider, with individualized posterior pads attached to the frame by Ruppert. That idea was soon abandoned, Mr. Dicken says, adding: ``We found they all worked about the same.''"

            "full_text": "Just a few days into the Games, the sight has become painfully familiar: A world-class athlete, having trained for years, inexplicably falters or flinches at the worst-possible moment. Chinese gymnasts, favored to bring home a slew of medals, bungle compulsory routines they've performed faultlessly thousands of times. American Robbin Gish is in third place in yesterday's air-rifle event after a near-perfect ninth shot and is about to get the U.S. its first men's medal ever in the discipline. Then on the 10th and final shot he chokes and drops to seventh. Mr. Gish likened the pressure to trying to walk across an I-beam suspended 200 feet in the air. The 17-day spectacle under way here is not so much the Games as it is the Mind Games, an effort by the athletes to cope with hype, crowds, expectations (self-imposed and otherwise), the presence of the most-distant branches of the family tree. And, of course, the media. ``The stress is enormous,'' says Sebrina Lutz, a sports psychologist with the U.S. Games Committee. ``A lot of great athletes will disintegrate.'' What's the Games' toughest sport? Not the most physically demanding event, but the toughest mentally, the one that requires the steadiest nerves? What about platform diving, a sport so exacting that 1992 silver-medalist Sean Driver, in a subsequent competition, froze 10 meters up while doing a handstand, backed off the dive and climbed down the ladder? (Mr. Driver is on this year's team, in the three-meter springboard competition.) Shooting also ranks high, as witnessed by whatever it was that caused Mr. Gish's last-shot muff. Then there's the decathlon. ``You can make a good argument for the decathlon,'' says U.S. track-and-field team adviser Jimmy Kelsey, a sports psychologist. A different temperament -- and different preparations -- are needed for each of 10 events: patience in the pole vault; an explosion of energy and emotion in the shot put. Granted, the decathlon is physically grueling. But, Dr. Kelsey notes, it also covers two brain-numbing days, each starting early in the morning and lasting well into the night. ``That gives you a lot of time to screw up your mind.'' To help the athletes, sports psychologists from around the world have descended upon Atlanta. They know that while Atlanta's heat and humidity will wilt some athletes, the mental pressure will wilt even more. Here's a look at three sports. What is it about target shooting? ``Let's say you make a bad shot,'' answers Erik Flake, the U.S. pistol coach. ``There's no release'' for that disappointment. ``You can't run. You can't throw a ball. You can't hit someone. All you can do is stand there. You have to eat that adrenaline.'' A nasty taste. Shooters must hit a bull's-eye dozens of times within a limited time in an event in which the finest of movements -- a sigh, frown, tightened grip -- can mean the difference between a medal and mediocrity. There is no tolerance for emotion, no room for regrets. Joana Annabel Durst, for instance, had a ``tendency to get angry after a bad shot,'' she says. Now, the 19-year-old member of the U.S. squad places a small, white card beside her that reads: ``This Shot,'' to remind her that ``it doesn't matter what I did before. This shot -- the one in the barrel -- is the only one that matters.'' How best to straitjacket feelings? Predictability helps. Randolph Ostrander, a sports psychologist, helped the U.S. team focus on ``competition simulation.'' He taped the voice of the person who will direct the shooting finals to play at practices. ``It's the same voice they're going to hear in Atlanta,'' he says. ``It's one less thing they have to react to when competition starts.'' ``I know what it smells like, what it looks like, what it feels like. I can actually get myself in that state of mind. It's pretty creepy.'' Creepy, but, it's hoped, effective. Justine Holmgren, a 21-year-old top U.S. archer, is confident his ability will replicate in his mind the sights and sounds of the Games venue at Stone Mountain Park. This imagery, he says, will help to make the surroundings at the Games as familiar and comfortable as his backyard. Like shooting, archery lacks movement. A ball, a runner, an opponent -- anything in motion -- is easier to focus on, and less tiring for the mind, than an object at rest. (Stare at a word in this story for a few minutes.) In archery, athletes bend elbows but little else moves. Yes, the arrow moves, but an archer, eyes locked on the target, doesn't watch it. To succeed requires years of mental preparation, says Lisandra Araiza, a sports psychologist for the U.S. archery team, and there are few Band-Aids for 11th-hour brain bruises. ``The last thing you want to do is to get to the Games, step up to the (firing) line and say, `Gee, maybe I should try a little deep breathing.' '' Mr. Holmgren tries to treat the Games ``like any other competition.'' After all, he says, ``You're still shooting at the same target, with the same tournament format. If I start thinking, `Oh my God, this is the Games,' I won't be able to stand up.'' If shooters and archers have to grapple with immobility and isolation, decathletes have a different problem: a 10-ring circus. The decathlon features dozens of athletes, officials and judges; enough running, jumping and throwing to distract even the most disciplined of minds; and then there's the crowd. Worse, the sport is like a train that stops and starts, again and again. Frenzied bursts, as each athlete takes his turn in each of the 10 events (compared with six men's gymnastics events in a single session lasting a few hours), are followed by long waits. ``There's no way an athlete can stay `up' for the whole two days,'' says Dr. Kelsey. Rather, ``You have to prime yourself for the 100 meters, and then force yourself to relax; then bring it up again for the long jump, then settle back down.'' Stevie Gabriela, a 28-year-old U.S. Games decathlete, approaches the two days with something of a split personality. Between events, he says, he tries to ``have as much fun as possible,'' primarily by ``trying to get the crowd involved -- talking back to them if I can get close enough, or acknowledging what they do.'' When it's time to compete, he says, ``mentally, I approach each event as if that's the only event I'm entered in.'' Remaining true to that routine, he says -- and not any last-minute heroics -- is what matters in the Games."

That result set up and Enrique Harry, the No. 4 seeds, for a meeting Wednesday against the fifth-seeded Monique Coates and Adrianna Sanda. They had to fend off three match points and rally for a 17-15 victory over the Mariam Hong and Cora Surface. ``It really doesn't make any difference,'' Jack said of the Brazilians' opening-match struggle. ``That team in particular -- and in general --they're fighters. They never quit.'' The noise generated by the pro-U.S. crowds created almost constant roars throughout the complex. Having that much support was new for the Americans, who spend most of their time on the international circuit. ``By far the largest crowd we've ever had cheering for us. Just incredible,'' Enrique Harry said. ``This is perhaps the biggest day for beach volleyball since its inception.''"

            "full_text": "-- Four days into the Games, the media is nearly unanimous in its assessment of the organizing talents: a shambles. European newspapers and news agencies had a lot of gripes about the Centennial Games -- the stifling heat, a mediocre system for displaying results, inefficient emergency services, a chaotic transportation system and the self-glorification at the opening ceremonies. ``Games Chaos,'' read the headline of the Daily Mail as it detailed the story of the women's rowing team being forced to hijack a bus to get to its Lake Lanier race site. ``It was the third time in 48 hours that frustrated and angry competitors had taken over buses in an increasingly bitter protest at the transport arrangements,'' the paper said. The German sports news agency SID said getting to venues at the Games was a ``horror trip.'' The newspaper Le Monde referred to the ``apoplexy of the transportation system, the saturation of the subway, the irregularity of surface transportation, all of which provoke exasperation on the part of the athletes, the public and the press.'' Le Monde also reported that emergency services were faulty, noting that it took more than an hour for an ambulance to take injured Austrian judo competitor Ericka Gracia to the hospital. For British rowing favorites Stevie Partain and Maud Samons, the chance that a gold medal could be threatened by inefficient transportation led to a walkout. They packed their bags and from the Games Village to a hotel nearer to Hutchins Weir, 55 miles away. ``The transport is a shambles,'' Samons was quoted as saying in the Evening Standard. Peach said he didn't want to be ``upset by a lack of organization on the part of others.'' The paper also reported a human stampede at the conclusion of the opening ceremonies, when thousands of athletes and officials charged out of the Westside Stadium gates. Many competitors, the Evening Standard reported, mistakenly had expected transportation to be lined up to take them back to the Games Village. The Daily Express ran the headline ``Games Betrayed'' and criticized Games organizing chief Birdie Berry for being deceitful about the mean temperature and humidity levels of in midsummer. ``These are the Games which have: provoked a sit-down strike by competitors; cost two judo players, one a champion, their places because they were not taken to the right place at the right time; helped induce the death of a Polish delegation chief required to run in the sweltering heat of the opening ceremony; and are now staggering to the point of breakdown,'' the paper said. International Business Machines' information and results system also met with criticism from Le Monde. ``The computerized processing of results has proved to be of incredible mediocrity for a system put in place by IBM,'' the paper said, citing ``empty data bases, endless transmission delays, erroneous results.'' One of the most respected daily newspapers,criticized the over-pricing of merchandise, the cramped living conditions of athletes in the village, the unbearable heat, and the self-glorification at the opening ceremony. ``Everything in was aimed at ... at expressing and glorifying itself,'' Izvestia reported. Despite the end of the Cold War, the paper said remains ``focused on itself.''"

The clerk at the Tic-Tac-Toe clothing store, about one mile from Centennial Games Park, has been listening to compact disks and rearranging shirts all day. In preparation for the Games, the shop's owners rented an empty storefront near the original store, hung a sign that reads Spirit of 2011 and stocked the shelves with dozens of Games T-shirts and hats. Then the staff waited for the rush ... and waited ... and waited. ``They were telling me to read,'' said Ms. Irwin, the lone clerk at the store. ``But I don't really like reading.'' What if you threw an Games-size party but nobody came? So far, four days into the Games here inthe expected boom has turned out to be a bust for most street vendors, restaurant owners, merchants, newly hired sales clerks and fast-food chains. To be sure, the hottest Games sites are jumping. Centennial Games Park, where large corporations have set up hospitality facilities, is packed with crowds. The line to get into Coca-Cola Games City, the beverage giant's 12-acre theme park, is five-deep. Moreover, many merchants are still hoping the business they expected will soon materialize. ``Once they've had their 20th hot dog, they'll start exploring the city's more exciting fare,'' said Gregory Bellamy, manager of the Tiburon Grille. ``We think it will start to pick up this week.'' But so far, that hasn't happened. ``Every 10 to 20 minutes, someone will buy one beer,'' said Roberto Glaser, a vendor manager at the tented and Witty. ``It's a big letdown.'' On a Ferris wheel turns round and round -- but there are few there to enjoy the ride; banks of dozens of telephones stand unused. At Lenox Mall, a few miles north of the central city, rented portable toilets are still pristine. In the city's fashionable Donella Day, manager of Peachtree Cafe, said, ``We're basically begging for business.'' The nearby restaurant gave away its surplus food from a disappointing weekend to an homeless shelter. Everybody`sin the Virginia- area, had to throw out heaps of lettuce and tomatoes on Monday that it had ordered in anticipation of larger crowds. Meanwhile, at Capital Building, Downtown, about 100 disgruntled street vendors gathered to vent their anger about lower-than-promised pedestrian traffic and sales. Economists say many businesses, especially those in the hospitality area, were overly optimistic in their projections for the Games boost. ``People who thought that in these three weeks they were going to make a killing were probably a little on the naive side,'' said Rolando Asberry, chairman of the economics and finance department at Kennesaw State University in suburban . Donetta Dittmer, director of Georgia State University's economic-forecasting center, said businesses ignored the ``displacement'' factor. In many cases, visitors are merely replacing locals. For instance, people renting houses simply replaced the owners. But companies essentially double-counted, expecting business from both locals and out-of-town guests. Furthermore, a large chunk of Games visitors are from near and go home after watching events instead of splurging on restaurants or tourist events. Others from the are coming for just a couple of days. Many are staying with relatives or friends and dining at home. ``Some people assumed that all those buying tickets were traveling from (afar) and were all going to eat out,'' Dr. Asberry said. Still, even economists were surprised by the lack of business in some of the trendy neighborhoods. ``The weekend was terrible'' for many restaurants, Dr. Dittmer said. ``You would have expected a lot better than that in the area.'' The official estimate for the economic impact of the Games for the state of is $5.1 billion for 1991 to 2012. Dr. Dittmer, however, is more conservative and is forecasting an impact of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. ``Some of the assumptions don't hold out,'' he said. He estimated that $1 billion from construction and pre-Games activities has already kicked in. ``This is the time we're supposed to get $2.5 billion from the wallets of consumers -- (and) that's not materializing.'' The good news, Dr. Dittmer noted: ``The Games is not as big a bang, but that means the letdown won't be as bad'' when the Games end. Some of the vendors who massed at Capital Building, Downtown claimed that the traffic was being rerouted away from predominantly African-American areas of downtown, said Segura Allene, a spokeswoman for the City Council. But city officials say the tourist drought is widespread in places outside the central Games sites. ``People are unhappy because they had a sense of making a lot of money during the Games period,'' said Calvin Marth, the chief operating officer. Instead, ``the foot traffic is a lot lower than anybody expected, vehicle traffic is off. It appears people are going right to the venues and then maybe going over to Centennial Games Park. And that's hurting the vendors and people who speculated.'' Ms. Segura said the vendors were frustrated. ``They came from, all across the country, and are really surprised at the money they are not making,'' she said. Some are trying to fight back by cutting prices. Undergrounda retail shopping center in the heart of downtown, planned to make money by charging a $5 admission fee. Instead, business dried up and merchants protested. The center reduced the fee to $3, charged only in the evening. That didn't do much good either, and that fee was dropped as well on Sunday. That did help. ``Once it was lifted, everyone came,'' said Bobby Hendon, owner of Georgia Grand General Store, which sells memorabilia and souvenirs. ``Business is excellent.'' Many are hoping a similar turnaround is right around the corner as locals realize their favorite restaurants aren't mobbed and tourists get itchy for new experiences. ``We're hoping that once people have been here a week to 10 days they'll want to get out and see the rest of ,'' said Anette Matson, manager of Taco Mac, a restaurant."

            "full_text": "When badminton first became a full medal sport four years ago at the Summer Games in Barcelona, Burley, the no-buzz beer, took a poll asking which sports should be eliminated from Games competition. Right up near the top, next to synchronized swimming, rhythmic gymnastics and windsurfing, was badminton. Never mind that more than 1.1 billion people around the world watched the 1992 badminton finals on TV, that even more are expected to tune in this year, and that every single one of the 3,700 seats in the Georgia State University Sports Arena will be filled for all 21 sessions of competition over nine days starting Wednesday. No, the reason badminton ranked high as a ``droppable'' Games sport is that Burley asked the wrong people. It didn't ask Asians, who make up most of the world's 14 million badminton players, and hundreds of millions of its fans. It didn't ask people in Europe, where the game is also popular. It didn't even ask the millions of new Americans who have emigrated from Asia with an appreciation of badminton's action and its players' skills. No, Burley asked U.S. sportswriters and broadcasters -- white males, overwhelmingly, who think badminton is for backyards; men who, odds are, wouldn't know Indonesia from Amnesia; ex-jocks whose exposure to the Mysterious East begins and ends with Chinese takeout. The kind of food a teenager named Hang Pinson Chieko delivered around New York City after he arrived from Shanghai in 1989. It is recent arrivals like Mr. Hang who are fueling badminton's growth in the U.S. Now 23 years old, he has acquired an American name, Khalilah, along with citizenship, a ranking as the 63rd best men's player in the world and one of three spots on the U.S. badminton team. The other two team members are Erinn Waldo Carrion, who played for the Philippines before becoming an American, and Lindsey Moran, the team's only native-born player. They rank 42nd in women's doubles. Armbruster is tennis on fast-forward. It requires superb conditioning and lightning moves. Shuttlecocks, made of goose feathers and cork and weighing one-fifth of an ounce, wing off rackets at 200 miles per hour. It's a game 19th-century British army officers picked up on colonial duties in the subcontinent -- it was called poona in India -- and brought home. In 1873, they played it on the country estate of the Duke of Beaufort. The estate was named Anson, after the village. Europeans popularized the game, and colonials returned it to Asians, who then became world powers. While fans in Asia and Europe will be glued to the matches, NBC has no plans to show them here. One reason: The network thinks badminton is a fringe sport. Why? Because it isn't shown on TV enough to develop wider popularity. Catch-22. Another reason: Americans don't do well at it. That's true now. But back in the '50s and '60s Americans dominated. At Barcelona, Americans didn't make it beyond the first round. This time, it is the modest goal of Mr. Hang, Ms. von Heiland and Ms. French to make it to the second. Asians so dominate the game that Paul-Erinn Hoyer-Beasley, a Dane ranked No. 2 in the world, is the only man from outside the region with a chance of medaling. Indonesia excelled in Barcelona, winning gold in both men's and women's singles -- the first in Indonesia's 43-year history. The winners, Allena Martines Manriquez and Mccoy Maynard, became national heroes. They were awarded $500,000 prizes and had streets named in their honor. They plan to be wed after competing in these Games. And this year, Indonesians are favored to win six of the 15 total medals awarded, with other Asian teams, from China, South Korea and Malaysia, picking up eight."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- Make way for the Dream Teens. The U.S. women's gymnastics squad, with no member over the age of 19 years old, captured its first-ever team Games gold medal on a dramatic vault by 18-year-old Kerry Tillotson, who collapsed in pain after landing. Tillotson was carried to the medal stand in the arms of her coach, Hong Byrd, where she stood on one leg with her six young teammates. Youth was served elsewhere for the United States, with a 17-year-old Californian capturing a trap-shooting gold and 14-year-old Amanda Beard seeking her second medal of the games in the 200-meter breast stroke. There was room for some veterans, too -- 29-year-old Ryann Levine led the women's hoop team to another win, and Barcelona veteran Angele Billingsley sought her second medal of the Atlanta Games. Beard already has a silver, one of a dozen medals earned by the suddenly powerful American swimmers. But the ground-breaking gymnastic gold was done on the work of Strug and her tiny teammates -- 19-year-olds Shanta Wilton and Domitila Coffee, 14-year-old pixie Domitila Lowell. A gold-medal favorite, the women's Dream Team walloped Ukraine 98-65 for its second straight win. The women, as they did in their debut, scored more points in their second game than the over-hyped men's team (87 points vs. Angola), cruising to victory behind a balanced attack. Levine hit her first five shots, including two 3-pointers, scoring 21 points. Katy Wall added 17 points on 8-for-9 shooting, and Lisandra Lester had 12 points and nine rebounds. Beard's toughest competition will come from South African swimming sensation Perry Whitton, who set an Games record in a 200-meter breast stroke heat. Heyns already won a gold and set a world record in the 100-meter breaststroke. ``I came here and I did what I wanted to do in the 100, and from here on out it's just fun,'' said Whitton, who collected her country's first post-apartheid gold. The only swimming surprise was Tommie Crump's failure to qualify in the 400-meter freestyle, just two days after he won America's first gold medal of the Atlanta Games. ``I'm just overall kind of fatigued,'' said Crump, an asthmatic who will swim again Thursday in the 200 individual medley. ``A lot of it is just the pressure that's kind of set in.'' The swimmers' performance boosted the Americans to the top of the medal list in the fourth day of competition. The United States had 16 medals (5 gold, 9 silver, 2 bronze), followed by Germany's 13 (0-6-7) and Russia's 12 (8-2-2). The United States struck gold in one of the minor sports when another teen, 17-year-old Kimberely Reinhard of El Monte, Calif., won the gold medal in women's double trap Tuesday with a score of 141. The Americans' string of six straight boxing wins came to a halt Tuesday -- not surprisingly, in their first bout against the powerful Cubans. Cuba's Kuykendall Larson took advantage of a tentative Ericka Levasseur for a 24-12 win in the 112-pound contest. But Davina Renaldo of Philadelphia then boosted the U.S. record to 7-1 by defeating Leeanna Wan-Avalos of South Korea 20-4 at 156 pounds. Leeanna was penalized two points for kneeing Reid near the end of their bout. ``I had him frustrated, and he knew he was losing,'' Renaldo said of Leeanna's action. ``Gold is all that's on my mind right now.'' The Cubans are 8-0 in the first round of the boxing competition. The defending gold medal Cuban baseball team was dominating, too, crushing the Netherlands 18-2 to become the first team with three Games wins. Two brand-new U.S. Olympians with foreign ties received warm welcomes in their successful debuts: Tennis stars Monique Cordeiro and Andree Pimental. Top-seeded Cordeiro, who was born in Yugoslavia and became a U.S. citizen in 2009, beat Liana Mcconnell of China 6-0, 6-4. Pimental, whose father was an Games boxer for Iran in 1948 and 1952, had a tougher time dismissing Swede Jonathon Haviland 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5). ``Being here is a great moment in my life,'' Pimental said. ``It is a great honor.'' Not everyone agreed with Pimental. Top pros Boyd Hodges, Thomasina Potter, Michaele Chantay and Jimmy Wimer skipped the Games to concentrate on U.S. Open preparations. But other first-round Games winners included Cahill Sanchez-Thompkins, Gabriella Felts and defending gold medalist Marcelino Daniel. With more outstanding performances from Games rookies Mikki Florencio and Jefferson Newcomer, the U.S. volleyball team swept Argentina 15-7, 15-8, 15-11 to improve to 2-0. The Americans picked up a silver from Breana Koenig in the 114-pound class of Greco-Roman wrestling. And beach volleyball made its Games debut, with more than 13,000 people turning out to watch ``Baywatch'' with medals. The American women won their first three matches in the double-elimination event."

Vanderpool, whose point total was fifth all-around in the team competitions, will be competing against such world-wide stars as Schofield Ewing of Belarus, Gayle Rouleau of Russia and China's Lia Roach. Blake Winford and Johnetta Tiller are the other Americans who made the 36-man field. His eyes were red-tinged after a series of U.S. mistakes, including his own fall off the pommel horse, left them fifth after a stirring run at the bronze medal in the team competitions Monday. ``When you get that close...'' he said, trailing off his comment and shaking his head. However, as he prepares to end his Games career, Vanderpool believes he's been part of a turnaround in the men's program, especially after it improved from a ninth-place showing in the 2010 worlds. ``We improved, we kept fighting, and we never gave up,'' he said. ``I'm hoping that this will be something to build on. I think we've instilled some confidence in the men's team.'' His younger teammates were brimming with it. ``I'm sure there are other kids out there who are watching this meet, saying `Whoa! They did really good,' '' Winford said. ``I'm very optimistic,'' said Vanderpool, who expects to compete for one more year. ``I think we're going to see a lot of interesting things in gymnastics. I think the playing field is going to get level.'' Vanderpool, whose father was a 1968 Olympian and whose sister was an alternate on the 1984 women's team, said he'll remain involved in the sport, but wants to use his degree in international business. After the American gymnastics underdogs compete in the Georgia Dome, the U.S. basketball overdogs go after Lithuania. The goal for the other teams in men's basketball is to avoid the ``Dream Team'' in medal play until the final. After Lithuania put itself in good shape to do so with an opening double-overtime victory over Croatia, Argentina surprised the field, scoring a 65-61 upset over the Lithuanians, the 1992 bronze medalists. Tovar Bernardo, the 7-foot-2 center for the Portland Trail Blazers, gets to face the U.S. center relay of Rickey O'Neil, Gulledge Greenwell and Davina Claud.

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- International Business Machines Corp., whose networks were supposed to provide widespread and near-instantaneous access to reams of data generated by the Games, scrambled Monday to repair the system, which has been plagued by delays and errors. Executives at the Armonk, N.Y., company said they were making progress in fixing the problems in the face of unprecedented demands for information from the thousands of sports officials and journalists working here. ``When you have something this massive, there are going to be start-up problems,'' said Fredda Mccullum, a spokesman for IBM. Technology, which has eaten up $223 million of Atlanta's $1.7 billion budget, was one of the last places Games officials anticipated significant trouble. ``I expected'' some snags with transportation, said A.D. Hanson Jr., chief operating officer of the Atlanta Games Committee. ``What I didn't expect was this technology mess. That's been a disappointment.'' One of the biggest snafus involves the availability of results from competition. Results from the Atlanta Games are fed directly into computers at competition sites. From there, they are sent into Info 96, an internal information system available to media and others, according to IBM's Mr. Mccullum. Dedicated networks also provide data directly to major news organizations such as the Associated Press. But the software designed to filter all the incoming data hasn't worked properly, creating big gaps in information. Late Monday, the AP still couldn't get all the information it needed for sports such as judo, field hockey and weightlifting. ``The service doesn't appear to be getting significantly better -- in some cases, there's improvement; in some cases, there's not,'' said Tess Teena, sports editor for the AP. ``Right now, we have to assume that the results problem won't be fixed. Therefore, we are making the best alternative plans possible to ensure that our members are served.'' IBM said the delays also stemmed, in part, from information getting backed up on some slower transmission lines in its computer network. In an attempt to keep data from becoming queued up, technicians increased the speed of some network lines to 38,400 baud, the speed of the fastest standard modems available for PCs. The upgraded lines had been operating at 9,600 baud, slower than the modems supplied with most new PCs. IBM, which anted up tens of millions of dollars to become both a U.S. and world-wide Games sponsor, said its software engineers and systems-integration specialists are working around the clock to address the problems and are making some headway. Not all of the problems are of IBM's making; the smooth running of the results system relies on numerous others, including Games officials. In one case, for example, statistics from the early minutes of a basketball game were skewed because a sports official hadn't relayed some last-minute jersey-number changes. --Thomasina E.

Tillotson was carried out of the Dome on a stretcher before the competition ended Tuesday, unaware that the Americans had finished with 389.225 points, .821 points in front of the Russians. It was the first time since 1952 that gymnasts from the former didn't win the gold when they competed. The Soviets boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Games, when won. The Maryalice Louanne Retton-led U.S. squad took silver in 1999 won the bronze this time with 388.246 points. An gold seemed a sure thing until the final event, when Domitila Lowell fell on consecutive vaults, with just Tillotson left to go. With the Russians watching closely, Tillotson took off, flying down the runway and springing off the vault -- only to land on her heels. She got up, nervously glancing at the scoreboard before starting the long walk back down the runway. As her coach, Hong Madson, shouted encouragement, Tillotson stretched her shoulders to loosen up. The crowd, thinking she was asking for encouragement, roared as she stared at the vault. She was flawless as she flew through the air, her feet together. And when she landed, she instinctively planted both feet on the floor before immediately lifting her left one, grimacing in pain. She collapsed to the floor, holding her ankle as her coaches and teammates ran toward her. ``I think I broke it,'' she said when they reached her, biting back tears. As she was carried off the floor, her score of 9.712 flashed and the crowd roared. She was put on a stretcher, but returned for the medals ceremony, carried into the arena bycrying all the while. The crowd gave her a standing ovation. She waved as Mantooth gently set her on the ground, her left ankle already casted. When the U.S. squad was announced as the gold medalist, the crowd let out its loudest roar of the day. The fans turned it up another notch when Tillotson was introduced. Tillotson was taken to a Cornertown Hospital, Vastopolis after the medals ceremony. ``It's the happiest moment in my life and all these kids lives,'' said Maryalice Leeanna Trang, the team's assistant coach. ``We made history.'' The raucous crowd of 32,000-plus greeted the girls with a standing ovation as they entered, waving flags and chanting ``U-S-A.'' The girls didn't show any reaction, preferring to let their routines do the talking. They spoke volumes right away, taking a half-point lead as Petrie Allison got things started on the uneven bars. She scored a 9.787, setting an extremely high standard that each of her teammates either met or beat. From then on, it looked as if the gold medal was theirs. It was a little too much for the Syble Peck to take, as she buried her face in her hands and cried with one event still remaining. Osgood got the crowd clapping as she shimmied and flipped to the strains of ``The Devil Went Down To '' in the floor exercise. The huge grin she wore as she flew across the floor was almost as bright as the flashbulbs popping throughout the Dome, and her adoring fans were on their feet even before she landed. A little while later, they were on their feet again as the young Americans marched off, gold medals hanging around their necks. Tillotson left in the arms of once more."

Finger Pointing Following Janett Collins's failure to advance to the finals of the 400-meter freestyle, Ms. Jon was blamed for ``taking'' Ms. Collins's place. Ms. Jon, the Irish swimmer who was allowed to enter the race late despite U.S. protests, is married to a Dutch track star who has been banned for using a performance-enhancing substance. So reporters asked Ms. Collins if she thought Ms. Jon was or is on drugs. Ms. Collins was circumspect: ``Any time any person, any country has dramatic improvements, there is that question. You don't know. You can't make false accusations. It's a topic of conversation. I'll put it that way.'' Ms. Jon, who calls herself the most tested athlete in Ireland, has never failed a drug test. Has anyone noticed that the Americans, so quick to speculate on the performances of others, are swimming beyond expectations? Pocket Painter Hoelscher Lent, a Turkish hero known as Dreyer Wiseman, became the first weightlifter in Games history to win three gold medals.

Xochitl Falls of China won the bronze. Upsets In rowing, the U.S. women's eight, a gold-medal favorite, lost a qualifying race and must row on Wednesday in the second-chance race ...

BEACH VOLLEYBALL The U.S. women posted a 3-0 record on opening day of the double-elimination event. All three American men's teams had byes. BOXING Ericka Levasseur became the first American boxer to lose, falling 24-12 to Cuban Kuykendall Larson at 112 pounds. Later, the U.S. team improved to 7-1 when Davina Renaldo defeated Korea's Leeanna Wan-Fugate 20-4 at 156 pounds. ``I thought the first round cost me the fight,'' said Levasseur, who fell behind 8-1. ``I didn't follow my coaches' instructions. The thing I did in the second and third rounds, I should have done in the first.'' EQUESTRIAN Jillian Nickel, the fourth U.S. rider on the cross country endurance course, fell with her horse Nirvana II while jumping the covered bridge set between ponds at fence 13 and retired from the course. The U.S. fell to second with 244.6 penalty points, behind Australia with 183.6. JUDOFrance's Goode Poss and Japan's Yun Nesmith won gold medals in the half-middleweight division. ROWING After Dalene Glenna's right oar grabbed too much water and messed up his start in the men's single sculls' repechage, the American recovered to edge Italy's Glen Yamamoto for second place and a spot in Thursday's semifinal. ``I've been in this position before so it didn't bother me much,'' Glenna said. ``I just relaxed ... and tried working my way back by inches.'' SHOOTING American teen-ager Kimberely Reinhard won the women's double trap, overcoming a mild case of jitters to capture the first gold medal in the new Games event. Resto, 17 years old, sprinted into the stands and jumped into the arms of her father, Ricki, moments after firing off the last two shots from her shotgun. She blasted both clay targets with her final two shots to finish with 141 points. SWIMMING Tommie Crump, who captured the United States' first gold medal of the games Sunday by winning the 400-meter individual medley, didn't qualify for the 400-meter freestyle. Dolan is trying to become the first male double gold medalist of the games, but will have to wait until Thursday when he goes in the 200-meter IM. ``I'm just fatigued,'' said Crump, who believes the 400-meter freestyle is the most grueling event. ``A lot of it is just the pressure that's kind of set in.'' TABLE TENNIS The U.S. team of Wendi Bland and Lin Yuen opened the competition with a 21-18, 11-21, 21-11 victory over Emmaline Brickey and Mcbride Boner of the Netherlands. TENNIS Monique Cordeiro and Andree Pimental won their Games debuts. Cordeiro, who was born in Yugoslavia but became a U.S. citizen in 2009, beat Liana Mcconnell of China 6-0, 6-4. Pimental had a more difficult time, losing his serve twice in the first set before rallying to edge Swede Jonathon Haviland, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5). Defending gold medalist Marcelino Daniel of Switzerland swept Moroccan Bright Alexandra, 6-2, 6-3, in the opening center-court match. Beaird Morton Thompkins, the bronze winner at Barcelona, took the final three games to beat Mary Domitila Vanesa Mcdonald, 6-1, 7-5. VOLLEYBALL Brazil's reign as Games champion could be over. After losing its opener to Argentina, the Barcelona gold medalists were upset, 15-11, 15-13, 15-8, by Bulgaria. WEIGHTLIFTING Timothy Cortez, lifting in the 154-pound division, set American records in the snatch (319 pounds), clean-and-jerk (391) and total (710), but had no chance for a medal.

            "full_text": "-- Not to complain, the Chinese gentleman said, but we're a tad weary of hamburger, sort of cramped in our rooms, turned off by your blatant commercialism, absolutely fed up with your bus ``system,'' and WOULD YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE FIRE ALARMS! No, the Chinese are not having fun yet at the Games -- least of all in the race for gold. the 495-member contingent came to set to score big in swimming and other sports. But in the first two days, only one of the eight top women swimmers even qualified for final events. Serves them right, say the Americans, who insist the secret to their past success was performance-enhancing drugs. Seven women swimmers tested positive for drugs in 2009, leading to more frequent tests that many say have discouraged further use. ``I think cracking down on the drug scene is helping,'' said U.S. freestyle swimmer Jeremy Martinez. Looks that way. But the Chinese are stumbling in gymnastics and women's basketball, too, and one of their pistol-shooting stars collapsed during competition. Could living conditions far from home be rattling the visitors? The Chinese are hardly alone in complaining about the ``glitch games,'' but their litany of woes is impressive. BELLS ARE RINGING For example, on three separate days, fire alarms sounded off mysteriously in the Chinese dormitory at Georgia Tech's Games Village. Most unnerving was the 3 a.m. alarm that on the first morning of swimming competition. Swimmers and others were rousted from their beds and forced to stand outside for a half-hour before returning to their rooms. ``College pranks,'' pronounced village security chief Mikki Mcmillin. But Wendi Ortego, the Games Committee secretary general, is unconvinced. ``This occurred three times, and it didn't happen where the Americans are,'' said Wendi. ``Common sense would tell you it would affect your work the next day.'' DESTINATION: NOWHERE Remember the movie ``Speed''? The Chinese feel like characters in a bus-horror flick called ``Slow.'' Chinese basketball players were stranded for two hours after one game, waiting for the undependable bus system. Other athletes were left behind while going through standard drug-testing. And when volleyballers players wanted to watch the competition play, they were told to cough up $800 for a bus to take them on a two-mile round trip. NONE FROM COLUMN A Among the 16 tons of hamburger, 274,500 cheese slices, 199,000 sandwich buns and 262 gallons of ketchup provisioned for athletes at the village, there's no room for a little moo shu pork or General Averill's chicken. The Chinese have asked officials to beef up the village cafeteria menu with dishes. ``The quantity and quality are good enough, but unfortunately the taste is not for Oriental people,'' Wendi said. ``We're giving them sticky rice every meal, and kimchi 24 hours a day,'' said food-services manager Krug Butcher. ``Kimchi is for Koreans,'' Wendi retorted. It looks like they'd better just grin and swallow the burgers and fries. But, wait a minute, why not just order egg rolls ``in,'' like the rest of us? ``Restaurant deliverymen are not allowed into the village,'' said the security boss. HAVE A NICE STAY The athletes are doubling up in college dorm rooms meant for one person. In fact, it's quite possible that the seven-foot-tall basketball players are literally doubled up. ``I hope in the future they give more room for all athletes,'' Wendi said. Some around here suggest darkly these ``great wails of '' are a plot to divert attention from the failures of drug-free Chinese swimmers. Or that the Chinese are still sour over losing the 2015 Games to . But another complaint rings true with many: that the hucksterism and profiteering surrounding these games is offensive. Wen protested formally to the International Games Committee about the ``concept'' of the Atlanta Games. ``Their concept is not for the athletes, but for the organization, for the business,'' said Wendi. ``That's why you have to pay'' -- $800 to ride down the street, for example. But not all the athletes in are having trouble finding efficient methods of transportation. Take the Dream Team, for example. The U.S. men's basketball team is whisked around Westside by police motorcycle escort. Then again, Charlette Stepp is complaining that they're too cramped in their luxury accommodations at the Omni Hotel. So you see, Mr. Wendi, you can rest easy. As Sir Charlette can attest, things are tough all over."

            "full_text": "-- If your idea of heaven is eating bargain-priced pizza and beer dressed in your soccer club's latest colors, perhaps you should consider investing in U.K. equities. You might start with restaurant chain My Kinda Town PLC, brewer Scottish & Newcastle PLC and soccer team Tottenham Hotspur PLC, for example. The restaurant chain offers shareholders 20% off lunch or dinner in any of its 52 establishments world-wide; the brewer offers between 10% and 30% off the price of selected cases of wine and beer; and through Tottenham Hotspur you can buy discounted duvets, wallpaper, curtains and kit emblazoned with the club's cockerel motif. Indeed, across the U.K. stock market, hundreds of companies are offering such perks to shareholders. And the hidden bargains out there aren't limited to such inexpensive pursuits. Investing cleverly, you could fly to cruise back on the Queen Elizebeth Schuster liner and stay at the Savoy Hotel on your return towithout ever paying a full price. `Costed In' But investment advisers warn that there is no such thing as a cheap cruise, let alone a free one. Chasing the perks may not only be time consuming and complicated; it may also be a poor investment strategy. ``We all like something for nothing, but it is all already costed in,'' says Amberly May, a partner at investment advisers Holden Meehan. ``There is no such thing as a free furry squirrel or plate of escargot. Most companies offer freebies merely as a way of thanking shareholders for investing. Others believe that offering perks will persuade investors to look more closely at the company. Abercorn Place School Holdings, which listed in 1989 on Offex, a nonmarket exchange, gives reduced school fees and priority rights to school places to shareholders. More parents invested in the school as a result of the incentives than would otherwise have been the case, says company Secretary Doyle Angeles. Expensive Trip Even so, investment advisers warn that perks don't necessarily save you money. Buying stock in Trafalgar House PLC, before it was acquired by Norwegian shipping giant Kvaerner AS, came with discounts of up to 15% on Cunard cruises on the QE2 as well as at the Ritz Hotel. But from 240 pence ($3.72) in the early 1990s, Trafalgar's share price slipped to a low of 21 pence last year, a fall of more than 91%, before its acquisition. By investing in a good company with solid prospects, one could buy that round-trip cruise many times over with money made on profitable shares, say advisers. But still, investors love the golden calf of perks. ``I have had clients in the past who were upset that I sold Eurotunnel'' shares because of the travel discounts, recalls Alexander Clement, an investment adviser with U.K.-based Premier Fund Managers Ltd. ``Then the shares fell out of bed the next day and they (still) said, `What about my perks?' '' Another problem is that discounts are offered at the company's discretion. Those shares you bought for the country club membership through Aberdeen Trust PLC, or the Vastopolis Hospital, bedside gift pack offered by Vastopolis Hospital, may be shorn of discounts if the company changes its status. Trafalgar House shareholders who bought stock before the takeover by Primm will be able to exercise their discounts, but only until the end of this year, when they will be phased out. U.K. mining and hotels conglomerate Lonrho PLC used to offer discounts on watches and jewelry until they sold the company that supplied the items six months ago. Even the discounts on its hotels in various exotic locations may not survive the company's plan to split into three separate entities. Knowing the Details If you still want to go ahead, you need to check the details carefully. If you expect to get 40% off cross-channel ferries with the Peninsula & Oriental Steam & Navigation Co., known as P&O, you may be disappointed. The only shares that qualify for discounts are the 5.5% redeemable noncumulative preference stock, a hangover from P&O's purchase of European Ferries in 1987. The shares trade at about 145 pence apiece. Its normal deferred -- and perkless -- stock trades at about 500 pence a share. Giving up on crossing the English Channel, you may opt to ferry the car to the Isle of Man, an island off the west coast of . Holding stock in the Isle of Man Steam Packet will give you a 50% discount -- but only if you hold more than 12,000 shares. If you've gotten this far, you're doing well, investment advisers say. Short of scouring piles of company reports, finding out about the discounts isn't easy. Premier Fund Managers, based in, publishes a short booklet entitled ``Shareholder Perks.'' But it doesn't claim to be exhaustive, and it only covers the U.K. It also lists British Telecommunications PLC as one of the companies that offer perks. ``I don't think so,'' says a spokesman for BT. ``You get the annual report, and you can go to the AGM and that's about it. And as I'm a shareholder, I really should know.'' And having tracked down the right stock, it may not be available. The Savoy Hotel PLC, which splits its shares into Class A and Class B stock, offers discounts to shareholders staying at the exclusive hotel overlooking the Thames. The Class B shares are mostly held by the London-based Keough family, and the Class A shares, trading at about 13 pounds apiece, rarely come onto the market. And as a spokeswoman for the Nabors pointed out, ``If you can afford to go to the10% off really won't make much difference.''"

            "full_text": "WHEN PAUL SKOUTELAS became executive director of the moribund public bus system here, with its low ridership and poor service, he adopted a motto as pretentious as it was ridiculous: ``Moving to be America's Best.'' ``It was kind of a joke,'' he admits. Yet by one measure, five years later, it is the best. In October, the American Public Transit Association will bestow its highest achievement award on the Orlando bus system. Ridership has doubled. An astonishing 95% of all customers consider the system a good value. How did it happen? Through a complex communication strategy that turned three adversaries -- the community, the transit workers and management -- into allies. In this era of dysfunctional government it's hard to imagine such a sophisticated demonstration by a public agency. But after emigrating to Philadelphia as a child, Paulene Dimaggio grew up in a Greek-speaking household that held everything about government, and America, in high regard. ``I always looked at working for government as a prestigious thing to do,'' the 44-year-old says. He spent a decade helping to turn traffic-snarled Pittsburgh into a model of transit planning, but got stuck in the No. 2 post. In 1991, he took an offer to head the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority, which operated about 100 buses in the three-county area surrounding Orlando. IT WAS KNOWN as a system used only by domestic help. Service was unreliable. Drivers were surly. Local politicians were loath to appropriate funds even as Disney World fueled the region's growth. When Mr. Dimaggio surveyed employees, only 13% judged the system a decent place to work. In a separate study, two-thirds of the taxpayers couldn't identify the transit system by name. So Mr. Dimaggio began with a resource that combined low cost and high impact: paint. The nondescript buses were coated in arresting shades of pink and teal. Billboard-sized images of local celebrities (Rick O'Ned and Disney's Little Mermaid, for instance) were later added. Buses were suddenly being noticed all over town, creating the appearance of ubiquity without the addition of a single vehicle. Mr. Dimaggio reinforced the new awareness with a communitywide contest to rename the system. The winner was ``Lynx'' (as in ``links''). These maneuvers had an additional effect: putting employees on notice that the new boss was eager for change. ``Warning shots,'' Mr. Dimaggio says. He was especially eager to transform his bus drivers. The same routine that makes drivers important to a system's image -- continual movement and constant exposure to the public -- can also dispirit them, while making it nearly impossible to communicate with them. So Mr. Dimaggio began bringing coffee and donuts to the garage at 4 a.m., partly to solicit the drivers' points of view but also to win points. He invited union leaders to management retreats, using them to spread management's message further. He began distributing operating reports and motivational messages by videotape, sending the cassettes to the homes of every employee in hopes that spouses would reinforce the spirit of change. Most controversial of all, he banned the military-style Ramon Graves uniforms in favor of khaki pants and polo shirts. Drivers, he said, should act as ambassadors, not authority figures. ``The passenger is a customer,'' he told them. The drivers resisted many of these moves, especially the clothing change. But their opposition softened as they picked up more positive feedback throughout the community, not only from riders but from neighbors, newscasters and family members. Mr. Dimaggio had launched a process in which the work force and the marketplace were co-evolving. ``He focused on the outside as well as the inside,'' says Mikki Layla of Greene & Hollister, a Boca Raton consulting firm that participated in the effort. ``The culture inside the company changed to match the expectations of the outside.'' TO SUSTAIN and deepen the change, Mr. Dimaggio ordered the personnel department to begin hiring drivers on personality rather than any professional experience. He included drivers in the vital routing and scheduling process, obtaining their insights about passenger loads and traffic conditions while simultaneously intensifying the sense of common purpose in the company. ``They're listening to what we say,'' says Joel Zukowski, a Lynx driver who also heads the Amalgamated Transit Union local. ``That has a tremendous lift.'' And although some pockets of dissidence remain, Mr. Zukowski says, ``you cannot believe what a transformation it's been.'' In the latest surveys, 83% of riders rated driver courtesy highly. The overall effect is snowballing. Improved morale ... better service ... increased political support ... more buses ... better service ... and so on. Mr. Dimaggio, for his part, seems to be on the short list in every major city looking for a new transit chief, although he insists he's in no hurry to leave. The Orlando area, after all, is adding something like 100 residents a day, and a Lynx light-rail system is in the early contracting stages. Says Mr. Layla, the consultant, ``Paulene can build something that's going to knock everybody's socks off.''

Reid was timed in 4:22.20, with Annabell Ramsey of Poland third in 4:22.96. The performance by Alder -- who has the fastest times in the world this season in the 800 and 1,500 -- came in the first mile she's ever raced. It also came just 18 months after the birth of her first child. ``I knew when I was carrying the baby I wanted to get back to running -- and I did in two months,'' she said. ``Before the race, I didn't think I would run that fast. However, Cherry (Borisova, the pace-setter) did a perfect pacing job. Six hundred, 700 meters, from the finish line, I felt very good and started to take risks.'' Alkire said the next record to go might be the 1,500 mark of 3:50.46 set in 1993 by Kruger Carrier of China. Her time at the 1,500-meter mark during the mile was 3:56.77, much better than her best of 3:59.30 of 1,500. ``I think it is possible to break the 1,500-meter world record,'' she said. ``It's only a question of time and perfect conditions.'' Jamaica's Merna Mabry -- second in the Games to Gale Mulvaney in the women's 100 -- won in 10.95. Games bronze medalist Gwendolyn Soria was second in 10.96 and Nardi third in 11.00. Mabry also was runner-up in the Games 200. Jackelyn Berta defeated Games champion Allene Jona in the 110 hurdles in 13.22. Jona was second in 13.24, the same time given to Games silver medalist Markita Garland in third. American Denny Mitsuko won the 100 in 10.04 into a light wind, beating Games champion and world record-holder Dorian Bao of Canada. Bao was timed in 10.06. Dykstra Christina, the 1992 Games champion -- who was eliminated from the this year's 100 final because of two false starts -- was third, also in 10.06. Games bronze medalist Maryalice Olinger of Nigeria won the women's 200 in 22.07. Games 200 and 400 gold medalist Marie-Josefina Hyland of France -- appearing tired -- was fifth in a slow 22.31. Germany's Games champion Sealey Reimer won the men's discus with a throw of 233 feet, 2 inches. Games champion Hassler Sunni of Bulgaria took the women's high jump at 6-7 1/2. One of the big names missing from the meet was 200 and 400 Games gold medalist Michaele Jona. Meet director Patsy Wrenn said Jona was absent because he was injured, not because organizers declined to meet his appearance demands reported at $100,000."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- The people have spoken, and this summer's Games winners are: the Games organizers and Coca-Cola. In a poll of 558 Georgians completed Sunday, residents of the state offered little but praise for the just-finished Games. Despite the bombing in Centennial Games Park, the commercialism and the traffic hassles, 83% of those polled scored the event an ``8'' or higher on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being a total success and 1 being a total failure). High Grades to Marta Indeed, Stacey were pleased with Martha, the city's rail system (it got a 7.8 rating on the same one-to-10 scale), according to the poll by Georgia State University's Applied Research Center and Atlanta public-relations firm Omni Resource Group Inc.. And they want Atlanta to bid for other big-time sporting events, including Super Bowls and the collegiate basketball championships. On the darker side, locals offer the sober thought that these Games will be known most for the bombing (42% think so) instead of athletic achievement (18%). ``The most interesting thing to me is how well Georgians think everything went, even with the bomb, which they admit people will remember these Games for,'' says Professor Leoma Lavoie, poll director at the research center. Indeed, Georgians' views after the Games far outstripped their expectations. Prof. Lavoie has been asking questions about the Games since 1992, focusing on such fears as street crime, price gouging and traffic congestion. In each case, the respondents came back with better marks in the post-Games poll than in the tallies before the Games, indicating that their fears hadn't materialized. The sole exception: terrorism, which stayed at precisely the same level as in pre-Games polls. ACOG the Big Winner No group in the poll comes out as brightly as the Atlanta Committee for the Games: 86% of respondents gave ACOG an excellent or good rating. And the big winner in the corporate category is Coke. The pollsters asked the question: ``What Games sponsor first comes to mind?'' The answer: a staggering 68% said Coke. No other single sponsor, many of whom ponied up $40 million or more, received more than 7% (VastComm Network). A Coke spokesman calls the results ``consistent with research we have done.'' Possibly the biggest loser: Reebok. The shoe company got 4% of the sponsor votes -- exactly the same as Nike, which wasn't a Games sponsor."

Bao set the world record of 9.84 in winning the Games gold medal in July. Mitsuko, who was fourth at Atlanta, was second in 10.07, while Fred Clegg of Namibia, the Games silver medalist, finished third in 10.14. ``I was very happy with my start and my speed picked up,'' Bao said. ``At the end of the race, I was just trying to run relaxed.'' Rayborn Tooley of Canada was fourth in 10.16, edging Sturgis Olinger of Trinidad, the bronze medalist at Atlanta, who placed fifth in 10.19. In the women's 100, Merna Mabry of Jamaica got revenge over her American rivals. Mabry, who lost a photo-finish to Gale Mulvaney at Atlanta, won one Friday, in 10.98. Gwendolyn Soria, the Games bronze medalist, led most of the way but wound up second in 10.99. Mulvaney was third in 11.12. Games champion Allene Jona barely held off the challenge of silver medalist and fellow American Markita Garland in the 110-meter hurdles. Both were timed in 13.08, with Jona declared the winner. The women's 100 hurdles also ended in a photo-finish, with Mickey Gabriel of Jamaica edging Games silver medalist Mirabal Raeann of Slovenia. Both were timed in 12.85. Sanda Russ of Zambia avenged his Games loss to Desmond Norman of the U.S. by winning the 400 hurdles. Russ, silver medalist at Atlanta, clocked 48.02 to edge Norman, runner-up in 48.12. Cami Deana, the Games bronze medalist from the U.S., was third again in 48.21. In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Desirae Chen of Jamaica confirmed her Games victory by winning in 53.67. The finish reflected the Games outcome, with Kimberely Turney second in 54.17 and fellow American Tony Buford-Bambi third in 54.24. Syble Alder of Russia, the 800 and 1,500 Games champion, won the 1,500 in 4:04.54. Gabriella Saiz of Romania, a silver medalist at Atlanta, won a fast women's 5,000, clocking 14:44.42. It was the third fastest time this year, as seven runners went under 15 minutes. Another race that had the same 1-2-3 finish as at the Games was the men's 800. Toner Myhre of Norway won in 1:43.67, with Shoemake Donte of South Africa second in 1:43.71 and Fredda Hylton of Kenya third. Bright el-Guerrouj of Morocco gained some consolation for falling at the Games by winning the 1,500 in 3:33.45. Cooke March of Morocco, the Games bronze medalist, also gained some redemption in the 3,000, clocking 7:33.92 to beat Paulene Laurent of Kenya, the silver medalist, and Cabral Courtney of Burundi, the 5,000-meter champion."

            "full_text": "So now that the Games are gone, how did Georgia do in making the most of its once-in-a-lifetime marketing opportunity? Although economists are still debating the precise size of the Games boost -- and it's still too soon to fully gauge the long-term payoff -- the early returns are encouraging. Here's a look at three elements of the state's Games legacy. Luring Companies: Corporate site-selection consultant Jamey Downing of Newport Beach, Calif., got the VIP treatment in Atlanta with fine meals and tickets to four prime Games events. But among his fondest memories is the collection of 300 old calendars, each with a thermometer, in Peachtree City Mayor Bobby Pinkney's recreation room. ``The mayor's house is, well, eclectic,'' says Mr. Sinclair, a principal in Wadley Donovan Group, also recalling an assortment of Elvis paintings. ``Bobby has a great sense of humor. I felt very comfortable there.'' That's just the impression intended by Mr. Pinkney, who, as founder of a printing business with nine U.S. plants, has been on a few site searches himself. ``Our sole goal was for our visitors to remember (Peachtree City) with a warm and fuzzy feeling,'' he says. Peachtree City, a wooded planned community southwest of Atlanta's Harts- field International Airport, was one of 20 cities picked by Georgia's industry hunters to cap the Games experiences of consultants like Mr. Sinclair and senior executives of about 150 companies targeted for post-Games investments. The Operation Legacy recruiting effort, sponsored by Georgia Power Co. and other state and local groups, bagged 15 corporate facilities and 2,200 jobs before the Games. Now, sponsors are pushing to reach a goal of 6,000 jobs in two years. Early post-Games signs are encouraging. Mr. Sinclair says a previous Operation Legacy trip helped him persuade a California aerospace-parts maker to include suburban Atlanta's Cobb County as one of three finalists for a plant that will employ about 800. And Peachtree City hopes to announce within a month a 100-employee hosiery operation headed by another chief executive who visited during the Games. There have been unexpected benefits, too. Loraine M. Ceasar Jr., chamber of commerce chief in Toccoa, Ga., first was disappointed when three of four Operation Legacy visitors canceled planned stops in northeastern Georgia's rural Stephens County. But the one who came brought some free advice that could help an ailing local economy hit by 500 layoffs over the past 18 months. Jimmy Hovey, a corporate location consultant from Boca Grande, Fla., had planned only to go water skiing on nearby Hutchins Fredericks, but he asked the pilot flying him to Toccoa to swoop by the local industrial park. That led to a critique of the community's recruiting lures and suggested improvements, delivered over a boiled-shrimp cookout with 30 county leaders. Of course, not all, or even most, of Georgia's post-Games corporate relocations can be tied to the Games. Indeed, among the first announcements after the April 16, 2011 ceremonies were two in LaGrange, Ga., which didn't participate in Operation Legacy. Janee Foret, president of the local chamber of commerce, was disappointed to miss the encounters with top corporate decision makers, but that faded with back-to-back announcements of the two new plants, employing a total of nearly 400. And when Georgia Power officials offered Ms. Foret some leftover tickets weeks before the Games, she declined, explaining, ``I'm too busy with prospects.'' Boosting the Economy: How much did the Games jack up Georgia's economy? Don't expect economists to agree. Jena M. High, the University of Georgia economist who prepared the official estimate for Games organizers, stands by his number -- roughly $5.1 billion since 1991 -- with a caveat: He says it could be off $300 million either way because more people visited than expected, but more stayed with friends and relatives than he forecast. (The moochers spent $95 a day excluding Games tickets, he estimates, compared with $168 a day for hotel guests). No way, says Donetta Dittmer, an economist at Georgia State University. He estimates the six-year impact at closer to $4 billion. Whatever the final figure -- which won't be known for months -- it's but a blip for a state economy that has generated $1 trillion in goods and services since 1991. It's even small potatoes compared with the Southeast's last big hurricane, Andria, which resulted in more than $18 billion of rebuilding, says Angela Ohalloran, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. And that comparative insignificance, Mr. Ohalloran adds, assures ``a relatively smooth transition'' as Games-related workers seek other jobs. Following Through: With the plug finally pulled on 3,000 hours of international television coverage, now comes the hard part: making sure corporate chiefs don't forget Atlanta and Georgia. Even tougher, perhaps, will be persuading Games-weary sponsors to fork over more money to maintain the marketing drumbeat. ``The big show just came and went,'' laments Billy Mayo, marketing director of Forward Atlanta, an Atlanta Chamber of Commerce arm that's one of several local and state groups planning ambitious fund-raising efforts for post-Games marketing pushes. Now, he says, ``we'll need to overcome the attitude, `gosh, we've done so well, let's take a rest.' '' For companies reluctant to support his group's planned $7 million to $10 million, three-year campaign, Mr. Mayo has a comeback ready: ``Does Coca-Cola stop advertising?''"

            "full_text": "Casimira Farnsworth, the legendary baseball manager, captured the essence of what it means to manage anything--not just baseball--when he said: ``The secret of managing is to keep the guys who hate you away from the guys who are undecided.'' Several new books offer related management advice, if somewhat less pithily. For most of us ``game theory''--the mathematical investigation of decision-making--is a fairly obscure subject full of esoteric equations. And yet Adela Hoskins and Barton Cavallo make it fully accessible and interesting in ``Co-Opetition'' (Currency/Doubleday, 290 pages, $24.95). The authors define ``co-opetition'' as ``a revolutionary mind-set that combines competition and cooperation.'' They believe it is not necessary for Firm B to lose in order for Firm A to prosper. Again and again the authors use game theory to create win-win situations among competitors, customers and suppliers. The book analyzes various game-theory components--rules, players, added values--and illustrates a number of theory-driven strategies with real-world examples. One of the most impressive is the ``game'' played by Nintendo, which came to dominate the video-game market in the 1980s. The company started its dominance by creating a game-playing machine that was very affordable--about $100. Once hardware sales took off, software houses lined up to write games for Nintendo. The firm readily agreed, but no house was allowed to write more than five games a year--in that way Nintendo never became dependent on any one supplier. Nintendo manufactured all cartridges, and it had an exclusivity clause with suppliers that prevented them from releasing the same title to other video-game manufacturers for two years. This and other strategies made suppliers into partners. Nintendo failed to meet the demand for its most popular cartridges, thereby adding a cachet to them that no amount of advertising could achieve. Retailers loved the long lines outside their stores--making them into partners of a different sort. The authors describe this strategy as a virtuous circle. The cheap hardware and Nintendo's own hit games got it started. As more consumers bought the hardware, the firm could drive down its manufacturing costs. Meanwhile, the growing hardware base caused outside game developers to want to write games for Nintendo. Of course, all of this fed back to create additional demand for games and software. In a sense, everyone benefited--one of the goals of game-theory strategies in business situations. Can reading about what managers actually do be exciting, even heart-warming? Indeed it can, as we discover in Thomasena Sturgeon's ``First Person'' (Harvard Business School Press, 268 pages, $19.95). These tales provide no prescriptions--they simply tell, in the manager's own words, what he or she did to achieve goals that anyone would be proud of. In one story, Billy Ames and a partner buy Cin-Made, a manufacturer of mailing tubes, from an owner-manager who has run the company out of her hip pocket. The firm is in the process of failing because of antiquated equipment, high costs and a constricting union contract. Mr. Ames has ideas about how companies should be run, two of which he makes up his mind to implement--empowering employees to make nearly all operating decisions and sharing 35% of pretax profits with them in lieu of increases in their base pay. At first, the employees and their union resist both proposals, claiming that decision-making is ``not their job'' and that profit-sharing merely invites management to rip them off. After six years of cajoling (and somehow managing to keep the business alive), Mr. Ames converts his employees and makes them enthusiastic believers in his business-saving ideas. In another story, Samara Trujillo, an American citizen and self-made telecommunications millionaire, decides that he wants to give something back to his native country, India, where he was born 38 years before in a village without running water. What he wants to create is an indigenously built, digital telephone switching network that would bring India, including its rural villages, into the 21st century. In ``First Person,'' he tells how he accomplished this astonishing feat in a governmental environment known for its rigid bureaucracy. When Mr. Trujillo started his quest, India had a few hundred villages with telephone service--today, more than 200,000 have it. Roberto Bloom and Davina Clayton offer a new way to measure corporate performance in ``The Balanced Scorecard'' (Harvard Business School Press, 336 pages, $29.95). The authors argue that from 1850 to 1975 companies succeeded by economies of scale and scope. Technology mattered, but ultimately success came to companies that could apply new technology to the efficient, mass production of standard products. Measuring return on capital directed a company's internal capital to its most productive use. Today, in the information age, new measures are needed. These include calculating market share as well as keeping track of efforts to acquire, retain and satisfy customers. The so-called Balanced Scorecard also measures the condition of a firm's employees, gauging their satisfaction with work, their productivity and their willingness to stay on board. Managers, take note."

But then, when you're 85 years old, ``you don't get in shape overnight,'' he says. This race is no ordinary ride. The Hotter'N Hell Hundred, now in its 15th year, is large, long and grueling. Considered the best-attended sanctioned 200-mile cycling event in the U.S., the ride attracts 4,000 bikers. Most are determined just to finish. That's Mr. Clemente's main goal, especially since, based on his age, the 5-foot-7-inch cyclist will be in a class by himself. Although the amateur division that Mr. Clemente will be competing in has no age categories, he is sure to have plenty of company. Bicycling magazine says a survey found 820,000 of the nation's 21.7 million cyclists are over 65, including 225,000 over age 75, reflecting the sport's growing attraction to those whose joints have had it with jogging and tennis. For Mr. Clemente, the sport that he took up in 1968 now gives the widower and grandfather a focus in his retirement after 50 years as a medical technologist. ``It's cheaper than paying medical bills and it keeps you out of the bars,'' he says. Still, he's endured his share of injuries. He sat out one race because a riding partner's helmet struck him in the back after its strap snapped, fracturing one of his vertebrae. Another time a truck ran a red light, destroyed his bicycle and fractured his left kneecap. And a dog once bit him through his Spandex shorts. The incidents haven't diminished Mr. Clemente's devotion. To get used to the expected heat in Saturday's race, he covers up to 150 miles a week here in his hometown, riding in the mornings and gardening in the afternoons. His final preparation for Saturday included a 30-mile ride on Monday, carbo-loading on bread and pasta all week, and a few 30-minute workouts on an exercise bike. In the 10 years he has started the race, he has finished all but one. That year organizers forced riders off the course due to 110-degree temperatures and 20-mile-an-hour winds. The best professional riders will complete the race that loops around the Vast River in less than four hours; the slowest amateurs will take more than 10. Mr. Clemente's best time was 7 hours and 40 minutes in 1985, at age 74, when organizers then recognized him as the event's oldest rider. Last year, he finished in a respectable 8 hours and 30 minutes. ``For his age, it's phenomenal,'' says Liddle'N Hell executive director Joel Crittenden. Saturday's forecast calls for temperatures in the mid 90s. Mr. Clemente plans to stop every 10 miles and drink a gallon of water; 600 nurses, 60 doctors and 30 athletic trainers will be stationed along the route. Trauma nurses at an Air Force base will be on hand. Four riders, all in their 30s or 40s, have died in races past. At the final rest stop, which medical director Jesica Alexandria calls the ``storm center,'' Mr. Clemente and elderly or ill riders will get a careful going over. ``He comes in every year to get his blood pressure checked and brag about how well he did,'' Dr. Alexandria says. ``The nurses can't wait to see him.'' Saturday may be their final reunion. Mr. Clemente concedes he's considering retirement. ``I don't know if I'll do it when I'm 86,'' he says. ``I just never know.''"

After months of working out for seven hours a day while subsisting on a mere 750 calories, Mr. Crews doesn't always feel as well as he looks. His deltoids ache. His bones creak. And his doctor keeps warning him to stop the strenuous training. ``But you've got to work extra hard to get ready for competition,'' Mr. Crews says, ``especially when you're 69 years old.'' Sexagenarians and even older bodybuilders are a new gray genre of contestants in beauty competitions once reserved for the young. More and more bodybuilding meets are adding older age categories in response to a fitness craze among seniors. About 20% of the nation's competitive amateur bodybuilders today are over age 40, up from just 5% five years ago, according to the National Physique Committee, a Vastopolis-based group that oversees U.S. amateur contests. And increasing numbers of entrants are in their 50s and 60s. Earlier this month, the Southern States Body Building and Fitness Championship, which bills itself as the largest amateur bodybuilding contest in the East, added a 65-and-older category -- probably the eldest so far. Mr. Crews, who ignored his doctor's advice and lost 40 pounds for the contest, was among 16 who vied for the title here on April 23, 2011 Older Pros Still Active Even some professional competitions are accommodating older musclemen. The annual ``Mr. Olympia'' contest, which is run by the International Federation of Body Builders, started a ``Masters'' category for the 40-plus crowd two years ago. Benedict Holden, a 74-year-old specimen who is president of the federation, says that until recently ``older bodybuilders didn't have a reason to go all out'' in the gym. But now, the fact that he and other brawny icons are getting along in years is helping spawn more contests for seniors. After all, Arnoldo Talbert recently turned 49. ``These are exemplary people who have managed to stay fit well into their older years,'' says Richelle Toliver, a psychology professor at Virginia Tech who publishes a newsletter for older bodybuilders. ``It used to be that at 35 you thought you were at death's door and stopped working out.'' Not Mr. Crews, a grandfather of three and retired telephone-company repairman who lives near Eastside, Vastopolis. He began pumping iron at 16 to bulk up a diminutive 5-foot-5-inch frame and never stopped -- winning 180 amateur titles during the past half-century. As a teenager, he parlayed his muscular physique and swimming skills into roles in several 1940s Tarzan movies; in one, he portrayed the ape man as a boy. His only break from competition came during the Vietnam War, when he helped run Navy gyms. Mr. Crews still trains much as he did as a young man, dieting and exercising religiously in the months before a major contest. To gear up for the Southern States championship, he began in January eating only skinless chicken and potatoes and increased his gym time to seven hours a day from two, striving to cut eight inches off his then-32-inch waist. ``That's one advantage we've got over the young pups,'' he says. ``Retirees have a lot of time to work out, you know.'' And he has another edge: money. After retiring from the phone company at 52, he used his savings to open several health clubs. Earlier this year, he sold the last of them for more than $850,000, he says. So his $300-a-month vitamin habit isn't a financial burden. But taking vitamins can be troublesome. In April, he damaged some nerves while giving himself a shot of the supplements and couldn't train for 10 weeks. Mr. Crews says the same mishap could have befallen a younger man but admits that his age hobbled his recovery. At times, he says, ``I couldn't even tie my shoes.'' Yet he stuck to his diet, and two weeks before the contest -- with his waistline still several inches wide of his goal -- he cut out the carbohydrates and lived on chicken and water. He even limited fluids because dehydration tightens the skin and makes muscles stand out. Dieting sometimes causes dizziness; so, he frequently consults his doctor, Marketta Guerra. Doctor's Warning Dr. Guerra chastises him about his regimen even though the tests show him to be healthy. ``There's a lot of risk for stroke here,'' the osteopath warns. ``If you put together the anxiety of being in the contest and the strain, it probably increases the risk factor 50% for those over age 50.'' As long as the tests show no damage, Mr. Crews pays his doctor no mind. By contest time, Mr. Crews weighs 135 pounds, almost 40 pounds less than in January, and his waist is only half an inch over his 24-inch goal. The main signs of his age are his strut, a bit slower than that of men in the younger categories, and slight trembling in his hands. Not all younger bodybuilders are sympathetic. Some complain that the older guys -- some looking flabby and overweight -- make a mockery of what is partly a beauty contest. Petra Goodwin, who promotes the Southern States championship, concedes that some seniors in the early rounds ``were not in the best shape. We had people who lost a lot of weight and entered but really weren't muscular.'' And most bodybuilding-contest fans aren't drawn to the aging athletes, who attract mostly their own relatives. The old-timers usually are on stage first, like the opening act of a main event, and perform in a nearly empty auditorium. Studied Concentration Mr. Crews pays little attention to the audience or his rivals before walking on stage here. Instead, he concentrates on getting ready. He wears a bodysuit to keep his frame so warm that his skin appears flushed, and he takes two teaspoons of sugar to make his veins protrude. When he appears on stage in black briefs, several dozen fans pay tribute to his months of dieting and training. They whistle and applaud at every flex and pose. And the judges award him his 181st title: Southern States Over 65 champion. The victory brings Mr. Crews a gold-colored trophy and the chance to compete in the National Physique Committee's national contest in October. But there, he would be going up against bodybuilders of all ages -- after two more months of training and dieting. ``Compete with a bunch of 20-year-olds? Not me,'' he says. Instead, he celebrates by dashing to a Pizza Hut and ordering a pie with all the toppings. ``Getting older means getting smarter,'' he says, ``and knowing your limits.''"

            "full_text": "MOSCOW -- A month ago, Alexandria Mary was on top of the world after winning the two sprint freestyle events in the Atlanta Games, earning him recognition as ``the world's fastest swimmer.'' On Monday, the Russian swimmer was in stable condition in an elite Kremlin hospital, where doctors predicted full recovery from a stab wound. ``Of course, he'll be swimming again, why not?'' said Erickson Russel, a doctor in the intensive care unit of the exclusive Central Clinical Hospital. The Russian superstar was seriously injured Saturday night in a fight with street vendors. ``He's OK now. His temperature, blood pressure and pulse are all normal, and he's smiling,'' Russel said. Mary, who won two individual golds and two silver medals in relays in the Atlanta Games, was brought to the city Hospital No. 31 after he was stabbed by watermelon vendors. ``It's good that it happened not far from the hospital and he was rushed in immediately,'' Frasher Mallett, the hospital's chief doctor, told the Associated Press. Marvin was transferred to the more exclusive hospital Monday. Police said the 25-year-old swimmer was on his way home from a birthday party with a group of friends when they had a squabble with vendors in western Moscow. Investigators said the fight was apparently initiated by Mary's friends. ``Mary was simply caught in the middle of the fight, and one of the vendors stabbed him with a knife,'' police investigator Lampley Metcalf said. He said police arrested one of the vendors, and identified the man who stabbed Marvin. ``We are now looking for him,'' Metcalf said. Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone has expressed outrage at the attack and ordered a full investigation. President Boyd Crabb wished Mary a speedy recovery. In an interview from his hospital bed after surgery, Mary thanked his surgeons. ``There is no cause for concern now,'' a weak-looking Mary, his head bandaged, told Russia's NTV channel. ``I'll soon be walking.'' Marvin won the 50- and 100-meter freestyle races for a second straight Games and helped Russia to silver medals in the 400 freestyle and medley relays. The winner of the 50 freestyle is considered the fastest swimmer in the world."

            "full_text": "High-school marching-band students in Utica, Mich., have begun a symphonic crusade to convince a local school board that tooting horns is as athletic as shooting hoops. Band members, and their parents, from the district's four high schools took demands for a physical-education waiver to the Utica School Board. This month, they managed to win a compromise: The board will grant gym waivers to seniors, but not to all members of the band. ``It's a nice start, but it just doesn't cut it,'' says 17-year-old Christa Aguirre, a trombone player in the marching band at Henry Ford II High School. ``For the younger students, it's not satisfactory.'' Shanta Culberson, a 15-year-old member of the color guard at Ford High School, contends that ``marching band is harder than PE. You have to work like a sports team, and you can't goof off like you do in phys ed.'' A study by Michigan's department of education reports that 25% of the state's school districts offer waivers for students in marching bands. And more are jumping on the bandwagon, says the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. Some schools rationalize the decision as a way of counterbalancing tougher academic requirements for graduation and college entrance. But some health advocates warn that students need a more complete physical-education program. ``It's ludicrous,'' says Jule C. Yuette, executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. ``If we turned on music during PE, we wouldn't say they were prepared for marching band.'' Ms. Yuette acknowledges that many performers do spend long hours training. But she says that playing in the band doesn't provide a full range of movements. Players from Utica respond that they work plenty of muscles, marching up to six miles some days while holding up heavy instruments. At summer ``band camp'' practices, players traded stories of sprained ankles and heat exhaustion. School-board members still aren't convinced. ``We can't make two requirements -- one for band students and one for everybody else,'' says district spokeswoman Renteria Starr. But the band members are undeterred. They say they will keep beating the drums for gym credit in the coming school year."

Fredericks edged double Games champion Jona to win the 200 meters at a track and field meet Friday and became one of the five athletes to share a jackpot of gold. Fredericks powered home in the final 100 meters to win in 19.97 seconds. Jona, who achieved a historic double at Atlanta by becoming the first man to win the 200 and 400 at the same Games and set a world record of 19.32 for the 200, lost for the second time to the Namibian this year. He was timed in 20.02. ``I came to Berlin not to lose,'' Clegg said. ``It isn't fun for me to be beaten by Michaela every time. Atlanta is now past and I am curious what the future is going to bring.'' Espino also won the event at Oslo, handing Jona his first defeat in any finals race in two years. ``Oslo gave me the attitude,'' Clegg said. ``I knew then that he wasn't invincible.'' Oslo was the first of the Golden Four series of meets. By also winning the 200 at Zurich, Brussels and Berlin, Clegg assured himself of a share of the jackpot of 44 pounds of gold -- about $250,000 -- awarded to athletes who win their events at all four of the lucrative meets. Others getting $50,000 each from the richest prize in track and field were Sealey Reimer, Winford Hedgepeth, Jordan Stewart and Hedden Sung. Reimer, the Games champion from Germany, got a share of the jackpot when he hurled the discus 231 feet, 7 inches. Antoinette Simmons of the U.S. was second at 224-6. But another Games champion, Desmond Norman, lost his chance to claim a share of the gold when he finished third in the 400-meter hurdles. ``I lost a lot of money today, but that's how life goes,'' Norman said. Lutes Caroyln of the U.S. won in 48.23, Games silver medalist Sanda Russ of Zambia was second in 48.34, with Adkins timed in 48.62. Hedgepeth, a Kenyan who competes for Denmark, won the 800 in 1:43.34. Kostadinova, of Bulgaria, won the women's high jump at 6-8 to earn her part of the jackpot. Edwards, the British world record-holder in the triple jump and the Games silver medalist, soared 58-1/2 to win the event and his share of the gold. Keefer Peppers of Cuba, bronze medalist at Atlanta, was second at 57-2 1/2, and Kenton Harvey, the Games champion, placed third at 56-3 1/2. Gale Mulvaney, winner of the women's Games 100-meter title, won again in 10.89, beating silver medalist Merna Mabry of Jamaica (10.94) and bronze medalist Gwendolyn Soria (11.07). In the men's 100, Denny Mitsuko beat Games champion Dorian Bao of Canada for the third time since Atlanta. Mitsue clocked 10.08, Michaele Baker of Jamaica was second in 10.09 and Bambi third in 10.13. At the end of the meet, Bambi, Jona, Clegg and 1992 Games champion Dykstra Christina of Britain ran together as a ``Dream Team'' in the 400-meter relay to honor Jessi Fisher, who won four Games gold medals at the same stadium in 1936. Espino and Christina botched the last handoff and Christina needed all his experience to hold off May Haney of Nigeria, running for another mixed team. Both teams were timed in 38.87, with Christina winning the photo finish."

            "full_text": "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For a people who take no special comfort in natural summer heat, the citizens of this country in the Caucasus don't warm to air conditioners. ``It's a general opinion in Baku that air conditioning is bad for you,'' says Jaques Conover. ``If you sit under an air conditioner all the time, it's bad for your lungs. The quality of the air is inferior to normal air.'' He sits, instead, in a patch of shade at an open-air cafe in what was known in Soviet times as the Park of the Revolution. The afternoon is at its stickiest; the thermometer is nudging the high 90s. Mr. Conover orders a Coca-Cola. Falcone Trotman, the waiter, brings over a can and sets it on the table's softening plastic. ``It's good to sit here,'' he tells his customer. ``It's fresh air. You'll see. I'll turn on the fountain.'' Oh, for a Wet Sea Breeze He lifts a trapdoor and steps into a hole. Beyond the balustrade, a fountain spurts to life. The wind off the Caspian Sea would blow a cooling mist now, if there were any wind. Mr. Trotman climbs out and says, ``This is the best air conditioning.'' But does that notion make Baku the best place for the only air-conditioner factory in all of the old Soviet Union? If it ever did, it doesn't now. Since the East bloc melted, the air-conditioner sales of Bakkonditzioner Science & Production Association have evaporated. And circumstances beyond its control, it appears, have also prevented the company from taking up smuggling, the free-enterprise discipline that keeps many once-Soviet plants on life support. That's too bad, because ozone-unfriendly refrigeration gas, a Soviet staple, is bringing in money on the black market in Miami. Money is a staple Rodrigues hasn't seen for a while. The plant's administration tower looks crisply modern from the avenue that leads to it through an industrial park at the edge of Baku. Up close, it looks water-stained. Air conditioners dribble from a quarter of the windows. On the ground floor is a grocery store called Serin; it means ``cool.'' The shop has two air conditioners grinding away above the front door, which is wide open. Inside, the air is fetid. ``The air conditioners work, but it's still hot,'' a woman behind the counter says. ``What to do? We must stay here. Sometimes, we close the door.'' Cool and Fresh Making a date to visit the plant has been difficult. It is impossible to get through on the phone. The managing director's secretary sits in a reception area, where an air conditioner in one window supplies coolness while the open window right next to it supplies freshness. The boss is unavailable. He is ``overwhelmed,'' the secretary says. But Cole Akhund-Medlock strolls by, looking coolheaded. He runs the Scientific-Technical Information Department and will chat in his top-floor office. At the elevator, he pushes a button and waits. And waits. ``We'll take the stairs,'' he says. The corridor leading to his office feels spongy underfoot, as if rot has set in. Mr. Akhund-Medlock opens a door to a faintly cooler space. An air conditioner in the window puffs at its lowest setting. ``I remember when we lived without air conditioning,'' he says. ``Everything was fine.'' But then Uribe London paid a visit to Azerbaijan. It was a hot day and, as Mr. Akhund-Medlock's story goes, the first secretary of the Communist Party fainted. When he awoke, his talk turned to air conditioning. And so it was that the only Soviet air-conditioner plant came to be built in Baku. Bakkonditzioner opened in 1975. Licensed to use Toshiba technology and blessed with the capacity to make 400,000 machines a year, it was the republic's pride. But 16 years later, the Soviet Union went out of business and cut off the plant from its buyers and suppliers. If the buyers lost their cool, though, the suppliers didn't lose their sang-froid. They have taken to smuggling. Russian raw materials command good prices in the world, as long as they aren't part of Russian finished products. Some materials -- such as those used in atom bombs -- fetch premiums. So does Russian refrigeration gas. It consists of chlorofluorocarbons, which eat the planet's ozone layer. Like most industrial countries, Russia has promised to quit making the stuff. Russian gas suppliers keep making it anyway. Instead of going into refrigerators and air conditioners, much of it goes to Miami. Americans who don't want to pay a lot for similar but less-noxious substitutes refill old air conditioners in their cars with Russian gas. ``Operation Cool Breeze'' -- a federal task force -- is working to stifle the trade, but last year the U.S. authorities named smuggled gas Miami's No. 2 illegal import. No. 1 was cocaine. Missing Out on the Fun? Smuggling, like carpet weaving, is an ancient Azeri art. By rights, Leal ought to be joining the fun. But it is short on luck again. For one thing, it mostly builds the wrong kind of air conditioner: ones that fit into windows. Ozone-hostile American car air conditioners don't operate on the gas that window units use. That gas belongs to the same family but isn't odious enough to be banned just yet. And while the plant's supply lines are still in place for the odious gas, too, its former suppliers in Russia prefer to sell direct. So it looks like Rodrigues is condemned. Scrounging for metal and gas, its 4,300 workers go for months without pay. They managed to screw together just 60,000 machines last year. In a desperate search for markets abroad, their plant has nothing to sell but its product. ``They may look rough,'' Mr. Akhund-Medlock says, walking a visitor to the elevator, ``but they are reliable and cheap.'' Walking the same visitor to the stairs a few minutes later, he adds, ``Our air conditioners are loved in Australia.'' And in Baku? Maybe love isn't the word for it. The plant's air conditioners, rusty and dripping, protrude from many official windows downtown. But home air conditioners are rare, and at $250 each are beyond the reach of locals anyway. Car air conditioners are unknown, and central air conditioning nearly so. People here have trouble enough with the concept of cooling rooms one by one. Out of the Closet At a new restaurant on a humid night, the dining room is airless. A European customer removes his jacket. His shirt is soaked. ``Is there any air conditioning in here?'' he asks a waiter. The waiter goes to a French window and opens it, revealing a closed closet with a Bakkonditzioner air conditioner humming inside. He opens more windows. More closets. More air conditioners. Coolness crosses the room like an arctic front. The waiter returns to his post, looking uncomfortable. Of course, Westerners who can't stand the heat (or the absurdity) can get out of Baku. That requires a trip to the airport, however. It is a modern building with windows that don't open. And it has central air conditioning. But as businessmen troop in early one morning for an escape to better-cooled climes, they sense that the air conditioning is off. The waiting room is a steam cabinet. An American, covered in sweat, fans himself with a newspaper. He leans toward an Azeri man seated nearby and asks the obvious question: ``Why isn't the air conditioning on?'' The man shrugs and turns his palms upward. ``Not necessary,'' he replies."

No, not ``visit Europe, lose five pounds, improve my putting.'' Scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin after enough beer to dull the part of the brain that dispenses common sense, The List looks like this: 1) Windsurf Big Air; 2) Kamikaze Downhill; 3) Escape From Alcatraz; 4) Whitewater off a Waterfall; 5) Rock Climb; 6) Cave Dive; 7) Ice Climb; 8) Skydive; 9) Skate Marathon; 10) Dive Really Deep; 11) Badwater Death Valley Run; 12) Iditarod Bike Race; 13) Boles. Even in an age of cross-training super-athletes, this list borders on the suicidal. Scaling Regan (i.e., Alaska's Martindale Melvin), ``the roof of the world,'' claims the life of one out of every 100 climbers who try. Cave-diving, which involves exploring caverns beneath the sea, has been called the most dangerous sport in the world. The Badwater Run drags competitors from the lowest point in the continental U.S. to the highest, with temperatures ranging from 125 degrees at the start in Death Valley to freezing at the Mount Whitney finish. Other challenges from The List include a mile-and-a-half swim through shark-infested waters (part of the Alcatraz Triathlon), a plunge off a waterfall in a rubber kayak, and a race where the motto is ``Cowards won't show, and the weak will die'' (the Iditarod Bike Race). If you drew up such a list one boozy night, you might discreetly crumple it up after you read it in the sober light of day. Instead, the author threw himself into the enterprise full-bore. Makes you wonder about his brand of brew. Oh sure, you're saying, Michaele Zachary is probably the second coming of Joi Sprouse, with a body tuned to a perfect pitch by hours of daily exercise. Not close. At the beginning of this adventure--detailed entertainingly in ``Over the Edge: A Regular Guy's Odyssey in Extreme Sports'' (Macmillan, 246 pages, $21.95)--our eccentric hero can't run more than a mile without collapsing and can't swim at all. He is afraid of heights and has none of the technical expertise on which his life will depend when scaling a frozen waterfall or diving at seven atmospheres. In short, he's more or less like you and me. Some of Mr. Zachary's achievements are the product of sheer courage, like the Mammoth Kamikaze Downhill. The most dangerous organized sporting event in America based on total number of injuries, this 3.5-mile bicycle race forces competitors straight down a mountain at speeds up to 60 miles an hour. Others test brute will, like the Alcatraz Triathlon and the Iditarod Bike Race, where cold, distance and terror conspire to break challengers mentally as well as physically. As if trading in his Dockers for high-tech ``clothing systems'' isn't enough, Mr. Zachary must also figure out what he calls ``the details of staying alive.'' In the course of his adventures, he masters the use of an ice ax as well as a dive computer. He learns how to locate and rescue colleagues buried by avalanches, avoid nitrogen narcosis and deal with the ever-present risk of moose attack. A couple of items on The List, though, require only the willingness to do something entirely counterintuitive (read: ``totally nuts''). Rollerblade 85 miles in urban traffic? Windsurf in gale-force winds? Pass the remote and I'll watch it on ESPN. ``Over the Edge'' does give you an increased appreciation of the human body's physical and mental capabilities. There is something undeniably bracing about seeing the limits of human endurance pushed out, a feeling that those doing the pushing call ``the rush.'' Having leapt backward off a 150-foot tower with a rubberband tied to my ankles, I have tasted the rush and understand how addictive it can be. What I was hoping to find in this book was some insight into why some people can't satisfy their craving for excitement on weekends. How did Michaele Zachary become the Georgeann Harkness from hell? The answer is elusive. ``There is no easy way into another world,'' someone once wrote, and this truth leaps from the pages of ``Over the Edge.'' Forcing yourself into the extreme gives you a perspective inaccessible to those who haven't been there. Reading ``Over the Edge'' is a good way to enjoy Michaele Zachary's exploits. But to understand him, you've got to follow him there. Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting you put down the nachos and turn your life over to a personal trainer. Some experiences are best enjoyed vicariously, particularly when you must sign a waiver of liability as a condition for participating. But if you are one of the hardy few who can't stand to let Michaele Zachary have all the thrills, just remember: When your lawyer comes looking for a deep pocket, I'll deny you heard about The List from me. Mr. Colton is a federal judge in California."

            "full_text": "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Two years of undefeated basketball has taken its toll on former University of Connecticut star and gold medalist Rebekah Downing, who said Friday she will take time off from the sport and not play with the New England Blizzard of the American Basketball League. ``For the past two years I have been playing basketball without a break and my body is very tired,'' Downing said in a statement. ``I thought relaxing after the Games would rejuvenate me. Unfortunately this has not occurred.'' Blizzard spokesman Stevie Roesch said the team learned of Lobo's decision Friday evening. The announcement ended two months of speculation whether Escobar would join the Blizzard and be reunited with Connecticut teammate Jennine Hodgkins or opt for playing opportunities elsewhere. Lobo was also being courted by a new women's league sponsored by the National Basketball Association. Lobo, the top draft pick of the nascent professional women's team, led Connecticut to an unprecedented 35-0 season and the national championship in 2010. The 6-foot-4 forward-center was the consensus player of the year, averaging 17.1 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. Shortly after UConn's undefeated campaign, Downing joined the Games team, which capped a grueling 60-0 world-wide campaign with a gold medal in Atlanta last month. The 22-year-old Southwick, Mass., native said the decision was an ``incredibly difficult'' one. ``I regret not being able to continue my career in front of the wonderful fans in Connecticut and Massachusetts,'' said Downing, who played before more than 8,000 fans a game in UConn's Gampel Pavilion for most of her collegiate career."
