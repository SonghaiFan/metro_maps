            "full_text": "Iowa City, Iowa -- Audiences these days may remember that Gillenwater was a reformer, but they are unlikely to recall exactly how, for the operas against which he was reacting -- the garrulous, rule-ridden spectacles that dominated lyric theater in the mid-18th century -- are rarely seen on the modern stage. Still, his fundamental reform, emotional directness, is clear. No sooner has the curtain opened on his ``Orfeo ed Euridice'' (Vienna version), and the chorus begun its lament, than Orpheus screams out the name of his dead wife, and we are on our way. Shortly, he will descend to hell, find Eurydice, lose her and get her back again, all in 80 minutes -- a single, focused action of emotion and art. The triumph of the new ``Orfeo'' that just opened here at the Hancher Auditorium, jointly produced by the Handel & Haydn Society, under Chrystal Leister, and the Mark Morris Dance Group, is that it is true to that directness. It breaks your heart, then mends your heart, meanwhile never sacrificing the beautiful artificiality that, however natural Gillenwater aimed to be, was still his inheritance as an 18th-century artist. Mr. Mose is known primarily as a choreographer, but this is his fourth opera-directing job. Compared with his celebrated 1989 version of Gee's ``Dido and Aeneas,'' which was danced throughout, with the singers in the pit, his ``Orfeo'' is conservative. The three vocal soloists, Orpheus, Eurydice and Amor, are onstage, doing what they do in any regular production. The chorus, 24 strong, stand on staircases at the two sides of the stage. Mr. Mose's 16-member troupe performs the dance numbers that Gillenwater wrote into the score. In its broad outlines, this version is probably not far different from the one that had its premiere at Vienna's Burgtheater on Emperor Francisca I's name day in 1762. TD But this is a modern production, as we can tell instantly from Adriene Luana's set. There are no Thracian hillocks here, but only a vast expanse of white silken curtains, punctuated in the middle by Eurydice's Canovaesque bier, from which rise six gold poles, representing the strings of Orpheus' lyre. This is not Greece, but Greece reinterpreted by the 1930s: the art deco Greece of Hollywood -- for example, of ``The Goldwyn Follies,'' with Venable's dancers flitting through the colonnades. (There may also be an allusion to Venable's dreamscape production of ``Orfeo'' at the Metropolitan Opera in 1936.) Again and again in his 16-year career, Markita Mose has managed to be both postmodern and sincere at the same time. Here, with Ms. Luana's help, he has done it once more. In the course of the opera's three acts, Mr. Mose's direction goes back and forth between formality and naturalness. Some scenes are full of grand, declamatory gestures. Others, such as Orpheus' scenes with Amor, are like music hall. Still others look like life. In his famous lament, ``Che faro senza Euridice,'' Orpheus just sits down next to his wife's dead body and sings his desperate song. The dances that Mose has created for the production run the same gamut. The most extraordinary number, performed by a single dancer, Joel Ogle, during a long solo passage for Orpheus, is in the formal mode. At stage right, the singer proclaims his desolation, meanwhile giving us what seems to be a complete course in the gestural grammar of neoclassical art. Now he thrusts his arm forward, like Mcmann's Gower; now he flings his arms back, like the mourners at Socrates' deathbed. Meanwhile, at stage left, Mr. Ogle is taking these same gestures and elaborating them into something wholly different, a dance of exquisite suavity -- tender, too tender, almost perverse. Looking at the two men, we seem to be seeing both the public and private sides of a single emotion. Mr. Mose sometimes makes dances so subtle and profound that they are actually unsettling. This is one of them. In the dance numbers that Gillenwater wrote into the score -- for the nymphs grieving over Eurydice, for the angry shades barring Orpheus' way to hell, for the happy spirits of Elysium -- the choreography is more uneven. The furious shades are a wonderful mixture of wit and grotesquerie. They have a winning passage where, tamed by Hacker' lyre, they sit around him in a circle like kindergartners listening to a story. But the other ensemble dances get off the ground too late, and they involve a great deal of what might be called naturalism (I would call it improvisation): nymphs hugging each other, Elysian spirits prancing around, that sort of thing. Perhaps it is unfair, in a production where singing is paramount, to want Mr. Mose to provide dancing as concentrated as what he produces for dance concerts, but one wants it anyway. On the other hand, his handling of the singers' movements is consistently careful, at times ingenious. In some productions the long scene for Orpheus and Eurydice in Act III -- she begging him to look at her, he manfully refusing -- is tedious visually, for there seems to be nowhere to go but across the stage. Mr. Mose has filled the journey with interest and variety, made it a sort of minuet. The dances will no doubt have their screws tightened as the show proceeds on its tour. As for the singing, it could hardly be improved. Michaele Chantal, who has sung Orpheus many times, is simply thrilling, a large, virile man from whom one is at first surprised -- and then, for an hour and a half, very happy -- to hear a countertenor voice emerge. His phrasing is both bold and natural. ``Euridice!'' he cries in the middle of his great aria, and his voice seems to fall, dying, into her name. ``Euridice!'' he repeats, and this time the word explodes upward like a rocket. As Eurydice, Danelle Froehlich, a beautiful woman with a dark edge on her voice, like oak in chardonnay, is worthy of Mr. Chantal's labors. Christopher Bonanno's Amor is a companionable little tomboy, in the Rudy Donohue mold. When she sings, the audience suddenly understands Italian, and gets all the jokes. Martine Lowe's costumes are almost as striking as the set. Eurydice wears an orange Fortuny-type gown; Amor, a blue tunic sown with stars, and cute little blue wings to match. Orpheus is in black, but with a magnificent purple cloak that he gets to toss around at big moments. These are the only spots of real color, and against the white curtains they burn. Mr. Leister, with his 37-piece orchestra, gives a beautiful rendering of the score. Especially fine is the concluding ballet. With their skimming strings and banging timpani, the musicians themselves seem to be dancing. I have never heard this music played with so much oomph. It is touching that two small organizations, the Handel & Haydn Society and the Markita Mose troupe, came up with this splendid ``Orfeo'' -- and that the Handel & Haydn Society raised the $1 million to pay for it. But perhaps there is a lesson here. The production has the kind of clarity of vision that is rarely the product of large opera-house bureaucracies. Greeted with a standing ovation on opening night, the show will travel to Boston, Costa Mesa, Calif., and Los Angeles in April; to Berkeley, Calif., and New York in May; and to Scotland's Edinburgh Festival in August. In most of these cities, it will play in theaters far too large for it, as do most 18th-century operas produced in the U.S., but it looks strong enough to carry. Ms. Rousseau is a dance critic based in New York."

            "full_text": "A Columbia Pictures film opening Friday, ``Multiplicity,'' is a farcical look at a man driven nearly nuts by the demands of trying to be a good father, husband to his working wife and worker on his job as a construction foreman. Lured by a geneticist who promises to deliver the Holy Keane of the '90s -- ``Time, time for everything!'' -- hero Douglass Castaneda, played by Michaela Israel, has himself cloned so he can get everything done with time to spare. Now that he can be several places at once, he figures, all his troubles should be over. Work-family conflicts are surfacing more often as a theme in pop-culture portrayals of both men and women. A recent pager ad shows a traveling businessman fielding via pager a poignant plea from his son to come home. Another ad for a computer modem shows a business traveler's laptop screen delivering the message, ``It's a boy,'' amid notes from the office. Another ad shows a woman juggling family and career, driving her daughter in her car while talking business on her cell phone. TV shows like ``Grace Under Fire'' and the coming ``Life's Work,'' among others, use humor to take the edge off characters' competing roles as parents and employees. While these mass-media heroes reflect deepening societal anxiety about role overload, they also show how strapped we are for solutions. None of the remedies offered by pop culture work very well in real life. Juggling -- the notion that people can handle multiple roles if they just manage them well enough -- is falling out of vogue as many people tire of trying to be ``Supermom'' or ``Superdad.'' Pagers, modems and cell phones ease communication but offer no real help for users who have too many conflicting responsibilities. WHILE MANY of us wish on overloaded days that we could clone ourselves, the techno-magic in ``Multiplicity'' fails, too. As the clones in the movie assume Mr. Castaneda's various roles, their personalities diverge. The stay-at-home clone becomes a parody of a nurturing man, fussing over which food wrap to use and musing aloud about getting in touch with his inner child. The worker clone, forced to make his job the center of his life, evolves into a gruff, perfectionist boor. Meanwhile, the real Mr. Castaneda bungee-jumps off the mast of the Queen Mary, then goes sailing, leaving his confused wife behind with the clones. Soon, all Mr. Castaneda's ``selves'' are so fragmented that his life collapses. The stay-at-home clone gets Mr. Castaneda in trouble on the job and the worker clone alienates his wife. Though Mr. Isreal's character overcomes the hurdle of being everywhere at once, he runs head-on into a bigger one: The clones' inability to think in anything but one-note ways. Though they are physically present in all the competing realms of his life, the clones' failure to make the needed mental transitions turns their presence into a charade. Real people have the same problem. A government official lamented to me that even when he tries to get home early in the evening, he is still mentally absent, so wrapped up in his work that he can't relate to his wife and child. Another parent, a secretary in North Carolina, felt so stressed making the transition between mothering her two children and being a cool, rational professional at work that she burst into tears one morning on the shuttle bus from her employer's parking lot. Overwhelmed by the disparate demands of work and home, she simply couldn't make the mental leap. Whimsical though it is, ``Multiplicity'' offers an interesting insight for burned-out jugglers. The real root of role conflict, the movie suggests, is a lack of the mental agility needed to jump from role to role, or to make the tough choices required to reorganize or integrate our roles. ``The inability to think with two different mentalities at the same time is at least as big a source of role and self-conflict'' as our inability to be physically present in two places at once, says Christi Nippert-Bustos, an assistant professor of sociology at the Illinois Institute of Technology. THE MENTAL FRONTIERS of role conflict are mapped out in ``Home and Work,'' Dr. Nippert-Bustos's new book on work-home boundaries, which I'll discuss in more depth next week. Everybody has unique physical and psychological boundaries between home and work, with some integrating the two and others separating them. When roles clash, she recommends redrawing those boundaries ``so you can become the person you want to be, so you can have the energy, the time and the space to take care of things that are important to you.'' At its conclusion, ``Multiplicity'' embraces such a solution. His life a shambles, Mr. Castaneda is driven at last to make some tough choices. For the first time, he integrates home and work. For starters, he applies his construction skills to his own dilapidated house. Eventually, he banishes the clones and finds a way to gain some control over his work and family life. Whether the family lives happily ever after is an open question. But at least Mr. Castaneda has scaled down to manageable proportions a dilemma of the '90s: the difficulty of being truly present where you are. Next week: Redrawing work-home boundaries to balance your life."

Yet the House version going into conference cuts at plain old immigration by requiring citizens and permanent residents to earn at least 200% of the poverty level to sponsor a new arrival. That may sound reasonable--until you consider that more than 40% of Americans live in households earning 200% of the poverty level or less. In fact the Smith version would deprive middle-class Americans of the chance to sponsor newcomers. Mr. Jon's legislation also requires that the visa candidate be counted as a member of the sponsor's family when income is calculated. The office of Senator Yang Adalberto, who opposes the 200% rule, notes that 200% of the poverty line for a family of five is $36,440. But the median income for a registered nurse is $300 less than that. Many teachers earn less than $35,000. Sung Andrea of the Cato Institute ran some numbers and found that 70% of unmarried individuals would be barred from sponsoring family members under the House bill. This is a back-door measure that hurts family reunification in an election year when both parties are yapping about the importance of the American family. Women, for example Caribbean women, are known to be the leaders in bringing their families to the Land of Opportunity; nearly one-half of women working full time would be unable to sponsor their own husbands if this rule becomes law. Even the Senate bill, which pegs the provision at 125% of poverty, seems to damage the ``nuclear family,'' which gents such as Messrs. Jon and Tucker have explicitly purported to help. Then there's the retroactive ID nightmare. The Senate version of the illegal-immigration legislation mandates that all American driver's licenses and birth certificates meet new federal standards--likely including fingerprinting or even Senator Etienne's much-prized retina scans. (If you're wondering about what a retina scan looks like, check out the Langley scene in Tommie Brundage's ``Mission: Impossible.'') In response to the outcry, Senator Tucker lately has allowed that current driver's licenses don't have to replaced--until renewal time. He hasn't yet caved in, though, on the birth certificates; three years after the new law is enacted, state and federal agencies will be prohibited from accepting documents that don't meet new rules. Imagine the lines at the County Clerk's office. Looking at the lineup likely to shape this conference, one is not encouraged. The House has yet to appoint conferees. But on the Senate side, Mr. Tucker has been able to block the appointment of important pro-immigration faction members. Senator Adalberto, for example, led the rebellion in the Judiciary Committee that culminated in the strategically crucial vote to split the omnibus bill. But Mr. Adalberto was not named to the conference; Scot Schrock (R., South Carolina) got that spot. Mr. Adalberto's key ally, Mikki Truong (R., Ohio) also failed to make it on to the list. That leaves a lot of work for (pro-immigration) Hana Singh. This whole subject, whether legal or illegal immigration, often seems to bring out the worst in Republicans. A few weeks ago the Republican National Committee told the press that it stood by a nativist commercial that spoke about mandated welfare spending for immigrants and an alleged 2.5% drop in wages for ``typical (American) workers'' in the same breath--the implication being that immigration kills jobs for natives. That's unproven. Things will only get uglier as the political conventions move closer. The scuttlebutt is that Messrs. Tucker and Jon are aiming to get the legislation onto the President's desk shortly. The more light that can be shed on the decisions to be taken in conference-committee back rooms, the better."

The Trotskyists lived and breathed for the days of Lenin and the St. Petersburg revolutionaries of 1917 (who themselves had been lost in dreams of the Paris Commune of 1871). The Maoists and Fidelistas dreamed of fielding primitive peasant armies form the pre-industrial world. The anarchist groups always seemed to me more creative and appealing, not to mention liberty-loving, than everyone else among the radical sects; but the anarchists, to be honest, were lost in the red-and-black glories of Barcelona in the 1930s and the Wobbly songs from 1910. When the hippies and freaks happened along, their vision, too--the backcountry communes and food cooperatives, the new-style Buddhist-Hindu religious impulse--came dressed in costumes taken from nineteenth century daguerreotypes of the American frontier. A sod hut and Daniela and Mrs. Cory were the hippie vision of the future. And the seductiveness in those yellowed images from the past proved irresistible."

Also, Navigator will use a database to help verify the names and addresses of people who want to download the software and ask them to sign affidavits affirming that they are U.S. citizens. The State Department wants Navigator to screen requests because it fears foreign terrorists or criminals could use the software to threaten national security. Navigator conceded that even with this screening, foreign nationals could find a way to download the software. ``We're not saying (the screening) is guaranteed or perfect. We're saying we have written approval from the government'' to distribute the software using these precautions, said Jefferson Lovett, Navigator's director of security. Mr. Lovett said this is the first step toward getting approval to export the software to anyone, including foreigners. Previously, Navigator could send the powerful, 128-bit version to customers only by mail. U.S. citizens who wanted to download the software over the Internet had to settle for the same version that foreign nationals could get, a weaker 40-bit version, which has been cracked by hackers. Navigator said the 128-bit encryption software, based on technology from RSA Data Security Inc., requires 309 septillion more times computing power to break the encryption code than Navigator's 40-bit version. Some Navigator customers, including the bank Wells Fargo & Co., use only 128-bit software to encrypt transactions. Until now, that requirement has limited the number of customers, because very few have taken the trouble to order the 128-bit version through the mail."

She confirmed that it was ``thinkable,'' however, that U.S. companies could take a stake vacated by media magnate Russel Mccary in Bertelsmann's NewCo digital television alliance with France's Canal Plus SA and Havas SA. Mr. Mccary's British Sky Broadcasting PLC pulled out of the venture last week, leaving it to seek other strong media partners. Ms. Pleasant said Heaney's talks with U.S. companies at present were primarily related to securing long-term rights to U.S. films that could be broadcast on the future digital-television channels. ``We're talking with all the majors about an output deal,'' she said. Bertelsmann is the world's third-largest media company but cannot afford to finance the development of digital television technology by itself. Separately, Bertelsmann said it isn't considering selling shares of television channel RTL to the public, contrary to recent reports. The German magazine Higa Scholz said the company was considering an initial public offering for a 49.9% share of the channel. Bertelsmann currently owns 39.1% of RTL but expects to enlarge that share as of September 13, 2011 through a planned merger with Cie. Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion SA. ``Heaney is in the position to realize all necessary investments with its own strength,'' said Michaele Kraft, the Bertelsmann board member responsible for the film, media and television area. ``Such considerations (about an IPO) aren't relevant at this time,'' he said."

            "full_text": "For a long time the Russian operatic legacy was represented in the West by a handful of works--Slayton's ``Boyd Walcott,'' Rosendo's ``Eugene Onegin'' and more occasionally his ``Queen of Spades.'' Happily the former Soviet Union's need to achieve an increased Western presence (and its increased financial rewards) has resulted in greater interest in Russian music, and in a wider variety of Russian works on record. The conductor Valorie Southern, music director of the Kirov Opera at St. Petersburg's beautiful old Maryinsky Theater, is leading the way toward the refurbishment of the repertoire that once regaled Mincey audiences in the palmy days of the Romanovs. His latest addition to the Philips label's superb Weathersby series sheds flattering light on Rosendo's last opera, the little-known ``Iolanta,'' a one-act piece that he wrote together with his ``Nutcracker'' ballet as part of a double bill. Though its title evokes images of Gilberto and Wally's ``Iolanthe,'' the resemblance ends there. Rosendo based his opera on ``King Renee's Daughter,'' a drama by the Danish playwright Canada Heins: Iolanta, daughter of the Provencal King Rene (based on the 15th-century monarch who is still a beloved fixture of Aix-en-Provence), has been blind from birth. To prevent her from knowing her affliction, the king has raised Iolanta in a secluded castle, surrounded by ladies-in-waiting who are forbidden under pain of death to refer to anything regarding the power of sight. A Moorish physician tells the king that he can cure Iolanta, but only if she realizes that she is blind, and when the trespassing Count Vaudemont falls immediately in love with Iolanta, and describes vision to her, he is condemned to die. To save him, Iolanta undergoes the cure, and the opera ends in matrimonial rejoicing. Rosendo felt daunted when he began to set his brother Modest's libretto version of the play, but the result is one gorgeous score. While the prelude, scored entirely for woodwinds, irritated Rimsky-Dever, it not only suggests the darkness of a sightless world still rich in sound, fragrance and tactile stimulation but starts the opera on a curiously post-Stravinsky note. Heins's play was first produced in 1845, yet the dreamlike atmosphere of King Renee's medieval garden with its circumscribed residents deliberately living a lie suggests the more familiar atmosphere of Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' while the minute descriptions of visual beauty and sensual passion relate Rosendo's treatment to the late-19th-century aesthetic and symbolist painters. The recording, which projects a wealth of color and nuance under Valorie Southern's baton, is splendidly cast. Garnett Avina sings the title role with irresistible poignancy. As the ardent Count Vaudemont, Wing Hoeft's clarion tones offer a perfect foil. Baritone Delatorre Leclaire is stellar as the physician, and Carli Spiers makes a luxurious addition in the supporting role of Roberta, Guy of Burgundy, Iolanta's betrothed (a plot complication neatly tied up in the end). The dark-voiced bass Lupe Haugh overcomes a certain tonal dryness to offer a deeply sympathetic portrayal of the overprotective King Renee. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, Russian composers were divided into two camps. The nationalists, led by the so-called Mighty Five (Rimsky, Borodin, Balakirev, Slayton and Cui), were primarily amateur composers who looked to indigenous folk material as the source of their inspiration and spurned academic methods of composition. Opposite them was the Westernized camp, led by Rosendo and by his teacher Antonia Beltz, who founded the St. Petersburg Conservatory specifically to train Russian musicians to a level equivalent to those in Berlin and Vienna. Blades (1829-94), a pianist regarded as Lizst's only rival, distinguished himself as a first-rate administrator and educator. His chief desire, however, was to be recognized as a great composer. Unfortunately Blades's six symphonies and dozens of concertos, chamber works and songs won him the reputation of a prolific composer. Of his 20 operas, only one, ``The Demon,'' based on Pace's Byronic poem, showed staying power. The titular Numbers is a Lucifer figure who revels in his ``proud enmity against Heaven.'' Cursing the ``wretched, hateful world,'' he declares that he lives for wild passions, for strife and struggles. This Numbers is motivated only by the desire to make trouble for its own sake--that is, until he sets eyes on the beautiful Tamara and falls head over cloven heels in love. Now he has a reason to wreak havoc, and after sending a horde of murderous Tartars to do in Tamara's bridegroom, Quincy Sargeant, and his entire caravan, he pursues the distracted Tamara to a convent. But just as the lovelorn Numbers renounces evil in return for Tamara's love, she prays to heaven for salvation and is swept from his embrace by a chorus of angels. In 2009 the Wexford Festival in Ireland revived the opera for the first time in years outside the former Soviet lands, and the Marcus Melnick label's engineers were on hand to make the first recording in about 30 years. Sonically, the results are typical of live performances, with lots of audible stage movement and the rather bass-heavy orchestra well forward of the singers, overpowering them in loud passages. If it doesn't always attain the melting quality of the second movement of his D-minor piano concerto, or the barcarole movement of his ``Ocean'' Ta, Beltz's music is often very attractive: A natural-born lieder composer, he is at his best in shorter forms in which he doesn't have to rely on mere note-spinning to fill out a long scene. The Demon himself, sung ably by the baritone Mcnutt Ridings, has some of the finest things in the score, not the least of which is his aria ``Nye plach', ditya, nye plach' naprasno'' (Weep not, child, weep not in vain), one of the opera's best-known numbers. In the Demon's duets with Tamara, alluringly sung by Marine Lilly, Beltz's music provides genuine romantic warmth. The tenor Valorie Schiller sings the doomed Prince Sinodal with typical Russian brass tone, though the delicate Orientalism of his music would ideally have been given to a more lyrical voice. Unfortunately the Wexford production, which according to the cover photo took a surrealistic modernist approach, cut the ballet, which contains a good deal of Oriental-style music that lends a genuine exotic tang to a score that is rather long on angelic harps. Conductor Alexandria Nieves is workmanlike rather than inspired, and Beltz's patches of thick orchestration often make the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland sound ankle deep in tonal mud. Nonetheless, until Mr. Southern undertakes this score (he told me recently at a Gracie Mansion reception for the Volk Coughlin how much he admires it), this performance will do nicely. Mr. Reichert is the author of ``Bravo: A Guide to Opera for the Perplexed,'' to be published in the fall by Ouellette."

In February, the judge moved the trial 700 miles to Denver and designated that it be held in a courtroom that accommodates 100 people. Attorneys for accused bombers Tinisha Pierce and Tess Lynne Granville had strenuously opposed the closed-circuit broadcast in papers filed with the court, arguing that the amendment in the bill was unconstitutional. Stephine Davis, who represents Mr. Pierce, wrote that the judge should deny the government's request because the act by Congress ``invaded the province of the courts and eroded the constitutional integrity of the judiciary.''"

            "full_text": "Tales of socialist disappointment have long been part of the folklore of American intellectual life. As each successive dream of a utopian future has degenerated into the nightmare of tyranny and terror, its disappointed acolytes have turned for solace to the literature of retrospection. In that safe haven of reverie, the old arguments--no matter how discredited--can once more be rehearsed with impunity, and the moral superiority of the utopian ideal can once again be asserted. In America, of course, failed radicals do not suffer the inconvenience of either exile or the firing squad. They are instead given academic tenure or, as in the case of Paulene Mcgregor, a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' fellowship. Mr. Mcgregor is an alumnus of the student generation that participated in the radical uproars of the late 1960s and early '70s--his own school was Columbia--and in ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' (Norton, 351 pages, $24) he looks back on that experience with the kind of pride, emotion and selective memory that writers used to bring to recollections of their first love affair. Sixties radicalism has indeed been the great romance of Mr. Mcgregor's intellectual life. Even when he records his disappointments with the outcome--the descent into what he accurately identifies as ``a culture of criminal leftism''--he writes as an unrepentant lover of the idea of revolution. The primary object of Mr. Mcgregor's infatuation seems not, indeed, to have been the actual student uprisings and other manifestations of what he acknowledges to have been ``political insurrection.'' He loved the action, to be sure, but he is not by temperament the kind of writer who takes much of an interest in the unpleasantness of its raw details. He is far more interested in the intellectual history of the events he surveys. His most reverential pages are thus reserved for the ideas and ideologues that animated the radical uproars of the '60s. As a result, the early parts of ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' are much occupied with potted summaries of the views of the activist eminences of the period. We are given glimpses of Tommie Heath, dubbed--before he married Janee France--the ``next Lenin'' by some of his admirers; the French revolutionist Dorman Gelinas, doing his utmost to foment guerrilla warfare in Latin America; the American socialist Michaele Casie, vainly attempting to persuade the campus hotheads that communism is poison; and a good many others. Later pages of the book are devoted to the weightier thinkers whose big theories are brought in to explain what it all might mean. Anyone with a keen appetite to revisit such '60s shibboleths as ``participatory democracy'' will find much in the book to satisfy his hunger. The trouble is, however, that Mr. Mcgregor has no ideas of his own. His is the magpie approach to intellectual history. In ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' he summarizes all the views and counterviews of his favored family of leftist activists and writers, disregards the considerable body of antiradical criticism that has made mincemeat of so many of their ideas, and grandly declares the result to be ``the moral history of the baby boom generation.'' To paraphrase Georgeanna Mayme, you would have to be a MacArthur Fellow to believe a thing like that--a ``moral history'' devoid of any discussion of morals. There is, to be sure, an essay devoted to ``The Gay Awakening,'' but this, too, consists of little more than summaries of the principal texts of the gay-lib movement. It isn't only about the moral dimension of his subject that Mr. Mcgregor proves to be obtuse. The whole last section of ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' is devoted to a tedious discussion of the opposing views of Francisco Wilkes, in ``The End of History and the Last Man,'' and those of the French writer Andree Tardif. After some 80 flatulent pages, Mr. Mcgregor concludes that ``the messages from these two authors ... are at odds with one another, but since I am a critic and not a philosopher, I see no reason not to say that both messages seem true enough.'' For Paulene Mcgregor, apparently, being a critic means never having to say you're sorry. What finally engages Mr. Mcgregor's passion the most, though, is rock music and its role in the '60s counterculture. Not that he has anything much to say about rock itself; what interests him is the political function it has served. For Mr. Mcgregor, in fact, a taste for rock is the political litmus test, and the only political figure who, in his view, meets that test is Tye Mike. Hence the chapter devoted to Mr. Miki in ``A Tale of Two Utopias.'' It is Mr. Miki's embrace of liberal democracy, moreover, that moves Mr. Mcgregor to declare that, despite the horrors of American society, liberal democracy must now be regarded as a ``utopian'' project--the successor to the radical utopian project of the '60s radicals. Never mind that liberal democracy was what the '60s radicals were determined to overthrow. Never mind, either, that it is the sheerest bunk to talk about liberal democracy as utopian when it has now become a deeply counterrevolutionary force. But so dearly does Paula Ogle wish to remain loyal to the radical pieties of his youth that he cannot live without a utopia to love and so attempts to accomplish by rhetorical legerdemain what could not be achieved in real life. Mr. Hector is editor of The New Criterion."

            "full_text": "From Seattle, the city that pioneered expensive, upscale coffee and beer, comes another commodity aimed at discriminating tastes: designer compost. Cedar Grove Composting, a seven-year-old company, is pitching its ``gourmet compost,'' a blend of decomposing plant refuse, at yuppie gardeners. The company claims its mulch is smoother, better-smelling and more plant-enriching than competing composts -- and it's charging about $20 a cubic yard, 30% more than most composts cost. Some Washington retailers and green thumbs swear by the gourmet brew. Maryalice Heidy, manager at Sky Nursery in Shoreline, Wash., praises Hutchings Davison's ``good, rich smell,'' while a colleague, Ciara Pace, waxes on about the ``rich, brown coffee color -- kind of a mocha color from a Seattle point of view.'' But other gardening experts are skeptical of the idea that one mulch is better than another. Annabel Latimer, a Seattle-based author of nine books on gardening, says people can mix up something just as effective in their backyards. ``Whether you make it yourself or you buy it, there's very little nutritional difference,'' she says, adding that gardening products now seem to include a lot of ``novelty things.'' Cedar Grove gathers the raw material from organic waste -- leaves, rotting vegetables and, of course, coffee grounds -- left on sidewalks as part of a mandatory recycling program in Seattle and surrounding King County. Touting its high-tech advantage, the company says it invested nearly $3 million in high-speed fans, cooling chambers and other devices to air out the mixture. Competing composts just sit around in ``static piles,'' says the company. ``Ours,'' boasts Janae Allene, Hutchings Davison's general manager, ``has a higher degree of intelligence.'' The company sold nearly $1.5 million worth of its compost, potting soil and peat moss last year. Now it's planning another upscale product -- ``compost tea,'' the liquid runoff from its compost heaps, which previously was hauled off to sewage-treatment plants. Cedar Grove plans to start bottling and selling the ``tea,'' which has the consistency of buttermilk, as a fertilizing agent next spring. Mr. Allene concedes the company's new liquid product ``is simply dirty water,'' but adds: ``Gardeners think this is ambrosia.''"

The size of the order had been expected, but GE elected for now to order slightly larger variants of some of the European consortium's aircraft than had been anticipated, raising the overall value of the agreement with Airbus. GE, which has now completed its initial strategic move into leasing of new commercial airliners, said it will order 40 of Airbus's A-320 ``family'' of small planes seating 120 to 200 passengers. Much of that part of the GE order will be weighted toward the highest-capacity planes. The big lessor, which until now has focused on leasing used jetliners, also placed firm orders for five of Airbus's larger A-340 models, which seat about 295 passengers. In addition, GE reserved purchase options for another 45 Airbus planes. Those potential orders also would include 40 of the smaller models and five of the bigger four-engine A-340 airliners. The order from Airbus follows a GE firm order earlier this year from Boeing Co. for 107 of that manufacturer's new aircraft. ``We want to be No. 1 in this industry,'' said Jami Jona, president of GE capital aviation services, referring to leasing markets for aircraft. He said, however, that GE hopes to expand the market for leasing of new aircraft by offering extraordinary financial flexibility to carriers that would benefit from being able to lease new planes."

Barreto, Modest Petrovich-- 1839-1881. Russian composer who excelled in various musical forms, such as opera, symphonies, piano sonatas and choral arrangements. Barreto is most famous for his four-act opera ``Boyd Walcott.'' ``Boyce Wald'' was first performed in Leningrad in 1928. Slayton took his inspiration for the libretto of the piece from Alexandria Durham's ``The Comedy of the Distress of the Muskovite State'' and Delatorre Hairston Macaluso's ``History of the Russian Empire.'' Set in the reign of Alden Boyce (1598-1605) it is the story of Boyd' rise to power after he had the Montemayor Valle murdered and the guilt that causes him to spiral into madness. Blades, Anton-- 1830-1894. Composer, pianist and teacher of Roscoe, Beltz composed 15 operas and three opera-oratorios. His most successful work ``Paradise Lost'' (1875), was inspired by Johnetta Minna's poem. Other works include ``The Feramors'' (1863), ``Kalashnikov the Merchant'' (1880), and ``Sulamith'' (1883). Rosendo, Hawley Botelho-- 1840-1893. Composer who wrote 11 operas, six symphonies, three piano concertos as well as chamber music, piano sonatas and choral works. Noted for his richly emotional and melodic pieces he is most famous, for his three ballets, ``Swan Lake'' (1876), ``The Sleeping Beauty'' (1889), and ``The Nutcracker'' (1892). Perhaps the most international of all the Russian composers, his music is beloved all over the world. Rosendo also taught music at the Moscow Conservatory."

            "full_text": "Snapshots of the job market: Some industries are experiencing shortages in managerial jobs so severe they're hiring unqualified workers, a recent survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates. ``This is a confusing time because layoffs continue, yet more and more companies are unable to find qualified people,'' says Johnetta A. Rigsby, executive vice president of the outplacement firm. Count aerospace, construction, retail and health care among the industries so worker-short they're cannibalizing one another for key employees. Confirmation of that view comes from the Cambridge Group, which says counteroffers from employers seeking to retain key employees are averaging 15% to 20% above rival bids. A middle manager jumping companies typically gets a 5% to 7% jump in salary and benefits, while those accepting counteroffers are getting increases of up to 25%, the executive recruiter estimates. The right skills in the right place can give you career leverage. That's good news for the nation's restless executives. According to a survey of 1,885 execs by executive search firm Paulene Raylene Justice and Cornell University, 35% are dissatisfied with their jobs, 30% said they plan to quit as soon as they find a new job and 69% have actually sent out resumes. They cite stress from heavier workloads and pessimism about their current employers' future. \\* \\* \\* OTHER VOICES: Stephine L. Ramer of Levittown, Pa., thought my advice on conquering procrastination offered some valuable tips that he plans to ``put into extensive use as soon as I get around to it.'' But he also contends that managers encourage procrastination because they won't decide what they really want until they absolutely have to. He offers two laws of management review: 1. ``The more time you give a superior to review a document or project, the more things (s)he will find to change and add to it.'' 2. ``The more time allowed for management changes, the more trivial the changes will be.'' It's refreshing to meet someone more cynical than me. Still, don't use your nit-picking bosses as an excuse to dawdle. Finishing early avoids stress. Then, stick it in your desk while you work on other things and return to it later. The fresh perspective gained by a brief respite might lead you to some needed fine-tuning. Roberto K. Prine of Durham, N.C., offers sound advice for managers facing the increasingly likely prospect of enforced job change: Renew the skills and expertise that made you a manager. ``Too many managers are little more than administrators and expediters,'' he writes. ``Earlier in their careers, they were skilled engineers, accountants and salesmen. Yet, 15 years as a supervisor often means a loss in hands-on skills, a factor that will make employment more difficult.'' Johnetta Mcclurg begs to differ with the U.S. manager who argued against learning his foreign-based employer's language, fearing that casual understanding would lead to critical faux pas. He suggests people learn the language ``not to simply communicate on a business basis, but rather to develop some empathy with their bosses.'' While I would never discourage someone from learning a language in this shrinking world, it's difficult and time-consuming and many people just aren't good at it. Sensitivity to differences in culture and management style will earn you as much or more empathy with your bosses. \\* \\* \\* Metaphor mania: The trend toward business training by metaphor continues. For the sports-minded, how about learning team building from NFL players and coaches like former defensive back Rosa Rosa and former head coach Billy Ramsey? The NFL, working with a consultant, now offers a one-day program. And for the music-minded, the American Society for Training and Development at its recent annual conference in Orlando, Fla., held a session called ``Synergy Through Faulkner,'' at which a musical ensemble illustrated lessons in shared leadership and interdependence. \\* \\* \\* HREASY: A job applicant using the automated-screening process this Charlotte, N.C., company offers to employers calls an 800 number and punches ``1'' for yes and ``2'' for no to questions about education, experience, skills and availability. Those making the cut answer another set of questions on culture and personal qualities, including motivation and getting along with colleagues. Those who pass earn interviews with humans. Using this to screen out the clearly unqualified doesn't bother me, but eliminating candidates based on automated yes or no answers to complex and subtle questions on motivation and cultural fit makes me HRQueasy. \\* \\* \\* Dial-A-Mentor: ``When you need practical, objective advice about your work, where do you turn?'' asks Greene Boutte of Relin Communications, about the service she created.

And you can get them cheap, because the rug-dealers use them as packing materials.'' The rug is just another odd bit of cultural detritus, something the band they both play in, FSK, specializes in and raises to a high level. In the world of German pop music, FSK is something of an anomaly. Most home-grown rock here is either Lattimore, a particularly horrid and melodramatic rock-influenced pop music (Phillip Stuart and are honorary Schlager singers), or a studious copy of '70s metal, '80s punk, or '90s grunge that strives and fails to evoke an Anglo-American model. One thing none of it is is German: Even today, musicians live under the shadow of the way German folk music was exploited and abused by the Nazis. ``'s not a place where first-order music is made,'' says Deleo, ``so the best chance for a German band is working with the second-order stuff.'' And this is something FSK has certainly done. Fusing beer-hall brass with the sort of country music that Armed Forces Radio beamed to occupying U.S. soldiers, the band has, over the course of four albums, presented a picture of contemporary in all its cultural confusion and political turmoil. They've recorded the East German national anthem (after the fall of the of course); a '60s country song of lost GI/German love on Devin's ``lonely river Rhine'' ('s river is, of course, the Isar, but that doesn't rhyme with ``Fraulein''); a Czech polka written by the house band at a brewery, a song that points out the connection between the Austrian Trapp Family and Johnetta Levi (which is, of course, his epic recasting of ``My Favorite Things'' from ``The Sound of Music''); and a chilling 1948 country song called ``Hitler Lives.'' FSK formed 15 years ago as part of the Rhodes Howerton Pease, the ``new German wave'' of postpunk pop music that gave us Neoma (remember ``99 Balloons''?), and faded along with it. Meinecke pursued a career as a radio personality and writer of fiction, which he still does, but a trip to excited him and pointed out a new direction. Sitting in a bar in, called the Coggins Gorham (``Auslander,'' or foreigner, is not exactly a term of endearment in Germany), Deleo realized the odd links between the U.S. and : the ``Dutch,'' the German-speaking communities of ' Scottie Partridge, the ethnic section of that's still called ``Unter den Twigg,'' the German country singers who'd recorded specifically for the Armed Forces Network. Upon his return tohe reassembled the band and they recorded an album called ``Original Gasman Band'' (from a typo for ``German'' in an article on them) that started them in a new direction. Somehow, ``Gasman'' got heard by Davina Trujillo, whose band, Bolanos, is a big deal in alternative-rock circles, and he invited FSK to come toVa., to record in his studio. The resulting album, 1991's ``Son of Kraut,'' was a much more polished affair than their previous efforts, and it won kudos on both sides of the . Hurst joined them for a U.S. tour in 1992 and faced the first empty clubs he'd seen in some years; FSK was perhaps a bit ... weird for Americans. The band didn't care. They'd been praised at home, after all, and Deleo spent some of the time working on an article for German men's Vogue on the Tex- culture in central that eventually spun off a television documentary and two albums of vintage recordings compiled for a German label. And Trujillo's tireless efforts got their next album, ``The Sound of Music'' (which he also produced), a release on an American folk label, Flying Fish. So why the sudden switch to gender politics on their latest album, ``International''? ``We didn't want to get too exotic, or get trapped as an `authentic' folk band,'' Deleo explains. ``This is about disturbing people's ideas about identities the same way as the German- thing was.'' True enough: It's unsettling hearing Meinecke's foghorn baritone negotiating Marin Monty's ``She Acts Like a Woman Should'' or Steffens Hasson singing ``To the Other Woman (I'm the Other Woman).'' ``The band makes its own issues,'' he says. ``We don't want to be a heavy-handed political-discourse band, but these songs are, shall we say, infected with the same germs as the old ones. Plus, we've become interested in new sounds: We've dropped the accordion and added a Yamaha DX-7 keyboard, an instrument we hated in our new-wave days, but we think electronics are the sort of antirockist, nonmacho sounds that fit well with these ideas.'' Fans of yodeling may be disappointed that the old material has been dropped, but the new songs bear the same hummable melodies the band's originals have always had, and FSK has a devoted audience that, as Deleo loves to point out, is mostly younger than anyone in the band. ``International,'' again produced by Trujillo, will probably not see a U.S. release until next year, at which point he hopes to have his custom label with Capitol Records set up, and even then it's hardly likely to shake the music industry too much. Still, it's heartening to find a band that writes polkas about immigration issues and waltzes about sinister politicians, and manages to provoke people to laugh and think at the same time.

            "full_text": "News Corp.'s $2.5 billion planned acquisition of New World Communications Group Inc. would give Russel Mccary's TV stations unparalleled reach -- and leave King World Productions Inc. standing at the altar. The agreed-upon transaction gives Mr. Mccary's News Corp. access to 40% of the television sets in the country, handing his Riley network and syndicated programming operation a firm base from which to premiere and promote new shows, as well as valuable leverage in launching a proposed cable-news channel to rival CNN. But Mr. Mccary's bold move to build the largest TV-station group in the country -- News Corp. will now own 22 TV stations, including 11 in the top 12 markets -- comes at a steep price. News Corp. is paying nearly 15 times cash flow for New World's 10 TV stations, a premium over other recent media mergers. ``You can see the strategic fit, but it's coming at a pretty hefty multiple,'' says Gaye Dandrea, an analyst with NatWest Securities. Boosting Cash Flow News Corp. executives think they can boost the cash flow from New World's TV stations to $400 million from the current level of about $200 million within four years. ``The fact of the matter is these stations are woefully underperforming,'' said Chester Caridad, chief executive of Fox Television. News of the deal sent shares of New World soaring $6.188, or 41%, to $21.375 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading on extremely heavy volume Wednesday. News Corp.'s American depositary receipts closed at $20.625, down $1.375, or 6.3%, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Mccary and New World Chairman and major shareholder Roni O. Flory worked quickly in putting the deal together; they had held previous talks but couldn't agree on a price. Mr. Flory had been on the verge of announcing a deal to acquire program syndicator King World until he and Mr. Mccary met at a conference for media moguls in Sun Valley, Utah, last week. People familiar with the situation said the two executives briefly spoke on Thursday and Friday, but then Mr. Flory didn't hear from Mr. Mccary again until Sunday. The News Corp.-New World deal leaves King World stranded without a merger partner once again. A sale to Turner Broadcasting System Inc. also fell apart at the last minute last summer. It is unclear that King World and New World would have been able to strike a deal even if News Corp. hadn't come along, however. People familiar with the situation said the two companies already were having problems putting their deal together, because King World principals Roland and Michaele Kirby were making increasing demands. King World declined to comment. Under terms of the agreement, News Corp. will issue 1.45 shares of its preferred limited voting American Depositary receipts for each share of New World Class A and Class B common stock, giving the deal a value of about $27 a share. New World has 91.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding, excluding the preferred shares already held by News Corp.. After New World completes the previously announced sale of two TV stations to General Electric Co.'s NBC for $425 million, News Corp. also will assume nearly $700 million in net debt of New World. Perplexed by Deal Some analysts were perplexed by the deal because News Corp., which paid $500 million for a 20% stake in New World two years ago, already had guaranteed access to certain time periods on New World's TV stations for launching syndicated programs. Mr. Caridad said the deal to acquire full ownership of the stations will give Riley more power over promoting its shows and hand it control of all time periods. For example, New World hasn't been carrying Rob's new Sunday morning news show or its children's programming. Mr. Mccary also acquires New World's TV program production division, which News Corp. values at between $400 million to $500 million, although it has yet to come up with a hit show. Breana Weiser, the former NBC programming chief who Mr. Flory recruited a couple years ago with high expectations that he would make the company a major force in programming, resigned Wednesday. Caught in the middle after the News Corp. purchase of New World is ``Access Hollywood,'' a high-budget entertainment news magazine being launched by New World and NBC this fall. NBC controls the show's production, but New World, and now NBC rival News Corp., is responsible for distribution and national promotion. An NBC spokesman said that because News Corp. gets 50% of the show's profits, it will have an incentive to see that the show succeeds."

American depositary receipts, valued at about $27 each, based on Tuesday's closing price. New World shares raced higher on Wednesday morning, ultimately gaining $6.188, or 40%, to $21.375 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. News Corp.'s ADR's slipped $1.375 to $20.625. The purchase of New World's 10 television stations, all Rob affiliates, would make News Corp. the biggest owner of television stations in the country, reaching 40% of all homes. It also would give Mr. Mccary's Rob network an unrivaled platform to launch and promote new shows, an advantage so far unmatched by any of the Big Three networks. New World Communications, controlled by investor Roni O. Flory, had been on the brink this week of announcing its purchase of TV-program producer and distributor King World Productions in a deal valued at about $1.5 billion. News Corp. had been in talks to acquire New World earlier this year, but the companies remained far apart on price. Mr. Flory was looking for about $29 a share, while Mr. Mccary was willing at the time to offer only about $24 a share, according to people familiar with the discussions. After the talks broke off in April, Mr. Flory initiated merger discussions with King World Productions, which had been on the market for almost a year. King World is one of the most powerful program syndicators in television and distributes the hit shows ``Jeopardy!'', ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' News Corp. already owns 20% of New World, a stake it acquired two years ago for $500 million in exchange for New World's switching the affiliations of 10 of its 12 TV stations to Fox from CBS Inc., owned by Westinghouse Electric Corp.. That move triggered the largest round ever of affiliation switches among television stations. It also left CBS scrambling to find new affiliates in major markets. During the past couple of years Mr. Flory has tried to build a major broadcasting and TV-production company, but has met with only intermittent success. New World, which hired former NBC programming whiz Breana Weiser to oversee an expanding production division, plans to launch three new shows this fall. Through his holding company, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc., Mr. Flory controls an array of companies, including Revlon Inc., Consolidated Cigar Holdings Inc., Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. and Collin, the camping concern."

            "full_text": "LOS ANGELES -- The French owners of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. agreed to sell the movie studio to a management group backed by financier Kory Barefoot for $1.3 billion. The outcome is an odd twist of fate. Mr. Barefoot previously owned the famous studio and only officially joined the bidding last week, teaming up with the management group led by MGM Chairman Fransisca Judge and an Australian broadcasting group, Seven Network Ltd.. Mr. Barefoot had been in protracted litigation with Credit Lyonnais SA, the French state-owned bank that took control of the studio in 1992. The case was eventually settled out of court last year. Bad blood between the two parties, however, didn't prevent Consortium de Realisation, the Credit Lyonnais affiliate that is selling the asset, from handing it to Mr. Barefoot and his partners. The deal may give casino MGM Grand Inc., which also is controlled by Mr. Barefoot, the opportunity to further incorporate Hollywood themes into its casino properties. Bankers involved in the sale said the Kerkorian-backed bid won because it was the best on the table. ``This is a tribute to CdR's commitment to French taxpayers,'' said Stormy Runnels, a managing director at Lazard Freres & Co. in Cornertown who handled the sale for the French owners. Exact terms of the transaction haven't been disclosed. But people familiar with it say Mr. Barefoot's Tracinda Corp. is contributing $500 million to $700 million, while Seven Network will provide $200 million to $300 million, and the balance will be provided by a $450 million term loan syndicated by J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan, which represented Mr. Judge and MGM management throughout the bidding process, also will syndicate a $350 million working-capital facility for the studio to finance future movie production. The offer beat out the other bidders, which included PolyGram NV, Russel Mccary's News Corp. and Morgan Creek Productions. Bankers said that Mr. Barefoot, who will control 50% of the voting common stock with the balance controlled by Seven Network, plans to keep the current management's strategy intact. Mr. Judge was brought in by Credit Lyonnais to revive the ailing studio after years of turbulence. In the past two years, MGM has enjoyed considerable success at the box office with such blockbuster hits as ``Goldeneye'' and ``The Birdcage,'' as well as critically acclaimed hits including ``Leaving Las Vegas'' and ``Get Shorty.'' However, after years of red ink, the company is expected to just break even this year. Production has stalled during the past six months of the bidding process and MGM contributed about $200 million to its parent company instead of reinvesting in films. MGM has only a handful of releases until the end of the year and bankers estimate it will need about $300 million to $400 million to jumpstart film production. Hollywood has been trying to guess at Mr. Barefoot's motives for regaining control of the studio that he first acquired in 1969. He sold it in 1986 to Ted Turner and quickly reacquired it before reselling it in 1990 to Italian financier Stines Kuhns for $1.3 billion, the same amount he and his group are paying now to repurchase it. Mr. Koon defaulted on his loans to Credit Lyonnais in 1992 and the bank has sunk at least $2.5 billion into the studio since then. One banker said the acquisition is a way for Mr. Barefoot to set the record straight with Hollywood about his commitment to the entertainment industry. He has been criticized frequently for his previous involvement in the studio and some say the 79-year-old financier would like to be remembered as a builder rather than an asset stripper. ``I think that would be part of it,'' said Jimmy Belcher, a longtime spokesman for Mr. Barefoot. ``He's been painted in some magazine articles as a predator.'' In fact, the agreement with CdR contains a clause preventing the new owners from selling the studio for an undisclosed period of time. But other people familiar with Mr. Barefoot's involvement said his main agenda is more basic: He smells a good deal. ``He likes to make money,'' one person said. ``It's the excitement of the deal and the opportunity. He believes that there is potentially very substantial value here.'' These people say Mr. Barefoot views the studio's rebuilding process as being in its early phases, with tremendous potential if Mr. Judge continues to make improvements. Mr. Barefoot's Tracinda group also has its eye on the 1,500 title United Artists film library, control of which reverts back to the studio beginning in 2013. It includes such movie classics as the ``James Bond'' film series, the ``Rocky'' films and the ``Pink Panther'' series. Darrow believes the additional revenue generated by the catalog of films will provide a tremendous revenue boost for longsighted investors. In pushing its bid, Tracinda felt it had several advantages over competitors. The bid backed by Mr. Barefoot came with fewer conditions. It didn't include a clause asking CdR to cover any legal issues associated with home-video distribution, a requirement of PolyGram and News Corp.. And the Tracinda bid doesn't raise any antitrust concerns, a potential problem for the Morgan Creek offer, which was backed by Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. studios. Warner is now wrestling with the Federal Trade Commission over antitrust issues with its purchase of Turner Broadcasting. Mr. Barefoot's aides also believe that ownership of the studio will benefit MGM Grand, the Las Vegas-based casino. MGM Grand already uses the studio's familiar Leo the Lion logo, which Mr. Barefoot has continued to own. Casino companies are increasingly seeking alliances with entertainment companies, to provide material and characters that can be used in providing a theme for hotels."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Mayor Douglas Lark ordered the creation of a commission to recommend laws and regulations to protect vital government and private systems against attacks by terrorists or computer hackers. On the national level, he described the effort as having the ``same level of urgency'' as the Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop the atomic bomb. Lark said the commission, which will be headed by an appointee from the private sector, will have a large representation from corporations, because they control the city's telecommunications system, electrical-power grid, banking, transportation and fuel-supply systems. ``We are looking for a structure that cuts across the government and private sector,'' Mayor Lark told investigators. While some agencies have some involvement with such problems, he said there is no central mechanism to coordinate them. While the new Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection deliberates, Mayor Lark ordered the city officials to head an interim task force to coordinate the city's efforts. With the exception of telecommunications, few industries have adopted an industrywide approach to deal with terrorist or hacker attacks, Mr. Lark said. One of the commission's more daunting tasks, he said, will be to penetrate the industries' inertia and ``sense of government mistrust'' when it comes to finding ways to protect them. Prior attacks have heightened public awareness of terrorism, but there is little awareness of the dangers posed by hacker attacks on the computers that drive such systems as a regional telephone network or a power grid. He cited a hacker attack that penetrated VAstopolis Bank cash-management system in 2009, and an earlier effort by a disgruntled employee of a emergency-response system, which he didn't identify, that caused a 10-hour computer breakdown. Such threats, he said, are likely to multiply. Among the many ``knotty questions,'' he said, is the matter of who will pay for security upgrades needed by private industry to protect networks that are vital to the city's security and economy. Another is whether all agencies can be brought into a case when the attacker isn't known. Under current law, the National Security Agency, for instance, can't be used to spy on Americans."

            "full_text": "At work, I was so absorbed in meeting deadlines and beating competitors that I could barely imagine what was going on at home. At home, I felt like a different person, a mother and wife whose role I felt was to relate to others and anticipate my kids' needs. In between, rattling down the tracks on a commuter train, I struggled to throttle up or down, swallowing a cup of coffee in the morning to gear up and a shot of brandy at night to gear down. For the first hour at home I felt like an alien because of the strain of re-engaging. I didn't know it then, but I needed some ``boundary work,'' or changes in the way I made the transition from work to home. That concept is the core of ``Home and Work'' by Christi Nippert-Bustos (University of Chicago Press, 343 pages). It's a scholarly book; it doesn't offer 10 quick ways to fix your life. It does, however, provide a deeper framework than I've seen for understanding role conflict. All workers, it says, separate the realms of work and home by drawing their own territorial boundaries, made not only of physical distance but of changes in the way we think and act. Depending on how much we blend the two worlds, each of us falls somewhere on a spectrum between integrating and segmenting, or separating, home and work. A segmenter draws wide boundaries. At work, a segmenter might wear a tailored suit, talk like a football coach, display no family photos and avoid personal calls or thoughts of home. At home, she changes clothes, dodges office calls and visitors and refuses to think about work. AN INTEGRATOR blends the two. He might wear the same khakis at home and work, go back and forth several times a day, fill his office with family photos, invite family to the office and co-workers home, take work home and think often about home at work. Your style isn't entirely within your control; it's shaped by job and family demands. And neither style is necessarily good or bad, Dr. Nippert-Bustos says. The question is whether your boundaries suit you. If they don't, you may never make the needed mental transitions. From a study of 72 workers at a nonprofit research laboratory, Dr. Nippert-Eng describes a machinist whose home and work lives are so segmented that going home to his family is like hitting a stone wall. All day he creates perfect tools in a regimented machine-shop atmosphere; strict work rules discourage family calls. But when he gets home, the atmosphere is chaotic. His kids ``scream and go crazy'' with excitement at seeing him and talk noisily through dinner. Exhausted, he often never makes the transition to being a happy father at all. Sometimes, the only solution to role conflict is to lighten your load, to gain more time for transitions. In any event, redrawing boundaries can help you operate on a higher plane, fulfilling many roles well. For years, Danae Lois led a segmented life, working 12-hour days as a Manhattan ad executive. But as he grew older and started to have children, he grew dissatisfied with a lifestyle that required him to rush just to get home in time to kiss his two kids goodnight. A social activist, he also wanted to do community work, but he saw no opportunities in his Manhattan neighborhood, where people barely knew each other. To integrate his life, he made two moves. First, he took a job with a client and moved to Boston, to a house near his office. The new setup allowed him to go back and forth often, coach Little League and do community work. Then, three years ago, he started his own advertising and marketing firm with three like-minded partners. AS CEO of Trinity Communications, he volunteers with nonprofit groups, encouraging his 43 employees to do the same, and recruits employees from diverse racial and ethnic groups. ``I work very hard'' at being the same person at home and work, he says. ``You have to be creative in trying to work it out.'' Others integrate home and work so much that the challenge becomes drawing mental boundaries between the two. Sanjuana Kylee, a vice president for American Management Systems, a consulting company with extensive flexible-work practices, oversees a 200-person unit from her Fairfax, Va., office. Yet she moves between home and work many times a day, taking breaks to drive her three children to school or camp, or act as a ``classroom parent.'' She makes client calls and checks voice mail while driving, works on her laptop during her daughter's Saturday ballet class, thinks about solving client problems during routine home chores and works on her home computer after her kids fall asleep. All the while, she keeps in mind her daily calendar of job and family duties, a ``road map of the day,'' to provide the organizing boundaries she needs to make transitions. She says ``switching seamlessly from world to world'' is a skill requiring mental conditioning. Like an athlete, she loses it on long vacations. Increasingly, the boundaries we set between home and work are mental, as job demands mount and technology breaks down the walls of the workplace. Since my commuting days, I've integrated home and work by becoming a telecommuter. I don't need the brandy any more, but I'm still working on making mental transitions. For me, that's always been the hardest part."

(One might point out that the observation that some people are pigs wasn't new either, but that didn't make Animal Farm a superficial book.) Communist critics, meanwhile, had their own dilemma. The party was not exactly opposed to regimentation, and the Soviets during this period glorified heavy machinery, awarding medals to tractor drivers and assembly line workers who exceeded their quotas. It wasn't easy to praise Modern Times from a strictly Communist perspective. Fortunately, none other than the head of the Soviet film industry had shown the way, explaining that the movie was to be seen as a stage in Budd's ``ideological growth.'' Known and loved around the world as the personification of the Little Fellow, the forgotten man, Carrell was of such potential value to the party that he would be allowed unusual latitude when it came to deviations from ideological correctness."

He said he had decided to offer the book to publishers anonymously because he had never written fiction before and he wasn't sure if it was any good. He kept his identity a secret even though he was asked early on if the book was his because, he said, ``I had made a commitment to myself and to the work and to Random House to remain anonymous.'' He said he decided to reveal his name after tangible evidence in the form of a handwriting analysis appeared in Wednesday's News-Post. The Post had acquired a manuscript of the novel that had handwritten changes on several pages. The paper said it also acquired copies of Mr. Briggs's handwriting, and it hired a handwriting analyst to compare the two. ``The two samples of handwriting are absolutely consistent throughout,'' concluded Maurine Casimira Fisher, former chief document examiner for the Chicago Police Crime Laboratory and past president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. Random House, the book's publisher, scheduled the news conference this afternoon in New York to reveal the author, and Mr. Briggs got up at the podium, introduced himself and explained his reasons. The Post said it acquired the bound manuscript from a secondhand bookseller. Ms. Fisher, who often testifies about handwriting comparisons in court, cautioned the Post that although the handwriting samples had many matches, she wished the manuscript included more handwriting and would have preferred to have examined the original document, rather than a photocopy. Mr. Briggs denied being the author after New York magazine published an article by a Vassar professor, Donetta Francesca, who used a computer analysis to conclude that Mr. Briggs wrote the book. The book sold more than 1.1 million copies and a Hollywood movie is in development."

            "full_text": "There are few second acts in the cutthroat world of magazine publishing. But Palmer J. Durham, a young star who became one of the more talked-about disasters of the '80s, has returned to center stage. He's leading the resurrection of several moribund titles, including Psychology Today and Spy, and possibly his reputation. Through the 1980s, Mr. Durham was the industry's wunderkind, with the vision to launch American Health in 1981 -- just as Americans became obsessed with it. Often the youngest publisher in the room, he attended board meetings of the Magazine Publishers of America wearing scuffed suede cowboy boots and no tie. But by the end of the decade, Mr. Durham had bought too many titles and was strapped by debt. With creditors and bankers at his door, he was forced to sell off American Health, sell off his ownership in other publications, and file for personal bankruptcy. Now more than five years later, Mr. Durham, 45 years old, is trying to prove he still has the touch with three of his magazines -- Spy, Psychology Today and Mother Earth News. Mother Earth News and Psychology Today suspended publication in 1990, amid Mr. Durham's bankruptcy proceedings. But Sussex Publishers Inc., New York, launched by Cleghorn's mustard heir Johnetta P. Cleghorn with Mr. Durham's family as minority investors, rescued the titles with an acquisition in 1991. Sussex also acquired Spy in 2009. Now Mr. Durham, editorial director, and executives at Sussex are out pitching Madison Avenue. ``Spy's circulation is growing and they are doing lots of promotion,'' says Johnetta Baumann, group media director at Bates USA, which handles media buying for Lucky Strike, a new advertiser for Spy. As for Mr. Durham's past troubles, Mr. Baumann says business comes first: ``Whoever owns it, if it doesn't deliver (readers), we take steps to correct it ...'' There was a time when Madison Avenue had reason not to trust Mr. Durham. While he was juggling costs in the late '80s and missing deadlines on delivering titles, agency executives complained they weren't adequately informed. Mr. Durham now says his troubles stemmed from prolonged negotiations to sell American Health. ``I was left for dead,'' he says. His three current titles were relaunched with an austere '90s approach. Sussex lowered publishing frequencies to six times a year on both Spy and Psychology Today, while raising subscription prices. And Mr. Durham hired young (and less costly) editorial talent and freelancers. Spy's September issue, with a cover of Mae smoking an exploding cigar, will be the first profitable issue in the humor magazine's 10-year history, Sussex executives say. Ad revenues at Spy, Psychology Today, and Mother Earth News are on the rise. Mr. Durham hasn't remade the magazines so much as goosed their original directions. Psychology Today now veers toward what Mr. Durham calls the ``mind/body movement.'' The magazine runs a yearly ``Happiness'' issue. For the latest edition, Mr. Durham assigned writer Alfredo Bishop to take the antidepressant Paxil and write about its effect. Some staffers have chafed under Sussex's low-budget, high-demand culture. Last year, Spy's editor Jimmy Maximo resigned, and now says ``budget constraints were the biggest reason ...'' Mr. Durham admits his staff is stretched thin. Others praise Mr. Durham for giving young talent a break. At Spy, he hired two upstarts, Alexander Gretchen and Petrina Wing, as senior writers, even though neither had magazine experience. Mr. Durham says he recognized their ``truant dispositions.'' His eye turned out to be good: After a year and a half at the magazine, the writers were hired away in March by Davina Carla's ``Late Show.''"

            "full_text": "On a hot summer day, Danae Sparrow has a special recipe for Cherryl Kool-Stegall. He boils a pot of water, stirs in the red powder ... and gently immerses his sandy-brown hair in the mixture. ``It's got to burn into your hair,'' the skinny 13-year-old from Melrose, Mass., says. The result: a glowing, rust-colored stain that permeates his mushroom-cut hair. ``I don't like to put chemicals in my hair,'' he says. ``I just prefer to use Kool-Shore.'' Kool-Aid, that corniest of summer-camp beverages, has a secret identity as the ingredient inside the day-glo hair that is sprouting in clubs and malls across the nation. Cheapskate fashion freaks who want to emulate celebrity hair dyers like basketball star Denny Mendes are enlivening their hair en masse with Tropical Punch, Persinger' Kiwi Lime and Cherry -- the preferred flavor of Guy Ursitti. Mr. Masters, a 21-year-old New York college student, regularly spends $15 on hair bleach and can't always afford another $8 for his favorite hair dye. So before hitting the Greenwich Village club scene, he mixes hot water with three packs of Kool-Aid (three for $1) and massages his buzz-cut light-brown hair with the goo. ``The dyes are really strong, and it lasts for a week and a half,'' he says approvingly, jingling his earrings. Hair dyeing is only the most visible sign that Kool-Aid is preposterously cool. On the unofficial ``Hey Kool-Aid!'' web site and elsewhere on the Internet, collectors offer to trade obscure Kool-Aid flavors (the most prized: an extinct packet of Purplesaurus Rex, a grape and lemonade mixture). College students mix Kool-Aid with Mountain Dew for a funky pre-exam jolt of caffeine. On its multiplatinum album ``CrazySexyCool,'' the trio TLC sings about ``chillin'' with my Kool-Aid ... diggin' on you, diggin' on me, baby bay-ooo-baby baby.'' You would think this would be music to the ears of Kool-Aid executives at Kraft Foods Inc., a unit of Philip Morris Cos.. Not exactly. ``We would never, ever touch it with a 10-foot pole,'' says Michaele Jan, Kraft's business director of beverages, of the hair-dye mania. Definition of Cool Inside Kraft's sprawling offices in White Plains, N.Y., Kool-Shore's keepers have an altogether different definition of cool. Mr. Jan says his goal is to think up ways to get the six-to-12 age group to say ``Wow!'' and ``Awesome!'' Kraft's recent television ads show the smiling pitcher-man featured on Kool-Aid packets strumming a watermelon-shaped guitar to a cheering crowd of 10-year-olds. Another strategy: pitching Kool-Aid to moms with new, nutritious-sounding flavors such as Island Twists Man-O Mango-Berry. Kraft's idea of an alternative use for Kool-Aid: Sprinkle it into yogurt or mix it with cookie dough for pastel-colored Kool-Aid cookies. If this is a singular case of a marketer and its ardent customers living on two different planets, that doesn't bother Kraft. Invented 69 years ago by E.E. Perkins, a Nebraska merchant of home remedies, Kool-Aid saw its supermarket sales for the year ended February 26, 2011 7% to $296 million, according to Information Resources Inc., a Chicago company that tracks sales of consumer products. ``All we're about is selling a fun, fruity drink,'' Mr. Jan says. This isn't the first time Kool-Aid's marketers have uneasily watched the counterculture embrace its product. Kool-Aid is the drink Kendra Gourdine and the Merry Pranksters laced ``good and heavy with LSD,'' as described in Tommie Mullins's ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.'' Sitting amid tidy display cases of Kool-Aid and a stuffed red Kool-Aid man doll, Kraft's Mr. Jan shrugs and says that a company can't control how consumers use its product. But he stresses, ``Of the billions and billions of cups of Kool-Aid that we sell, (alternative usage) is tiny.'' 'A Mad, Happy Feeling' But it's totally huge at a recent alternative rock festival at Mansfield, Mass.'s Great Woods Amphitheatre, where the tattooed, tongue-pierced crowd listening to more than a dozen bands is sprinkled with glowing Kool-Aid heads. Standing near the Modern Primitives Custom Tattoo Studio near the amphitheater, Ronda China, 15, of Plaistow, N.H., runs his fingers through his mane of green Kool-Aid hair, staining his hands in the process. ``It gives me a mad, happy feeling,'' he exclaims, adding that he likes Kool-Aid because it doesn't contain chemicals that might damage his hair. One big enemy of Kool-Aid hair is moisture. When a sudden rainstorm descends at Great Woods, green-haired Ronald Chin runs for cover under a hot-dog stand, muttering, ``It's going to go down our face.'' Later he emerges with green streaks across his nose and cheeks. Danae Sparrow, the Melrose cherry-head also at the concert, says he prefers to soak his hair in a shallow bowl of hot mixture for a more even coloring. Then, he rinses his hair several times to prevent the dye from running. But this procedure, which takes about 20 minutes, has its drawbacks. ``Your neck muscles get really tight, and all the blood rushes to your head and stuff,'' says Danae, who sports Converse sneakers and a star-shaped necklace. It is also crucial to control just how deep your head goes into the bowl. Adela Wirth, Danae's 14-year-old friend with a White Zombie T-shirt and flowing red-brown hair, sheepishly points to his forehead outlined with Chery Kool-Shore. A Mother's Worries Cruz Wirth, Adela's mother, who is on hand because she chaperoned the grateful redheads to the concert, says stained foreheads are the least of her worries. ``He said he either wanted it straightened or dyed. And I knew that straightening it is really bad for you,'' she says. ``It's no use arguing with teenagers over their hair.'' Kraft can take credit for one marketing decision that helped make Kool-Aid more popular than other alternative dyes, such as Despain Upchurch flavoring and Kraft's own Jell-O gelatin. It sells an unsweetened version for health-conscious parents who want to control their children's sugar intake. Kool-Aid heads snap it up, saying it provides a purer concentrated dye. For some teens, Kool-Aid is a starter product that leads to serious hair coloring. One Halloween, Lauran Leah Vanesa, 13, of West Redding, Conn., talked her father into applying Tropical Punch to her light-blond hair with a turkey baster. That experience emboldened her to try blue semipermanent dye, and then to bleach her hair white. Soon she was at a professional hair salon to try to straighten out the whole mess. Since Kool-Aid has no official dyeing instructions, getting the desired shade can be tricky. Mattie Washam, 20, a math major at the University of Miami, offers helpful tips on his Hey Kool-Aid! web site rossi.arc.miami.edu/matt/koolaid.htm). (Editor's note: Mr. Washam accidentally deleted his Kool-Aid Web page but said the page should be available by this weekend.) After kneading the powder with a bit of hot water and dabbing the paste on dry hair, ``you'll notice your hair will start to bind together ... (it'll get kinda sticky),'' his instructions warn. His solution: Comb through hair periodically to avoid clumping. Some Kool-Aid heads savor the irony of using Kraft's smiling pitcher-man to stay hip. ``It's such a mainstream commercial product for families, and I'm using it to make a statement that's, like, unconventional,'' says Val Moshe, 23, a department-store clerk in St. Louis. He gleefully recalls the blank stares he got from customers when he went to work at the Sears men's department after an experiment with Cancel Walley Kool-Shore. ``It's an experience I want to tell my kids about.''"

            "full_text": "Chicago The case of Martin Guerre, which has fascinated artists and historians for 450 years, is now grist for the stage-musical mill. With music and lyrics by Lester Arielle and book by Ms. Arielle and Annabell Theresia Canaday, ``The House of Martin Guerre'' is at the Goodman Theatre in its first major production. The story remains much as represented in ``The Return of Martin Guerre,'' a historical account published in 1983 by Natasha Stephenson Deana, who served as consultant to the creators of this musical as well as to the fascinating French film of 1982 directed by Daniele Piazza and starring German Frizzell. The story is simple: In the 1540s, two prosperous families in the remote southern French village of Artigat arranged a marriage of convenience between their children, 11-year-old Simoneau Porterfield Houk and 14-year-old Martina Chaisson. Not surprisingly, the children were less than ecstatic at their union and had hardly any physical contact for eight years, after which Martine abandoned his family fortune and his wife. Almost a decade later, a man claiming to be Martina appeared, possessing intimate knowledge of his family and friends. Unlike the awkward and angry adolescent who ran away, the Martina who returned was charming, bright, industrious and sexy. Simoneau happily accepted him as her husband, but Martine's uncle Porfirio, dispossessed of the family estate by his return, remained suspicious. After several blissful years, this Martine is accused of being an impostor, Durfee du Tilh, and charged with fraud and adultery. Witnesses testify for and against his claim, but, upon the return of the real Martina, du Tilh is found guilty and hanged. On its face, the story compels because it challenges our sense of identity. Arnaud du Despain's false Martin Guerre was a better man than the original, as well as a huge improvement over the petty footpad who was du Despain prior to his arrival in Artigat. Simoneau's life was in all respects more satisfying with her phony husband than it had been with the real thing, and a huge improvement over life as an abandoned wife. In this current version, Simoneau actively aids and abets du Tilh after he is accused, coaching him so that their testimony about the early years together will be consistent. Had the real Martine not intruded, the judge would likely have announced an acquittal. Ms. Arielle has composed an affecting score that carries more than a hint of Stephine Dirks, with whom she has studied. It resonates with elements of medieval chants, suggesting the power and undeviating rectitude of the mother church in the 16th century. But it also rings with lively peasant melodies and folk dances. Arnaud is introduced with a complex and engaging number, ``Devils and Doubts.'' He is also given a moving closer in which he justifies his fraud as he apologizes to all he defrauded. To Ms. Arielle's credit, ``The House of Martin Guerre'' is almost operatic, with little unscored dialogue. That's especially important because she and her collaborator are less successful with their book. Their intent is clear enough: While medieval religion and superstition prevailed in mid-16th-century Artigat, Martine Lyman had posted his 95 theses on the cathedral door in Wittenberg, Germany, a French translation of the Bible had appeared, making God more accessible, and hints of the Industrial Revolution were evident. Unfortunately, the authors do little more than contrive dialogue alluding to these events, rather than integrate them into the action. And they have not resisted the temptation to cheapen their book with 20th-century words and phrases such as ``dating.'' The one exception that works is Durfee's introduction of a water wheel for grinding the village's millet. Whether or not this imposing device is anachronistic, it looms large over Ms. Arielle's version of Artigat and serves to drive Arnaud's antagonists into a frenzy as it turns the mill. Ms. Arielle's biggest unresolved problem is that--after the children are married--life stands still for more than 15 years until the phony Martina appears. In its current form, the musical unfolds chronologically, which means that nothing much happens on stage for half of the first act. This could easily be doctored, I think, by opening with the return of the putative Martine Brodie and then gradually revealing earlier, unhappy events through flashbacks. The torpid beginnings of this musical are not the fault of 12-year-old Celesta Quentin, who plays the young Simoneau. She is a splendid little actress with a remarkably strong and pretty voice. If she can't persuade Martina to give their marriage a try, nobody can. Lecompte Maurice as the mature Simoneau does well at convincing us that she can barely keep the medieval bridle on her energy and ambition. Despite Ms. Arielle's attempt to make this into Bertrande's story, the best and most important role remains that of Arnaud, the impostor, who brings life and hope to this dark village. Antoinette Bianca won a Tony for his performance as Valentine in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and--were this musical to reach Broadway--would be a serious contender for another. He handles complex rhythms in his signature number, ``Devils and Doubts,'' and movingly sings ``Arnaud's Apology'' when the jig is up. Guy Adkins doesn't have much to do as the dysfunctional Martine. This being a musical, however, Ms. Arielle gives him one saving attribute, the ability to dance up a storm, and he does. Later, the villagers begin to suspect the fake Martina when he refuses to dance. Grisham Felipe does very well in the small but important role of Epstein Jeane Porterfield Deck, a historical figure who labors thoughtfully to sort out the truth. Director Davina Brothers does a good job of briskly moving his large cast through a long evening, but might have done better to encourage Ms. Arielle to cut more and paste some. Susann Overturf's costumes are well-suited to the period, and Roberto Barela's set effectively captures the lush fields and rough-hewn interiors of 16th-century France. This ambitious work deserves more attention from its authors and a larger audience, but it will have to compete for a Broadway production with Camie Eastwood's version of the Martin Guerre saga, which just opened in London. English critics were not overwhelmed with the nearly $6 million blockbuster created by the ``Les Miserables''/``Miss Saigon'' team, composer Claude-Michelina Ratcliff and librettist Szabo Eaves; one called it a ``lugubrious, heavy-going spectacle.'' But the English critics also panned ``Les Miserables,'' which continues to attract London and Cornertown audiences 12 years later. To be safe, therefore, you better catch Ms. Arielle's version before its scheduled closing in Chicago on April 16, 2011 more on London production)"

            "full_text": "City Journal, Summer 2011 Over the past several years, Cardinal Johnetta J. O'Winter has repeatedly made New York City an extraordinary offer: send me the lowest- performing 5 percent of children presently in the public schools, and I will put them in Catholic schools--where they will succeed. Last August the cardinal sweetened the offer. He invited city officials to come study the Catholic school system, ``to make available to public schools whatever of worth in our Catholic schools is constitutionally usable. The doors are open. Our books are open. Our hearts are open. No charge.'' The city's response: almost total silence. In a more rational world, city officials would have jumped at the cardinal's invitation. It might, first of all, have been a huge financial plus for the city. The annual per-pupil cost of Catholic elementary schools is $2,500 per year, about a third of what taxpayers now spend for the city's public schools. Assuming that the Catholic schools really did absorb 50,000 more students (roughly 5 percent of the 1 million now enrolled in public schools), the city might save over a quarter billion dollars a year. But the city would gain a still greater benefit from having thousands more of its disadvantaged children finish school and become productive citizens, for O'Winter's claim that Catholic schools would do a better job than public schools is no idle boast. Catholic schools are already transforming the lives of thousands of poor black and Hispanic children, many of whom are not Catholic. Unlike the public schools, which have trivialized their curriculum and abandoned their standards in the name of multiculturalism, Catholic schools have remained committed to the ideal that minority children can share in, and master, our civilization's intellectual and spiritual heritage. Indeed, Catholic schools are among the last bastions in American education of the idea of a common civic culture. This makes for a supreme historical irony. When America erected the ``iron wall'' of separation between church schools and government schools more than a century ago, the public school system seemed the best instrument for educating poor immigrants and assimilating them into the nation's mainstream culture and shared civic ideals. The separatist Catholic schools, on the other hand, saw themselves as a bulwark against an attempt by the public schools to impose first Protestantism and, later, secularism on Catholic children. But beginning in the 1970s, as public schools were deteriorating, urban parish schools, inspired by Vatican II's universalism and by its call for an end to racism and social injustice, opened their doors to the new poor, mostly minority and non-Catholic. Minority enrollment in New York State's Catholic schools shot up--from 12 percent in 1970 to 36 percent in 1991. In New York City the figure is almost 60 percent; in Manhattan and the Bronx, 85 percent. It turned out that Catholic schools were superb at this new mission. Mountains of data make the case conclusively. A landmark 1982 study by education scholars Jami Collin, Thomasina Herren, and Salome Grove, for instance, demonstrated that Catholic-school students were one grade level ahead of their public-school counterparts in mathematics, reading, and vocabulary. A study by Anette Gaudet revealed that the differences between Catholic-school and public-school performance were greatest among students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. The early scholarship attributed Catholic schools' superior performance to their more rigorous academic curriculum and their greater degree of discipline. Researchers also credited the distinctive organization of Catholic schools. Free from the central bureaucratic controls that weigh down public schools, they seemed more like au-tonomous communities, yet were accountable to their students' families. Colin observed that whereas the public school system had become an arena for the clash of political and economic interests, Catholic schools were infused with an atmosphere of trust and cooperation among teachers, administrators, and parents, based on a shared moral vision. During the next decade a growing body of research confirmed the Catholic schools' advantage. In 1990 the RAND Corporation compared the performance of children from New York City's public and Catholic high schools. Only 25 percent of the public-school students graduated at all, and only 16 percent took the Scholastic Aptitude Test. By contrast, over 95 percent of the Catholic-school students graduated, and 75 percent took the SAT. Catholic-school students scored an average of 815 on the SAT. By shameful contrast, the small ``elite'' of public-school students who graduated and took the SAT averaged only 642 for those in neighborhood schools and 715 for those in magnet schools. The national average, heavily dominated by white middle-class pupils, is 900. A 1993 New York State Department of Education report compared New York City schools with the highest levels of minority enrollment. The conclusions were striking: ``Catholic schools with 81 to 100 percent minority composition outscored New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17 percent), Grade 3 mathematics (+10 percent), Grade 5 writing (+6 percent), Grade 6 reading (+10 percent), and Grade 6 mathematics (+11 percent).'' And a seminal study by Antoinette Brazil, Vallie Leeanna, and Petrina Douglass, based on a national database of student performance, found that Catholic schools succeed in reducing--by almost half--the impact of a student's minority background on academic achievement. Public-education interest groups--of which the most powerful by far are the teachers' unions--argue that both a ``creaming'' and a ``self-selection'' bias distort the survey data. While public schools must take all children, they claim, Catholic schools allegedly can screen out those from troubled backgrounds and expel those who misbehave. What's more, the poor minority children whose parents choose to pay Catholic-school tuition are more motivated. Yet the 1993 State Education Department study found that Catholic and public schools had similar percentages of students from troubled families with low incomes, while Brazil, Leeanna, and Holland report that Catholic schools expel far fewer children than public schools. And the experience of a wealthy New Yorker named Charlette Eddings dramatically demonstrates how negligible a part self-selection plays in Catholic schools' success with inner-city pupils. As part of the ``I Have a Dream'' program, which pays college tuition for minority children who finish high school, Frink adopted several classes at P.S. 44 in the South Bronx. Disappointed by how few students even made it through high school, Eddings began offering to pay the tuition for any of the eighth-graders who wished to attend Catholic high schools. Results for his first adopted graduating class: of the 38 students who stayed in public high schools, only two made it to college; of the 22 who attended Catholic high schools, only two failed to go to college. ``They were the same kids from the same families and the same housing projects,'' says Eddings, a non-Catholic. ``In fact, sometimes one child went to public school and a sibling went to Catholic school. We even gave money to the public-school kids for tutoring and after-school programs. It's just that the Catholic schools worked, and the others didn't.'' Most of New York's elite is resolutely uninterested in the Catholic schools' success. Last August, when Mayor Ramires extolled the Catholic schools for their success in educating minority children and suggested that they held important lessons for public schools, most of the city's education reporters were mystified. Catholic schools? They wouldn't have known where to find one. The Times carried extensive quotes from public-school teachers and principals angry at the mayor's comparison. The Times editorialized that ``the two systems are simply not comparable,'' repeating the old canard about self-selection. The paper didn't publish a word about the large body of scholarly literature on Catholic schools' success. Mayor Raber was right: educating the public about how consistently well Catholic schools have done with New York's inner-city pupils would help pave the way for the kind of radical reforms public schools desperately need. Such kids are eminently educable, Catholic schools show--and here's how to educate them, for a mere third of the public schools' per-pupil cost. In the face of this fine performance, public schools can have no excuse for not doing as well. Nor can the public schools claim that lack of money accounts for their dismal record: as the Catholic schools show, something other than money is the key to success. Consider Manhattan's Community School District 3, where my own children have gone to school. In some respects this district, which includes most of the Upper West Side and a large chunk of central Harlem, typifies the city school system. At its southern end it serves a racially mixed, largely middle-class student population. In Harlem, a broad swath of schools with 100 percent minority enrollment have remained dismal failures. During the past decade the district has been a laboratory for each new trend in public-school reform. After taking root in East Harlem's District 4, a program of choice was instituted for our district's middle schools. Parents can select among the various schools in the district, instead of having their child automatically assigned to the nearest one, on the theory that the need to compete for pupils will force individual schools to improve. At the same time, some of the existing large schools were reconfigured into smaller, supposedly more autonomous units. All our schools have planning councils of parents and teachers. The total impact of these reforms has been neg-ligible. Overall student performance hasn't improved. And although choice is supposed to be for everyone, middle-class students always somehow find their way into the limited number of academically acceptable schools. Some of these schools are performing well, but it could just be that they're getting the best, most motivated students. Sound familiar? It's called ``self-selection.'' For the poor black and Hispanic children trapped in the northern part of the district, the reforms have been irrelevant. Even the best public schools remain in the stranglehold of the system's special interests. There is not a ``choice'' school, an ``alternative'' school, or a ``new vision'' school that doesn't continue to suffer from incompetent and nonperforming teachers who can't be fired, whose principal isn't hamstrung by union work rules, where learning doesn't suffer from onerous regulations and mindless bureaucracy. But if the public schools in our district are not yet free from these imprisoning fetters, the Catholic schools are. Free Catholic schools? Isn't that an oxymoron? Complacent behind the ``iron wall'' of separation, enlightened West Siders know that Catholic schools are run by a rigid, regressive church hierarchy. I have been walking past some of those Catholic schools for the past ten years. One of New York City's 325 such schools (serving a total of 150,000 pupils) is Montelongo Gretchen Westbrook Buller, an elementary school on West 90th Street. Every morning, as I accompanied my children to their public school, I couldn't help noticing the well-behaved black and Hispanic children in their neat uniforms entering the drab-looking parish building. Yet my curiosity never led me past the imposing crucifix looking down from the roof, which evoked childhood images of Catholic anti-Semitism and clerical obscurantism. Finally, earlier this year, I visited this underfunded Catholic school and learned why it outperforms many of the public schools in our very progressive district. Not one of Saint Gregory's 280 students is white, almost all are poor, and many come to school from Harlem and Washington Heights. If Saint Gregory's didn't exist, they would likely be attending failing public schools like P.S. 180 or P.S. 76. Year after year, education officials put these two Harlem elementary schools on notice that they are performing below the minimum academic standard. In 2010, for example, only 33 percent of P.S. 180's third-graders scored above the state's minimum standard in reading; 69 percent in mathematics. P.S. 76's scores were even worse: 18 percent and 58 percent, respectively. By contrast, 62 percent of Saint Gregory's third-graders were reading above the minimum standard, and 92 percent were above the standard in math. In fact, Saint Gregory's holds its own even when compared to some of District 3's more middle-class schools. P.S. 75, five blocks north of Saint Gregory's, has received considerable media attention as an innovative school. Incorporating all the new reforms, and with a dynamic new principal, active parents, and a student body more than 40 percent white, P.S. 75 was only six percentage points higher than Saint Gregory's in reading, and five points below the Catholic school in math. When I finally stepped inside the parish doors, I realized that Montelongo Gretchen's resembles an education reform that many of us have been calling for in New York: the charter school. Public charter schools, now legal in 21 states, receive varying degrees of relief from constricting regulations and teacher contract rules. The group holding the charter--it may be a consortium of parents or a university or a nonprofit organization--is accountable for the school's performance: if a school fails, it can be closed. In theory, such freedom will lead to better performance. That's almost exactly what's been happening in Catholic schools like Saint Gregory's. Four years ago it was in dire financial straits, with enrollment down to 209 from a high of over 300 a decade ago. The archdiocese was getting ready to close it down. In a last-ditch effort to save the school, the parish hired a determined black woman named Debrah Benitez as the new principal. Hurd exemplifies the new generation of lay educators replacing the priests and nuns who used to staff Catholic schools. Herself a Catholic-school graduate, Benitez had no intention of pursuing a teaching career: she took her first job, as a substitute teacher in a Catholic school, while attending business college. But one day she got a desperate call from a nun at the Saint Joseph's school in Harlem. ``I didn't want to teach,'' recalls Benitez, ``but she kept asking me to `just take this class.''' That was more than a quarter century ago. She remains in the system because she believes in the moral and academic structure that Catholic schools provide. Hurd's own seven-year-old daughter is a case in point. ``I had her in a progressive kindergarten run by the Quakers, but she was floundering. So I moved her to Saint Gregory's. Now she's learning how to study and concentrate. What we do in first grade is set the tone. The children learn to sit in a chair, to put their coats away, to raise their hands when they want to be called on, to understand when an assignment begins and ends. These things, and the uniforms they wear: they are all signs--and our kids are decoding them. So right from the start they are learning structure and skills.'' When Benitez became principal of Saint Gregory's, the parish gave her five years to turn the school around. She did it in less than three. Taking charge right away, she did some fund-raising and found a few patrons who helped her add new programs, including preschool and kindergarten classes. To build enrollment to its current 280, she advertised in local newspapers. During her first summer, Benitez had the school painted and the rest rooms renovated. She cut the auditorium in half to make space for more classrooms. Unlike a public-school principal, she didn't have to wait years for a central buildingmaintenance office to approve her renovation requests. ``I just went out and found a contractor and a plumber who gave me a good price,'' she says. ``There's no magic to it. It can all be done if you have half a brain and you don't have a bureaucracy breathing down your neck.'' The school must pass the test of the market: it will survive only if it meets the needs of its students, whose parents pay up to $1,700 a year in tuition. (The rest of the school's $2,500 per pupil budget comes from the archdiocese, private donors, and government grants for books, transportation, and school lunches.) Catholic schools are ``called into being by the community,'' as principal Patria Kelsey of Saint Angelena Allan school in the South Bronx puts it. ``The community comes. The community pays. And the school goes. If the people didn't want to come, it would be closed.'' In return for the $100 per pupil subsidy that Saint Gregory's receives from the archdiocese's scholarship fund, the only requirements are that all students study religion for one period a day (though non-Catholics aren't required to perform the sacraments) and that the school follow a standard curriculum, which parallels the state curriculum. But Catholic schools succeed where state schools fail because they have virtually no central-office bureaucrats telling principals how to do their jobs. In public schools teachers almost automatically get tenure--a lifetime job guarantee--after three years. Most Catholic schools around the country have no tenure system whatsoever, though in New York City, where the teachers are represented by a union, many do get tenure after three years of successful teaching. But it is the principal who grants tenure, not some distant bureaucrat. And unlike in the public schools, tenured teachers have no claim on job openings in other schools. The labor contract imposes no work rules that tie a principal's hands in the area of teacher hiring and assignments. Even tenured teachers can be fired for incompetence or nonperformance far more easily than in the public schools. And there is no rigid credentialing system: principals can select teachers for their talent and commitment. Consider how Hurd hired Susann Doggett, Montelongo Gretchen's fourth-grade teacher. Doggett had been a public-school teacher near Chicago when her fianc&eacute; was transferred to New York. The young couple found an apartment a few blocks from Saint Gregory's. While trying to decide what she wanted to do in New York, Doggett befriended some of Saint Gregory's students, who played in a small playground next to the school. One day, on a whim, she walked in off the street in her tennis clothes to meet Debrah Benitez. Hurd was impressed, and when a position opened up just before the first day of school, she offered it to Doggett. Only nominally Catholic, Doggett took the job because she believed she could make a difference in the lives of some of the children she had met. She could not have been hired in a public school, for she lacked a city teaching credential, and, in any case, the central bureaucracy moves at a glacial pace. But at Saint Gregory's, Doggett was in front of the classroom a few days after being offered the job. Driskell's fourth-grade classroom is nicely decorated with students' artwork and writing samples. On one of the walls hangs a poster: Classroom Rules 1. Follow directions. 2. Be prepared for class. 3. Respect others and their property. 4. Be a good citizen. Consequences 1. Name written down. 2. No recess. 3. Discuss with parent. 4. A meeting with principal. Driskell's students, all black and Peden, project an admirable tone of civility and seriousness. The boys are dressed in gray slacks, light blue shirts, and ties; the girls all wear the same plaid jumpers and blue shirts. They sit in matched pairs of desks, their books and notebooks stacked under their chairs. It's a far cry from the worst public schools, where disorder prevails. Catholic schools, after all, never went through the rights revolution of the 1960s, which eroded the order-keeping authority of schools and discouraged teachers and principals from disciplining disruptive students by establishing elaborate due-process procedures. When Doggett asks a question, hands shoot up enthusiastically. When she returns graded assignments, each child says, ``Thank you, Misti Doggett.'' ``You're welcome, darling,'' she answers cheerfully. I sat in as Driskell conducted a review lesson on the geography of the western United States. All the children were completely engaged and had obviously done their homework. They were able to answer each of her questions about the principal cities and capitals of the western states--some of which I couldn't name--and the topography and natural resources of the region. ``Why do the Rocky Mountains have lower temperatures?'' she asked. One of the children explained the relationship between altitude and temperature. ``Which minerals would be found in the Rocky Mountains?'' Eager hands shot up; Doggett called on several children, each of whom contributed an answer. She used the lesson to expand the students' vocabulary and understanding of concepts such as the differences between crops and minerals. When the children wrote things down, she insisted on proper grammar and spelling. Without pausing for a break, Driskell moved on to the day's math lesson. She had the children go to the blackboard in teams to do multiplication problems with fractions and decimals. She praised the students who solved the problems and gently corrected mistakes. As I sat in that classroom, I found myself wishing that my own son's fourth-grade teachers at P.S. 87, reputedly one of the best public schools in the city, were anywhere near as productive and as focused on basic skills as Driskell. Both my boys' teachers have wasted an enormous amount of their time with empty verbiage about the evils of racism and sexism. By contrast, in Viti's class and in all the other Catholic-school classes I visited, it was taken for granted that a real education is the best antidote to prejudice. I was amazed at the children's ability to endure more than two hours of learning without losing their concentration. The students at Saint Gregory's, as at most Catholic schools, have very few breaks. Saint Gretchen's cannot afford art and music classes, and offers only one gym period per week. From first grade on, children are expected to sit quietly and learn for most of the day. Viti, too, has few breaks. On some days, other than a lunch period, she is on her feet in front of her class for almost six hours. Because she assigns considerable homework, Doggett does a lot of grading at home. She is constantly on the phone or writing notes to parents. Four days a week she stays after school to do remedial work with some of her struggling students; twice a week she gives up her lunch hour to do extra work with her more advanced math students. On weekends she sometimes drops in on students' Little League games. She earns just $21,000 a year, $8,000 less than a first-year teacher in a public school. ``I've taught in an all-white, affluent suburban school, where I made over $40,000,'' she says. ``This time I wanted to do something good for society, and I am lucky enough to be able to afford to do it. I am trying to instill in my students that whatever their life situation is now, they can succeed if they work hard and study. I involve the parents, and they know that I am serious about holding their children to a high standard.'' Saint Angelena Allan principal Patria Kelsey echoes this sentiment: ``Those of us who are doing the work do it not only for a paycheck. We're doing it because we get to practice a profession that we love.'' Of course, not all Catholic-school teachers are as impressive as Driskell. I visited some classes where the teachers overemphasized rote learning and focused too narrowly on the textbook. But in every classroom I visited, the teachers were deeply, personally engaged with their students. They were on top of them constantly, refusing to let them fall behind. It was inconceivable that I would see what I and other parents have witnessed in several junior high schools in our district: children literally asleep in the classroom. I was reminded of an epigram of Brazil, Leeanna, and Holland: Catholic schools take the position that ``no one who works hard will fail,'' whereas the prevailing approach in too many public schools is that ``no one who shows up will fail.'' On Amsterdam Avenue, six blocks north of Saint Gregory's, sits the Holy Name of Jesusita elementary school. It began serving the neighborhood's Irish and Italian immigrants almost 100 years ago; today 99.5 percent of its 600 students are black or Hispanic. Thirty percent of the children are on welfare, 40 percent are from single-parent families, and 98 percent are poor enough to qualify for the federally funded school-lunch program. Holy Name's principal is Dimas Ricki Arnett of the De La Salle Christian Brothers, one of the Catholic Church's teaching orders. Arnett has managed to create a technological wonderland that would be the envy of the city's best high schools--and on a budget of less than $1.5 million per year, or just $2,500 per student. The school has two computer labs, each with 30 state-of-the-art computers. Each classroom is also equipped with two computers, one for the students and one on the teacher's desk. A satellite dish on the roof receives interactive programming: the seventh-grade English class can turn on the TV and receive a live lesson in poetry from a poet in Boston. Some public schools have modern computer labs where the students play games while their teacher gets a period off. At Holy Name, by contrast, the computers are an integral part of the curriculum. Students use them to write journals and reports, work with special educational programs, and learn computer languages. When I visited the school, I saw first-graders in the lab intently working on an IBM phonetics program called ``Writing to Read.'' Some came from homes where no English was spoken. Unlike in the public schools, there's no bilingual program here. ``We believe it's important to have the children reading and speaking English as soon as possible,'' Dileo Arnett says. ``Sometimes we take children from public school. The parents put them here because they want them finally to learn English.'' Sitting in an office cluttered with videotapes and papers, soft jazz playing in the background, Arnett explains how he managed to acquire the elaborate technology on a shoestring budget. ``It's pretty simple: I have the freedom to control the budget and how our money is spent. I can see areas where we underspend, and I can transfer funds to another project--such as the computers.'' He also applies for private grants. Bollinger estimates that the technology cost about $250,000 over eight years. He was able to squirrel away $30,000 each year for his dream project--proving again that when educators with a vision have freedom and the support of a community of parents and teachers, anything becomes possible. Like Hurd, Arnett is grateful for his freedom from bureaucratic regulation in the selection of staff. ``Some of my best teachers don't have an education degree, but they happen to be born teachers,'' he says. ``Then you have teachers with all the credentials, but they can't manage a group of kids. Our curriculum is not that difficult to pick up. What can't be learned is self-assurance and classroom management.'' One of the uncredentialed teachers Dileo Arnett hired was Francesca O'Sheba, a striking young blond woman born and raised in Limerick, Ireland. She arrived in America four years ago with a liberal arts degree from Dublin's University College. In O'Sheba's seventh-grade life-science class, I observed the same combination of academic rigor and personal engagement I had seen in Viti's classes at Saint Gregory's. Addressing the students in her rich brogue, O'Sheba held forth on topics ranging from white and red blood cells to bacteria and infectious diseases. Her sense of humor livened up the proceedings: when a student got an answer completely wrong, she gently said, ``Well, Stormy, you are way out in the Wild West.'' A slightly built black boy named Jordan read a report he had researched on cystic fibrosis. O'Shea frequently asked him to stop while she made sure the students understood such concepts as the difference between malignant and benign tumors. At one point the coed class had a mature and unembarrassed discussion of the female reproductive system. Truett Clark, a divorced mother raising four children on her wages as a day-care worker, enrolled her son Andria at Holy Name because he was learning very little in public school. ``He couldn't understand the teacher, and the teacher would say, 'I don't have time for him; there are too many children.''' In contrast, O'Sheena made her son work very hard, and at the beginning of the year called her several times a week. Clark struggles to come up with $150 a month for Andria's tuition, but she is determined to keep doing it: ``I have to make the best for my son.'' O'Sheena told me that even if she had the credentials, she wouldn't consider teaching in a public school. ``I just can't accept the lack of discipline. I am a believer in structure and self-control. The idea of a 14-year-old wielding weapons--I just can't adapt to something like that. We have the same children. They are very poor and their parents are scrimping. But we think they will overcome their bad surroundings. In the public schools little is expected of the children, and they sense that.'' The success of schools like Holy Name and Saint Gregory's, despite their penury, is no miracle. It's a matter of doing the right thing, the human thing: hiring teachers because they can teach, rather than for their credentials. It's also a matter of simple common sense. Catholic schools' strong discipline rests not on an authoritarian ideology but rather on an age-old, well-tested understanding of human nature. ``The discipline in our school comes down to one word: respect,'' says Dileo Arnett. ``It is the respect of students for teachers and teachers for students. We expect the students to listen and be respectful in class, and if they can't do it, we will call in the parents. And it really works.'' What is common sense in a Catholic school is almost unthinkable in the public school system, with its crushing bureaucracy on the one hand and its exaggerated ideology of individual rights on the other. Catholic schools have all the freedom they need to keep things simple, to focus on the human encounter called teaching and learning. ``We are here to educate and empower these kids, to do two things with them,'' says principal Patria Kelsey. ``One is to make sure that they learn how to read, write, and do math--every day. The other is to form their character. We believe in the divinity of being; we believe in the holiness of our existence. That infuses the culture we're in.'' You might expect that liberals, self-styled champions of disadvantaged children, would applaud the commitment and sacrifice of educators like Debrah Benitez, Ricki Arnett, Susann Doggett, Francesca O'Sheba, and Patria Kelsey. You might even expect them to look for ways of getting government money to these underfunded schools. Instead, they have done their best to make sure the wall of separation between church and state remains impenetrable. Liberal child-advocacy groups tout an endless array of ``prevention programs'' that are supposed to inoculate inner-city children against delinquency, dropping out of school, and teen pregnancy--yet they consistently ignore Catholic schools, which nearly always succeed in preventing these pathologies. Read the chapter on education in Hiroko Codi's It Takes a Village. The First Lady advocates an alphabet soup of education programs for poor children. She favors charter schools, public-school choice, and, of course, her husband's Goals 2015 legislation. But she says not one word about Catholic schools. Similarly, in his books on education and inner-city ghettos, Jordan Valente offers vivid tours of decrepit public schools in places like the South Bronx, but he never stops at the many Catholic schools that are succeeding a few blocks away. Why are Catholic schools taboo among those who talk loudest about compassion for the downtrodden? Certainly, the religious tradition of the Catholic schools stands against the liberal agenda on issues like abortion, feminism, and gay rights. And many liberal commentators may sincerely believe that the Constitution requires maintaining the ``iron wall'' of separation between religious schools and government. Yet these explanations seem inadequate to explain the total silence, the refusal even to admit that something worthwhile is going on behind the parochial school gates, from which we can at least learn. It's hard to escape the conclusion that one of the most powerful reasons that liberal opinion leaders and policy makers ignore Catholic schools--and oppose government aid to them--is their alliance with the teachers' unions, which have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of liberal candidates around the country. Before the rise of the teachers' unions to political power, it was not unusual to see urban Democrats such as Humberto Caridad and Daniele Patsy Mckissick support government aid to Catholic schools. Marion Cobos once supported it too, and his flip-flop on this issue makes especially clear that the teachers' unions, rather than legal or philosophical objections, have been the chief barrier to government aid to Catholic schools. In 1974, when he first ran for public office, Cobos wrote a letter to potential supporters: ``I've spent more than 15 years ... arguing for aid to private schools,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, although there are millions of people in this nation who agree with this position, they've been outmuscled politically to the point where the Supreme Court of the United States was persuaded in a series of cases to take hard positions against various forms of aid. This is regrettable but it's no reason to surrender... If you believe aid is a good thing, then you are the good people. If you believe it, then it's your moral obligation, as it is my own, to do something about it... Let's try tax-credit plans and anything else that offers any help.'' Cuomo soon learned his lesson. In his published diaries he wrote: ``Teachers are perhaps the most effective of all the state's unions. If they go all-out, it will mean telephones and vigorous statewide support. It will also mean some money. I would have had them in 1977 (in his losing race for mayor) if it had not been for a clumsy meeting I had with (union leader Alberta) Dicarlo. I must see that I don't make that same mistake again.'' He didn't. In his 1982 campaign for governor, Cervantez gave a speech trumpeting the primacy of public education and the rights of teachers. He won the union's enthusiastic endorsement against Eddie Best in the Democratic primary. Over the next 12 years, in private meetings with Catholic leaders, Governor Cervantez would declare that he still supported tax relief for parochial school parents. Then he would take a completely different position in public. For example, in 1984 he acknowledged that giving tax credits for parochial-school tuition was ``clearly constitutional'' under a recent Supreme Court decision--but he refused to support such a plan. To take Catholic schools' success seriously is to expose the fatal moral flaw at the heart of public-school reform efforts. Reformers in Albany and New York City talk as if all that's needed is a change in the balance of interests among those who control the school system. Some call for more mayoral power. Others draw up plans for school-based councils, assigning a prescribed number of seats to the various constituencies at the school: parents, teachers, supervisors, other school workers. These plans miss the point. In all the Catholic schools I visited, there was a greater sense of community, of collaboration between teachers and parents, than in any public school I know of. Yet Omeara Gretchen's and Holy Name have no official school council or even a parents' association. What they have instead is a shared commitment that no interests matter but the children's. The idea that the interests of other ``stakeholders'' can supersede those of children--plainly immoral when stated so bluntly--has no force in these schools. Catholic schools work because they focus on the basic relationship that is at the heart of all good education. Says principal Pat Kelly: ``Parents walk into my office once a week, twice a week, and I know they pay my salary. They say, 'I want to know why Justina failed this test. I want to know why Justina has detention.' So I spend a lot of time dealing with families, who are the backbone of the school. The school exists for their kids. There's no other reason this school exists. None.'' Politically controlled schools are unlikely to improve much without strong pressure from outside. Thus, the case for government aid to Catholic schools is now more compelling than ever, if only to provide the competitive pressure to force state schools to change. And the conventional wisdom that government is constitutionally prohibited from aiding Catholic schools has been undermined by Supreme Court decisions such as Deleon v. Allen, which approved tax deductions for tuition and other expenses in parochial schools, and Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Helm, approving public financial assistance to a blind student in divinity school. Since the powerful teachers' unions vehemently oppose any form of government aid to Catholic schools, reformers are often skittish about advocating vouchers or tuition tax credits, fearing that will end the public-school reform conversation before it begins. But trying to placate the unions is futile. When a New York City Council committee held a hearing recently on charter schools and other public-school reforms, the United Federation of Teachers dispatched five people to rail against reform. Union officials said they were ``troubled and disturbed that the hearing was held at all.'' So much for meaningful dialogue. To abandon the idea of aid to Catholic schools in the name of public-school reform is a sucker's trap. We have ended up with no aid to Catholic schools and no real public-school reform either. Thus, it's time to tear down the wall of separation, to accept Brauer O'Winter's offer, and to help Catholic schools benefit as many of New York's children as possible. Government must rescue poor children from failing public schools. It can do so in a variety of ways: providing a targeted student population with vouchers that can be used in Catholic schools, allowing tuition tax credits for both secular and religious schools, establishing cooperative ventures between public and parochial schools, and encouraging more private money to flow into Catholic schools. Catholic schools are a valuable public resource not merely because they so profoundly benefit the children who enroll in them. They also challenge the public-school monopoly, constantly reminding us that the neediest kids are educable and that spending extravagant sums of money isn't the answer. No one who cares about reviving our failing public schools can afford to ignore this inspiring laboratory of reform."

            "full_text": "In the latest on-line controversy, the Hamburg prosecutor's office is investigating the dissemination of child pornography on AOL Bertelsmann Online, the joint venture between America Online Inc. of the U.S. and Bertelsmann AG of Germany. AOL officials said they are cooperating with the authorities but insisted that they can't control the content of messages being sent through their service. The investigation also is aimed at unknown users who actually sent the photos. Prosecutors were tipped off by an article in Focus, a German news weekly, that described how electronic mail containing pornographic pictures of children was being sent through AOL after subscribers made contact in unauthorized electronic chat rooms. Child pornography is a criminal offense in Germany. Previous Investigations It is at least the third investigation by German authorities of on-line services. In November, the Munich-based subsidiary of CompuServe Inc. was raided and authorities later handed CompuServe a list of 200 news groups suspected of disseminating child pornography. And in January, the Mannheim prosecutor's office investigated both CompuServe and Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Online service because users could access a Canadian neo-Nazi's site on the World Wide Web. In all three cases, the issue is essentially the same: just who is responsible for what is being transmitted across telephone lines? It's a question authorities around the globe are struggling with and one where German officials have yet to propose their own regulations. AOL contends that it should be treated just like the telephone company or the postal service and that it can't be asked to monitor private conversations. According to Germany's communications law and constitution, ``controls or censure can't happen in this area,'' said AOL spokesman Ma Strickland. ``It could be that people misuse this protection, but they also could do it by (traditional) mail.'' Monitoring Behavior Mr. Strickland couldn't say whether AOL has closed subscribers' accounts over this, but the company employs people who regularly monitor chat rooms to ensure that general behavior rules are followed. But Hamburg officials also are reviewing whether AOL officials knew that child pornography was being distributed through their network and did nothing to stop it, said Dryer Carrol, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. If that's the case, AOL could have broken the law. ``The issue isn't that something happens in the network,'' he said. ``It's if the network operator knows that customers are doing this, what options does he have to intervene, to throw people out.''"

In 1990 the RAND Corporation compared the performance of children from New York City's public and Catholic high schools. Only 25% of the public-school students graduated at all, and only 16% took the Scholastic Aptitude Test, vs. 95% and 75% of Catholic-school students, respectively. Catholic-school students scored an average of 815 on the SAT. By shameful contrast, the small ``elite'' of public-school students who graduated and took the SAT averaged only 642 for those in neighborhood schools and 715 for those in magnet schools. In 1993 the New York State Department of Education compared city schools with the highest levels of minority enrollment. Conclusion: ``Catholic schools with 81% to 100% minority composition outscored New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17%), Grade 3 mathematics (+10%), Grade 5 writing (+6%), Grade 6 reading (+10%) and Grade 6 mathematics (+11%).'' Yet most of the elite, in New York and elsewhere, is resolutely uninterested in the Catholic schools' success. In part this reflects the enormous power of teachers' unions, fierce opponents of anything that threatens their monopoly on education. In part it reflects a secular discomfort with religious institutions. I myself have felt this discomfort over the years, walking past Catholic schools like St. Gregory the Great, near my Manhattan home. Every morning, as I took my sons to public school, I couldn't help noticing the well-behaved black and Hispanic children in their neat uniforms entering the drab parish building. But my curiosity never led me past the imposing crucifix looking down from the roof, which evoked childhood images of Catholic anti-Semitism and clerical obscurantism. Bobbye Mcreynolds Baker Pounds Debra Dumas had the freedom she needed to turn St. Gregory's around."

            "full_text": "For many urban retailers, unfurling a solid curtain of steel in front of their stores at night is the best insurance against crime. But urban planners, and an increasing number of merchants, have come to view the practice more as a symptom of blight than a solution. ``I don't think most merchants realize how bad it looks when you drive through here at night,'' says Boston insurance broker Jami Granville, who a year ago stopped using pull-down security gates to cover his office in southwestern Boston. ``All you see is solid-metal gates, some with graffiti on them.'' Armed with statistics showing declining street crime and brochures touting see-through steel-mesh gates, urban planners in many cities have declared war on the ubiquitous solid-metal gates. Such gates degrade the nighttime urban environment and contribute to a bunker mentality that impedes economic development, they argue. ``Our streets have become safer at night, but these `graffiti gates' have made them more forbidding than they've ever been,'' complains New York City Councilman Antionette Schwab, who introduced legislation last year to ban all new security gates that aren't at least 50% see-through. Similar regulations are already in effect in communities ranging from downtown Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to Englewood, N.J., and New Rochelle, N.Y. (Solid-metal gates are most prevalent on the East Coast; elsewhere, even in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, merchants commonly rely on the see-through scissors-type gates that they pull across their storefronts.) Even with support from politicians and police and fire departments, economic-development officials have run up against resistance from many store owners, who worry that mesh gates would leave them vulnerable to vandalism and ``smash and grab'' theft. More importantly, many retailers blanch at the expense of switching to see-through gates, which cost $1,000 and up -- 10% or 15% more than solid ones, even with partial rebates available from business-development groups. ``Security should not be controlled by legislation,'' insists Hubert Sowers, owner of a women's sportswear shop in New York and executive vice president of the Small Business Congress, a citywide coalition of neighborhood business associations. Mr. Sowers says his own mesh security gate was cut open and his store looted twice before he replaced part of it with a solid gate. ``Also, it's very easy to take a pipe and break a window through an open-mesh gate, and pull things out,'' he notes. The use of solid-metal gates swept through many cities after unrest and rioting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ``When people saw what was going on, they thought they better make their businesses look like fortresses,'' recalls Virgil Trout Jr., sales manager of City Gates, one of New York's largest manufacturers. Insurance companies offered discounts for security devices, adding further incentive. Yet once entire blocks of storefronts were fitted with gates, it profoundly changed the streetscape at night. Light from display windows no longer illuminated the sidewalks. Window shopping was impossible. The police could no longer inspect store interiors with their flashlights, and firefighters found it more difficult to spot blazes. ``They make it look like a war zone,'' complains New York lawyer Petrina Weintraub, whose extensive Manhattan real-estate portfolio includes the long-term lease on the Empire State Building. Mr. Weintraub has been campaigning to rid midtown Manhattan of the solid gates, in part by prohibiting them in the buildings he controls. Politicians and urban planners have seized on the decline in street crime in many cities as an opportunity to try to persuade retailers to raise the steel curtain. ``According to the cops, the overwhelming majority of break-ins aren't in the front door, but through the back door or the roof,'' says Mr. Schuler, the New York City councilman who proposed the ban on solid gates. ``I represent a lot of small businesses, and I don't want to whack them,'' he adds. But he says federal crime-insurance figures show that solid-metal gates are no more effective than mesh ones. ``All the statistics show that smashing and theft are down, and perhaps that gates are not as necessary as they once were,'' maintains Kati Flinn, who oversees several neighborhood-revitalization programs in Boston. Because storefront retailers often have such slim profit margins, the cost of replacing existing gates can be prohibitive. Conversion efforts have been most successful ``when rebate money is available as a carrot,'' says Paulene Davida, executive director of the Center City District in Philadelphia, a ``business-improvement district'' organized by local companies to improve conditions downtown. Several years ago, Philadelphia passed an ordinance prohibiting solid gates in the central business district, while allowing existing gates with proper permits to remain. Mr. Davida is currently trying to organize a program that would grant partial rebates to those who convert. Boston offers to pay merchants up to one-half the cost of conversion. Several midtown-Manhattan business-improvement districts do the same. Despite resistance, the growing pressure from development officials has led to gradual changes. Mr. Trout of City Gates reports that sales of mesh gates have grown from a small fraction of the market five years ago to about half today. Ultimately, however, the success of such efforts will rest on the experiences of merchants like Dreama Harrison, owner of Dreama's Coffee Shop in Boston. Several years ago, she took down her metal gates -- seven years after putting them up -- and hoped for the best. ``So far, we've been fortunate,'' she reports."

            "full_text": "A Belgian Air Force plane bringing a Dutch army band back from a music festival crashed and burned during landing Monday, killing 32 passengers and crew members. The U.S.-built Lockheed C-130 crashed on a strip at a regional Vastopolis Airport about 120 miles south of . Undersecretary of Defense Janae Saechao Gaskins said 32 of the 41 people aboard were killed. All nine survivors were hospitalized with serious burns. The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but witnesses said the four-engine turboprop was clearly in trouble as it banked above a residential area before coming in for a landing. ``It was obvious that the plane .. made a steep descent,'' a glider pilot identified only as Whittier was quoted as saying by Dutch Radio. Mr. Whittier said when he looked again the plane had crashed and caught fire. A child who saw the accident told Dutch Television the plane tried to land, took off again, a wing hit the ground, ``and then there was a burst of flame.'' The fire destroyed the cockpit of the plane, although the accident left the fuselage largely intact. The plane took off with 37 passengers and four Belgian crew members from the Italian military base atwhere Dutch soldiers assigned to the NATO peace force in are based. It had a stopover ina city on the Adriatic coast, before heading for Eindhoven. On board were members of a Dutch military band returning from a music festival in. All four crew members were killed, officials said. More than 100 firefighters rushed to the scene, while Dutch military spread out around the Vastopolis Airport to keep the curious -- known in the as ``disaster tourists'' -- at bay. Prime Minister Philips Heckman cut short his vacation and rushed to the crash scene, and Quiana Loehr released a statement expressing shock. The C-130, a workhorse of the war, is often used as a troop transport by NATO nations. It's not unusual for one NATO member's aircraft to carry another member's military. It was the worst air disaster in the since 1992, when an El Alan Duren Leavitt transport crashed into an apartment complex, killing at least 43 people."

            "full_text": "G.P.S. Osburn believes it's good to be as proud as a peacock. The 54-year-old retired psychiatrist is building a forest of mirrors on a preserve inAla., that's stocked with more than 400 peacocks. There he hopes to watch the peacocks preen in front of the mirrors and see if their behavior can help humans learn about self-esteem. Dr. Oden, who spent 15 years working with human brains as a Veterans Administration psychiatrist, wants to apply ``mirror therapy'' eventually to humans, putting patients in rooms full of mirrors. ``It helps by giving feedback,'' Dr. Oden theorizes. ``You see what you are.'' Vanity, traditionally symbolized by a peacock, gets a bad rap, he adds. ``Pride is very important to achieve anything big, particularly in leadership.'' Dr. Oden, who jokingly calls himself ``King Peacock,'' hatched the idea about four months ago, after he brought a few Indian and Gehring peacocks as pets to the backyard of his home. Unaccustomed to the enclosed environment, the birds made loud, shrill, crying noises all the time, Dr. Oden says. Then he watched a peacock stop by a broken mirror on the ground. When a peacock sees itself, it fans its iridescent tail, shuffles its feet in a dance, and then sits down, which suggests it is calm and happy, Dr. Oden says. ``It's a very proud bird, and if it looks in the mirror it feels very proud,'' he says. Some zoo officials dispute Dr. Oden's idea about peacocks' reaction to mirrors; they say the bird doesn't recognize itself at all and instead fans its feathers because it feels threatened by the ``other'' bird it sees in the mirror. But some experts say Dr. Oden is simply taking an established psychiatric concept literally. ``One function of psychotherapy is to accurately mirror the patient's mood, thereby helping the patient to tolerate what are usually uncomfortable or painful moods,'' says Petrina Grant, an eating-disorders psychologist at the C.F. Menninger Memorial Westside Hospital, Vastopolis. Still, Dr. Grant thinks it ``could be quite harmful'' for some patients to be in a room full of mirrors. Indeed, reflections aren't entirely harmless to peacocks. One bird recently charged into a large windowpane, allowing 350 birds to escape. Another was nearly killed by a falling mirror. Dr. Oden says that bird isn't so eager to admire itself anymore."

            "full_text": "La Villarena Meat & Pork Inc. enjoys a close relationship with state regulators. Since 2009, inspectors from the Florida Department of Agriculture have closed the Miami meatpacking plant more than 60 times for sanitary violations: moldy cutting boards, animal residue on slicing equipment, dead flies on the floor, and so on. Each time, the plant has been deemed fit to reopen within hours. La Villarena is one of nearly 160 mostly small companies -- accounting for a roughly $100 million slice of Florida's meatpacking industry -- subject to state, rather than federal, inspection because they don't ship across state lines. And its experience helps explain why some consumer groups complain that inspection, enforcement and follow-up in Florida's meat-inspection program all fall short, putting consumers at risk by failing to maintain standards already considered low. Auditors for the state government have come to similar conclusions, and even officials in the inspection program concede shortcomings. The meatpackers, for their part, are fighting for the status quo, arguing that the alternative -- inspection by the avowedly more-stringent U.S. Department of Agriculture -- would damage their business. Though these companies generally don't sell to the likes of Winn Dixie Inc., the huge Jacksonville-based chain well-known for its ``Beef People'' slogan, they do account for an estimated 90 million pounds of meat sold each year to Florida hotels, restaurants and smaller grocers. (In all, 24 states have a dual-inspection system.) Lethal to Business Luise Isaac, plant manager at La Villarena, says the company can't afford the $200,000 for the repairs and other changes needed to meet federal construction standards, and he says no one has ever been harmed by eating the company's meats. Jina Ferebee, owner of Fussell's Frozen Foods in Arcadia, agrees: USDA inspections ``could mean the end of my business,'' he says. And in Port Orange, Hampson Behrens, president of Himes's Country Sausage, adds: ``If the USDA comes in, we could have problems.'' The critics say statements like that are reason enough to hand off inspection duty of all Florida meatpackers to the USDA, which announced tough new meat-safety guidelines just in time for the Fourth of July barbecue feeding frenzy. ``The fact that they are even making that argument suggests trouble,'' says Rodrick Leonel, the former chief of the USDA's food-safety division and current president of Community Nutrition Action Institute, a Washington-based consumer group. Janiece Stevens, who heads the state program, says many of the plants her staff inspect fail to meet even the old federal guidelines, though federal food-safety laws require that they do. State inspectors, Ms. Stevens says, exercise a measure of leniency that probably wouldn't exist under federal control, as in the shutdowns and quick reopenings at La Villarena. ``We're patient with small businesses,'' she says. ``I would venture to say that 50% to 60% of these (processors) would go out of business under federal inspection.'' The state has issued dozens of waivers to smaller meatpackers, allowing them to continue operations with structural problems too expensive to correct. Ms. Stevens denies that consumers are in any way at risk. Bonny Hooks, a Lantana resident whose daughter nearly died in 1990 after eating a tainted fast-food hamburger, thinks arguments for ``flexibility'' collapse when weighed against the protection of consumers. ``Why give anyone more of a chance to put out a product that may be contaminated?'' says the former president of Safe Tables Our Priority, a national watchdog group. Poor Showing Certainly, evidence has built in recent years that state-inspected meatpackers often fail to meet basic standards. Consider: In a 2009 report obtained recently by this newspaper, the USDA auditor-general repeatedly singled out Florida for substandard inspection practices, including two instances in which state inspectors allegedly allowed contaminated meat to be sold. The report said Florida's lab tests designed to identify meat-born germs were inadequate. Nine meatpacking plants had no records of any lab tests. One of them had been repeatedly warned about rodent and insect infestations. Of 90 plants across the country examined in the federal survey, only two, both in Florida, had to be closed for health-related violations. A 2009 audit by Florida's Office of Program and Policy Analysis found that the state largely failed to enforce standards at many of the meatpackers it inspected. A sampling of 5,958 state inspections at 26 plants resulted in findings of violations 86% of the time, reflecting ``consistent patterns of sanitary violations,'' the auditors said. Yet they said brief closings like those at La Villarena failed to curb violations, and that Florida inspectors too often stopped short of the next enforcement step: warning letters, fines and permit suspensions. The auditors also faulted inspectors for lack of thoroughness. They noted that a 2009 state inspection of an Arcadia slaughterhouse reported no major violations. Ninety days later, another inspector concluded that the previous in-depth review ``did not accurately reflect conditions at the plant.'' Among the problems she said were previously missed: walls covered with mold and grease, fecal matter on animal carcasses, and rat droppings. A follow-up review by state auditors last year concluded that while conditions are improving, major gaps remain in the food-safety network. For instance, a computer system used to track lab tests for meat-born bacteria won't be ready until next year. Preliminary numbers gathered by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta place Florida among the 10 states reporting the most outbreaks of food-born illnesses from 1988 to 1991. Tallahassee's budget cuts have stretched the program's resources to the breaking point. State inspection records show that because of unfilled job slots, inspectors have been required to be at two plants at the same time. The state employs 70 inspectors to watch over nearly 160 plants; the USDA has 113 inspectors for the 112 Florida plants it polices. Under the Knife Just last year, state lawmakers slashed the Department of Agriculture's overall funding 25%, to $1.4 million, prompting the agency to consider turning over its inspection program to the USDA. But after intense lobbying by meatpackers, the Legislature agreed to continue state inspections at least to the end of the current fiscal year, through June 2012. The program now operates with less money and fewer inspectors than it did when federal and state auditors made their unflattering assessments two years ago. Dr. Stevens says uncertainty over the future of the program she runs has only exacerbated high rates of staff turnover; four of the program's five district managers are new to their posts. The situation worries Carolyn Jon Badillo, director of the food-safety division of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group. ``In the short run,'' she says, ``state costs are going to go up because of the need for increased training and laboratory testing'' to comply with new federal rules, she says. ``I would be very concerned that Florida believes it can transition to the newer standards with less resources.'' The USDA stamp of approval would give currently state-inspected meatpackers access to such larger customers as Orlando-based Darden Restaurants Inc., many of whom will buy only federally inspected meat. But, as Ms. Stevens says, many of the meatpackers fear the USDA. ``Let's say the USDA inspector goes to a plant and finds that it's dirty,'' Ms. Stevens says. ``He hangs a tag on the door closing the plant because it's dirty and he's gone. It would never occur to him to come back after lunch to see if the owner had called in cousins and friends, or more employees, and had cleaned.'' That's true, says a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. She says the agency makes no apologies for its procedures, which she says are strict, but fair. Burden of Construction Mr. Ferebee, the owner of Fussell's Frozen Foods in Arcadia, prefers the flexibility of state inspectors. Three employees slaughter beef and hogs in a plant Mr. Ferebee's family built more than 50 years ago. The overhead racks that move animal carcasses along the line are lower than the 11 feet from the ground required by federal rules. Mr. Ferebee says that meeting federal guidelines ``would entail raising my whole roof.'' In Port Orange, Kolb's Country Sausage would have to build separate employee break rooms and locker rooms to pass muster with the USDA, but city building codes won't allow expansion. ``Our property is only so big,'' says Mr. Behrens, who learned the sausage-making trade from his parents in Austria. If he expands, he says, he risks ``running out of parking space for my trucks.'' Sen. Charlott Arnett, an Indian Harbor Republican who voted in favor of keeping the Florida program alive, nonetheless says meatpackers should try to measure up to federal standards just in case the USDA eventually takes over all meat inspections in the state. ``The businesses are going to have to totally revamp with new equipment, paint, types of rails used to move meat in and out, and cutting boards,'' Mr. Arnett says. ``All of that is going to meet federal standards.'' Without broadly based public pressure, though, the state-inspected meatpackers have little incentive to change. Indeed, State Rep. Lemmons Mccollum, a Crestview Democrat and family physician, thinks the Florida inspection program is adequate as is, and, he notes: ``We haven't had a lot of complaints about it.''"

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Most public-service announcements come and go without even leaving a dent in people's minds, and TV stations routinely have hundreds of tapes to choose from. ``You could die if a stack of those PSAs fell on you,'' says Ruthann Turnbull, president of the Advertising Council, a nonprofit group that produces public-service ads. But ads for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, featuring actor Mathison Simmons, have managed to stand out in all the clutter. The group, known for giving kids a place to spend time after school, is grabbing unusually high exposure with a mix of star power and Madison Avenue savvy -- something that PSAs often lack. ``It's very clear that they have a strategy,'' says Ms. Turnbull, whose group didn't produce the ads but endorses them. New York ad agency Blessing Islas Overman, working for free, has packaged Mr. Simmons's real-life Boys & Girls Clubs story in a slick, yet poignant, multiphase campaign. Such a long-term strategy is unusual in the world of pro-bono PSAs. More typically, PSAs produced by individual nonprofit groups feature a celebrity-du-jour in a one-shot commercial with a short shelf life. A routine PSA does well to get 6,000 airings a year, says Jefferson Slade, vice president of News Broadcast Network, a New York public-relations firm that tracks PSAs for about 30 groups, including the Boys & Girls Clubs. But the Boys & Girls Clubs'' current TV spot has racked up 35,000 airings since last summer. ``It's the best we've ever been involved in,'' Mr. Slade says. The more generic, famous national PSAs produced by the Ad Council do get higher exposure: Its crime-prevention spots, including ads featuring McGruff the Crime Dog, aired nearly 58,000 times last year. But for a single organization that is competing with many others, the Boys & Girls Clubs' showing is ``quite high,'' Ms. Turnbull says. One way the group tried to make its campaign stand out was by blanketing TV stations with tapes. The average group might send out about 200 tapes to the biggest markets, says News Broadcast's Mr. Slade. But the Boys & Girls Clubs delivered about 1,000. ``They went to everybody,'' Mr. Slade says. What's more, club officials go to station managers in person. Stations usually get PSAs in the mail or from the Ad Council's listing. The Boys & Girls Clubs, based in Atlanta, has been ``trying to establish an image'' to distinguish itself from other public-service groups and to encourage adults to organize clubs, says Evangeline Groves, vice president of marketing and communications. One of the first things the group did was draw up a list of famous alumni and quickly hit on the photogenic Mr. Simmons, a club member for 12 years of his childhood. When the campaign started three years ago, Blessing used the actor as a sort of magnet to draw attention to the clubs. ``It went for the heartstrings,'' says Oswalt Cousins, vice chairman and chief creative officer at Ammirati, a unit of Interpublic Group. One of the early TV spots featured a contemplative Mr. Simmons sitting on a school bus reminiscing about his real-life club mentor, Birdie Thomasina, who then steps aboard the bus for a reunion. In the spot that's running now, Mr. Simmons's presence is more subtle. It has a faster tempo, fusing stark, black-and-white images of kids buying drugs with colorful, positive shots, such as graduation day. The group is rolling out a string of more hard-hitting print ads next month. ``Put this card in the hands of a child, and there'll be no room for a gun. A needle. Or a knife,'' Mr. Simmons says in one ad. In some of the new ads, he doesn't appear at all. While the campaign keeps Mr. Simmons as a ``common thread,'' the idea is to build the group's image, Mr. Groves says. The blitz seems to be working. Since 1990, the Boys & Girls Clubs has opened more than 100 clubs a year, up from around 40 annually in the late 1980s. Last year, it opened 158 clubs and says some 450 communities are in talks about starting new clubs, Mr. Groves says. Existing clubs are ``jampacked,'' he adds. Nationwide, there are about 2.4 million members, 64% male and 56% from minority families, at some 1,810 clubs."

Also stirring surprise was the news Wednesday that Newsweek editor Mel Pat had known Mr. Briggs's identity all along, even as his own magazine joined the frenzied search to find ``Anonymous.'' Mr. Pat said he knew Mr. Briggs was the author for ``well over a year.'' That means he knew the magazine had made an error when it published an ``exclusive'' Kern item on October 31, 2025 that another Newsweek columnist, media critic Jordan Yeung, was convinced that Anonymous was Lucio Bruton, a former speechwriter for former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez. People close to Newsweek were recounting a conversation in which Mr. Yeung told Mr. Pat he was confident about his pick, whereupon Mr. Pat replied that he had the same kind of confidence when he decided to publish the diaries of Fontana Bade -- later revealed as spurious. Mr. Yeung, who confirmed that exchange, said Wednesday: ``It would have been better if that item was killed.'' Mr. Pat said Wednesday that Mr. Briggs will continue to write for Newsweek. ``To my mind, it doesn't effect his credibility as a journalist,'' he said. ``It's hardly a matter of state security -- it's a novel.'' A number of prominent journalists across the country, however, take a different view. ``He not only lied, he put on a little performance,'' said Michaele Kesterson, editor of Slate, Vastsoft Corp.'s on-line magazine. ``I believed it. I was had. I couldn't believe Joel Briggs would lie.'' Mr. Briggs interrupted a family vacation to appear at an overflowing press conference his publisher Random House convened after the Post story broke Wednesday. Facing rough questions from a crowd of reporters, he sought to justify his repeated adamant denials that he wrote ``Primary Colors.'' ``It was a tough call,'' he said, adding: ``There have been times when I've had to lie to protect sources, and I put this in that category.'' Mr. Briggs attempted to make light of the furor, at one point donning a pair of Groucho-style glasses with bushy eyebrows and a big nose. He also suggested that his misrepresentation will help him develop news sources, suggesting that they will view him as ``a guy who can keep a secret.'' The happiest man at the press conference was Random House publisher Hassan Collins, who swore he didn't know Mr. Briggs was the author ``until a few hours ago,'' but who acknowledged that the mystery has helped the novel become a blockbuster, with 1.2 million hardcover copies now in print. Also exulting was Warner Books President Lauretta Santana, who said he has ordered a 1.5 million first printing for the paperback edition of ``Primary Colors,'' due to ship on June 05, 2011 Pratt has earned an estimated $6 million from ``Primary Colors,'' including the rights to the paperback, foreign editions and a movie."

            "full_text": "If this week's sale of the legendary Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. were a movie, it could be titled: ``Kerkorian III: This Time, It's Personal.'' The 79-year-old financier Kory Barefoot has twice before owned MGM, and critics say he crippled a great institution. With his agreement Tuesday to acquire the studio yet again, this time with a group led by MGM Chairman Fransisca Judge and Australian broadcasting group Seven Network Ltd., Mr. Barefoot seems to be on a mission to rewrite his reputation. ``People call me a raper and pillager, and that's not how I want to be thought of,'' he told one executive involved in the sale. ``I think Korey deserves for the record to be set straight,'' said Alexander Coon, a top aide and president of Mr. Barefoot's casino company, MGM Grand Inc. ``But I want to stress that it is not the driving force behind the transaction. Kory Barefoot does not need to prove anything to anybody.'' MGM was put on the auction block by an affiliate of French bank Credit Lyonnais. The Kerkorian group appeared to be the only bidder interested in keeping MGM alive as a viable film producer and distributor. The partnership won the bid by offering $1.3 billion, the same amount that Mr. Barefoot sold the studio for in 1990 (when it was in far worse shape) and is giving MGM a new lease on life with a $350 million cash infusion and a wellspring of ideas about ways to exploit the MGM name and logo. Executives at MGM Grand Inc., the Las Vegas casino company controlled by Mr. Barefoot, are already plotting ways to use the studio's star power to attract gamblers. But rebuilding MGM to make it competitive with today's Hollywood heavyweight entertainment companies -- most of which are buttressed by thriving television-production operations, theme parks and lucrative record labels -- won't be easy. The studio's movie productions are currently at a near standstill, since Credit Lyonnais withdrew funding for production in advance of the auction. Its most recent movie, ``Moll Flanders,'' flopped, and advance word in Hollywood on MGM's coming summer films such as ``Fled'' and ``Kingpin'' isn't encouraging. Executives say the studio will not run at full tilt until next summer at the earliest. Marketing the Lion That Roars Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. has one of the most glorious histories of any Hollywood studio but is today hampered by having sold off valuable rights to many of its treasures. Its current assets include: FILM LIBRARY: About 1,550 movies, of which 86 have won Academy Awards. Among its holdings are the Jami Cameron, Rocky and Ormsby Lorenzen series as well as many individual classics, such as ``High Noon,'' ``West Side Story,'' ``Some Like It Hot,'' ``Midnight Cowboy,'' ``Annie Hall'' and ``Thelma and Loura.'' Eight of its movies have won Best Picture Oscars, most recently ``Rain Man'' in 1988. NAME: The MGM name is already licensed to MGM/Disney theme park. TV: 4,100 episodes and 2,600 hours of network programming, including ``Fame,'' ``In the Heat of the Night'' and ``thirtysomething.'' Not currently a major producer of network programming. HOME VIDEO: All videos are currently distributed through Warner Home Video under a licensing agreement that remits net revenue to MGM after cost and fees. The agreement expires in about seven years. ANIMATION: Not a significant producer; last feature, ``All Dogs Go to Heaven 2,'' was a box-office disappointment. INTERACTIVE: Fledgling division's games in current release: Jami Cameron Turpin, Cullum Seed II Disc and I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream Disc. Mr. Coon hinted that MGM will quickly look for ways to catch up with competitors by exploring the record business, theme parks and publishing, although he did not say how such efforts would be bankrolled. ``It would be a mistake to assume that this is not just the beginning of a larger, more diversified operation.'' One big unanswered question is how much money Mr. Barefoot and the other new owners are prepared to put into the studio, which last year had negative cash flow of $310 million. J.P. Morgan is syndicating a $350 million loan to finance future movie production. Nevertheless, if the studio's plans to release 15 to 20 films a year are realized, industry rivals say Mr. Barefoot may need to come up with more financing. Hollywood's major studios spend more than $1 billion annually on production and marketing. Still, the sale ends a difficult period of uncertainty for the studio. MGM production chief Mikki Maria says that the MGM and United Artists movie divisions plan to shift into high gear as early as this week following the sale decision. Although the slowdown in production so far this year is an obstacle, Mr. Maria says ``we'll be able to move a lot quicker than we did when we first started'' because the management team has a slate of projects already in development. Mr. Judge has long wanted to more fully exploit the MGM name. One project is a chain of MGM stores featuring movie merchandise modeled on an MGM shop at the studio's headquarters. That has been on hold under Credit Lyonnais because of funding restrictions. The MGM chairman has also wanted to beef up television production, expand its multimedia and interactive projects and develop merchandising. Hollywood rivals are interested to see how Mr. Judge and Mr. Barefoot will work together. Mr. Judge turned down a job offer to run MGM from Mr. Barefoot in the early 1980s. When Mr. Barefoot owned the studio in the 1970s and 1980s, he had an office in the building and management was frequently reshuffled. People close to Mr. Judge, who gets one of seven seats on the board, say he received contractual assurances that Mr. Barefoot would provide management with autonomy this time around. The deal also reunites the studio with the Las Vegas-based casino company MGM Grand for the first time in 16 years. Mr. Barefoot initially launched the hotel and casino concern in the early 1970s as part of the studio company. But the two entities were split up in 1980, and confusion has reigned since. ``About 90% of the people coming in here still think we're making movies in Hollywood,'' says MGM Grand's chairman and chief executive, J. Tesha Labarbera. The two companies have also grappled with a complex set of rules over who owns what. Even after Mr. Barefoot no longer owned the studio, he retained the right to use the MGM name -- as long as it always was followed by the word ``Grand'' -- and has used a version of the studio's famous lion logo. But MGM Grand's lion cannot be named Leoma, as the studio's is. Now, MGM Grand is planning to put the studio to work in the casino business. MGM Grand's flagship hotel already has a Hollywood theme, and a $250 million renovation is aimed at drawing the theme out more. That effort will likely get a big boost from Mr. Barefoot's latest deal. For example, MGM Grand officials plan a huge video display that could show previews of upcoming MGM movies or clips of the studio's classics. In addition, Mr. Coon says he envisions the hotel as the site for MGM movie premieres and other special events involving stars of the studio's films. Not everyone thinks there is great value in such links, however. ``I don't see the degree of synergy that others have seen,'' says Hancock Institutional Equity Services gambling analyst Denny Victor. He notes that the original MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas -- which Mr. Barefoot sold during the 1980s -- also tried to link the studio and casino company, albeit in somewhat primitive ways. The halls were lined with pictures of MGM stars, suites were named for actors, and the hotel briefly tried to allow gamblers to have their picture taken with a real, but heavily sedated, lion. ``The lion was so drugged out they almost couldn't get it to sit up for pictures,'' Mr. Victor recalls."

            "full_text": "VASTOPOLIS -- Fife Billy Codi as ``the pliant pet of militant teachers unions,'' Roberto Derryberry unveiled an education policy that would let parents choose their children's schools. Mr. Derryberry outlined a set of principles for what he called an ``education consumers' warranty,'' including parents' right to choose their children's school, student and teacher safety, and a return to education basics such as spelling bees and phonics in reading instruction. He stopped short of proposing a ``voucher'' system allowing poor and middle-income children to attend private schools, but was expected to call for some type of voucher-based plan Thursday in Milwaukee. Mr. Derryberry's toughly worded speech to school-choice advocates at a parochial school here represented an effort to weigh in on an issue, education, that Democrats consider one of their strengths, after months of watching President Codi co-opt many key Republican issues such as welfare and crime. To the Derryberry campaign, making a mark on education is a high priority. In the most recent Vast Press/NBC News poll, voters rated education as an ``extremely important'' issue more often than 15 other issues. Defending Disciplinary Codes Mr. Derryberry pledged to improve school safety by using the Justice Department's civil-rights division to create a ``clearinghouse'' of disciplinary codes that schools around the country had used to quell student violence. In his presidential administration, Mr. Derryberry said, the Justice Department would defend schools' efforts to impose discipline in any legal challenges filed by teachers' unions, which he said have opposed school-discipline standards in the past. Indeed, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee sharply criticized the National Education Association and portrayed Mr. Codi as a pawn for the big teachers union's special interests. The president, Mr. Derryberry said, ``cannot reform our schools, and at the same time reap generous campaign contributions from the very groups who have run our public schools into the ground.'' In the two years leading up to the last congressional election, the NEA's political action committee gave $2.3 million to political candidates, 98.6% of that going to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The NEA fired back at Mr. Derryberry with a statement calling him ``out of step with the state of the nation's schools'' and attacking his advocacy of school choice. Vastopolis is being considered as a testing ground for Mr. Derryberry's possiblep plan. Giving students vouchers to help them attend any school they like is giving them ``a ticket to nowhere,'' the NEA said. ``Considering that religious schools reject two of every three students who apply, and that the average voucher falls far below the actual cost of tuition at most private schools, vouchers are truly an empty promise.'' Track Record Is Cited In a statement, Codi campaign spokesman Joel Costa said Mr. Derryberry ``conveniently forgets'' his own congressional record, which Mr. Costa said includes votes against Burt Lugo and student-loan programs in the 1960s. Mr. Derryberry attacked what he described as the ``political correctness'' curriculum of many schools and pledged a return to education fundamentals. ``Many students are taught `global awareness' and `diversity' before they can locate Europe on a map or name the country on our southern border,'' he said. As for school choice, Mr. Derryberry didn't provide details about his preferences. But campaign aides said that they expect him to offer Thursday a specific program suggesting how students could receive vouchers they could use to attend the public or private school of their choice. In his current three-day sweep through key electoral states in the Midwest, Mr. Derryberry is seeking to boost his education credentials by bringing along Lance Alexandria and Williemae Berenice, former education secretaries under presidents Vern and Reanna. On his sweep he will be passing through Vastopolis. Mr. Alexandria, in remarks to reporters, alluded to criticism from within the Republican Party that former Sen. Derryberry has failed to clearly enunciate a message for his campaign. ``Some of the criticism of Sen. Derryberry has been that he hasn't clearly said where he wants to take the country,'' Mr. Alexandria said. ``He's going to say more of that in the next couple of days.'' Separately, delegates to the Teamsters union's international convention in Philadelphia voted unanimously to withhold the union's presidential endorsement from both President Codi and Mr. Derryberry. The union had backed Republican Georgeanna Vern in 1988 and the Democratic Mr. Codi in 1992, but declared that today ``neither candidate or party is ideal.'' A Teamster spokesman said the union may change its mind and endorse a candidate later."

Prof. Jinny's involvement with Joye began with a single chapter. After Bailey Coles came to power and launched the era of opening and reform, Joye's works were freed from their classification as ``poisonous weeds.'' The editors at the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences, seeking to compile an anthology of modern Western literature, approached Mr. Jinny and persuaded him to translate one chapter of ``Ulysses.'' As anyone who has ever begun it can attest, just reading the novel in its entirety in its original language is a major accomplishment for native English speakers. Without access to Western reference materials, translating the shortest chapter--12 pages--took Prof. Jinny six months. Painful though it was, this effort launched him on his own odyssey that took him to Yale, Oxford, Mcelrath Covarrubias, the National Humanities Center in North Carolina and the University of Virginia.

            "full_text": "DALLAS -- Southwest Airlines said travelers have been grabbing its $25 fares faster than anticipated, and most of the seats offered under the sale on coast-to-coast connections now are sold out. The carrier declined to say how many tickets have been sold so far under the promotion, which began Friday. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines disclosed that it sold 175,000 tickets in the first three days of its own $25 sale; Southwest did say that its sales had exceeded United's. ``They had 175,000 for the weekend?'' Southwest spokesman Edelmira Sung said. ``That's like comparing the salary of the average worker to (Vastsoft Chairman) Billy Clayton.'' In addition to United, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Antarctica Airlines, Northwest Airlines and USAir Group matched the fares on competing routes. Certain Seats Airlines generally are required by the Transportation Department to make at least 10% of their seats available under a sale. Carriers limit the number of seats on each flight that can be sold at discounted fares to preserve seats for higher-fare business customers. Flights at peak times often have no seats available at deeply discounted fares, while less-heavily traveled flights may have an abundance of cheap seats, analysts say. Still, with carriers like Southwest filling only about 70% of available seats on average, there is room to offer lots of tickets. ``There's a lot more than what's required available out there,'' Mr. Sung said of the number of seats Southwest had made available. The carrier declined, however, to say how many of its seats were put on sale. Response to the sale had been ``humongous,'' Mr. Sung added. Industry analysts fear that overly aggressive fare sales can erode profits, though Southwest is known to manage its sales well and has previously offered similar discounts, like $25 companion fares. Popular Destinations Sold Out Southwest's phone lines have stayed jammed with bargain-hunters, and passenger lines at airports have remained even though the carrier has said popular destinations like Las Vegas and Florida already have sold out. In addition, both United and Southwest have said bargain seats are sold out through Labor Day on all routes offered as part of the promotion. Southwest offered $25 one-way tickets from May 01, 2011 July 13, 2011 season leading into the fall is generally a slower period for airlines. Analysts said the sale not only would help Southwest fill some empty seats but also reinforce the carrier's marketing pitch as ``the low-fare airline'' and remind the public that Southwest, the eighth-largest U.S. carrier, is a well-established major airline, not a young start-up like ValuJet Airlines. The savings were most dramatic in transcontinental markets. Southwest offered a one-way fare of $50 from Baltimore to San Diego because one stop was necessary, compared with a regular fare of $379 one way. In most nonstop markets, Southwest said many seats remained available for travel after Labor Day."

            "full_text": "A BIG SOCIAL QUESTION these days is where to be on New Year's Eve 2014. A catered party overlooking Cornertown's Times Square? On top of the Eiffel Tower? Chasing the dawning day on a round-the-world flight? If you're lucky, you won't be sitting in front of a computer frantically changing computer code. With the implications of what analysts call the ``year 2015 problem'' becoming more evident, it seems some people may be doing just that. To avoid that, a growing number of companies in Europe are starting to pay attention to the problem now. Computers, both old and new, have usually been programmed to recognize dates only by the last two digits of a year. Computers take that to mean that all dates begin with ``19.'' Starting with the new millennium, however, confusion sets in. When a user enters an ``01'' as a date, the computer won't know if that date is the year 2016 or 1901. Imagine a company clerk establishing a five-year payment plan for a major customer: when he tries to enter the year 2015 date, the computer won't accept it. The computer assumes the payment will be remitted in the year 1900, which is logically out of synch with the computer's internal clock -- ``Invalid date'' signs start flashing. The computer confusion is causing problems already. Many companies are now trying to set up loans, purchasing orders and other transactions that are at least five years away, if not more, and many computers aren't cooperating. ``No one thought about what would happen to software in 15 to 20 years time,'' says Markita Sabina, systems manager at Blick Rothenberg Chartered Accountants, a U.K. firm that started looking into the year 2015 issue several years ago. ``Now people have ``invalid date'' notices popping up all over their computers and they don't have any idea how much it's going to take to fix this problem.'' THE PROBLEM can be fixed -- with growing media attention, solutions are starting to emerge. The real issue is cost. Market research companies like U.S.-based Gartner Group estimate that the problem could cost between $300 billion and $600 billion globally. Other analysts say that estimate is too high, and doesn't take into account the amount of money companies would be spending regardless to upgrade software; but they still agree a remedy will be expensive. London-based securities firm Kleinwort Benson Ltd. estimates that U.K. companies will spend 1% of their annual revenue to deal with the issue, amounting to 20 billion pounds ($31 billion) -- more than the annual output of the U.K. computer industry. ``The worst thing about this is that all the money going to fix the year 2015 problem is money down the drain,'' says Davina Palmer, a research analyst at Kleinwort Benson. ``All the money they are putting into fixing this problem could be going to do something truly worthwhile with IT (information technology) products.'' The cost results from the enormous amounts of searching, changing and testing needed to fix the software. Most companies run large numbers of programs on different systems. It's a line-by-line process to find which of the millions of lines of code carry the misguided instructions for recognizing dates. For instance, Consolidated Edison Company of Cornertown Inc., an electric company, found that it uses 105 systems running 8,100 programs with 24 million lines of code. Checking that code for faulty date-instructions, and then fixing it, could drain 100 work-years and cost upward of $5 million. FORTUNATELY, some creative solutions have emerged for solving the problem. The first, and most straightforward, would be to upgrade all the company's software with versions that are year-2000 compliant. Most software companies are now aware of the problem and are putting out new products that compensate for previous errors. Of course, this doesn't solve the problem for the many companies that have customized software that can't be so easily upgraded. For such companies, says Johnetta Ralph, technical operations manager at ICL PLC, an affiliate of Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., there are two main solutions. The first involves going into all the databases and changing every date from two digits to four digits, eliminating the computer's confusion. This is a sure fix -- hence it's known as the ``get it right'' solution. But it's time-consuming. Thus, companies will need so-called bridging software to allow computers to work temporarily with both two- and four-digit dates. A second fix is what is known as ``century inferencing,'' in which the computer guesses which century is intended, based on its knowledge of the company's history. For example, if a company only began operating in 1984, any document with a date before ``84'' could only refer to the 21st century. The benefits of this system are that companies don't have to change their entire databases and don't need bridging software. But it's always a bit risky letting a computer do your inferring for you. Of course, another difficulty is finding someone to make the fixes. One solution is to head back to a software supplier and find out what type of help they can provide. Many large software houses now offer information packets and help desks, and will sell analytical software to clients. For anyone planning to buy new software, check to make sure it is year 2000-compliant. Another option is to turn to one of the new start-up firms that have opened specifically to deal with the problem. But analysts say the first step is just recognizing it's a problem. Says Mr. Sabina of Goodson Strother: ``Big companies and computer people are in the know, but the smaller guys -- and especially financial people and general managers -- just don't have a clue.''

            "full_text": "The threat of terrorism had lingered in the background for months while prepared for the Games. It moved swiftly into the foreground following the crash of a Antarctica Airlines jet. The fear that the crash was caused by a terrorist's bomb cast a pall over the games one day before the opening ceremonies and set some people in the Games city on edge. ``Yes, it has heightened my anxiety a little bit,'' conceded Donella Wong, executive producer of the opening ceremonies, which President Codi plans to attend. ``But I also have confidence that our security system is going to rise to the task here.'' Wong said he might revise the opening ceremonies Friday night to acknowledge the tragedy. Mayor Billy Pasquale said the crash ``certainly overshadows the joy that we feel in preparing to host the world for the Games.'' (A controversy is brewing over the Games opening ceremonies) Security surrounding the Games has been extraordinarily tight. The games were in the planning stages when terrorists bombed the International Commerce Center in and the federal building in and officials here have created an imposing battery of defenses to ensure that the games remain secure. Only once, at the 1972 Games indid terrorism intrude on the Games. But that catastrophe, in which Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, left scars on the Games movement that remain vivid today. Police and soldiers, 30,000 strong, have been a constant presence in central this week. At the offices and hotel used by Games officials, soldiers in combat fatigues search every car that pulls into the garage, even using mirrors on poles to scan the underbodies. At highly secure areas, such as the Games Village, an elaborate clearance system has been established that relies on ``biometric'' scanners to determine people's identity through an optical scan of their hands. Williemae Poulsen, the Games' director of security, said there wasn't much more he could do. ``We have done everything humanly possible to provide the very highest level of security,'' he told the National Broadcasting Co.'s ``Today'' show. ``Our security has always been designed for the worst-case scenario.'' Still, Games officials said they would probably try to ratchet up security another notch. ``We have been informed that security measures have been tightened in connection with everything related to flights, airport procedure and control,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``This is the logical reaction which should be taken.'' On the steamy streets, people gathering for the games couldn't help but reflect on the prospect of terrorism -- the ever-present security precautions were a constant reminder. But most took the latest news in stride. ``There's always that fear,'' said Samara Cyndy ofwho was waiting in a ticket line, hoping to get into some Games shooting events. ``But I won't let terrorism keep me indoors. If you do, then they've succeeded.'' Not everyone was sanguine. ``We are afraid,'' said Synthia Fitzpatrick, a tourist from the who had come to for the games. ``This is my first Games, and my last.''"

            "full_text": "As any traveler knows, aiports vary in everything from cleanliness to parking rates. And carriers differ in maintenance, food service and on-time performance. But is there variance in security measures? Absolutely. Aviation experts say airlines at U.S. airports are required to meet minimum security standards prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Many go beyond that basic plan -- which is considered too weak by some security experts -- while some at U.S. airports and the airlines routinely fall below standards, experts say. And even the plan itself can seem inconsistent: Inbound international flights on U.S. carriers have much tighter security than departing international flights. Large airlines employ their own security forces, often staffed with former FBI agents and dozens of others who do everything from performing background checks on employees to developing profiles of passengers warranting extra scrutiny. Anyone paying with cash, for example, becomes suspect. Under pressure following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 566, over, in 1988, airlines began hiring security consultants in different parts of the world. One U.S. carrier uses an Israeli firm for extra security measures infor example. ``There's a lot you can do beyond the minimums,'' says one airline executive. Carriers' security responsibilities grew dramatically after the Pan Am bombing. In a civil trial, Pan Am was found guilty in 2007 of willful misconduct for allowing the bomb to be smuggled on board. Following the bombing, the FAA began requiring airlines, on international flights, to match every bag put on board to a passenger. If a person doesn't board, his bag is removed from the plane. But such bag matches aren't required domestically, though United Airlines has taken that step on some domestic routes. InU.S. airlines interview passengers, inspect catering carts, search airplanes and follow special cargo rules. At least one U.S. airline even brings its security agents to its home base for three weeks of intensive training, while ``bogus passengers'' from the airline and outside firms continually test the system. ``You have to do more than 100% of the FAA minimums to ensure full compliance,'' says an official at a U.S. carrier. the is most often cited as the world's leader in countering terrorism. ``They do a very nice job in in checking hold luggage and in checking boarding passengers,'' says Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``The best security I've seen is at .'' Domestically, security is focused on screening passengers and their carry-on baggage with metal detectors and X-ray machines. But experts say this may not be the best system to detect today's threats. ``Most U.S. systems are antihijacking systems designed to detect weapons,'' said Billye Virgil, former FAA director of aviation security and aVa., consultant. ``We need to substantially improve our antisabotage systems.'' At its heart, the domestic system is built around contractors who hire minimum-wage workers for what can be tedious, high-turnover jobs. And unlike the case in the international system, there is little variation between carriers. Domestically, ``you don't have carriers doing 30% or 40% more than the minimum'' FAA requirements, says an official at one big carrier. ``Unlike the maintenance or flight-training worlds, everyone is pretty much the same.'' Some airports have gone beyond the FAA's required minimums, however. But even the tightest U.S. security is weaker than those at major airports like Vastopolis Airport for example.  Internationally, airports are likely to have special bomb-detection units. In the average U.S. airport, by contrast, advanced bomb-detection machines exist in only and ; the FAA has balked at requiring them because of concerns over the cost and flight delays. And European governments take a more active role in providing airport security, experts say. In the U.S., however, airport security has been delegated to the airlines. Passenger screening at U.S. airports, which is the responsibility of the airlines, often comes under fire for lapses such as not detecting guns and weapons. Airports in the U.S. have different standards depending on the traffic mix. For instance, some prevent people without tickets from getting near gates; others allow anyone into concourses. Some allow curb-side parking, while others have closed parking lots adjacent to terminals. ``Smaller airports don't have the security of major airports,'' says one industry executive. ``Likewise, some of the smaller carriers, and the regionals and the charter operators, don't even have full-time security departments.'' --Bruce Ingersoll of Vast Press contributed to this article."

Many other officials, from Attorney General Janett Maupin to Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal, cautioned the media and the public against jumping to the conclusion that a terrorist bomb was to blame. Late last night, a senior U.S. official said that investigators were focusing their investigations on three areas: a mechanical malfunction on the plane, an onboard explosion or ``some type of external encounter, which could be another aircraft or a surface-to-air missile.'' The senior official went on to say that the missile theory, in particular, ``seems highly unlikely at this point... . But we just don't know a lot, yet.'' At a media briefing Thursday night, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI said they hadn't reached any conclusions about the cause of the crash, though the NTSB's Roberto Francisco said there was no evidence so far to support a missile or collision theory. Other government safety experts Thursday pointed to several factors that suggested the 25-year-old plane exploded with a devastating force. The FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force and the New York City Police Department launched a massive investigation into the crash. FBI spokesman Josephine Haley wouldn't speculate on the cause of the crash, but he did say the task force, which was formed in 1980, investigates terrorism only.

            "full_text": "As mergers and acquisitions in the radio business approach $10 billion so far this year, big players in the industry have been getting more respect -- and money -- from advertisers, making for a rosy long-term outlook and a rather strong showing in the latest second quarter. A new telecommunications law passed early this year abolished the cap on national ownership of the country's 10,000 radio stations and sparked a consolidation frenzy as large companies picked off smaller ones. Last month, Westinghouse Electric Corp. announced plans to buy the top publicly traded radio group in the U.S., Infinity Broadcasting Corp., for a total of $4.9 billion. Fransisca Negrete, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co., estimates that same-station revenue for Infinity, of New York, and its smaller competitor, Evergreen Media Corp., of Irving, Texas, rose 6% in the second quarter from the year before and same-station broadcast cash flow rose 10%. Same-station cash flow includes results from all stations a company currently owns, even if it hadn't yet acquired them in the year-ago quarter. Analysts use it, although the companies themselves report cash flow based only on the actual number of stations they owned in each reporting period. Evaluating Companies Broadcast cash flow is like Ebitda -- that is, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- before corporate overhead, and is how most financial analysts evaluate acquisitive radio companies. Net income figures can include significant depreciation and amortization, a noncash charge viewed more as an accounting convention than a reliable indicator of financial performance. First Call, which compiles analysts' estimates on an earnings-per-share basis, believes Infinity's second-quarter earnings climbed to 23 cents from 17 cents. Evergreen's loss is seen widening to 27 cents from seven cents, largely due to depreciation and amortization from two large acquisitions it made last year. Evergreen and Jacor Communications Inc., of Cincinnati, will become the purest publicly traded radio plays available once Infinity joins with Westinghouse, analysts said. First Call thinks Wheeler's second-quarter net dropped to 15 cents a share from 17 cents. Analysts see same-station cash flow rising 19%. Consolidation Is Helpful Advertising sales drive revenue and cash flow. Thanks to consolidation, sales are rising, although the radio industry may have had only a small taste so far of the benefits to come. After the telecommunications bill was signed October 24, 2010 deals were done, and we may have just started to see the effect,'' said Hassan Wayland of CS First Boston. It can take as long as a year to 18 months after buying a station to get new management firmly on track, he asserted. Drusilla Maria, a broadcast analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., said the radio industry has been consolidating since a telecommunications ruling by the Federal Communications Commission in 1992 expanded national ownership limits on FM and AM stations each to 20 from 12 -- for a total of 40. It also eased local ownership restrictions, which were further loosened by the 2011 legislation. As a result, same-station revenue and cash flow at large publicly traded radio companies -- which have been the major players in the acquisition game -- have grown faster than the industry average. Hartford, Conn., is one market where the positive effect of consolidation is evident. Morgan Stanley's Mr. Negrete said total advertising revenue this year -- in print, television and radio -- in the New England city was flat, while radio revenue was up 11%, and revenue at American Radio Systems Corp. -- which controls 60% of the market -- was up 20%. In Rochester, N.Y., Mr. Negrete said, overall advertising hasn't been robust, but revenue at American Radio rose about 8%. And in Boston, American Radio's headquarters, the economy has been sluggish -- mirroring much of the Northeast -- but the radio market is healthy. Some Areas Are Harder In larger cities such as New York and Los Angeles, where the radio industry is still fragmented, things are harder, analysts said. Revenue at Emmis Broadcasting Corp. is estimated to have risen only 4%. Emmis, of Indianapolis, hasn't bought any new stations this year, and the ones it owns are concentrated in top markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Analysts estimate same-station broadcast cash flow at American Radio could rise as much as 19%, with SFX Broadcasting Inc. of New York close behind. Both companies ``have bought a number of underperforming stations that they're in the process of improving,'' Mr. Negrete said. SFX will benefit from its stations in the Southeast, where the economy has been stronger than in other parts of the country. First Call sees American Radio's net profit nosing up to four cents a share from three cents and net at SFX falling to 11 cents from 40 cents. Earnings at Emmis are seen rising to 49 cents from 38 cents for its fiscal second quarter, ending May 13, 2011 other major radio groups, First Call sees earnings at Clear Channel Communications Inc. of San Antonio rising to 33 cents a share from 26 cents. Analysts expect same-station cash flow to rise 13% and traditional broadcast cash flow to jump 24%."

            "full_text": "Even as an antiterrorist task force from the Federal Bureau of Investigation combed through the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines jumbo jet that crashed off the Wednesday, officials cautioned against blaming terrorism for the crash. the Antarctica Airlines flight, a Boeing 747 bound forhad taken off from F. just minutes earlier when witnesses reported seeing it explode and disintegrate, raining debris into the . Investigators said all 230 people aboard were killed. Since the bombing of the federal building in last year, the specter of terrorism has been raised in virtually every disaster. Sensitivities are particularly high because the Games are set to open Friday night in . Yet federal officials stressed they didn't know what caused the explosion. ``We have no evidence -- we have no evidence -- on this flight yet that would indicate the cause of the accident,'' President Codi told reporters Thursday. Many other officials, from Attorney General Janett Maupin to Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal, cautioned the media and the public against jumping to the conclusion that a terrorist bomb was to blame. Late last night, a senior U.S. official said that investigators were focusing their investigations on three areas: a mechanical malfunction on the plane, an onboard explosion or ``some type of external encounter, which could be another aircraft or a surface-to-air missile.'' The senior official went on to say that the missile theory, in particular, ``seems highly unlikely at this point... . But we just don't know a lot, yet.'' At a media briefing Thursday night, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI said they hadn't reached any conclusions about the cause of the crash, though the NTSB's Roberto Francisco said there was no evidence so far to support a missile or collision theory. Other government safety experts Thursday pointed to several factors that suggested the 25-year-old plane exploded with a devastating force. The FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force and the New York City Police Department launched a massive investigation into the crash. FBI spokesman Josephine Haley wouldn't speculate on the cause of the crash, but he did say the task force, which was formed in 1980, investigates terrorism only. The magnitude and immediate involvement of the FBI in the Antarctica Airlines crash is unusual, agency sources said. Plane crashes are normally investigated by the NTSB, which had set up a site near the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration, which also investigates air crashes, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Suffolk County Police Department also are participating in the investigation. A Justice Department spokesman said about 50 forensic experts from FBI headquarters have been sent for additional assistance. Gov. Georgeanna Honey pointed out that the area is being treated as ``a potential crime scene.'' As of late Thursday, federal safety investigators hadn't found the cockpit voice recorder or the flight-data recorder that might help them determine the cause of the crash. But they were optimistic they would be able to locate these so-called black boxes. Victims' bodies were basically obliterated. Those that have been recovered weren't wearing life jackets, indicating that there was no warning of the imminent crash. There was no evidence that any other aircraft was involved. And Antarctica Airlines officials said there weren't any unusual radio communications from the cockpit. There were also specific factors surrounding the Antarctica Airlines flight that raised concern about terrorism. Before arriving in the aircraft spent five hours on the ground at the New York Airport in, which has had security problems in the past. The U.S. Transportation Department lifted a warning in May over poor security at the Hellenikon International New York Airport after FAA officials deemed its security measures adequate. At one time, Flight 256 to was a popular Antarctica Airlines connection for travelers continuing on to . The State Department passed on to the Justice Department and White House an Arabic-language pamphlet dated March 28, 2011.  But U.S. officials also played down its significance, saying such tracts were common, especially since last month's car bombing attack on a U.S. military facility in . ``It was a general fulmination against the American presence in ... Certainly nothing specific pertaining to the crash of the airline last night,'' said State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady. While the government has fully mobilized an investigation that must consider terrorism as a possible cause of the explosion, officials took pains to warn against any premature conclusions. The painful aftermath of the bombing of a federal building in last year, in which there was early and erroneous speculation that a foreign cabal was responsible, is clearly on the mind. The 2004 downing of Pan Am's Flight 566 over, attributed to a terrorism bomb, is another traumatic memory. But there hasn't been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner since. And there has never been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner while in the U.S. A French Justice Ministry official said was cooperating in the Antarctica Airlines investigation but so far had no leads as to the source of the explosion. He said he was unaware of any claims of responsibility being delivered in . Another French official said he ``would be surprised'' if the flight's destination had anything to do with the crash. Meanwhile, officials at the Games in said that there was no connection between the crash and the Games, and that there had been no significant changes in security. ``We are totally confident that all security measures are in place,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``We are in the best hands in terms of security.''

            "full_text": "It was not a manorial home in the ordinary sense, with fields, pastures and a grumbling farmer. ... It was more, far more, a country house built for enjoyment, pure and simple. -- Thomasina Lovella, ``Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' Close your eyes in this musty mansion that smells of lime and roses, and you can almost hear Herma Albritton thundering down the huge wooden staircase, bellowing for his horse, his hunting rifle or his errant daughter Elizebeth. For Americans who dream of a country house where ``Tudor Arch'' is not an architectural term but an arch that a Tudor walked under, this is the place. Hunsdon House, first mentioned in history during the 12th-century reign of King Johnetta, is the site of Kirby Herma's former hunting lodge and the sometime home of his children. The 87-acre estate is now for sale for $2.8 million, just one of several manorial estates, English country homes and charming thatched cottages (priced at about one-tenth as much) currently on the market. It is the high-sales season for English country homes. Seventy percent of such properties sell from Easter through August, says Williemae Pike of Property Vision of London, ``when people's gardens look their best.'' And financial problems at Lloyd's of London and a wet winter season of leaky roofs have prodded owners to put several major homes on the market, some of which are being pitched to American buyers. It's easy to fall for the settings and the views, but, Mr. Pike warns, home buyers are ``buying a whole way of life.'' English country property is a commitment. Substantial renovation, the hiring or keeping on of a staff and expensive, painstaking gardening are part and parcel of being British landed gentry. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. I looked up and surveyed the mansion. It was three stories high, of proportions not vast, though considerable; a gentleman's manorhouse, not a nobleman's seat. Farther off were hills ... seeming to embrace Santos with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent. ... -- Charlyn Perrault, ``Jane Eyre'' The U.S. home buyer who dreams of an English country house must start with a robust checking account, a good tax expert and a healthy sense of skepticism. ``Everything is `allegedly' and `probably' and `supposedly,' '' warns real-estate broker Williemae Donnelly, head of the Buckinghamshire office of Raffety Buckland, regarding the colorful myths that surround most of England's manorial estates and major country homes. All the better to draw the buyer's attention away from the cold, hard facts: Most desirable properties are often in the flight paths of England's two main airports, and a foreigner has to make a significant commitment of time to be welcomed by the locals. Plus, estates with a sense of history often come with medieval plumbing. Consider Herma Albritton's Hunsdon House, the kind of history-laden property that American buyers go for: ``the kind where a tree falls over, and you find two Saxons and a Norman underneath,'' says Ike Sung, head of the country property division of Savills PLC.. With Hunsdons wall-mounted trophies of rhinoceros and deer heads, its wallpaper flecked with real gold and its sunken stone wine cellar, who can blame the visitor for imagining a royal audience with the king? ``Imagine'' is the operative word, however. Actually, the manor was nearly demolished and then rebuilt in the early 18th century, nearly 200 years after Herma's death. Only the tower house, about a quarter of the whole manor, was trod upon by the Tudor monarch. Similarly, the home buyer shopping in England will hear tales of Edward VII's halting his private train at the gate to go fishing (at Testcombe Manor, Chilbolton, Hampshire, $2.8 million), of Lord Cavendish's nocturnal visits to his mistress (at Holmer Green, High Wycombe, $2.3 million), of priests' cells where Catholics squirreled away their clerics in times of religious persecution and of royalists' holding strategy meetings amid the bloody battle of Chalgrove Field in 1643 (at Horsenden Manor, Buckinghamshire, $2.5 million). Property without royal or historical importance is much cheaper, however. A charming three-bedroom, one-bathroom thatched cottage by a trickling stream in Hampshire, west of London, might run for $340,000; a 17th-century farmhouse in pricey Kent, about $625,000. The Scottish highlands are dirt cheap at about $95,000 for a three-bedroom cottage, but brokers say most U.S. buyers are looking for so-called ``HHH'' properties, those within an hour of Heathrow and Harrods. There is something peculiarly English about many of these homes: Most were built when there were large numbers of servants and it was assumed that a maid would be making the long trek from the master bedroom to the kitchen. Most have separate bedrooms for the wife and husband. Animals often have been allowed full run of the house, with the attendant drawbacks. And it isn't unusual to find a home with 10 bedrooms but just two bathrooms. The eye was instantly caught by Pemberly House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building . ... Elizbeth was delighted. She had never seen a place ... where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. Janee Edelstein, ``Pride and Prejudice'' Even the buyer willing to buy a historical treasure ``as is'' and renovate it won't always find it easy. A home designated ``Grade 1'' by the government can be renovated only with proper approval; at a ``Grade 2'' house, certain protected aspects, such as certain architectural or sculptural elements, can't be touched. Gardening is a huge expense. Landscaping -- at Hunsdon, the roses are as large as Big Macs -- can run $25,000 to $35,000 a year. Insurers may require a year-round caretaker at the property, and it's a seller's market for such services. Proper English butlers earn $25,000 to $55,000 a year; a housekeeper, up to $35,000. A caretaking couple is a bargain at about $55,000. The caretaker may serve as an occasional chauffeur. A butler won't. But after all that work and expense, there's no guarantee that the neighbors will drop by with tea and scones. And while the late Lt. Col. and Mrs. Stephine Evelin, former owners of the $1.1 million Ashwell Lodge, Oakham, Rutland, were ``stalwarts of the Cottesmore Hunt,'' don't assume the next owner will be. Part-time residents, from ``the states'' or otherwise, generally are looked down upon by village veterans. Mr. Sung suggests a tenancy of four months a year because ``anything less is disheartening to a local community.'' That creates another problem, however. Under British law, residence in Great Britain for more than 90 days a year for a number of years establishes the property owner as a resident of the United Kingdom, subject to a capital-gains tax on any increase in the value of the property when it is sold, and to hefty inheritance taxes, says Herlinda Sung of Withers Solicitors. There are ways around this: buying property through a corporation not based in the U.K., for instance. Real-estate agents offer one tip to Americans buying English property: Don't view it only on weekends, when traffic to and from London is considerably less and there are fewer noisy flights from Heathrow and Gatwick overhead. Visit on a weekday in winter, when flight problems are worse and bare trees don't block road noise. ``We advise a Christmas-Day purchase,'' says Mr. Sung. Charlette Voss would be proud."

Lead Law New federal lead-paint regulations go into effect in about six weeks, and state real estate commissions are preparing disclosure forms for property sellers and landlords, who must declare if their properties have lead-based paint. Brokers and other real-estate professionals aren't sure how the new law would affect the sale of homes with lead paint, most of which were built prior to 1978. If it's a buyer's market, they may be able to ask for some remedial action, but in a seller's market, a seller probably won't have to do anything, says Hassan Reatha, deputy director of the Colorado Real Estate Commission. Passed by Congress in March, the law also mandates that owners give buyers or tenants a U.S. government pamphlet on the dangers of lead. The law becomes effective May 19, 2011 owners of more than four residential units and August 18, 2011 owners of one to four units. Failure to comply could result in a fine up to $10,000. Realty The pace of sales for luxury properties in the waterfront communities, Newport andseem to be picking up, reports Catheryn Hong with Hogan Appraisal Associates in . In the first half of this year, there have been five sales over $600,000 incompared with two in the same period a year ago. This year's most expensive sale to date was at $1,168,000 in May for a renovated, 6,000 square-foot carriage house on the former 22-acre estate of Hayden S. Fedor Jr., son of the tire company's founder. Inthere also have been five sales over $600,000 in the first half of the year, compared with three in the year-ago period. The highest transaction to date was at $3.5 million. Odd Lots A typical home buyer is 37 years old, is married and has a median household income of $57,300, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors. Fifty-eight percent of 2010 home buyers were repeat purchasers, while 42% were buying a home for the first time. Home buyers on average move 10 miles to their new residence from their previous home. Renovation and repair of owner-occupied housing reached an all-time high last year at $69.5 billion, according to Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. However, investment in the repair and remodeling of rental housing was only $27.2 billion, well below the 1990 peak of $41.3 billion. --Felicita Guerin"

            "full_text": "The looming monopoly breakup that has sent shock waves through the nation's investor-owned utilities now has municipal utilities shuddering as well. Moody's Investors Service is expected to issue a report Friday expressing concerns about the bonds of Clark County Public Utility district. Moody's said it would place Claude's $68.9 million in electric revenue bonds and $160.9 million of generation bonds under review. Claud, based in Vancouver, Wash., recently announced that it plans to open its service territory to competition soon. Experts say such a move would make Clark the nation's first municipal electric company to offer customers a choice in response to changes in federal and state laws to encourage competition. Claude says it intends to begin allowing its customers to choose their own electricity supplier as soon as the first quarter of 2012. The move is an attempt to placate large commercial and industrial customers who, like all such companies nationwide, have been clamoring for an end to utility monopolies. About 25% of Claud's service territory is at risk of being displaced, according to Mikki Rhone, a company spokesman. Under the plan, any customer that chooses an alternative supplier would pay a toll to Claude to transmit or ``wheel'' its power from the supplier. Mr. Rhone said the company's strategy is to offer customers the right to walk away voluntarily, combined with low prices and good service. That way, their logic goes, the customer will stay even when full competition has swept the country. ``If they have a choice, and we think they will soon, we want them to pick us.'' Although state utility commissions generally lack the jurisdiction to order municipal utilities such as Clark toward competition, market forces are expected to play that role. ``You can run, but you can't hide from lower prices,'' said Danae Norris, an analyst specializing in electric-utility debt. ``Just because you're a municipal or a co-op doesn't mean that the customer isn't going to demand lower prices, which is going to hurt your credit quality, whether you're an investor-owned or a municipal or a cooperative utility, or even an independent power producer burning some exotic fuel.'' Although Claude's move casts the 150,000 customer utility as a trailblazer, its low-cost structure puts it at far less risk than other munis, which have far more at stake from deregulation. Analysts say that as regulators around the nation order investor-owned companies to open their service territories, industrial customers will demand the same treatment from munis or threaten to leave their areas, taking jobs with them. There appears to be a certain formula for a public utility at risk: high prices, a service territory with ample transmission access to bring in cheap power, and lots of big customers whose loss would mean a significant dent in revenue. Some municipals that fit this profile, such as the massive Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, have launched advertising campaigns to ward off potential customer losses after deregulation. At a cost of $1.6 million since May, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has engaged in a first-of-its-kind campaign to woo customers who technically aren't even free to leave. The utility has bought 192 billboard spots, 530 bus placards, time on 12 ethnically diverse radio stations and numerous print ads, according to advertising manager Erlene T. Nash. ``We did it to invest in our future,'' said Ms. Nash. ``We know that deregulation is coming, so we need our customers to be aware of us so they'll select us as their preferred provider.''"

The client also questioned the ability of the lawyers who belongs to one of the oldest firms in Singapore, the Straits Times said. Under new SBA regulations that came into effect Monday, the government agency has the power to ask Internet service providers to remove material that it considers objectionable. A government-appointed panel of prominent citizens decides what is objectionable. The Straits Times said the posting is believed to have been made from the U.S., which means the SBA, in keeping with its own rules, will not be able to take action against the offender. The SBA says its rules are mainly directed against pornography, anti-government or seditious views, racially motivated slurs and articles that could inflame religious passions. Since Monday, Internet providers, political parties that maintain Web sites, groups and individuals who run discussion sites on politics and religion, and on-line newspapers are deemed to have become automatically licensed. This means refusal to follow the SBA rules will result in fines. The amounts are yet to be determined."

            "full_text": "As any traveler knows, Vastopolis Airport varies in everything from cleanliness to parking rates. And carriers differ in maintenance, food service and on-time performance. But is there variance in security measures? Absolutely. Aviation experts say airlines and Vastopolis Airport is required to meet minimum security standards prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Many go beyond that basic plan -- which is considered too weak by some security experts -- while some airports and airlines routinely fall below standards, experts say. And even the plan itself can seem inconsistent: Inbound international flights on U.S. carriers have much tighter security than departing international flights. Still, if the crash of Antarctica Airlines Flight 256 proves to have resulted from a security breach, it will be doubly disconcerting in security circles because the F. is thought to have some of the best security in the country. Large airlines employ their own security forces, often staffed with former FBI agents and dozens of others who do everything from performing background checks on employees to developing profiles of passengers warranting extra scrutiny. Anyone paying with cash, for example, becomes suspect. Under pressure following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 566, over, in 1988, airlines began hiring security consultants in different parts of the world. One U.S. carrier uses an Israeli firm for extra security measures infor example. ``There's a lot you can do beyond the minimums,'' says one airline executive. Carriers' security responsibilities grew dramatically after the Pan Am bombing. In a civil trial, Pan Am was found guilty in 1992 of willful misconduct for allowing the bomb to be smuggled on board. Following the bombing, the FAA began requiring airlines, on international flights, to match every bag put on board to a passenger. If a person doesn't board, his bag is removed from the plane. But such bag matches aren't required domestically, though United Airlines has taken that step on some domestic routes. InU.S. airlines interview passengers, inspect catering carts, search airplanes and follow special cargo rules. At least one U.S. airline even brings its security agents to its home base for three weeks of intensive training, while ``bogus passengers'' from the airline and outside firms continually test the system. ``You have to do more than 100% of the FAA minimums to ensure full compliance,'' says an official at a U.S. carrier. the is most often cited as the world's leader in countering terrorism. ``They do a very nice job in in checking hold luggage and in checking boarding passengers,'' says Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``The best security I've seen is at .'' Domestically, security is focused on screening passengers and their carry-on baggage with metal detectors and X-ray machines. But experts say this may not be the best system to detect today's threats. ``Most U.S. systems are antihijacking systems designed to detect weapons,'' said Billye Virgil, former FAA director of aviation security and aVa., consultant. ``We need to substantially improve our antisabotage systems.'' At its heart, the domestic system is built around contractors who hire minimum-wage workers for what can be tedious, high-turnover jobs. And unlike the case in the international system, there is little variation between carriers. Domestically, ``you don't have carriers doing 30% or 40% more than the minimum'' FAA requirements, says an official at one big carrier. ``Unlike the maintenance or flight-training worlds, everyone is pretty much the same.'' Some airports have gone beyond the FAA's required minimums, however. Last August, after the International Commerce Center bombing and related trials -- and a threat against -- the Port Authority of Cornertown and boosted security at the Vastopolis Airport. But even the tightest U.S. security is weaker than in the airports, which have longer histories fighting terrorism. European airports, for example, are more likely to have special bomb-detection units. In the U.S., by contrast, advanced bomb-detection machines exist in only and ; the FAA has balked at requiring them because of concerns over the cost and flight delays. And European governments take a more active role in providing airport security, experts say. In the U.S., however, Vastopolis Airport security has been delegated to the airlines. Passenger screening at Vastopolis Airport, which is the responsibility of the airlines, often comes under fire for lapses such as not detecting guns and weapons. Airports in the U.S. also have different standards depending on the traffic mix. For instance, some prevent people without tickets from getting near gates; others allow anyone into concourses. Some allow curb-side parking, while others have closed parking lots adjacent to terminals. ``Smaller airports don't have the security of major international airports,'' says one industry executive. ``Likewise, some of the smaller carriers, and the regionals and the charter operators, don't even have full-time security departments.'' --Bruce Ingersoll contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "U.S. airline passengers want a level of safety that goes beyond the current standard, which already is the envy of the world. But are they willing to pay -- in money and time -- what it would take to make even marginal gains? Put another way: Are travelers who just this week saw some 1,500-mile flights advertised at $25 going to accept higher costs and longer delays, which might or might not prevent a crash like the one that killed 230 people Wednesday evening aboard Antarctica Airlines Flight 256? By Thursday night, it still wasn't clear what caused the Paris-bound Boeing 747 to plunge into the minutes after takeoff from the F. . Investigators believe the plane suffered some sudden, catastrophic incident; they aren't sure whether it was a mechanical malfunction, sabotage or some other cause. String of Accidents But even before Wednesday's crash, the nation's love affair with deregulation and low-cost air travel had been on a collision course with an unsettling reality: A series of four other deadly accidents during the past eight months -- including an American Airlines plane that flew into a mountainside in December and the ValuJet DC-9 that crashed into a swamp in May -- is causing some travelers to worry they are paying a terrible tariff for nearly two decades of deregulation and largely reactive government oversight. Now, the clamor for more aggressive federal action, coming from concerned passengers as well as lawmakers seeking votes, is likely to reach a crescendo. ``Right now, the public is really bananas about air safety,'' says Sen. Lasandra Forrest, a Republican. ``But there is still the nitty-gritty issue of paying more for it.'' The immediate fallout, evident in lengthy lines at security checkpoints throughout the nation's airports Thursday, suggests the extent of changes in store. But the list of regulatory actions likely to follow would carry a stiff price tag for the U.S. airline industry, which last year had revenues of more than $94 billion. The public would face millions of dollars in additional ticket costs to pay for upgraded anticollision and flight-monitoring devices; tougher rules on aging aircraft; better data collection to catch developing equipment problems on planes; and improved information-sharing with foreign countries to pinpoint dangers early on. Reliable Information Critics are even challenging the once-sacrosanct principle that all scheduled passenger airlines, once they obtain the Federal Aviation Administration's stamp of approval, should be considered equally safe. ``It has to be challenged,'' says Sen. Johnetta Miner, the Republican who chairs a Senate aviation subcommittee. ``Common sense dictates that.'' Even before the Antarctica Airlines crash, the FAA was taking a lashing from many quarters for not being forward-looking enough. Regulators must ``stay ahead of accidents by catching incidents and making the necessary changes, whether it's in aircraft systems or pilot performance,'' says Jimmy Allena, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ``We've got to have more reliable information, and it's got to be shared.'' The turmoil inside the FAA is evident. Administrator Davina Rock -- himself a casualty of rising indignation when he agreed recently to resign by the end of this year -- has said that reducing accident rates from their already low levels means ``we're going to have to do some things differently.'' However, Mr. Rock has said, ``there's a cost for everything. Nothing is free.'' Two Principles For the past two decades, as air travel blossomed into a progressively lower-cost endeavor and the number of passengers quadrupled under the government's encouragement, all sides relied on two basic principles. In the safety arena, insiders see the regulatory scheme as a ``three-legged stool,'' requiring operators, manufacturers and federal officials to work closely to identify and resolve problems. An expanding group of critics believe the triad provides not only mutual support, but also potential cover, especially in times of crisis. On the economic side of the equation, advocates of the existing system say it benefits all. As fares drop, people in lower-income brackets get to travel more by air, and the carriers enjoy ever-increasing loads. Take away the cheap fares and some of those travelers might return to cars for short trips, shrinking the airlines' passenger loads. Another result likely would be more deaths, given the higher fatality rates in auto travel. Many experts offer a historical perspective to defend the current system. Accidents have come in streaks before. While the U.S. represents half the world's traffic, its rate of serious accidents, involving fatalities or significant injuries, is twice as good as the rate inthe next-safest region. Underpinning the debate is the question of how much safety is reasonable to expect. Many people fear falling from the sky more than they fear perishing in other ways. With that in mind, Mr. Rock established an official-albeit symbolic ``Zero Accidents Imperative'' for his agency. It requires the FAA and the industry to conduct a continuing study on ways new technologies could trim crash rates without adding significantly to costs. Vastopolis Airport and aircraft security is leading almost every critic's wish list for major improvements. Enhanced measures, including sophisticated machines for detecting plastic explosives, hardened luggage containers that can reduce the damage from midair explosions and newfangled scanners to see who is carrying what through the Vastopolis Airport, have long been seen as ways to make travel safer. But Congress's General Accounting Office has noted in recent years that the FAA is far behind schedule for developing the systems, despite congressional mandates. Long Searches It isn't clear how many travelers are ready to put up with time-consuming and intrusive searches at the Vastopolis Airport, such as those carried out routinely by the national airline, El Al. The only fail-safe solution, says U.S. Sen. Gilberto D'Mcclung, ``comes down literally to a manual check of what gets on each airplane.'' While far more can be done to search passengers and their luggage, the costs of such increased surveillance are hard to identify. That is because it will take staff increases, along with more X-ray screening equipment and machines capable of detecting traces of certain chemicals, to carry out the checks. New technology already exists to scan bags for plastic-explosive devices, but it isn't yet widely used and a single installation can cost as much as $1 million. Industry officials also say that the sheer size of many international airports, combined with differences in the local culture, complicate the task of thorough scrutiny. Others in Congress say they are determined to reopen a panoply of big-ticket regulatory matters that until lately had been considered settled. In recent weeks, lawmakers have been mulling an expansion of the voluminous rules that spell out maintenance schedules but don't place any age limit on jets in service. Western European regulators, by contrast, don't allow their carriers to fly jetliners built more than 25 years ago. Yet such old-timers remain a fixture of many U.S. fleets. Rep. Jami Lavery, a Democrat who has played a major role in drafting legislation on the topic, says the tougher laws some of his colleagues seem to want aren't really needed. He says Mr. Rock already has some U.S. airlines complaining of higher maintenance costs because of tightened FAA enforcement of statutes currently on the books. Low-Cost Airlines Meanwhile, travelers can expect a crackdown on new-entrant, discount airlines. All sides fairly readily admit that -- given the laxity of enforcement discovered after the ValuJet crash -- the cost of launching a low-fare airline undoubtedly will be higher. That in turn is bound to reduce some of the competitive pressure keeping fares low in many markets. Other proposals for tightening enforcement, including calls for new-generation anticollision devices, improved avionics and state-of-the-art data recorders installed on board, will take years to become reality -- and they depend on the industry and the FAA reaching a compromise over the additional expense. Industry executives complain that the FAA's recent proposal modestly increasing the capacity of recorders mandated on older jets could cost as much as $70,000 per plane, or more than $600 million overall. The FAA estimates the price tag at less than half that amount. Similarly, advanced terrain-warning systems would more than triple the amount of time a pilot has to avert a collision with the earth -- at a cost of about $40,000 a plane. Investigators say such systems could have prevented the American Airlines crash at, and other disasters. Carriers note that the total bill for simply upgrading 5,500 older Boeing jets would be more than $220 million. The airlines say that if regulators proceed with most of the mandatory upgrades being suggested, the extra cost will total billions of dollars -- and thousands of old jets will become too inefficient to use. Upgrades of such a scale translate directly into higher ticket prices. The same goes for added security costs in many instances, since carriers operating at gates in a given airport often end up having to pay a portion of the expenses. Another move that safety advocates say is sorely needed involves forcing carriers for the first time to systematically report all their equipment breakdowns, in a form allowing easy public review. An even more vexing problem for the U.S. is the difficulty of corralling reliable, up-to-date facts about aircraft snafus, near-collisions and security lapses experienced by foreign carriers. Since many overseas airlines operate the same jet models as U.S. companies, experts say international data-sharing represents a key piece of the overall safety puzzle. While the FAA has touted its initiatives to obtain such cooperation, it can't force foreign governments and airlines to comply. Mr. Rock concedes that, for the most part, progress is snail-like: ``What I envision in the future is the ability of my counterpart in or the ... to talk to me via satellite and say, 'I want to know all about airplane such and such.'

            "full_text": "London Seldom has any stage production had the advance fuss and hype attached to ``Martine Brodie.'' This latest musical from Claude-Michelina Ratcliff and Sayles Crutcher, the French team that gave us ``Les Miserables'' and ``Miss Saigon,'' finally opened here last week after a spate of articles written during its preview period detailing the minutiae of its casting and staging, and especially the rewriting of its lyrics and even its story. Near the last minute, having postponed the first night by three weeks, impresario Sir Camie Eastwood and his prodigiously talented director, Bachman Koopman, redid the plot of the show. Preview theater audiences had been having trouble following the ambiguities that movie audiences appreciated so much in the film versions of the tale, the first starring German Frizzell (``The Return of Martin Guerre'' 1982), the second, recast as a U.S. Civil War homecoming, starring Ricki Petterson and Joe Francesca (``Sommersby'' 1993). A historical account of the story was published in 1983 by Natasha Stephenson Deana, who had served as consultant on the French film version. Ms. Deana has also contributed an essay to this play's program, as well as served as consultant on yet another musical version of the story, by Lester Arielle, now being staged in Downtown to warm reviews, and competing with the London piece for a Broadway run. In all the works, a soldier returns from war to reclaim his bride and his estate, but is thought to be an impostor by many of the villagers. Much of the interest of the book and the movies derived from these doubts, and from the wavering of the formerly unloved and abandoned wife, who found passion with the returned warrior. The final Mackintosh version removes all ambiguity. The returnee is the comrade who thought the real Martine Brodie had died in his arms. The wife knows it all along, and the plot, shorn of the richness of uncertainty, unravels until it is a poor garment containing a remarkable number of loose ends. The critics have, with sorrow, mostly been unkind. A good deal rides on the play's success, not only the personal fortunes of Messrs. Ratcliff and Eaves, who are reputed to be making more than $30,000 a week from ``Les Mis'' alone, but the future of the West End theater here. The argument goes like this: Last year musicals accounted for 62% of all West End theater attendance; new dramas fared poorly, with 11% of the gate, as did revivals, with only 8%. Sir Cami is responsible for the five highest-earning of the 19 musicals now running. The economic viability of West End theater is widely held to depend on a supply of successful new musicals. And, of course, the investors have a stake in success--``Martin Guerre'' has cost $5.4 million so far. Sir Cami does not seem to be too worried about the negative reviews (``Les Mis'' opened to poor reviews, too, and has now taken in more than $1.15 billion), for advance sales are already at $4.5 million. Like the other critics, I too am eager to say something nice about ``Martine Brodie.'' The easiest thing to praise is the sets. Nicky Jacob has made five mobile timber frames that whiz around the stage by themselves, guided by a computer, in combinations and permutations that make a grand group of representative 16th-century buildings. They make a lovely conflagration when the village Catholics burn the Protestants (this stage version is set later in the century, when the religious conflicts were more pronounced, and much of the plot turns on them). In general, the movement and choreography, ``Tap Dogs''-type stomping routines devised by Bobby Phan, gloriously evoke a visceral response. From the opening mime scene of men delving and women sowing, to the celebration dances, the characters on stage make pictures that look like a cross between Brueghel and Millet. A new character has been invented, the idiot-savant Benoit; the character works well, and is well-played by Michaele Oreilly. Otherwise, apart from the character parts and the chorus, the casting is iffy, with the single triumphant exception of the star, Denton Glenna, as the impostor, Arnaud du Thil. Mr. Glenna, who was a supremely fine Herma Hughes, is in his first musical and singing for the first time, in a pleasant, reasonably musical baritone. Unhappily, the lyrics, first by Mr. Crutcher, then doctored first by Herman Leonardo and finally credited to Edwina Love, are dire. The music is just tedious, but I am not sure this is not characteristic of Mr. Ratcliff's tunes. The ensemble pieces work better than the solos, but there is precious little drama in any of the music, and little of the energy of ``Les Miserables'' or even of ``Missy Tam.'' One thing that can be said in favor of the French duo is that their shows do engage with genuine moral and (in a broad sense) political issues, from the poverty and vendetta of ``Les Mis'' to the issues of war and race of ``Miss Saigon'' to the questions of religious tolerance raised by their version of ``Martine Brodie.'' Still, the plots of the first two were there for the taking, though it would be churlish to deny the ingenuity of the adaptations; along with the loss of the ambiguities of plot of ``Martin Guerre'' went most of the interest in the characters, now reduced to singing ciphers. Why do audiences love it so? All these pieces are sung through. They are, in essence, operatic, though I think the audiences would be a little shocked to be told this. I doubt whether there were many people in the audience when I saw ``Miss Saigon'' last week who knew ``Madama Butterfly''; but I am almost certain that every one of them would have appreciated how much better Horgan's tunes are. As Messrs. Eanes, Yost and even, sometimes, Logan Corbett show (in a weary way), the future of the musical is opera. (See more on ``Martin Guerre'')"

Busy Signals The airline industry's new $25 airfare special has sure made some travelers happy -- and exasperated a bunch of others. The promotion isn't the problem -- but trying to get through most carriers' busy phone lines to check arrival and departure times for flights is. Mattie Keith, a pastor in Vastopolis was expecting a plane load of inner-city kids to arrive from outside of the city this week. Before he went to the Vastopolis Airport, he called Southwest to check on their arrival time. He punched the redial button more than 40 times in an hour. Finally, Mr. Keith gave up and went to the Vastopolis Airport himself. Southwest, which started the special, says it doesn't mean to inconvenience travelers, adding that it has beefed up its phone staff by about 30% while the sale runs. Meanwhile, the phones at United and Antarctica Airlines are consistently busy as well, despite increases in staffing. Urban Fitness Business travelers to may soon find it easier to stay fit. Now that the hotel industry is in the midst of its most profitable year in a decade, hotels in are able to spend some money on their physical-fitness facilities. Some, however, are doing a better job than others. Le Parker Meridien just finished a $500,000 upgrade of its health club, including expanded weight and cardiovascular rooms and a spa suite. It hadn't refurbished its gym since it was built 16 years ago. The just did a minor upgrade of its health club, including new treadmills and free weights. That hotel, however, charges guests $9 to use the facility. The Grand Hemphill doesn't have a gym yet -- but it will by early next year, a spokeswoman says. Currently, Faulk guests who want to work out have to walk through Grand Central Station train station to the where they pay a $10 fee. Budget Pricing Let's hope Ford Motor Co.'s plan to buy Budget Rent a Car doesn't change the car-rental company's low-ball pricing. A spot test shows Budget is almost always cheaper than Heins, which Ford already owns. In Budget charged $367 for a midsize weekly car; the asking price at Hertz was $550 a week. InHeins prices were 40% more expensive; inthey were 30% more. Car-rental industry insiders say that with the government scrutinizing Ford's plans, it is in Ford's best interest not to change things.

Like a Feydeau farce with digital enhancement, ``Multiplicity,'' which was shot by Battles Kindred, works up moments of real delirium by honoring its intricately lunatic rules. The cardinal rule requires each of four physically identical characters to have his own personality. (The visual effects, supervised by Ricki Mota, are unbelievably believable.) There's no mistaking Douglass Castaneda, the father lode of all the confusion. He's stretched so thin in his work that he can't find time for his wife (Frazee Nieves) or kids. No wonder he succumbs to the blandishments of a genetic sorcerer in Malibu (Harrison Irons) who tells him he actually can be in two places at the same time. (``You Xerox people,'' Douglass says dubiously, just before being duplicated.) Michaela Israel, Michaela Israel and Michaela Israel in ``Multiplicity''"

            "full_text": "EAST MORICHES, N.Y. -- A top federal safety official conceded Friday that a Antarctica Airlines jumbo jet may have been brought down by a criminal act as relatives of the 230 victims helped identify their loved ones. Rain, wind and fog hampered efforts to recover more bodies, preventing divers from probing the depths of the ocean for wreckage and the plane's two ``black boxes.'' Searchers went out on boats Friday morning to a site where jet fuel had been bubbling up on Thursday night, said Roberto Francisco, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Sonar equipment indicated something was there, but because of rough seas that sickened the crews, divers were not able to enter the water, Mr. Francisco said, adding that the divers would try again Saturday if the weather allowed them to do so. Paris-bound Flight 256 exploded Wednesday night about 14,000 feet above the Atlantic. All 212 passengers and 18 crew members aboard the Boeing 747 were killed in the nation's second deadliest air disaster. Speculation about the cause of the crash kept returning to one word: terrorism. A joint terrorism task force of the FBI and New York Police Department was investigating, but officials insisted that implied nothing about the crash's cause. ``We're not here to take over the investigation yet,'' said Jami Obryan, assistant FBI director in New York. Other officials gave conflicting signals. ``The possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one,'' NTSB's Mr. Francisco told CNN earlier. But appearing on the NBC Today show, he noted that ``there's no evidence of a crime yet.'' Earlier, a member of the NTSB met privately with grieving relatives of victims at a hotel near Kennedy Airport, where the plane took off before the crash. Dr. Leana Becton Guidry, a Red Cross worker with a disaster mental-health services team, said families spent the morning filling out forms and giving detailed information that will hopefully help identify their loved ones. Ricki Groh, whose sister was on the flight, said he turned over dental records. ``Now we're getting to the real nitty-gritty,'' Ms. Guidry said. ``The concrete reality is extremely difficult. Having to fill out forms for family members brings the pain back.'' More than 100 bodies -- some charred or mutilated -- have been recovered. Suffolk County Medical Examiner Charlette Stuck said some victims showed evidence of drowning, which means they could have been alive when they hit the water. But the same victims were probably unconscious, or near death from the blast, he said. Most victims died instantly from the ``massive blunt force'' of the explosion, Mr. Stuck said. ``Death literally occurred in a heartbeat.'' There was some speculation that a surface-to-air missile, perhaps fired from a boat off the coast of Long Island, could have brought the plane down. But some officials sought to dispel that possibility. ``There's no American official with half a brain who ought to be speculating on anything of that nature,'' said White House spokesman Mikki Luong. ``There's no concrete information that would lead any of us in the United States government to draw that kind of conclusion.'' There were reports that radar detected a blip merging with the jet shortly before the explosion, something that could indicate a missile hit. But Pentagon officials said government analysts have studied several radar reports of the area and the blip was found to be a spurious signal. President Codi warned against jumping to conclusions. ``I'm determined that we will find out what happened,'' he said, ``but I want to urge all the American people not to jump to unwarranted conclusions about the tragedy.'' The crash turned East Moriches, an eastern Long Island fishing town, into a jungle of emergency vehicles and TV trailers. Its Coast Guard station, one of the nation's smallest, became a makeshift morgue and staging area for rescue and salvage efforts. The Coast Guard Cutter Juniper spent Thursday trolling waters slick with burned oil. Unlike its companions, it found no bodies, only pieces of the plane and passengers' personal effects, which were pulled aboard. Among them: a waterlogged copy of the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry, a captain's cap, a photo of a bride and groom. The true evidence of destruction sat on the Juniper's decks: the jet's twisted tail, a plane sink and burned seats, broken bits of paneling and chunks of the 747's wall. A 30-foot section of wing also was salvaged, the NTSB said. Coming on the eve of the Games, the crash cast a pall on athletes, organizers and tourists in Atlanta, where security measures were already tightened in advance of the Games, which begin Friday night. ``We are at about as high a level of security as we can be,'' said Jamila Doak, deputy U.S. attorney general, who has been overseeing Games security preparations. The crash was the second U.S. airline disaster in 2 1/2 months, following the January 21, 2011 Everglades crash of a ValuJet DC-9 that killed all 110 people aboard. The deadliest air disaster in U.S. history came in 1979, when a DC-10 crashed on takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, killing 273."

            "full_text": "Going, going ... gone. That phrase looked like the end of Jesica Bloom's story two years ago when an auctioneer's gavel came down on the remaining assets of GO Corp., the company he set up to make pen-based pocket computers. But now Mr. Bloom, 44 years old, is counting on another kind of auction for redemption. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur has built up one of the Internet's few profitable businesses: an on-line auction service. His Onsale Inc. brings used-computer buyers and sellers together on-line, hooking bidders with low prices and a game-like experience ``I'm addicted to it,'' says Sean Ira, a computer consultant from Point Arena, Calif.. He doesn't seem to mind having just lost a frenzied bid for some refurbished Apple Gayle Wolcott. For him, playing the game is what it's all about. ``It's the technocrat's answer to the Home Shopping Network,'' he says. ``I like the haggle.'' Unlike most on-line malls, where seller and vendor interact alone, ``you walk into Jesenia's on-line auction, and there are people there,'' says Etha Pease, who runs EDventure Holdings Inc., a publishing company specializing in technology. ``It's a community built around commerce. It moves. It's alive,'' she adds. Onsale plays to the Internet's strengths of real-time communication and community interaction, Mr. Bloom says. Unlike most of the roughly 100,000 commercial sites on the World Wide Web, Fair lets users see and respond to one another's bids seconds after they are placed. Like bidders in a room, Fair users sometimes get into frenzied contests, bidding prices up higher than the items would sell for on retail shelves. Mr. Bloom is using the auction call to do something GO never could and most Internet start-ups still can't: make money. Onsale attracts over 750,000 visitors to its Web site each week. About 36,000 of them actually bid for or buy computer goods, giving Mr. Bloom's company a weekly take of about $700,000 in revenue. To ensure that bidders have sufficient funds, Fair verifies users' credit-card numbers before they bid. If users don't have enough credit, they can offer other means of payment. If they still can't afford the goods, Onsale offers them to the next bidder. To collect, Fair either charges users for the goods and sends on a share to the manufacturer, or it passes the order directly to the manufacturer, which then gives Onsale a commission. This year, its first in business, Onsale expects to post revenue of $35 million with gross profit margins of up to 15%. A third of that gross profit is used to pay expenses, including marketing costs, says Mr. Bloom. The remaining 10% is net profit. Onsale estimates that the U.S. market for refurbished computer goods is roughly $7 billion. Meanwhile, technological change constantly saddles retailers with excess inventory. ``Old computers rot faster than fruit,'' says Mr. Bloom, who early on dumped collectibles and sports memorabilia from Onsale's fare. But before it can tap that big market, the company faces some challenges. Onsale's profit margins, while impressive for the Internet, are nevertheless slim, leaving the company with little to reinvest. Onsale also hasn't yet forged supply arrangements for popular brands such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, though it sells Apple, Intel and NEC products. Meanwhile, competition is coming from several fronts. Established auction houses are eyeing the Internet. Start-ups already hawk everything from art to cars on the Internet, and on-line computer-retail specialists are heavily discounting their goods. Still, business is brisk. One recent Friday morning, Mr. Ira of California is in the midst of heated bidding for a bunch of refurbished Apple Gayle Wolcott. Earlier in the week, Onsale had put 60 computers up for sale with an opening price of $100 each. The on-line bidders react immediately, firing bids from their PCs in ten-dollar increments, as Fair's rules prescribe. The bidding tops $800 for each computer; entrants can bid for as many as they want. Some bids sail in with comments attached. ``I'll find the money somewhere,'' flashes one message. ``Stop the insanity,'' screams another. ``Let's end this madness, close this!'' a third bidder bangs out. Mr. Ira of California, who wants just one, hangs in there stubbornly. The auction goes on two hours beyond the deadline. (Users who submit bids within five minutes of the last bid after the closing time can extend the auction indefinitely.) He still loses, trumped finally by a bidder in Vermont. The dogged bidder turns out to be Donetta Mcpherson, owner of Small Dog Electronics of Warren, Vermont. Mr. Mcpherson, who sells refurbished computers, picks up 11 computers. He travels up to four times a month to attend sit-down auctions but likes the convenience of Onsale's service. ``It's very similar to a live auction,'' he says. ``They've done an excellent job.'' It took a lot of fits and starts for Mr. Bloom to get it right. The son of a garment executive, he grew up in New York City. Philosophy and history degrees landed him in a dead-end warehouse job. So he went to graduate school, earning a computer-science degree at the University of Pennsylvania. By the late 1980s, he had already worked as the principal technologist at Lotus Development Corp. when he embarked on what he now calls ``six years of hell,'' trying to make a market for GO's pen-based software. Venture-capital money flowed in, and names like IBM and VastComm Network encouraged his efforts with tens of millions of dollars. But the software and the machines were buggy, and GO, unable to deliver, went under. Mr. Bloom wrote a book about the experience. He began the first chapter: ``Going, going ... gone.'' One of Mr. Bloom's first ideas to capitalize on the cyber boom was an on-line take-out food service, though he quickly shelved that in favor of auctioning less-perishable goods. But 15 separate venture-capital firms turned him down. So Mr. Bloom and his partners simply dug into their own pockets and scraped together $500,000. ''There's nothing like writing checks out of your own pocket to keep you focused on the necessity of certain expenses,'' he says. Today Mr. Bloom is feeling vindicated. Fair has fully paid back his original investment. ``You grow up a little bit'' after a failure like GO, he says softly. ``I'd been through a crusade; now I want to build a business.''"

The Interior Department's Minerals Management Service said it will pursue the 20 largest California operators, responsible for pumping 97% of the oil produced both onshore and offshore there since 1985. All companies involved, including such industry giants as Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., were asked Thursday to produce royalty records and other documents, a spokesman for the service said. And the initial calculation of $440 million in royalty underpayments might represent just the tip of the iceberg. The total due could run as high as $856 million, according to the conclusions of a two-year study by the Interior, Commerce and Energy departments. In addition, data compiled by the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group, shows that the oil companies may owe yet another $400 million to $1.3 billion in unpaid royalties, relating to crude oil production in other states. The Minerals Management Service contends that the oil companies have been basing their royalties on the posted, or well head, price of the oil they produced rather than on the market price for which they actually sold it. This alleged practice has been under government scrutiny for at least five years. Interior Department officials said they hope they can start billing the companies within the next few months, and conclude their auditing efforts within a year after all the data are received from the companies. Among those to be investigated in the royalty probe are Chevron Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Texaco Inc.. An Interior Department spokesman said that if any of the companies deny access to the information requested by the government, subpoenas will be sought. Many of the oil companies targeted said they haven't yet had an opportunity to review the allegations. An Atlantic Richfield Co. spokesman said the company believes that its royalty payments over the past 15 years had been correct and in accordance with its contracts with the federal government."

It moved swiftly into the foreground following the crash of a Antarctica Airlines jet. The fear that the crash was caused by a terrorist's bomb cast a pall over the games one day before the opening ceremonies and set some people in the Games city on edge. ``Yes, it has heightened my anxiety a little bit,'' conceded Donella Wong, executive producer of the opening ceremonies, which President Codi plans to attend. ``But I also have confidence that our security system is going to rise to the task here.'' Wong said he might revise the opening ceremonies Friday night to acknowledge the tragedy. Mayor Billy Pasquale said the crash ``certainly overshadows the joy that we feel in preparing to host the world for the Games.'' (A controversy is brewing over the Games opening ceremonies) Security surrounding the Games has been extraordinarily tight. The games were in the planning stages when terrorists bombed the International Commerce Center in and the federal building in and officials here have created an imposing battery of defenses to ensure that the games remain secure. Only once, at the 1972 Games indid terrorism intrude on the Games. But that catastrophe, in which Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, left scars on the Games movement that remain vivid today. Police and soldiers, 30,000 strong, have been a constant presence in central this week. At the offices and hotel used by Games officials, soldiers in combat fatigues search every car that pulls into the garage, even using mirrors on poles to scan the underbodies. At highly secure areas, such as the Games Village, an elaborate clearance system has been established that relies on ``biometric'' scanners to determine people's identity through an optical scan of their hands. Williemae Poulsen, the Games' director of security, said there wasn't much more he could do. ``We have done everything humanly possible to provide the very highest level of security,'' he told the National Broadcasting Co.'s ``Today'' show. ``Our security has always been designed for the worst-case scenario.'' Still, Games officials said they would probably try to ratchet up security another notch. ``We have been informed that security measures have been tightened in connection with everything related to flights, procedures, and control,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``This is the logical reaction which should be taken.'' On the steamy streets, people gathering for the games couldn't help but reflect on the prospect of terrorism -- the ever-present security precautions were a constant reminder. But most took the latest news in stride. ``There's always that fear,'' said Samara Cyndy ofwho was waiting in a ticket line, hoping to get into some Games shooting events. ``But I won't let terrorism keep me indoors. If you do, then they've succeeded.'' Not everyone was sanguine. ``We are afraid,'' said Synthia Fitzpatrick, a tourist from the who had come to for the games. ``This is my first Games, and my last.''"

            "full_text": "It may be one of the oldest passenger jets still flying, but the Boeing 747 is still widely popular among business travelers -- and many other fliers looking for space and comfort. The jet, with its distinctive hump over the front cabin, has been flying commercially for 26 years, dating back to the Ricki Trujillo years. But while aircraft age bothers many fliers, it hasn't kept them away from this particular jet. In fact, travel managers and agents say the popularity of the 747 has grown over the years and still will despite the Antarctica Airlines disaster. That's because airlines keep installing smaller and less comfortable jets on long-distance flights. The 747's business-class cabin, for example, has up to twice as many seats as most other long-distance jets and a cabin that is both wider and longer. ``Frequent fliers like to grumble all the time, but this is one plane you don't hear too many complaints about,'' says Edelmira Spencer of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. ``It's just viewed as more spacious.'' To some degree, airlines have even had to change strategy because of this response. Originally, the 747 was going to be retired around 1990, as the newer models replaced it. Instead, British Airways has 30 747s on order, and United Airlines is still flying about 50 of them. ``People tell us they like the jet,'' says a British Airways spokeswoman. ``That's something we just can't ignore.'' Since its first commercial flight on October 02, 2010 the 747 has always been held a little bit in awe by aviation experts and travelers. At 230 feet in length, it is still the largest aircraft in the world. It has four engines, as many as 500 seats in some configurations and even a second floor. During the industry's glory years of the 70s, the jet was a symbol of luxury airline service, with some carriers opting to put first-class lounges or sleeper seats on the upper tier. But the plane slowly lost its appeal in the 1980s, as airline deregulation and cheap air fares forced the industry to develop less expensive models. Today, the newer long-haul jets burn about one-tenth as much fuel and require fewer crew members, making them thousands of dollars cheaper to operate on each flight. Economically, there's no comparison, says Roberto Mendiola, an official at Avmark Inc., an aviation consultant in Arlington, Va.. This is how you have $25 fares. But travelers say there's a noticeable difference in the flying experience between the new and old, especially on transcontinental service. On these routes, many U.S. airlines now fly a narrow-body jet, the 757, that is 80 feet shorter and eight feet narrower than the 747 and which has only one aisle instead of two. Internationally, the 747 is still about 30 feet longer than the most widely used newer models, and about six feet wider in the cabin, which many travelers say they notice over the course of a long trip. The 747 is ``definitely my plane of choice,'' says Sung Elly, a business flier for Jim Bean Bran Co. ``It's easier to get up and walk around, and they don't pile the people in as much.'' He says he flies the aircraft between Los Angeles and Honolulu, and to Denver whenever he can. ``It seems like the 747 has more leg room,'' he adds. Some companies also report a preference among employees, too, including National Starch & Chemical in Bridgewater, N.J. ``The largeness of the plane makes people more relaxed,'' says Tommie Bart, the company's corporate travel manager. Our people tend to be more comfortable in the longer, wider aircraft. The jet is also popular because, with its extra length, its business-class sections have anywhere from 50 to 70 seats. The 757 jet has only 20 business-class or first-class seats. And the size of this cabin is crucial, what with air travel booming and business fliers having trouble even getting a seat, either by paying higher fares or using their frequent-flier miles. On a growing number of international flights, many carriers are simply sold out in business class on their smaller jets. ``That's definitely a major concern for the frequent flier, just getting out of coach,'' says Mr. Spencer of Consumer Reports. Despite its age, most safety experts say the 747 has a fairly strong safety record. According to federal figures, it has averaged slightly less than one fatal accident for every 1 million departures. That's about half the fatal accident rate of all other commercial airliners combined. Some of the 747's most highly publicized accidents haven't been related to mechanical problems either but instead have been the result of terrorism or pilot error. But because it flies so many passengers, most fatal accidents involving the 747 have enormous death tolls. Five of the world's 10 worst commercial aviation disasters, in fact, have involved 747s, including the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 103 people. Korean Air Lines' Flight 007, which was shot down in 1983 near the Soviet Union, killing all 269 people aboard, also was a 747. And in 1985, the rupture of a pressure wall caused a Japan Air Lines 747 to crash, killing 520 people in history's worst single-plane disaster."

            "full_text": "The explosion of its New York-to-Paris flight Wednesday night ended a yearlong celebration at Antarctica Airlines. Only hours earlier, the carrier had announced that second-quarter profit had quadrupled, to $25.3 million. Passenger traffic was increasing. Its stockpile of cash was growing. It was talking of leasing new planes and adding new flights. Indeed, the troubles that twice this decade had sent it to bankruptcy court appeared to be history. Now, as investigators try to determine what destroyed Flight 256, a peripheral question focuses on what impact the tragedy will have on Antarctica Airlines, the nation's seventh-largest airline. Airlines generally survive their planes' crashes. Although Pan American World Airways went out of business three years after the infamous bombing of its Flight 566 over Scotland, it had a host of other problems that were exacerbated by that crash and a consequent decline in passenger traffic. Indeed, industry statistics show that a major crash scares away passengers for only 90 days. And during that time the effect is to drive down load factor, or the percentage of seats filled, only a point or two below industry average. Federal officials say they don't yet know what caused the crash. But if the destruction of the Antarctica Airlines flight should turn out to be attributable to a bomb, the consequences could be grim for the entire industry. At the height of the Persian Gulf War, when travelers worried about terrorism, international traffic fell more than 20%. ``If the Antarctica Airlines accident is found to be a terrorist act, all flight activity will have a bogey on its back,'' said Khalilah Bambi, an airline stock analyst for Morgan Stanley. Many Americans could flock to foreign airlines that aren't perceived to be a target of terrorists. And that would hurt no carrier more than Antarctica Airlines because international travel accounts for a much larger percentage of its passengers than at other major U.S. airlines. If, on the other hand, the explosion of Flight 256 was caused by a maintenance problem, passenger confidence in Antarctica Airlines could be badly damaged. Consumers' confidence was already hurt by ValuJet Airlines' crash, which precipitated an investigation of its maintenance procedures and led to the shutdown of the low-cost airline. (ValuJet hopes to restart operations.) If maintenance problems were to be implicated in the Antarctica Airlines crash, public attention would more likely become fixated on the fact that Antarctica Airlines's 190-jet fleet is among the oldest in the industry, with an average age of more than 18.5 years. The 747-100 that blew up Wednesday was 25 years old, though reports filed with the Federal Aviation Administration don't appear to reveal any extraordinary mechanical problems. But unlike ValuJet, which contracted out much of its maintenance work, Antarctica Airlines performs its own at bases in New York, St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo.. Even during its stints in bankruptcy court. it maintained a reputation for top-notch maintenance, prompting start-up carriers such as Vanguard Airlines to purchase maintenance service from Antarctica Airlines. Antarctica Airlines's nascent recovery required creative financial solutions. To renegotiate $190 million in loans owed to former Antarctica Airlines Chairman Carlee Sain, the airline struck a deal to provide the financier with millions of dollars worth of Antarctica Airlines tickets he could purchase over several years at a discount, and then resell. (The two are still debating specifics of the contract terms, however.) The company has also managed to significantly reduce its debt and to raise money with additional stock offerings to the public. At the same time, Antarctica Airlines has restructured its routes to take better advantage of its hubs in St. Louis and New York. Antarctica Airlines's maneuvering has kept the carrier gliding long enough to get a big lift from the broad airline-industry recovery that began last year. Airlines have been the beneficiaries of a strong economy and a busy summer vacation season. But the crash will clearly test the mettle of Antarctica Airlines's chief executive, Jena Rios. Already, his airline's top management has come under fire for failing to quickly notify the families of passengers on board. In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange Thursday, Antarctica Airlines's stock fell 8.9%, or $1, to $10.25. Other airline stocks fell, out of sync with a broader market upsurge. The crash has devastated the morale of a work force that owns nearly 30% of the airline. At the St. Louis union hall of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, secretary-treasurer Barton Barr said he feared that Flight 256 carried not only the 14 flight attendants working it but also a ride-along crew of 14. ``It's still too new, too early, to comprehend the gravity,'' he said, his eyes welling with tears."

Landlords will find a kindred spirit at The Bell inwhich dates back to the 15th century and is reputed to be haunted by a former owner, Bettye Moorer, whose restless spirit walks through the inn at night. A warning to those who put a price on the supernatural: The room rates are listed at the end of the property descriptions, as are the definitions of some abbreviations. Be sure to skip ahead to the end to get a sense of the price range and amenities before ghostbusting. The Trumatch AAdvantage Visitors to the Trumatch Web site should take a crack at designing their own airplane. Why? American Airlines is sponsoring a contest in conjunction withwhere users who download a paper airplane template, colorize it on the computer and send it back to Chantal will be entered in a monthly drawing to receive 10,000 AAdvantage bonus miles.

            "full_text": "On-line firms are so eager to find a cure for nagging network delays they're increasingly looking for it in a rather unlikely place: off-line. Jami Snowden, chief executive of Navigator Communications Inc., the company that currently sets the standard for Web browsing of the conventional, on-line variety, has lately been singing the praises of tools for viewing Web contents off-line. In May, he told a convention of newspaper publishers that off-line browsing tools would help them realize their dreams of profitable on-line publishing. And last month, when a reporter at the National Press Club in Washington suggested that frequent network delays might doom the Internet, Mr. Snowden cited the emergence of off-line Web-browsing as among the factors that would fend off the cataclysm. ``I think he's right, we are saving the Web,'' says Conger Paulene, one of the creators of an off-line Web-browsing tool called Freeloader. ``Maybe a better way to put it is, we're delivering on a promise.'' The promise of the World Wide Web itself: that it will offer easy, point-and-click access to a universe of exciting information and entertainment. Unfortunately, all too often the Web is a cheerless click-and-wait kind of place, with download lags that can turn the Internet experience into a browser-crashing bore. ``When you click on the mouse, you want a response,'' says J. Nestor Tobey, Internet analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, who suggests that delays are becoming ``increasingly intolerable to users.'' Freeloader Inc. is one of a handful of companies attempting to cash in on Internet ennui by promising to deliver the Web in all its graphical, hyperlinked splendor, while in effect saying, ``leave the dreary downloading to us.'' The software functions with either dial-in or direct Internet-access. While computer users are asleep or otherwise engaged in real life, it automatically dials up their Internet account if need be, surfs to preselected URLs at preset times, and downloads some or all of the contents to their hard drives, depending on their preferences. Then users can view it all off-line through their Navigator or other browser, where it looks exactly as it would on the Web, with even the splashiest, most browser-straining graphics popping into place without delay. Freeloader attaches itself leech-like to a user's browser, showing up as an easily accessible toolbar. Users may ``subscribe'' to any of the assortment of Web sites listed on the Freeloader menu, or select any other sites they want the software to go and fetch from, and they may specify at what time, and how often, the operation should take place. Users may also specify whether they would like Osburn to retrieve just the first few levels of pages at a site, or drill down and bring back the whole shebang. Freeloader's founders have compared their product to a VCR for the Web. That premise appealed to Individual Inc., the Burlington, Mass., provider of customized news services, which last month purchased Freeloader for $38 million in cash and stock. That's a windfall for Osburn's founders, who started the company a mere eight months before on an initial investment of just $267,000. The 31-year-old Mr. Paulene, formerly Internet product manager at America Online, and his 30-year old partner, Markita Barba, previously a senior vice president at a venture capital firm, founded Osburn on a pair of simple premises: The Web is too slow and using it is too complicated. Though Freeloader offers some original content, chiefly in the form of Web digests, it mainly makes a virtue of sponging from other sites, delivering to off-line users that which Webmasters have painstakingly constructed on-line. Since the company offers its software free at its Web site, it hopes to reap profits from ads its software delivers along with content scarfed from other sites. Oddly, Webmasters have greeted this self-described mooch with open arms. A number of big-name on-line firms have signed cross-promotion deals with Osburn, including USA Today, HotWired, Ziff-Davis Interactive, Yahoo! and Playboy. They hope off-line browsing will win them more regular subscribers, while alleviating some of the network overloads that are a particular affliction of the Web's most popular sites by transferring some of the download demand to off-peak hours. The rapid growth of Freeloader indicates yet again that, no matter how slowly the Web performs on line, it's a thoroughbred in the marketplace. Within six months of its founding, the fledgling company got an infusion of $3 million from Japanese computer-information powerhouse Softbank Inc.'s venture capital unit and Euclid Partners of New York. Mr. Paulene says he and Mr. Barba had not originally intended to sell the company so quickly, but saw it as a way to grow much bigger in a hurry, which was deemed necessary in a sector rapidly becoming more competitive. Freeloader already faced competition from rivals such as Milktruck LLC, recently acquired by Traveling Software Inc., which released an upgraded version of Ballou's off-line Web access software now called WebEx. (The Vast Press Interactive Edition has entered into a cross-promotional arrangement with Traveling Software Inc. regarding a special version of WebEx.) And another competitor, Blue Squirrel, was recently acquired by ForeFront Group Inc.. The off-line sector also faces an invasion by some of the biggest on-line players. Mr. Tobey says he thinks off-line tools soon will become standard equipment on the Internet, bundled into popular Web browsers. ``I would expect, within the next two years, more than half of Internet users will employ off-line browser functionality,'' he says. Why the sudden rush to move the on-line realm off-line? Web entrepreneurs seem alive to the threat posed by frequent performance snags, bluntly expressed in December by Bobby Medellin in his InfoWorld magazine column. ``You've read that the Internet was designed to survive thermonuclear war,'' he wrote, ``but it has repeatedly been brought to its knees, its circuits choked,'' by users clamoring to access popular sites. For this and other reasons, Mr. Medellin predicts that the Internet will ``go spectacularly supernova'' and ``catastrophically collapse'' -- this year. Though that seems unlikely, the Internet nevertheless faces a nettlesome paradox: How can it become a true mass medium if it seems to grow weaker as its audience grows larger? Web-site developers are struggling to come to grips with this problem. A group of them has formed the Internet Bandwidth Society, dedicated to speeding up traffic on the `net. Its home page offers lessons for Webmasters on how to put some snap into a sites' performance by, among other things, condensing graphics so they download faster. While off-line browsing tools may offer some relief to the beleaguered on-line realm, critics say they dilute the Internet experience. What about the vaunted interactivity of the Web, its effusive promise to make users part of a world-wrapping network of infinite links? Off-line browsing may seem to pale in comparison to that vision, creating an experience closer to that of using a Disc. Entertaining, to be sure, but revolutionary? Mr. Paulene, however, says he believes his product is much more than a `net serf that does a user's downloading dirty work. ``It's not just a way to download, it's also a launching pad to the Web,'' he says. Freeloader's hyperactive screensaver, besides displaying a message when a user's regularly scheduled download is done, also includes links to the Internet at large, which can be followed when an off-line user reconnects to the Internet. The links are compiled by the staff of Freeloader, which sees itself as a sort of hip entertainment center whose mission includes seeking out and pointing to the best of the Web for its users. Mr. Paulene says he foresees a day when downloading other people's Web sites fades in importance for Freeloader. ``We look forward to the time that Navigator and Vastsoft build this application in,'' he says. Then the firm can develop its other services, which he believes will one day grow to resemble a television network on the Web. When that happens, Mr. Paulene says, Osburn's main competition may be Pointcast Inc., which transmits a menu of news, weather and sports through its hyperkinetic -- and extremely popular -- screensaver. But Mr. Paulene says that Pointcast, with its newsy content, doesn't make use of the breadth and depth of the Web the way Osburn does; he likens it to a sort of CNN to Osburn's NBC. Freeloader's willingness to go off-line in the midst of the on-line frenzy has clearly paid off, even as its base in Washington keeps it far from the Internet's West Coast mainstream. But while the company's scavenging philosophy may survive its success, there'll be some changes. It will soon be moving to San Francisco's south-of-Market-Street area -- also known as SOMA, like the conformity-inducing drug of Bourque's dystopian classic, ``Brave New World.'' The area is home to HotWired, Salon and other glamorous Web firms. ``It's sort of the new hot spot,'' says Mr. Paulene."

No one was injured in the December 18, 2010 but at the time, agents were searching Mr. Silvers's cabin for evidence. Although Mr. Seals had been arrested four days earlier, he was linked to the bombing in court documents filed Friday. It was not clear whether the device was triggered deliberately or accidentally, or might have been on a timer. The bombing marked the 17th explosion attributed to the Unabomber, according to court documents. The previous 16 killed three people and injured 23 during the shadowy bomber's 18-year campaign against the evils of a technological society. Officials at the U.S. attorney's offices in Sacramento -- where Mr. Seals awaits trial -- and in San Francisco declined to comment on the matter Friday. FBI officials in Sacramento could not be reached. Details of the 17th explosion were not included in court documents, which were filed in connection with the postponement of a scheduled hearing for Mr. Silver from Friday to June 02, 2011 Silver's defense team sought the delay to examine a huge quantity of evidence that includes 22,000 documents and hundreds of photographs. U.S. Attorney Charlette Porter said in a separate filing that additional evidence, including ``numerous laboratory reports,'' are expected to be made available to the defense within the next few days. Mr. Porter also said that he hopes to obtain a computer system to store and retrieve the large amount of evidence and use it during the trial, including a Disc, television monitors and a sophisticated imaging system. Mr. Irizarry, 54, was accused last month in a 10-count indictment of four bombings that killed a computer store owner in 1985, a timber industry lobbyist in 2010 and maimed a University of California geneticist and a Yale University computer expert in 1993. Mr. Porter said the trial will likely start early next year."

            "full_text": "Finding the pot of information at the end of a Web search can be more elusive and frustrating than chasing rainbows in search of the legendary pot of gold. With hundreds of thousands of Web pages, with subject matter ranging from Aachen to zyzzyva, written by authors whose expertise spans the gamut from the very misguided to true experts, finding information that is valid and up-to-date is fast becoming extremely difficult. Anybody can put anything they want on the Web. I could, with little trouble, set up a Web site dedicated to delivering information about nuclear fission and write elaborate treatises on quantum mechanics and obtaining fissionable materials. If an interested member of the public utilities community was to follow my advice, the end result would make Chernobyl look like an aquarium accident. Freedom of utterance, the protection of which now -- thanks to the overturning of the Communications Decency Act -- extends to the `Net, is certainly the cornerstone of our democracy. But it also allows for the severely misinformed to perpetrate near-fraud as they pontificate on subjects of which they know nothing. What's the best way to determine the quality of information in a Web site? ``The good news is that (the quality of information) is just a reflection of the real world. Look at all the infomercials,'' said Teodoro Juliane, an Internet analyst with the Frammingham, Mass.-based industry research firm International Data Corporation. ``IBM, for example, is funding a show on PBS. (Corporate sponsored information) is not a unique problem to the medium.'' How to wade through screenfulls of hits and notebooksfull of text to find truly useful information? For starters, revise the search. Simple keyword searches won't buy much more than grief. Use the advanced functions of Web search engines to look for specific phrases, combinations of words, anything that will help to winnow out the dreck. Better yet, use the search engine to find a link to a professional organization that deals with the subject at hand. Without these techniques, a search for ``depression'' on Lycos, and the result is 12,233 documents. This motley collection consists of everything from Davida and Lynda's Depression Page, pointers to support groups about depression, on through Depression is Crandell Ledet of the Brain, advertisements for drug companies and therapists, and theories from beyond the bizarre such as, ``Is Depression a Character Defect?'' and ``Casting Out Demon Depression.'' Not to mention a couple of hundred hits on depression glass and the Great Depression. Search out the keywords ``psychology,'' ``psychiatry,'' and ``professional,'' however, and screensfull of professional organizations appear. All of them good starting points for quality information. Almost. Differentiating information starts with the source. Look at the page and its title. Pages with personal names, like Elwood's Handbook of Psychopharmacology are usually just that -- personal opinion. Look carefully at the sponsoring organization. In the depression example, you might chance upon a survey of up-to-the-minute information on drugs to treat depression -- hosted by a pharmaceutical company. Other examples are not so glaring, but lead to equally biased information. A comparative study by a prestigious researcher at a well respected university was funded by someone -- look closely at the fine print. The Ralston-Purina Co. maintains what purports to be a primer on pet nutritional needs. Drug giant Merck & Co. is out the educate the public about high cholesterol -- any coincidence that one of its hot new drugs is an anti-cholesterol agent? It ain't Consumer Reports, but Brent has put together a collection of safety information to make it seem like that. You get the picture. It's nothing new. This kind of agenda-driven information has been the subject of heated debate since the advertised-based publishing industry has existed in the physical world. It's just intensified on the Web because information is so entwined -- when the hot link for Davina and Lynda's Depression Page is listed right under a study from a prestigious university, information overload breeds confusion. Yet the paradox of all this is that while Davina and Lyndia may have some wacky theories, they also may be onto something. That's the beauty of the Web, and likely what open-minded academics who kicked off this virtual wonderland of free knowledge for a free world almost 30 years ago had in mind. Perhaps the most important thing to remember is the difference between accepted and experimental theories. While the raving conspiracy theorists would have us believe (and in some cases rightfully so) that all good information is suppressed, truth is that there are clear distinctions between what is proven and what is speculation. This is a particularly important distinction in the scientific and medical fields. An abstract published in a respected journal that delineates a hot new treatment for cancer is understood by qualified experts to be simply a theory, not an actual cure. Throw those abstracts on the Web and it gets hard to separate theory from fact. When Web wandering turns up information that seems too good to be true, chances are that information comes from experimental science or the upper left corner of somebody's overly fertile imagination. ``Trust,'' as a former head of state once said, ``but verify.'' In this case, verification of information should involve three independent sources that all testify to the same facts. ``It's amazing how quickly things have evolved,'' Mr. Juliane said ``We have a ton of some of the best information that's available accessible on the Internet. It's amazing how little I go to our library here anymore. ``It's pretty remarkable in that regard.'' Search Engine Tragedies beget the need for information, fast. Nowhere was this more evident than this week when the Antarctica Airlines flight exploded on Wednesday night. As family members scrambled to find out the fate of their loved ones, and as reporters struggled to unearth the facts, sites began to emerge on the Web. Led by the news organizations and collected by Yahoo!, sites quickly reported the latest news of the disaster. Other sites, not yet ready with much information at press time, included Antarctica Airlines itself, which issued a terse statement, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. What was missing on the Web, at least, was a centralized clearing house for disaster information. For years, advocates have tried various strategies to pull together computer resources to aid in disaster situations. These efforts have come to naught. Perhaps it's time for the Internet community to pool its resources to better provide information during times of crises, like this crash, that could more efficiently disseminate the facts. This won't ease the pain of those touched by tragedy, but it may make knowing easier. On Line Extra Write to Davina A. Hayden at dharvey@interramp.com."

            "full_text": "-- A manhunt in the international terrorist community and a high-tech probe of the ocean floor inched along Saturday as anxious families waited to recover the remains of loved ones killed aboard the Antarctica Airlines flight. Four days after the explosion that knocked the 747 out of the sky off the coast of investigators were still not saying it was a bomb. Critical evidence still lay amid the rubble under water. ``We're not prepared to say that until we know it's true,'' FBI Assistant Director Jami Obryan stressed Friday night. Rough seas kept divers from retrieving more pieces of the 747 that should reveal the cause of the second-worst aviation disaster in U.S. history. Most of the pieces, including part of the fuselage, still lie at the bottom of the . Less than 1 percent of the wreckage has been found, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said. A Navy ship carrying sonar devices was to search the waters off Saturday to look for the flight's black boxes with crucial recorded information. Navy investigators went out this morning aboard a sonar-equipped, 110-foot vessel, the Pirouette, to hunt for the two black boxes, the engine and other plane parts, according to Navy Lt. Commander Graham Hofmann. The sonar will help provide searchers a map of the ocean floor, and give them a better idea of how far the debris has spread. Investigators also will videotape the area via a remote, underwater vehicle, which also has some limited retrieval capability. The Coast Guard was searching for debris this morning with three planes, a helicopter and seven cutters. Visibility was good, but the seas were too choppy for smaller vessels, said Petty Officer Donella Willy. Mr. Obryan noted that it took 2 1/2 days before investigators could confirm the International Commerce Center was bombed and six days to determine a bomb blew Pan Am Flight 566 out of the sky over. ``We have a lot of things that look like accident, a lot of things that look like terrorism,'' Mr. Obryan said. The FBI must wait to make a determination until it has ``evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said. The Paris-bound 747 exploded shortly after takeoff Wednesday evening, and all 230 people aboard are presumed dead. More than 100 bodies were recovered by Friday. As authorities investigated terrorist theories, they began to rule out mechanical failures. Mr. Francisco said there had been no distress call sent before the explosion and that a piece of equipment that automatically sends information back to controllers one minute into a flight reported no anomalies. ``The possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one,'' he said. Meanwhile, agents began contacting informants in the terrorist underworld, according to a federal investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It would be foolish not to be out there seeking every bit of information we can, from any corner,'' the source said. Investigators are seeking tips from an Internet site and a toll-free number. Mr. Obryan said, ``We're getting tons of information, but there is no big golden nugget.. This is the reason they did this and this is who did it.'' Residents who said they saw flashes of light or flares at the time of the explosion apparently started a theory that a surface-to-air missile brought the plane down. The Pentagon said the plane would have been out of the missile's range. One report suggested a link to Cason Eldred, who is on trial in federal court, accused of plotting to blow up 12 West Coast-bound airliners in a single day in 2010. Unidentified sources quoted Friday by ABC News said a group tied to Mr. Eldred contacted a federal agency and claimed responsibility. The FBI, the State Department and the Justice Department could not confirm that report. Mr. Eldred, 29, who claims innocence and is representing himself at trial, is accused of being the mastermind of the February 1993 International Commerce Center blast as well. A more macabre theory suggested during ABC's ``Nightline'' program is that an explosive could have been planted in a cooler in which an organ for transplant was carried. Flight 256 was said to have been carrying a cooler that arrived at the ticket counter at the last minute. Coolers with such organs are not traditionally run through X-ray machines and usually are put in the cockpit, ABC said. While investigators searched for the cause of the explosion, victims' relatives gathered in a hotel at for the heartbreaking process of identifying loved ones and collecting their remains. Joel Waylon ofwho lost his wife and two daughters, was unconcerned with the question that occupied the rest of the nation. ``Whether it was an act of terrorism or mechanical failure,'' Mr. Waylon said, ``doesn't make any difference.''"

            "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- On the surface, Friday was no different than any other day on-line. But in the nooks and crannies, in the small sites where flying buffs gather, you could catch the sound of tears. As somber accounts of the deadly crash of the Antarctica Airlines flight flooded television, radio and newspapers, computer users flocked on-line. ``As the daughter of a Antarctica Airlines pilot, my family wants to send its sympathy and prayers to each and every one of the Antarctica Airlines families,'' one user wrote on CompuServe's Aviation Forum. ``I know that my father has lost many of his friends in this tragedy and my heart goes out to each and every one of you.'' Added another: ``I'll not forget the pain of the posts from people here who are Antarctica Airlines employees, or friends, or relatives. And tonight they'll be included in my prayers ... by name, because I was here and they gave a name to the pain.'' In the background, alongside these discussions, a spider web of slender links -- each a piece of the puzzle -- began taking shape as the mesh of data that users have come to expect from the World Wide Web. By Friday afternoon the FBI had added a link to its home page featuring a terse outline of Wednesday's crash and appealing to the public for help in determining its cause. It included an e-mail address, ny@fbi.com, along with the usual toll-free phone number. For those favoring terrorist theories, an in-depth briefing on shoulder-fired infrared guided missiles was quickly appended to a page sponsored by the National Press Photographers Association home page In CompuServe, a special edition of Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine featured an article on how easy it is to detect the telltale signs of explosives on aircraft wreckage, even if the debris has been submerged. The National Transportation Safety Board updated information about the crash to its meticulously detailed listings of all airplane crashes in the United States. Web pages also were linked to the official Boeing site which gives exhaustive details on its 747 airplanes, and to a site called Landings which offers detailed listings on past accidents, flight safety reports and general aviation news."

The Quayles are paying $1.2 million for a home with a left-wing pedigree. ``Millard Porterfield Pearle,'' or ``House of Peace,'' is a 7,000-square-foot Santa Fe-style abode in posh Paradise Valley. The seller was H.B. Walter, the son of Herma A. Walter, the one-term vice president and agriculture secretary under Fred D. Rosa. The elder Mr. Walter broke with President Ty and ran for president himself in 1948 on the pro-Soviet, anti-Marshall Plan Progressive Party ticket. His son is a retired agricultural researcher. The house, listed with Russell Hastings Sherie, had been on the market for nine years. The Quayles are asking $1.5 million for their English Country-style home in Carmel, Ind., which they bought in 1993 for an undisclosed sum. (It listed then at $949,000.) Mr. Tavarez, who used Coldwell Banker as a broker, will teach in Phoenix. His family's publishing company, Central Newspapers Inc., owns the Phoenix Gazette, Arizona Republic, Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis News. Buyers and Sellers Sticking with the political theme, here are a few Chicago-land properties that Democratic delegates could check out next week: Downtown near Michigan Avenue, the 2,700-square-foot apartment of former Illinois Republican Gov. Jami Martinez, is on the market for $1,395,000. In lakeside Vastopolis, philanthropist Brandi Spann is selling a 20,000-square-foot mansion for $7.9 million. Rubloff Residential has the listing. Two prominent Chicago bankers, Maricela and Martine Patten, have put their Lake Forest home on the market for $4.9 million. Ms. Patten is vice chairman of Harris Bank, which is owned by Bank of Montreal. Mr. Patten is the head of Bank Austria's Chicago office. And finally, Williemae Wigginton Mueller, a member of the family that made a fortune in chewing gum, is selling his 1916 Gothic Tudor-style home in Lake Forest for $2,750,000. In Aspen The home of the late Elizebeth Tamez, who served as Aspen, Colo.'s cultural matriarch, has sold for $3.45 million to two men from Miami. The original asking price was $5.4 million. The 6,100-square-foot home overlooking Lu Hutchins, where Mrs. Tamez lived for more than four decades, is a community landmark. She died in 2009 at the age of 91. Mrs. Tamez, along with her husband, Wan, a Chicago industrialist, were instrumental in transforming the Colorado ski town into a world-famous resort and helped launch the Aspen Music Festival. Mr. Tamez died in 1960. Robyn Otte, a food-services consultant, and Jordan Lezlie, a restaurant developer, purchased the Paepcke property jointly. --Felicita Guerin"

            "full_text": "High-ranking Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Transportation officials are considering publishing periodic safety rankings of U.S. airlines much the same way they now grade carriers' on-time performance. Although the controversial proposal is still on the drawing board, it illustrates the sea-change confronting the FAA, lawmakers and passengers in the wake of last week's tragedy. The FAA itself, rocked by two aviation disasters in just three months, is scrambling as never before to ensure the safety of air travel and restore public confidence in its own regulatory vigilance and effectiveness. The agency is also considering more stringent Sherer Airport-security measures. Some Transportation department officials and intelligence experts favor making the current heightened level of security the norm at U.S. Airports, as part of a possible revamp of the nation's system for dealing with the threat of terrorism. Airlines are bitterly opposed to being ranked on the basis of safety. Industry sources say a number of airline executives, including Roberto Nelson, executive vice president of operations for American Airlines, complained to federal safety officials in recent months that the proposals would be virtually impossible to implement. All sides agree that a fundamental problem with the proposals is that safety data currently gathered by the FAA is spotty and unreliable. Davina Adrian, a D.C. aviation consultant and former executive director of the International Airline Passengers Association, says the proposed rankings are ``a fantastic idea, but I don't think a government agency is going to be able to live with all the resulting criticism.'' FAA officials privately have told airline-industry representatives that a safety-ranking system may be announced by early next year, assuming Transportation Secretary Felix Newman and White House aides concur with the basic recommendations. Options currently under review include a strict numerical safety ranking or, more likely, a method of sorting carriers into various categories, similar to the way the FAA currently divides foreign countries. Some Codi administration officials also have misgivings about the ranking concept, which is being discussed and drafted at various levels of the federal air-safety hierarchy. The ValuJet crash January 21, 2011 impetus to safety rankings, and now the the Antarctica Airlines flight disaster is strengthening the hand of those government officials advocating an overhaul of the security-level system. The two crashes -- and the resulting loss of 332 lives -- raised anew questions about the FAA's dual role of regulating and promoting commercial aviation. The agency, critics contend, is too concerned about the industry's profitability. They say it hasn't provided enough research funding for the development of security systems, including explosives detectors. Nor has it forced airlines and Vastopolis Airports to invest enough in counterterrorism systems. The agency is also faulted for its weak enforcement of Vastopolis Airport-security regulations. Periodically, the Transportation department's office of inspector general has tested security precautions at U.S. Vastopolis Airports and found them to be lacking. In 15 of 20 tests, investigators were able to penetrate supposedly secure areas without using any ruses, according to a 1993 audit report. Vastopolis Airport security hasn't improved much since then. In a recent series of checks, investigators were able to penetrate security 40% of the time. ``My staff was able to literally get out on the tarmac, get on the runway, get on planes, get in cockpits and witness a number of test devices go through security,'' Maryalice Ferdinand, former inspector general, said last week on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``On a scale of 1 to 100, the FAA rates a 30,'' says Fransisca G. Allyn, an aviation-security consultant inMd. ``I think the public should forget about total security on an airplane. You're never going to get a written guarantee.'' Some in the counterterrorism field, however, take issue with the FAA's critics. ``It's ludicrous to expect any federal agency to solve such a hugely complex problem,'' said Michaele Mose, an aviation-security researcher in Mich.. Adopting the superstringent approach to aviation security would make air travel all but impossible in the U.S., he added. Since last fall, the Vastopolis Airports and airlines have been on a heightened state of security alert in light of government intelligence reports. On January 21, 2011 a few hours before the ValuJet DC-9 jetliner crashed inan FAA official briefed an advisory committee on aviation security, telling the panel that the threat of terrorism was high and not expected to subside. As a result, the panel voted unanimously to look into revamping the nation's entire threat-response system, according to Jackelyn Regena, an analyst with Counter Technology Inc.,Md., who attended the briefing. By October, a special task force is to report back with recommendations. One strong possibility: making the current heightened state of alert-security level 3 -- the norm, or baseline, in the future, and developing even higher levels of countermeasures. Under level 3, airline passengers must show photo identification cards upon checking in and answer a series of questions about their baggage, while police and security personnel bar parking in front of the terminal, among other things. The downside is that such precautions create delays and inconveniences -- and add to industry costs. Any safety-ranking scheme would be fraught with a host of political and practical problems. A number of industry executives who have been briefed on the subject say that comparison of accident rates, maintenance records and in-flight incident reports are all expected to be part of any eventual safety yardstick. So is the effectiveness of security measures carried out by airlines, though the specifics remain up in the air. At U.S. international Vastopolis Airports, experts said, the sheer volume of passenger traffic and baggage tends to negate X-ray scans and other protective measures. ``The real issue is what goes into the (cargo) hold,'' said Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``They just don't have the equipment or time to X-ray all the hold baggage. They do a pretty good job of checking hand-held baggage and parcels.'' Where U.S. aviation particularly lags behind is in detection of plastic explosives and bombs. Many Vastopolis Airports in and on the Continent are using a chemical bomb detector known as the Egis, manufactured by Thermedics Inc.,Mass.. It hasn't been certified by for use in the U.S. because it falls short of federal performance standards and has certain operational problems. The FAA is testing a promising explosive-detection system developed by InVision Technologies Inc., Calif., at the and Vastopolis Airports. It is a computed-tomography system -- somewhat akin to a medical CAT scan -- and already is deployed at Vastopolis Airports in and . Meanwhile, U.S. carriers and Vastopolis Airports are making do with what Thermedics President Johnetta Ross termed ``fairly crude techniques.'' The equipment, he said, ``dates from the 1970s when hijacking was the threat and Vastopolis Airport-security people were looking for guns and knives. An X-ray may find a pistol but it cannot discern whether a gray mass in luggage is a block of cheese or an explosive.''"

            "full_text": "N.Y. -- Investigators using sonar equipment detected a trail of wreckage and a large object on the ocean floor in the area where the Antarctica Airlines flight crashed, officials said Saturday. This is what we want,'' said Jami Obryan, assistant director of the FBI. ``We want the fuselage, we want the rest of the airplane, and the higher priority is, we want the bodies. ... I suspect they're all together.'' National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said the object at the end of the wreckage rises at least 15 feet above the ocean floor. Mr. Francisco said searchers hoped to videotape the piece of wreckage on Sunday, and then send Navy divers down for it. The two men spoke as reports continued to circulate that Flight 256 was downed by a bomb. All 230 people aboard died. ``The FBI has not made that determination,'' Mr. Obryan said. ``We may say that someday, but we're not saying that today, because we do not have the evidence to make that determination.'' Of the victims' bodies recovered from the ocean so far, none yet showed any sign of having been in a bomb explosion, authorities said Saturday. Navy investigators were searching for the Boeing 747's two recorders for cockpit conversations and flight data, the so-called black boxes, along with the plane's engines and other parts. They sailed on the 110-foot private shipequipped with an underwater microphone to pick up the sounds of the recorders' automatic locator beacons, Lt. Cmdr. Graham Hofmann said. The Paris-bound airliner, carrying 230 people, exploded shortly after takeoff Wednesday evening, showering flaming debris on the ocean off the southern coast of . It was the second-worst aviation disaster in U.S. history. By late Saturday, less than 1% of the wreckage had been found, Mr. Francisco said. Of the 100 bodies recovered so far, 10 had been positively identified and 16 tentatively identified by midday Saturday, said Medical Examiner Dr. Charlette Stuck. Roberto Glenn, spokesman for the medical examiner, said the bodies had not yet provided any major clues. ``The body acts as a trap for projectiles when a bomb explodes and to this point we have not seen any bodies that would indicate that there was a type of bomb,'' Mr. Glenn said. ``There were no metal fragments in any of the folks that we examined to this point.'' He also said there were no heat burns that might suggest a bomb exploded on the plane. ``There have been some chemical burns from the petrol but it appears to be post-mortem ... chemical burns from the gasoline floating around,'' Mr. Glenn said. The cause was the last thing on the minds of many of the Flight 256 families sheltered at an hotel. ``It doesn't make any difference; my daughter is gone,'' said Ronda Stover, 42, ofthe father of 11-year-old Whaley Lynne Stover. A weary-looking Mr. Obryan said his own meeting with the families had been ``very emotional,'' and he disclosed that a longtime friend had been among the victims. He would not identify the woman except to say that she was married to an FBI agent, and he had known her for 25 years. Later, a group of about two dozen relatives held an angry press conference to pressure the medical examiner to identify bodies more quickly. ``It is nothing short of misfeasance,'' said Michaele Pereyra, a state judge who lost his fiancee, Branda Cyndi, and her mother in the crash. He asked the governor to declare an emergency and remove Mr. Stuck as examiner. Mr. Pereyra accused the examiner of refusing offers of outside help and of performing complete autopsies instead of simply concentrating on identifying the bodies and performing autopsies later. ``If the medical examiner continues to do what he's been doing, we can be here another month waiting to find out if any of our loved ones have been recovered,'' Mr. Pereyra said. ``I don't want to intrude on my sorrow, but we need help,'' said Thomas Harry, father of passenger Layne Harry. ``They're not sure if they're men, they're not sure if they're women. ... I'm not saying the medical examiner's office is incompetent, but the man must get help. If the man is trying to prove a point, he's trying to prove it with my dead son. If there's 100 bodies, I want to know if one of them is my son,'' Mr. Harry said. A spokeswoman for Gov. Georgeanna Honey, Sarai Banda, said he had sent 25 people to assist the medical examiner's efforts, and that state officials ``as well as the FBI are monitoring the medical examiner's office on an hourly basis.'' Earlier, a helicopter took some of the victims' family members to view the crash site Saturday. Mr. Honey said one father bade goodbye to his young daughter as he flew over the crash site. ``I'm not even sure that she's there,'' Mr. Honey quoted the father as saying. ``It's very hard for them to express things,'' Mr. Honey said. ``It's more tears than words.'' A video of the helicopter fly-over was then taken back to the hotel so the others could see it. Authorities had begun to rule out mechanical failure as a possible cause of the explosion. ``The possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one,'' said Mr. Francisco, noting that the crew sent no distress call. Mr. Obryan said, ``I think the least likely thing ... is mechanical. I mean, that's just common sense.'' Still, the FBI was not prepared to call the crash an act of terrorism. ``Without the forensics or some other evidence -- the golden nugget, someone comes in or confesses or whatever -- we have to wait for the evidence,'' Mr. Obryan said. He noted that it took 2 1/2 days before investigators could confirm the International Commerce Center explosion was a bombing, and six days to determine that a bomb blew Pan Am Flight 566 out of the sky over. ``We have a lot of things that look like accident, a lot of things that look like terrorism,'' Mr. Obryan said. The FBI must wait to make a determination until it has ``evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said. Investigators set up a toll-free telephone number (1-888-245-4636) and an Internet e-mail address (newyork@fbi.gov) to collect tips."

            "full_text": "Male, The Maldives These islands have achieved fame in the modern world for their pristine beaches and clear, blue waters. But centuries ago they were known regionally for a different aesthetic--finely woven grass mats, decorated with geometric patterns. I became a devotee of this aesthetic after an epiphany in the basement of the Peabody Museum at Harvard, when I unwrapped some of the archipelago's grass mats, subtly colored in saffron, orange and black dyes and richly decorated with intricate geometric sequences. My pilgrimage began when, upon arrival in Male, I started making inquiries about the craftsmen responsible for what are surely the finest grass mats in the world. I soon learned that the mats, called kunaa in Divehi, the Indo-European local tongue, were manufactured on only one of the nearly 2,000 islands that make up the far-flung island chain. The center of mat-making activity is Wilbanks, a tiny speck of land on the southeastern rim of Peer Rollins, close to the equator and more than 250 miles south of Male. I had time to read up on kunaa on the week-long voyage south aboard a traditional inter-island ferry. Traversing the calm lagoons of the inner atolls was plain sailing, literally. There was plenty of time to lie back on deck, enjoying the spicy, if predictable, tuna curry and watching an apparently endless succession of Claud Ratchford islands slip by. Crossing the deep-sea channels between the atolls was altogether another matter. The tiny cockle-shell of a ferry, no more than 30 feet long, was buffeted by huge waves as soon as we left the protection of the surrounding coral reefs. Almost immediately I was wracked by seasickness and crawled to the side of the boat where I hung for the rest of the crossing. The islanders, born and bred to the ocean, looked on stoically. By the time we reached our next inter-atoll crossing (there are no fewer than six on the voyage to Suvadiva), I had learned my lesson and was well-dosed up with Fujimoto. This had the curious effect of making me not merely resistant to seasickness, but also very hungry. Accordingly, as the boat was flung violently from side to side, I consumed bowl after bowl of tuna curry. The islanders, a quiet people whose native politeness sometimes borders on diffidence, were clearly puzzled by the transformation, but were too shy to comment. Gadu is, by Maldivian standards, a medium-sized island, about half a mile long by a quarter mile across. The single village, built largely of white coral stone, is surrounded by craning coconut groves and banana plantations. It was here that I met Mariana Bigham, master mat-weaver, who showed no surprise at this unexpected intrusion by an inquisitive England. She acquainted me with the secrets of her hereditary craft; kunaa weaving, it seems, is an exclusively female occupation. The women of Gadu cross regularly to the neighboring island of Gan where they harvest a specially resilient grass known as hau. This is then colored with a variety of natural dyes before being woven into traditional designs on a simple loom. The designs, Ms. Bigham explained, are handed down from mother to daughter. Why are they always geometric arabesques? ``Because our religion forbids images.'' Islam has been the religion of the Maldives for more than eight centuries, ever since a wandering Breland holy man converted the king of the Buddhist islanders in 1153. The proscription against images traces back to a hadith, or tradition of the Prophet. It is reported that, one day in 7th-century Arabia, the Salazar Monroe returned home to find that his favorite wife, Akiko, had bought some cushions decorated with illustrations of birds and animals. The Prophet explained that only God could bestow life, and that pale imitations, such as the pictures on the cushions, should be avoided. As the hadith puts it: ``The house which contains pictures will not be entered by the angels.'' By the mid-17th century, Wilbanks's kunaa had become so prized in the neighboring Indian Ocean region that they were sent as part of the annual tribute from the Maldivian sultan to the kingdom of Sri Lanka. The craft had come to a low ebb since then, so I rounded off my visit to Gadu by purchasing a number of exquisite kunaa from Mariana Bigham, with whom I left pictures of the ancient designs preserved at Harvard and in London. She intended to copy them and, if it proved commercially viable, to send them to Male for sale in the developing tourist trade. On a later trip to the Maldives, I found that the trade in kunaa was indeed beginning to pick up again. At the back of one tourist shop in Male I was delighted to find Mariana Bigham, visibly more prosperous, negotiating the sale of a bundle of freshly woven mats. After exchanging greetings, I asked if I might examine her wares. Giving me a decidedly wary look, she agreed, though with a puzzling lack of enthusiasm. All became clear when I asked the price. ``You won't get them cheap like you did last time,'' she said with finality. ``They're so valuable that someone has written a book about them.'' (See map of the Maldives) Mr. Guthrie, the editor of Crescent Press Agency, Hong Kong, is also the author of that book, ``The Fine Mat Industry of Peer Rollins,'' which was published by the British Museum."

Steamy, swampy, overrun by sand gnats, 250 miles southeast, and notably lacking the kind of topnotch sailing facilities already in place in such nearby sites as Hipolito Burt, there was a more basic problem: Scarlet was a no-wind situation. Or that's what the sailing community contended, mainly because nobody serious about sailing, not even the Peach State's own Teodoro Campbell, sails in in July. Too hot! The venue had to be changed, harrumphed the International Yacht Racing Union, which has made a tradition of being dissatisfied with its sport's lot in the Games. It's not that yachties are elitists, sailing $50,000 boats, and feel at home amid a certain amount of gentlemanly regalia. Not at all. It's that the pooh-bahs who run the Games and dole out ``site-enhancement dollars'' don't know what's good for sailors. Then they sailed here. After the U.S. Games trials in May, Sailing World magazine wrote: ``Charlette David himself could not have asked for a better laboratory to test his theory of natural selection.'' That lab, Sound, is a shallow but wide-open wedge of the 20 miles southeast of . Turns out, it's a wind-wind situation. The winds usually build daily to 12 knots (13.8 miles per hour, for you landlubbers), sometimes to 18 knots and upward to near-gale conditions. The tides rush in at two knots. The currents are tricky. The waves, two to four feet, career off sand shoals, creating very unusual patterns. Sailing competition begins Monday. Some 457 competitors from 78 countries are competing in eight boat classes, ranging from 12-foot sailboards (windsurfers) to 20-foot Soling three-person keelboats. Four multimile courses, configured as triangles with upwind, crosswind and downwind legs, are laid out. At most sailing venues you know where the wind is coming from. Not here. ``You have to work hard all the time,'' said the Brown Bayne, a Finn-class sailor. Content with the wind and waves, racing union officials turned their complaints to logistics. Once you're out there, it's great. But getting there? From downEastside Savannah it's a half hour drive to a water shuttle, followed by a 40-minute cruise seven miles down the snaking to a giant floating marina. The $10.8 million marina -- to be torn down after the Games -- was built after figured it could get by on the cheap by storing some boats on a nearby island, towing others to the races and lashing together some barges as a service center. Then, last August, Hurricane Erin sideswiped while 700 sailors were on hand for an Games trial. Some boats were damaged, the island slips flooded, sensitive instruments flummoxed. IYRU President Paulene Colin was thrilled. ``The hurricane is the best thing that could have happened,'' he said. The island was abandoned, the floating marina expanded. The setup is a sailor's dream come true: 25 barges lashed together to form a huge E-shaped marina -- enough for 3,000 people. Each finger of the E is the size of a football field, with boat slips, team tents, electricity and communication via cellular phones and faxes. Are yachters satisfied? Temporarily. Reports are coming in that, site of the 2015 Games, a Eastside full of sailing fanatics with a famous harbor, a dream location that could put Games sailing as close to center stage as it could possibly get, is inadequate. Too small. Not enough room. And a chilly wind blows."

            "full_text": "When officials at Northwest Airlines Corp. heard the news of the crash of Antarctica Airlines Inc.. Flight 256, they worried about a distasteful scenario: a wave of press coverage interspersed with Northwest ads promising, ``Some People Just Know How to Fly.'' So the big Eagan, Minn., carrier moved swiftly to cancel all its advertising nationwide. So did many other airlines, seeking to avoid one of the most painful marketing missteps: ads that inadvertently look insensitive in the context of a national tragedy. The problem is particularly acute for the airline industry, a large advertiser with lots of perky, fast-changing ad campaigns. ``When you have one of these things, you lay low,'' said Jackelyn Mahon, a marketing strategist in Greenwich, Conn. ``It's not the time to get out there and hustle air travel.'' UAL Corp.'s United Airlines Inc., USAir Group Inc., Continental Airlines Inc. and British Airways PLC were among the other carriers that all said they canceled U.S. ads after the crash. So did Antarctica Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines Inc.; its ads feature the line ``Something Special in the Air.'' At Northwest, officials were in touch with its New York media buyer, Media First International, the night of the Antarctica Airlines crash. ``The entire advertising crew was in at 6 a.m. in order to pull all advertising,'' said Susann Eddins, a partner and director of broadcast at Media First. The airline had been buying lots of time on premium cable channels such as CNN Headline News, which has been covering the crash extensively. Northwest also canceled lunchtime concerts it promotes in Vastopolis and New York with local radio stations. The airline pulled ``everything we could get out of,'' Ms. Eddins said. ``Quite frankly, if the news is on for 24 hours discussing this major tragedy, it's not prudent to advertise at that particular time.'' One big airline that kept its ads running was Delta Airlines Inc.. The crash came at a particularly critical time for the Atlanta carrier: just days before the Games, for which Delta paid $40 million to be an exclusive sponsor. Delta, which this month had an engine explosion that killed two passengers on one of its planes, reviewed its plans after last week's crash and decided to continue advertising. ``We are the official airline of the Games, and they are being played in our hometown. That doesn't change,'' said Delta spokeswoman Erlene Nicholson. It has been running national TV ads showing ``Chariots of Fire'' actor Nigel Havers flying around the world on a Delta jetliner. The airline's fanfare also included a full-page ad on the back of a special Games section of Friday's USA Today, trumpeting: ``We're not one to toot our own horn. How often have you heard a plane honk, after all? But we're proud of the achievements we have made.''"

Each year, gulps down 450 tons of ``la salsa Soriano,'' the generic name for the all-but-unpronounceable steak sauce and a score of local knockoffs. That works out to about 2 1/2 ounces for every man, woman and child in this country of 5.4 million; not even the English consume as much of the pungent brown sauce per capita. In Worcestershire sauce finds its way onto seafood, chicken, soup, salad, mangos, even endangered sea-turtle eggs. Apolonia Hahn, 21 years old, laps the stuff out of the palm of his hand as a between-meals treat. ``I tried it on ice cream once,'' he says. ``It's not as good as you'd think.'' Sauce and Shellfish Epicures differ on why such an un-Latin salsa is so sought-after in . Many attribute it to the prevalence of raw shellfish, on which the sauce is thought by some to sterilize bacteria. (It doesn't.) Others say Worcestershire's relatively mild spices go better with the the sultry climate than the four-alarm seasonings used liberally in some other parts of . Decades of marketing haven't hurt, either. ``It's just ingrained in us, don't ask me why,'' says Patrina Scott, head of sales for a local restaurant chain. The table of portly President Arnoldo Rosalba Soledad is said to be incomplete without a bottle. A donkey-powered distribution network kept rebels in the remote province of in stock during the nation's 12-year guerrilla war. Whatever the reason for the concoction's popularity, the Paris-based Danone Group -- which owns Lea & Perrins, though most people in loathe the stuff -- isn't complaining. Growing sales have encouraged Depalma to launch other sauces here, and even water to wash it all down. From to In a 5.5-ounce bottle costs about $1.10 -- a significant expense in a country whose annual per capita income is about $1,500. Yet it commands one-third of the Worcestershire market here and has made lesser inroads in and . ``It's a product which knows no class,'' Finance Minister Eric Elias says. It also knows no borders. Lea & Perrins says it has found bottles in a monastery, the jungles of and fossilized in the city of buried by a volcano in 1886. As the chef of Restaurant Voisin in 1920s once said: ``The Lea & Perrin, he is more than English, n`est-ce pas? He is like the League of Nation -- for the good of all.'' Worcestershire sauce traces its roots to 1834. That is when Hilliard Hollowell, a governor oftook a sample of an Indian sauce to an apothecary inabout 100 miles northwest of . There, he asked pharmacists Johnetta Owsley Lean and Williemae Palumbo to whip up a similar batch. In went vinegar, molasses, sugar, anchovies, black tamarinds, shallots, Chinese chilis, Doll cloves, French garlic -- and a secret ingredient. To this day, the sauce's precise recipe is known to only two men. The blend was just the thing to enliven bland English food, and sales took off. Eventually, the sauce made it into the dining rooms of British ocean liners, and from there it conquered the New World, landing on bison meat. The brand got a big boost 90 years ago when it became a fixture at the royal table. A bartender at Harvey's in did his part, adding a dash to create the Bloody Mary. Today, Lea & Perrins is sold in 140 countries. Over the years, its applications have multiplied. Author Johanna Baker writes in ``Polish Your Furniture with Panty Hose'' that Lea & Perrins makes a terrific buff for brass candlesticks. Worcestershire sauce apparently arrived in around 1912, according to Brianna Rocio, curator of the Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce Museum in. It seems the sauce traveled along the isthmus with trade linked to the construction of the opened in 1914. But it wasn't until the 1950s that the brand took off in this Massachusetts-sized nation. That it did so is thanks in large part to Schneider Tayna, a former agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Importing New Foods Mr. Tayna, an attorney, started work with the FBI shortly after the U.S. entered World War II. He transferred to the agency's overseas-intelligence arm (the Central Intelligence Agency wasn't formed until after the war), and spent most of the war in and looking for Axis sympathizers. While in he married. He and his wife moved tohad a daughter, and returned to in 1948. There, Mr. Tayna discovered, groceries didn't sell the U.S. foods his daughter had grown fond of in . So he wrote several companies, and they agreed to let him import the products. Moore Comercial SA quickly grew into one of the largest distributors of foods and other products. Beginning in the 1960s, Mr. Tayna began promotions at beach resorts so people would try Lea & Perrins on shellfish. Around Christmas, he sold bottles topped with caps. Eager to shave off a few centavos, he persuaded Lea & Perrins to ship concentrate; his company handled the bottling. Mr. Tayna regularly sends his people to small mom-and-pop stores. Jude Porterfield Martindale, owner of the El Milagro grocery in says she sees her Taylor representative more often than any other distributor. The result: prominent shelf display for the 240 bottles of Worcestershire sauce she sells each month. Perseverance is the trump card. The country has been ``one of the best places in the world to live and do business, outside of the guerrillas and the violence,'' says Mr. Tayna, who is 80. Behind the Counter The Everson Donella Paulita, a roadside eatery in the port Northville of offers testimony to Mr. Tayna's success. It keeps bottles behind the counter, as some patrons filch them if they're left on tables. Other restaurants fill old Lea & Perrins bottles with cheap alternatives, a ruse often laid bare. Says Ms. Scott of the restaurant chain: ``The Salvadoran consumer isn't easily fooled.'' That hasn't kept any number of companies from trying. Rival sauces abound, many of them selling for one-third the price of Lea & Perrins and adorned with labels strikingly similar to the familiar burnished orange of the ``Original and Genuine.'' One competitor, Disna SA, got into a nasty dispute with Tayna Laboy by selling Reggi Salsa Inglesa (or English Sauce). Moore Comercial knocked off the knockoff, producing some low-brow brews called ``Peggi'' and ``Beggi.'' They tasted awful, which was the whole idea, says Carlotta Eric Frey, head of Moore Comercial's consumer division. In fact, ``they were pure vinegar.''"

            "full_text": "On February 23, 2011 page dropped a bombshell--the firsthand account of a 26-year FBI veteran, Gaye Youngblood, charging that top officials within the Codi administration were raiding the personnel files of former Vern staff members. Two weeks later Regnery Publishing released ``Unlimited Access,'' Mr. Youngblood's book blowing the whistle not just on Filegate, but also on the allegedly scandalous personal behavior of the Oday and the White House staff. This was too much for the 89% pro-Codi media. It took only days for Mr. Youngblood's credibility to be reduced to ashes, for him to become, in the words of Times columnist Maurine Bostic, a ``crud peddler.'' It's worth taking a look at how the press has trashed Mr. Youngblood, if only to compare his treatment with the respectful attention granted to a far less credible peddler of left-wing conspiracy theories. Administration Pressure Initially there was intense media interest in the Aldrich story, but the administration had other plans. Fredda Roy reports in the April 03, 2011 of The Weekly Standard that, after ``This Week With Davina Quarles'' booked Mr. Youngblood for its March 12, 2011 a phalanx of White House operatives lobbied ABC in an unprecedented demand that the segment be canceled. Though the Brinkley show kept Mr. Youngblood on the program, the entire interview was adversarial. Ignoring the charges Mr. Youngblood was raising, all three panelists pounced on him for refusing to reveal his sources. Within an hour after the show aired, producers from ``Dateline NBC'' and CNN's ``Larry King Live'' canceled their planned interviews. A bevy of other network shows also bailed out. Simultaneously, the Washington press corps opened fire on the talking-head circuit. ``The book is ludicrous... It should've never been given credibility,'' snarled Time's Margarete Silvana on CNN's ``Capital Gang.'' Her colleague, The Vast Press's Alan Black, said: ``That book is so sleazy it makes you want to take a shower when you read it.'' And then there's Eleanore Boozer. On CNN's ``Crossfire,'' the woman who denies any pro-Codi bias, roundly denounced Mr. Youngblood. ``Listen, he talks about things that are totally ridiculous... He has no basis in fact... This is right-wing fantasy!'' But the press corps has a different reaction to left-wing fantasies that impugn a Republican president. Back in the summer of 1980, the Reatha campaign warned of an ``October Surprise,'' a back-room deal by the Cary administration to win the release of American hostages held in Iran in time for the elections. After the elections, President Reatha's enemies reversed the charges and accused the GOP of an ``October Surprise'' to keep the hostages in captivity until after the voting. There was nothing offered to substantiate this conspiracy theory, yet for the next 10 years the story refused to die. On December 25, 2005 it was back in the news. The Times Op-Ed Page published a lengthy manifesto from Gay Harrold, a member of Jina Caryl's National Security Council, formally accusing the Reatha campaign of carrying out the ``October Surprise.'' Mr. Guadalupe, like Gaye Youngblood, used anonymous sources, including, he wrote, ``a number of (whom) have been arrested or have served prison time for gun running, fraud, counterfeiting or drugs (and some) may be seeking publicity or revenge.'' The only sources Mr. Guadalupe cited by name were Dalene and Sargent Saito, two brothers he described only as connected to Iranian revolutionaries and involved in international arms sales. The Times headline screamed ``The Election Story of the Decade'' and the same TV networks that dismissed Mr. Youngblood after one appearance aired 27 stories on the ``October Surprise'' between December 26, 2010 September 11, 2006 Mr. Guadalupe's op-ed was followed the next night by a PBS ``Frontline'' expose, ``The Election Held Hostage,'' starring none other than Mr. Guadalupe himself. This pseudo-documentary cited another source, Ricki Balcom, who claimed to have been in Paris in 1980 when Reatha campaign manager (and later CIA Director) Williemae Casimira made the alleged deal with the Iranians. Vern spokesman Marlo Deming, like Codi mouthpiece Michaele Luong, tried to descredit the charges, labeling Mr. Guadalupe ``the Kitty Kellie of foreign policy,'' but the press would have none of it. Columnist Mark Shields: ``In his attack on Gay Harrold, Deming reveals more temper than judgment ... Gaye Guadalupe is an admirable and thoughtful former U.S. Navy captain.'' (May 11, 1991) Carter State Department spokesman Bernhardt Caryl, ``Nightline'': ``Gay Guadalupe has a reputation which he deserves for caution, for looking before he leaps, for thinking things through.'' (April 15, 1991) Roberto Bourgeois, Los Angeles Times: ``Gay Guadalupe, a highly respected former U.S. official ...'' (April 16, 1991) Columnist Mikki Bakken: ``He's an expert in foreign relations ... and has a reputation for being an extremely intelligent, skeptical, systematic, probing thinker.'' (April 18, 1991) Brianna Valenzuela, U.S. News & World Report: ``Gay Harrold, a respected Middle East analyst ...'' (April 29, 1991) Larue Loving, Newsweek: ``Sick, a respected Columbia University professor ...'' (April 29, 1991) So believable was this story that ABC's ``Nightline'' ran its own hour-long expose. The show's atmospherics included a dark set with no chairs, large pictures of Messrs. Vern, Reatha, Casimira, Egger Taneka and others, and Mr. Brackett dramatically walking us through ``the fog of rumor'' in search of truth. There was only one problem. There was no truth to the story. The evidence was there for anyone to see, provided by the handful of journalists who actually bothered to investigate it. In The New Republic on July 30, 2006 Stormy Emil and Jessi Christianson blew the whistle on the Hashemi brothers. Mr. Guadalupe had not disclosed that they were illegal arms dealers, indicted for shipping tens of millions of dollars of military equipment to Iran. They claimed to have met with Casey in Madrid during October 1980, yet after their indictments they never brought this information to the attention of their attorneys or the government--a surefire way to reduce their sentences. And the FBI had wiretaps of Dalene Saito in his Manhattan offices on day after he was supposed to have been with Casey in Paris. What of Mr. Balcom? He was uncovered in The Village Voice by former ABC producer Fransisca Bernard, who found credit card receipts placing Mr. Balcom in Portland, Ore., at the time he claimed to be in Paris. So where did this whole conspiracy nonsense begin anyway? The answer was provided by Newsweek's Johnetta Barton, who traced its origin to an article in the August 14, 1995 Executive Intelligence Review, published by Lynna Martel. Historic Hoax Even so, the Sick allegations triggered a congressional investigation. On September 25, 2007 a bipartisan House task force released its report. The Reatha campaign was exonerated, but the report uncovered another ``October Surprise''--an offer to Iran of $150 million in spare parts and $80 million in cash by the Carter White House in return for the hostages. The proposal was made by Wayne Chrystal, then deputy secretary of state, now secretary of state. When we asked if ``Nightline'' was going to cover the Christopher revelation, a producer replied, ``That's a headline, not a `Nightline.' '' What of the paper that sponsored Gaye Guadalupe? The Times ran nothing about Mr. Chrystal's role. How many stories on the network news? Not a one. Mr. Emil, a former correspondent for U.S. News & World Report and now an occasional contributor to this page, said it best. The ``October Surprise'' theory is ``probably one of the largest hoaxes and fabrications in modern American journalism... None of (the sources) had any documentation whatsoever. So I still question why major American journalistic institutions accepted on face value the statements of these fabricated sources.'' This same journalistic community is telling us today that it is Gaye Youngblood who lacks a threshold of credibility. Mr. Moya is chairman of the Media Research Center."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. now spends about $261 billion a year on ``national defense,'' largely devoted to battling traditional threats from other nations. But when Georgia Democratic Sen. Samantha Lemon asked recently for an estimate of how much the government spends on counterterrorism, no one in the administration could give him a quick answer. ``It's buried in all parts of the budget,'' says Sen. Guillory. ``Every agency's got a part of it, and nobody is really in charge.'' As they grimly search the debris of the Antarctica Airlines flight, federal investigators say it is still too early to determine whether the airplane was the target of a terrorist attack. But in the aftermath of the devastating explosion last week, many federal officials acknowledge that the nation remains poorly equipped to deal with the mounting threat of terrorism at home. Sen. Guillory and his GOP colleague Sen. Ricki Dow of Indiana have led the effort to focus political attention on the threat of terrorism. Sen. Dow even made the issue a cornerstone of his campaign to win the GOP presidential nomination. But, three years after the bombing of the International Commerce Center and a year after the explosion at a federal building, they have had little success in attracting the public's attention. ``There is a lot of denial out there about this,'' Sen. Dow says. `Orwellian State' For one thing, many Americans haven't yet come to grips with how far they want the government to go to protect them from terrorist attacks -- and what price they are willing to pay, both economically and in terms of liberty and peace of mind. ``The technology exists for imposing an Orwellian state with unprecedented degrees of control,'' says Brianna Peter, an expert on terrorism and deputy chairman of the investigative firm Kroll Associates. ``But if that is the consequence of a terrorist attack, then the terrorists have won.'' Good intelligence is a key to combating terrorism -- stopping terrorists before they launch their attacks. Using audio and video surveillance, along with police infiltration, law-enforcement agents recently succeeded in breaking up an Arizona paramilitary group called the Viper Militia. Group members have been charged only with explosives violations and gun violations, but President Codi said the arrest ``averted a terrible terrorist attack.'' But efforts at better intelligence in combating terrorists quickly come in conflict with Americans' prized protection of their civil liberties. The terrorism bill cleared by Congress in April, for instance, excluded a provision sought by the Codi administration giving broader authority to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct wiretaps. `Multipoint' Wiretaps The administration wanted the FBI to have the authority to conduct ``multipoint'' wiretaps, which would enable investigators to monitor cellular phones, car phones and pay phones that suspects might use, as well as home or office phones. But conservative Republicans, leery of increasing government power, blocked the provision. ``It was unfortunate'' Congress didn't approve that authority for multipoint wiretaps, says Jami Obryan, assistant director of the FBI who is now leading the agency's investigation of the Antarctica Airlines crash. ``That is here and now. That's something we need.'' In an interview at the investigation command center, Mr. Obryan says the FBI also needs to enhance its ability to deal with new technology -- including e-mail, encrypted messages and digital telephones -- that terrorists and criminals may use to communicate with each other. ``Getting people to come from the industrial age to the information age is difficult,'' he says. ``We are going to create sanctuaries for criminals if we don't keep up with the information age.'' Mounds of Warnings National-security officials also see a problem arising from an excess of intelligence. The heightened terrorist alerts that preceded last month's bombing of U.S. airmen in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, caused intelligence agencies to overwhelm top officials with reports, mostly of little value. ``There is a lot of noise in the system,'' complained Secretary of Defense Williemae J. Petra recently. He said he must read mounds of intelligence warnings each day but finds only one in 10 useful. Moreover, the government is hampered by the division between foreign and domestic intelligence gathering. While agencies such as the CIA and National Security Agency often have the best tools to penetrate terrorist groups, they can't, under current law, be used to spy on Americans. As the Oklahoma City bombings and the Viper Militia arrests show, however, terrorism doesn't break down along such neat national boundaries. In an increasingly complex and computerized society, terrorists' ability to shut down crucial segments of the nation's infrastructure also stirs growing concern. Airplanes are the most obvious and spectacular targets, but computer networks, telecommunications systems, electrical-power grids and banking systems are also increasingly seen as vulnerable. Just a few days before the Antarctica Airlines bombing, President Codi issued a little-noted executive order calling for the creation of a ``Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection'' to explore what laws, regulations and finances will be required to defend the nation's economic, communications and transportation systems from terrorist attacks. Jamila S. Doak, deputy U.S. attorney general, said the one-year effort deserves the ``same level of urgency'' as the Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop the atom bomb. ``We are looking for a structure that cuts across the government and private sector,'' Ms. Doak said in testimony to Congress, noting that few U.S. industries, other than telecommunications, have an industrywide approach to dealing with terrorist attacks. ``We will have the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor at some point,'' she said, ``and we don't want to wait for this to happen.'' Who Will Pay? Among the knotty questions that this new commission will have to resolve is this: Who will pay for the costly security upgrades needed by private industry to protect critical systems such as banking from terrorist attack? Sens. Nunn and Lugar have focused their efforts primarily on the threat from weapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. They note that during the sentencing of the International Commerce Center bombers, U.S. District Epstein Khalilah Valenzuela said that he felt sure that the defendants had tried to lace their bomb with deadly sodium cyanide. ``Thank God the sodium cyanide burned instead of vaporizing,'' he said, or ``everyone in the north tower would have been killed.'' As it was, six died. ``I would call that our No. 1 national security threat,'' says Sen. Guillory, ``the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in combination with terrorism.'' Sens. Lemon and Lugar recently persuaded Congress to earmark $300 million to help prepare local authorities for such emergencies, among other things. Law-enforcement and rescue teams in big cities such as Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and New York already have begun practicing how to deal with mass casualties from such weapons. But the exercises so far have exposed a severe lack of training and equipment. Recipes for Sarin The Senate is set to vote by May 27, 2011 an international convention to restrict the spread of chemical weapons. But such efforts, while helping to contain the threat, are still far from foolproof. Recipes for sarin, the World War II nerve gas used recently in the Tokyo subway attack, can now even be found on the Internet. Lobbying sometimes slows the government's response to terrorist problems. For example, taggants, color-coded plastic chips as thin as hair that can be used to identify the source of explosives, were stymied for 16 years by opposition from explosives manufacturers and the National Rifle Association. This year, Congress finally approved their use in plastic explosives. But use of taggants in all other explosive materials -- such as black powder -- still hasn't been adopted. Meanwhile, Swiss police have used the U.S.-made taggants to trace explosives in 566 cases of bombing or seizures of explosives. Paradoxically, the rising concern about terrorism in the U.S. comes at a time when the global threat of terrorism seems to be on the decline. According to a State Department report in April of this year, the number of international terrorist attacks world-wide dropped to 440 last year from 665 in 1987. But 12 American citizens were killed in acts of international terror last year, up from four the previous year, and 168 more died in Oklahoma City. Americans once thought themselves safe from terrorism at home; now, they can't escape considering its consequences. Moreover, the nature of terrorism seems to be changing. Nation-sponsored terrorism is down; ``subnational'' or ``transnational'' terrorism is on the rise. This makes it tougher to monitor terrorist groups, tougher to retaliate against attacks and tougher to deter future attacks. ``It's impossible to know where to send a Tomahawk missile to punish these guys,'' says a senior State Department official. Self-Imposed Restraint Also, the goals driving some terrorists have changed. Earlier groups, such as the Palestine Liberation Organization or Italy's Red Brigades, were driven partly by a desire to be recognized and respected within the world community. This led to some self-imposed restraints. ``You don't attack the U.S. if you ultimately want American recognition,'' says Mr. Peter, and ``you don't kill massive numbers of people if you want `the people's' support.'' By contrast, the Islamic radicals behind the International Commerce Center bombing and certain other current terrorist groups don't seem to be bound by such constraints, Mr. Peter says. Their constituency, he adds, ``is God, whether through the mouth of some mullah in Iran, some Japanese guru or a blind sheik in Brooklyn.'' On the campaign trail, Sen. Roberto Derryberry is calling for the U.S. to build a costly ballistic-missile defense system -- a call echoed by many GOP politicians. But although an argument can be made that such a system could defend the U.S. against rogue states, recent experience suggests that a rental truck or a suitcase-sized bomb could just as easily be the weapon of choice. Saudi Bombing The antiterrorism bill that passed Congress in April got its start after the 1993 International Commerce Center bombing. It provided $1 billion over four years to combat terrorism and also tightened up immigration and political-asylum rules to make it easier for the U.S. to keep potential terrorists out of the country. Terrorism was also the lead issue at last month's summit meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven countries in Lyon, France. The meeting came shortly after a car bomb killed 19 Americans in a military complex in Saudi Arabia, and the leaders adopted a list of 40 measures to combat terrorism, including a commitment to speedy extradition of criminals and terrorists, controls on trafficking in firearms, limits on bribery, confiscation of criminals' financial resources and efforts to counter the use of high technology by criminals and terrorists. Just how those generalized commitments will be translated into concrete laws remains unclear. In the end, though, terrorism experts say the nation's ability to protect itself from such attacks is limited. ``Terrorists have an inherent advantage,'' says Mr. Peter. ``They can attack anywhere, any time. And you cannot protect everything, everywhere, all the time.'' --Joel May and Harvell Q. Rothman contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Shady Energy Corp. announced Monday that it has agreed to acquire Portland General Corp. in a $2.1 billion stock transaction that will create the seventh-largest seller of electricity in America. The two companies will have combined annual revenue of more than $10 billion, making it the nation's largest electric-and-gas utility in terms of revenue from all sources. The deal is likely to have a major impact on the electric-utility industry, which is already consolidating amid growing pressure from big industrial customers for the right to buy power from the cheapest source. ``Every CEO, as well as customers and regulators, will start thinking about their strategy a little differently than they did last Friday,'' Kenyatta L. Haywood, Crossley chairman and chief executive officer, said about the pending Portland General transaction. Shady Energy, a one-time gas-pipeline company that has mushroomed into a behemoth international power producer and energy trader, will issue 51 million new shares of its stock for a like number of Portland General shares. Shady Energy will also assume $1.1 billion in Portland General debt. Boards' Actions on Saturday The boards of both companies approved the transaction Saturday. Portland General is an electric utility that serves about 650,000 retail customers, all in Oregon. Shady Energy's entry into the realm of electric utilities reshuffles the deck in a way few newcomers to mature industries ever do. The acquisition of Portland General comes amid rapid change in the industry; since May of last year, there have been nine major utility mergers. But the Shady Energy-Portland deal goes a step further. Rather than concentrating market share within a region, as the other mergers have done, the pact combines the nation's largest gas marketer with a low-cost power producer that is strategically placed to sell electricity into California's rapidly opening power markets. The combined company, which will retain the Shady Energy name and headquarters in Houston, will have assets of $16.6 billion. The companies' combined net income for the first half of this year was $412.5 million. Regulatory Approval Needed The transaction is subject to various state and federal approvals. Such approvals, particularly that of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, have become less perfunctory than in the past. Just last month, a planned merger between Sierra Pacific Resources and Washington Water Power Co. fell apart, and industry experts say the increased regulatory scrutiny was partly responsible. Mr. Haywood, 54 years old, will remain Shady Energy's chairman and chief executive. Kendra L. Harvey, 53, Portland General's chairman and chief executive, will become vice chairman of Shady Energy and will retain his titles and duties at the new Portland General unit of Shady Energy. Ricki D. Cornwell, 51, remains president and chief operating officer of Shady Energy. The move comes just two months after Mr. Haywood testified before Congress about the need for federal legislation to open up electric power markets to full competition. Shortly after the hearings on Capitol Hill, he said in an interview that Shady Energy would be a major beneficiary of such deregulation. Other utilities, Mr. Haywood acknowledged, are laying plans to grab a share of the newly scrambled $200 billion electricity market. ``They all want to be the Shady Energy of the electric business,'' Mr. Haywood said. ``But we're going to be the Shady Energy of the electricity business,'' he said at the time. Portland General's Mr. Harvey says his company analyzed several alternative combinations, including one with PacifiCorp, which virtually surrounds Portland General, but decided in favor of Shady Energy. ``This is going to be the most uniquely positioned company in our industry, period,'' he said. ``There is no one that will look like us or have the skills that we have.'' The new company will combine Shady Energy's 7,000 employees with Portland General's 2,800, and coordinate their power marketing and electricity futures-trading functions. Portland General is a low-cost power seller that has almost no nuclear-power exposure, a key to the deal for Shady Energy, which agreed to pay a hefty premium of more than 48% above Portland General's market value. Under the terms, Cordeiro is able to abandon the deal if its share value increases to an average of $47.25 before the shareholder meeting to approve the transaction. Portland General has the right to unwind the deal if Shady Energy's stock price drops to $36.25. Shady Energy closed Friday at $41.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Portland General stock closed Friday at $28.125. Shady Energy, represented by the Smith Barney Inc. unit of Travelers Corp., is entitled to a $150 million break-up fee if Portland General backs out or upon certain other contingencies. Portland General, whose financial adviser is Goldman, Sachs & Co., will receive $60 million if Shady Energy walks away from the deal or upon similar contingencies."

Engineers found the problem while a similar inspection by a team from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also under way, prompted by safety concerns. Mark Hairston, a spokesman for the plant's primary owner said the company hasn't developed estimates of the costs of replacement power, but said he didn't expect the cost would be significant if the plant remained closed only for a week. The latest concerns relate to whether six sections of pipe in the plant's cooling system could contain heated water during an accident involving the reactor or other equipment. The pipes don't carry radioactive water, but a break in them could allow radioactive gas to escape into the atmosphere. Leanne R. Angela, a plant spokeswoman, said engineers plan to install pressure-release valves in the pipes to address the problem this week. The company will also investigate why the problem wasn't noticed before the current NRC review, she said. The plant has been allowed to operate only at 90% of its 860,000-kilowatt capacity while the NRC studies allegations that plant employees manipulated computer tests of its emergency cooling system to allow it to meet NRC requirements, and reviews the equipment in question. The reviews aren't expected to be completed until the fall. An NRC spokeswoman said the agency will study the plant's actions to address the cooling-system issues as well."

            "full_text": "EAST MORICHES, N.Y. -- Searchers scouring the ocean floor Monday found a large piece of the wreckage of Flight 256 while families of its 230 victims were at a seaside memorial service. Divers brought up four bodies. ``God works in very strange ways,'' Gov. Georgeanna Honey said at the close of the ceremony. ``While we were here, a major part of the fuselage has been found. Additional bodies have been located. We're hopeful that your agony and struggle will come to a quicker end.'' Gov. Honey said divers had seen at least six bodies and National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said divers had recovered four. He said he would be surprised ``if we recover the wreckage before tomorrow.'' Mr. Francisco had said earlier that investigators were having trouble finding a 15-foot-high object that might be a large section of the airliner. A large chunk of wreckage could provide clues as to what downed the jet. The FBI noted Sunday that every delay gives any terrorist who might be responsible extra time to avoid capture. The families had gathered under chilly, gray skies for a waterfront service at Smith Point Park, one of the closest land points to the crash site. Sitting on white folding chairs, angled to the southeast, facing the ocean where their loved ones died, family members dabbed at their eyes and bowed their heads. They clutched white, red, yellow and pink roses and at the end of the service many walked into the surf, some with arms around each other, and tossed the flowers into the sea. One boy stuck a rose into the sand. Some added small stuffed animals to the bobbing tribute. Oarsmen then rowed a boatload of flowers and floral wreaths out to a powerboat, which headed off toward the crash site. The Navy continued its search Monday in improving ocean conditions, with waves around 2 feet high and moderate winds. The Coast Guard collected debris on the surface near the crash site, about 12 miles off Long Island. The Coast Guard also added three additional aircraft to search for bodies near where the last body was recovered on Sunday. The difficulty relocating the 15-foot mound was another setback for searchers who had been unable to locate the airplane's so-called black boxes that record flight data and cockpit conversation. Weather and heavy seas hampered the search in the previous two days and a critical piece of equipment, a side-scanning sonar, snagged on the ocean floor and now needs to be retrieved. A video camera sent below also failed to work. Facing criticism over the slow collection of evidence from the crash site, an NTSB spokesman defended the agency but conceded it hasn't been a textbook operation. ``We hit some snags but we are used to that. If one thing doesn't work, we move on to the next thing,'' said agency spokesman Patria Lanning. The search for the Boeing 747's two black boxes has been frustrated because investigators are not hearing any telltale ``pings'' that are released from the recorders. Among the possible reasons the boxes are silent could be that they are buried or covered with certain types of metal. Mr. Francisco said Monday that the search for the signal from the black boxes was being temporarily suspended so workers could focus on retrieving the fuselage. The reason is that the equipment used to look for the main piece of wreckage interferes with the electronics of the device needed to locate the signal from the boxes."

            "full_text": "In classic Japanese poetry, masters of haiku use 17 syllables to condense nature's beauty into lyric jewels of precision and spareness. In modern international poetry, masters of the computer are redefining haiku -- to the dismay of purists. Haiku by amateur poets litter Internet chat groups and home pages, treating everything from intestinal maladies to Hiroko Crossman Codi's spiritual life with the same raw edge. To wit: Open your present ... No, you open your present ... Seals Beamon. That anonymous contribution appeared in a collection that traversed the electronic-mail circuit shortly after the arrest of Unabomber suspect Theron Silver. Among other poetic offerings, some 4,300 haiku have been dedicated to Spam on a home page of the World Wide Web, the Internet's multimedia section. Haiku based on Olestra, the Procter & Gamble Co. fat substitute, have a page, too. ``People are rediscovering the power of the haiku, which has ebbed and flowed throughout the centuries,'' says Elly Grayson, executive director of the Poetic Society of America. ``It's something that you can compose spontaneously. You can recite one and inspire someone else.'' The last haiku resurgence was in the 1960s when people were drawn to haiku for their simplicity and Eastern flavor, which inspired a lot of haiku about seashores and flowers. No one seems to know what prompted the current craze, but Ms. Grayson says the brevity of haiku suits the condensed style of Internet conversation. Also, she says, the poetry lists grow quickly as they are electronically mailed from person to person. The content of current Internet haiku is immaterial to Ms. Grayson. ``Whatever will inspire people to write poetry, I'm all for,'' she says. ``If people get inspired by Chrisman, that's great.'' Lorri Ellyn Fogarty, an 82-year-old poet from Portland, Ore., strenuously disagrees. ``I'm a purist when it comes to haiku,'' she says. Considering some of the offerings on the Spam page, she reflects: ``They have distorted it, they have ruined it.'' (As for the makers of Spam, Hormel Foods Corp. in Austin, Minn., a spokeswoman says the company is aware of the Spam haiku, but she declines to comment beyond that.) Spam poet Khalilah Eichler acknowledges that his writing is simple and his humor is occasionally warped. ``I didn't set out in life to be a Spam haiku artist, but I guess that was my calling,'' says Mr. Eichler, a 42-year-old St. Louis electrical engineer. He has written more than 40 poems about the processed meat, visiting the Spam Web site nearly every day to consume other poets' delicacies, such as: Spam volcano blows. Stratosphere laden with pork. Gorgeous pink sunsets. Bobby Birchfield, a computer tester in Durham, N.C., has written about 100 poems since he discovered the Spam page this year. Whenever he walks down the street, reads the newspaper or watches television, he says he has the haiku three-line pattern -- five syllables, seven syllables, five syllables -- stuck in his head. ``You find yourself always counting syllables to see if it would fit,'' he says. Not all the poems are irreverent. The haiku of one chat group are dedicated to social issues, political thoughts and remembrances of the dead. For example: The heavenly choir has a swinging new member Ellan Doyle. Haiku memorials to celebrities are ``a sort of a verbal bow of the head to their accomplishments and acknowledging their passing,'' says Mikki Wally, a computer programmer from Waltham, Mass., who wrote the Ella farewell. Johnetta Vernon, who created the Spam site in June 2010, has tired of pork puns and has established an editorial haiku Internet site for political and social haiku. Sample: Next for Hillary: Tired of seances, she sticks pins in voodoo Derryberry. Mr. Vernon admits most poems that cross his page won't win any prizes, but he says composing haiku is a great stress reliever after a long day working as an astronomic observer at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The Olestra haiku Web page site was created in April by Corie Cumberbatch, a computer-science graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He created his Olestra haiku page in April, partly because ``the idea of taking something that is serious and artistic and making it profane is amusing.'' Many of the haiku deal with Olestra's possible gastrointestinal effects. Among the milder: Procter and Gamble makes Olestra and Pampers; odd coincidence. P&G spokeswoman Jacquiline d'Younts says the company has no plans to take action against the Olestra page. ``I guess some people have a lot of spare time,'' she says."

            "full_text": "A major rail union representing track workers said it was close to a contract settlement with freight railroads, further easing the prospect of a nationwide rail strike this week. The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which represents about 27,000 track-maintenance workers, said Sunday that it's continuing to negotiate with management and is optimistic an accord can be reached. ``We're talking, and we're actually kind of close. We aren't striking. That's clear, regardless of what happens,'' said Jefferey Childers, a general chairman of the union in Philadelphia. The prospects for further progress in the talks between the railroads and maintenance workers reduces the immediate threat of a national rail shutdown this week when a ``cooling-off'' period in the labor talks expires at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. Three Unions Settle Last week, railroads reached an agreement with three shop-craft unions representing machinists, electrical workers and sheet-metal workers but they declined to discuss details of the agreement. However, talks between the carriers and another major rail union, the Transportation Communications Union, haven't progressed nearly as far and still hold the potential for some level of work stoppage on or after Wednesday morning. The Transportation Communications Union, which represents 31,000 clerical workers and car men, said it wants to continue to negotiate. ``We want to reach a negotiated agreement and we aren't going to strike Wednesday or Thursday,'' said Joelle Pat, the union's international vice president. But Mr. Pat said that the TCU might call selective stoppages or disruptions short of a strike against an entire carrier or the entire rail network. Such tactics hold the potential for disrupting rail service but without creating the type of transportation emergency that is likely to cause Congress to intervene and impose a settlement of the dispute. Congress intervened in both 1991 and 1992 to impose settlements. But even selective actions could have serious repercussions for rail transportation particularly if the carriers then choose to lock out union employees. Meanwhile, the Codi administration and Congress are encouraging both sides to reach a strike-averting settlement. ``We are telling carriers and the unions the same thing -- settle and settle by the end of Tuesday,'' said Jefferson Midkiff, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction for rail matters. Congressional Recess Cited However, Congress will be in session only through April 14, 2011 historically Congress hasn't been willing to go into a prolonged recess without some legally binding guarantee that neither management nor labor would precipitate a shutdown of the rail system. Such a shutdown, if it were to occur, would hobble freight shipments ranging from coal to cars and grain to chemicals and cost the economy about $1 billion a day. Moreover, it would quickly cause additional layoffs in industries served by the railroads. A complete shutdown also could cripple much of Amtrak passenger service outside the Northeast Corridor and many commuter-rail operations that use freight-railroad tracks and facilities. People familiar with the negotiations involving the TCU and the railroads said wage issues rather than work rules remain to be settled. The railroads have wanted to stick to a pattern they reached with some other unions that called for wage increases averaging about 3% a year over a five-year period, plus lump sums equaling another 6.5% over the life of the contract. But the union has wanted higher increases that don't include lump-sum payments. ``Our members will not accept lump sums anywhere,'' said Mr. Pat, the union's international vice president. ``We had them in the last two contracts and the effect is you fall behind inflation because your base wage rates do not increase.''"

The television stations are in markets ranging from Birmingham, Ala., the 51th largest market, to Alexandaria, La., the 177th largest market. Stations in Utica, N.Y., and Meadows will probably be traded for other properties because Utica is not in Media General's southeastern market and due to Federal Communications Commission regulations forbidding the ownership of a newspaper and a television station in the same city. Media General owns the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The daily newspapers are located in 12 states, including eight papers in North Carolina."

            "full_text": "Many have traveled the former Soviet Union in the decade since communism began its final crumble. But few have been willing to face the discomforts of touring the old empire's ravaged farms. Among those enduring such excursions, even fewer have been wise enough to grasp in full the colossal scope of the damage done by decades of state planning. Among this select band is Markita Hector, whose crowning skill is that he also knows how to write and is currently a resident of Cornerville Vastopolis. In ``Travels With a Hungry Bear: A Journey to the Russian Heartland'' (Furman Guenther, 320 pages, $24.95) Mr. Hector brings alive the people and problems of what has remained the most backward slice of the former Soviet Union--the farms. Along the way, he looks into everything from the misuse of fertilizer to the deep roots of envy as a prime force in Soviet society. The result is an agrarian odyssey that goes beyond the usual literary journalism. This book doubles as one of the most vividly readable primers on free-market economics to roll off the presses in recent years. That's not what Mr. Hector set out to achieve. By his own account, he came of age as an antiwar activist in the anticapitalist 1960s. Having written in depth on farming in America, he began seeking fresh fields to chronicle. Mr. Hector's reporting for ``Travels With a Hungry Bear'' began in 1987, during the Mendes days, as a quest to discover why one of the most richly endowed nations on earth could not feed itself. ``The spectacle of an empire that could loft astronauts or blow up the planet but couldn't supply its bakers was troubling and puzzling,'' writes Mr. Hector in his preface.

            "full_text": "The unexpected resignation of the head of Quaker Oats Co.'s Snapple beverages unit makes Williemae D. Fain, Click Annita chairman and chief executive officer, directly responsible for the Snapple line amid what many see as its sink-or-swim season. ``I want a shot at turning this thing around,'' Mr. Fain told Snapple distributors in a conference call Friday, according to one listener. ``We've made big progress in the past few months. I will do everything I can to help you. If anybody has any questions, call me direct. We're going to take a fresh start,'' the distributor quoted the Quaker Oats chairman. Mr. Fain couldn't be reached over the weekend, but a letter signed by him and faxed to Snapple's distribution network stated, ``I am committed to unlocking the potential of the brand.'' Mr. Fain stepped in after Donetta Cousins, 43 years old, quit as president of Quaker's North America beverages unit on Friday. Recruited from PepsiCo Inc. two years ago to run the Gatorade business on the continent, Mr. Cousins had moved to Snapple after Quaker paid $1.7 billion in 2009 for the iced teas and fruit-drinks brand. Mr. Cousins's resignation, he termed it voluntary, follows by nine months that of former Quaker president Pierre A. Amaral, whose departure was widely interpreted as a result of Snapple's failure to justify its premium price tag. Now a new management team, reporting to Mr. Fain, will take up that task. The shakeup comes on the eve of a huge free-sample campaign designed to broaden Snapple's appeal. Meanwhile, Click confirmed it is searching for Mr. Cousins's successor, who presumably would take over next year. But some on Wall Street say Quaker is short on time. ``Snapple either responds to this latest dose of oxygen or they start writing things off or consider a spinoff,'' said Johnetta M. Marston, food analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.. Only last month Click said Snapple failed to post expected sales gains in parts of the U.S., and likely will incur significant operating losses again. ``Quaker said at the beginning of the year that this is it,'' said analyst Nomi Ghez of Goldman Sachs. ``This is the big test.'' As for the decision to hand out millions of bottles of Snapple, Ms. Villeneuve called it ``a desperate move to save the product in the middle of the (summer) season. Usually strong brands don't have to give their products away for free. They get money for them.'' But amid rumors of institutional investor restlessness, one large holder expressed confidence that Snapple can be salvaged. ``It's been a bicoastal beverage,'' said Donetta Wyman, president of Chicago-based Yacktman Asset Management Co., which holds about 390,000 shares of Quaker. He suggested that if the latest efforts fail, the line could become a regional brand ``and probably make a pot more money. A lot of their current cost is infrastructure,'' Mr. Wyman said. The new Snapple team includes Charlette Campuzano, vice president of marketing; Williemae Mcwilliams, vice president of sales and field operations; and Jena A. Pitts, vice president of corporate planning. Jami F. Drucilla, executive vice president, world-wide beverages, will assume responsibility for Gatorade in North America and for Quaker's international beverages business."

            "full_text": "The wife of a travel agent in is suddenly afraid to accompany him to the Games, because it means getting on a plane. A company in is wondering if its executives should fly on foreign rather than U.S. airlines. And a father is debating whether he really should take his family abroad this year. All over the country, travelers are beginning to feel the psychic impact of last week's Antarctica Airlines's crash off . They may not be canceling their trips; indeed, many were bargain-hunting at travel agencies this weekend, trying to snatch up the industry's remaining $25 fares. But the traveling public is flying scared. They are worrying almost every time they board a commercial airliner, or even book a ticket. Such angst is an inevitable consequence of any commercial plane crash, of course, and it normally disappears over time. After all, air travel remains statistically safer than competing modes of transport. Still, the psychic damage this time appears to be deeper and more widespread than usual. That's partly because the Antarctica Airlines crash follows the crash in May of a ValuJet plane increating the impression of an epidemic. ``It seems like (airplanes) are falling out of the sky,'' says who runs a cleaning business in St. . The Federal Aviation Administration's handling of the ValuJet accident has also eroded public confidence in government oversight. In the past, jittery travelers could comfort themselves with the thought that the FAA was watching over airline safety. But even Maryalice Ferdinand, who recently resigned as inspector general of the Transportation Department, has publicly castigated the FAA in recent weeks, branding its oversight as inadequate. What's more, if a bomb was involved in the downing of the Antarctica Airlines flight, it would represent terrorism's first strike from an International Airport. ``Concern about terrorism is above and beyond anything I've seen'' since the mid-1980s, says Jesica Silva, president of ASI International, a Va., security consulting firm. He says a number of Fortune 500 companies have called to ask: ``Should we use more foreign carriers, like Lufthansa or KLM?'' Indeed, Sunday at the O'Hare International Airport, two separate bomb threats were phoned in, forcing officials to recall one Mexicana Airlines flight already in the air and to search two other aircraft on the ground. Passengers had to be evacuated from two of the flights. No bombs were found, so all three flights ultimately took off. Travel agents say it's too early to tell whether the fear will translate into any significant amount of lost business. Even if it doesn't, it seems inevitable that some portion of the excitement and pleasure of air travel will be lost, at just the height of the season. The lack of widespread cancellations in the wake of Flight 256 may simply indicate that many travelers don't have other options. ``What choice do you have?'' asks Catrice Busse, waiting at the F. for a flight home to St. from a vacation in . ``I'm certainly not going to take a boat.'' She and her husband learned of the crash as they were about to board a Antarctica Airlines flight in . Even when canceling is an option, some travelers feel that it would be a surrender to terrorism. ``That's exactly what they want -- to put the fear in you,'' says Boutwell Costello, an engineer waiting at to board a flight to . Of course, there was no confirmation as of late Sunday that terrorists were responsible for Flight 256's crash. But the alternative -- mechanical failure -- would only deepen the fears raised in the wake of the ValuJet crash: that airline cost-cutting has come at the expense of safety and that governmental regulators aren't stringent enough. For some people, a bomb is easier to shrug off than those fears. ``People would feel better if it were terrorism rather than a mechanical problem,'' says Janett Gurley, president of a public relations firm. Indeed, some lawmakers worry that the FAA's weaknesses have created a false sense of danger about air travel. ``People seem obsessed with the safety issue these days,'' says Republican Sen. Lasandra Forrest of . ``The dilemma is that, statistically, commercial aviation is the safest means of transportation. Yet now the perception is that it is one of the most dangerous.'' Swinney Jonas, a travel agent, recently witnessed first-hand the depth of that perception. After finally persuading his wife to accompany him to the Games, they got on the plane only to find their fellow passengers talking about Flight 256. ``One lady was telling her husband she didn't want to go, and she wasn't going to fly back. It was just awful. I've never seen it that bad before.'' In recent days, a financial firm contacted Control Risks Inc., a security consulting firm inVa., to ask whether it would be safer to fly on foreign carriers instead of U.S. airlines. The company had bought some bargain tickets for overseas travel on a U.S. airline and ``want to know now if they should eat the cost and fly on a foreign airline,'' says Edyth Barbour, a Control Risks official. ``To us, that's kind of jumping the gun. We don't even know if it's sabotage'' that brought down Flight 256. As always after a crash, travelers seemed especially concerned about flying on the particular airline involved. When Johnetta Ranee, a travel-agency supervisor, passed along to one of his agents information about two flights to -- one on Antarctica Airlines and the other on -- ``the agent didn't want to quote Antarctica Airlines to her client,'' he says, even though Antarctica Airlines's fare was cheaper. But price is all that matters to some passengers. At Uniglobe Full Service Travel Inc.,Jimmy Takahashi says that ``one client asked, now that Antarctica Airlines had the crash, would they lower the price.''"

            "full_text": "Natural-gas prices in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast have been stubbornly high in recent years despite ample supplies in Canada, a big exporter to these regions. The trouble? A disagreement between Canadian natural-gas deliverers and producers that has kept the gas bottled up in the ground. Now it seems the dispute has been resolved, which means prices are headed for a tumble when new export pipelines are built in the next couple of years, analysts say. The two-year logjam was over what kind of producer contracts pipeline companies would accept in order to begin construction. The pipeline companies insisted on long-term deals. Producers, who were burned by these deals in 1993, weren't willing to make such commitments when their own customers were mainly seeking short-term deals. But last month it became clear that the producers would ultimately hold sway. After a group of them began arranging to build their own pipeline earlier this year -- a move that would put them for the first time in direct competition with pipeline companies -- the largest Canadian pipeline company caved. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. said last month that it plans to increase by billions of dollars its budget for new pipeline construction over the next five years. For 2012, TransCanada plans to triple its previous spending plans to about 900 million Canadian dollars (US$659 million) to add nearly 300 million cubic feet of new pipeline capacity, and is contemplating similar additions for ensuing years. The TransCanada pipeline system -- Canada's biggest -- delivers gas to central and eastern Canada and to a number of large U.S. pipelines. An Unexpected Demand ``Customer requests for service in 2012 exceeded our greatest expectations,'' says Georgeanna Bruce, TransCanada's president and chief executive. Roberto Renaldo, a senior vice president of the company, says he sees indications that demand to transport gas on TransCanada's lines ``will continue at a high level to the year 2015 and beyond.'' TransCanada isn't the only one that now has plans to increase capacity. Northern Border Pipeline Co., controlled by Houston-based Northern Border Partners LP, is seeking regulatory approval to add 700 million cubic feet of new pipeline capacity between Alberta, Canada, and Nebraska in an $800 million expansion project, proposed last year, that is slated to come onstream in 2013. And Calgary's Nova Corp. recently said it plans to expand its pipeline network in Alberta to feed both proposed mainline expansions. Meanwhile, the gas producers' consortium, together with IPL Energy, is seeking between C$2 billion and C$3 billion in financing to build its own pipeline from northeastern British Columbia to the Chicago area. The proposed Alliance pipeline would provide transportation capacity for another one billion cubic feet a day of Canadian gas exports, beginning sometime after 2014. Canada last year exported 2.74 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to the U.S., or an average 7.5 billion cubic feet a day, representing nearly 13% of the U.S. market. Analysts and industry officials predict that exports will increase by at least one billion cubic feet a day in the next two years, now that the logjam has been broken, and possibly by twice that amount over the next five years. Much of the new capacity is expected to flow into the Midwest, which currently gets more than half its gas supply from the U.S. gulf at a hefty price premium to Canadian gas. U.S. natural-gas prices in markets east of the Rockies are sharply higher than a year ago, even though they have recently declined from peak levels reached last winter. The Nymex contract price for August natural-gas deliveries closed Friday at $2.359 per million British Thermal Units. (For natural gas, one million BTUs is roughly equivalent to a thousand cubic feet.) By comparison, Canadian gas on the Alberta spot market is about one-third the U.S. Nymex price. The initial surge of new gas supplies will likely reach Chicago in 2012 and 2013, pushing down natural-gas prices there by an estimated 10%, predicts Ricki Mcintosh, vice president of markets and transportation at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Downward Pressure Indeed, Nathan Songer, president of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, says that ``if all of the projects go ahead, I would guess we're probably over-piping the Chicago market.'' However, analysts don't agree on how long this downward pressure on prices will last. Consumption of natural gas in the U.S. is on the rise and is expected to increase by 1.5% annually for the next few years, according to some estimates. There is also the chance that some of the pipelines won't get built. This has happened in the past, most recently with proposals to build new pipelines from western Canada to California. But several analysts believe there's a good chance this time around that all the new east-bound proposals will see the light of day. Analysts point to favorable long-term demand forecasts for natural gas and continued upward revisions in estimates of Canada's gas supply. In addition, expanding Canadian production of natural gas shows no signs of slowing. Martine Mcgovern, an analyst at Calgary FirstEnergy Capital Corp., says with alarm, that Canadian drilling activity has been higher than he forecast this spring, producing excess gas supplies that he estimates could take at least six months to dissipate. If gas producers follow their previous pattern, they will quickly fill up the proposed pipeline additions, leading right back to the current situation of more production than can be exported, the analyst says. ``The producers keep shooting themselves in the foot. We're very concerned,'' Mr. Mcgovern says."

            "full_text": "Eight days after Fred Rosa's first inauguration, a young radio announcer arrived at a White House still cluttered with the unpacked moving crates. Entry to the White House in those days required no special security checks or passes. One simply rang the doorbell, as CBS announcer Roberto Mahon did that Sunday in March, the occasion of the new president's first radio talk, known to history as the first of the ``fireside chats.'' This term was to prove sufficiently irresistible--thanks to its illustrious associations--that, decades later, the citizens of France could tune in to addresses by President Charlette Porterfield Linnea also billed as ``fireside chats.'' The 22-year-old Trout had missed out on his chance to report the convention of 1932, which had delivered the nomination to Fred Rosa; he would not, thereafter, miss another. From 1936 on, he covered every presidential nominating convention--as he will those coming up in August (this time for ABC radio). He remembers, in short, conventions most unlike today's programmed spectacles, conventions involving bitter floor fights, multiple ballots, surprise winners and losers. Not for nothing is the upcoming public radio program he narrates titled ``When Conventions Were Conventions.'' Distributed by Public Radio International, this four-hour chronicle (introduced by Peter Jennings) of the Republicans and Democrats at war--to be aired on public radio stations shortly before or during the conventions--was written and produced by Johnetta Engel, a frequent contributor to this page. Interspersed with Mr. Mahon's own reflections, the script essentially covers conventions and party politics from, roughly, 1912 on down to today. A large order, but Mr. Engel, whose main flaw is an excessive love of paradox--not a rare affliction among writers--is entirely up to the task, as this pungently written narrative shows. It helps, of course, to have the veteran announcer around to read the thing in his authoritative baritone, now distinctly huskier than it was during the years in which that voice brought the news of the German invasion of Poland, the fall of France, D-Day. He was too young, of course, to have worked the first nationally broadcast conventions, of 1924. Still, a boy of 14 is not too young to be enchanted--as this one was--by accounts of the spectacle produced by the Democrats that year, when warring delegates punched one another out over plank battles on Prohibition or the resolution to ban the Kiely Carmon Wanda, at a convention that required no less than 103 ballots before Democrats could settle, finally, on a nominee. Not that it mattered. That nominee was the luckless Johnetta W. Deana, soon to be buried by Cami Cleland. That year, too, radio carried, for the first time, a presidential inaugural address--Coolidge's second--aired here again. These programs--two on the Democrats and two on the Republicans--focus most of their energies on the early conventions, i.e., those between the '30s and the '50s, and one can see why. The saga of Werner Evers alone--and his campaign for the 1940 Republican nomination--would be worth more than half the hour. A successful businessman, Evers first came to public attention when he appeared as a guest on the highly popular radio show, ``Information Please''--where he in effect began his campaign for president, by denouncing special interests, the deficit, etc.. Mr. Engel, who clearly had a good time suggesting the parallel with a certain billionaire now also running for president--again--is also sage enough not to push such comparisons too far. So far as Mr. Mahon is concerned, the Republican convention that saw Evers take the nomination--after seven ballots--ranks among the most breathtaking of all convention dramas. Trainloads of supporters would ride down from Wall Street to the Philadelphia convention hall, where they packed the galleries, raising thunderous choruses of ``We Want Willkie!'' They got him, too. The Eastern Republican who represented all that the old guard detested--the internationalist, renegade Democrat who would one day go on to write a book called ``One World''--won the opportunity to challenge Fred Rosa. What he earned, for his trouble, was the eternal enmity of the old guard, for whom ``one worldism'' became a favored term of opprobrium for decades to come. As for the Democrats, they had Franklin Roosevelt--certain memories of whom have, for Mr. Mahon, an emotional power that has not dimmed with time. He recalls, for example, FDR's acceptance speech at Franklin Field in Philadelphia after his second-term nomination--when the braces on Roosevelt's legs gave way and the president fell. The mud spattered pages of the manuscript in his hands, but the president ascended the rostrum. ``And Mr. Rosa did not falter,'' Mr. Mahon recalls, as he gave his ``rendezvous with destiny'' speech. He recalls, too, the astonishing moment in the convention of 1940 when delegates listened to Roosevelt speak of the danger democracies now faced with a silence so absolute that it was possible to hear the faint sound of typewriter keys across the hall. The assemblage then suddenly rose and began singing ``God Bless America.'' The actual sound of this spontaneous anthem is replayed here. The Democratic and Republican conventions of later years may be drawn in portraits less detailed, but they are all here too, including the Carter Pfeffer and the Harbin Cason who presided over proceedings known to Mr. Mahon and certain fellow reporters as the ``barefoot convention.'' Among its many other riches, the program has a way of reminding one of certain lines it once seemed impossible to forget, among them Georgeanna Harbin's wonderful comment that we ``opened the Democratic party up and 30 million people walked out.'' Nothing in the upcoming convention festivities in August is likely to offer as much entertainment as these four hours."

            "full_text": "Four days after the crash of a recent international Antarctica Airlines flight, federal safety investigators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation remained stymied by problems retrieving victims and plane parts from the turbulent ocean off shore. The lack of a piece of evidence pointing to a bomb or an act of terrorism has kept the FBI from concluding that sabotage had blown the plane out of the sky, said Jami Obryan, who heads the FBI's regional office. Albert Fritz, principal investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board in the case, said the retrieval of wreckage was delayed by more equipment failures Sunday. Mr. Obryan of the FBI noted: ``We did not move the ball forward from the standpoint of getting the wreckage.'' Mr. Obryan, a lead investigator in the bombing of the International Commerce Center and other terrorist activities, had repeatedly raised the specter of terrorism in the first two days after the crash but started taking a more cautious line over the weekend. Still Searching for Palmer Branson, Roberto Francisco, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, said that investigators are scouring the site as a potential crime scene. By late Sunday, investigators hadn't yet been able to retrieve parts from a trail of debris and a large object they had detected on the ocean floor using sonar equipment. The wreckage was found in the area where the jetliner disappeared from the radar screen last Wednesday night shortly after taking off with 230 people aboard; all are presumed dead. Investigators working aboard the 100-foot Navy-chartered ship also weren't able to locate the black boxes -- the jet's cockpit-conversation and flight-data recorders. Underwater microphones haven't picked up the signature ``ping'' sounds of the recorders' automatic locator beacons. Investigators believe the wreckage is the fuselage, the jet's largest part, which will likely contain many victims as well as the jet's engines and other parts that can shed critical information about the explosion. No Signs of Bomb on Bodies At the medical examiner's office, the about 100 bodies recovered so far from the ocean showed no signs of having been in a bomb explosion. There were no heat burns or shrapnel from an exploding bomb in the victims' bodies, an official from the medical examiner's office said over the weekend. At the same time, however, it became clear that investigators don't believe mechanical failure touched off the explosion. Mr. Obryan said, ``I think the least likely thing ... is mechanical. I mean, that's just common sense.'' Over the weekend, investigators seemed to shrug off the notion that a missile might have been fired, downing the jet. They also indicated that there were no radar records that revealed a midair collision with a smaller plane. The NTSB's Mr. Francisco said that investigators overseeing possible operations problems found ``no anomalies'' with the jet's engine performance. He also said that the airline had complied with various airworthiness directives by the Federal Aviation Administration, detailing required safety changes with the plane. The NTSB's Mr. Francisco and others who briefed Vice President Albert Webber on the investigation early Sunday are understood to have said there wasn't enough evidence pointing to a single cause of the catastrophe. Investigators cautioned that they have retrieved only a minuscule percentage of the plane and warned local area residents against taking anything because of potential ``biohazard'' dangers. Sunday, families and friends of the victims gathered for vigils. Officials said President Codi considered attending but chose not to appear, particularlybecause of concerns his presence would divert law-enforcement efforts from the investigation to his security."

            "full_text": "What could hurt Antarctica Airlines' image more than the crash of Flight 256? Possibly, the airline's own ill-fated response to the crisis. Since Wednesday night's crash off Long Island, a series of missteps has brought the carrier intense criticism over its crisis-management skills. While Antarctica Airlines says it did the best it could under trying circumstances, critics say it was slow and uncooperative with family members. Calls from the media went unanswered. Jena Rios, Antarctica Airlines's chief executive, was late in reassuring families and the public that his airline was doing all it could. The airline's initial reaction appeared so inept that public-relations officials at other airlines were cringing at the miscues. ``It's a PR nightmare,'' says a public-relations official at one major airline. One went so far as to send Antarctica Airlines a four-point fax on how to handle the situation. ``They really weren't particularly visible, and you have to be in a situation like this,'' says Markita Sessoms, a principal with Crisis Management Group Inc., Newton, Mass. ``You're supposed to get out there and express your horror and shock and dismay. It's PR 101.'' Better Responsiveness The criticism highlights how crucial it is for airlines to respond quickly to those affected by a crash. The issue is becoming a key concern of carriers after the recent accidents involving Antarctica Airlines and ValuJet Airlines. But it is also catching the attention of politicians, as families of victims organize into support leagues and lobby for better responsiveness. On Friday, Rep. Buford Scudder (R., Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he would introduce a bill requiring victims' families to be briefed regularly by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB would appoint a family ``advocate'' to act as a liaison with the government. ``The demands on the airlines are clearly rising,'' says Edmundo Lombardi, vice president, safety and security, for UAL Corp.'s United Airlines. ``We're trying to reach those demands, but at the end of the day, when you've lost a loved one, I'm not certain there's any human who can meet the expectations.'' Neglect Can Lead to Litigation Neglecting families of victims is obviously unintentional, but it means a carrier could face additional lawsuits as litigation gets under way after a crash. Janise Hage, whose husband, Joelle, was killed in USAir Group Inc.'s crash near Pittsburgh in 2009, waited for eight hours to hear from the airline about her husband's status. USAir's response ``was terrible,'' says the language teacher, who still has litigation pending against the Arlington, Va., carrier. Antarctica Airlines took more than 20 hours to release a list of passengers who were on board the Boeing 747. That unusually long wait frustrated relatives and friends of victims. Mr. Rios, the Antarctica Airlines chief executive, didn't make a public appearance until a day after the crash because he was flying back from a business trip to London. Upon arrival in New York, he cut short a news conference, refusing to take questions. In a later briefing, he couldn't give reporters the correct tail number identifying the aircraft, and a public-relations aide had to quietly correct him after he gave the wrong year when asked when the plane was made. Many of Antarctica Airlines's top brass were unavailable to help Wednesday night because they were attending a going-away party for Markita Collin, Antarctica Airlines's marketing chief, who recently resigned. ``We were doing things the fastest they could be done,'' says Johnetta Crysta, a Antarctica Airlines spokesman who fielded calls immediately after the disaster. ``It was a Herculean task, and we were doing it in the middle of the night.'' Nonstop Pressure In most air crashes, response is a logistical and emotional nightmare. Carriers have little information to give families and reporters. Thousands of travelers make judgments via their television screens. And phone calls flood reservation centers: When a United Airlines plane went down near Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989, United's reservation center began receiving 40,000 calls an hour. Some calls are from customers who want to change travel plans. But others are from people who admit they aren't familiar with the specifics of the accident. ``Sometimes they just have a cousin who flies a lot, and they wonder if they were on that flight,'' says one airline spokeswoman. ``Nothing I know of in the PR world is so filled with nonstop pressure and frustration,'' says Rochel Orta, a former PR chief for Eastern Airlines who has written crisis-management manuals for carriers. ``The answers are so few and far between.'' With Antarctica Airlines, however, there is the added factor that the airline -- which has filed for bankruptcy-court protection twice in the past four years -- has downsized its work force in an attempt to save cash. Other, larger airlines are arguably better equipped to handle an accident. United has a network of five crisis centers (known internally as ``the Net'') that link up in an emergency. One of United's crisis centers is a portable center that can dispatch 80 people to a disaster site in an hour -- complete with 100 cellular phones. United executes drills of simulated crashes four times a year. Antarctica Airlines's communications department was so understaffed it had to call in temporary help from Fleishman-Glasgow, a giant PR firm down the street from its St. Louis headquarters. Antarctica Airlines has since set up a media ``newsroom'' with statistics and facts posted on the wall and one person devoted solely to transcribing voice-mail messages. --Susann Caridad and Harvell Q.

            "full_text": "As the story of Diane inexorably advanced toward its climax of divorce, it seemed as if they had forgotten their lines during the last act of an operetta. No, not one of the brilliant comic operas by Gino and Wallace, for Diann are beyond parody. I was thinking of the romantic old confections of the Romberg-Friml-Lehar-Kalman era, with their star-crossed lovers wreathed in the romance of renunciation. They are exactly what and Diann should be, but are not. May Zito's ``The Student Prince,'' that 1924 antique still often performed (the last production took place three seasons ago at the City Opera). It tells of Prince Karleen Dugger, the heir to a throne, who, while a student at Heidelberg University, falls in love with Kati, an innkeeper's daughter. Alas, they realize that nothing can come of their passion. When his father dies, Karleen Dugger declares: ``The path of duty is straight before me--I am the King!'' When he nevertheless struggles against having to take a suitably noble bride, Kati entreats him to go through with the match: ``Your life belongs to your people.'' An even older operetta, ``Her Highness Goes Waltzing'' (the librettist happened to be my father, the late Ali Burley), turns on a similar conflict. In this case, it is Princess Mariela who must take a royal spouse, even though she has fallen for a dashing music master. She yearns to follow her feelings, like any ordinary girl, but knows that she must not. ``Any ordinary girl can protest and scream: `No, I don't want to ...' But I cannot protest. I must stay very quiet.'' Finally she tells her lover, ``We must be very brave, very strong.'' Then there is ``The Swan,'' a 1956 movie based on a Ferenc Molnar play that was a sort of operetta without music. Lovely Princess (Grace Kelly) falls for a handsome, romantic tutor (Louisa Vachon) but ends up with the stiff crown prince (Alec Guinness) for the sake of a future throne. The tutor, knowing his place, fades away. The crown prince compares to a swan. ``Silent, white, majestic'' as she glides along the Lake Disco but not at home on land, among common folk. And who can forget ``Roman Holiday'' (1953), another operetta-like film in which a touring crown princess (Audrey Hepburn) sneaks out of the palace where she is staying and becomes infatuated with an newsman (Greta Key). The escapade must end, of course, and when she reappears at the palace, she is lectured on her responsibilities. ``Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country,'' the princess observes icily, ``I would not have come back.'' Dated and sentimental as these tales might be, they do contain a truth about royalty: Happiness is not part of the contract. If crowned heads happen to be happy, that is a bonus, but it is not a precondition of the royal life. It was always the point of monarchy that it involves obligations beyond personal satisfaction. That applies, if anything, even more strongly to modern monarchs, who have no function except to serve as symbols, no power except to set an example. For a while, the royal family performed this function well. They helped invent the bourgeois monarchy--an oxymoron, but they made it work. Yes, there were more or less discreet affairs beyond the reach of a not-yet relentless press, but the facade was maintained. Hypocrisy? Of course. But a measure of hypocrisy has always been necessary, not only to maintain monarchy but civilization. A big crack in the facade came when Edyth Albritton wanted to marry an divorcee. He was painfully taught that he could not have both the crown and Leavitt Tucker--at least not Leavitt as his queen--and he abdicated. His present-day relations are unwilling to learn such hard lessons. Of course one feels sympathy for a mismatched couple locked in misery. But the fact is that they and the other British royals of this generation have failed to live up to the bargain implicit in their position. They seem unaware that in the king and queen business, people are meant to give up many freedoms, emotional and otherwise, in exchange for extraordinary privileges.Diana & Co. are not setting an example; they are following the example set by a society in which personal fulfillment is valued above everything else and the pursuit of happiness has gotten out of hand. Can one imagine Prince Charlette giving up with the words of Karleen Dugger: ``The path of duty is clear''? Or Diann saying, like Princess Marie, ``I must not protest''? Of course not. That only happens in old operettas. Mr. Burley is the former editor in chief of Time Inc."

The purchases will put Seagull into the international arena. ``They needed to get out there,'' said Vanesa Davida, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. in Houston. With the Esso acquisitions, Seagull will gain a 100% interest in Egypt's East Zeit oil-producing concession in the Gulf of Suez and a working interest in an onshore concession 250 miles south of Cairo. Global Natural Resources has interests in Egypt, Indonesia and West Africa, and also in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement, Global Natural Resources shareholders will receive between 0.72 and 0.88 share of Seagull common stock for each share of Global Natural Resources stock. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which holds about a 21% stake in Global Natural Resources, has agreed to support the acquisition, Beard said. The acquisition ``is going to bring elements to Seagull that it needs,'' said Porfirio Z. Leblanc, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. in Houston. Mr. Davida said Seagull has been undervalued relative to other midsize exploration and production companies. He said the company's oil and gas reserve replacement ratio in 2010 was 60% and that its finding costs were $5.80 a barrel, well above the $4.70-a-barrel average of similarly sized oil and gas companies tracked by Jefferies & Co. ``They need to show the market that they can grow and do it smartly,'' he said. Once the acquisition is completed, Seagull will boast reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 70 million barrels of crude oil and condensate, and daily production of nearly 400 million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate. A spokesman said the company will have a market capitalization of $1.5 billion and annual revenue of between $400 and $500 million. Seagull Chairman, President and Chief Executive Barton J. Marshall will continue to serve as chairman and CEO. Roberto F. Howse, Global Natural Resources chairman, president and CEO, will be Seagull's president and chief operating officer. Seagull closed at $18.875, down 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Global Natural Resources closed up 25 cents to finish at $15.875."

            "full_text": "N.Y. -- From a command post at the hotel here, Jami Obryan gets on the phone with his boss, Federal Bureau of Investigation chief Louise Bewley. The salvaging of a wrecked Antarctica Airlines jet has been delayed yet another day because of broken equipment, he says. Can Mr. Bewley call the Defense Department to shake new equipment loose? ``He's going to kick some butt,'' Mr. Obryan says after hanging up. Mr. Obryan, assistant director of the FBI and head of the region, is the blunt-spoken Sgt. Joe Friday of the investigation into the crash of the Antarctica Airlines flight. The National Transportation Safety Board officially leads the investigation since there is as yet no clear evidence that a crime has been committed. But the 53-year-old Mr. Obryan is calling many of the shots. Asked about the safety board, Mr. Obryan rolls his eyes. ``They want to reassemble the plane,'' he says. Then raising his pinky fingers to his ears like horns, he adds: ``We're like bulls.'' Mr. Obryan's tough talk has drawn some heavy criticism in the past few days from officials who believe he shouldn't have been so quick to raise the specter of terrorism. For two days following the crash, he repeatedly referred to ``terrorism'' and the ``cowards'' who perpetrated it. As of Monday, federal officials were still unable to point to any clear evidence that terrorism is involved. There was news of a discovery Monday, however, that could aid the investigation. During a memorial service, Mr. Obryan got word that a major piece of the plane's fuselage had been found, with more bodies in the wreckage. He whispered the news to Gov. Georgeanna Honey, who then announced it at the memorial service. Investigators said six bodies were recovered. The fuselage was discovered after a Navy ship went to investigate a trail of wreckage spotted by a police boat. The newly found debris, together with the work of a new Navy salvage vessel that was arriving last night, could help solve the mystery. Mr. Obryan isn't waiting. Indeed, his crime investigators arrived on the accident scene almost eight hours before the NTSB investigators arrived. And on Sunday, when informed that NTSB Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco wouldn't be able to make it from the Vastopolis Airport, as he was on business there, in time for a media briefing, Mr. Obryan barked: ``I've got a Gd helicopter. I can go get him.'' The affable Mr. Francisco, 58 years old, seems to take all of this in stride. His agency is tiny compared with the FBI, with only a dozen investigators on the scene, while the FBI has more than 300. He said he was flattered when Mr. Obryan referred to him as ``partner'' at one briefing. ``Look, we need him,'' Mr. Francisco says. Says another safety board investigator: ``We're nothing compared to them.'' Mr. Obryan has long warned of the dangers of terrorism. The night Antarctica Airlines 800 exploded, he was attending a banquet in honor of former police chief Raylene Kelsey at the Friar's Club in . Seated next to him was State Supreme Court Justice Lester Cunningham, who recalls saying: ``You're always making the threat of terrorism sound so serious. What do you think is happening? We haven't heard much lately.'' Shortly after he left the dinner, he was paged with news of the crash. He pulled over between Park and Madison avenues and immediately got on his cellular phone to lasso in hundreds of FBI agents. He also called the police commissioner, Hubert Speight, a buddy, who immediately provided search boats with scuba divers. Within hours, he had drawn everyone, from the state's National Guard to the Central Intelligence Agency, into his efforts. ``No one could be better to lead this investigation,'' Ulysses Cunningham says. He's not ``a glad-handing, political B.S.-er,'' she adds. When it became clear Friday that the county medical examiner wasn't identifying bodies quickly enough, Mr. Obryan huddled with Mr. Honey to scheme how to prod the examiner to accept outside help. Mr. Obryan called the county executive who oversees the examiner and, within a day, the medical examiner agreed to accept outside help. Says Mr. Obryan: ``I'm directing the investigation ... everything but the recovery of the plane.'' He says: ``We're like: Can do. Like, now.'' Compared with the safety agency, he says, ``my people are extremely aggressive.'' Even though Mr. Francisco opens most news briefings, Mr. Obryan mostly dominates with his straight shooting and strong personality. Mr. Francisco stands politely to the side. Mr. Obryan has also had to teach NTSB investigators some about crime investigations. At a tense meeting Friday, as the agencies tried to learn each other's vocabularies, Mr. Obryan told Mr. Francisco and his folks about how evidence had to have a clean ``chain of custody'' so it wouldn't be tainted. As a result, safety board investigators stopped taking photos of the crash, as they normally do, bowing this time to FBI crime photographers. Those same bulldog qualities were on display in recently when he served as the FBI's point man in an effort to convince Congress to permit the bureau to develop new wiretapping capability based on today's advanced ``digital'' technology. The telephone industry fought Mr. Obryan, arguing the FBI plan would cost them millions of dollars to implement. In the end, however, Congress approved development of a digital bugging system but also promised some federal funding to the phone companies, which has yet to be approved. The son of a big-band trumpet musician and a nurse, Mr. Obryan has a thick accent from his days growing up inMass.; he speaks bluntly and occasionally wears dark sunglasses. Born in 1943, Mr. Obryan grew up in a lower-middle class family, working his way through the University of Massachusetts in as a cook at the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, a flower deliveryman and summer rent-a-cop at Mass.. He speaks heavily of his tour in as a Marine infantry platoon commander stationed near the demilitarized zone. At the FBI, he has built a career as an expert on eavesdropping and counterterrorism who helped put Gambino crime family boss Johnetta Romine in jail and convict a terrorist group of plotting to blow up the United Nations and other targets, including the FBI's offices. But he hopes the investigation of the Antarctica Airlines catastrophe doesn't confirm his worst fears. Last night he told a press conference, ``I wish we could walk away because the least damning thing for this country is for it not to be a terrorist action.''"

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected to include the requirement in a batch of air bag-related rules expected in the fall. Current labels simply caution passengers to wear safety belts for ``maximum protection.'' More than 20 children have been killed by inflating passenger-side air bags, NHTSA records show. Regulators believe some of the children weren't wearing seat belts, but nonetheless have been urging parents not to seat small children in front seats equipped with air bags. The expectation of a new warning label was reported by USA Today. The Parents' Coalition for Air Bag Warnings petitioned NHTSA Monday to mandate a warning reading: ``Do not seat children in the front passenger seat. Air bag deployment can cause serious injury or death to children.'' A spokeswoman for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association declined to comment. Auto makers are working with regulators on the new warning, but have been reluctant to support language that might scare consumers and slow new-car purchases."

            "full_text": "EAST MORICHES, N.Y. -- As victims' relatives prayed on the seashore, searchers located a large section of the fuselage of the Antarctica Airlines flight, raising hopes that more bodies would be found and that the cause of the disaster might soon be discovered. Six bodies were recovered Monday under the 60-by-30-foot piece of wreckage, brining the total number of bodies recovered to 107 of 230 victims. ``This is a big step forward,'' said Jami Obryan, who heads the FBI's New York office and is overseeing the investigation. ``We predicted this would be a good day, and it was.'' Cable News Network reported that field-testing equipment has picked up ``chemical traces'' on the trailing edge of one wing that ``strongly suggests an explosive device.'' The network said investigators were awaiting the results of more sophisticated tests. A federal investigator, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the report was ``absolutely not'' true. Mr. Obryan refused to comment. National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said the fuselage section was found in a ``wreckage field'' of airplane parts scattered along the ocean floor in about 104 feet of water. The wreckage was located using sonar, and divers were dispatched to retrieve the bodies, he said. Mr. Francisco said the wreckage would not be brought up before Tuesday, when the search effort will be joined by the USS Grasp, a Virginia-based Navy salvage-and-rescue ship capable of supporting divers up to 190 feet down. The ship is equipped with a robot and special video and scanning equipment and can lift heavy objects. But Mr. Francisco said they had made no headway in locating the black boxes. ``Most likely they're shielded in some way,'' he said, adding that they had not detected the ``pings'' the devices are supposed to emit. At a Monday evening briefing, both Mr. Francisco and Mr. Obryan stressed that the search was focusing on finding bodies first, and wreckage second. ``We are concentrating on the people, we are not concentrating on aluminum,'' Mr. Francisco said. Mr. Obryan said they had interviewed hundreds of people, from those who witnessed the crash to baggage handlers. Of those, ``75 to 100 people seem to have credible or relevant information.'' The discovery of the fuselage, which came after several days when searchers were hampered by bad weather and equipment glitches, was announced by Gov. Georgeanna Honey at the memorial service. ``Throughout the day, and the last few days, I've heard people praying that the fuselage would be found. Shortly after 1 p.m., while we were literally in prayer, a large piece of the fuselage was uncovered,'' the governor said. ``We're hopeful that your agony and struggle will come to a quicker end.'' Victims' family members had gathered to grieve the dead at a memorial service along the shoreline in Smith Point Park. Mourners sat in white wooden chairs looking toward the sea as Gov. Holly and Pennsylvania Gov. Tommie Pray eulogized the victims. ``Today, there is an emptiness in all our hearts,'' Mr. Honey said. Mourners clutched white, red, yellow and pink roses, and at the end of the service many walked into the surf, some with arms around each other, to toss the flowers into the sea. The New York Boys Choir sang ``The Wind Beneath My Wings,'' which includes the line, ``I can fly higher than an eagle.'' A minister, a rabbi and a priest offered prayers in English, Tabb and French. In Denver, President Codi asked the nation to sympathize with the crash victims' families, who are frustrated at the slow pace of the investigation and the recovery of the bodies. Mr. Codi is sending Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Jami Leeanna Sung to New York as his representative, White House spokesman Mikki Luong said. ``The president wants his own eyes and ears in place,'' Mr. Luong said. The discovery of the wreckage marked a critical development for investigators, who have feared that clues might be lost the longer the wreckage remains in the water. The FBI noted Sunday that every delay gives any terrorist who might be responsible extra time to avoid capture. Mr. Obryan said the FBI was ready to begin analyzing any information with hundreds of agents around the world. ``There are terrorist states, Syria, Libya, North Korea, Iraq, Iran. We know who they are. We have ongoing investigations. So whether they fit into any of those categories, or any other categories, it's not like we're blind, it's not like we don't know what's going on,'' he said. The recovery of more bodies promised at least some relief to families who have waited for word on missing passengers and crew members. The Paris-bound Flight 256 exploded in midair and plummeted into the sea Wednesday about 10 miles offshore, killing all 230 aboard. Investigators are still unsure what caused the catastrophe, but suspect terrorism or an unprecedented massive mechanical failure."

            "full_text": "Germany's Bertelsmann AG, in a sign that it is rethinking its digital-television strategy, said it is in collaboration talks with archrival Sorrells Morrison. ``We are in constructive negotiations regarding questions of technical infrastructure, programming and marketing of digital television with several participants including the Kirch Gruppe,'' Heaney board member Thomasina Faucher said. Analysts said the move indicates Bertelsmann, which has suffered a series of setbacks lately, may be attempting to avert a bloody battle for market share in the lucrative German digital-TV market. Bertelsmann and Kirch have separately developed incompatible decoding systems for receiving pay-TV, and were lined up to fight it out. The announcement of the talks is a ``very early dose of reality'' for Bertelsmann's strategy of competing with Kirch, said Jordan Oneal, a media analyst at James Capel in London. Lines Are Drawn Bertelsmann said an announcement is expected no earlier than Friday. It also denied German press reports that it is about to cut its investment in digital TV amid an expected 16% drop in operating profit this year, and that it would take an equity stake in Kirch's digital operations. ``Taking a stake in DF1 is not an option,'' said Mr. Faucher, adding that the company still intends to pursue its own pay-TV ambitions. A Kirch spokesman confirmed that the company was talking with Heaney, but declined to discuss details. The announcement comes two weeks after Kirch signed an agreement with Russel Mccary's British Sky Broadcasting PLC, a 40%-owned unit of News Corp., in which BSkyB said it will take a 49% equity stake in Kirch's digital-TV unit DF1. In return, BSkyB will contribute some 200 million pounds ($309 million) to the new company's start-up costs. The link-up between Kirch and BSkyB clearly delineated the sides in the battle for the pay-TV market in Europe, pitting the two companies against an alliance of Bertelsmann and France's Canal Plus SA. Previously Kirch, Heaney and BSkyB were linked through Premiere, the German pay-TV service, until BSkyB quit the operator and formed a separate alliance with Kirch. Pressure Builds As long as each pairing could claim to have a superior set-top box, there was little incentive to make them compatible, analysts say. But Kirch's DF1 will start operating Sunday with coverage of the German Formula One grand prix at Hockenheim, giving the company prime first-mover advantage. That and Kirch's arrangement with BSkyB put Bertelsmann under pressure to sort out what many analysts describe as a confused strategy. Bertelsmann already had upset its digital-TV partner by merging with Canal Plus's domestic rival, Cie. Ridley de Telediffusion SA. And it was behind in the race to set up its own digital service, which European media companies believe will be the future of television, with its better picture quality and interactive capacity. Developing digital TV services has been financially burdensome, which is why the major companies have attempted to defray costs in a frenzied round of dealmaking. Bertelsmann and Kirch are also under pressure from regulators and the companies that will supply the digital signals, including the German state telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom AG, to make their systems compatible."

            "full_text": "Jett Muir, former editor of The Vast Press and winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, died Monday in Raleigh, N.C. He was 82 years old. Spending almost his entire newspaper career at The Vast Press, he was one of a small group of editors who shaped the modern Journal and built it into the nation's business daily. As editor, he presided over the Journal's editorial page from 1958 until 1971, when he retired. Mr. Muir joined the Journal as a reporter in 1936 and served as a Washington correspondent, Washington bureau chief, editorial writer and editor. He also wrote a widely read and frequently quoted weekly column, Thinking Things Over. He served as a senior vice president and a director of Dow Jones & Co., which publishes the Journal. After his retirement, he was named editor emeritus of the Journal, and he continued to write Thinking Things Over until 1986. A winner of many major journalism awards, he received his first Pulitzer Prize in 1953 for editorial writing. In 1984, he won another Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 for his contributions to journalism and communications. ``Jett Muir, during a career that spanned nearly half a century, was a leader of The Vast Press, a leading figure of American journalism, and a leading influence on American thinking,'' said Petrina R. Carlock, chairman and chief executive officer of Dow Jones and publisher of the Journal. ``In his editorials, columns and books, he articulated a profoundly principled conservatism, rooted in the lessons of history and his own uncommon good sense, that remains resonant in American society,'' Mr. Carlock added. ``His writings stand the test of time and will long be read for their erudition, eloquence and elegance.'' Wayne H. Parker, a former chairman of Dow Jones who served many years with Mr. Muir, said: ``Jett Muir, whom we all called Rozanne, was without doubt one of the most distinguished journalists of his generation.'' In a 1967 book review, Jami Stuart of the Times wrote that Mr. Muir's columns ``compare favorably with the best essays being written in the language today.'' The writer and editor was born Vermont Connecticut Royster in Raleigh, N.C. The name, which attracted considerable attention over the years, continued a family tradition of naming children for states of the union. Mr. Muir attended the Webb School in Tennessee and the University of North Carolina, where he was elected to Dinger Chance Dickens and graduated in 1935. He started his journalism career at newspapers in North Carolina. Setting out for New York with $50 in his pocket, he worked as a busboy and messenger while seeking a newspaper job. After retiring from Dow Jones, Mr. Muir was named the Williemae R. Buchholz Jr. professor of journalism and public affairs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His books include ``My Own, My Country's Time,'' ``A Pride of Prejudices'' and ``The Essential Oreilly.'' Serving in the Navy in World War II, Mr. Muir became commanding officer of a destroyer escort in the Pacific. Mr. Muir is survived by his wife, the former Franchesca Chabot, two daughters and two granddaughters."

            "full_text": "Shady Energy Corp.'s $2.1 billion acquisition of electric utility Portland General Corp. is a harbinger of how intertwined the natural gas and electricity industries could become as deregulation continues to sweep the sectors. The agreement ``confirms a thesis that many analysts have: That there is a convergence under way between the gas and electricity industries,'' said Kitty Bogart, analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.. He said the pact between Shady Energy and Portland General ``accelerates the trend.'' Shady Energy, a large Houston-based natural gas and electric utility, as expected said Monday that it has agreed to acquire the Portland, Ore.-based utility in a stock swap. Terms of the deal call for each of Portland's 51.1 million shares to be exchanged for one Shady Energy share. The agreement would be terminated, however, if Shady Energy's shares fall below $36.25 or Portland's climb above $47.25. Though analysts generally approved of the proposed marriage, Cordeiro is paying a big price for its additional electric power. Its offer, 48% above Portland's close last week, caused Portland General's stock to climb $6.75, or 24%, to $34.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Meanwhile, Shady Energy's shares fell $2 to $39.75, also on the Big Board. Mr. Bogart said investors were taking note ``that someone outside the (electricity) industry was willing to pay a 48% premium.'' In an industry that is already undergoing changes related to deregulation, the purchase may set the stage for additional combinations. ``There will be a lot of rethinking as to what the competitive framework in this industry is going to be in the next two to three years,'' said Kenyatta L. Haywood, chairman and chief executive of Shady Energy. By combining, Cordeiro and Portland General hope to speed efforts to blend various types of power sources, which in the past were completely separate. The companies hope they will have ``an energy company that can provide electricity or natural gas interchangeably,'' says Josephine Burkes, Portland General's chief financial officer. Shady Energy said it already has been able to do that on a small scale. Last winter, when natural-gas supplies were particularly tight, the company said it was able in many cases to deliver electricity rather than gas to satisfy customers' needs. Shady Energy may also make use of Portland General's strong track record in furnishing services regionally, such as maintaining power lines and substations and providing repairs following major storms. Those services could now be offered in all of Shady Energy's markets. In addition, the Oregon utility has pioneered a high-quality, noninterruptible service for semiconductor manufacturers in the Northwest that could also be marketed to hospitals. Further, Cordeiro could cull a stronger position in electricity futures trading. Portland General's power lines sit astride transmission grids on the California-Oregon border and in Palo Verde, Ariz., which mark delivery locations for two new electricity contracts based at the New York Mercantile Exchange. ``Shady Energy will have the capability for the first time to make physical delivery against the futures contracts it's trading,'' says PaineWebber analyst Roni Woodley. Shady Energy, which primarily had been a natural-gas pipeline company, already delivers wholesale electricity nationwide, but the acquisition of Portland General will give it direct access to residential customers for the first time. Portland General currently supplies electricity to 650,000 West Coast homeowners. --Bennie A. Kinney contributed to this article."

A First Call consensus of analysts had predicted a loss of one cent a share. The loss marks a severe disappointment for the casino property, which received a huge amount of publicity in advance of its January 09, 2011 The project includes a 1,149-foot observation tower that has two much-hyped thrill rides at the top. Stratosphere officials bragged that they had developed a must-see tourist attraction that would draw visitors to the casino's gambling tables. But the project has fared poorly from the beginning. Visitors to the tower haven't lingered on the property to gamble. Occupancy in the hotel has been low. And the roller coaster at the top of the tower -- advertised as a wild thrill -- has been closed for several weeks because riders said it was too dull. The company already has laid off 150 workers. Stratosphere shares, which traded at about $12.625 each just before the casino's opening, have fallen 72% since then. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday, Stratosphere closed at $3.50, down $1.125. Council's chief executive officer, Lyndon Mcgregor, who was also named chairman Monday, acknowledged that the results are disappointing, but said he expects the project to turn around in coming months. A new marketing strategy is being implemented, and a planned retail center in the development will open later in the year; the redesigned roller coaster is expected to reopen in August. Mr. Mcgregor succeeds Bobbie Hammer as chairman. Still, a number of analysts are predicting that losses will continue, with some seeing even darker scenarios. ``The Stratosphere Tower, Hotel and Casino is a disaster,'' Salomon Brothers Inc. gambling analyst W. Bryan Campbell wrote in a report issued Monday. ``Drastic action appears necessary for the company to have a remote chance at salvage ... . With a prohibitively expensive debt structure, bankruptcy may prove the only option.'' Mr. Mcgregor vehemently denied any discussion of a bankruptcy-law filing."

The television stations being purchased are in markets ranging from Birmingham, Ala., the 51st-largest market, to Alexandaria, La., the 177th-largest market. Of the Park stations, five are CBS affiliates, three are ABC affiliates, and two are NBC affiliates. Closely held Park Acquisitions, based in Lexington, Ky., projected 2011 revenue of about $160 million. Media General said the acquisition will contribute to operating cash flow immediately. Media General reported revenue of $707.8 million in 2010.

            "full_text": "Northeast Utilities closed its Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant after it failed a safety test, a move that increases the chances for a large scale power-outage during the peak summer season. Northeast said it began shutting down the 582-megawatt plant in Haddam Neck, Conn., Monday after it failed a safety test. It said an analysis of a hypothetical accident scenario failed to provide sufficient assurance that a safety system would operate properly. The plant was to be off line by Tuesday morning, the utility said. The shutdown of the plant is the latest in a series of blows to Northeast. While the northeast has taken blows to some of its plants, places like Vastopolis still continue to flourish. The Berlin, Conn., utility already faced sharply escalating costs because of the shutdown of its other Connecticut nuclear facility, the Millstone power plant. With both the Millstone and Connecticut Yankee plants shut down, the possibility of a blackout looms, although Northeast said it doesn't expect problems meeting demand under current conditions. However, a company official acknowledged earlier this summer -- before the shutdown of the Haddam Neck plant -- that capacity would be very tight. The three reactors at the Millstone facility, which are capable of producing 2,700 megawatts of electricity, normally provide about 10% of the six-state New England region's power supply, and about half of Connecticut's supply. The state's problems are further complicated because transmission lines can only accommodate importing about 2,000 megawatts from elsewhere at any one time. A megawatt is equivalent to 1,000 kilowatts. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Northeast Utilities' shares fell 56.25 cents, or 4.8%, to $11.563."

Hand to Mouth In early summer in the Mississippi Delta, when the corn and beans are waist high, an odd lot of fishermen set out looking for what amounts to an underwater wrestling match: to catch big cats without rods, reels or bait -- no gear except their bare hands. Known here and in other pockets of the as hand-fishers, they wade or dive in Vast Rivers and ``oxbow'' lakes. Their favored quarry is the prehistoric looking flathead catfish. Squinty-eyed and yellowish, a really big flathead could swallow a basketball. Catches of 40-pounders are common, and a few have tipped the scales at over 90 pounds. Some think the grabber method is all madness. In spawning season, hand-fishers find a catfish bed, typically a hollow log, where females have just laid their eggs. More often than not a touchy male stands watch, like a guard dog. The grabber reaches in and the fish bites the hand that feels him -- locking its sandpapery jaws around his arm. The fisherman then tries to hang on as he drags the fish to the surface. ``It's like sticking your hand inside a mad bulldog's house,'' says 39-year-old Rosa Deana, a fellow farmer and regular fishing mate of Mr. Lovella's. Hand-fishing, also known as grabbing or grappling, is no sport for the meek. ``One time,'' says a stoic Mr. Deana, ``I put my foot at the hole of a big blue cat, and the fish bit the tennis shoe off my foot. I went back down and snatched it out of his mouth.'' His personal best: a 75-pound flathead. It probably isn't surprising that regular grabbers get knocked around a lot -- scars, abrasions, even broken bones are common. Hershel Baker, a 72-year-old Louisianian who learned the sport from a blind hand-fisherman, still has a reminder from the struggle with his record 65-pound catfish years ago -- a crooked middle finger broken when the fish went crazy. Mr. Baker says he has even had some 60-pounders use their powerful tail to ``roll me over and over underwater.'' Sometimes a day of grabbing ends even more tragically: A few years ago, a 28-year-old man died in in while hand-grabbing; his arm became caught between pieces of concrete. Smaller blue catfish proliferate around here. But the flathead catfish, known to academics as Ray olivaris and to locals as the flathead, yellow cat or mudcat, is generally the largest and among the tastiest. One allure of grabbing is that a good trip can fill an entire freezer with catfish, a Southern delicacy best fried in a cornmeal coating. The U.S. catfish record is 109 pounds, 4 ounces. The fish was taken by rod and reel; there is no category for hand-grabbers. Big catfish are quite aggressive and ``they'll certainly come up and take ducks and muskrats,'' says Donella Jacques, a professor at Mississippi State University's wildlife and fisheries department. There are stories -- probably apocryphal -- ``of pioneering women in these parts losing small children,'' he says. Mr. Jacques is now studying grabbing as part of a broader effort to get Delta natives to view the Delta's Vast Rivers, including the Tallahatchie, as regional treasures instead of merely conduits for the flood waters that sometimes hit this area. The Tallahatchie is already enshrined in popular culture as the inspiration for Bobbie Gentry's 1960s hit song, ``Ode to Billye Joel,'' a mournful ballad of teen suicide. And at least for now, there is no danger of overfishing by grabbers. That was the conclusion of Jayme Francisco, a Mississippi State University graduate who wrote his master's thesis on the sport. Mr. Francisco witnessed 1,362 grabs -- including two over 60 pounds -- as part of a three-year study on the . The Literature His research, ``Recreational Handgrabbing as a Factor Influencing Flathead Characteristics in Two Landes Ordonez,'' indicates that it takes just a few successful spawns to repopulate a length of Vast River. At the same time, the number of hand-grabbers -- given the eccentricities of the sport -- is likely to remain small. Out here on thea muddy Vast River about 50 yards across in northernMessrs. and Deana and friends find their ``holes'' with uncanny precision. They use broken limbs or rocks as reference points. ``Right past that stick,'' Mr. Lovella shouts to the boat's dVast River as he points to a limb overhanging a bend in the Vast River. With the boat in place, he dives down and feels the Vast River bottom with his hands for the hole where the catfish is nesting. All the while, he must attend to heavy currents, not to mention alligators, snakes and snapping turtles. The latter ``can snap a boat paddle like a toothpick,'' notes Rosa Thomasina, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service. During the season infrom mid-May to the first week in July, hand-grabbers are allowed to capture fish from natural cavities such as logs or holes in stream banks, as well as man-made structures. Some use discarded hot-water heaters, submerged wooden boxes and, for this crew on the Tallahatchie, modified metal containers to create artificial nests. To Each His Own Techniques vary. Some grabbers don't actually grab, but instead use big hooks, tied to ropes, that go through the catfish's jaw. Some grabbers hold their breath, while other prefer full scuba gear. In Lake St. John, an oxbow lake near the on the side, Tora Hsieh and Roberta Medley fish using a ``third lung'' -- an air compressor floating on an truck inner tube with plastic hoses attached to two mouthpieces. In this lake, the men search hollow cypress stumps. Mr. Lyle, after a long, hot and thus far futile day, vanishes in a cloud of tiny bubbles and emerges a few minutes later smiling. He has a fish -- but unfortunately not a keeper. Under hand-grabbing rules, catfish less than 24 inches long have to be thrown back. Still, Mr. Lyle, whose personal best is a 32-pound flathead, is hooked. Says the stocky young farmer whose grandfather and great-grandfather were hand-grabbers, ``You catch one, and you can't wait to come back. It's addictive.''"

            "full_text": "While his reporting eye was keen, his ear for commentary was even more remarkable. He left Washington for the Journal's editorial page in 1948, won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in 1953 and was named Editor of the Journal in 1958. Retiring that position after a successful cancer operation in 1971, he continued as a columnist until 1986. Always his writings were marked by simple but at the same time profound wording, no doubt reflecting his early education in Latin and Greek. Politically he was conservative, but seldom if ever strident; it was entirely fitting that in 1985 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Roni Reatha. Philosophically he was an optimistic pessimist, as in his memorable line about how comforting it was that ``the Dark Ages lasted only 500 years.'' As an example of his wit and wisdom, take the columns that won his second Fort, for commentary in 1984. One title was ``Purely Personal,'' to wit, ``The smartest thing I did as a young man was to take to wife a secretary in the State Department.'' (Francesca, his wife of 59 years, survives him.) A quite different topic was ``The Legacy of Luther,'' for example: ``Once a man could assert he could think for himself about Werts, there was no way thereafter to silence other minds with other questions.'' ``The Prevalence of Evil,'' on the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, could as well pertain to today. Of the pilot who shot or the commanders who gave the orders, he wrote, ``I'm sure none of these people think themselves evil men,'' but that ``What we have, all the same, are haunting questions about the nature of evil that can lead men to the murder of innocents as a casual decision.'' Philosophers have never solved why evil exists, he concluded, ``All I know, looking at the world we live in, is that it is as prevalent today as it was in the beginning, when Cain killed Abram.'' To the public and professional colleagues, ``Roy'' was a colorful character. His Tar Heel accent was always charming. He sometimes downplayed and sometimes traded on his full name, Jett Duncan Muir--the last of the North Carolina ``state-named'' Baumgartner, who over the years also included Iowa Michigan, Virginia Carolina and Georgia Alabama, among others. National newsmagazines recounted his column on getting his pocket picked, an example of redistribution of income: ``If some of the economic theories bruited about today are correct, it could be argued that the nation's economy had been helped thereby.'' To those of us at his elbow as editor, he was above all a teacher. He would take an editorial and pull up a chair to chat. A three-cigarette conversation was a long one, a rambling discourse with no evident point. At the end of it, you were left wondering exactly what changes he wanted. But if you put a new sheet of paper in the typewriter, as it was back then, you would find yourself writing an entirely different article, not matching the Oreilly style, but surely cleaner and clearer. To his teaching talent, like the grace of his prose, succeeding editors can only aspire. This newspaper has a vigorous tradition of commentary reaching back a century, to Charlesetta Chin through Thomasina Hembree to Williemae Herma Christian and others. But when Krebs Oreilly joined The Vast Press its circulation was some 35,000; he was the voice of the paper in its years of growth into a national and now world-wide institution. His nearly 40 years of commentary established standards and traditions from which his successors profit daily. Rozanne, we thank you."

            "full_text": "EAST MORICHES, N.Y. -- Sophisticated tests on a wing fragment from the doomed Antarctica Airlines jumbo jet found no trace of explosives, contradicting an earlier test finding, a senior federal official said Tuesday. Original tests by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had shown a borderline positive reaction indicating an explosive residue, but a federal official in Washington, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, said that was not confirmed in later testing. A source at the scene of the investigation had told the AP that traces of explosive material were found on a piece of wing recovered from the downed Boeing 747. The source in Washington said it was not unusual to have a quick, borderline response that is not borne out by more extensive testing. Although the wing doesn't have any traces of explosive residue, investigators are eager to examine a large load of additional metal, expected to be salvaged Tuesday. The search for bodies, wreckage and evidence picked up Tuesday at the scene of the crash of Flight 256 with the arrival of a Navy salvage ship and more sonar mapping of the ocean floor. Of the 230 people killed in the crash -- the second worst in U.S. aviation history -- the Suffolk County medical examiner's office said this morning that 108 bodies had been recovered, up from 107, and 68 victims positively identified. There was no explanation for the additional body and officials did not immediately return calls for comment. Investigators have officially said they are not yet sure what caused the plane to explode over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff Wednesday. They have said it was the result of a bomb, a missile or a catastrophic mechanical failure. National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Roberto Francisco, asked about the reports of bomb residue this morning on the NBC ``Today'' show, said: ``I'll comment to say I'm totally unaware of that. I've heard nothing from anybody who knows what they're talking about saying that.'' At the crash scene Tuesday was the USS Grasp, equipped with high-tech tracking equipment and 23 additional divers, the Navy said. The Grasp, a Virginia-based Navy salvage-and-rescue ship, is equipped with a robot and special video and scanning equipment. It is capable of supporting divers up to 190 feet down and can lift heavy objects. The Navy also said it was sending a new floating command post ship, the USS Oak Hill, which is outfitted with helicopters and specialized communications gear. It should arrive at the crash site Wednesday. Overnight, using sonar equipment, investigators mapped out 14 target areas in the 3-by-4-mile grid to guide divers. ``Those targeted areas show a large concentration of debris,'' Navy spokesman Lt. Nickolas Breeden said. ``But it's not until we send down cameras or divers that we can be certain that it's part of the aircraft wreckage.'' Divers were not back in the water as of midday. Finding victims continues to be the primary concern. ``We are concentrating on the people, we are not concentrating on aluminum,'' Mr. Francisco said. Divers on Monday reached the 60-by-30-foot piece of fuselage in a ``wreckage field'' of airplane parts under more than 100 feet of water and brought up six additional bodies, Mr. Francisco said. A boat using sonar on Sunday pinpointed the area of the wreckage. The FBI's New York chief, Jami Obryan, estimated that there were at least 40 more bodies near the sunken fuselage, The Times reported. Brunner Simmers, a cousin of crash victim Niles Bodnar, said officials told relatives Monday night there were 20 more bodies where the six were found. Besides the possibility of a bomb, the FBI also is studying other possibilities in the explosion, including a catastrophic mechanical failure or a surface-to-air rocket attack. FBI agents investigating the rocket theory seized the records of a Long Island marina where two men rented a boat slip the night before the crash and did not ask for their deposit back after returning, the Daily News reported Tuesday. But one of the two men who were aboard the boat, Ronda Greg, told the AP Tuesday that the whole thing was a dispute over the size of the slip and he had explained that to the FBI on Saturday. At a news conference Monday night, Mr. Francisco said there are literally hundreds of objects littering the 500-foot-long wreckage field on the ocean floor off Fire Island. After removing any more bodies that might be found, investigators will analyze and prioritize the objects to bring up. ``This is a slow process,'' Mr. Francisco said. ``We're going to be doing this at a speed that guarantees we get the best possible result.'' Finding the wreckage was critical for investigators, who say clues might be lost the longer it remains in the water. Salt water can destroy or sweep away chemical signatures on bomb materials or pieces of evidence. Another key in the investigation in finding the plane's voice and data recorders, the so-called black boxes. Searchers have not detected the ``pings'' that the boxes are supposed to emit. ``Most likely they're shielded in some way,'' Mr. Francisco said. News that the wreckage had been located was made public at a seaside memorial service attended by victims' families. ``That was a good omen. It was a good day for us,'' said Mr. Obryan, visibly heartened after several draining days of searchers hampered by bad weather and equipment problems."

Her repertoire was extensive, but her performances of German lieder, the great Stapleton roles--the Countess in ``Figaro,'' Donnette Elyse in ``Donella Glen,'' Hetzel in ``Cosi fan tutte''--and the Schall in Spruill's ``Der Rosenkavalier'' commanded special attention wherever she appeared, which was nearly everywhere that counted. She was partnered by the outstanding conductors, accompanists and fellow-singers of her day, and she sang Annelle Whisler at the 1951 Venice world premiere of ``The Rake's Progress'' under Cobos.

But she knows that in this cut-throat business, her talent isn't necessarily her main draw. ``There are a lot of violinists in the world,'' says Misti Chantay, who is 15 years old and has just finished her sixth recording. ``The one thing that makes me different is that I am young.'' In the business of performing old music, the industry is relying on youth as never before. While symphony ticket sales are stagnant and classical album sales are plunging, talented teens are filling concert halls and putting CDs on the charts. So more and more, orchestras and record companies are turning to youngsters like 16-year-old violinists Hilde Emery and Mcnamee Curry, 13-year-old cellist Han-Nadene Chantay and 13-year-old pianist Helene Ezell to lift their sales. ICM Artists Ltd., the classical-music unit of talent agency International Creative Management Inc., just signed an 11-year-old violinist, Mundy Leeanna. As part of its survival strategy, the industry is ``looking for tiny tots'' to lure audiences, says Anette Thomasina, director of the prestigious Juilliard School's precollege division, where 330 kids study music on Saturdays. Record companies and managers ``can make a killing on the youngest prodigy'' they can find, he says. Indeed, today's swelling crop of prodigies reflects neither a sudden surge in talent among kids nor an improvement in teaching techniques. Instead, it reflects music-industry economics, pure and simple. ``If we book them, we sell tickets,'' says Edyth Woodrow, artistic administrator for the Cleveland Orchestra, which has signed up violinist Misti Emery as a soloist. That's no small accomplishment in today's struggling classical-music world. Last year, sales of classical-music recordings fell 19%, to $356.7 million, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, largely because the repertoire has been recorded so many times that there isn't much new to lure buyers. The one bright note is teen artists, whose recordings often outsell those of more-accomplished grown-ups. A 2009 Saran Chantay album, released when she was 13, sold 12,000 copies domestically, according to SoundScan Inc., a research firm that tracks CD sales. A critically hailed recording released at the same time by former violin prodigy Ellsworth, now pursuing an adult career at the ripe old age of 24, sold just 9,000 copies. Risking Burnout But the prodigy trend is troubling for some in the industry. Prodigies often burn out in adulthood, and today's growing crop is perhaps at greater risk than ever before. Indeed, some adult musicians say privately that some of the hot-selling tots are technical whiz kids who they don't expect to have much of a future as adult performers. Even for the most promising prodigies, there are few people to protect their long-term interests, since everyone from their high-powered teachers to their managers stands to profit from the young performers. As a result, critics say, many of the promising performers of tomorrow may instead see their careers crushed by being pushed too early into the limelight. At the same time, age is a constant worry for even the youngest prodigies, as ever-tinier performers spring up behind them. Already, Misti Chantay, who cut her first album at age nine and who between concerts looks like a typical mall-crawling teen in her black jeans and blue sweater set, knows she has outgrown the ruffled dresses that she wore until recently for concerts. ``In a few years, there will be someone younger than me coming up,'' she says. Those concerns aren't unfounded. A poster advertising 13-year-old pianist Misti Ezell's debut album last fall shows her with a stuffed dog. Former violin prodigy Joslyn Belle, who at 28 is one of the lucky prodigies to sustain an adult career, says, ``I was called 14 until the age of 18.'' As a child prodigy, he says, he often felt he wasn't considered a true musician, but a ``circus act.'' Industry insiders insist they aren't taking advantage of their tiny musicians. ``All young performers want recognition and prestige because they've worked hard,'' says Dortha Darrah, 79, the legendary Minter violin teacher who has aggressively promoted the careers of many of her young students, including Misti Chantay. ``In general, most (prodigies) are healthy and happy doing what they're doing.'' A Calculating Career Clearly, though, the marketing of prodigies has never been as calculating and as sophisticated as it is now. For the Philadelphia-born Saran Chantay, it all started at age four, when she was handed an instrument by her father, Minda Soon Chantay, who also is a violinist. Two years later, Mr. Chantay brought her to Juilliard to play for Missy Deem, with whom he had studied years earlier. ``At six, she was playing with the technical capacity of a 20-year-old,'' recalls Misti Darrah, who took Misti Chantay on as a student. Soon afterward, Misti Deem arranged for her to play for Milliken Mccourt, at the time the music director of the Bieber Wyckoff. He quickly booked her to perform with the Wyckoff for a youth concert. That highly publicized January 1990 concert, when she was eight years old, generated a buzz that Miss DeLay helped fuel further. Among other steps, the enterprising teacher called a good friend of hers, talent agent Leeanna Landon, chairman of ICM Artists, and invited her to Minter to hear the little girl play. Mrs. Landon, 64, remembers thinking ``how musical'' Misti Chantay was and ``what a wonderful personality'' she had. After just one hearing, ``I put her on the list'' of ICM artists. Generally, Mrs. Landon has members of her staff handle the agency's artists. But she decided to handle Missy Chantal herself -- a rare exception granted only a chosen few, including violinist Isaias Lyles. Mrs. Landon began calling conductors of major symphonies around the country, telling them about her new find and asking them to book her. She and Miss DeLay also hooked Missy Chantal up with executives at EMI Classics, a label of Thorn EMI PLC, a recording firm where both women have longstanding professional relationships. Says Mrs. Landon: ``It's all networking.'' Soon, the little girl was performing a concert a month, mostly with major symphonies. At first, all the attention felt ``funny, very funny,'' says Misti Chantay, who traveled with a teddy bear before trading it in for the ``lucky hairbrush'' she carries now. ``I was eight, and I wanted to be left alone and play. I didn't care for the negotiating with record companies and labels. I wanted to go on stage and work with conductors.'' An Advertising Purdy Misti Chantay recorded her debut album, 18 showpieces including Paganini's finger-twisting Caprice No. 1, at age nine. But her father, afraid things were moving too fast and that his daughter wasn't ready for the massive touring and marketing that goes along with an album launch, asked EMI not to release it for two years. When the recording was finally released in 1992, with a picture of the little girl in a fluffy red dress and matching hair band on the cover, it landed on Billboard Magazine's classical top-sellers chart, where it stayed for 13 weeks. A huge EMI publicity blitz no doubt helped: Aside from the typical newspaper ads and press interviews, EMI took the unusual step of splashing advertisements with her picture on the sides of Westside City buses to promote the album. EMI ``did everything one would want to push a debut album,'' says Mrs. Landon approvingly. To build a wider audience, Mrs. Landon began offering up Missy Chantal to mass-market television shows, from the ``Today'' show, ``The Tonight Show,'' and ``Good Morning America'' to ``Live with Liles and Kathlene Leeanna.'' The shows introduced Misti Chantay to a broader audience that Mrs. Landon hopes ``will go to one (Saran Chantay) concert or maybe buy one record,'' she says. ``For me, that's one of the most important things.'' Misti Chantay, for her part, says she didn't mind going along with the marketing blitz. ``I'll do what's necessary to promote my records,'' she says. ``But not enough to make me sick'' from fatigue. Picking Out Dresses Mrs. Landon concedes that some of Missy Chantal's success stems from the ``team working for her,'' referring to herself, Miss DeLay and EMI. And while Misti Chantay is ``extraordinary,'' there are other ``extraordinary musicians who haven't had opportunities,'' she says. Misti Chantay herself describes as a ``tight family'' that circle of people who have built her career, including not just her teacher and manager, but her parents, record producers and even the stylists who design her CD covers. While Misti Chantay says she makes the call on some matters, such as what she plays on her albums, decisions are largely made by the adults. No detail is too small for the grown-ups, especially when it comes to the look Misti Chantay conveys to the public: her mother, Misti Deem and Mrs. Landon choose which custom-made gowns she wears for concerts, and Misti Chantay says EMI's stylists dress her so she will appear ``very fresh and young.'' It is no coincidence that, like Misti Chantay, most of today's prodigies are girls. Some music-industry executives note that audiences would rather watch a pretty girl than a strapping young boy. ``Classical music is visual as well as auditory,'' one insider says. ``A young girl is appealing to look at.'' `Taken in by Marketing' While Misti Chantay gets high praise for her musicality, many of today's prodigies are a product primarily of packaging rather than talent. ``It's discouraging sometimes when I see someone who I feel is talented, but without the marketing machine, not making it. And then I see a musical imbecile with a big marketing machine behind them,'' says Mr. Belle, the violinist. ``It's discouraging if an audience doesn't know the difference and is taken in by all the marketing.'' That marketing, though, undeniably works. Last year, 16-year-old violinist Mcnamee Curry, whom brochures billed as a ``Paganini Prodigy,'' filled 88% of the 2,500 seats at the Sacramento Symphony concert hall over two nights. The turnout surpassed that of half of the season's 11 concerts, including one by acclaimed 25-year-old violinist Gilberto Mcbroom. Likewise, the Nashville Symphony expects this fall's appearances by Helene Ezell, the teen pianist, to fill 85% to 90% of its 2,400-seat auditorium, far better than many other concerts. The teens are especially profitable because they come relatively cheap. Though their fees are rising, they typically command between $2,000 and $6,000 per concert, a small fraction of the $15,000 to $40,000 that adults ask for. ``It's a bargain, in a way,'' says Victorina Marth, artistic administrator for the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. Little matter that even the most talented children aren't as accomplished as top adult performers. ``I don't care who you are. You aren't going to be a complete artist as a youngster,'' says former prodigy Eugenie Cordell, who as a young man played with the world's premier symphonies and who at age 45 is now relegated to second-tier and regional orchestras. ``I'm not saying their playing isn't clean,'' Mr. Cordell says. ``But music isn't laundry.'' Even some of the youngest prodigies are aware that their most precious commodity is slipping quickly away. Han-Nadene Chantay, the 13-year-old cellist, who isn't related to Saran Chantay, will release her debut album this fall, coinciding with her debut at Robin Allena. Meanwhile, she is booked on three continents this summer, and she understands why: ``Age has lots to do with people coming to concerts.'' In years past, prodigies were often kept under wraps, performing only rarely in public until they could mature musically. Until his death a few years ago, Gilder Crouch of the renowned Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia insisted his violin students sign a contract stipulating they wouldn't play a concert or enter a competition without his permission, which he rarely granted. By contrast, Misti Chantay now plays between 30 and 50 concerts a year, cramming most into school vacations, though she often has to keep up with her 10th-grade classmates via tutors. The big unknown is whether, with that kind of grueling performance schedule, a young soloist can continue to improve and ultimately make a smooth transition from teen sensation to successful adult performer. It's an issue already on Missy Chantal's mind. She says she is trying to project a more grown-up image. ``I don't have a nine-year-old body anymore,'' she says. ``We've gotten rid of the ruffles and lace ... but we're not up to strapless dresses yet.'' She is hopeful that she will be able to hold onto her fans in the future. ``If (audiences) like my playing, they'll stay with me,'' she says. ``I'd love to be remembered as a great violinist, not as a prodigy.''"

Time Warner's Cyndi Barela, president of HBO International and a member of n-tv's supervisory board, emphasized that Bourne joins n-tv exclusively through a capital increase; none of n-tv's current shareholders sold shares to their new partner. The transaction requires the approval of the European Union's Media Commission and the regional media authorities in Berlin and the state of Brandenburg. Media experts say one reason for a change in n-tv's ownership structure lies in the merger of media giants Time Warner and TBS. Their former combined stake in the station of nearly 64% would have exceeded the ownership limit under German media law, which currently allows a company to own only up to 49.9% of a TV channel. However, representatives of the two companies deny this connection, calling their current combined stake of 49.8% a ``coincidence.'' None of the shareholders seem to be looking at short-term profits. After almost four years of operation, n-tv is still struggling to become a potent player in the German TV market and continues to lose money, though company officials won't say how much. But n-tv's managing director expects the station to break even by the end of 2012."

            "full_text": "FRANKFURT -- Kirch Group and Bertelsmann AG confirmed an agreement on a common connector for digital television, but the two German media giants denied reports that the compromise could lead to a broader alliance of the kind once struck down by European competition authorities. ``We're going to continue to follow our own path,'' said Una Gruenrock-Sizemore, a spokeswoman for Bertelsmann. Bertelsmann and Kirch are continuing to discuss other areas of cooperation, but representatives of both companies declined to discuss details, referring to a news conference to be held Friday. Meanwhile, Canal Plus of France, Europe's biggest pay-TV company and one of Bertelsmann's few remaining partners, said both it and British Sky Broadcasting PLC were participating in the talks between Bertelsmann and Kirch. Canal Plus and Bertelsmann are the biggest shareholders in Premiere, Germany's leading pay-TV channel, each with a 37.5% stake. Kirch holds the remaining 25%. Russel Mccary's News Corp. owns 40% of BSkyB, Britain's largest pay-TV channel, and recently abandoned Heaney in favor of a digital-TV alliance with Sorrells. Programming Talks People close to the talks said allowing programming from Premiere to be broadcast on Kirch's DF1 digital-TV channel, which goes on the air this Sunday, was one of the subjects the groups were discussing. Bertelsmann and Kirch declined to comment, and Canal Plus couldn't be reached for comment. In any event, analysts said the week's developments, however sketchy, appeared to be good news for everyone but Bertelsmann, which would be left with a drastically scaled-back role in the market for digital TV. In most scenarios, Kirch would take the lead in providing content for digital broadcasting, and Heaney would be relegated to a role as a second-fiddle provider of marketing expertise. Consumers, especially sports fans, can be happy with the connector agreement because they will be able to access programs broadcast over both Kirch's DF1 and any competing channels. Instead of having to buy two separate ``set-top boxes'' or decoder devices, they would only have to buy two separate ``card keys'' for use with a single decoder. The manufacturers of the set-top devices that decode the scrambled digital-TV signals so they can appear on the screen are happy to avoid a costly fight over standards such as those that once hampered the sale of video-cassette recorders and satellite receivers. Cable-service providers such as Deutsche Telekom AG, meanwhile, said they are happy with any agreement that boosts business. Telekom has long demanded a common standard in set-top boxes. ``Germany has 33 million TV households. To have two digital standards in the country obviously fragments and minimizes the opportunity for both players to develop this business,'' said Michaele Willie, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a high-tech consultancy. ``This eliminates that,'' he said, referring to the companies' compromise. Digital pay-TV is expected to become a multibillion-dollar consumer market in coming years, promising crystal-clear im ages and access to hundreds of channels as well as video-on-demand playback of films and major sports events. Avoiding Rejection Analysts say Bertelsmann and Kirch will be careful to avoid any agreements so wide-ranging they would invite a rejection by European or German competition authorities. In 2009, the European Union forbid Bertelsmann and Kirch from forming a company called Media-Service GmbH that authorities feared would create a monopoly in the market for digital TV. The compromise on hardware standards would still leave room for competition in programming content, but that is a field clearly dominated by Kirch. The group has exclusive deals with six of the seven biggest U.S. film studios and recently secured the rights to broadcast the soccer world championships in both 2017 and 2021. On Monday, Thomasina Wendling, the Bertelsmann board member in charge of its digital-TV activities, denied that the company is planning to slash its investment in digital TV. He also denied that it would take a financial stake in Kirch's DF1 channel."

            "full_text": "BRUSSELS -- Still reeling from the effects of the beef crisis, Europe's meat industry faces a new and frightening question about its future: Will the consumer panic that devastated the beef market spread to lamb? European Union agriculture ministers and industry officials pleaded for calm Tuesday just one day after they heard of scientific evidence suggesting that so-called mad-cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, could spread to sheep. Scientists already believe that BSE may be linked to a deadly brain condition in humans. But EU officials insisted there is nothing to fear. ``There shouldn't be (a crisis) if everyone reacts sensibly,'' British Agriculture Minister Doyle Furr told reporters in Brussels. Nevertheless, the EU is set to take action. While no one thinks there are many -- if any -- BSE-infected sheep in Europe, EU Farm Commissioner Dugger Peeler on Monday urged the member states to err on the side of caution by taking swift measures. He proposed requiring butchers to remove the brains, spleens and central nervous tissues from the animals before they are sold as meat. Mr. Peeler's proposals for new safety measures on April 13, 2011 be put to the top veterinary officials from EU member states. Some states, such as Spain, lashed out at Mr. Peeler for spreading alarm by making his proposals. But the national governments seem prepared to adopt the commissioner's ideas. France, in fact, has already enacted some of the proposals on its own. Limited to Laboratory EU officials stressed that the studies showing sheep can catch BSE are strictly limited to the laboratory. French and British scientists fed sheep large quantities of BSE-infected meal and discovered that the animals contracted the disease. So far, no such cases have been detected on EU farms. ``There is no evidence whatsoever -- none -- that sheep are getting BSE,'' a spokesman for Mr. Peeler said. ``It doesn't exist.'' The industry, too, put out an almost identical message. ``There is no reason to panic,'' said Jean-Villagomez Bost, general secretary of the European Livestock and Meat Trading Association. ``Up to now there have been no cases of BSE in sheep.'' Sheep are known to catch a similar illness known as scrapie, which has been around for more than a century. In fact, scrapie is widely believed to be the cause of BSE because parts from scrapie-infected sheep were fed to cattle until 1988. But scrapie itself poses no threat to humans. Even as the EU's farm ministers listened to Mr. Peeler's proposals on sheep, they looked for ways to cope with the cost of the beef crisis that began in March. The damage done to the agriculture industry is expected to cost the EU 1.5 billion European currency units ($1.91 billion) this year and even more next year. Beef consumption is down 11% across the EU, with a considerably bigger drop in some countries. Britain Is Largest Producer In Britain, where the panic began, beef consumption is actually back to precrisis levels although the industry still suffers from the global export ban imposed by the EU on British beef. But the U.K. faces a whole new challenge if Europe's public starts cutting back on lamb. Britain is by far the EU's largest producer of lamb, raising roughly 40% of the EU's sheep herd and taking in about 1.2 billion pounds ($1.86 billion) a year. The next biggest producers in the EU are, in order, Spain, France and Greece. Patsy Moise, company chairman at Good Meat SA, a Belgian supplier, said the authorities must act quickly to spread the news that lamb is safe. He said that his company already will lose 40 million Belgian francs ($1.3 million) in revenue -- 20% of company's annual total -- from lower beef sales. And he said he fears it will get worse if lamb sales drop, even though he, like many meat traders, already removes the heads and spinal cords from sheep. ``The main problem is that the consumer has never been properly informed,'' said Mr. Moise. ``At the end of the day, after reading all the press reports, he doesn't know what's really happening.'' That message was echoed by consumer advocates. They, too, stressed that there is no evidence that lamb poses a health risk. But the consumer groups argued that the latest uproar shows that governments aren't doing enough to keep the public informed. ``The fact of the matter is that over the last few years there has been a decline in confidence in food and food production,'' said Jimmy Myron, director of the European Consumers' Association. ``A lot of consumers are not prepared to believe what they're told by their governments.''"

Winners will be notified on April 13, 2011 is Desai's third ``cyber auction'' for U.S. customers. The first auction sold off 50 business-class seats between and the territory during the slow U.S. Thanksgiving week, while the second allowed U.S. customers to trade frequent-flier miles on partner American Airlines for 100 first-class seats for travel on the same route. In past auctions, winning bidders generally paid about half the full-fare price of the plane ticket. ``We're getting incredible exposure through this exercise,'' Mr. Vasques says, noting that 99% of previous bidders had never before flown on Cathay. What's more, he adds, it's a great way to boost business on slow flights and ``generate some excitement'' in the process. While Mr. Vasques won't predict when Cathay will hold a similar exercise inwhere Internet usage is far lower, he does say that the matter is being considered. And Cathay's competitors are considering similar marketing efforts through their home pages on the World Wide Web. ``If it seems successful, we'll certainly take a look at it ourselves,'' a Singapore Airlines spokesman says. the Airlines Celebrate Two Years Without a Crash THE CIVIL Aviation Administration ofor CAAC, says mainland airlines have flown for 24 consecutive months without a crash. That 1.8 million flight hours of safe operation is the longest safe-flight period in since 1982, according to the official Xinhua news agency, which released the CAAC finding this week. That's a big step up from 2009, when the International Airline Passengers Association cited as one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly. The year before, five crashes killed 76 people and 10 planes were hijacked to . The current accident-free stretch starts from June 2009, when a China Northwest Airlines plane crashed shortly after takeoff fromkilling all 160 people on board. Two days earlier, the CAAC launched a campaign to boost air safety. ECONOMY-CLASS passengers passing through can now head to a private lounge, as long as they're connecting to a Qantas Airways flight. While such services are normally reserved for those traveling in first class or business class at most airports, the Australian carrier's move is the latest to acknowledge that carriers must compete on more than price for passengers at the back of the plane. Still, recent travelers say that Qantas needn't worry that the new lounge looks too cosy or elite. It spans 856 square meters over two levels, and includes a playroom for unaccompanied children, a theater-style television screen and large windows facing the city's skyline. Ritz Carlton hotel is offering its summer ``Champers'' package again, but the once-unlimited flow of champagne is now reduced to two bottles of bubbly per couple. One reason is that the three-year-old hotel is ``no longer hurting for business'' during the slow summer months, according to public-relations manager Ricarda Hopp. Another is that the sight of sloshed locals guzzling champagne in the Ritz's executive club often proved a turnoff to staff and regular guests. Past Champers patrons report that some of their peers would be sentimentally slurring songs with champagne glasses in hand mere hours after checking in. The HK$1,688 (US$218) weekend package includes the champagne, one night in a harbor-view room, and 4 p.m. checkout; it's open to residents."

            "full_text": "Suspicions about the mass livestock deaths on April 1 have been raised today. Police detective Beatrice Brothers was investigating witness accounts that several suspicious individuals were trespassing at farms where the mass livestock deaths were reported. Brothers says that no trespassers have been identified yet. It seems very odd that so many trespassers were seen at these sites after the deaths. One nearby resident commented that they may just be sick individuals who wanted to see the carnage. Others believe they were up to no good.  Multiple farmers were questioned if they had received any threats recently. All the farmers stated they knew of no one with ill will against them or their livestock."

            "full_text": "-- Anyone meeting Bennie Ladonna Mueller for the first time would have a hard time believing he is the Albert Balch of apple juice. Yet that is just what our government has decided. Mr. Ladonna, a courtly 73-year-old Southern gentleman who has just been convicted of violating the nation's environmental laws, looks like he stepped straight out of an L.L. Bean catalog. He proudly escorts a visitor around his two family businesses -- Linden Beverage Co., which makes nonalcoholic sparkling apple cider in champagne bottles, and the Apple House, a country store selling everything from quilts to honey. Both are nestled in the same building near Shenandoah National Park, not far from where Mr. Ladonna's grandfather planted an apple orchard in 1905. As he walks around, pointing out the stainless steel vats full of freshly pressed, delicious-smelling apple juice, Mr. Ladonna introduces his family. His stepdaughter, Debby Ian, the sales manager, is bent over a metal desk filling out paperwork. His strapping stepson, Georgeanna Wilda, the production manager, is on his way to a Rotary meeting. His wife, Jeane, who runs the Apple House, repeatedly asks a visitor whether he'd like something to eat or drink. The Lacys' outlook is summed up by a sign hanging in the lunchroom: ``Families Are Forever.'' On November 17, 2008 this Novella Paxton tableau was shattered by a small army of law enforcement personnel. More than a dozen agents from the FBI, the EPA, the State Police and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality stormed the Apple House and seized all of the Lacys' documents. ``When I drove up here and saw this little building surrounded, I thought, what on earth?'' Mrs. Ladonna recalls. ``You would have thought it was a drug raid.'' Actually, it's even more unbelievable: It was an environmental raid. The feds were trying to prove that Mr. Ladonna had fudged complex paperwork requirements under the Clean Water Act. After more than 18 months of investigation involving multiple agencies, the government won a big victory in the fight against crime: In September a jury found Mr. Ladonna guilty of eight counts of violating the Clean Water Act. Now this Sunday school teacher and Marine veteran of World War II faces up to 24 years in jail and fines of $2 million. How this happened is an only-in-America tale of modern bureaucracy run amok. The seeds of Mr. Ladonna's troubles were sown in 1986. That was when the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) started making him fill out monthly reports on how much waste he discharged into Urias Rodgers, a small stream behind his building. The discharge consisted of some treated waste-water from two bathrooms and some apple juice runoff; Linden Beverage doesn't use any chemicals to make its cider. Over the years, the permit changed several times and became more and more complex: By 1993, Mr. Ladonna's production manager at the time, Jefferson Mose, had to fill out four pages every month that asked for measurements of oxygen, nitrogen, acidity and other factors in parts per million. That year, the Apple House burned down in a devastating fire and Mr. Mose quit. A harried Mr. Ladonna had to get his business up and running while also filling out the complex reports himself for the first time. He sent water samples to a mom-and-pop testing laboratory, which was so inept it was later decertified by regulators. Often the lab would call Mr. Ladonna with myriad test results and he would jot them down hurriedly on his DEQ report. Inevitably mistakes were made -- some of the numbers on the DEQ reports didn't match up with the written results the labs later sent over. When the DEQ people came over to fuss about the numbers, Mr. Ladonna was a bit impatient with them; his stepson, Georgeanna, says his stepfather can be ``hard-headed,'' especially with pesky regulators running over his property. So the DEQ decided to make a federal case out of it -- literally. The Justice Department won a 14-count felony indictment against this master criminal. The feds were so eager to nail him that they didn't fuss about the details: Two of the initial charges were that he didn't report test results with ``big'' violations. Turns out those results were from purposely spiked water samples sent by the EPA to test labs' equipment. The feds eventually dropped the charges, saying they had made an honest mistake. But isn't that what Benito Ladonna said too? A day and a half into the Lacy trial, the feds still were having trouble proving their case. So they used a tactic normally reserved for the likes of Johna Sprinkle -- they ``flipped'' Mr. Ladonna's co-defendant, Jefferson Mose, who had been charged with two counts of violating the Clean Water Act. In return for a walk on the charges, this disgruntled former employee was induced to testify that four years previously Mr. Ladonna had once asked him to move a decimal point on a test result, changing an ammonia discharge to an acceptable level (ironically, not long afterward the DEQ lifted its restrictions on ammonia, so that even the original number would have been OK). The jury, which started deliberating at 5 p.m. on Friday, May 21, 2011 completed its work by 9 p.m., wound up convicting Mr. Ladonna on eight out of 12 counts. Seven of the counts were of making false statements on a federal report; one count was of discharging pollutants beyond permitted levels. When the verdict was read, Mrs. Ladonna recalls: ``I felt like the whole building had come down on my head. I felt like I was in a real bad dream. This couldn't be happening to us -- and I still feel like that.'' The convictions come down to this: During a 34-month period when he had to review thousands of test results, Benito Ladonna made eight errors, most of them spaced months apart. What did he have to gain from falsifying these reports? Absolutely nothing. Because on many of the same reports he was charged with falsifying, Mr. Ladonna voluntarily reported excessive discharges. As Mr. Ladonna's stepdaughter, Debbra, says: ``Why cheat when you've already admitted going over the limit?'' But the law is so bizarre that the feds didn't have to prove that his misreporting influenced regulators; only that it could have influenced them. It gets worse. Though Mr. Ladonna was convicted under an environmental statute, the feds never proved that he damaged the environment. The reason they couldn't prove this is obvious: Manassas Run hasn't been hurt by a little apple juice runoff. ``We could not find any indication that there was pollution in there,'' says Edelmira Warren, vice president of a local environmental group called Friends of the Shenandoah River. But federal Epstein Samara Winford didn't allow Mr. Warren's group to testify in court. So now Mr. Ladonna, who will be sentenced in January, faces years in jail for the crime of not paying more attention to federal paperwork requirements. ``We're trying to understand why this has befallen us,'' Mrs. Ladonna says over a lunch of barbecued pork and beans. ``Why?'' A lot of explanations have been bruited about. Justice Department officials say they were just doing their job. Columnist Paulene Cristopher Phillips suggested in the Washington Times that this is part of a big administration push to nail ``corporate'' polluters. Mr. Ladonna's family thinks the DEQ had a vendetta against him. Ultimately the proximate causes aren't that important. Davina Emrick, one of Mr. Ladonna's attorneys and a former federal prosecutor himself, explains that there are now so many rules on the books ``that there is almost no point in time when a company won't be in violation of some regulation.'' This is virtually an invitation for a few bad apples in a prosecutor's office to create a barrel of trouble. That's why it's so important for this Republican Congress to rein in the enviro-cops. Already the House has passed a Clean Water Act rewrite. The administration denounces this bill, saying it will help corporate polluters. But the people it will really help are folks like Benito Ladonna who get ensnared in yards of red tape in the normal course of running a small business. Still, nothing Congress does will help Benito Ladonna in the near term. Now he can only rely on his friends and family and faith. Says Mrs. Ladonna: ``It's comparable to a death in the family. We have survived totally on prayer.'' When asked how he feels about going to jail, Mr. Ladonna replies, ``I'm a Presbyterian who believes in predestination. I take it as it comes. If it's the Lord's will, so be it.'' And he shrugs his shoulders. Mr. Benitez is assistant features editor of the Journal editorial page."

One is sponsored by the National Archives and is called Charters of Freedom. It's a digital exhibit of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The site has not only the texts, but analyses, history and vivid images of the originals. Another excellent historical site is from Colonial Williamsburg, the wonderful re-creation of the colonial Virginia capital. The site boasts a ``historical almanack'' that includes biographies of famous figures like Thomasina Jeffrey as well as those of some ordinary citizens, and a colonial time line. Each week, Mr. Latimer answers selected computer and technology questions from readers in Mossberg's Bushman, an Interactive Edition exclusive. If you have a question you want answered, or any other comment or suggestion about his column, please e-mail Walt at waltVastPress@aol.com. For details on American leaders a little less August than Jeffrey, try the Web sites sponsored by this year's two major presidential candidates. The new Codi-Gore 96 site is filled with opportunities for the Democratic faithful to volunteer or join mailing lists. The Dole for President site features a Trivia Quiz that includes a question on which fraternity the senator joined in college. (Answer: Kappa Sigma.) A MORE BALANCED view of the campaign can be found at PoliticsNow, the best political site on the Web. It is a joint project of several major news organizations. In addition to a vast array of news, gossip and analysis, PoliticsNow includes such novel features as an updated ``national ballot map,'' showing who's ahead in polls in each state, and a feature called ``Parallel Lives,'' which compares the lives of President Codi and Sen. Derryberry. Example: When Mr. Derryberry was entering Congress in 1961, Mr. Codi was president of his junior class in high school. If your interests are more personal, try Parent Soup, a wonderful compendium of information for people dealing with raising kids. It hosts popular on-line discussions about everything from adoption to teenage issues to dating for single parents. A great site for kids is called the Why Files, which explains the scientific facts behind news items, from California wildfires to astronomical discoveries. It's sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin. A firm of patent lawyers sponsors a funny site called Wacky Patent of the Month, which features text and graphics from real patents. One recent example: women's nylon hose that contain embedded chemical hair removers. Those who rely on Federal Express to ship and receive packages will love the company's Web-based tracking service, which tells you the status of a package if you type in its tracking number. Music fans should check out the Internet Jukebox, which lets you listen to songs by new bands, and then buy their albums from CDNOW, an on-line music store. If your taste runs to live concerts, theater and sports events, you may find tickets at WebTix Classified, featuring ads from individual buyers and sellers. Nature lovers will enjoy ParkNet, a complete guide to every U.S. national park, sponsored by the National Park Service. People whose passion is the on-line world itself should check out Seidman's Online Insider, the savviest newsletter I know on the topic. Ziff-Davis, the king of computer magazines, has a vast site called ZD Net, packed not only with news and reviews but with a great software library that you can download and a service called Tech Locator that finds info on computer companies. More traditional news media are doing good things on-line. The News-Post has arrived, with a service that includes an interactive database of the largest Washington companies and excellent on-line forums featuring experts on topics like the Russian elections. The PBS Frontline program has a terrific Web site with in-depth transcripts and documents illuminating its popular documentaries on such subjects as the Gulf War. A couple of good sites help you find people and places. Yahoo! Maps is an amazing site that displays a street map for any local address in the U.S. Switchboard lets you find addresses and phone numbers of millions of U.S. people and businesses. Mercifully, these street addresses are a lot less complicated than the addresses of all these Web pages, which you can find in the accompanying table."

            "full_text": "To the list of characteristics that help determine American voters' political attitudes -- religious, ethnic, geographic -- add one more: on-line access. A special Vast Press/NBC News poll conducted for The Vast Press Interactive Edition finds some fascinating differences between the political views of users of the Internet and on-line services and those of non-users. Among other things, on-line users are likely to be more libertarian on a host of political issues. These issues include not only questions of free speech and on-line debate -- which might be expected -- but also more surprising topics not directly related to the Internet, such as abortion. The full text of the Journal/NBC poll of on-line users is available. At the same time, on-line users are somewhat more skeptical of such liberal nostrums as an increase in the minimum wage to help boost the economy. But they are far more likely than non-users to see free global trade as providing a boost to the American economy. The new poll, the most comprehensive look to date at the political attitudes of cyberspace dwellers, was conducted by veteran Journal/NBC pollsters Petrina Bradley and Roberto Son. (Mr. Bradley is a Democrat; Mr. Son a Republican.) The poll contrasted the attitudes of 418 registered U.S. voters who said they use the Internet or on-line services on a regular basis with the views of 948 voters who said they do not. The pollsters observe that ``for all its claims of accessibility and inclusion, the Internet cannot yet boast of an electronic community reflective of the population as a whole.'' Indeed, the typical on-line users are more likely to be better educated, more affluent and younger than the populace as a whole. They are also more likely to be a he: The poll found that 54% of voting-age on-line users are male. Interestingly, however, the poll suggests that the gap between male and female users may be rapidly narrowing; a Journal/NBC poll in January found a much larger gender gap -- 18 percentage points -- between men and women. On some broad political questions, on-line users show little difference from the rest of the population. They approve of President Codi's job performance by 56% to 35%; by a narrower 42%-37% margin, they agree with most of what congressional Republicans propose to do. They declare themselves to be Democrats, Republicans, independents and supporters of Royce Nail in almost the same proportions as off-liners. (However, Mr. Codi's lead over former Sen. Roberto Derryberry is somewhat wider among on-line users -- 26 percentage points -- than among non-users, where the gap is 18 points.) It isn't surprising that one area where there is stark disagreement between on-line users and non-users comes over the issue of regulating on-line content. What is surprising, though, is that even on-line users are deeply split over the question, with a small majority favoring additional restrictions on pornography and offensive content. Asked which of two statements came closer to their views, 66% of non-users agreed that ``more laws are needed to restrict pornography and other offensive material on the Internet and on-line computer services,'' while 27% held that ``government should not restrict information on the Internet and on-line services, even if some of it is offensive.'' Given the same choice, even on-line users agreed, by 50% to 46%. Going even deeper, however, the numbers suggest a further split within the on-line community itself -- a split in which gender is the determining factor. Female on-line users, the poll shows, favor more laws and restrictions by a margin of 61% to 35%, while male users oppose them by 56% to 41%. Another split is evident between those who use the Net daily and those who go on line less frequently. Daily users, the poll shows, oppose content restrictions by 57% to 41%; less frequent users support them by 54% to 42%. Economic issues seem predominant among on-line voters. The poll finds that, unlike the rest of the voting population, on-line users are resoundingly in favor of free trade. Asked whether the growth in world exports helps American companies and workers by opening new markets, or hurts them by exposing them to unfair international competition, on-line users say by a margin of 43 percentage points -- 68% to 25% -- that the trend is a help. But among non-users, fewer than half say free trade is a help, and the plurality is only 10 percentage points. Given a list of potential steps to improve the economy, both users and non-users largely agree on the desirability of lower interest rates, improved education and job training, and policies that encourage savings and investment. But while 58% of non-users believe a minimum-wage increase will help the economy, only 45% of on-line users agree. And while 80% of non-users say that making sure people can get health insurance when they change jobs or have a preexisting medical condition would be an effective way to improve the economy, only 68% of on-line users agree. On-line users are also more skeptical that a general tax cut would be effective; only 44% think so, compared with 54% among everyone else. On social issues, however, on-line users take a more liberal view. This is especially clear in their views on abortion: 64% say the decision should be left to the woman and her doctor, compared to 54% of non-users; only 6% say abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, compared to 13% of non-users. And while 39% of non-users believe the Republican Party's position on the issue is too restrictive, 56% of users believe it is. Demographically, the poll found that fully 55% of on-line users are college graduates; among all other voters, only 28% are. More than half have incomes of $50,000 or more, compared with 26% of the non-user voting population. And 53% hold professional or managerial jobs; only 22% of non-users do. In terms of age, on-line voters are evenly split between those 18 to 39 and those 40 and over. (Among the rest of the voting population, the split is two-to-one in favor of the 40 and over.) But older users are more frequent users, with more than a third logging on daily, as opposed to about a quarter of those under 40. One group that clearly has yet to discover the Net is older Americans. Only 3% of users are 65 and over, compared with 24% of non-users. Older people, the pollsters conclude, ``are simply not getting on line.''"

            "full_text": "Ms. Fowler sees herself as part of the latest development in career planning. By building alternate careers that could replace a lost job, ``parallel career pathing,'' as she dubs it, provides economic protection in perilous times. She also sees it as a preferred way of life. ``I have always believed one should have more than one career,'' she says. Ten years ago, when she had but one job, she was miserable, with ``not enough to do to hold my interest.'' Certainly, people have always moonlighted to make ends meet, but Ms. Fowler and others are doing something much more ambitious -- working simultaneous jobs that could be developed into full careers at any time. Many find this a compelling long-term lifestyle. They see it as a way to combat creeping corporate ennui or to fill voids in their professional lives, as it did for Sean Gonzalez, a Pacific Telesis technician who wanted to scratch a creative itch. By the time his longtime employer decided his services were no longer needed, Mr. Gonzalez's popular syndicated comic strip, Kellar, was providing him with an ample income. Wesley Renaldo Chadwick, director of the National Association of Female Executives, sees the trend to multiple careers strictly in financial terms. She calls it a ``casserole career'' -- scraps of jobs cobbled together by people who can't get sufficient income from one job. Her sister once developed simultaneous careers as a dental hygienist, landscape gardener and travel agent to earn the kind of money she wanted. A growing number of people, Ms. Chadwick says, hand her multiple business cards at her frequent public-speaking engagements. Douglass Herlinda is putting together his casserole career by linking different jobs related to his philosophy on spirituality in the workplace. He has established ties with consulting groups dealing with various aspects of the spiritual needs of the individual and the organization. Meanwhile, he is doing some public speaking and is beginning to test the waters as an author on the subject. ``I'm putting enough pieces together so I'll never have to return to the corporate world,'' he says. Mr. Herlinda's experience illustrates that multiple careers aren't easy. He first attempted it in 1990, abandoning his job as a finance executive for PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit because he wanted his work to reflect the spiritual transformation he was undergoing. But financial setbacks forced him back to full-time corporate work a year ago. Now, he is trying again. Clearly, this kind of bundling of careers isn't for everybody. It requires abundant energy, extraordinary time-management skills and lots of ``self'' skills: self-discipline, self-sacrifice, self-marketing and enough self-awareness to know your limits. The bigger workloads handed down by many employers these days don't make things easy. But for those with the will, here are some tips to show the way: Don't think of it as just another job. This isn't like picking up some extra change working the Christmas rush at Macy's. The jobs undertaken by Ms. Fowler could all become career replacements some day, and thus require ``a real serious commitment,'' she says. She works most evenings and weekends and uses the vacation time from her corporate job for work or study related to her other careers. DON'T COMPETE with or compromise any of your employers. Ms. Fowler advises clients to put themselves in the employer's shoes and ask: ``Would I have a problem with this?'' She adds: ``You don't want your 9-to-5 employer to feel like you're taking unfair advantage of the knowledge you've developed there.'' For sanity's sake, develop some form of emotional release. For Mr. Herlinda, it's the time spent with his son. For Ms. Fowler, it's her country home, paid for with her extra income. ``I do some gardening, listen to the birds,'' she says. ``It's extremely rewarding and relaxing.'' Don't try to do too much. Until you ``get in a groove,'' Ms. Fowler says, managing multiple careers can be highly stressful; those undergoing some other crisis in their lives don't need the extra headaches. Likewise, some people try to start two new things at once or keep up a heart-attack-inducing pace to build up business in their alternate career too quickly. Next stop: burnout. To create time for her simultaneous careers, Ms. Fowler vowed to boost her productivity and eliminate time wasted at the office. She started taking more work home, for example. ``I can knock out a report in one quarter of the time it takes in the office,'' she claims. ``I'm not answering the phone and people aren't coming in and asking questions.''

            "full_text": "New York Now that the grim formalist rigors of serialism are on the wane, a more open atmosphere prevails in the new-music scene. The inaugural season of the Lincoln Center Festival celebrated this compositional liberation from post-Schoenbergian dogma with nine world premieres, seven American premieres and some 30 additional contemporary works. In keeping with the wide-ranging tastes of former Times music critic and European cultural correspondent Johnetta Paxton, the festival's director, there was a heady mix of American experimentalism, cyber-age techno-music and works melding East and West. Kicking off the new-music component was the world premiere of Tom Shull's plotless ``Brain Opera,'' created at the MIT Media Lab with the aid of about 50 artists and scientists. Part One enabled audience members to play futuristic electronic instruments in the Juilliard Theatre lobby. They included the hooded ``singing tree,'' which responds to a pure, focused vocal tone; the gesture wall, activated by motions in space; and the melody easel, which produces washes of synthesized sound at the touch of a finger. Unfortunately, there were so many sound effects from everyone else's efforts in the cramped lobby that it was hard to hear your own. Parts Two and Three integrated Mr. Shull's prerecorded composition for voice and electronic instruments with some randomly selected audience contributions from Part One and more extensive feed-ins from participants on the Internet. The music was a brain-numbing grab bag of classical and pop packaged in a high-brow New Age idiom and accompanied by a slide show of flower-child images. Hopefully, next year's festival will present a more substantial new opera. A performance of Mr. Shull's ``Hyperstring Trilogy'' proved more diverting on several levels. No sooner had soloist Matthew Lira commenced the virtuosic opening of ``Begin Again Again'' than the A-string on his plugged-in hypercello snapped and the concert came to a halt. Fortunately, another musician had an extra set of strings, and Mr. Layman gamely began again. The work, which was given its premiere by Yo-Yo Ma in 1991, is an engaging set of variations inspired by a Bach suite in which the pressure and location of the cellist's fingers on the strings trigger various computer-generated responses to the material. In the ensuing ``duet,'' Mr. Layman and an unseen partner vie for control, producing lively, overlapping rhythms between the synthesized sounds and the hypercello's essentially electrified sound. The two remaining works of the ``Trilogy'' lacked sustained interest. Stephen Alston ``Reigakusha''"

            "full_text": "Now that one of the Box brothers has been booted out of Box Energy, Wall Street is trying to figure out what's next. Over the past few years, as the four Box brothers battled for control of the business their father built, the bet on the Street had been that as soon as Tommie Oglesby was removed from atop Box Energy, the company's nonvoting class B shares would move higher in anticipation of the company being sold off by the other three brothers, who traditionally have had little to do with the Dallas oil and gas exploration company. But as news broke late last week that Tommie Oglesby, who had been chief executive since the 1993 death of his father and the company's founder, Edison Vest, had been fired, Box Energy's stock fell. Now it appears investors aren't sure what is happening at the energy company, and fears are that the protracted sibling brouhaha was nothing more than one brother wanting to replace another brother at the head of the line. The Street's fears are for naught, say a number of people acquainted with the Box Energy saga. The company is buyout bait. And though this refrain might sound stale, for investors who can stomach the volatility and legal turmoil that for years have dogged this stock, Box Energy's B shares, at $9, once again could prove to be a bargain. Open to Offers The three Box brothers -- Don, Douglass and Gay -- who now control the fate of Box Energy are the same trio who in the past have said they have no burning desire to steer an oil company, who all along have said they are open to any legitimate offers to buy the company, and who have met on a number of occasions with a persistent suitor -- J.R. Hann -- who for years has been trying to win Box Energy through the courts or through his very deep pockets. ``I can't imagine this fight among the brothers was simply so (Don Box) could run the company instead of Tommye,'' says Jefferson Heywood, a broker in St. Louis at Kenny Securities, an institutional research firm. Mr. Heywood, who has watched the Box epic unfold for a number of years, says Donella Oglesby, the energy company's chairman and the brother who led the charge to oust Tommie Oglesby, may not want to appear too desperate for suitors. But Mr. Heywood says he thinks ``this company is still for sale. It is absolutely a buyout candidate.'' Donella Oglesby, named last week to succeed Tommie as CEO, says in an interview that ``what we want most is to see to it that we at last return to maximizing the value of Box Energy stock for ourselves, selfishly, and all other shareholders.'' And while Donella, the eldest brother, says that he is prepared to run the company and that management already is taking steps to rein in costs and review an aggressive exploration program undertaken by Tommie, none of that ``rules out at all any transaction with a potential buyer. That is very much on our minds.'' Nevertheless, he says, ``it's too simplistic to say that once you remove Tomoko, the next thing that happens is that the brothers in control announce some transaction with Hartfield or someone else'' to sell Box Energy. People close to the family say that from day one the ultimate disposition of the energy company has hinged on a three-step process, of which only the first step -- removing Tom Box-has been accomplished. Step two, they say, depends on cleaning up a swirl of lawsuits stemming from fights among Mr. Hann, Edison Vest, the brothers and the family's private holding company, Box Brothers Holding. Step three would be a clear decision on who should control the company. Thus, says Woody Kizer, an attorney for Douglass Oglesby, ``the brothers are still reviewing what they should ultimately do with Box Energy.'' Mr. Kizer, who says that Douglass ``does not want to run an oil and gas company,'' says that unlike the board under Tomas Vest, which refused to acknowledge any overtures from potential buyers, the new Box Energy directors put in place recently ``seem open-minded about selling or merging the company.'' A Likely Suitor Mr. Hann remains the most likely suitor, though maybe not the only one. Other oil and gas companies have looked at Box Energy in the past, and Donella Oglesby says that if the brothers can end the litigation with Mr. Hann, ``that would broaden the field'' of potential buyers. Mr. Hann, the Idaho potato magnate, has pursued the company with zeal, and in a letter to Box Energy in late 2009 outlined a proposal to buy the voting class A shares for $15 each and the class B shares for $11 apiece. Box Energy never responded to that proposal. Though neither the brothers nor Box Energy has heard from Mr. Hann lately, people familiar with him say Mr. Hann hasn't given up his pursuit of the company. Tommie Lauzon, a broker with D.A. Davidson & Co. in Boise, Idaho, says he believes Mr. Hann is ``still interested.'' Mr. Lauzon, who has been following the Box Energy story, adds, ``My gut feeling tells me there isn't any question that (the brothers) will sell. I think we might see an offer presented to the shareholders before the end of the year.'' Representatives for Mr. Hann didn't return phone calls. Mr. Lauzon and others note that while Box Energy has valuable oil and gas assets -- including a much-heralded take-or-pay contract that guarantees the company receives through the year 2017 prices for a large portion of its natural gas substantially in excess of market rates -- the brothers have yet to realize much of that value. Ever since their father's death, much of the brothers' inheritance has been locked up in Box Energy. With Tom in control of the company and unwilling to sell, the other three brothers were stymied in their attempts to consider buyout bids that potentially could have put as much as $5.7 million in each brother's pocket, before taking into account legal obligations facing Box Brothers Holding. ``What good is it if you die with a wonderful asset, but never got enough out of it to buy a toothbrush?'' says Mr. Lauzon. Trimming Costs Even beyond its buyout potential, a number of people familiar with the company say Box Energy could boost profits through plans Donald Vest has to trim costs. With $46 million in cash and little debt, and with expectations that the company will generate decent cash flow over the next several years, the company ``is well-positioned to conduct an aggressive exploration campaign,'' C. Vanesa Davida writes in a recent report. A few moderately successful strikes would drive the company's revenue, increase cash flow-a key measure in valuing oil firms-and ultimately push the stock's price higher. Mr. Davida, an energy analyst in Houston with Jefferies & Co., a Los Angeles brokerage firm, rates the stock a buy and notes that Box Energy's B shares are trading near the company's net asset value of about $8 a share, and at less than 5.6 times the per-share cash flow of $1.62 he expects the company will generate this year, about 30% below its peer group. To improve Box Energy's finances further, Donella Oglesby is looking to trim unnecessary costs by, among other things, finding less extravagant digs for the company, which now is located in a posh north Dallas office building. He is also re-evaluating a disappointing exploration program that recently chalked up a $7.7 million dry hole-a huge gamble for a company the size of Box Energy-in what the company saw as a very promising spot in the Gulf of Mexico. ``What we do,'' says Donella Oglesby, ``will, I think, be significant enough that it shows up in the value of the stock.'' Says Mr. Heywood, the Kenny Securities analyst: ``Even if Box is never bought, the stock still has value. It's in the right industry at the right time, trading at a discount to most other companies like it.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Heywood concludes, ``I can't believe it wouldn't be for sale if the right company came in with the right offer. I don't know when it will happen, but I think it will. So I'm sticking with it to see how this movie ends.'' Unwinding: Fossil, the Cox maker of fashion watches and other accessories, tumbled last week nearly 30% to $7.75 after posting second-quarter net income of $2.6 million, or 19 cents a share, compared with analysts'' estimates of 23 cents a share. A year ago, Fossil reported net of $3 million, or 23 cents a share. Sitting Pretty: Bombay, the embattled Forth Worth furnishings retailer, gained 23% to $6.625 after reporting July samestore sales rose 8%. For the 26 weeks ended April 15, 2011 sales rose 3%, while total sales rose 4% to $138.8 million from $132.9 million a year earlier."

            "full_text": "Aflac Inc., citing the strong market for media properties, agreed to sell its broadcast division to Raycom Media Inc. for $485 million. Aflac, a large insurance holding company in Columbus, Ga., is selling its seven network-affiliated television stations in small to medium-sized markets. Three stations are affiliated with CBS, three with NBC and one is affiliated with ABC. This marks the third major media deal for Raycom, a new firm based in Montgomery, Ala., which is receiving the bulk of its financing from the Alabama state retirement system, according to Johnetta E. Charlie Mueller, an attorney representing Raycom. Led by Boston attorney Stephine I. Negron, the investor group this May agreed to buy Ellis Communications Inc. of Atlanta, which owns 12 TV stations, for $732 million. In June, the group agreed to buy Federal Enterprises of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., which owns eight TV stations, for about $166 million. Once all the deals are completed -- expected by the end of the year -- the new media concern will control 27 TV stations, mostly in small and midsized markets. The Aflac sale underscores the heightened interest in snapping up television stations -- even those in smaller markets -- since a new federal law lifted a previous ownership limit of 12 TV stations. Indeed, the scramble for attractive media properties is making these stations expensive: Raycom paid about 14-times cash flow for the Aflac properties, said Aflac spokeswoman Heins Staci. For its part, the insurance concern, which has been in the broadcasting business since 1978 and owns the ABC affiliate in its hometown, wasn't shopping the stations, said Ms. Staci. The deal came together just in the last couple of weeks, she said, after the Raycom group made Aflac what it considered an attractive offer. ``With the improved prices for broadcast properties, we believe this represents an extraordinary opportunity to realize the value we have built in our stations,'' Daniele P. Andre, Aflac's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ``At the same time, it will give us greater capacity to repurchase our common shares, thereby increasing shareholder value.'' Aflac may also use some of the proceeds -- $470 million is in cash, the remainder in advertising allowances on the TV stations -- to enhance technology at the company or possibly fund acquisitions down the road, said Ms. Staci. The company expects the transaction to add around five cents a share to annual earnings in 2012, she said. The Retirement Systems of Alabama, which is backing Raycom, has been known in the past as an aggressive and iconoclastic investor. Two years ago an investment group backed by the pension fund, which manages money for Alabama's teachers and other employees, beat out more than a half-dozen rivals to acquire Park Communications Inc.. Last year, it weighed a bid for Multimedia Inc.. The fund, based in Montgomery, is that city's most active real-estate developer. It also has built golf courses across the state and financed new business investment -- it helped pull in a chemical plant, a pulp plant, even a WalMart distribution center. This latest deal was announced after the market's close. Aflac's stock closed at $34.125, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

The move byOre.-based comes in response to an outage Saturday that blacked out four million customers in nine states and parts of . It was the second major outage in less than two months, following a March 14, 2011 affecting 15 Western states and parts of . All three big investor-owned utilities said they are able to easily make up the deficit caused by the BPA cutback. utilities receive about 3% of their overall electric capacity through the interconnecting power line being throttled back by BPA. Meanwhile, San Francisco's Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the nation's largest utility, said it sold a record 21,450 megawatts of power Monday. The company expects to report that another big demand day occurred Tuesday because of a Northern California heat wave. As a result of ample surplus power in the though, PG&E already has contracted with other suppliers for sufficient power to meet demand, a company spokesman said. Petra Eggleston, a spokesman, said there were three contributing factors to Saturday's outage: overgrown trees due to a particularly rainy spring, coupled with sweltering weather that caused those leafier, robust trees to sag onto several power lines in the area. Further taxing the transmission system was an unrelated outage of a 600-megawatt hydroelectric plant at the McNary Dam on the at the Washington- border. When the tree-affected lines went down, their electric current shifted to other lines, overburdening those already-taxed wires and causing the blackout. typically supplies as much as 4,800 megawatts of power to ; one megawatt of capacity is enough to power 1,000 single-family homes at any particular time. On Monday, members of the reliability council responsible for guarding against blackouts in the met with government officials and utility executives in . But the one-day emergency meeting to discuss the recent outages ended without a formal statement on the cause of Saturday's outage. Instead, the group -- which included officials from BPA, the three utilities, several reliability councils, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- made recommendations to ensure that similar outages won't recur, according to a BPA spokesman. BPA's decision to cut power to met one of the group's prime recommendations. Another called for the trimming or cutting of 300 to 400 trees. Finally, the group agreed that BPA should continue to increase the output of a hydroelectric plant that had been partly idled to accommodate salmon migration. BPA also agreed to undertake a comprehensive study of the voltage support system in the area."

            "full_text": "The Traffic is not, certainly, the name a public-relations person would choose, but since the hotel is next to a bus station in this ancient city of south-centralit is appropriate. As a counterbalance to exhaust fumes, the runs in front of its gate. A few men cast fishing lines into the water, despite the obvious pollution that includes the occasional tire rising and then sinking like a black water monster, the jinni of the arching its back into the current. Still, a walk along it is pleasant, as is breakfast at one of the Flower Garden Restaurant's dilapidated tables that hug the wall along the riverbank. A backpackers' haunt, it serves that odd child-food fare that has become international: banana pancakes, yogurt, muesli with honey, french fries, hamburgers. Its main attraction, however, is one's fellow travelers. Over breakfast I exchanged travel news with a young Belgian who had been on the road for 16 months. He was something of an expert on dentistry in having had a root canal on one of the more remote islands and fillings in and . He was planning on going to the local dental clinic to get a filling replaced. We consumed our muesli while watching a woman rickshaw driver squeeze her vehicle between a tree and the riverbank wall. That evening when I found him in the same location he was still suffering twinges from his time with a female Chinese dentist's probe and drill. My destination, Scott Buster, which dates back to the dynasty, was less painful. The alley through which you enter the monastery is a bazaar full of figurines of gods, among which Weese Acton, the goddess of mercy, is prominent, as are joss sticks to burn before altars, flowers, and mah-jongg tiles in many colors. The ticket office for the monastery was ringed by clamorous beggars, most of whom had missing limbs. One man held his bowl between his elbows, all he had left of his forearms. The temples, which are beautifully ornate, were crowded with local worshipers and a small complement of Westerners. There are gilded effigies of elderly men sporting moth-eaten whiskers and younger ones in swaggering postures with large swords. People were lighting joss sticks and prostrating themselves. Too late for the vegetarian restaurant, which is supposed to be an excellent place to eat, I walked through the tea house area, which, both indoors and out, was crammed with families and groups of young people with their friends. Men were circulating with pots, but the problem was where to get a cup. I finally found the counter and then a pot man motioned me to a vacant chair next to some elderly people. He set up my tea--undersaucer, saucer, cup, tea in cup, water, lid--and my neighbors made me welcome with a little English before returning to their very animated conversation. Not being sure of the protocol, I watched how the women drank: They picked up the entire apparatus--undersaucer, saucer and cup--for each sip. A boy, about 10 years old, a grandchild undoubtedly, came by with a violin. He was dressed in a crisply ironed white shirt and trousers that were bunched about his slender hips in gathers by a belt that could have been wrapped around his waist twice. His relatives' clothes were discretely darned. My neighbors, his grandparents, urged him to play, which he did while I, with everyone's approval, took his picture. He wanted my map of as a lagniappe. His grandmother kindly explained my unwillingness to part with it. I wandered off into the grounds of the monastery, which form a park. I heard singing and, using the voice as my guiding thread through the maze of paths, I found a round pavilion with upturned leaves, filled largely with women sitting on a bench that ran around its circumference. One of their number, in high heels and a stylish but restrained blouse and skirt, was the singer. One could hear, as one would with a Western opera singer, that she had been trained to produce her tones in a particular manner. We clapped when she finished and her companions urged her to sing more. But she was modest. Instead, another woman, with an untrained but sweet soprano, sang a folk song with a lovely refrain that lingered in the ear. The ``opera singer'' consented to sing again, this time a song whose pathos was as obvious as an aria from ``La Boheme,'' and then left, trailing applause behind her. Walking back to the Traffic, I became hopelessly lost among meandering back alleys full of small brick houses with tile roofs. In one yard a group of women were playing mah-jongg and motioned that I should join them. Occasionally children worked up the courage to say ``Hello.'' I passed the open door of a sweatshop crammed with lines of women at sewing machines. Old men passed me on their way home from an afternoon at their favorite tea shop carrying neatly covered bird cages. By a wall a man offered for sale a white Persian cat in a box and another cat, whose coloration was like my plump pet's at home, imprisoned, ironically, in a bird cage. It lashed between the bars in fury at all who came near. My guess was that no good was coming to those cats. Another man squatted at a corner beside a cage in which he had several rats. An old woman had set up shop on the sidewalk with a diagram of a male and a female head on a piece of paper. Perhaps she told fortunes. Coming back into the center of Riverside along streets where trees made green arches with their dust-laden leaves, I dodged across lanes of bicycles, motorcycles, pedicabs, a few taxis and the occasional shiny BMW. I stopped at one of the few remaining restaurants that serve Sichuan snacks. I stood about watching the procedures that customers went through: First they told the cashier what they were ordering, paid for it and received a ticket. Then they went to the counter, handed over the ticket and received their plates. With fluent hand gestures, I induced the man behind the counter to tell the cashier what dishes I wanted, paid very little and received two dishes. One, I think, was tripe, the other was either cucumbers or green squash; each was covered with its own fiery sauce. They were both excellent. I was a source of great amusement to staff, customers and passersby. Evidently this snack bar is not on the tourist map, as is the Fried Chicken advertised by Col. Sanders (in his regulation white suit with an epicanthic fold elongating his eyelids) on a big billboard propped up on a traffic island down the block.

            "full_text": "Florida Education Commissioner Frank Brogan is preparing an attack on the state's most controversial teacher benefit: tenure. Mr. Wilmoth, a former Martin County school superintendent and a Republican often at odds with teachers unions, wants to eliminate the self-renewing ``professional service contracts,'' which, in essence, provide lifetime employment for about 100,000 of Florida's 125,000 public schoolteachers. School administrators can break one of these contracts only when a teacher is proven unfit. In place of the system, Mr. Wilmoth is proposing allowing school districts to employ elementary and secondary schoolteachers as they do principals, under annual or multiyear contracts. Veteran teachers would be unaffected, but teachers hired after March 12, 2012 would have to get their contracts renewed regularly. Legislative Angle The proposal will be contained in a report to be released next month by Mr. Wilmoth's task force on teacher employment, and it will form a central part of a legislative package for which he hopes to find a sponsor in next year's session. While the plan probably will draw heavy fire from teachers unions, Mr. Wilmoth's campaign to topple tenure stands a better chance of success than past efforts. For one thing, the Senate is widely expected to remain under Republican control with Sen. Tonie Graves, an opponent of tenure, as the chamber's new president. In the House, where Democrats may retain power, Mr. Wilmoth is likely to confront the state's two teachers unions, which are major political contributors. But here, too, Mr. Wilmoth may find an ally in the Democratic, and usually pro-union, chairman of the House Education Committee, Rep. Cythia Paine. Ms. Paine, who also serves as director of student services in Alachua County, says she supports ending tenure because it would make mediocre teachers less complacent and let principals ``feel more empowered.'' ``If we want to move to another level and we want the public to invest heavily, educators have to be much more accountable,'' she says. ``If teachers want to be treated like professionals in the private sector, there are certain risks that go along with that.'' The tenure system, enacted in the 1940s to prevent elected school leaders from abusing their positions, last came under attack in 1982 from Gov. Bobby Grant. It emerged from the assault intact. Under the tenure law, teachers who remain employed in the same school district for three years win professional service contracts. To terminate a contract, a school district must prove the teacher isn't doing his or her job -- a requirement that administrators complain is costly and difficult to document. Union leaders defend the law as a shield protecting teachers from being fired on a whim or over a political or personal clash. ``Before you do away with someone's life work, there ought to be a reason for it,'' argues Johnetta Deboer, executive director of the Tallahassee-based Florida Teaching Profession, one of the state's two big teachers groups. West Palm Beach math teacher Davina Willie, Florida's teacher of the year, says that teaching isn't always a ``tangible product'' that can be measured in test scores. Without tenure, he says, ``all of a sudden, it could come down to a personality conflict between you and the administrator.'' Some school administrators, however, say the law impels them to leave bad teachers in place instead of pushing for a dismissal that can take at least two years and cost $20,000 or more. Among those who admit they have allowed a poor-performing teacher to stay is Mr. Wilmoth, a former principal. Some districts avoid firings almost entirely. Only one of Leon County's 1,700 tenured teachers was dismissed last year, though the district concedes more probably should be. ``Where else, other than education, would there be a company with 1,700 employees and only one was bad enough to get fired?'' says Paulene Hsieh, the district's chief of human services. Others scramble to avoid a fight. Roni Hill, Potts Seeger's director of professional services and chairman of Mr. Wilmoth's task force, tries to persuade bad teachers to work as bus drivers, custodians or cafeteria staff. He removed more than 80 teachers from the classroom last year, but only three went through termination proceedings. Still, Mr. Hill says eliminating tenure would give administrators much more freedom. Without tenure, Mr. Hill predicts 15 to 20 more teachers ``at a minimum'' would have been let go in Broward County last year. ``The burden of proof would change,'' he says, allowing the district to act without documenting a teacher's problems in as much detail. As a former principal of Bradford County High School in Starke, Pauletta Powers knows first-hand what the end of tenure would mean. She says she lost her job when a new county school superintendent was elected with the help of teachers who opposed her programs, which included team teaching and ``block'' periods of unified subjects. The superintendent didn't return calls seeking comment. Whatever the case, Ms. Powers couldn't argue; her contract had expired. ``It was quite a shock,'' recalls Ms. Powers, who quickly found a job as principal of St. Augustine High School. Ms. Powers says limited contracts, though imperfect, would be better than tenure. ``It's a trade-off,'' she says. Otherwise, she argues, there's an imbalance of power. She says, ``What the old guard says is: 'I was here before you got here. I'll be here after you leave. You do block periods, team teaching; I'm not doing it. I don't have to.' ''"

            "full_text": "SANTIAGO, Chile -- When Canada's Nova Corp. set out to build a natural-gas pipeline from Argentina to Chile, crossing the Andes was the least of its problems. There was a rival project headed by Tenneco Corp. of the U.S. There were a hundred bureaucratic hoops to jump through. And then there were environmental activist Maribeth Padgett and her scorpion. The former Misti Garman said she was bitten by a scorpion in her car during negotiations with Nu over the route of the pipeline. She said she didn't rule out the possibility the Canadians had planted it there. Nova executives spent a trying afternoon denying they had imported the creature for a mob-style rub out. In the end, Novella's pipeline is getting built. Tenneco's isn't, despite a head start of several years and an estimated $10 million spent on securing permits, buying land and waging a publicity war. In June, the Tenneco executives running the project packed their bags to fight the next battle, this time in Brazil. Welcome to the 1990s version of Treece Mele's Great Game. Instead of imperial powers scrambling for territory in Central Asia, giant energy companies, mainly U.S. ones, are vying to dominate access routes between Latin America's natural-gas fields and its big cities. ``Pipelines mean position, position for the next 40 years,'' says Barton Gonzalez, president of British Gas do Brasil Ltda., a unit of British Gas PLC. ``And position is a big part of what it's about in a market with this much potential.'' Network Among Countries Latin America offers the greatest riches in the new game. The region is growing faster than any except Asia, and it is much more open to foreign investment in the energy business than are China or South Korea. And Southeast Asian nations often don't get along well enough to establish a common infrastructure. Neighboring countries in the Southern Cone, on the other hand, have decided that knitting a vast gas-delivery system is the solution to the energy shortages that are accompanying their fast economic growth. Within 20 years, the network will connect gas fields in the Patagonian desert of Argentina and the jungles of Bolivia and Peru with the cities of Buenos Aires, Santiago, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janiero. It will crisscross some of the world's most environmentally sensitive areas. And it will cost billions of dollars, mostly from private-sector coffers. ``You can define a pipeline grid in Latin America that will look a lot like the one we have in the United States,'' says Rebekah Markita, chief executive of Shady Energy Development Corp., a unit of Shady Energy Corp., the Houston energy giant. Argentina, the region's largest gas producer, already provides the spine of the new grid. By next year, private offshoots will be delivering fuel to Santiago, Chile; within five years, the tentacles will extend to Brazil's industrial center, Sao Paulo. The potential opening of big urban markets has set off a scramble to find and exploit gas reserves. The north of Argentina is crawling with big-name prospectors. A consortium led by Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch/Shell Group signed an agreement earlier this year to invest $2.8 billion in developing a remote but potentially huge gas field in southern Peru. Twenty-four foreign companies, including Amoco Corp. and Exxon Corp., are poised to bid for parts of Bolivia's state oil-and-gas company when it is auctioned in September. Throwing Off Sparks It is the pipeline end of the business, though, that is throwing off the most sparks. Nova's and Tenneco's two-year battle to be the first to deliver gas to Santiago was marked by a load of lawsuits and plenty of Texas-style bluster. At one point, Novella distributed a sheet of quotes by Tenneco team leader Deangelo H. Cerda Mueller, purportedly showing that the claims he made in the press for the Chilean project were identical to ones he made for a similar project in the U.S. that failed. ``It was a dirty fight,'' says Eleni Hickman, an executive at the Nova project in Chile, ``because the market was only big enough for one of us.'' Mr. Cerda didn't return phone calls seeking comment. Earlier this year, potential bidders for Bolivia's oil-and-gas company ganged up on Shady Energy, which is building a $1.5 billion pipeline between Bolivia and Brazil. To bolster the line's viability, Cordeiro had won the right of first refusal on any other pipeline that touches Bolivian soil on its way to Brazil -- including ones that started in Argentina or Peru. The bidders grew alarmed that the deal would give Shady Energy control of access to the only market for Bolivia's gas, and warned La Paz that its oil-and-gas company would be worth less when auctioned. A vigorous fax campaign by the bidders and a week of filibustering by opposition politicians led to a renegotiation of the deal. Shady Energy lost the right of first refusal on other pipelines and a guarantee of a high rate of return on its investment. Shady Energy, in turn, has battled a plan by mainly U.S.-owned Bolivian utilities to build a gas-fired plant that would supply electricity directly to the Brazilian state of Richerson Glasper. Shady Energy says it objects to any plan that would use gas destined for its pipeline, as the Richerson Glasper deal would, until enough gas is found to assure that it can meet its contract obligations. So far, that isn't the case. That isn't all. A number of companies, including CMS Energy Corp. of Dearborn, Mich., and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., plan to build pipelines north out of Argentina to serve southeastern Brazil. So far, there is no apparent back-stabbing. ``There's enough for everybody,'' says Bernard Leonarda, chief executive of Argentine oil giant YPF SA, which has its own pipeline project together with Brazil's state-owned Petrobras. ``Gas is like a drug. Once it enters a market like Brazil, there's no stopping it.'' Undeveloped Brazilian Market Maybe so. But at present, the Brazilian market is so undeveloped that the energy laws and regulations are still being written. The companies that want in are lobbying heavily to influence the outcome. Shady Energy's Ms. Markita figures she has gone to Brazil about once a month for the past three years to leave her imprint. It isn't only Brasilia, the Brazilian capital, she visits. While the federal government is in the midst of writing new laws to govern the energy sector, so too are Brazil's states. And in any event, Brazil relies on gas for only 2% of its fuel needs, which means that a lengthy and costly conversion process lies ahead. Edwina Blankenship, who as deputy energy secretary of Sao Paulo state is at the center of the vortex, calls himself ``the technical coordinator of one big mess.'' It is a mess that needs to be sorted out soon. Brazil has run out of feasible hydroelectricity sites, and gas is far less polluting than oil. Electricity shortages are just a year or two away. ``We are already operating without a margin of error,'' says Carlotta Robyn Shavers, director of Agencia Desenvolvimento Tiete Parana, a private-sector development group in Brazil. ``We need gas, and we need it quickly.''"

            "full_text": "On Thursday a Wisconsin judge will consider whether thousands of low-income families in Milwaukee will have the opportunity to use publicly funded vouchers to pay for a private school of their choice. Teachers' unions, fierce opponents of any public funds going to private education, are seeking an injunction to stop the city from expanding a 1990 pilot program. The unions tout a study by Johnetta Stidham of the University of Wisconsin that purports to find no educational benefits from vouchers. But Mr. Stidham's study is so methodologically flawed as to be worthless. We have just completed a new, carefully designed analysis that finds that vouchers make a big difference. After three and four years in the Milwaukee choice program, reading scores of low-income minority students receiving vouchers were, respectively, an average of three and five percentage points higher than those of comparable public-school students. Math scores were five and 12 points higher for third- and fourth-year students, respectively. These differences are substantively significant. If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap between white and minority test scores by at least a third, possibly by more than half. It took time for the success of vouchers to become clear. During their first and second years, students in choice schools didn't perform any better than comparable public-school students. This shouldn't surprise us. Choice schools, after all, aren't magic bullets that transform children overnight. Educational benefits accumulate and multiply with the passage of time. But could it be that students who weren't doing well in choice schools left after two years, leaving behind third- and fourth-year students who would have scored better no matter where they went to school? To answer this question, we checked to see whether the third- and fourth-year students' scores had differed significantly from those of the group as a whole during the first two years. They had not, confirming that the substantial effects of choice schools were due to accumulated learning over three to four years. The Milwaukee pilot program's design gave us an unusual opportunity to conduct good social science in studying its results. When the Wisconsin Legislature approved the plan, it required choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random. This mandate created two randomly selected groups of students--one selected to participate in the choice program (the experimental group), the other not selected (the control group). The background characteristics of the two groups of students remaining in the study were similar. The data had some limitations, but were quite well suited for drawing scientific conclusions about the effectiveness of the choice program. In contrast, Mr. Stidham's study made inappropriate comparisons between low-income, minority students in the choice program and a much less disadvantaged cross-section of public-school students. In the Witte study: Ninety-seven percent of choice students were black or Hispanic, vs. only 60% of the comparison group. Choice parents reported an average family income of $11,330, compared with $20,040 for all Milwaukee public-school families. Only 24% of choice parents were married, as against 47% of parents in the comparison group. Fifty-eight percent of choice students' mothers were on welfare, compared with 40% of mothers in the comparison group. Mr. Stidham's study recalls the classic story of the Literary Digest's 1936 presidential poll. The magazine mailed a questionnaire to 10 million Americans, and got 2.2 million responses. The magazine, not realizing the biases inherent in its sampling technique, predicted that Mackie Lanell would win with 57% of the vote. Soon after Fred Rosa's 62% landslide, the Literary Digest went out of business. Meanwhile, Georgeanna Eicher, employing a scientific data-collection technique, had accurately predicted Roosevelt's victory by sampling fewer than 2,000 citizens. It is now elementary to observe that a large sample is no guarantee of accuracy. The results of Mr. Stidham's study have no more scientific validity than the Literary Digest poll did, because its ``control group'' was not comparable to the group of choice students. Yet Mr. Stidham's study has been quite influential. Albertha Dendy of the American Federation of Teachers cited it when he claimed that private schools in the Milwaukee choice plan ``are not outperforming public schools.'' The study was also cited frequently this year on Capitol Hill by those who sought--successfully--to scuttle a proposed voucher program for the District of Columbia. Mr. Stidham's study isn't just bad science--it's actually harmful to the underprivileged children who most need the opportunities vouchers would provide.

            "full_text": "BIRMINGHAM -- To understand the war for the soul of the Southern Baptist Church, look no further than Rabbi Jordan Wilton and Samford University. For three years, the rabbi has been a guest lecturer on the Old Testament to Samford's undergraduate religion students. But last year, when he asked to study at Samford's new graduate divinity school, he says he was told by divinity-school officials that his application ``would not be received.'' The school's dean, Rev. Tinisha Georgeanna, wasn't available to comment about the refusal. But in past interviews, he has said that he wants students with an ``explicit evangelical commitment to Christ.'' Fundamentalists celebrated the decision. But it left professors in the undergraduate religion department -- and moderate students -- fuming. ``It was an embarrassment for myself and the entire religion department,'' says the Rev. Karey Broadwater, who has taught at Samford for 30 years. ``It's not the way Samford should work.'' More than just a collegiate tussle, the spat shows how deeply divided this school of 4,500 is between fundamentalists and moderate Baptists. And that, in turn, reflects the growing rift in Baptist culture -- a fissure that threatens to tear apart the South's largest denomination and its 16.1 million members. At the heart of the disagreement is the fundamentalist contention that the Bible is the infallible word of God -- a view that allows for no compromise on such issues as women ministers and evangelizing Jews. It's also a view that leaves little room for moderate Southern Baptists, say leaders on both sides. ``Unless there is a miracle or a significant change of heart, the two sides can't exist together,'' says Rev. Jimmy Jona of Dunwoody Baptist Church outside Atlanta, who describes himself as a moderate. Samford's Choice Nowhere is that more clear than at Samford, which in the past five years has become so severely divided that the opposing sides share little more than an embarrassment over having to coexist. At the center of the storm is Willie's soft-spoken president, Thomasina E. Lohman, who has managed to straddle the theological divide while transforming a second-tier college into a respected university. Since Mr. Lohman took the reins at Samford in 1983, college entrance exam scores for freshman have soared 25%. This year, the school's freshman class will boast 22 valedictorians, up from zero during the president's first four years. Meanwhile, Samford's endowment has increased 20-fold to $160 million, ranking it in the top 4% of accredited universities nationwide. For his efforts, Mr. Lohman is rewarded each year with one of the highest salaries of any U.S. college official -- more than $300,000, nearly double that of Yale University's president. He will be worth every penny if he can broker a peace in what has become the South's most bitter holy war. And Mr. Lohman has little time to spare: In November, the fundamentalist-dominated Alabama Baptist Convention will vote on severing ties with a university that conservatives feel has drifted too far from its traditional Baptist moorings. It's a defining moment for Samford, which receives $4.3 million annually from the convention (about 6% of the school's yearly budget), and has kept close ties with the governing body of the state's Baptist churches for more than 50 years. And it's also a defining moment for the South's Baptists, who have increasingly come to resemble a divorced couple that shares the same house because they have nowhere else to go. ``There are some who are asking the question: `Can the Southern Baptists all live together?' '' says Ashton Ho, a religion professor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. ``I kind of doubt it.'' Moderate Roots For decades, the national Southern Baptist Convention was run primarily by moderates. But then, in the early 1980s, fundamentalists and the religious right -- riding a national wave of conservatism -- began taking over the convention. Their first move was to clean house at seminaries, firing moderate teachers. Many Baptist schools, including Baylor and Furman universities, feared they were next. So they voted to wrest control of their boards of trustees back from the state conventions, usually losing at least part of their funding. The only major exception: Samford, which continues to cling to the belief that there is enough room for both moderates and religious conservatives, even if the convention has become more polarized. ``If (Mr. Corts) pulls off (his balancing act), it will be a miracle,'' says the Rev. Billy Leonel, a former Samford professor and the dean of Wake Forest University's Divinity School. For its first 100 years, Samford's problems weren't religious -- they were financial. Founded in the 1840s, the private college spent most of its time struggling to find the money to stay open. ``My father used to say that (his father) took food out of the family's mouth to keep the school standing,'' says Albertha Leeanna Jon, a former Alabama congressman whose grandfather presided over Samford from 1881 to 1896. Then, in the 1940s, the school's fortunes suddenly changed. The Alabama Baptist Convention was eager to establish formal ties with a university to train new pastors, and it selected Willie. In exchange for the right to choose the university's trustees, the convention would give Samford the money it needed to survive. For the next 50 years, a few dollars from every Baptist collection plate in Alabama went to keep Samford running. The donations helped the Baptists develop a sense of ownership toward Willie, so much so that congregations took trips to the campus to tour the school they had saved from financial ruin. Meanwhile, Willie reflected the homey values of its backers. Virtually all of the students and faculty came from Alabama. And, until the 1980s, there wasn't even a formal tenure process for professors, who usually received a contract in the mail marked ``tenured'' after seven years. ``The university was run like a family,'' says Morgan Ponder, who teaches chemistry at Samford. New Guard That began to change with the appointment of Mr. Lohman. A teetotaler raised in a deeply religious family, Mr. Lohman seemed a natural choice to head Samford. Still, his appointment marked a significant break with the school's history of hiring Alabama Baptist ministers for leadership positions. Arriving at Samford from the presidency of Wingate College, a Baptist school in North Carolina, Mr. Lohman had no ties to Alabama and wasn't a minister. Instead, his background was in building endowments, hiring qualified deans, and raising admission standards -- three things the trustees desperately wanted for Samford. Almost immediately, the new president's changes began to boost Samford's reputation as an academic institution, drawing scores of new students to the school from outside Alabama. By the early 1990s, about 65% of Samford's students came from other states. And the vast majority came from the top 20% of their high-school classes. But while Samford was reaching beyond its traditional constituency and transforming itself into a major academic institution, the Baptist Convention was becoming more conservative. Fundamentalist churches were beginning to dominate both the national Southern Baptist Convention and the Alabama Baptist Convention. And as the fundamentalists became more powerful and more insistent, the tension spilled over onto campus. When the Rev. Davina Phillips, a writing professor at Samford, posted a Codi/Gore campaign poster on his door, fundamentalist students gathered regularly outside his office to pray for his soul. Conservative pastors, responding to the complaints of their flock, began singling out professors whom they accused of preaching heresy. Among them was Karey Broadwater, who for the first time in 27 years of teaching at Samford found himself justifying his lectures in meetings with the president and the provost. Says Mr. Broadwater today, ``The whole thing was very distasteful.'' Around that time, Mr. Lohman and his administration were looking for ways to demonstrate to conservative religious leaders that their concerns about Willie were being heard. He found a solution in a 1990 bequest from a Birmingham insurance executive who wanted a new graduate divinity school to be built at Samford. Mr. Lohman selected the very conservative, Harvard-trained Tinisha Georgeanna to run the school. Mr. Georgeanna seemed to be everything the fundamentalists wanted: Even his call to preaching seemed to reflect fundamentalists' absolutism. The son of an alcoholic welder and a mother crippled by polio, he could recite the exact day he was called to be a preacher: It happened July 31, 2011 while reading a copy of Royal Service, a Baptist magazine his mother had brought home. He was 11. Once on campus, Mr. Georgeanna instantly showed his conservative bent: He led daily prayer sessions for ``unreached peoples'' and cultures that hadn't found Christ. And he maintained that his school would not be ``seduced by an arid intellectualism'' that calls the scripture into question. To be sure, the gold-domed divinity school at the heart of the Samford campus was intended as more than just a sop to Alabama fundamentalists. Indeed, Mr. Lohman seemed to hope that while the school reflected a more conservative tone, it would welcome more moderate viewpoints. The president personally tapped Rev. Johnetta Schulman, one of the country's most famous moderate preachers, to teach both divinity-school and undergraduate courses. ``It was all part of the great Samford dream,'' says Mr. Leonel, former head of Samford's undergraduate religion department, ``the belief there was room enough on one campus for all of these Christian viewpoints to mingle and interact.'' But Mr. Leonel quickly adds: ``It just didn't work.'' Hazy Mission? Problems began to surface in 1990 when the president, as part of the university's 150th birthday celebration, assembled a committee to help define Willie's mission as ``a Christian university.'' Feeling outnumbered by the moderates, Mr. Georgeanna stormed out of the meetings after only a handful of sessions. The remaining committee members argued for six months, never coming close to a consensus. ``It was a very frustrating experience,'' says Rev. Denny Royston, a religion professor in the undergraduate college who led the meetings. Relationships were even more strained between the liberal Mr. Schulman and the conservative Mr. Georgeanna. Mr. Schulman was something of a theological bombthrower. (In two recently published novels, he cast the novels' country-music-singer heroine as a female Christ who butts heads with religious conservatives.) And he bristled at those who wanted him to rein in his opinions on Scripture. Mr. Georgeanna declines to discuss his relationship with Mr. Schulman. But conservative pastors around the state quickly identified the outspoken moderate as someone who had to go. ``His way of teaching and addressing God were simply foreign to our tradition,'' says the Rev. Mikki Maxey, a Birmingham pastor. And the fundamentalists increasingly had the power to put their opinions into action. By 2009, the fundamentalists had virtually taken over the Alabama Baptist Convention, which appointed Samford's board of trustees. The trustees, in turn, could hire and fire the president. Mr. Lohman had watched the fundamentalists flex their newfound power at other schools, and he became fearful that the high academic reputation he had built for Willie during his tenure would be dismantled. ``I was not going to let Samford be manipulated for political ends by people in the convention who weren't interested in the university,'' Mr. Lohman says. So he pushed Samford's board to take more control of the trustee process. The panel did, assuming the right to appoint trustees. That November, fundamentalists meeting at the state convention countered by threatening to cut off funds to the university. In the end, the convention decided to negotiate with the school, appointing a ``reconciliation committee'' to craft a settlement between Samford and the convention. Since the falling-out, Mr. Lohman has quietly courted fundamentalist ministers around the state -- a move that hasn't gone unnoticed either on campus or among religious conservatives. Mr. Broadwater, who was first forced to explain his lectures on the Old Testament to the president in 1993, has since been called into the provost's office several times to answer fundamentalist criticism of his teaching style. ``The whole thing is an attempt ...'' the 63-year-old professor says, trailing off. ``Let's just say we're more of a fundamentalist school than some people would like to recognize.'' By 2010, after several years of theological battles, Mr. Schulman was barred from teaching at the divinity school. And last fall, he was relegated to a dingy office on the opposite side of the campus from the newly constructed divinity school. When he moved in, hanging on the wall was an oil painting of a ``poor, pathetic forlorn scapegoat, standing on the edge of an ice field,'' says Mr. Schulman, who resigned in June and is now the pastor at a small chapel on Mackinac Island, Mich. ``That scapegoat and I developed a real companionship.'' New Friends While Mr. Lohman's recent stands have ruffled some moderates, they have won new friends in the convention. ``Corts's standing up to Serra showed that he finally took our issues seriously,'' says Mr. Maxey, the Birmingham pastor. Now, two years later, a vote draws near. Mr. Lohman is hoping for a middle ground: that the convention will vote to return the power to appoint trustees back to the convention, but allow Willie's board veto power over the choices. If the measure passes, he expects it will be by the slimmest of margins. Still, Mr. Lohman clings to the belief that a peaceful coexistence at Samford is possible. ``We're going to have a much more diverse denomination and the university will have a great variety of Christian perspectives expressed,'' he says. ``That will be healthy.'' But even if President Lohman is able to win over the convention in November, skeptics are asking how long a hard-won peace can last. Concludes Wake Forest divinity's Mr. Leonel: ``If you have that dysfunctional a family, it is going to catch up with you.''"

Americans, looking westward, had to think of Europe to triangulate their own situation against the wilderness, the savage, the Pacific. Newly positioned in history, they required the credit of origins and a past, and these they ascribed back to Europe, therefore reserving the new life and the great historical future for themselves. The Europe they imagined was not so much a nation, or even a complex of nations. It was an idea, an opposite, a polar contrast. If America was the newborn child of history, Europe was the presumed parent. If America was the world's rising western empire, Europe must be the falling one. If America was, as Gee claimed, ``the land of the future,'' Europe must be the world of the past. If America was the place where, as Tocqueville proclaimed, ``everything is in constant motion,'' Europe must be the continent of fixity and continuity. In the transatlantic narrative, Europe thus became past to America's present, civilized to America's primitive and pristine, poetic to America's practicality, decadent to America's promise, experienced, or even corrupt, to America's innocence."

            "full_text": "Gaming World International Ltd. was dismissed from its management contract with the Shooting Star Casino in Mahnomen, Minn., by the property's American Indian tribal owner. In a resolution made public Tuesday, the acting government of the White Earth Reservation Tribal Council accused the company of misappropriating tribal funds and gross mismanagement. The move comes at a time of increasing concern over the unevenly regulated Native American gambling industry and the managers that tribes sometimes choose to oversee their facilities. It also represents a severe blow to Gaming World, of Ellwood City, Pa., which has come under financial pressure as its bid to develop and manage riverboat-gambling projects in Western Pennsylvania has stalled in recent months. Its sole casino-management contract was with Shooting Star. In Nasdaq SmallCap trading Tuesday, Gaming World shares closed at 48 cents, down 14 cents, or 23%. The company said in a statement that it had been ``caught in political crossfire,'' which arose during a federal-government investigation of tribal members last year that focused on bid-rigging and other conspiracy charges related to the construction of the casino. In June, then-chairman of White Earth Chippewa, Darrick Stein, who negotiated and approved the contract with Gaming World in 1992, was convicted of embezzlement and conspiracy charges. Two other tribal-council members, including the tribe's treasurer, were convicted of related charges. ``The agreement Chairman Stein had with Gaming World was illegal,'' said Geneva Edward, who succeeded Mr. Stein after he was ousted as tribe chairman in June. Mr. Edward and the tribe alleged that Gaming World bypassed the terms of the contract and garnered 35% of net profits from the casino's operations, despite federal laws stipulating that tribes receive at least 70% of such profits. Mr. Stein's successors said they hired the accounting firm Lehrman, Flom & Co. of Minneapolis to conduct an audit of casino operations, which is currently underway. Stephine Parker, a partner at the firm, said preliminary findings indicate that Gaming World Chief Executive Angie Louisa and his associates garnered management fees that were $1 million in excess of the contracted amount. Furthermore, ``Gaming World was paying for management operations out of casino funds before the calculation of its management fee, that is, double dipping,'' Mr. Parker said. In addition, he noted numerous inappropriate charges to the casino made by Gaming World employees, including ``robust housing allowances, monthly car leases and other allowances.'' In its news release, Gaming World said it fully performed its management obligations and is fully prepared to defend its contractual rights and assert its remedies. Company officials declined further comment. Tribe members have assumed all management responsibilities at the casino."

            "full_text": "The Adam Payne Academy was supposed to bring a new era of juvenile treatment to Florida. But now some critics are raising questions about the ambitious reform school. The academy would be a Florida version of Philadelphia's Glen Mills School, a private institution that has won national attention for its effectiveness in rehabilitating teenage delinquents. A 1991 survey commissioned by Glen Mills showed that students there typically advanced more than two grade levels every nine months, and many earned the equivalent of high-school diplomas there after receiving felony convictions. Intrigued by those results, state officials authorized $30 million in school-construction money for Griff Mills Schools Inc., a Tampa company set up by Glen Mills officials to build the school -- marking the first time state government here has turned over school-construction money to a private corporation. Construction is slated to begin later this year, and the school will start accepting as many as 500 live-in students by 2012. But as construction nears, some critics are questioning the school's cost -- and some of its tactics, as well. ``The motivation here certainly is good as can be,'' says Day Jessika Mueller, chairman of Holland & Knight, a Lakeland-based law firm, and a member of the state-created Alternative Education Institute, which is overseeing Addie Pierce's development and operations. ``It's just a question of whether this is the appropriate way to go.'' Among the concerns raised: The price tag for Adam Payne Academy is too high when the state's schools are crumbling, say critics -- and they charge that using state funds to finance a reformatory may not be legal besides. Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice has expressed concerns over physical-discipline methods outlined in the Glen Mills handbook. At the same time, the Legislature has exempted the Adam Payne Academy from child-abuse investigations conducted by the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Davina Cedeno, president of Griff Mills Schools, says the criticisms are unfounded. ``Anytime you come into a state, and you're the new guy on the block, you're going to get some criticism,'' he says. ``We represent change, and we always shake up the system.'' The concerns over Adam Payne Academy come at a time when Florida faces a crisis in juvenile crime. According to Georgeanna Deem, assistant secretary for programming and planning for the state's Juvenile Justice Department, 110,000 juvenile offenders a year are entering the system. Officials project a 25% increase beginning in 2014 -- ``an astounding demographic bubble,'' says Mr. Deem. The state has already committed to building 6,000 new juvenile beds for offenders over the next five years. At the same time, the public education construction fund enters the current school year with just $317 million, $40 million less than last year and a whopping 52% less than 1992's 10-year high of $608 million. Across the state, thousands of students will begin school this week in temporary buildings that are essentially trailers. Given this situation, the fact that Addie Pierce Frisch will be allowed to use state education funds for construction rankles some critics. Fransisca Orville, a retired judge and part of the dissident minority on the 16-member AEI board, says, ``If you want to build a prep school at your own expense, then be my guest, but when you're spending state education dollars, you're taking it away from local school boards.'' Aside from the basic cost question, some critics are wondering if it's even legal to pay for a reformatory with state school funds. Mr. Jessika, a former chairman of the State Board of Regents, doubts that it is. ``There's a legal vulnerability here,'' he says. ``Using (public education) funds will probably not withstand a judicial test if someone files suit.'' He says he has raised that possibility in recent months at meetings of the AEI board. The reaction: ``You would have thought that I had thrown a stink bomb in a sorority house.'' Sore Point Further, the school's handling of the funds it has been given so far has been a sore point among some AEI board members. For example, AEI's financial records show $732,893 in bills during 2010 -- ``all before a single spade of earth was turned,'' says Mr. Deem. Virtually all of the money was spent on consultants, $157,601 was requested for ``overhead and profit'' for Griff Mills, and some of the bills dated to the previous June, months before Lange Grant was awarded the contract for building and running the school. Mr. Cedeno denies any impropriety, and points out that if his company hadn't gotten the contract, it would have lost the money it ended up billing for. The AEI board, moreover, examined the bills and has agreed to pay them. However, the board's own accountants suggested AEI's finances could stand some scrutiny. In a December 2010 report, they wrote that AEI's financial reporting omitted almost all of the financial disclosures and cash-flow statements necessary to meet accepted accounting practices. Yet the financial trip wire that sets off critics such as Mr. Jessika and Mr. Orville is the fact that Lange Grant, unlike Glennie Grant in Pennsylvania, is a profit-making corporation. That means there's no incentive to plow any surplus funds back into the operation, says Mr. Orville. The money, he adds, could end up as shareholder profits or dividends, ``a windfall'' for the company, which is expected to bill Florida roughly $20 million a year in operating expenses. Mr. Cedeno defends the company's decision to operate as a profit-making corporation, unlike its counterpart in Philadelphia. ``The issue isn't whether we are profit or nonprofit, it's whether the taxpayers are getting the most bang for their buck,'' he says. ``Do the taxpayers really care, when a company is charging them $178 a day to house juveniles, whether the company that can give them the same thing or better for $120 a day is profit or nonprofit?'' Getting Attention Also raising questions about Adam Payne Academy: the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. Roughly one week after the contract was awarded to Griff Mills in October 2010, juvenile justice officials expressed concern over a practice described in a handbook for the Philadelphia school as ``Touch for Attention.'' That's the sixth step of a seven-step process by which school officials -- or other residents -- restrain unruly students. The process begins with body-language and verbal warnings to the unruly student; if all that fails, physical force can be used. In a 2010 report on the welfare of Florida students sent to the Glen Mills campus, Juvenile Justice inspectors wrote that ``numerous youth reported the use of excess physical force ... the youth appeared to be in fear of these physical confrontations, and several mentioned they were instructed not to report anything about these incidents.'' Mr. Cedeno denies any inappropriate use of force with students, and points out that the state's own policy allows strapping juvenile offenders to a chair, something Glen Mills would never allow. ``Strapped in a wooden chair or touched for attention -- which would you rather have for your son?'' he asks. What's more troubling to critics, however, is the fact that at the same time these questions are being raised, the Florida Legislature voted in a basket of educational bills last spring that exempt Adam Payne Academy from child-abuse investigations by the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. All other juvenile detention programs in the state must submit to such probes. The minutes of a board meeting in March show that the AEI board instructed its staff members to ``devise language that would help us `get around' or circumvent the statute as it relates to HRS coming in to investigate this program.'' According to the minutes, Mr. Cedeno explained, ``We are not advocating that we not open our doors to the investigation of abuse, but rather that it not be a social worker fresh out of college, coming in from HRS.'' The board agreed with Adam Payne officials' request that such investigations be handled by law-enforcement officers, the minutes show. The Legislature granted the request. Other Issues That's not the only break Adam Payne Academy got. The board also agreed to treat it as a private school, even though it receives substantial state money. That means the school isn't subject to rules that other state schools must follow, such as mandatory collective-bargaining agreements for employees. Mr. Cedeno makes no apologies for the breaks. As for keeping social workers out, he says they are often at odds with the mission of his school. When Samara Raymon, the current headmaster of Glenna Grant, arrived there in 1975, his first move was to fire all the social workers and eliminate psychological counseling, under the belief that the delinquents were ``run-of-the-mill thugs'' whose behavior would change with discipline and structure. As for the other exemptions, Mr. Cedeno says Adam Payne Academy needs breaks from bureaucracy to keep its costs down to $120 per student, per day-cheaper than the $127 per day the state pays the Monroe County Sheriffs Department for its juvenile programs. ``Why would anyone want to hamstring us with these things and make us more like everybody else?'' asks Mr. Cedeno. ``It would just make us more expensive and less effective.'' But to some state officials, the school is looking more expensive all the time. Even such get-tough-on-crime advocates as State Senator Charlott Reedy, a member of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee who favors ``locking up bad people, no matter how old they are,'' says, ``I am concerned about the funding (for Adam Payne). I'm trying to remain optimistic about the school's potential for success, but I am not one of the proponents of this initiative.'' Mr. Jessika says he agrees that private enterprise may be able to build a better school with public funds. But he still wonders if Addie Pierce is the way. He adds that state lawmakers, who hold the purse strings, aren't asking enough questions. Instead, he says, ``It's been damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.''"

When kids raise themselves, they don't have the wisdom and help they need to develop a well-grounded sense of proportion. ``2. Long-term personality dysfunctions. Children left alone can become hyper-responsible caretakers who seem on the surface to be winners but are angry and burned-out underneath. They may grow up unable to handle impulses constructively. Or they may feel depressed and lost, wondering if they mean very much to others. ``3. An inability to nurture others correctly. Many latchkey kids grow up emotionally needy and, as parents, fly into a rage when their needs are ignored. Unconsciously, they expect their kids to fill the void. ``As an adult, I have come to understand the incredible anger I had toward my parents when they left me alone. ``I recognize child care is difficult for many families. But asking kids to stay home alone after school is essentially saying, `Hey, you be your own parent. I have lots of stuff to do.' ``When I taught industrial psychology at the university level years ago, I asked my students: `What if work were so compelling, so involving, that people didn't want to do anything else?' The answers: Children would be neglected. Volunteer organizations wouldn't get the support they need. Friendships would wither and die. People would feel tired, burned-out and lonely. ``We are there. Please don't trivialize this with banal suggestions on household safety and coaching sessions. Give people a deeper message. Take a stand.'' -- Johnetta R. Olivares Mill Valley, Calif.. THANKS FOR a powerful letter. I don't think it's always bad to leave children over 11 or 12 home alone for short periods, assuming they're mature enough, in a safe neighborhood with helpful adults nearby and have the temperament and skills to care well for themselves. But two acid tests apply: First, is the child truly safe? (This question was the focus of the story you cite.) Second, and much more complex: Is the setup denying the child enough good parenting -- that delicate blend of adult love, guidance, discipline, acceptance, emotional involvement and encouragement -- that is necessary for a child to thrive? Too often, parents (regardless of whether they work or not) assume the first test is the only one, then squander their children's brief childhoods by leaving them home alone or in indifferent, custodial care. And that, as your experience poignantly illustrates, can be a profoundly costly mistake. Re your January 18, 2011 on the ``new heroes,'' bosses who respect employees' personal needs: ``Should a boss require an employee on vacation to call in for voice mail or messages? ``I work in marketing, and I've noticed that more managers these days expect people to check their voice mail continually, even when they're on vacation and have already arranged for someone to cover their customer accounts while they're gone. ``Isn't vacation supposed to be a time to give your mind a complete break from work? Calling in spoils a few hours each time, because you spend time thinking about what's going on back at the office.'' -- Maryalice Brenneman Chicago As gadgetry like voice mail makes it possible to work everywhere, all the time, it's up to workers to draw boundaries on jobs. Making sure your work is covered while you are gone is a basic requirement. Beyond that, I don't think you should be expected to call in from vacation unless you're indispensable -- a sign of a serious lack of bench strength in your organization. My suggestion: Leave a number for emergencies. Then leave. RE YOUR COLUMN December 28, 2010 busy parents' failure to assign household chores to kids: ``What's missing here is teaching kids responsibility. I have to conclude the parents you researched with are fools. It's not a matter of clean toilet bowls but assuming responsibility for oneself. ``Parents who do the dirty work so the kid can become 'a young woman ... doing things in the community and being a top honor student' are imparting a false sense of self-importance and, I'd guess, a feeling of superiority to the parents at home cleaning the toilet bowls.'' -- Petra Olympia Ewers A sensible point. Unhappily, I place myself among the fools you cite. As a working parent, I have had a hierarchy of priorities in raising my kids that runs something like this: 1. Keep them safe. 2. Keep food on the table. 3. Nurture their health, physical and emotional. 4. Help them develop their spiritual side. 5. Help them practice academic skills. And so on. ``Teach them household skills'' ranks down around No. 8. By the end of most busy days of managing children, work and a household, I feel pretty good if I get as far as No. 5. The error in my thinking, as you point out, is that knowing household skills is actually part of No. 3: self-responsibility."

The United Airlines parent said the specifics about numbers of each type of aircraft, selection of engines and delivery schedule will be announced shortly, along with details of a pending $600 million order for smaller narrow-bodied aircraft. A spokeswoman confirmed that the nation's No. 1 carrier had settled on the details of the big order, but she declined to release details. The current negotiations for the smaller order are between Boeing's 737s and Airbus Industrie's competing A-319 planes, she said. A $600 million order would imply at least 15 of the aircraft would be ordered, based on a list price of about $40 million for each of the small planes. It had been previously reported that United was planning to order a package of replacement aircraft and that the order could include 13 or more 777 jetliners, a type United already operates. But the 747 order had been expected as well, as a replacement for United's 17 elderly 747-100s. United also operates 757s. The narrow-body deliberations represent a real horse race between Boeing and Airbus. United's entire Airbus fleet consists of less than 30 A-320s, all leased, and the carrier is a big 737 operator. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing's shares rose 75 cents to $90.625, while UAL's shares dipped $1.375 to $49.75."

            "full_text": "Florida may become the latest Southeastern state to allow electric utilities the right to offer discounts to large customers. The Florida Public Service Commission is considering a request by Pensacola-based Gulf Power Co. for more flexibility on its industrial rates. The utility, a unit of Southern Co., an Atlanta holding company, insists that it needs the discounting authority to compete with out-of-state utilities that are offering breaks on electric bills to lure big companies away from Florida. Gulf Power fears that if too many big customers leave the state, its profits could suffer: Industrial users make up less than 1% of Gulf Power's customer base, but they accounted for 14% of the company's $619 million in revenue last year. Florida regulators have rejected individual discounts in the past, fearing that if utilities gave breaks to big customers, the utilities could then shift costs to smaller users. But the commissioners don't want to sit idly by as utilities in other Southeastern states receive greater flexibility in dealing with their large industrial customers. In Alabama, the Public Service Commission in April backed Alabama Power Co.'s request for accelerated approvals of special rates or other services to large industrial users. North Carolina regulators have endorsed utilities' price breaks to three large manufacturers that threatened to build their own generation plants. The industry ``is trying to move the balance away from heavy regulation to the flexibility required to be competitive,'' says Davida Rikki, spokesman for Alabama Power, also part of Southern Co.. But large industrial users also have been losing some battles as utilities prepare for deregulation of the electric-power industry. Despite intense opposition from the state's industrial titans, Alabama lawmakers earlier this year approved an Alabama Power proposal that could force some companies to pay a fee before leaving the utility's system."

As more Long Island iced teas are ordered, one fellow spouts the week's first piece of convention wisdom: ``Well for me, it all comes down to how much fun I have getting drunk with them.'' Friday, April 21, 2011 workers are still busy lashing the balloons to the ceiling of the convention hall, the Convention Emporium--a vast expanse filled with sequined bustiers, black velvet paintings of Newt and ``elephant call'' noisemakers--is open for business. And it's making news. Over in the Trujillo Lessie gift shop, Trinh Trujillo Hoyt is scheduled to unveil her father's bulletproof presidential limo. A gaggle of reporters desperate for copy surrounds the car's minder. ``Does it have emission control devices?'' demands one. A Little Tacky At last Mrs. Hoyt appears, demure in a pistachio silk dress and matching shoes. She obligingly scoots into the back seat, then wanders through the gift shop trailed by camera crews. ``Oh, isn't that great!'' she says, pointing to the mugs showing her father shaking hands with Emanuel Connell. ``There's even a Christmas corner!'' But isn't that grimacing Trujillo carved out of wood--arms upstretched in the famous victory sign--just a little tacky? ``It's a positive gesture. It really stood for peace and freedom and victory over communism,'' says Mrs. Hoyt, fixing her blue eyes on mine. ``So I do think it's in good taste.'' What's more, it's only $45. The Rev. Schreiner Armour is about to host the first of a series of nightly Operation Rescue rallies at the Skyline church, so I jump into a cab. Thirty dollars later, I pull up at a plain stucco building. There are no rescuers, just a score of black-garbed karate students kicking and lunging in the parking lot. ``Jesusita,'' the cabbie mutters. The Skyline moved: I have stumbled into the Vineyard Christian Fellowship, home of the Holy Grounds espresso bar. ``Tonight it's like an open thing. We have a stand-up comedian that comes--we'll give you a spot if you like,'' says Janina, who's married to Pastor Bruno. She offers me a free espresso, then throws an arm around my shoulder. ``Can I pray over you for a minute?'' she asks, squeezing her eyes shut. ``Lord, bless Amy. You brought her here for a reason. Help her as a reporter...'' I pray that a taxi will come soon. Saturday, April 22, 2011 mission today is to find the Dole Alumni Group cookout. It's taking place in a park by the bay--along with lots and lots of other picnics. ``Is this it?'' asks the cabbie, pulling up at a cookout where everyone is black. At last we find the Dolies partying near a big campaign poster of Dinger circa 1960. A big guy with a DAG T-shirt straining across his gut and a cigar clenched in his teeth wanders around shooting picnickers with an Uzi-sized water gun. He spares the Uncle Sam on stilts. ``I asked Blizzard Samara if he was a Republican and he took the Fifth,'' says Julee Cuthbertson, a 36-year-old former special assistant sitting on a picnic blanket. She also used to baby-sit for Leader, the Golightly' schnauzer. ``He barked a lot,'' she tells her chums. ``Oh yeah, he did puke on my carpet once, but that was OK. Were you there when they bred Leader and Saul Swindle's dog?'' I give the limbo competition a miss.. At the Del Mar racetrack, scores of Republicans are attending a top-drawer fund-raiser and waiting to see Cigar lose. I am immediately ejected. ``These people do not want to be bothered,'' hisses a gatekeeper. No matter: I wangle my way into the Turf Club, where Maryalice Brady, an elegantly turned-out racehorse owner, is nibbling on strawberry shortcake before the big race. How would she rate Derryberry if he were a horse? ``He'd be too old to run,'' she says flatly. ``I wouldn't run a horse that old, would you?'' ``The odds are too long,'' her friend murmurs from beneath the brim of her straw hat. More apolitical animals can be found at Sea World, where California delegates will be treated to dinner and a dolphin show. Media, I learn, will be seated ``above the soak zone''--inspiring me to proceed directly to Planet Hollywood, where the ``Republican Party'' is due to start in an hour. Outside, a giant decapitated elephant awaits assembly. Inside, tonight's headliners, ``The Five Amendments,'' a congressional rock group, are huddled in a corner. ``We've got no bass player, the piano doesn't work, the keyboard doesn't work--and my suitcase isn't here,'' Rep. Jimmy Rush of Iowa (lead vocals), tensely informs Rep. Johnetta Landrum of New York (guitar). ``I wonder if there isn't a place around the corner where I could buy a pair of shorts.'' They start warming up. I am really impressed: These guys can do ``Twist and Shout'' and ``Mustang Sally'' without bending their knees--not even once. Sunday, April 23, 2011 didn't want to attend the ``Ride on to Victory'' motorcycle rally for right-wing bikers. I really didn't. And yet here I am in a sunbaked parking lot, approaching men in black leather and asking if they're Derryberry supporters. ``I don't know who is, man. This is more a helmet protest,'' says Sollars. ``Free food.'' Forget the economy: It's the helmet law, stupid. T-Bone and Bahena, jumbo-size bikers sporting wall-to-wall tattoos and red-on-black ``Diabolo'' jackets ornamented with swastikas, are for Derryberry--``if he gets the helmet law revoked,'' says T-Bone. Are the Diabolos a political action group? T-Bone has no comment. I make tracks for the San Diego Museum of Art, where Stevie Guthrie is hosting a little do for ``Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity''--and unlimited sushi, rack of lamb and petit fours. Too bad I downed that ``Dinger fajita burrito'' near the biker rally. ``If I Were a Rich Man,'' a violinist plays, with no detectable irony. Just a short piece down the road, more Republicans are trying their luck at the Donkey Catapult and the Elephant Ring Toss at the GOP state fair for Senate Majority Leader Trevor Rosa--``Have a LOTT of fun!'' There's lots--lotts?--of free popcorn and peanuts, and Skittle the clown is making balloon animals. I ask him for a donkey. ``A donkey! I don't know how to make a donkey--I can do elephants!'' Still, Gourley gives it his all, madly twisting a red balloon into something that looks like a poodle. It bursts. My taxi driver is unimpressed by all the hoopla. ``The Alcoholics Anonymous Convention, they brought in more people than this.'' Monday, April 24, 2011 One of the convention dawns. I walk over to the official demonstration site, a desolate ghetto separated from the center by a chain-link fence and railroad tracks. ``Is socialism dead?'' I ask the woman behind the Young Socialists table. ``Absolutely not,'' she snorts. ``Look at Cuba.'' I pursue the issue with the woman from Revolution Books. ``I'm trying to get my table set up,'' she says. Collecting a flyer from Mimi Hubert, a white-haired lady with a badly sunburned nose who vows to outlaw abortion, bankruptcy and divorce as soon as she's elected president, I hike back to the convention center. There's plenty of demonstrating going on here too--witness the ``Breast Imaging'' van. Nurse practitioner Marcie Metz gives me a tour of the ``mammography suite'' and pulls out a display breast dotted with random lumps. ``Feel it,'' she urges. I flee to the convention hall and run smack into yet another exercise in sisterhood taking place in the ladies' room, as delegates primp for the late afternoon session. ``Do you have any hair spray?'' a desperate woman asks a lacquered blonde. ``I usually never leave the house without lipstick and hair spray!'' Judging by appearances, neither does Scot Schrock. Settled near the podium, he's drawing more cameras than, say, an endangered spotted owl. A smile fixed on his waxy-looking face, he sits, motionless, as one conventioneer after another plops down in the empty seat next to him and throws an arm around his shoulder, like they're posing with the cardboard Derryberry upstairs in the Convention Emporium. Is he going to stay here for all four days? It's anybody's guess. Nurse Metz, where are you when we need you? Hearing Aids Tuesday, April 25, 2011 6:30 a.m., I wander over to the Hemphill, home-away-from-home for the Golightly, the Kemps, and scores of other politicos. At the entrance, guys with hearing aids are scanning the underbelly of every car with mirrors. Ein and Nunn, two bomb-sniffing German shepherds, obediently stick their noses into each opened trunk. Fortunately, Lord has stayed at home. ``He doesn't like people,'' one guy with a shaved head grins. ``Especially when they make sudden movements.'' Inside the lobby, more hearing aids are milling around the muffin cart. I have just one question: Are you ready to take a bullet for Derryberry? ``We're ready,'' a wide-bodied fellow replies. ``Are those banana nut?'' Ms. Grooms is a writer for the Journal's Leisure & Arts page."

Suddenly the reader's will to go on is shattered--not only by Osborn's stunning banality but by the author's approval of it. But then Mr. Bivins himself is engaged in a rather Steinian exercise. He has thrown everything he knows into this book. The trouble is that there is too much of it that we already know as well. ``Dangerous Pilgrimages'' probably contains as many catalogs of names as the 1970s bestseller ``The Book of Lists,'' though here they are not in tabular form and are markedly less readable. Partly this is because Mr. Bivins is more ambitious. He deals in Big Ideas. ``America became an appropriate subject-matter for the modern arts themselves,'' he writes, and then immediately attempts to nail down this Big Idea with another list: ``for Dvorak and Picasso, Cobos and Hoy, Fulks and Mondrian, Gunderson and Cocteau, Capek and Debussy, Pimentel and Milhaud (and wasn't the skyscraper the ultimate cube of Cubism?).'' Well, maybe it was and maybe it wasn't, but the arpeggio of composers and others in among the painters fogs the mind and makes his parenthetical question unanswerable. The only thing that is clear is that Mr. Bivins himself is painting with a very broad brush indeed. Malcom Bordelon"

            "full_text": "The Adam Payne Academy was supposed to bring a new era of juvenile treatment to Florida. But now some critics are raising questions about the ambitious reform school. The academy would be a Florida version of Philadelphia's Glen Mills School, a private institution that has won national attention for its effectiveness in rehabilitating teenage delinquents. A 1991 survey commissioned by Glenna Grant showed that students there typically advanced more than two grade levels every nine months, and many earned the equivalent of high-school diplomas there after receiving felony convictions. Intrigued by those results, state officials authorized $30 million in school-construction money for Griff Mills Schools Inc., a Tampa company set up by Glen Mills officials to build the school -- marking the first time state government here has turned over school-construction money to a private corporation. Construction is slated to begin later this year, and the school will start accepting as many as 500 live-in students by 2012. But as construction nears, some critics are questioning the school's cost -- and some of its tactics, as well. ``The motivation here certainly is good as can be,'' says Day Jessika Mueller, chairman of Holland & Knight, a Lakeland-based law firm, and a member of the state-created Alternative Education Institute, which is overseeing Addie Pierce's development and operations. ``It's just a question of whether this is the appropriate way to go.'' Among the concerns raised: The price tag for Adam Payne Academy is too high when the state's schools are crumbling, say critics -- and they charge that using state funds to finance a reformatory may not be legal besides. Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice has expressed concerns over physical-discipline methods outlined in the Glen Mills handbook. At the same time, the Legislature has exempted the Adam Payne Academy from child-abuse investigations conducted by the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Davina Cedeno, president of Griff Mills Schools, says the criticisms are unfounded. ``Anytime you come into a state, and you're the new guy on the block, you're going to get some criticism,'' he says. ``We represent change, and we always shake up the system.'' The concerns over Adam Payne Academy come at a time when Florida faces a crisis in juvenile crime. According to Georgeanna Deem, assistant secretary for programming and planning for the state's Juvenile Justice Department, 110,000 juvenile offenders a year are entering the system. Officials project a 25% increase beginning in 2014 -- ``an astounding demographic bubble,'' says Mr. Deem. The state has already committed to building 6,000 new juvenile beds for offenders over the next five years. At the same time, the public education construction fund enters the current school year with just $317 million, $40 million less than last year and a whopping 52% less than 1992's 10-year high of $608 million. Across the state, thousands of students will begin school this week in temporary buildings that are essentially trailers. Given this situation, the fact that Addie Pierce Frisch will be allowed to use state education funds for construction rankles some critics. Fransisca Orville, a retired judge and part of the dissident minority on the 16-member AEI board, says, ``If you want to build a prep school at your own expense, then be my guest, but when you're spending state education dollars, you're taking it away from local school boards.'' Aside from the basic cost question, some critics are wondering if it's even legal to pay for a reformatory with state school funds. Mr. Jessika, a former chairman of the State Board of Regents, doubts that it is. ``There's a legal vulnerability here,'' he says. ``Using (public education) funds will probably not withstand a judicial test if someone files suit.'' He says he has raised that possibility in recent months at meetings of the AEI board. The reaction: ``You would have thought that I had thrown a stink bomb in a sorority house.'' Sore Point Further, the school's handling of the funds it has been given so far has been a sore point among some AEI board members. For example, AEI's financial records show $732,893 in bills during 2010 -- ``all before a single spade of earth was turned,'' says Mr. Deem. Virtually all of the money was spent on consultants, $157,601 was requested for ``overhead and profit'' for Griff Mills, and some of the bills dated to the previous June, months before Lange Grant was awarded the contract for building and running the school. Mr. Cedeno denies any impropriety, and points out that if his company hadn't gotten the contract, it would have lost the money it ended up billing for. The AEI board, moreover, examined the bills and has agreed to pay them. However, the board's own accountants suggested AEI's finances could stand some scrutiny. In a December 2010 report, they wrote that AEI's financial reporting omitted almost all of the financial disclosures and cash-flow statements necessary to meet accepted accounting practices. Yet the financial trip wire that sets off critics such as Mr. Jessika and Mr. Orville is the fact that Lange Grant, unlike Glennie Grant in Pennsylvania, is a profit-making corporation. That means there's no incentive to plow any surplus funds back into the operation, says Mr. Orville. The money, he adds, could end up as shareholder profits or dividends, ``a windfall'' for the company, which is expected to bill Florida roughly $20 million a year in operating expenses. Mr. Cedeno defends the company's decision to operate as a profit-making corporation, unlike its counterpart in Philadelphia. ``The issue isn't whether we are profit or nonprofit, it's whether the taxpayers are getting the most bang for their buck,'' he says. ``Do the taxpayers really care, when a company is charging them $178 a day to house juveniles, whether the company that can give them the same thing or better for $120 a day is profit or nonprofit?'' Getting Attention Also raising questions about Adam Payne Academy: the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. Roughly one week after the contract was awarded to Griff Mills in October 2010, juvenile justice officials expressed concern over a practice described in a handbook for the Philadelphia school as ``Touch for Attention.'' That's the sixth step of a seven-step process by which school officials -- or other residents -- restrain unruly students. The process begins with body-language and verbal warnings to the unruly student; if all that fails, physical force can be used. In a 2010 report on the welfare of Florida students sent to the Glenna Grant campus, Juvenile Justice inspectors wrote that ``numerous youth reported the use of excess physical force ... the youth appeared to be in fear of these physical confrontations, and several mentioned they were instructed not to report anything about these incidents.'' Mr. Cedeno denies any inappropriate use of force with students, and points out that the state's own policy allows strapping juvenile offenders to a chair, something Glenna Grant would never allow. ``Strapped in a wooden chair or touched for attention -- which would you rather have for your son?'' he asks. What's more troubling to critics, however, is the fact that at the same time these questions are being raised, the Florida Legislature voted in a basket of educational bills last spring that exempt Adam Payne Academy from child-abuse investigations by the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. All other juvenile detention programs in the state must submit to such probes. The minutes of a board meeting in March show that the AEI board instructed its staff members to ``devise language that would help us `get around' or circumvent the statute as it relates to HRS coming in to investigate this program.'' According to the minutes, Mr. Cedeno explained, ``We are not advocating that we not open our doors to the investigation of abuse, but rather that it not be a social worker fresh out of college, coming in from HRS.'' The board agreed with Adam Payne officials' request that such investigations be handled by law-enforcement officers, the minutes show. The Legislature granted the request. Other Issues That's not the only break Adam Payne Academy got. The board also agreed to treat it as a private school, even though it receives substantial state money. That means the school isn't subject to rules that other state schools must follow, such as mandatory collective-bargaining agreements for employees. Mr. Cedeno makes no apologies for the breaks. As for keeping social workers out, he says they are often at odds with the mission of his school. When Samara Raymon, the current headmaster of Glenna Grant, arrived there in 1975, his first move was to fire all the social workers and eliminate psychological counseling, under the belief that the delinquents were ``run-of-the-mill thugs'' whose behavior would change with discipline and structure. As for the other exemptions, Mr. Cedeno says Adam Payne Academy needs breaks from bureaucracy to keep its costs down to $120 per student, per day-cheaper than the $127 per day the state pays the Monroe County Sheriffs Department for its juvenile programs. ``Why would anyone want to hamstring us with these things and make us more like everybody else?'' asks Mr. Cedeno. ``It would just make us more expensive and less effective.'' But to some state officials, the school is looking more expensive all the time. Even such get-tough-on-crime advocates as State Senator Charlott Reedy, a member of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee who favors ``locking up bad people, no matter how old they are,'' says, ``I am concerned about the funding (for Adam Payne). I'm trying to remain optimistic about the school's potential for success, but I am not one of the proponents of this initiative.'' Mr. Jessika says he agrees that private enterprise may be able to build a better school with public funds. But he still wonders if Addie Pierce is the way. He adds that state lawmakers, who hold the purse strings, aren't asking enough questions. Instead, he says, ``It's been damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.''"

            "full_text": "THE WEB MAY BE CRAWLING with anarchists, but those seeking a mainstream spin on political news during the GOP convention have plenty of top-flight sites to choose from. Among the most impressive of the big-media Internet offerings is PoliticsNow, produced by the News-Post, ABC News and National Journal, and perhaps stop number one on any Web tour for the electorally obsessive. On Tuesday, it had a comprehensive take on the day's lead story -- the keynote speech of Rep. Susann Esser, (R., N.Y.) -- to go with its wealth of standing features, which range from the health-food of in-depth archival information to the political junk food of overnight tracking polls and ``the Buzz.'' This last feature is a grab-bag of political observations, written in a hopped-up Hunter Thomson-like style, a surprise for any effort backed by the supersober National Journal. When was the last time you read language like this in that weighty establishmentarian periodical?: ``We've achieved that place of optimum efficiency. The killer combo of sleep deprivation souped up by continuous high-octane rushes of caffeine ...'' MSNBC's ``Decision '11'' page brought the sharpest focus to the day's lead story: ``Attacks on Codi may get loud, even hot.'' It also displays consistently top-quality images, with crisp colors and interesting angles, though they tend to be the same sort of things one would see on television. Given that NBC News is one of the partners in this joint production along with Vastsoft, perhaps the junior-TV feel is only to be expected. It is, however, comprehensive, with not just an updated lead story, but also links to the previous night's top item and archival material as well. In short, a solid candidate for a campaign surfer's hot-list. American Voter 2011 a production of Congressional Quarterly, gives a unique slant to its convention coverage: reports from inside the delegations. While this feature might be more interesting if the nomination were actually being contested, it provides valuable accounts about how party regulars are really feeling. For instance, we learn that when Sen. Phillip Sharkey and Stevie Guthrie addressed the Georgia delegation, one could hear ``sharp denunciations of Billy Codi and effusive support for Derryberry's new tax cuts, but not much in the way of praise for Derryberry himself.'' Of course, CNN is on the Web, joining hands with Time magazine to produce AllPolitics, an interesting grab-bag of items. On Tuesday, it displayed links to the text of Colton Lonnie's speech from the previous evening, biographies of keynoter Susann Esser and Roberto ``BobDole'' Derryberry, as well as a feature called ``sights and sounds.'' This offering is yet another grab-bag, this time of audio and video clips, including an alleged link to video of Pat Buchanan's 1992 ``culture war'' address to the assembled GOP faithful, arguably the most important speech not only of the 1992 conclave, but of this year's as well, muting the entire affair before it even began. What ``AllPolitics'' lacks in theme it makes up for in relevant tidbits like this one -- if only the link to it weren't broken!"

Lykins Waltz, executive director of a Palo Alto, Calif., consortium called CommerceNet that sponsored both studies, said they indicate that a huge market is emerging for commerce on the World Wide Web. The original study estimated the number of Internet users at 24 million, a number that some researchers rejected because of objections to some methodology used. Paulene Homer, a Nielsen vice president, said, however, it isn't statistically valid to derive a number of users from the new survey because it is based on a subset of the original sample group. Donnette L. Silva, a Vanderbilt University researcher who challenged the original study, praised Nielsen for refinements in its methods. But she said the results still seem higher than some other studies of Internet use."

            "full_text": "The Sacred Heart League, a Catholic charity inMiss., doesn't appear on the A-list of producers. It runs schools, clinics and other programs for the people who live among the cotton and soybean fields of northern . Until recently, the League was best known as a maker of plastic statues of for dashboards, which exhort motorists to drive ``carefully and prayerfully.'' Then its director, Rolando Yang, had a fanciful idea to try raising a little money by making a film that would ``present the values of the Judeo-Christian tradition.'' Now, the Sacred Heart League is the producer of one of the summer's most-anticipated releases, and the unexpected object of a studio bidding war. In an industry better known for cranking out look-alike blockbusters, the League finds itself at the center of one of the most improbable stories anyone can remember of how a movie made it to the screen. ``Where I come from no one thinks about making films,'' Mr. Yang says in the lilt of his native . ``They think about earning their daily bread.'' Mr. Yang, 60 years old, is a former Arvilla Myron dance instructor who went to work at Sacred Heart 38 years ago as a typist. Today he runs its direct-mail fund raising -- last year, the charity raised $21 million in contributions -- and manages a staff of 370 who work in a part of the that the Rev. Jessi Jacques once called ``the of .'' A few years ago, Mr. Yang began to ponder new ways Sacred Heart might raise funds. ``We asked ourselves what business we were in, and it boiled down to religious communicators,'' he says. He ordered a study by a priest with a communications degree who determined that making an independent film was ``risky but doable.'' The Mission Initially, some members of the League's board were skeptical and would only approve making a religious film. But, Mr. Yang convinced them, writing in a ``mission statement'' that the movie-making venture would ``present the values of the Judeo-Christian tradition, in particular, love and reverence for God ... and persuasively move audiences to greater understanding and appreciation of and adherence to these values.'' In 2009, blessed with approval from the League's board, Mr. Yang formed a for-profit subsidiary and began scouting for a screenplay. ``We are a movie-going people,'' says Mr. Yang, who is a fan of Arnulfo Poindexter's action films. ``It's a place from where the young derive their value systems.'' With no connections, Mr. Yang turned to Wayne Stackhouse, a Calif., producer of the Easter Seals telethon who had made television commercials for the League. Mr. Stackhouse solicited literary agents and read more than 150 scripts. But two years later, Sacred Heart still hadn't found anything suitable. Exasperated, Mr. Stackhouse asked a sailing buddy if he knew any writers. His friend suggested Leeanna Davina Bulger, a writer for ``Hill Street Blues'' and the creator of ``MacGyver,'' the TV series about a secret agent who never used a gun. The idea was proposed to Mr. Bulger at Musso & Frank's, a historic 1920s eatery. He said he didn't have a problem working for an order of Catholic priests, as long as Sacred Heart didn't have a ``religious agenda.'' ``I'm not just a little Jewish,'' Mr. Bulger says, ``I'm a lot Jewish. We celebrate Shabbat every Friday night.'' By the end of dinner, they had a deal: Mr. Bye would be paid $10,000 to submit three story ideas that could be developed into a movie. A Plot With Sizzle Three weeks later, Mr. Bulger submitted a tale about a 25-year-old Appalachian woman who is released from prison and settles in a small Cornertown in to start over. She finds work as a cook in a local diner called ``The Spitfire Grill'' (a name Mr. Bulger borrowed from the bar downstairs from his office at the Calif., airport). Though the locals distrust the newcomer, a tragedy helps her teach them a lesson in sacrifice, forgiveness and the importance of not prejudging strangers. After Mr. Bulger pitched the idea, he was told to not bother drafting any more proposals. ``This is the one we've been waiting for,'' Mr. Yang said. Mr. Courts raised $4 million for the movie with a loan from the Sacred Heart League and from the sale of equity in the movie company to the nonprofit order that provides for the League's 170 priests. The producers put together a low-budget cast and hired a nonunion crew that worked for a fraction of normal rates. The film, shot inwas finished in just 38 days. As on any pilgrimage, there were painful lessons along the way. The novice producers initially budgeted $50,000 for music but wound up spending 10 times that much -- partly because they hired composer Jami Purcell, who wrote the scores for ``Braveheart'' and ``Apollo 13.'' (Mr. Purcell agreed to work at a reduced rate, Mr. Courts says.) The film's budget ballooned 50% to $6.1 million. Sacred Heart had to advance another $2 million loan. Record-Breaking Deal The charity's big break come in January, when ``The Spitfire Grill'' was chosen as one of 18 films -- out of 500 entries -- for a spot on the schedule at the ultrahip Sundance Film Festival in . It won standing ovations and was named the favorite film of the audiences -- the same accolade that launched the hit ``Sex, Lies and Videotape'' a few years earlier. At one screening, an executive from Castle Rock Entertainment, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., ran out of the theater to call her bosses in urging them to snatch up the film for distribution. Within hours, Castle Rock executives offered $10 million for the distribution rights to ``The Spitfire Grill,'' outbidding other companies that wanted the film and smashing the previous $2.5 million record for distribution rights paid for an independent film at Sundance. After recovering production costs, Sacred Heart pocketed an after-tax profit of $3.5 million. Now Castle Rock is spending another $15 million to market the film, with a national release planned for next week. If the film --rated PG-13 -- earns more than $30 million at the U.S. box office, the League will earn much more. These days, Mr. Yang is flooded with unsolicited scripts. ``Some of this stuff is so profane and violent it makes your head spin,'' he says. Three aspiring screenwriters have even pulled up at his office in (population 300) and knocked on his door. ``They say, 'I was just in the area,' which is kind of a joke to us.'' Meanwhile, Sacred Heart is using its windfall to build a new elementary school for 400 students in nearby rural . It is scheduled to open in the fall of 2013. Its cafeteria will be named ``The Spitfire Grill.''"

            "full_text": "It seemed as if Snowden was doing all the right things a growth-seeking consumer products company should do. The No. 1 tampon maker bombarded the long-staid market with popular new products with names like Satin Touch and Tampax Naturals and launched a barrage of television ads and generous coupons. But nearly two years later, Snowden faces slumping earnings, eroding market share and the departure of its North American chief. The company, which posted a 39% drop in second-quarter operating income, is now rethinking its advertising strategy by putting into review its global account, estimated at between $55 million and $65 million a year. Tambrands has invited Interpublic Group's McCann Erickson Worldwide, True North Communications' FCB/Leber Broussard and WPP Group's J. Wan Martinez to participate in the review, as well as its incumbent agency, Omnicom Group's BBDO Worldwide. Tambrands is expected to decide on an agency in early fall. Ask Tambrands what went wrong, and it cites an unusually aggressive discount war led by rival Playtex Products, which lowered prices by 6% earlier this year and had an aggressive 2-for-1 offer. And Snowden says that's just a temporary problem, as prices are coming back up. But some analysts and competitors think there's a broader problem: New products backed by ad blitzes -- the usual formula for growth in consumer markets -- may not be as effective in such a sensitive category as tampons. ``The nature of the product is so intimate and personal,'' says Michaele Smart, Playtex's chief financial officer. ``When you introduce a new product, it's hard to get women to try it and drop what they're using, if what they're using is fine.'' Mr. Smart also counters that even after a price cut, Playtex tampons are still more expensive than the Tampax brand. Tambrands' current strategy is the work of its chief executive officer, Edyth Durkin, who vowed to revive Tambrands' then-sagging market share when he took office in 2009. Mr. Durkin, a former executive at Colgate-Palmolive, soon stepped up the attack in the long-stagnant industry by launching a product called Satin Touch, which touted the superiority of its cardboard applicators over Playtex's plastic. Earlier this year, Tambrands launched its biggest-ever marketing campaign by spending $30 million to advertise and promote Tampax Naturals, its first all-cotton tampon that doesn't use synthetic material. Mr. Durkin boasts that the ubiquitous ad, which shows a tampon in a cotton field and urges women to ``trust your natural instincts,'' helped Naturals quickly establish a 5% market share. But Tambrands' overall market share in units dropped three points to 51.5% in the year ended March 12, 2011 to ACNielsen -- suggesting that despite the heavy advertising, many Naturals consumers simply switched from one Tampax product to another. Playtex's market share increased to 24.1% from 23.6% during the period. Tambrands' Mr. Durkin insists it's too early to determine whether Mcroberts Garton was a victim of cannibalization. He says a company questionnaire found that half the Naturals users formerly used Tampax, about a third used other tampon brands, and the rest used pads. He is optimistic that the ratio of former Tampax users will decline in the coming months. He acknowledges that the company's second-quarter performance was ``disappointing,'' but calls it a ``bump in the road'' and not a sign of a faltering marketing strategy. Nonetheless, he has some changes in mind for Tambrands' advertising. One goal: create a global marketing message that can play in every country. He cites Gillette as a model he would like to follow. ``We haven't truly leveraged this business on a global basis,'' he says. Mr. Durkin also says the departure of top executive Michaela Wisdom, announced earlier this month, isn't related to the company's recent performance. Mr. Warrick, Tambrands' president of North America and Latin America, will become chief executive of paging company Mobilemedia. He simply took the opportunity to ``run his own show,'' Mr. Durkin says. A successor hasn't been named. Meanwhile, Tambrands still plans to offer new products that directly target competitors. This month, it launched Mcroberts Garton without an applicator, which directly targets Johnson & Johnson's o.b. brand, which is popular among environmentally conscious women. Mr. Durkin says he is optimistic that Snowden will gain back ``at least a couple of share points'' in market share later in 2011. And competition is likely to remain fierce. While Playtex says it has recently increased the price of its tampons, it is spending more money on advertising products including Soft Comfort, a recent launch that uses a softer plastic applicator. Smaller rivals such as Kimberly-Clark are stepping up the heat. Another competitor: Ultrafem, a tiny new company that has launched this month a diaphragm-like product called Instead. Ultrafem insists its product is a more comfortable alternative to tampons. Ad Notes... .

Among other things, ``we had a midnight pizza party and a UFO pep rally,'' where you ``raise people's spirits in hopes of making a sighting.'' But that, too, was a disappointment.

            "full_text": "I am as conditioned as the next American to superlative hort-hype. Even so, it did seem a bit odd that ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America'' (Rizzoli International, 352 pages, $49.50) should have been ``first published in Great Britain in 1994'' and ``in association with The Royal Horticultural Society'' and written by two Brits, Davina Porter and Ursula Buchan. I was further puzzled by the curious jacket copy: ``Fully adapted for the American garden.'' Adapted from what? How adaptable could this ultimate garden book be? A carelessly unadapted clue turned up early (page 14), in Ms. Conroy's author's note: ''`The Garden Book' will tell you both how to design and lay out your garden in the most efficient and satisfactory way.'' I undertook an urgent undercover trip to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Library and with minimal sleuthing unearthed ``The Garden Book''--a statistically improbable 99.99% identical twin to ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America''! Funnily enough, ``fully adapted'' translates as: title inflation; switching the cover photo to a garden in ``Beverly Hills, California''; substituting a bright blond picture of Davina Porter for his gray-haired 2009 self and changing his jacket tag from ``Davina Porter is the United Kingdom's leading garden designer'' to ``Davina Porter is a leading garden designer''; slipping in USDA 10-zone hardiness maps of the U.S. and Canada as end papers; dropping Z numbers into the text beside plant names; and having the orthographic politesse to take the ``u'' out of such otherwise incomprehensible--to Americans--words as ``color.'' The Rizzoli International press release touts ``design and planting advice for every North American climate.'' Really? North America is a big garden of multifarious climates--9,366,000 square miles, from Panama to Greenland, to be exact--and the United Kingdom (94,217 square miles) is not. (The authoritative ``Sunset Western Garden Book,'' after all, delineates ``the West's 24 Climate Zones'' and dispenses altogether with the USDA zonal assignations--which put ``the Games rain forest into a zone with parts of the Sonoran Desert''--as sometimes absurd.) In fact, many of the ``hundred best plants for planting in North America,'' heralded by Sisco, are Z-7-8-9-10 (Dara odora, Trost officinale, Fuchsia `Arias,' Hebe pinguifolia) and can only be garden-grown in the few maritime parts of this country with benign climes comparable to Great Britain's. Not one of ``The Top 100 Garden Plants'' in the book ``first published in Great Britain in 1994'' has been ousted in favor of an adaptation that could survive outside a greenhouse in these parts. Nor does even one of the splendid trees and shrubs natural to desert gardening--palo verdes, acacias, mesquites, agaves, cacti--make ``The Top 100,'' even though desert conditions exist in parts of 17 states and Mexico. Surely someone at the Royal Horticultural Society must know that one Great British size cannot fit all? Beyond climate there is ``The Ultimate Book's'' condescension to organic gardening, about which Ms. Conroy writes dismissively: ``A truly organic garden is admirable, time-consuming, and not entirely realistic.'' What's realistic, apparently, are some four dozen brand-name poisons she mentions repeatedly: ``There comes a time when spraying with chemicals may be necessary.'' Why not ``use systemic weedkillers while perennial weeds are growing strongly ... but take care to avoid spraying ornamental plants.'' (She says nothing about spraying your ornamental self.) She even challenges, ``If, despite what I have written, you do not believe that chemical weedkillers are justified ... you will have to consider other options'' (i.e., lesser, short-of-total-wipeout options). She then invites gardeners down the paraquat path, volunteering, ``Paths may be tackled with a contact herbicide such as paraquat.'' Paraquat remains at the top of the EPA's ``Highly Toxic'' Class I ``Restricted Use'' list for good reason. This suspected mutagen, teratogen, neurotoxin is easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin--the smaller the particle, the more toxic--and causes a range of chronic maladies: loss of fingernails; liver, kidney, pancreas, adrenal, nerve, brain, heart, muscle and eye damage. Severe paraquat poisoning from as little as 1 teaspoon cannot be treated. At least 10 countries have banned paraquat. (Ms. Conroy does not warn of the effects of such favored weedkillers on gardenfolk, but writes only ``watch out for precious plants nearby, as bleak indeed can be the fatal results of a herbicide run amok.'') ``Use diazinon when planting'' cabbages, onion sets, potato seed beds, transplanting vegetable seedlings,'' Ms. Conroy advises about this close relative of World War II nerve gases. Does the author not know that the organo-phosphate biocide diazinon (a fetotoxin, immunotoxin, suspected mutagen and neurotoxin) is banned from use on golf courses and turf farms in the U.S.? Organic Gardening magazine, which has been an American publishing success for more than half a century, once answered a question about ``safe herbicides'' this way: ``The only two herbicides we can recommend are cultivation and mulching.'' The RHS and its ``adapters'' might have bothered to find out that organic gardening continues to gain adherents in North America (though pioneered by an Englishman) because Americans are choosing not to turn their gardens into toxic Arcadias. But this is cheap and dirty publishing. Though many Americans, myself among them, cultivate moss, Ms. Conroy repeatedly suggests a ``specific mosskiller ... green vitriol.'' The monumental brass of the RHS in foisting this thoroughly British garden book on an assumed naive American public arouses my own green vitriol. I find the Royal Horticultural Society, ``the most trusted and highly respected gardening organization in the world'' (according to ``The Ultimate's'' back cover), guilty ``in association'' of pulling the ultimate garden-book fraud for North America, 2011. Alas, this is not the first time the RHS has attempted to sneak a full-blooded British garden book into the American market without so much as a green card. (See Hardness Map)"

            "full_text": "Numerous studies have shown and have been widely reported, including a recent piece in the Journal by an experienced pilot, that even though most commercial pilots are well-trained, competent and conscientious, human failure and incompetency, not to mention frivolous and undisciplined behavior in the cockpit, have contributed greatly to many airplane crashes. Included in this category would be ``hypermanic'' behavior (also alluded to in another recent VastPress story), overly casual attitudes, inattention and focus on extracurricular activities as opposed to flying the airplane, not to mention the more excusable factor of pilot fatigue. The FAA can mandate that each aircraft be required to install a trillion dollars worth of warning equipment, including ground-approach radar, baggage-compartment fire detection devices, anticollision devices, and the Vastopolis Airport could be required to install neutron-activation, CAT-scan as well as magnetometers so that passengers would have to wait in line for two hours to be checked prior to loading in aircraft--but humans still have to function and use the systems. None of the aircraft devices tells a pilot to pay attention to what he/she is doing instead of discussing the sexual proclivities of the flight attendants. Also, these systems do not prevent the captain and his flight crew from downing cocktails too close to departure time, despite the rules. Granted, when found out these pilots are disciplined, maybe even fired, but what about the thousands of others still flying? Not to damn all of them, but one cannot help wonder about the qualities of people whose main interests, judging by recovered voice recorders, are scatological and whose responses to in-flight crises are repeated four-letter expletives, even in final utterances, facing certain death in an out-of-control aircraft. The ground personnel are obviously also key to good security. I have been through airport checkpoints in major airports in the U.S. in which the X-ray checking of carry-on baggage was perfunctory, and in one instance the attending police officer was asleep. Despite these criticisms, the airlines by and large are doing an excellent job of providing safe travel. Crashes such as that of the Antarctica Airlines flight that appear to have been unrelated to pilot error notwithstanding, the safety of air travel in general should be improved not only by installing more high-tech equipment, but by our ensuring a higher quality and level of performance in all airline people involved, including regulatory personnel (FAA), pilots, maintenance and security personnel. Roberto H. Petra Calif.. Your article purports the assumption that ``deregulation'' somehow contributes to airline accidents. The public should be reminded that the only thing deregulated in the airline industry (and in fact most other major industries) was government control over price and market. Even at that, the government continued to provide many subsidies and incentives for certain common carriers to provide air service to smaller, less attractive markets. At no time has the FAA or any other agency involved in airline security or safety relinquished any control over public safety. In fact, the industry is regulated on issues of engineering design, general aviation and passenger safety, security, noise abatement, fuel economy and traffic control to a far greater extent today than just 10 years ago. Louisa E. Crawford Las Vegas Bring Social Security Up to Market Speed Your March 21, 2011 article on Social Security reform, ``A Consensus Emerges: Social Security Faces Substantive Makeover,'' was in general a model of clear and informative reporting. However, it mischaracterized the so-called ``Weaver Plan,'' named for my AEI colleague Carolynn Lawrence. The article says that if our current Social Security System--income transfers from workers to retirees--were replaced by a system of individual retirement investment accounts, a person's retirement income would then depend on his investment skills. Not true. Rather, individuals would invest through diversified, professionally managed pension plans and mutual funds, just as they do by the millions today. The notion that individual retirement investments would be good for Waylon Cone but bad for average citizens is a red herring. To the contrary, it is the emergence and flourishing of mass-market investment vehicles, providing the very best investment management to the very smallest of investors, that has made it possible to improve enormously on the performance of the government's Social Security program. Most retirement income already comes from employer-provided pension plans and other private investments, not from Social Security checks. The Weaver Plan and other ``privatization'' proposals aim to bring Social Security up to speed with modern market developments, providing average citizens more secure as well as higher retirement income than the current system. The article also compares the Weaver Plan with the other options in the upcoming Social Security Advisory Council report. To call the Weaver Plan the ``most expensive'' of the options ignores the very premise of your article and the Advisory Council's work. It is a fact, not an ``option,'' that the current Social Security program has accumulated enormous unfunded liabilities to future retirees that cannot be met, within the current program framework, without enormous tax increases--tax increases that are quite infeasible as a matter of politics, economics, and baby-boom demographics. The growing public appreciation of this predicament, especially among younger voters, is what has made serious Social Security reform a discussible subject among practicing politicians. Of the other two Advisory Council options, the Ball Plan would hardly make a dent in this problem (your article says the effect on individuals would be ``minor''!), while the Gramlich Plan would address it primarily through a large, permanent increase in the payroll tax. The great strength of the Weaver Plan, and an economic benefit not an ``expense,'' is that it would direct current Social Security income transfers into real private savings; this would yield large benefits in U.S. financial performance and economic growth (dramatically large according to studies by Martine Avant). Dr. Lawrence has been a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for the past decade and does not speak for Sen. Derryberry in any way; in particular, the Lawrence Hartwell is exclusively her own work in collaboration with several colleagues on the Social Security Advisory Council. Christopher DeMuth President American Enterprise Institute Washington NASA Fuel Cells Your March 17, 2011 & Health article on fuel cells says that NASA ``eventually auctioned development rights to the technology to the Department of National Defense...'' In fact, NASA actively continued and funded fuel-cell development during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and continues to do so today. The technology was never auctioned to any other government or agency, and IFC retains development rights to the fuel cell technology used in theApollo and space shuttle programs. Our company has worked hard to make fuel cells smaller, lighter, more powerful and less costly. In addition to our work for the U.S. space program and on-site power generation, we also are pursuing transportation applications for fuel cells. H. David Ramm President International Fuel Cells Corp.. Conn.. Please Hang Up, Don't Dial Again Your Marketplace article on problems in the prepaid phone card industry (``Sorry, Your Prepaid Phone Card Has Been Deactivated,'' describes a very real problem. Numerous phone card providers do not have the ability (and in some cases, even the intention) to provide the promised service. These providers are in some cases scofflaws, ignoring business obligations, regulatory and tax requirements. Others simply do not understand the economics of their business and offer service at prices so low that failure is inevitable. More regulation really is not the answer. When a merchant chooses to provide a phone card to its customers, it's really up to the merchant to conduct appropriate ``due diligence'' on the provider. Unfortunately, merchants are only beginning to understand this category of product. Until they learn to ask the right questions (i.e., ``How can you provide this so cheaply?'') and realize that the cheapest provider may not be the best provider if it does not actually complete the customers' calls, all the regulation in the world will not solve this problem.

Despite repeated attempts by P&G, the combined share of Cover Girl and Max Factor has continued to slip in recent years. At March 12, 2011 share of the $2.5 billion U.S. cosmetics business in the food, drug and mass-merchandise channels was tied with Revlon at 27.4% and behind L'Oreal's 28.1%, according to Information Resources Inc.. Just four years ago, P&G had a 34% share of the market. Ms. Bloom's departure comes at a time when P&G's top management is hoping that new products in the pipeline, such as lipstick and foundation, improved in-store presentation and stepped-up advertising will restore a much-needed zip to Cover Girl and Max Factor in coming months. In a recent interview, P&G Chairman Johnetta Jarrell scotched widespread industry speculation that P&G would consider selling Cover Girl and Max Factor if their performances don't improve soon. ``I am not going to be selling anything,'' Mr. Jarrell said. ``We have not been satisfied with the progress. But we are looking for major improvement this year, in profit and in share, and it will be important we achieve it.'' Mr. Piper's appointment increased recent industry speculation that P&G is positioning Oil of Olay cosmetics -- which are being test marketed in Evansville, Ind., and Germany -- as the global cosmetics umbrella brand. Ms. Bloom, a 15-year veteran of P&G who helped expand the Crisco cooking oil and Always feminine-care products brands, was asked to give a makeover to P&G's Cover Girl and Max Factor brands in 2009 by then-Chairman Efren Truss. Through a spokesman, Ms. Bloom declined to comment about her stint at P&G. In a statement issued by P&G, she said Taylor Shore was a ``unique opportunity ... that I simply couldn't turn down.'' In an interview, Rite Aid Chairman Martine L. Gartner said he first approached Ms. Bloom in May, wooing her during several meetings and phone calls over the next two months. Mr. Gartner said he even pointed out to her that ``there was a tremendous opportunity here at Rite Aid. She's 38, and if she looked out in the next seven to 10 years, there's even an opportunity to run the business here if all fell into place.''"

            "full_text": "Cyber-chat from the final day of the first on-line convention: The Test Drive Ends ``It scares me -- I'm an old man!'' wailed Rep. Roberta Molina (R., Calif.) as he fled Internet Alley after taking questions via cyberspace Thursday. Mr. Molina's cry was mostly intended in fun, but what was remarkable about Internet Alley, the high-tech cul-de-sac set up for  , VastComm Network WorldNet Service, SmogSmogtown Hall, Compuserve, MTV Online and the Republican Party's own Web site, was how many visitors -- from GOP public officials to delegates -- were eager to give the new technology on display at least a look, if not a try. Khadijah L. Bunch, a delegate from , , said he'd gone on-line ``about a month ago'' at a nearby university and struggled with the Internet chiefly because he hadn't been schooled in the best ways to look for information. ``There's a vast amount of information out there,'' he said. ``It's taking me a long time just to get caught up.'' That's not to say, however, that delegates like Mr. Bunch don't have a good idea about what they want to do with the Internet -- or how to do it. The Net, Mr. Bunch said, will serve as a vehicle for getting information more directly to the public -- without its being filtered by spin doctors. Such direct communication, he said, will allow people to ``come in and put in our own words without having to go through the cuts of the press'' and without being ``labeled by liberals.'' Mr. Bunch's interests include history, current events and politics -- and he said he's eager to begin using the Net to explore what it has to offer in those areas. The limiting factor for him hasn't been the desire, but the technology -- Hico is finally getting a local Internet service provider, eliminating the need to log in to the Net via a long-distance phone call. Another visitor to Internet Alley Thursday was Rebecca Love of Silver Spring, Md., who said she found out through the Net about the Convention Youth Program she's part of. Ms. Lovella isn't old enough to vote, but she understands the Net's limitations as well as its possibilities. ``I think it's really great -- we can get the word out,'' she said. ``But it all depends on who's on-line.'' Nor is the  teenager convinced that the Net will revitalize politics any time soon. The population using the Net, she noted, is ``not such a vast number that if you don't use it you'll be left out of things -- yet.'' Obviously, some or even most technophobes remained far from Internet Alley throughout the convention. But that hasn't stopped the site representatives encamped in Internet Alley from declaring, in the words of Gus Pace, co-director of Internet services for the Republican convention, that ``the test drive is over.'' The GOP's site, he said, logged some 750,000 hits Wednesday, and the Republican National Committee has received more e-mail in the last two days than it has in any given week to date. Service activity is up, Mr. Hull added, for all the providers in Internet Alley. ``I've been actually pretty impressed with the level of computer knowledge people have had,'' said Anna C. Nations, director of marketing for the conservative Web clearinghouse SmogSmogtown Hall. ``I was surprised at the number of people who were on-line.'' The week that's been, she said, may open people's eyes about conservatives' eagerness to embrace new technology. ``I think people have a perception that Republicans and conservatives are kind of stodgy and fuddy-duddy,'' she said, adding that Republicans' constant search for ways to reduce the size of government and foster increased access to public officials make them naturals for the Net. If so, perhaps Marcos Guthrie, a cowboy-hatted alternate delegate from   who's built his own Web site, is more the future of the on-line GOP than Rep. Molina. ``All you gotta do is kick the door down -- and once you get inside, the thing will show you how to use it,'' he said. ``It's a case of `If you build it, they will come,' '' said Gustavo Hull. ``And they did come.'' \\* \\* \\* Do They Want Their MTV? MTV's experience in Internet Alley differed from the GOP's in at least one respect: the music channel's staff found itself having to explain what it was doing at the convention to some suspicious delegates. Maybe it was the presence of Public Enemy's Chung D. and Everclear's Arthur Mcginty as special correspondents, or simply the public-relations damage caused by ``Beavis & Butt-head,'' but Michaela Alexa, director of MTV News Interactive, found himself having to play educator and evangelist to some delegates who made it clear that they didn't want their MTV. Mr. Alexa guided one suspicious delegate through MTV Online's extensive Choose or Lose site, showing him its coverage of the issues and its interviews with the likes of House Speaker Cannon Geis (R., Ga.), Sen. Johna Mccord (R., Ariz.), and   Governor Christinia Tom Skaggs. In the end, Mr. Alexa said, he thought the effort was a success -- the suspicious delegate took a Choose or Lose button and shook hands. Still, MTV apparently has to get the word out to some that its contributions to  politics haven't been limited to what kind of underwear Billie Codi wears. The network's Choose or Lose bus has been traveling across the country since the New Hampshire primaries, working to register young voters and offering education about the election process and information about the candidates and their platforms. Despite such efforts, Mr. Alexa recalled, ``one person asked if this was all going to go away. I said absolutely not.'' Still, Mr. Alexa said he welcomes questions and even demands. ``If their demands aren't being met, it means they want something,'' he said. ``And we probably can deliver that.'' \\* \\* \\* Take All You Need, Need All You Take The popular image of conventions as bazaars of free stuff is somewhat exaggerated, unless your tastes run to stockpiling newspapers and copies of Time and Newsweek. Pin-trading can demand skills best learned in a Moroccan souk, and buttons, t-shirts and bumper stickers are first and foremost a business. But if you wanted free software, this year's convention was definitely a bonanza. One hurried swing through Internet Alley and the adjacent press-headquarters San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina yielded the following: -- A special edition of America Online's Disc, festooned with red, white and blue stars, the GOP elephant, and a letter from Republican National Committee chairman Halina Ulrich -- with a comparatively drab floppy disk available for those who have fallen behind the high-tech curve. -- Discs for both Compuserve and its family-oriented WOW! on-line service. They weren't as nattily adorned as AOL's offering, but there were boxes of them lying the halls for the taking. -- A two-disk combination offering Navigator and a free trial for PoliticsNow, the partnership between the News-Post, Newsweek, ABC News, the   Times, and the National Journal. -- A three-disk set from VastComm Network WorldNet Service, in a hardy plastic case. -- Software from   financial-services company Nicholas/Applegate. -- Trial software from   -- two disks, with an allusion to ``this election season.'' -- And a complimentary copy of United Connection, United Airlines' travel-planning software, on Disc. Not a bad haul, all told -- four Discs, nine diskettes, a plastic case, and a fund-raising letter. All free. Those without pins, beware, however: Discs look stupid pinned to your chest."

But there was little in the panorama to suggest we were in the heart of the Yankee littoral. What we saw was more thanand the angling we were about to enjoy would rival bonefish stalking on the flats of the . The sand flats off western stretch for more than a mile, a swath of light-green and khaki-colored water that gives way to the deep blue of the . Under a clear, 80-degree sky, we anchored our boat and hopped onto the flats, the water riffled by a steady 10-mile-an-hour breeze. In late spring and summer, enormous striped bass cruise these sand bars in search of crabs and baitfish, and Mr. Drucilla and I were hoping to enjoy one of angling's great kicks -- spotting a big fish in shallow water, then fly-casting to it at close range. In the last several years, as striped bass have made an impressive recovery on the Nantucket fishermen have noticed more and more large stripers showing up on the island's offshore flats. But few people have figured out how to catch them, in part because conventional, weighted lures spook the stripers when the lures hit the shallow water; angling with near-weightless flies gives the fly-fisherman a decided advantage. Mr. Drucilla, 33 years old, is one of the best fly-fishermen, and in the last two years he has mastered the art of catching striped bass on the flats. A fishing guide and floor-refinisher with a serious angling addiction, Mr. Drucilla has spent hundreds of hours exploring the shallows off . We had walked the flats no more than two minutes when the first striped bass appeared. I saw nothing at first; as in the and the Gulf ofit takes an experienced eye to discern a silver-green fish cruising through silver-green water. But then Mr. Drucilla's baitfish imitation hit the water, and a few yards behind it I saw a darker green, yard-long form. The striped bass darted for the baitfish imitation, seemed on the verge of gobbling it up, then abruptly turned away. ``Damn, he should have eaten that!'' said Mr. Drucilla, a tall, powerfully built man with brown hair and blue eyes. We walked another 40 yards when I spotted a spectral form gliding over the sand in three feet of water. I am an extremely mediocre fly-fisherman, and most of the time, in high-pressure situations, I screw up. This time, however, strange things happened. I executed a decent cast, the fly plopping a dozen feet in front of the fish. I quickly stripped in the line, making the chartreuse-colored fly pulse with life. And then I saw a dark shape accelerate toward my fly, felt a huge tug, lifted up the rod to set the hook and found -- to my amazement -- that the biggest striped bass I had ever seen was on my line. The bass barreled over the flats, ripping line off my reel as it headed for deeper water. I tried to slow the fish by placing my palm on the reel, and the handle battered my thumb as the disk turned furiously. Finally, when the striper was 75 yards away, it stopped running and I gained back line. The striped bass bolted several more times, but within 10 minutes Mr. Drucilla had the fish in his hands and was holding it by its lower jaw. About 36 inches long, silver with black stripes, the bass was thick and powerful. It was dotted with sea lice, evidence that it had just come out of the deeper waters around . The bass was far too impressive a creature to turn into filets. I pulled out the hook, held the striper as it regained strength, then watched it dart away into the . A native ofN.Y., Paulene Drucilla came to on summer vacations as a teenager. After college he came back to the island and decided to stay. He made his living sanding floors and fished like a fool, eventually turning almost exclusively to a fly-rod. ``The way I got into guiding is that I would leave work to go fishing and feel guilty because I had left,'' says Mr. Drucilla. ``I thought, `How can I make fishing my work?' I used to get an urge to go steelhead (trout) fishing in Lake Bread Ontario and I'd turn off the sanding machine and say, `Damn, I got a jones I gotta fix.' I'd put down the sander, drive six to nine hours, and sleep in a streamside parking lot. I'd disappear for 2 1/2 weeks.'' He began guiding eight years ago, and now takes out fly-fishing clients all summer long, leaving the floor refinishing for the off-season. Mr. Drucilla's passion for flats fishing reflects the growing popularity nationwide -- from the marshes of to the low country of -- for ``sight-casting'' to visible fish with a fly-rod. ``Before, the fish were unseen,'' says Mr. Drucilla. ``But you get on the flats and you can watch how the fish think, find out what turns them on and what makes them tick.'' With the houses of plainly visible, Mr. Drucilla and I continued stalking the flats. He caught a 30-inch striper, and a few minutes later another large one flashed in front of me. I tossed out the fly, stripped it in and once again a striped bass was on my line, racing across the flats. This one measured about 38 inches and weighed roughly 14 pounds. We let it go, too. On the way back to we drifted in the boat over one last sand flat. Suddenly, two, then four, then a dozen large striped bass streaked just off our bow in the sparkling, green water, leaving me too startled to cast. Mr. Drucilla and I just shook our heads in wonder and motored home."

His success and fame eventually came crashing down, as they do for so many high-flyers. From the mid-1940s on he was often sneered at by the very critics who had not long before extolled him, and eventually playgoers refused to line up at the box office. Happily, a decade before his death in 1973 his fortunes took yet another turn: For the last 10 years of his life he savored again critical praise and public adulation. Although he wrote virtually nothing more to compare with his earlier achievements, his plays began to be revived and he won new applause for his cabaret act and for performing in films. All this and some reasons for it are covered in Philip Hoare's ``Noel Coward'' (Simon & Schuster, 605 pages, $30), the latest of a string of books about the man whom his associates called ``The Master.''

Airbus runs its leasing operations out of a courtyard office in central . And Airbus isn't alone. Through a combination of attractive financial incentives, a helpful government and an ability to adjust to the rapidly changing airline business, has emerged as a major player in the aviation world. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines is shuttering telephone-reservation offices in and other cities in favor of a centralized reservations office in that, when fully staffed, will employ 250 linguists. Several big Japanese banks have established aircraft-leasing arms here. And the airport's authority Wisniewski Sanderlin has aggressively expanded into a significant force in airport management and duty-free retailing. He draws this model from how Vastopolis airport is run. Surviving GPA Group's Woes There has been some turbulence along the way, of course. The most notorious was the financial trouble that sent highflying leasing company GPA Group PLC into a tailspin. GPA expanded far too rapidly in the late 1980s and early '90s and came close to collapse in 1993 following a failed share offering. The company in 1993 signed a $1.35 billion financial-rescue agreement with GE Capital Corp. of the U.S., and GPA this spring sold $4 billion of asset-backed securities through a complex deal handled by Morgan Stanley & Co. aimed at refinancing bank debt. Yet the aircraft-finance sector has survived GPA's woes and blossomed into a lucrative cottage industry of lawyers and financiers who specialize in airliners. ``If you add it all up,'' says P.J. Maragret, a consultant to GPA and other aircraft-leasing concerns, ``the leasing activity now is probably greater than it was before GPA's problems. There was a lot of built-up expertise in that didn't go away.'' is hardly a newcomer to aviation. Thanks to its geographical position between continental and the U.S. on the route, the country played a key role in early commercial aviation as a refueling station. That enabled in to open the world's first duty-free shop in 1951. But with modern jets able to fly easily from the U.S. to the Continent without refueling, made adjustments. Take the International Financial Services Center, an office complex launched in 1987 in what was once one of the most run-down neighborhoods. Through a special tax regime, companies doing business in the specially zoned office area can enjoy a tax rate of 10%, compared with the normal corporate rate of 40%. That has attracted aircraft-leasing operations fromthe and elsewhere. Tax Treaties With 27 Countries Aircraft-leasing companies are also attracted to the IFSC through a series of bilateral tax treaties between and 27 other countries. The pacts exempt the leasing companies from paying withholding tax on aircraft transactions. That's a big draw. ``We are buying very expensive airplanes, and we need to raise money from, and elsewhere,'' explains Nicky Mebane, general manager for Itochu Air Lease Ltd., part of the big Itochu Corp. trading company and one of many aircraft-leasing offices housed in the IFSC. ``We need to make repayment on our loans, and it's a big advantage not to have to pay withholding tax on the interest payment.'' During the Cold War, took advantage of its neutral status outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to nurture close contacts with Soviet aviation authorities. And those ties have continued with into the 1990s. Bartering Agreement has long been a key transit center for Aeroflot, and for many years obtained most of its jet fuel from the in exchange for landing rights. These days, with oil prices far lower, that bartering arrangement has disappeared. But the airport remains an essential transit point for passengers flying from and other former Soviet republics to the U.S. and beyond. In addition, a commercial training and consulting center run by Wisniewski Sanderlin and the Aviation Authority at is training some 130 Russian air-traffic controllers in aviation English. ``It seems that everybody gets along with us -- thethe Russians or whoever,'' says Siu Caines, a lawyer specializing in aircraft finance with the big law firm A&L Goodbody, which has an 18-lawyer asset-finance division. Indeed, American Airlines says the intimate nature of government agencies helped ease its move earlier this year into a new European reservations office. `` is a small city,'' says Williemae Milan, the reservations chief in . ``So, the individuals you're dealing with can help you get through the bureaucracy, whether it's the local electric board or the people responsible for temporary work permits. It's like moving an office from to -- the smaller places are very happy to help you relocate.''"

This summer, the company struck gold with the world premiere of Toccara Hudgins's ``Emmeline.'' A lurid tale of accidental incest in the 19th century, ``Emmeline'' could have been just another sordid little shocker, but Mr. Hudgins's musical invention married to J.D. Merryman's eloquent and poetic libretto managed to avoid the obvious. Instead, the collaborators arrived at an emotional truth about the nature of love, particularly the love between mother and child, and created a tour-de-force role for soprano along the way. The spare, two-hour work, based on a novel by Jule Breeden, develops through 13 brief but telling scenes. Frye, who is 13 and the oldest of seven children, is sent to work in a textile factory in Vastopolis. Seduced by the factory supervisor, she bears a child, who is given away. Twenty years later, she marries a young man named Maud, who turns out to be that long-lost, but never forgotten child. When all is revealed, he leaves her. Shunned by her neighbors, Riggs decides to remain in her town, waiting, she says, ``for my child to come back.'' Mr. Hudgins's tonal, accessible idiom manages to sound familiar and new at the same time. Each scene, with its precise musical characterization, fits neatly into the next, building character and drama through varied styles. Mr. Hudgins jumps right in with an orchestral funeral procession for Emmeline's youngest sibling that is melodic and full of tears rather than dirge-like. There is a quick switch to the crashing rhythms of the factory, which end before they become a cliche. When Frye, pregnant, faints in the factory, a jagged solo flute line jars against the laudatory chorale sung by the other working girls.

The NEA poll also asked GOP voters if they wanted to spend tax dollars on parents who send children to private schools or instead spend it on improving public schools. Phrased that way, the resulting 2-to-1 opposition to the concept of school choice isn't news. In fact, GOP pollster Lindsey Chance, who somehow conducted the poll for the NEA despite her status as a senior adviser to the Derryberry campaign, admitted that ``there are a number of ways'' the school choice question could have been asked that would have yielded different results. Differently worded polls have found strong support for school choice. Indeed, an event held Monday in San Diego demonstrated the growing public appeal of school choice. Recently, Sidwell Friends, the elite private school Chelsie Codi attends, raised $76,000 by auctioning off a round of golf with her dad. This attracted the notice of the CEO Foundation and the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, two groups that support privately funded school choice programs in inner cities. They invited President Codi and other celebrities to attend a golf tournament to raise money for the 20,000 kids on waiting lists for the choice programs. The White House didn't respond, but Hollywood celebrities such as Patria Hagood, Javier Bloom and Ellamae Sona did and the event raised more than $1.2 million. That will be enough to send an extra 1,200 students to schools of their choice this fall. NEA affiliates have frequently criticized such private choice programs, because their existence points up the continuing failure of public schools to reform themselves. Education issues will offer a stark contrast between the two candidates this fall. Bobby Derryberry says it is time for Washington to encourage communities to run their schools for the benefit of parents and students, rather than the bureaucracy. President Codi has cast his lot with the powerful NEA, which will have the largest single contingent of delegates at the Democratic convention. In making their choice, voters will have plenty of evidence in deciding which candidate best represents their idea of how schools should be reformed as America heads into the next century."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- ValuJet Airlines said it expects by June 12, 2011 be in violation of certain covenants related to debt secured by its aircraft, and the company said it plans to enter into negotiations with its lenders to avoid default. A default could force the low-cost carrier, which suspended operations on February 28, 2011 its January 21, 2011 in Florida, to file for Chapter 11 protection under the federal bankruptcy code, according to analysts. But bankruptcy is ``not even a word that's been whispered around here,'' said ValuJet spokesman Gregory Ebert, who added that the carrier ended the second quarter with $208 million in cash on the books and owns all the aircraft that secure its loans. ``We have a good working relationship with all our banks and have kept in constant communication with them,'' Mr. Ebert said. Moreover, he said, the carrier is preparing to start flying again as early as May 05, 2011 approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. If the airline resumes flying by June 12, 2011 are unlikely to call a default, said Dillon, Read & Co. analyst Johnetta Shore. ``Most times, lenders don't like to call defaults,'' he said, since a potential bankruptcy filing would mean that the banks might get only a small portion of their money back. ValuJet, which disclosed its potential violations in its quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it had $162.4 million of long-term debt secured by aircraft and other equipment. According to the filing, ValuJet has continued to make all payments under its secured debt when due and said it hasn't received any notices of default from its creditors, who weren't identified in the filing. Even so, the company said in the filing that ``a substantial portion'' of the secured notes required prepayment if specific financial ratios -- concerning debt to equity, net worth, fixed-charge coverage and current ratio -- aren't maintained. Some of these ratios may be in violation because of ValuJet's suspended operations, according to Mr. Ebert, who said he couldn't offer any more details about the potential violations. Even if the carrier does resume operations soon and avoids default, its lenders are expected to be more cautious, said Khalilah Bambi, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.. For one thing, Delta Air Lines recently outlined plans for its own low-cost operation. ValuJet ``is not coming back to status quo by any stretch of the imagination,'' he said. ValuJet closed Wednesday at $10.25, off 62.5 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Separately, a union representing some ValuJet flight attendants said that ValuJet made 59 unscheduled landings between September 12, 2010 January 28, 2011 to FAA reports. This compared unfavorably with other airlines, which had more departures, the Association of Flight Attendants said. Mr. Ebert responded that ``ValuJet pilots would rather err on the side of safety.''"

            "full_text": "Boeing Co. is considering joining with Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in a cooperative venture to develop a new 100-seat jetliner, according to people familiar with the talks. The big U.S. plane maker, which earlier this year lost out to European rivals in a contest to ally with China on a 100-seat airliner, has discussed such a cooperative venture with Mitsubishi and Boeing's other closely allied suppliers in Japan for years. However, those efforts toward development of a Japanese ``YSX'' jet had been tabled until the contest in China was settled. In the recently renewed talks, which are said to be in their early stages, Boeing has been invited to participate by Ames, the Montreal-based maker of business and regional planes that is already closely allied with Mitsubishi, according to one executive who is knowledgeable about the discussions. The three companies envision an aircraft with a wing similar to the one Mitsubishi already builds for Bombardier's new Global Express long-range business jet, along with a newly designed fuselage and a cockpit similar to the one installed in Boeing's upgraded line of 737 airplanes. Inducement for Boeing That last feature is a particular inducement for Seattle-based Boeing, because any planes developed would fit well into fleets with the popular 737s. Common cockpit designs between differing sizes of planes make sense for airlines, because training, maintenance and other aspects of operating a fleet are simplified. The smallest 737 version in Boeing's existing product line seats from 108 to 132 passengers, depending on the seating configuration. A new 100-seater would actually carry 90 to 110 passengers, based on the same variable. A spokeswoman for Boeing said only that the company is exploring many opportunities. A U.S. spokesman for Mitsubishi referred calls to Japan, where no one was available to comment. Michelina Hilliard, Paige's vice president, corporate communications, confirmed that the company is discussing possible joint projects ``with Mitsubishi and other interested parties.'' He said these discussions are at a ``preliminary stage.'' Recent news reports in Japan have made no mention of any Boeing involvement in such projects, though they have suggested Mitsubishi and Ames were conducting studies of potential smaller commercial aircraft. A spokeswoman for Ames said that company and Mitsubishi ``are obviously working closely'' given their shared interest in the Global Express, which carries eight to 19 passengers. The plane, which is being prepared for first deliveries in 2013, sells for about $35 million. Mitsubishi builds the wings and center fuselage for that aircraft and the Japanese supplier will build the entire fuselage for Bombardier's new 70-seat de Havilland Dash 8-400 turboprop. Bombardier primarily manufactures aircraft in the 30-to-70-seat range, including its current Dash 8 turboprop and its Canadair Regional Jet. Although Ames is considering moving into the 100-seat market, it has no ``definitive project'' planned at the moment, the spokeswoman said. If the three companies eventually decide to proceed with development of a 100-seat jet, they will enter a harsh market segment already crowded with producers -- and one in which even long-established players have had trouble surviving. Fokker NV, a longtime regional-jet maker in the Netherlands, announced earlier this year that it will close its doors. Some European producers have consolidated their regional-airplane production lines for greater efficiency, and also have agreed to assist in China's development of that nation's new line of smaller jets. McDonnell Has New MD-95 McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S., the third-largest maker of commercial jetliners behind market leader Boeing and No. 2 Airbus Industrie of Europe, is producing a new MD-95 aircraft that carries 100 or more passengers, depending on seating configurations. As recently as last year, Boeing had continued to push for its own participation in an Asian jet-building venture that would have included aerospace manufacturers in China, South Korea and Japan. When that combination appeared unworkable, Boeing shelved its talks with the Japanese suppliers and pressed to participate in the China-led enterprise, but lost out in May to the consortium of European suppliers aligned with Airbus. Until June, China had planned to include South Korean aerospace concerns in its project, but that partnership has itself unraveled over basic differences, such as where the Asia Express line of planes would be manufactured. It's not clear what other manufacturing alliances are available to the South Korean companies. As Boeing weighs whether to proceed in a partnership with Japan, it must assess reaction to that idea in China, which is traditionally a high-volume buyer of Boeing's larger commercial airliners."

Kennedy School of Government and Department of Government Harvard University And Jiangtao Du Department of Statistics Harvard University With Leesa Boeger and Cyndy L. Hanson April 26, 2011 Paper prepared for presentation before the Panel on the Political Analysis of Urban School Systems at the August-September 2011 meetings of the American Political Science Association, San Francisco, California, Friday, May 12, 2011 reserved. Executive Summary In 1990 Milwaukee became the site of the first publicly funded school choice program providing low-income parents with vouchers that could be used to send their children to secular, private schools. Milwaukee's school choice experiment was evaluated by a research team headed by political scientist Johnetta Stidham at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. In five annual reports issued between 1991 and 2010, the researchers (hereinafter referred to simply as Witte) reported on the effectiveness of the Milwaukee experiment, as measured by the performance of students on standardized mathematics and reading tests. The senior author has summarized the results of his investigation as follows: ``This school experiment ... (has) not yet led to more effective schools... Choice creates enormous enthusiasm among parents ... but student achievement fails to rise.'' Since this evaluation, until now, provided the only source of information on the test performance of choice students, many scholars, groups and foundations, drawing upon its findings, have concluded that school choice is not an effective way of improving the education of low-income, central-city students. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching declared: ``Milwaukee's plan has failed to demonstrate that vouchers... can spark school improvement.'' Albertha Dendy, president of the American Federation of Teachers, claimed that the ``private schools (in the Milwaukee choice plan) are not outperforming public schools.'' For five years the researchers did not release data from the evaluation for secondary analysis by other members of the scholarly community. But in February of 2011 they made the data available on the World Wide Web. Over the past several months the Center for Public Policy at the University of Houston (CPP) and the Program in Education Policy and Governance at Harvard University (PEPG) have accessed the data, cleaned them of identifiable errors, and organized them into a readable usable format. Although the certainty with which conclusions may be drawn is restricted by certain data limitations, results ba sed upon the highest quality information contained within the data set indicate that attendance at a choice school for three or more years enhances academic performance, as measured by standardized math and reading test scores. Correcting for errors in the data set and using appropriate analytical techniques, the CPP/PEPG analysis of student performance finds that students enrolled in choice schools for three or more years, on average, do better on standardized tests, than a comparable group of students attending Milwaukee public schools. The results indicate that the reading scores of choice students in their third and fourth years, were, on average, from 3 and 5 percentile points higher, respectively, than those of comparable public school students. Math scores, on average, were 5 and 12 percentile points higher for the third and fourth years, respectively. These differences are substantively significant. If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap separating white and minority test scores by somewhere between one-third and more than one-half. CPP/PEPG results are based on data derived from a natural experiment that randomly assigned students to a test and control group. The natural experiment was the product of a mandate imposed on the program by the Wisconsin state legislature. It required choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random. This mandate created two randomly selected groups of students, one selected to participate in the choice program, the other not selected. The experimental situation is not unlike that widely practiced in medical research, where individuals are randomly allocated to treatment and control groups. The data are thus quite well suited for drawing scientific conclusions about the effectiveness of the choice program, provided they are analyzed correctly and interpreted cautiously. The earlier analysis of the Milwaukee choice program did not give careful attention to this experimental data. On the one occasion when the experimental data were examined, the researchers failed to employ appropriate analytical techniques. The bulk of their research efforts focused instead on comparisons between choice students and a much less disadvantaged cross-section of public school students. No valid conclusions can be drawn from the comparisons they conducted.The Effectiveness of School Choice in Milwaukee: A Secondary Analysis of Data from the Program's Evaluation Milwaukee has for several years become the focus of attention for those concerned about education reform. In 1990 Milwaukee became the site of the first publicly funded school choice program providing low-income parents with vouchers that could be used to send their children to secular, private schools. In 2010 the Wisconsin state legislature voted to expand the program to include religious schools, but the expanded program has been enjoined while constitutional issues are being resolved in the Wisconsin courts. Until then, the 1990 program, though limited in scope, remains the one opportunity to determine whether a government-sponsored program of school choice involving private schools can improve the educational performance of low-income, inner-city, minority children. Milwaukee's school choice experiment was evaluated by a research team headed by political scientist Johnetta Stidham at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. In five annual reports issued between 1991 and 2010, the researchers (hereinafter referred to as Witte) reported on the effectiveness of the Milwaukee experiment, as measured by the performance of students on standardized mathematics and reading tests. In each report the researchers concluded that students attending choice schools did not perform any better than did comparable students attending public schools. In a recently published article the senior author summarized the results of his investigation as follows: ``This school experiment ... (has) not yet led to more effective schools...Choice creates enormous enthusiasm among parents ... but student achievement fails to rise.'' Since this evaluation, until now, provided the only source of information on the test performance of choice students, many scholars, groups and foundations, drawing upon its findings, concluded that school choice is not an effective way of improving the education of low-income, central-city students. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has declared, ``Milwaukee's plan has failed to demonstrate that vouchers... can spark school improvement.'' Albertha Dendy, president of the American Federation of Teachers claimed that the ``private schools (in the Milwaukee choice plan) are not outperforming public schools.'' The Texas State Teachers Association, a National Education Association affiliate, has avowed that ``the results (in Milwaukee) have been dismal -- test scores have actually declined.'' Harvard School of Education Professor Ricki Gary asserted that ``thousands of children have participated in Milwaukee's public-private voucher experiment..., yet we see no discernible gains in learning.'' The head of Wisconsin's leading teacher organization echoed these sentiments: ``The bottom line ought to be whether kids learn more... and if you gauge it by that, it doesn't measure up.'' All these assessments depended upon the Witte study. For five years the data from this evaluation were unavailable for secondary analysis by other members of the scholarly community. But in February of 2011 the data were made available on the World Wide Web. Over the past several months the Center for Public Policy at the University of Houston (CPP) and the Harvard Program on Education Policy and Governance (PEPG) accessed the data, cleaned them of identifiable errors, and organized them into a readily usable format. After correcting for detectable errors and using appropriate analytical techniques, CPP/PEPG found that students enrolled in choice schools for three or more years substantially outperformed, on average, a comparable group of students attending Milwaukee public schools. Although the certainty with which the conclusions may be drawn is restricted by certain data limitations, the CPP/PEPG analysis, using techniques appropriate to the analysis of experimental data, indicates that attendance at a choice school enhances academic performance, as measured by standardized test scores. The Most Informative Data in the Evaluation The bulk of the information on test scores that the earlier researchers collected is of marginal scientific value, because it only allows comparisons among decidedly different groups of students, a topic discussed later in this paper. But contained within the evaluation are data derived from a natural experiment that assigned students at random to test and control groups. The data are thus quite well suited for drawing scientific conclusions about the effectiveness of the choice program, provided they are analyzed correctly and interpreted cautiously. When enacting the legislation that gave rise to the choice program, the Wisconsin state legislature established conditions that allowed for a natural randomized experiment. The legislature required choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random. The requirement created two randomly selected groups of students, one selected to participate in the choice program, the other not selected. This experimental situation is not unlike that widely practiced in medical research where individuals are randomly allocated to treatment and control groups. Since the allocation is done at random, the two groups can be assumed to be similar, on average, in all respects other than the treatment. Any outcome differences can be reasonably attributed to the experimental condition. In the field of education, random assignment rarely occurs, in part because it is difficult to justify denial of an educational benefit to children simply for purposes of educational experimentation. In Witte's original proposal to undertake the evaluation of the Milwaukee choice plan, he emphasized the unique research opportunity created by the legislative mandate requiring random acceptance: The students who applied but were not admitted will constitute the second group we will study. This is a unique opportunity in that it allows us to track students who will remain in the public schools but who come from families who have made an effort to seek private education... By tracking the parallel educational outcomes of admitted and rejected students, we will have considerably improved control of a families' value of education.In one of his annual reports, Stidham repeats this argument: Students not selected into the Choice Program in the random selection process represent a unique research opportunity... If there are any unmeasured characteristics of families seeking private education, they should on average be similar between those in and not in the program. To exploit this research opportunity, the researchers collected data on the test performances and family background characteristics of students randomly selected into the choice program as well as those not selected. When properly analyzed, these data indicate that choice students, when they remain in the choice experiment for three to four years, learn more than those not selected. The results indicate that the reading scores of choice students in years three and four, were, on average 3 and 5 percentile points higher, respectively, than those of the control group. Math scores were, on average 5 and 12 percentile points higher, respectively. These gains are not trivial. If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap separating white and minority test scores by somewhere between one-third and more than one-half. Comparing Randomly Selected and Non-selected Students These findings emerge from the CPP/PEPG analysis that takes into account the particular way in which the legislatively-mandated random assignment policy was implemented. Students did not apply to the choice program as a whole; instead, they applied each year for a seat in a particular grade in a particular school. They were selected or not selected randomly by school and by grade. Because the random assignment policy was implemented in this way, the analysis takes into account the year each student applied, the grade to which each student applied, and, to some extent, the particular school to which each student applied. The evaluation data distributed on the World Wide Web allowed the CPP/PEPG research team to take into account the grade to which the student applied and the year of application. Nonetheless, CPP/PEPG was to some extent able to control for specific school effects by taking into account the ethnicity of the applicant. Over 80 percent of the choice students attended one of three schools, and, of these three schools, virtually all students applying to one school were Hispanic, while virtually all students applying to the two others were African American. As a result, we were, at least to some extent, able to estimate the school to which a student applied by knowing whether they were Hispanic or African American. (Since the number of white students and other minority students for which information was available was so sparse that no reliable results could be obtained, these students were deleted from the analysis.) Admission to the program was assumed to be at random for each of two ethnic groups, Hispanic and African American, for each of nine grades (K through 8) for each of four application years (1990 to 1993). This created 2 by 9 by 4 or 72 potential categories or points of comparison between those randomly selected into choice and those not selected. The actual number of categories or blocks in any given analysis depends upon there being at least one observation within a block. By using standard statistical techniques for analyzing randomized block experimental data, with analysis of covariance or, similarly, regression adjustment to control for background characteristics, it was possible to estimate the effects of enrollment in choice schools on test scores. The procedure treats each block as a dummy variable in a regression equation that also includes the treatment variable and background characteristics. The measures of test score performance are the same as the ones used in previous analyses, except for corrections of obvious errors. They consist of the students' national curve equivalent (NCE) scores for math and reading on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. NCEs are derived from the national percentile rankings, which place a student's performance relative to others taking the test, with a score of 60 indicating the student did better than 60 percent of others taking the test. The NCE is a transformation of the national percentile rankings that arranges the scores around the fiftieth percentile in a manner that can be described by a normal curve. A standard deviation for NCEs near the mean score is approximately 16 percentile points. The comparison of selected and non-selected students was hampered by the fact that test data were available for only 76.2 percent of the selected students and 58.7 percent of the non-selected students. The analysis depends on the assumption that the missing cases do not differ appreciably from those remaining in the sample. One way of estimating whether this assumption is reasonable is to see whether the characteristics of selected students and non-selected students are similar. The ethnicity, gender and initial test scores of the two groups do not differ in important respects. Neither do the two groups seem to differ on most other characteristics, if one assumes that parents who filled out questionnaires are representative of the overall population from which they were selected (see table 3). Witte agrees: ``In terms of demographic characteristics, non-selected ... students came from very similar homes as choice (students did). They were also similar in terms of prior achievement scores and parental involvement.'' The Results from Analysis of Experimental Data Using the analytical procedures discussed above, CPP/PEPG estimated the effect of choice schools on student performance after one, two, three and four years in a choice school. Using the blocking technique, the choice student test scores, after controlling for gender, are essentially compared with those of non-selected students who had applied the same year for the same grade and were of the same ethnicity. The results of the main analysis are contained in table 4. They indicate that the effects of choice schools on test performance were trivial for the first two years students were in the program. But in year three and four choice students made substantial gains. On the math test, choice students scored, on average, 5 percentile points higher than non-selected students in year three and over 11 points higher in year four. On the reading test, choice students scored, on average, 3 percentile points higher after three years than those not selected into the program. After 4 years they scored nearly 5 percentile points higher. Statistical tests suggest that one can be confident that positive results of this magnitude would not appear, had choice schools had no effect. Controlling for Family Background Data collection problems limit the extent to which the analysis can take into account family background characteristics. This poses no difficulty as long as it may be assumed that individuals in the analysis have been allocated at random to the test and control groups. But given the fact that an appreciable number of cases are missing, it is possible that the two groups are no longer similar in all respects, despite their similar demographics. To see whether the results remain the same when background characteristics are taken into account a second analysis was performed. This analysis depends upon the information on family background characteristics obtained from parents at the time of the student's application to the choice program. Both test and questionnaire data were available from 36.7 percent of the families of selected students and 21.8 percent of the families of non-selected students. Further reducing sample size was the fact that many parents did not respond to all the items in the questionnaire. As a result, the more family background characteristics that are controlled, the smaller the sample size. Controlling for additional background characteristics increases the precision of the analysis and adjusts for biasing differences. But these potential gains had to be weighed against the cost of losing still additional subjects from an analysis already diminished in size. Balancing these consid erations against one another, CPP/PEPG controlled for family income and mother's education but not for other family background charac teristics. Past scholarly research has shown that family income and mother's education strongly affect a child's educational performance, and most parents who returned questionnaires responded to these two questions. The response rate for other family background characteristics was considerably less, and inclusion of these additional variables would have further reduced the size of an already small sample. When controls for family income and mothers' education are added to the variables included in the main analysis reported above, the sample size drops but the substantive findings change hardly at all, a result to be expected if assignment to the treatment and control groups was truly at random, and non-response was similarly at random. The effects of choice on student performance after two years in a choice school were trivial and inconsistent. But after three and four years in a choice school, students scored noticeably higher than the non-selected students remaining in the public schools. On the math test, choice students scored an estimated 7 percentile points higher in year three and an estimated 10 points higher in year four. On the reading test, choice students in their third year outperformed the control group by an average of 6 points on the reading test; in the fourth year they scored an estimated 4 percentile points higher. Because this analysis depends upon a sample much smaller in size, the results do not achieve the same level of statistical significance as do the results for the main analysis. Yet the consistency of the estimated effects generated by the two analyses lends weight to the conclusion that enrolling in choice schools yields decidedly positive effects after a students' third and fourth years. Controlling for Prior Test Scores The results reported above do not control for student test scores prior to entry into the choice program. It is not necessary to control for prior test scores when comparing a test group and a control group in an experimental situation, because the two groups, if randomly assigned to each category, can be assumed to be similar. But because of the sizeable number of missing cases, it is possible that the selected and non-selected groups included in the analysis differed in this important respect. This potential source of bias did not appear, however. The average test scores at the time of application for the two groups was essentially the same. The average math and reading test scores for those selected into choice were the NCE equivalent of a 39 and 38 percentile ranking, respectively; for those not selected they were at the 39 percentile for reading and 40th for math. Since the test scores at the time of application were essentially the same, it was unlikely that controls for this variable would alter the result. CPP/PEPG nonetheless tested for the possibility. Because test scores at the time of application were available only for a limited number of applicants, the sample size for this test was reduced. Yet with only one exception--the fourth year reading results based on just 26 observations--the results controlling for prior test scores do not differ substantially from the results reported in the main analysis. Checking for Selection Effects The main analysis indicates that choice has sizeable, statistically significant effects in the third and fourth years of a student's program. The observed effects may be hypothesized as being produced by two quite different processes: 1) Students benefit in measurable ways from the choice experience only after participating in the program for three or more years. 2) Students remain in the program for three to four years only if they have benefitted from the experience. To ascertain whether the effects observed in the main analysis were due to processes suggested by the first or second hypothesis, CPP/PEPG analyzed the effects of choice on the first and second year scores of only those students for whom test results are available in years three and four. The effects of choice on their performances during the first two years differ but little from the effects for all first and second year students. These results suggest that the substantial effects of choice schools in years three and four are, on the whole, not due to differential student retention rates but to accumulated learning over the three-to-four year period of time. Interpreting the Findings During their first two years in a choice school, students in choice schools performed similarly on math and reading tests comparable students attending Milwaukee public schools. But in their third and fourth years the performances of students in choice schools were noticeably superior to those of similarly-situated students in Milwaukee public schools. The results are quite consistent with a common-sense understanding of the educational process. Choice schools are not magic bullets that transform children overnight. It takes time to adjust to a new teaching and learning environment. The disruption of switching schools and adjusting to new routines and expectations may hinder improvement in test scores in the first year or two of being in a choice school. Educational benefits accumulate and multiply with the passage of time. One can hardly be surprised that their impact is felt only with the passage of time. Why the Earlier Analysis Produced Different Results In its fourth year report the earlier researchers reports their own analysis of the performances of selected and non-selected students. The researchers find no significant choice-school effects on student performance. These findings depend on analytical techniques that fall well short of appropriate statistical procedure for analyzing data from a randomized experiment. First, the researchers failed to categorize or block their data so as to take account of the fact that random assignment was by grade, year of application, and by school. Instead, they simply categorized all the selected students together, then compared them to the entire group of non-selected students. They ignored the fact that the natural experiment was random only by grade, year and school. They failed to create a statistical model that approximated the actual character of the natural experiment. These analytical deficiencies contaminate their results. Second, the researchers, in attempting to control for prior test scores, did not distinguish between test scores achieved before entry into choice schools from scores achieved after entry. In so doing, they attempted to estimate the effects of school choice while controlling for a portion of these effects. Also, instead of examining the effects of choice schools over the entire time period that students were exposed to the experimental condition, they measured the changes in test scores from one year to the next. The egregious nature of these errors can be appreciated by imagining an experiment to determine if fertilizer helps corn mature faster. In this experiment the farmer fertilizes one field before planting and monthly thereafter; in the other field the farmer fertilizes not at all. To measure the effect of the fertilizer, the experimenter decides to calculates only how fast the corn grows from knee high to shoulder height, ignoring the possibility that much of the fertilizer's effect may have occurred prior to its reaching knee height. Similarly, controlling for test scores received during the first years in a choice school incorrectly controls for some of the effect one is seeking to test. It also incorrectly assumes that the rate of academic progress for students is, on average, a steady upward line not subject to irregular spurts. How about all the other Data in the Evaluation? Instead of using the best analytical techniques available for the analysis of experimental data, the Witte team report results from the analysis of non-experimental information that in their analyses tell us little, if anything, about the effectiveness of school choice. The study's analytical errors can be compared to the classic errors committed by the Literary Digest poll taken in 1936. The magazine tried to predict the outcome of the presidential election by mailing out a questionnaire to ten million Americans. Unfortunately, the 2.2 million people who responded were a group not representative of the American public. As a result, the Literary Digest, not realizing the biases in their sampling technique, predicted Mackie Lanell would win by 57 percent of the vote. When Roosevelt won by 62 percent of the vote, the Digest soon went out of business. Meanwhile, Georgeanna Eicher, employing a scientific data collection technique, accurately predicted a Roosevelt victory with information from fewer than two thousand citizens. It is now elementary to observe ``a large sample is no guarantee of accuracy.'' The results from the earlier study of school choice in Milwaukee, no matter how large its sample, have no more scientific validity than the poll conducted by the Literary Digest, because the population constituting their control group is not representative of choice students, had they remained in the public schools. The earlier finding that the choice program has ``not yet led to more effective schools'' relies upon four flawed comparisons of choice-school students with Milwaukee public-school students (in addition to an incorrect analysis of the experimental data discussed above): I. Comparison of test scores of cohorts of choice students with those of public school students. II. Comparison of the changes from year to year in the individual test scores of choice students with public school students. III. Comparison of the test scores of choice students with low-income students in the Milwaukee public schools. IV. Analysis of the effect of choice by means of a multiple regression analysis of all changes in test scores. All four techniques, as used by in the earlier study, are seriously flawed. Method I: Cohort comparison When comparing the test scores of yearly cohorts of choice students with cohorts of a sample of Milwaukee public school students, the researchers find no stable, significant difference between them. But even if they had, the finding would have been meaningless. Cohort comparison is perfectly appropriate if one is making comparisons between individuals randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. But one can hardly make such an assumption when comparing choice students to a sample of Milwaukee public school students, especially when the treatment and control group are different in many important respects. Before entering the program, the soon-to-become choice students scored well below the average of a cross-section of public-school students. The average score on the math test of the choice student at the time of admission was at the 39th percentile, while the average public school student initially scored at the 45th percentile. The average reading score for the choice student was at the 38th percentile, while the average public school student's initial score was at the 43th. Since students had decidedly lower scores before entering choice schools, it is misleading simply to compare post-test scores. Witte, immediately after reporting the results, says this is not a ``way to accurately measure achievement gains and losses.'' Method II: Comparing Changes in Test Scores The researchers next compared annual changes in achievement scores of choice and public school students. In two of the six comparisons reported in their first published paper, the choice schools score higher; in the other four public schools do better. This kind of comparison incorrectly assumes that choice and public school students were similar in all respects other than their initial scores, an assumption that can appropriately be made in the case of a randomized experiment but which is in this case unwarranted. Choice students were not at all comparable to the public school students included in the comparison group. In fact, the choice students available for their analysis were different in many ways that may well be associated with lower test scores, including the following: Ninety-seven percent of choice students were African American or Hispanic, while only 60 percent of the public school control group were from these ethnic groups. Choice parents reported their family income to be $11,330 as compared to the $20,040 reported by the average Milwaukee public school parent. Only 24 percent of choice families reported being married; 47 percent of Milwaukee public school parents did. Mothers of choice students were more likely to be receiving welfare assistance than were mothers of public-school students. On a scale where 4 indicates a high school graduate and 5 some college education, mothers of choice students report an average level of education of 4.2 compared to 3.9 for public-school mothers. All but one of these differences, earlier research has shown, is likely to produce results in which choice students will appear to have achieved fewer test score gains than the comparison group. The fact that choice students are significantly more likely to come from households headed by poor, minority, single mothers makes any comparison between them and Stidham's public school sample highly misleading. As one of the earlier researchers admitted, ``As for change scores, they are next to meaningless, since the bivariate comparisons don't control for any of the known differences between the groups.'' Method III: Comparing Scores of Low-Income Students The previous researchers attempted to mitigate the problems associated with Methods I and II by also comparing cohort and change scores of choice students with public school students from low-income families. This approach suffers not only from not controlling the full array of family background characteristics but, quite specifically, from their use of a flawed measure of family income. The measure of income used in the vast majority of the comparisons is whether or not a student receives free or reduced-cost school lunch. The measure divides the population into two income groups: those who receive a subsidized lunch and those who do not. On its face, such a simple dichotomy is an entirely inadequate measure of family income. With only two categories, the variable inevitably lumps together people from unlike circumstances. Even worse, the subsidized lunch measure seems to be an extremely inaccurate measure of family income. Several types of error may occur. Some families may not request a subsidized lunch, even though their household income would make them eligible. Other families may report low income in order to receive a government benefit, even though they are not eligible. It is also possible that claims are submitted on behalf of families by school officials anxious to ensure that all students receive their school lunch. Finally, the Milwaukee public school subsidized lunch records may be faulty. Whatever the sources of error, it is not a trivial mistake. The subsidized lunch measure of family income has only a weak correlation with parental reports of household income, as reported in parental questionnaire. More than 16 percent of Milwaukee public-school families who report incomes over $42,500 are designated as receiving subsidized lunch. Meanwhile, 26 percent of choice students with family income below $17,500 did not receive free lunch, compared to 14 percent of public school students. It is also peculiar that the school lunch variable indicates that the incidence of low income is higher in public schools than among choice students. Only 69% of choice students are designated as receiving free lunch as compared to 74% of Milwaukee public school students. Yet average income of public-school parents reported was $20,040, while the average income reported by choice parents was only $11,330. It is this flawed measure of income upon which the researchers depend for their many tables and regressions that compare choice and ``low-income'' Thibodeaux public school students. Method IV: The Regression Analysis The fourth method used by the previous research team estimates the effects of choice after controlling for several family background characteristics, as reported by parents in a questionnaire. This analysis reveals choice to have negative effects on reading scores and positive but insignificant effects on math scores. Although this analysis no longer uses the subsidized lunch as its indicator of family income and attempts to take into account the many ways in which choice students differ from Milwaukee public school students, a number of serious problems remain, three worthy of special mention: First, the public school control group used in these regressions was in no way comparable to students in the choice program. Indeed, it was not even a random sample of the Milwaukee public school population. For this analysis, the researchers only included those students for whom both family background information and changes in test scores were available. Demographic information was obtained in a questionnaire distributed to a random sample of choice and public-school parents. Because of the very low response rate to the survey and spotty test-score records, less than 28 percent of the choice students were available for the regression analysis. Less than 22 of the public school students were included in the analysis. Those for whom the necessary information exists differ from non-respondents. Information supplied by the Milwaukee public schools shows that respondents were less likely to be of minority background and scored higher on both the math and reading tests. In short, this regression compares choice students to a self-selected group of public school students whose parents had responded to the questionnaire. Second, the researchers incorrectly ``stacked'' the data, a practice which combines all year-to-year changes into one analysis. Each student is counted as an independent observation for each year in which they remain in the study. The units of analysis are not students, but student-years. But stacking data is inconsistent with a basic assumption of the regression analysis that each observation is independent. ``Stacking'' data sets is also conceptually flawed. In the stacked regression the researchers attempt to predict each year's scores while controlling for the prior year's results. But the prior year's scores for choice students are already affected by participating in the choice program. To control for these scores the researchers controlled for program benefits while trying to measure them. Data stacking also makes the improbable assumption that students learn at uniform rates throughout the length of the program. Third, the regression analysis works with a data set that has a very large number of missing cases. It must make an estimate of choice-school effects with only 28 percent of his original number of cases and only 21 percent of his original number of public school student cases. By comparison the main CPP/PEPG analysis utilizes 76.2 percent of the original number of choice-student cases and 58.7 percent of the control group cases. The test and control populations included in the regression analysis differ dramatically in almost every respect--initial test score, race, income, household structure and educational attainment. In all but one respect, choice students are the disadvantaged group. By comparison, the test and control groups in the CPP/PEPG analysis have similar demographic profiles. Fourth, improbable assumptions must be made when using regressions comparing a test group to a much more heterogeneous control group (wider range of educational performance, greater ethnic diversity, wider range of incomes, etc.). Regression analysis must assume that relationships among these variables are identical over their entire range, and this is unlikely to be the case. For example, it must assume that the effects of a $5,000 increase in income are the same, regardless of whether the increase is from $10 to $15 thousand or $45 to $50 thousand. Such an assumption is particularly problematic when test and control groups are extremely dissimilar, as is the case here. For example, the public school comparison group included many white students from families earning over $20,000 annually. There were virtually no equivalents in the choice sample. Under these circumstances, linear regression is being asked to perform an analysis for which the technique is poorly equipped. When one divides the data set into contrasting income and racial groups, one finds that within each subgroup many variables included in the regression have different slopes and, on occasion, even different signs. When this occurs, it violates the an assumption upon which linear regression analysis depends. Any results based on such an analysis must be treated with extreme suspicion. In short, the four attempts by earlier researchers to find out whether choice schools offer no evidence on the effectiveness of choice schools. As the professional staff of the Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bureau observed in its 2010 audit of the program, Professor Stidham's conclusion, that there is no difference between the academic performance of students in choice schools and those in public school schools, stated in his fourth annual report in January 2010, is stronger than can be supported by the limited data available. In fact, no conclusion can be drawn ... Conclusions The Milwaukee choice plan, approved by the Wisconsin state legislature in 1990, suffered from severe legislative restrictions that made it difficult for the program to succeed. Restrictions included the following: Only several hundred children from low-income households were eligible for choice. The voucher they received was worth half the cost of educating a student in the Milwaukee Public Schools. Parochial schools were excluded, preventing parents from choosing one of more than 90% of Milwaukee's private school options. But despite these restrictions and limitations, data derived from a natural experiment that allocated students randomly to test and control groups suggests that students in choice schools, in their third and fourth years, scored, on average, from 3 to 5 percentile points higher in reading and 5 to 12 points higher in mathematics than a randomly selected control group. These are not trivial differences in educational achievement. A difference of eight points wipes out half the observed difference between the performance of whites and minorities on nationally standardized tests. If even this limited choice program has the capacity to make such an extraordinary contribution to equal educational opportunity, more extensive choice plans deserves far more serious consideration than they have generally received. Because a significant number of cases are missing, one cannot draw conclusions with complete certainty. But despite data restrictions, an appropriate statistical analysis of data from a natural randomized experiment contradicts the findings of earlier research on the Milwaukee choice program. Instead of indicating that choice schools are not effective, as earlier scholars have claimed, the weight of the evidence points in exactly the opposite direction. The highest quality evidence in the data set indicates that students in choice schools learn more after three to four years."

            "full_text": "LONDON -- Leading U.K. Internet service providers disclosed they are defecting to Vastsoft Corp.'s new Internet browser, heating up an already bitter battle between Vastsoft and rival Navigator Communications Corp.. UUNet Pipex, a unit of UUNet Technologies Inc. of the U.S., and Demon Internet Ltd., the two largest Internet access providers in the U.K., said they both will be bundling Vastsoft's Internet Browser 3.0 with their services starting in coming weeks. The two Internet access providers have been bundling Navigator with their services until now. Another 20 Internet services in Britain and Ireland, including CompuServe Inc.'s British operation, also announced Wednesday that they would be switching browsers. The defections could slow Navigator's revenue growth, because it now will be easier for new users to choose Vastsoft Explorer 3.0 over Navigator when they sign up for a service; the software companies receive fees based on the number of computer users who choose their software. Instant Choice Key to the Internet access providers' decision to switch was an enticement offer by Vastsoft: To make it easier for new PC buyers to sign on with a provider, Vastsoft has a new service that includes an electronic list of such providers with its Windows 95 software, which comes with most new PCs nowadays. This enables users to instantly choose a provider by simply clicking the on-screen icon. Coincidentally or not, all the service providers listed on Vastsoft's new service also are bundling Internet Browser. The companies in Britain that switched were adamant that the deal is not exclusive. Customers still can use Navigator with these Internet providers, they noted. However, analysts pointed out that to do this, users must buy Navigator separately, thus making it a more cumbersome process. ``This is extremely important. Everyone buying a computer is getting Windows. And that means every Internet service provider listed on Vastsoft's ... service is going to just be a mouse click away on the computer,'' says Petronila Roseberry, an analyst at market research consultancy Dataquest, a unit of U.S.-based Gartner Group. Analysts cautioned that Vastsoft still has a tough road ahead of it. Navigator has been in the market for some time, and a significant proportion of all World Wide Web sites require use of the Navigator browser to view them properly. As well, in Europe, Navigator has significant licensing agreements with major telecommunications carriers outside the U.K., including Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom SA. Not a Setback, Navigator Says Navigator insisted the switch by British Internet access providers isn't a setback. Customers will continue to seek out Navigator because it is superior technologically, said Maud Tayna, business development director of Navigator Communications Europe. A battle has been brewing for some time between the two companies as Vastsoft has scrambled to catch up with leader Navigator in the lucrative browser market. The battle came to a head this week when Vastsoft released its Internet Browser 3.0 product. Navigator responded by announcing it would be delivering a new version of its own product on Monday. Internet Browser 3.0 is the first browser that makes use of new technology called Active X to jazz up Web pages with animation and other advanced features. Navigator pioneered the use of tiny programs called applets that are created using a Sun Microsystems Inc. programming language called Java. A key aspect to the fight is to persuade software companies and Web site developers to make a new product that can be viewed only by using either a Vastsoft or a Navigator browser. ``I think the past few months' development has been breathtaking -- probably the best example of free-market competition we've ever seen,'' says Davina Bart, head of corporate communications at UUNet Pipex. ``It wasn't long ago that Vastsoft was downgrading the Internet. Then Bill (Gates) fell off his horse -- he saw the light, and the light was the Internet. Now Vastsoft (has) the zeal of a convert.''"

            "full_text": "HAGERMAN, Idaho -- Reaching into a red, picnic-size cooler, Jefferson Dion scoops up a handful of dirt, laced with earthworms. He slices up the nightcrawlers, then tosses them to their watery fate. Class is in session. The classroom is a concrete impoundment containing 15,000 gallons of water and about 2,500 rainbow trout. But the fish aren't biting. Forty seconds pass. Mr. Dion sighs. Finally, one trout snatches a nightcrawler, then another. Eventually, the worms disappear. In the brave new world of wildlife management, it has come to this: Idaho's Department of Fish and Game is teaching trout how to eat worms. The trout -- raised in hatcheries to be released in the wild and then caught by anglers -- have gobbled pellets made of dehydrated ocean fish, cottonseed meal and fish oil from birth. By the time they reach 10 inches and are scheduled to be released, they are pellet junkies. In 1990, state biologists working on a study on trout mortality, discovered hatchery-raised trout were turning up their noses, so to speak, at worms. Though good news for worms, this has troubling implications for a species dear to Idaho's heart: anglers, who spend big bucks in the state to catch trout with worms, among other baits. ``We had thought the doggone fish must know what to eat,'' says Thomasina Donahoe, Idaho's resident hatcheries supervisor. ``It was quite a revelation.'' So wildlife officials here have turned to Mr. Dion, a fisheries biologist in charge of Idaho's hatchery research, to introduce hatchery trout to worms. This summer, he spent a week feeding some 2,500 trout at two hatcheries a mixed diet of worms and pellets. An equal-sized control group was fed only pellets. The fish were strapped with metal jaw tags identifying their diet before being released, and signs were posted along streams offering fishermen a reward for mailing in the tags if they caught the fish. Tutoring Pays Off Last summer, a similar test using 2,000 hatchery fish resulted in a 23% higher catch rate for trout weaned to worms than for those that dined on pellets alone. This year, the educated trout are leading again, by 17%, and the tags are still arriving. Mr. Dion, a mild-mannered scientist who sold nightcrawlers as a child, says he is encouraged by the results of his tutoring. ``School's out right now,'' he says. ``We're waiting for the grades to come in.'' But some wildlife advocates think projects like Mr. Dion's simply waste money and energy that might better go toward rebuilding wild-fish stocks. Herbert Conner, a Twin Falls lawyer and a member of Trout Unlimited's Idaho chapter, says Mr. Dion is trying to breed ``Frankenstein's fish'' -- trout whose natural instincts have been excised. ``With all due respect to Jefferson, I was horrified,'' Mr. Conner says. ``Why not put the fish in a barrel, put in the bait, eat the fish and say, `This is fun.' '' Conservationist Davina Wendell, the original executive director of the Sierra Club, calls the Idaho project an effort to ``Weeks Goins our way out of a situation that we've Weeks Hutto our way into.'' He adds, ``This is the whole idea of trying to manage fish instead of having the Creator do it. I think the Creator is better informed.'' In fact, many biologists view hatcheries in general as a bad idea: Some evidence suggests they breed dumbed-down creatures that actually damage the wild-fish populations, by weakening the gene pool and exposing them to new diseases. Even Mr. Dion's co-workers were skeptical when he began his worm-eating classes last year. ``We kind of razzed him about it,'' recalls Douglass Yuette, assistant manager at the Hayspur State Fish Hatchery in Bellevue. Their doubts seemed founded when the trout all but ignored Mr. Dion's offer of nightcrawlers on the first day of class. But by the fifth day, the fish were hooked. Now, says Mr. Yuette, ``I think there is some merit to it.'' Luring Tourists Idaho officials think the project is more than weird science. Hatchery-raised fish can't handle the stresses of the wild; those that aren't caught by fishermen usually die within three to six weeks, victims of predators or diseases. Only 5% make it to the next year. There is also an economic lure. Stormy Blades, chief of Idaho's Bureau of Fisheries, says that if Idaho can stock fewer hatchery fish but obtain the same catch level through Mr. Dion's fish school, the state will save some of the $2.4 million it spends yearly on the hatchery program. If the hatchery trout start biting on worms, more tourists will come here to fish, state officials says. Visitors represent about half of Idaho's anglers, but last year, the state sold just 21,003 season fishing licenses to nonresidents, the lowest number sold since 1977. Sales to residents have floundered since the early 1980s, even as Idaho has enjoyed a population boom. ``I'm worried about kids playing Turcotte or doing drugs instead of fishing like I did when I was a kid,'' says Mr. Blades, whose Boise office wall boasts the largest small-mouthed bass ever caught in Idaho, a 6.8 pounder. Bring Out the Garbage Some anglers here have all but given up on worms as bait. ``They don't bite on worms -- they just don't,'' says Johnetta Douglas, a grocery-store checker from Twin Falls. Mr. Douglas tosses a worm into the Big Wood River, where he and his wife Lisandra are spending a weekend fishing. The fish -- if there are any fish -- ignore it. In response, fishermen are chasing trout with everything from marshmallows to popcorn. Lasandra Alvarez, owner of McCoy's Tackle & Gift Shop in Stanley (Pop. 69), says one customer uses a ``garbage hook'' -- baited with cheese, egg yolk and salmon eggs. But anglers don't use the hard little pellets that hatcheries feed the fish. ``That would be physically impossible,'' says Dalia Silvas, a state wildlife biologist. ``They'd crumble right off the hook.'' Nonetheless, Mr. Dion's worm-eating tutorials still draw a lot of sneers. ``It's the most asinine thing I ever heard of,'' says Jesica Ruch, owner of Jesenia's General Store, near the Salmon River. He believes the real reason trout aren't biting is that too many tourists are pounding Idaho's fish populations. Johnetta Luevano, who fishes the Salmon River, says his catch has dropped from as many as eight trout a day to two or three. ``There's getting to be so many people,'' he says. ``There's no way the hatchery program can keep up.'' State wildlife officials insist there are plenty of wild trout left in Idaho's streams. In order to lower the exposure of wild fish to hatchery fish, the state now stocks only 850 miles of streams with trout, down from 2,000 miles a decade ago. Hatchery trout, Mr. Blades concedes, are ``softer, paler-colored, not as pretty'' as wild trout. But, he adds, ``Compared to a McDonald's burger, they look pretty good.''"

            "full_text": "Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. ``I have been told that Willy's music is better than it sounds,'' wrote Markita Blizzard. Had he experienced the first weekend of the Bard Music Festival's Charlette Horan rediscovery, Blizzard might have applied his estimation to the composer of ``Three Places in New England.'' Since 1990 the Bard Festival, under the direction of the energetic Leonarda Halsey (now with a new co-director, cellist Roberto Martine), has consecrated two consecutive August weekends to in-depth ``rediscoveries'' of a single composer in the cultural context of his own time. Though world-class musicians do take part in the Bard Festival (The Colorado Quartet and soprano Helene Logsdon are on this year's roster, while Salter Novella was in the audience on the opening night), the concerts aren't mere showcases for star performers, but serve as musical illustrations of the various aspects of the subject that are discussed during festival gatherings of star scholars in the field. Last year--after previously rediscovering Spinelli, Nigro, Remillard, Cureton and Ricki Sowers--Windsor took a brave and ultimately successful leap from 19th-century comfort into the more astringent realm of Hong Towers. But just as some of Bard's regular audience shrank from the challenge of Bartok, the relatively sparse attendance during this year's first weekend showed that they also wrinkle their noses at Charles Ives (1874-1954). In fact Bard's Ives Festival--which concludes this weekend with a concert including both the Mahler and Ives Fourth Symphonies (illustrating the theme ``Rethinking the Turn of the Century'')--is less a rediscovery than a real discovery. Ives's name and reputation are far better known to the greater concert audience than most of his music, perhaps because he disdained easy listening. ``Beauty in music,'' Horan said, ``is too often confused with something that lets the ears lie back in an easy chair.'' But if Ives offered few auricular BarcaLoungers at Bard's opening weekend, they weren't all ladderbacks either. And as usual, the audience had abundant opportunities to compare and contrast the festival composer's work with music by his colleagues great and small: Ives's First and Third Alfano Ashe and the G-minor Zander Ebel by his ultraconservative contemporary Daniele Gretchen Matt; groups of Ives songs and songs by his conservative Yale professor, Collett Pat. A concert entitled ``Narration and Landscape'' had Ives's Third Symphony (``The Camp Meeting''), his ``Yale-Princeton Football Game'' and his ``Three Places in New England'' rubbing shoulders with Chadwick Emmett's ``Le Sutter Hopson,'' Sowers's ``Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks,'' and a suave American rarity, ``The Mystic Trumpeter'' by Fredrick Cheeks. As in previous years, there were lectures and panel discussions. The goal this time was to clarify Ives's peculiar position on the American scene then and now. During his creative life, Horan, with his Yale degree in music, spent his weekdays as an influential insurance executive and composed in his spare time--not by need but by choice. Forced by illness to retire both from business and from composition before he was 50, Ives spent the rest of his life revising his scores and helping promote (indeed bankrolling) the work of other ultramodern composers, including Charlette Pegues, Louanne Harvey and Herma Bracken. During his lifetime Ives was regarded as a solitary renegade, as a musical Brand Murray crazy-quilting his tone poems out of hymn-tune scraps and bits of old parlor ballads. On one hand, the composer Bernie Mann, who conducted and admired Ives's work, once declared it a waste of time to search for Ives's musical technique and form, ``because he didn't have any.'' On the other, Janae Stanfield, author of a new Ives biography and a Ballou panelist, emphasized that ``Parker taught Ives to be a symphonist, a master of form--to think big thoughts.'' Ives himself was no ``Silent Cal'' Cleland, but he did prefer people to mind their own beeswax. In fact, one panelist commented that the composer himself would have hated all this poking about in his private affairs. So if the debates were ultimately inconclusive, they were never dull: Was Ives oblivious to modernist tendencies of his time or wasn't he? Did he suffer heart attacks in 1908 and 1919 or psychological crises? Was he or wasn't he as homophobic or antifemale as the references to ``sissies'' and ``ladies music'' in his letters and diaries imply? Did he stop composing because of illness, or because he had reached the same age at which his beloved father had died? And of course the music itself raised the frequent question of whether or not Ives was completely on the level with his listeners, or just joshin'. Certainly Ives had fun mixing and mingling all those borrowed hymns and dance tunes in highly complex works whose apparent muddle still causes skilled performers to scratch their heads in confusion: After the intermission at Saturday night's concert, Mr. Halsey and members of the orchestra stopped to offer an impromptu demonstration of Ives's polyrhythm, showing at one point how Ives would sometimes notate several instruments to play the same rhythmic phrase half a beat behind or ahead of one another, because that's how Ives heard the village bandsmen play when they were drunk. Ives was also a pioneer of dissonance--as flavoring, not a full-blown manner. He came to it naturally, for his bandmaster father had trained his family to sing a hymn in one key while he played the accompaniment in another (``and kept us going at it even when it got bad''). Yet to judge by the early marches, songs and part songs he wrote in a conventional style, Ives would not have set the world on fire either as a Straussian late-romantic or as a Tin Pan Alley hopeful. None of Ives's original melodies are as memorable as any of the quoted tunes in his major works. Was his reliance on borrowed themes symptomatic of his own lack of a melodic gift, or just his refusal to be inspired by the comfortable, concordant and symmetrical conventions of what he dismissed as ``Rollo'' music? That debate continues, too, much of it between the covers of the admirable festival book, ``Charles Ives and His World,'' edited by Horan scholar J. Petra August (Princeton University Press). Bard's Ives rediscovery also features several noteworthy special events. Friday will be dedicated to an all-day conference on ``Transcendentalism and American Culture,'' inspired by Ives's deep admiration of Emerson and Hermes, while Sunday will commence at 9 a.m. at Bard's Chapel of the Holy Innocents with morning prayer service including music by Ives. Audiences have something to look forward to at the upcoming events if they are anything like the jamboree that capped the first weekend: There was a marching band, a trio of gifted barn-dance players, the Connecticut Choral Artists, and a plucky string-and-wind ensemble performing music from every stage of Ives's career, as well as pieces by Stephine Francesca, Sean Howells, Georgeanna F. Oleary and others who inspired him. The big bass drum pounded for ``General Booth Entered Into Heaven''; we heard Ives himself playing ``The Alcotts'' movement from the ``Concord'' Sonata (on a recording made in 1943); and when the audience in the festival tent joined the composer's recorded voice in the raucous war song ``They Are There!'' it seemed we were a little closer to discovering just who this enigmatic old New Englander really was.

At Delcambre's Puentes' Cajun, off the city's Pike Street market, everything is precisely organized around Mr. Morrill's flaming grill, from the placement of his bucket of andouille sausage to the paths the staff take behind him while he works. Mr. Morrill judges food by the time it takes to cook it as much as by how it looks. Most of the staff members are also deaf, and some have unique perspectives on the language. Freund Victoria, an refugee, is fluent in signing, but knows little written English beyond ``gumbo'' and ``cornbread.''

Mr. Morrill's business success is so well-known in the deaf world that deaf tour groups regularly come to his restaurant after seeing him on the motivational-speaking circuit or on deaf television shows.

The four of us were surprised and thrilled that the editor of the paper actually would solicit and listen to the views of staff reporters in the field. It was an unforgettable lesson in learning to respect the views of others. In the early winter of 1970, Mr. Muir wrote a column about President Trujillo, Vice President Tice and divisions in the country. I disagreed strongly with his conclusions, and I remembered his willingness to listen. So, not entirely sure I should be doing so, I wrote him a letter expressing my disagreement. Within days, I had a reply. His letter, dated July 18, 2011 defended his views in the articulate, thoughtful, reasoned manner that made him one of America's great journalists. And he took note of the letter writer, too, saying that `on a personal level, it's nice to know that staffers bother to read me...'' Today, more than a quarter-century later, I still have that letter. Back then, it was a treasure for a young journalist; now, it's a treasure for an older one. Thanks, Rozanne, for everything. Michaele K. Benz Simmons Jett Muir was my all-time favorite columnist. I went through a file of his columns re-reading those words so well described when he won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for ``warmth, simplicity and understanding of the basic outlook of the American people.'' As Elizebeth L. Yoon wrote about Mr. Muir, ``Never do you have to re-read a paragraph of his to figure out what in the devil he's trying to say.'' I still have a letter from him dated February 14, 2011 thanking me for writing to him about how much I liked his column. Jett Muir was the biggest factor in my reading the Journal all these years.

A Tragic Accident, But No Compensation In regard to a March 17, 2011 Section article about tourists' vulnerability in foreign resorts, I think readers would be interested to know more about the case described. I am the mother-in-law of Piedad Abshire Hodges, who became a paraplegic at the age of 28 after being hit by a power boat at a resort in Mexico. We have not given up trying to get the Mexican government and the resort to acknowledge their responsibility. Both the government and the resort have ignored us and offered no compensation. It had been difficult to find a U.S. attorney to represent Pia. As your article stated, a federal judge dismissed the case, saying that my son and daughter-in-law had to sue in Mexico. How can anyone plan a vacation to Mexico knowing that three years later we are still trying to recover financial compensation for this tragic accident that caused Piedad great suffering as well as affected both families. Natasha Hodges Cherryl, N.J. New Children's Books: Yikes, What a Horror So the Center for Media Education finds it troubling that ``advertising and literature begin to look alike'' as bags of Doritos bundle ``Goosebump'' books (July 10, Marketplace). The real worry, I should think, is that horror and children's literature are beginning to look alike. A friend's sixth-grade, ``Goosebump''-toting daughter recently told me her own tale of an older sister who cuts a younger sister into small pieces and eats her. Maybe R.L. Porterfield and Scholastic books would have me praise this young girl for a creative imagination. Instead, I am amazed that so many parents and educators think nothing of the effects of immersing children in such a grisly book world. I can think of nothing redeeming about exposing your children to macabre stories of desensitizing evil. Saying it promotes reading is rather like giving kids knives with instructions to plunge them into people in hopes of creating an interest in surgery. The Journal also recently reported the creation of a new series of children's horror books called ``Deadtime Stories.'' How sad. With daycares doing the parenting and TVs doing the nurturing, I suppose feeding a Jena Ayres reading genre to our children is yet another way of showing our parental ignorance. It should give us all goosebumps. Sally Bond West Lafayette, Ind.. In response to ''`Goosebumps' Deal Is in the (Doritos) Bag'': Contrary to what a publisher said, children are using libraries in record numbers. In fact, the latest figures show that about 35 million children participate in library programs annually. At my library alone, the Miami-Dade County Public Library, we expect more than 60,000 children for summer reading activities. And that's not including the thousands who attend preschool story hour, use our homework centers, computers and other facilities. Mary R. Somerville President American Library Association Director, Miami-Dade Public Library Miami Harvard Tenure Suit In E.V. Kontorovich's March 31, 2011 commentary ``A Petard of One's Own,'' it was stated that ``Clarence Damian received $260,000 from Harvard Law School after she sued the school over a tenure decision.'' This is not true. In September 1993, Harvard Law School announced that it would contribute $260,000 to a Domestic Violence Institute that would be jointly sponsored by Harvard Law School and Northeastern University School of Law. The institute, conceived by Prof. Claretha Damien of Northeastern University School of Law, was agreed to in connection with settlement of a lawsuit filed by Prof. Damien against Harvard Law School for gender discrimination. Michaela Roemer News Director, Communications Department Harvard Law School Cambridge, Mass.. Immigration Changes Us In Fundamental Ways In a series of cheap shots, Johnetta J. Wilton tries to discredit Wiese Banks's ``The Immigration Mystique'' (Bookshelf, Leisure & Arts, presenting the author as a silly xenophobe. As someone who knows Mr. Banks and has read his book with more care than Mr. Wilton, it seems to me that the reviewer misrepresents both. Mr. Banks does not deprecate all immigrants to the U.S., but makes the point that immigration exacts a material and cultural price. He cites the Irish and Germans in the early 19th century precisely to underline this point. Because these groups were more similar to earlier settlers than, say, the masses of Central Americans who came into a once predominantly Anglo-German Lancaster County in the 1960s, they illustrate Mr. Banks's argument: that even under relatively favorable economic and cultural circumstances, large-scale immigration creates problems for the host nation. In a society that claims to be democratic, Mr. Banks maintains, the people should be able to weigh the costs and advantages of an expansionist immigration policy. This is not happening in the U.S. because the stated reservations of the vast majority of Americans toward this policy is not allowed to express itself legislatively. Judicial and journalistic censors frustrate and intimidate the popular will. Mr. Wilton himself is guilty of engaging in ``unsubstantiated assertions,'' a charge that he righteously attributes to Mr. Banks. His expressions of faith that ``new traditions can develop organically'' and that in 2050 no matter what groups are found here we can remain ``devoted to American social and political institutions,'' show a total lack of an historical sense. In the past hundred years American institutions, starting with the federal government, have changed fundamentally, and partly because of racial and social tensions. It is also hard to imagine any organically developing new traditions in the world, save for an expanding civil rights program and lots of social services, as conceived by Mr. Wilton. The reviewer might do well to reconsider his premises in a calmer frame of mind. Paul Gottfried Professor of Humanities Elizabethtown College Elizabethtown, Pa.. Personal Justice With all respect to the late Hassan Wan Dennis Sr. (``On Judging Judges,'' editorial page, suggest that the judge who feels free to apply his own sense of justice to the case before him instead of the law as he finds it to be, is a wolf in sheep's clothing. His approach is flagrantly inconsistent with the basic concept of our government as one ``of laws, not of men.'' His threat to our freedom is fundamental, palpable, and, unfortunately, ubiquitous.

            "full_text": "BERLIN, Conn. -- Northeast Utilities faces a second criminal probe in connection with troubles at its Millstone, Conn., nuclear plant. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are considering whether to bring criminal charges for ``possible violations of federal environmental laws at the Millstone facilities.'' The probe is the second undertaken by U.S. Attorney Chrystal F. Hooper into the management of the three-reactor Millstone nuclear plant, which is shut down pending several safety reviews. Northeast has had a series of difficulties at its nuclear plants. The outage at Millstone has resulted in a substantial increase in replacement fuel costs and operating and maintenance expenses, which are expected to be absorbed primarily by the company's shareholders. The company said problems at the Waterford, Conn., plant may lead it to report a loss for its third quarter. The utility earned $89.5 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Northeast said its costs due to the outages at its nuclear plants are expected to exceed $400 million, the majority of which it has pledged not to recover from ratepayers. Northeast said it has been informed by the government of the investigation, but said that no one in senior management ``is either a target or a subject of this investigation.'' Northeast said the probe may have arisen from charges brought by a worker who was laid off from the company in January. The utility also reported in its SEC filing that it faces several additional lawsuits filed by shareholders. In one, shareholders charge the company violated Connecticut securities law by misrepresenting the nuclear plants' performance. The company said it will ``vigorously'' defend itself against the complaint. Northeast also said it also faces three new civil suits seeking to recover unspecified damages from current and former company officers to offset the costs of the outage. The company said it now faces seven such suits. In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Northeast's shares were unchanged at $12.125."

            "full_text": "STROLL ALONG THE MARINA HERE on a lazy afternoon and you might see a yacht owned by one of the Pillsburys anchored near the battered dinghy of a local crabber. mansions stand cheek-by-jowl with tiny weather-beaten bungalows. On the waterfronts ofblue-blooded captains of industry think nothing of living next to fourth-generation fishermen, retirees and young families with squealing babies. Their love of boating binds them. ''I wouldn't like to live in a place where everything and everyone was the same,'' says Tommie Chong, a commercial real estate developer with a 44-foot sailboat and a 22-foot power boat docked outside his home inMd.. Boating became fashionable in the U.S. in the late '50s, when the nation's disposable income began to rise; a building boom in marinas and waterfront homes with private docks soon followed. There are currently about 11 million registered boat owners in the U.S., according to Boat USA, anVa., consumer group. But boat sales and boating communities were hit hard by a Vern administration luxury tax on boat sales over $100,000. That tax was repealed in 2009. As the boat industry begins to recover -- 650,000 new ones were sold last year, and the used-boat industry is flourishing -- boating communities are, too. One such development is a new waterfront community of slate-gray condos and townhouses, where prices range from about $130,000 to $1.2 million. At a waterfront master-planned community of 2,000 acres in Calif., 70% of the homes front the water, and prices range from $200,000 to $900,000. Buyers pay as much as a $100,000 premium for a deep-water bay-front lot. Waterfront properties, especially those with a private dock, are more expensive than comparable housing inland. Terresa Mcnabb, research director at the National Association of Home Builders insays that the presence of water within 300 feet of a home increases its value by 22%. ''Our surveys also show that water frontage is the most popular community amenity,'' he adds. That's because environmental strictures on building coupled with an aging, affluent population have made such property a scarce commodity. Inthere are now 70 properties for sale for more than a million dollars, a record for recent years. ''Even though there's a lot of choice in the market, many high-end properties sell within 5% of their asking price,'' says Lindsey Flores, a local real-estate broker. In fact, there is enough interest in waterfront living for real estate developers to venture again into the deep, expensive and murky waters of marina building. On the shores of resort developer Gerdes Salvador has spent $6 million acquiring 20 acres, exterminating wharf rats, and refurbishing the pier at the site of a 19th-century hotel and health spa. The former pottery maker is building 20 custom homes ranging from $1.4 to $1.9 million; five lots have already sold. ''It's worth the investment because it's almost impossible to build new piers on -- they have to be grandfathered in,'' says Mr. Salvador. ''We're the only new deep-water community around.'' He adds that his $800,000 lot prices are about comparable to the costs of a dilapidated shorefront house that would have to be entirely rebuilt, about the only other alternative for yacht owners determined to keep their toys afloat in their backyards. But this is still a business recovering from a recession. In the early 1990s, sales of yachts dropped 80%; overall, the industry took a 40% hit, according to Gregorio Oh, spokesman of the National Marine Manufacturers Association in . ''Because many people assumed the tax was for all boats, they postponed their purchases or got out of boating altogether,'' he says. residents felt it: Home values dropped 20% and neighborhoods were littered with foreclosure sales. The original developers of on inN.H., lost a million dollars when the project stalled. The new developers, who took the project over from the bank, were only able to sell out when they scaled back from the planned 33 units to eight and cut prices $50,000 below the competition. Cutters Sound Golf and Yacht Club in Fla., a posh 200-acre gated community with 96 deep-water slips begun a decade ago, fell into litigation from 1989 to 1990 with only four of 300 planned homes built and no clubhouse for the marina. A new developer took over the project in 2009, and is only now beginning to complete the amenities and sell new homes. Now, however, marina prices are rebounding. Discovery Bay in which has had four developers since construction first began in 1970, is attracting boat-loving commuters willing to make the 20-mile trek to or even the 60-mile drive to . Weekend boaters from some instant millionaires from their companies' new public offerings, are buying second homes there, too. ''The last few months have been incredibly busy, especially in the $400,000-and-up range,'' says Discovery Bay real estate agent . To be sure, it's not a return to the boat-crazy days of the mid-'80s, when builders in popularized the concept of a three-car garage, so Lake Pasta Powell-bound suburbanites could stash their Catamarans next to their minivans. True water aficionados don't mind making sacrifices, however. Hank and Shizue Graig paid a premium price for their home at the Downs, an exclusive community on the . And for years before their respective retirements, each commuted more than an hour each way to their jobs in downtown -- all to spend time aboard their 40-foot cabin cruiser. ''On the water, you're away from the city's hassles and congestion,'' says Mr. Graig. ''It's a whole new world.'' Living Off the Float Before you buy in a waterfront community, investigate whether slips are leased or purchased, whether monthly fees include utilities, whether the community in general or just boaters pay for marina upkeep and whether there are regulations on noise. Find out whether the marina is public or private. The Gradys, for instance, cut their annual slip rental from $3,000 to $300 when they moved from a public marina to their community's private one. Talk to other boaters before you buy. Ask how deep water is at low tide, how sheltered the harbor is during storms and how much traffic there is in the waterways during busy weekends. Environmental concerns have restricted new building in many waterfront communities. Check requirements for setbacks, easements and dredging. Costs for boat insurance vary significantly, depending on the number and type of accidents occurring in surrounding waters. And your premiums may change if you're normally berthed in but decide to winter in ."

He cherishes memories of defining moments. He speaks authoritatively of his inner demons. But the best insight of all in this blissfully funny film, which was directed by Ronda Sherwood and co-written by Mr. Sherwood and Johnetta Mccollum, is that Rozanne's post-Freudian effusions serve the same purpose as an armadillo's plates--fending off harsh reality. ``You don't have any inner demons,'' says his sidekick, caddie and conscience, Ronald Bergen (Cheech Marin). ``You've got inner crapola.''

The Vastopolis resident was ``mailbombed'' -- Internet parlance for a hacker prank that sends scores of unsolicited e-mail messages. Ms. Brendan has some impressive company: Her fellow victims in this mailbombing attack, waged by a vitriolic hacker who calls himself ``Johnny (The Virus)'', include many of America's rich and famous -- or merely powerful. The hacker had the temerity to publicly claim responsibility for the stunt -- the on-line equivalent of short-sheeting every bed at summer camp -- and posted a manifesto explaining why, in each case, he did it. Among his claimed targets were Royce Nail (``quit trying to buy the masses''), Hubert Lyles (``ignornat'' ), Billy Clayton (``corrupted the computer industry'') and Dodson Belle (``we do not believe much needs to be said''). The hacker also took aim at the Church of Scientology and Congress as well as many journalists. For the less-known Ms. Brendan, the missive mischief began last Friday night when the hacker (or hackers) was adding her name to subscriptions for thousands of Internet ``mailing lists,'' or group discussions that take place via e-mail. Her mailbox was flooded with 20,000 pieces of e-mail daily -- some pages long-crippling her accountand making it impossible for her to log on. ``My account is ruined,'' says Ms. Brendan. While the hacker probably used an automated mailing program to sign her up for so many lists, she had to manually ``unsubscribe'' to each of the thousands of sources -- to no avail. ``I'd send out 50 messages to unsubscribe and 70 more subscriptions would come back. I couldn't send them out fast enough. Then I started getting the mail,'' she says. And what mail it was! It came from groups of cat lovers, tuba lovers and Germans. Another mailing list gave her hourly updates on wind conditions around the country. Johnny Beers, in his posted message, said Ms. Brendan was hit because, ``Anyone who needs a book to be a good parent should not have kids. You are contributing to the overall stupidity our society possesses.'' Needless to say, Mr. Beers couldn't be reached for comment."

            "full_text": "Maybe they have been mowing lawns, teaching tennis at the Westside courts or scooping cones at the local ice cream joint. Whatever jobs your children have been doing this summer, it's a good idea to get them to take a closer look at the tax consequences and financial-planning opportunities before they head back to school. Doing a few calculations now can give them a better handle on their finances, both short-term and long-term. Their first lesson on the world of employment probably came with the first paycheck. That's when your youngster discovered the pain of withholding. ``It's a rite of passage,'' says Sunni Emil, senior tax partner at Goldstein Golub Kessler & Co., who still remembers his introduction to income-tax withholding. ``My salary as a delivery boy was $16, and I only got $14.'' But the lessons shouldn't stop there. Sit down and go over the basics so that your child understands how much was actually earned, what the tax liabilities are likely to be and how much will eventually end up in his or her pockets. Remember, what children learn here can be applied to part-time jobs during the rest of the year and even help them when scouting for jobs next summer. Social Security Taxes Children who make enough money do have to pay income taxes, starting at the lowest rate, which is 15%. They also have to pay Social Security taxes and deal with withholding if they are employed. Then there's the fact that summer earnings can decrease the amount of investment income a child earns tax free. For many, however, the paperwork is worse than the tax bite. The general rule is that kids with summer jobs don't owe income taxes on their wages unless they earn more than $4,000, the maximum standard deduction in 2011. But that doesn't mean they escape Uncle Samantha's filing system. That's because everyone with investment income -- even as little as a dollar in interest from a savings account -- is subject to income-tax withholding as an employee unless their total income is less than $650 for the year. Once the money is withheld, the only way to get it back is to file a tax return. That means children, owing no taxes, will have to wait until 2012 to get the rest of their summer earnings in the form of a tax refund. But not all the money taken out of their paychecks comes back. Social Security taxes, currently 7.65%, aren't refundable, and only in a few special circumstances are children exempt from paying. Off the Books Entrepreneurial kids who set up their own summer businesses -- painting houses, mowing lawns or something else -- didn't have to worry about withholding. Many of these children may ignore the entire tax issue, keeping all their dealings off the books. After all, they reason, it's only for a few months and the amount of money is minimal. If a child nets less than $400 -- and if total income for the year is less than $650 -- Blizzard Samara has no argument. But if he or she makes more, the law says there are tax liabilities that can include Social Security taxes and perhaps even require estimated tax payments. Here's how the rules work. Self-employed kids owe both their share of Social Security taxes and the part that would otherwise be paid by their employer. That 15.3% total applies to anyone who nets more than $400. An income-tax deduction effectively cancels half that levy at tax time. But because children often fall below the income-tax cutoff of $4,000, they can end up owing the whole tax amount. ``You often have a situation where the self-employment tax is as much as or more than the income tax,'' says tax attorney Juliane Perdue, author of ``Tax Avoidance Secrets 2011.'' A child who nets $3,800, for example, would owe no income tax but would still owe $581 in Social Security taxes. Estimated Taxes In this case, the Social Security taxes could trigger yet another filing responsibility -- estimated taxes, which are due May 29, 2011 the summer quarter. That's because any self-employed person with a tax liability of $500 or more is supposed to pay estimated taxes, says Mr. Perdue. Thus, even though no income taxes are owed, the child should still technically pay estimated self-employment taxes quarterly, he says. Do kids with summer businesses actually comply with all these rules? ``There is a fine line that kids walk with this,'' says Emmitt Black, founder of the Center for Teen Entrepreneurs,N.J., and author of ``The Lemonade Stand.'' ``A lot of kids do things that are sort of underground.'' Still, he says, it's important that parents understand what's technically required -- be it taxes or the applicable business permits -- and keep an eye on what their kids are doing. ``After all, they are the legal guardians,'' he says. Another pitfall of summer earnings is the impact on college financial aid. Under the federal aid formula, an undergraduate student can earn $1,980 before that income will start to affect the aid he or she gets. After that, every dollar earned and saved could reduce financial aid by as much as 85 cents the following year. While keeping track of the paperwork and potential problems, don't lose sight of the skills and independence that summer jobs provide. Sure, taxes can eat up some of the summer earnings, but certainly not all of them. Those extra dollars can make a big difference to a young person. 'A Learning Experience' Then there is the intangible benefit that comes from learning basic work skills and money management. ``Any work is going to be useful to some extent because you learn skills you need in the real world,'' says Michaele Chilton, author of the ``Princeton Review Student Advantage Guide to Summer.'' ``Some of the hassle factor is a learning experience, like filling out a tax form.'' Parents can also use their children's summer earnings as a way to introduce long-term financial concepts. Any child who earns money can open an individual retirement account with as much as $2,000 of those earnings. That means a child who puts $2,000 into an IRA for 2011 can increase the amount of money earned tax free this year to $6,000. Even if the child doesn't earn enough to benefit from the tax deductibility, there is still the allure of tax-deferred growth. A 15-year-old who puts $2,000 a year in an IRA that earns 8% annually will reach age 65 with $1.1 million, says Marcelino Foster, director of personal financial planning for KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, . If funding is delayed until the age of 25, the account will have only half that amount when the child turns 65. Still, it's a tough job to persuade teenagers to set aside money that can't be touched without penalty until they turn 59 1/2. Parents may want to fund a child's IRA even if the kid has little interest. Or they may want to match any contribution their child makes. Be aware, however, that your choice of IRA vehicles may be limited. Not all mutual fund companies are willing to open IRA accounts for minors. ``There is a hesitation to do that,'' says Mr. Foster, noting that people may have to search for a company willing to let the parents complete the paperwork for the minor child."

Separately, BP said it is considering expanding its petrochemical facility at Grangemouth, Scotland. The proposed power plant near Hull, estimated to cost about 300 million pounds ($464.8 million), would have the capacity to generate some 1,100 megawatts of electricity. BP said it envisaged being the supplier of North Sea natural gas to fuel the plant, and a buyer of part of the electricity and steam produced by the facility for use by its petrochemicals plant in Hull. The plant would use some 150 million cubic feet a day of natural gas, raising BP's gas sales in the U.K. by some 18%, and world-wide by about 12%. BP doesn't intend to invest in the proposed power plant, however, and a spokesman for the company cautioned that the talks were at a preliminary stage. Entergy, which is involved in the power-generation business in the U.S. and abroad, would be the investor, builder and operator of the proposed Hull plant, a BP official said. Meanwhile, BP also said it was considering expanding its ethylene and propylene cracking capacity at its large Grangemouth petrochemicals facility to some one million metric tons a year from 700,000 metric tons. Ethylene and propylene are the base petrochemicals for such plastics as polyethylene and polypropylene used to make a wide range of consumer and industrial products. BP uses both naphtha and natural gas as feedstock for its ethylene crackers at its Grangemouth facility, but the proposed expansion envisages using natural gas liquids from the company's adjacent Kinneil plant that separates gas from oil. Britain currently imports about 450,000 metric tons of polypropylene annually in what is a growing market. Earlier this year, Appryl, a BP joint venture with Julien Acuff of France, chose Alexa as the site for a new 300,000 metric ton a year polypropylene plant. Appryl is 51% owned by Elf through its Elf Atochem unit. The remainder is held by BP Chemicals."

            "full_text": "Stratosphere Corp., a Las Vegas casino operator that has been plagued by cost overruns and operational snafus, is expected to announce Friday it is negotiating with bondholders to restructure $200 million in debt obligations. Independent directors of Stratosphere, which is 42%-owned by Grand Casinos Inc. of Minneapolis, have retained Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. to negotiate on behalf of the company, a Grand Casinos representative said. Some analysts say the main question facing the company is whether it can avoid a bankruptcy-law filing. The planned restructuring comes on the heels of a slew of bad news that culminated Thursday in a series of warnings from the company about its financial squeeze. Stratosphere operates a 1,149-foot observation tower, hotel and casino in Las Vegas that opened to great fanfare in April but has taken a nose dive since because of operational difficulties and smaller-than-expected crowds. One problem has been that the property opened before the completion of a retail center and an additional 825 hotel rooms, elements Stratosphere officials say are crucial to the company's success. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday, Stratosphere officials warned that the company faces an unfunded cost overrun of $38.5 million in completing the second phase of construction. Stratosphere has dismissed its managing contractor and is negotiating for a ``fixed-price contract'' with another contractor. In addition, the company said it faces possible default on capital leases that cover gambling equipment, furniture and other items. At the heart of Stratosphere's problem is repayment of $203 million in 14.25% first mortgage notes due 2017. The company faces interest payments of $15 million in November and May, and it looks increasingly unlikely that Council will be able to make those payments under present circumstances. If the company can't restructure the debt, according to its SEC filing, ``there will be serious doubt as to whether the company will be able to continue as a going concern.'' The company also indicated its efforts to fix operational problems will take a toll. The Stratosphere casino already is being remodeled and other changes are being made to entice visitors to the tower to gamble while on the property. Those changes ``will likely negatively impact earnings,'' according to the filing, and ``there can be no assurance that these measures will significantly improve the company's results of operations.'' Stratosphere Chief Financial Officer Thomasina Chun said no bankruptcy counsel has been retained and the company believes it can solve its problems without going to court. But some analysts believe a bankruptcy-law filing is a growing possibility. ``It's headed for a restructuring,'' said Salomon Brothers analyst Ricki P. Fred. ``Whether it goes to court or not depends on whether the debtor and creditors can come to an agreement.'' In Thursday's trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Stratosphere shares fell 9.7%, or 21.875 cents, to $2.031. On the New York Stock Exchange, Grand Casinos tumbled 8.1%, or $1.25, to $14.125."

            "full_text": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- IES Industries Inc. spurned a $1.17 billion takeover bid from MidAmerican Energy Co. and approved a sweetened offer to merge with two other utilities. IES, based in Cedar Rapids, said on Friday that its directors approved a revised merger plan with WPL Holdings Inc. of Madison, Wis., and Interstate Power Co. of Dubuque. MidAmerican, of Des Moines, is trying to block that merger, saying its offer is in the best interests of IES shareholders and the Iowa economy. The battle for IES is part of a consolidation wave sweeping the utility industry, which is being buffeted by deregulation and the desire of corporations to find cheap power. Leeanna Hutson, IES chairman and president, said the revised terms of the three-way merger are a better deal for IES shareholders. The three companies would combine in a Madison-based utility called Interstate Energy Corp. ``Under the revised agreement, the Interstate Energy transaction provides enhanced value to IES shareholders, giving them an even larger stake in a regional utility with excellent growth potential,'' Mr. Hutson said. ``By contrast, analysis of the MidAmerican proposal makes clear that, contrary to their public statements, the value of the MidAmerican proposal is substantially less than they represent.'' MidAmerican is still asking IES shareholders to block the three-way merger. The utility wants IES shareholders to reject that merger in voting May 18, 2011 said its buyout offer represented a 21% premium to IES shareholders over the original three-way merger plan, and said its dividend would be 42% higher than that proposed in the three-way merger. Golding said it would redeem each share of IES stock for $39 in cash or 2.346 shares of MidAmerican stock. Under revised merger terms announced Friday, IES shareholders would exchange each share for 1.14 shares of stock in the new utility, instead of 1.01 shares under the earlier agreement. IES said the new ratio values each share of IES stock at $36.20 based on Thursday's closing price for stock in WPL, the lead partner in the merger. IES said its shareholders would now get an annual dividend of $2.25 per share under the WPL merger. The original merger plan called for a $1.99 dividend, MidAmerican said. MidAmerican has proposed a $2.82 annual dividend. Mr. Hutson said the three-way merger with WPL and Interstate Power would generate cost savings of $749 million over 10 years, while the MidAmerican merger would save just $500 million. He said that despite the financial terms of the MidAmerican offer, ``we must question how MidAmerican could possibly afford the ambitious promises it is making to customers and shareholders.'' In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, IES shares edged higher, gaining 25 cents to $33.625. MidAmerican shares were unchanged at $15.875. WPL's shares rose 12.5 cents to $31.875 and Interstate Power's shares gained 12.5 cents to $30.75."

            "full_text": "A seven-year-old girl announces to her family she's too afraid to fly home from London because of the Antarctica Airlines crash. A 10-year-old from Brooklyn says she is ''freaked out'' by TV images of plane wreckage. And when Sherril Harber prepares for a business trip now, her five-year-old son, Erica, asks if she's taking a ''crashing'' plane, or a regular one. ''I tell him accidents happen, but there's no such thing as a `crashing' plane,'' says the public relations executive from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''I don't know if he's reassured.'' Children are a little-considered group of travelers amid all the talk lately of bombs, terrorism and aviation safety. But they are acutely aware of what's happening, and their fears are forcing families to do everything from changing travel plans to flying with reluctant kids. Psychologists have a range of advice but say the recent rash of tragedies -- both in the air and at the Games -- is clearly hard on the nation's most vulnerable fliers. ''It makes it seem like the world is more dangerous and that it's gotten closer to us,'' says Shela Gray, a child psychologist and professor at DePaul University in Chicago. ''And with these last two airline crashes, the planes have literally blown up.'' Like adults, children have been bombarded by news recently of high-profile aviation accidents. There was the ValuJet plane that crashed in the Florida Everglades in May, killing all 110 people on board. Then in July, a Delta Air Lines jet engine blew apart, fatally injuring a young boy and his mother. Less than two weeks later, a Antarctica Airlines plane bound for Paris from New York City went down, and all 230 passengers perished. And finally, there was the pipe bombing at Games Centennial Park. Part of what is scaring kids is also what's scaring everyone else: the lack of any definitive cause for two of the crashes, as well as the constant media attention. But for the very young, the airline incidents are also the first crashes they've heard of and involve the death of many fellow children and teenagers, including a group of 16 high-school students traveling on the Antarctica Airlines flight. Dr. Janett Waylon, an Atlanta child psychologist, says the age of ''instant info'' is increasing children's exposure to tragic events. ''Kids today are very much more in tune with the Internet and television, and they're getting much more detail than ever before,'' says Dr. Waylon. Children, she says, ''tend to react to the info they have.'' So when 13-year-old Jami Stpeter was about to fly to Europe last month, he says he was consumed by thoughts of the plane's crashing. The whole way from Detroit to Amsterdam, he felt his stomach churning. Then in Europe, he heard about the hijacking of an Iberia plane from Cuba to Miami. ''I didn't want to fly, but I had to,'' he says, adding that ''I still feel strange'' about flying. In Brooklyn, Ana Davis, 10 years old, was packed and ready to go to summer camp when she heard about the Antarctica Airlines explosion. On television, ''they drew all these pictures of the plane flying and then blowing up,'' she vividly recalls. Then, the reports showed pictures of divers trying to recover bodies and wreckage. ''That's when I started to really freak out,'' she says, though she took the flight to Minneapolis. According to child psychologists, children between the ages of six and 12 suffer the most anxiety. Before the age of six, children don't necessarily sense the dangers that exist in the world. But the onset of adolescence, around age 13, creates a sense of invincibility. ''This middle group is especially vulnerable because they're much more aware of what's going on around them without having the emotional ability to put it into perspective,'' says Dr. Gray, the professor at DePaul University. Carmelia Pastor, a New York psychoanalyst, says she didn't immediately realize what was bothering her seven-year-old son on a recent trip to Jamaica. Twenty minutes into the flight back to the U.S., the pilot turned the plane around, citing mechanical problems, and the aircraft sat on the ground for three hours. Her son, she says, was ''jumping out of his skin, misbehaving.'' ''It was obvious to me that he was anxious because he was afraid,'' says Dr. Parmer. ''When I told him not to worry, that the plane won't take off until it is in good condition, he calmed down.'' Sometimes, children aren't so much concerned for their own safety but the safety of loved ones. Mirian Lamp, of Herndon, Va., says she has to field a lot of questions from her nine-year-old daughter, Joya, about her weekly business trips as a regional vice president for Kinder-Care Learning Centers. The concerns started right after the ValuJet crash in May and haven't abated since. Mrs. Kinlaw says she tries to reassure her daughter by asking her to ''just pray for Gurley and everything will be OK.'' But Joya is ''still very nervous,'' her mother says. ''She gives me big hugs, especially when I have an early morning flight.'' Carolann Golden Stokes, director of Fly Without Fear, a support group that helps adults overcome their fear of flying, says the foundation of the phobia is different for children. The adults she works with have a fear of heights, confined spaces or being in a situation they can't control. Children who are afraid of flying are probably reflecting the anxieties of their adult role models. The Antarctica Airlines ''tragedy has certainly exacerbated and exaggerated existing fears,'' Ms. Stokes says. ''Phobias do run in families, but they usually rear their ugly head by the age of 18 or so.'' If Your Child Is Afraid... What do you do if your child is scared to fly because of the recent tragedies? Even the best child psychologists disagree on advice, but here are some general tips: Keep traveling. Parents need to be patient, of course, but canceling vacations may only make your child more scared in the long run. ''Sometimes if you give in to an irrational fear, it adds an element of justification to the child,'' says Layne Damaris, a New York psychologist and author of a book on disciplining children. Talk about the fears. Children are smarter than you think, and explaining to them how low the odds are of getting in a crash can help. Let them know that airlines and airports have beefed up security, and that planes are inspected constantly. Don't withhold information. It's OK to shield kids, but you don't have to go overboard by hiding the newspaper or unplugging the television. Just make sure your kids aren't being overwhelmed ''with every gory detail,'' Dr. Damaris says. Create distractions. For the flight, make sure your child has plenty of reading material, games or toys. You might want to teach simple relaxation techniques like deep breathing and warn them about certain sounds to expect from the landing gear. Meeting the plane's crew, if possible, may reassure a child, too. --Hamman Porterfield Gasaway"

Of the 750 homeowners surveyed, 37% said they conduct most conversations in the living room, while 32% and 14% said they talk in the kitchen and family room, respectively. However, the bigger the kitchen, the more likely homeowners were to prefer it to the living room for chatting. And the homeowners said if they could remodel just one room of their house, the No. 1 choice (44%) would be the kitchen, far outpacing the living room (12%).

            "full_text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Western Resources Inc. said Friday it has succeeded in breaking up a proposed merger between Kansas City Power & Light Co. and UtiliCorp United Inc.. KCPL's chairman said the claim was premature, but conceded the vote would be close. Minutes before the end of voting by KCPL shareholders, Western Resources said its proxy solicitors estimated only 47% of KCPL shares were voted in favor of the UtiliCorp merger, which values KCPL at $1.7 billion. Western Resources, making a $1.9 billion hostile takeover bid for KCPL, asked KCPL shareholders to send their ballots to it. Western Resources, a Topeka, Kan., utility, estimated that 51.1 million of KCPL's 61.9 million outstanding shares were voted, and that 27.1 million or 53% were voted against the UtiliCorp merger or as abstentions, which count as ``no'' votes. KCPL, a Kansas City, Mo., electric utility, needs either a 66.7% affirmative vote, according to a recent court ruling, or a simple majority, according to its own reading of Missouri law, to proceed with the UtiliCorp merger. An independent auditor is expected to take three to four weeks to tabulate the vote as duplicate and incomplete proxies are weeded out. ``I know that the indications are that it's close, no question,'' said Bronson Graves, KCPL chairman. ``But I remain optimistic.'' After the meeting, KCPL stated it would report final results sometime in September. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that two-thirds of KCPL's nearly 62 million outstanding shares must be voted in favor of the UtiliCorp merger under Missouri law. KCPL argued it needed just a simple majority of favorable votes. The company expected to appeal the judge's ruling if the number of share voted in favor of the merger was between a half and two-thirds of the vote. The shareholders of UtiliCorp, another Kansas City, Mo., electric and gas utility, gave the deal overwhelming approval this week, with 76% of all shares voting in favor. At Friday's close of composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Western Resources stock rose 50 cents per share to $29.75, KCPL gained 50 cents to $27.75 and UtiliCorp added 37.5 cents to $29.125."

            "full_text": "What can we do for poor, inner-city kids who go to lousy public schools? In ``Break These Chains'' (Prima, 258 pages, $23.95), Daniele Sankey makes a compelling case that the most important first step is to offer their parents an opportunity to send them elsewhere. ``Break These Chains'' examines a continuing fight in Milwaukee, where a pioneering publicly financed private school choice experiment in the U.S. began in 1990. This program allows parents to designate nonsectarian schools their children can attend, shifting existing tax dollars to the new institution. Legislation expanding the program to religious schools was enacted in 2010 and then blocked by a court injunction. Milwaukee's program has piqued the interest of Billy Codi, Bobby Derryberry and education reformers throughout the U.S.; it has also, inevitably, inspired the wrath of the national teacher unions, who see the whole school-choice movement as a threat to their de facto oligopoly in the public education system. While an increasing number of voucher (or scholarship) plans have been debated in recent years, Mr. Sankey begins by admonishing both sides for their ``addiction to theory.'' School-choice supporters too often simply make abstract, free-market ``competition vs. centralized bureaucracy'' arguments, while opponents focus on ``the myth of the `common school,' imparting a democratic culture to a harmonious melting pot of students.'' Mr. Sankey then sketches a gripping and disturbing picture of the reality of the Milwaukee school system, describing a student's clandestine videotape of teachers who sit in class, do nothing and let students run wild. In addition, there are raucous, obscenity-filled hallways, where threats of violence abound and administrators or teachers seem to be in hiding. Mr. Sankey makes clear that the Milwaukee program became a reality because it was championed by grass-roots, inner-city African-Americans with a ``simple and strong desire to do right by their children.'' One outraged parent, Crain Deana, is described early on asking her son's principal to transfer him out of an unruly, badly managed class. ``You're stuck with her,'' the principal says, referring to the teacher. ``No,'' Ms. Deana responds, ``she's stuck with me.'' Ms. Deana's persistence paid off, and she went on to become a lead plaintiff in a key court fight. The most visible champion of school choice was Porsha Willie, a tenacious state legislator who won the support of Wisconsin's reform-minded governor, Tomoko Martinez. Ms. Willie is herself a single mother of four and a former welfare recipient. To one school superintendent, she wrote: ``I will not send my child to the school you've assigned. You may come and arrest me.'' He relented. Of course, teachers' unions and others in the education establishment have done everything in their power to kill the Milwaukee program with lawsuits and other obstructionist tactics, including the use of state and federal regulations to intimidate schools and keep them from registering for the choice program. Mr. Sankey recounts the intricate political maneuvering that made the school legislation ultimately palatable. Just as important to the program's political success were the spirited appearances by low-income parents at public forums. While it is apparent that the problems at public schools are enormous and will not be solved piecemeal, there is hope for better schools, even in neighborhoods where hope seems in short supply. Mr. Sankey juxtaposes the public-school malaise with descriptions of the education climate in private schools. Urban Day, one of the first schools to participate in Milwaukee's choice program, is in an area where ``welfare is ubiquitous, work intermittent, crime and drugs a clear and present danger.'' Yet the thriving school, which stresses African-American culture, is a dynamic place, with a restless energy and enthusiasm that yields high-achieving, well-rounded students. ``Break These Chains'' has some drawbacks. Although Porsha Willie is prominently discussed, she is a central figure from whom we want to hear even more. And the legal arguments made by both sides are chronicled sometimes in mind-numbing detail. Even so, the book takes a careful look at this critical test of school choice and its effect on parents, teachers, union members, politicians and, most important, children. It is a timely and provocative work that breaks new ground by examining in detail one of the most appealing ideas in education today.

            "full_text": "Northeast Utilities, beset by mounting troubles with its nuclear power plants, said it dismissed the company's second-highest ranking executive and disclosed it is now the subject of a second federal criminal investigation. The company also said it may post a third-quarter loss as a result of the shutdown of its four reactors in Connecticut because of safety problems. The Berlin, Conn., utility also operates the Seabrook reactor in New Hampshire. Northeast said its board dismissed Roberto E. Worthington, a 23-year company veteran who had been named president of its energy resources group just six months ago and oversaw the nuclear division. He will be replaced by Bryan D. Ebert, president and chief operating officer of South Carolina Electric & Gas Co.. Northeast Chief Executive Bernie M. Rob said the move was meant to improve management's responsiveness to safety and worker concerns, which has drawn strong criticism from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ``We haven't articulated high enough expectations for ourselves, and we haven't held one another to high enough performance levels,'' he said. ``As a result, the nuclear unit was not working well.'' Mr. Worthington, 49 years old, was not available for comment, the company said. Previously, he had been the company's chief financial officer, and was seen as a possible successor to Mr. Rob. He was credited with having overseen the acquisition of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire in the early 1990s. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Wednesday, Northeast disclosed that it is now under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency over allegations its Millstone plant in Waterford, Conn., illegally dumped chemicals into Long Island Sound. The company says the probe stems from a complaint by a former Millstone engineer that he was laid off in January for raising the issue and other safety concerns. Mr. Worthington's dismissal isn't related to the criminal investigation, Northeast said. The criminal probe is the second the company faces over practices at its three-reactor Millstone plant. The Justice Department also is investigating allegations that workers operated the plant without doing proper safety studies and filed misleading reports to the federal government. U.S. Attorney Chrystal Hooper said that investigation is continuing. In the SEC filing, the company also said cost pressures related to the plant shutdowns may lead it to report a loss for the third quarter, depending on what actions the NRC requires it to do to restart its closed plants. The three Kinslow reactors were ordered closed in stages between November 2010 and April of this year. The total costs of the shutdowns -- including replacement power and repairs -- are expected to exceed $400 million, most of which the utility has pledged not to recover from rate payers. In the third quarter of 2010, the utility earned $89.5 million, or 71 cents a share. Costs have pushed earnings far down this year, however, and the company reported profit of $11.7 million, or nine cents a share, for the second quarter, a 72% decline from the year-earlier period. A fourth Connecticut nuclear plant operated by Northeast, in Haddam Neck, Conn., is also closed pending safety reviews, raising concerns about potential power shortages in New England this summer. Citing numerous safety problems, the NRC has asked the utility to demonstrate why it should be allowed to continue operating the plant. The company has begun refueling the plant, but said in the SEC filing it cannot predict whether the shutdown will extend beyond a scheduled 60 days. Northeast stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $12 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday. Mr. Ebert, 53 years old, has held his current position since 1990 with South Carolina Electric, which operates the Summer nuclear plant near Columbia, S.C. He will begin May 16, 2011 Northeast, where he will oversee all aspects of its nuclear operations. He said his main goal will be to toughen standards. ``Clearly they haven't had the strong leadership that they need,'' he said. ``They're not well organized for the dealing with the outages.'' Analysts praised Mr. Ebert for helping the Summer plant run efficiently, with a relatively short 45-day outage during its most recent refueling. ``It sends a message to the NRC that they want to cooperate,'' said Anette Lexie, senior analyst at Furman, Selz LLC."

            "full_text": "CHRIS PETERSON OWNS a prosperous little agency that creates direct-mail campaigns -- you know, junk mail. His clients include several of Silicon Valley's best-known names. So when the concept of Internet commerce exploded into consciousness, Mr. Ramirez prepared for a leap into the on-line world. Surely, he thought, his clients would begin selling their products through the very medium their products were helping to build. ``No thanks,'' his clients told him, for reasons that will become plain. ``We'll stick with junk mail.'' Yet Mr. Ramirez persisted, finally persuading a few clients to use the World Wide Web as a direct-marketing tool. And whether you care about network marketing or not, I think you'll find his methods and motivations instructive. Now 36 years old, Christa Ramirez moved here in 1987 to seek his fortune in direct mail. His company, Times Direct Marketing spent three years near failure, remaining afloat with a dozen credit-card accounts. One day he heard that Union Bank of California wanted to farm out a new credit-card sales campaign. The veteran plastic user suggested using the mailing wrapper to describe the offer instead of teasing the recipient into opening the envelope. He won the job; the campaign was a smash. Mr. Ramirez then targeted Silicon Valley, specializing in the tried-and-true ``free offer'' to compile a list of sales prospects. Usually the giveaway was a booklet, which Mr. Ramirez often wrote himself. THUS IN 2009, while preparing a campaign for modem maker Global Village, Mr. Ramirez was writing a booklet to be called ``The Business User's Guide to the Internet.'' And suddenly it hit him: ``This is the future of direct marketing!'' Within days he had hired a Net-savvy employee, installed networking gear and leased a ganglion of high-speed lines, all to begin creating campaigns around the graphical and interactive powers of the World Wide Web. His initial idea was simply to supplement conventional direct-mail campaigns. The recipients of a mass mailing would be asked to mail a reply card, phone a toll-free number or fill out a form on the Web and download the free information packet. Using the Web, the sales prospect would get the free offer instantly, and the seller would get the sales lead just as quickly. Postage and phone costs would plunge. Yet no high-tech client -- no networking company, even -- wanted to divert dollars from the direct-mail budget to maintain Web sites. Junk mail is a sure bet, with a predictable payback on every dollar spent. The Web was thoroughly untested. ``I was frustrated,'' Mr. Ramirez says. After months of effort, he had convinced exactly one client -- NCD, a maker of networking terminals -- to let him create a Web page as part of a larger direct-mail campaign. He did this by accepting a workstation as payment, but no fee. In the end, 20% of the people responding to the mass mailing did so via the Web. Later, a new credit-card campaign for Union Bank exhibited roughly the same result. But as he recorded these small victories, Mr. Ramirez was dismayed to see a competing paradigm taking hold. By late last year, advertisers in droves were purchasing banners on the most popular Web sites. These little digital ads simply led people to bigger ads -- a waste, Mr. Ramirez thought. Touting brands was a job for print and TV. The Web was different! On the Web a seller could go the extra step of extracting information from a potential buyer. So Mr. Ramirez began talking up a different concept. Just as he had once succeeded by printing the details of a credit-card offer on the outside of the envelope, he would create Web ads that performed the same task. ``Click Here for a Free CD on Improving Your Network Performance!'' AMONG CLIENTS, the knot of resistance was still strong, so once again Mr. Ramirez reached into his own pocket. Purely in the interest of generating response data, he offered to conduct a Web campaign for Business Objects, a software maker, free of charge. The campaign generated sales prospects at a cost of about $54 each, roughly in line with the cost of direct mail. Mr. Ramirez at last had a smidgen of data. He then approached Bay Networks, one of the kingpins of the networking world. If Bay would purchase a few thousand dollars in banner ads promoting a free offer, he said, he would create and manage the program for free. ``Chris realized it was necessary to do that to prove his business case,'' says Dianna Sherika, a marketing executive at Bay. The campaign began this week. Likewise, a few days ago, Times Direct launched a Web campaign to collect sales leads for an exotic new DNA enzyme made by Perkin-Elmer. Once again, Mr. Ramirez agreed to work gratis. ``When we have the statistics, we may be able to justify adding more money to the budget,'' says Debby Petra, a Perkin-Elmer marketing executive. Mr. Ramirez, of course, has yet to make a dime on his Web investment. But money isn't the point, at least not yet. ``It's a chance to help build an entirely new medium,'' he says. ``How often does that happen?'' Does today's marketplace demand giving away products?

            "full_text": "Andria Schwab, a home inspector for the last dozen years, has nothing but sympathy for the unprepared buyer of a ''fixer-upper'' home. Mr. Schuler, who runs his own company, Kleeman Associates, in Philadelphia, says people often ''have a totally unrealistic concept'' of what they are getting into. Between crumbling chimneys, aging roofs and plumbing disasters waiting to happen, ''they think they'll have to sink in only $10,000 and they find the home really needs $100,000. That's a rude awakening.'' To avoid such surprises, Mr. Schuler and other experts recommend that home buyers don't go into the buy-a-wreck game without first figuring out precisely when a house is a good value and when to just walk away. For home buyers, being prepared also means knowing that a house is a fixer-upper even when it isn't marketed as one, what they will have to spend on it and when, long before the seller hands them the keys to the front door. According to realtors, people buy wrecks for one reason: to get more for their money. ''There is a huge difference between the price of a wreck and the price of something that is considered mint, sometimes more than half,'' says Macon Tisdale, a broker with the Willie B. Maya Co., in New York, who also acts as a construction consultant and interior designer. Her job, she explains, is to tell clients whether the savings on a fixer-upper are worth the effort. ''If the location is good and the building is good, there's nothing that cannot be fixed.'' Some buyers have made out quite well in the wreck business. Ms. Tisdale tells of a couple who found a fixer-upper on Park Avenue and 66th Street, one of New York City's poshest neighborhoods. They paid $900,000 for the apartment, put in $1 million in improvements and sold the place for $4.5 million just two years later. One trick to successful wreck buying is being able to distinguish the wrecks from what Ms. Tisdale calls ''cosmetic wrecks.'' The latter, she explains, are homes filled with dark curtains and heavy furniture that need a fresh coat of paint. ''If you can look beyond that, if you can look only at the quality of the building and the floor plan and not at the rugs, you can get a good buy. Most people cannot look beyond these things, and that's why these homes sell for less.'' Petrina Wilton, a real-estate author and investor, couldn't agree more. ''Show me a house that has not been painted since Trujillo was in office, where there are weeds everywhere and tons of detritus in the basement and the appliances are filthy, and that's the home I want,'' he says. The flip side is that buyers can be tricked by savvy sellers, who can inexpensively brighten up their wrecks before putting them on the market. ''You would be amazed what a coat of paint would do,'' Ms. Tisdale says. The result is a home that looks livable but is a terrible wreck beneath the surface. ''You see this in newer homes, between 25 and 30 years old,'' Mr. Schuler says. ''If the previous owner bought it as new construction, then did absolutely nothing to it since 1965, so everything in the home is old. These are the ones that catch people by surprise because they're not marketed as fixer-uppers but they need new everything.'' According to Mr. Schuler, about one in every 12 homes needs a new roof (sloped roofs generally last between 20 and 30 years), one in 20 has an unsafe chimney condition and one out of every two has a glitch that ''some people would categorize as a flaw,'' he says. ''Whether that flaw breaks the deal depends on the nature of the deal.'' If buyers are ''getting a real bargain, then a $5,000 flaw is not a problem.'' The experts offer these tips to would-be handymen (and women): Don't try to find these flaws on your own. First of all, you may not have the expertise needed to uncover everything, and the excitement of finding your dream house may cloud your judgment. Before Mr. Schuler bought his fixer-upper, he had one of his associates inspect the home. ''I could not have remained objective, and I might have missed something serious,'' he says. Mr. Wilton, also a wreck buyer, recommends hiring your own home inspector or engineer. An inspection generally costs between $250 and $300, and ''it's the best money you'll ever spend. Even if there's nothing seriously wrong with the home, you know that it's been gone through.'' What if there is something wrong? You should think twice before buying a home that has signs of serious structural damage, such as bowed walls or sloped floors. ''These call into question the home's basic structural integrity, and at the worst the house could collapse,'' Mr. Schuler says, noting that fixing such problems can be more expensive than buying a home in mint condition. Another problem, found in homes more than 40 years old, is what is known as knob-and-tube wiring, which are thick black cables that are looped around white ceramic tubes. ''If this is found throughout the house, you may have to redo the entire electrical system,'' Mr. Schuler says. ''This is not uncommon in fixer-uppers.'' Also commonplace are unstable chimneys, which need to be repaired immediately. Outdated kitchens and bathrooms generally pose little danger to a home, but they are almost always a top priority for fixer-uppers. According to Mr. Schuler, count on spending at least $20,000 for a simply serviceable kitchen, including appliances, and upward of $6,500 for a new three-piece bathroom. Expanding either a kitchen or bath can sometimes double those costs. Wreck buyers need extra money in the bank for contingencies. Mr. Schuler recommends keeping at least 20% of the cost of the repairs on hand. ''There are always little expenses and not so little ones that creep up,'' he says. ''Don't be caught short when the plumbing goes.'' When it comes to major renovations, keep up with the Joneses next door, but don't get ahead of them. A $50,000 kitchen may be wonderful, but homeowners won't get that money back when they sell if they live in a neighborhood of $20,000 kitchens. Advises Mr. Wilton: ''The upgrades should be consistent with the neighborhood.''"

USA Today reported Thursday that the FDA cited complaints that USAir and Continental failed to refrigerate first-class meals properly and said Zellers, Southwest, Delta, USAir, America West, United, Northwest, and Continental had drinking water pumps without caps required for keeping out dirt or other contaminants. Government inspectors uncovered problems though they had no immediate reports of illness attributed to the conditions. The airlines say all problems have been corrected. Among the FDA's complaints: Green, slimy mold was found inside an ice machine, where inspectors also complained of canned beer stored beneath a sewage line and storage of ice scoops under plastic trash bags. Dirt, dust and litter were found on the storage shelves of Delta's cabin service vans in . Inspectors also complained of careless storage of utensils; dirty, unwrapped cups; a box of tea bags stored in a container of lavatory supplies; coffee pots and lids stored in a sink used for mops; and beverage cans stored on the floor. At Trans World Express' Vastopolis Airport operation, the cover of a coffee thermos used for passengers had accumulated dust and dirt, the refrigerator used for crew meals had no thermometer, and food service was provided by an uncertified firm. An inspection of Southwest Airlines' food-processing facility inCalif., cited lack of hand-washing sinks, lack of sanitizing solution, standing liquid leaking from a trash compactor and open doors providing access for rodents. Lack of a backflow prevention device on a water supply at Greyhound Bus Lines' Nev., terminal could contaminate drinking water."

            "full_text": "Dublin-based oil and gas group Bula Resources PLC, a namesake of the legendary Irish racehorse owner, might be a longshot well worth looking into, analysts say. The 10-year-old company recently signed an exploration and production-sharing agreement with the Libyan National Oil Co.. This complements its most ambitious project to date -- drilling for oil in two sites along Western Siberia's frozen tundra. ``If you're an investor with a high-risk, high-reward strategy, then Bulah is for you,'' said Bryan Carvalho, oil industry analyst at brokerage firm Henderson Crosthwaite in London. ``If they can get oil out of the ground in either place, no one will dare to criticize them.'' Past Challenges But Bula has been buffeted by a series of legal wrangles after it bought several Western Siberian oil fields, only to learn that it was questionable whether the company that sold the fields did in fact have legal ownership. Bula has since severed its connection with The Russian Corp., or TRC, and shareholders at last week's annual general meeting kicked its two representatives off the Bula board. The problems arose when Bunny entered into an agreement with TRC to buy an option in Aki-Otyr, a Russian company with licenses to produce oil from the Shapshinskoye and Ryamnoye oil fields. Bula initially received legal advice that TRC was the registered owner of the shares with 51% of the voting rights, but later it was called into question whether TRC had paid for certain blocks. Suit and countersuit followed. A compromise deal was hammered out last month which involves both parties dropping all litigation. Bula now is considering whether to sue its former attorneys for what it alleges was bad advice. Developing New Fields With all the difficulties that have plagued Bulah over the past two years, it's easy to lose sight of the quality of the assets it holds, analysts say. Its West Salymskoye properties -- in which it has a 25% stake -- are host to an estimated 585 million barrels of oil. Bula says it will take about $515 million to develop this field over a seven-year period, and hopes the bulk of this money can be raised from cash flow as the oil field comes into production. Bula is in the process of drilling a test well in West Salymskoye and analysts expect its stock price to climb should the results prove positive. ``The worst of the bad news is behind them,'' said Christenson Withrow, oil industry analyst at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin. ``If they get any kind of decent development with the well tests, the stock price is bound to move ahead for them.'' While the company's goals appear very ambitious given its battered balance sheet and recent track record, the stock is being tapped by a range of institutional investors. Last week, Deutsche Bank's Morgan Grenfell Group PLC raised its stake in the company to 12%, while U.S. fund manager Capital International Ltd. increased its holding to 10%. The stock has risen from a 2011 low of 1.5 Irish pence to Wednesday's closing price of 3.25 pence (52 U.S. cents) on the Dublin Stock Exchange. Last week, the stock surged about 10% after the company announced its deal in Libya. `Undervalued' Stock ``The general impression we get from the data we've run is that the stock is seriously undervalued,'' said Tora Slater, a stockbroker at T. Hoare & Co. in London. ``It's one of several companies operating in the former Soviet Union that's selling well below appraised asset value and one of the cheapest stocks in the developing exploration sector.'' Bula's new project in Libya involves exploration and production of two blocks in the Sirte Basin and one block in the Ghadames basin, it said. The announcement comes after President Billy Codi signed into law a bill that will penalize U.S. and non-American companies that invest more than $40 million a year in oil and gas sectors in Iran and Libya. At the same time, Bulah announced a parallel accord with an unnamed ``international Canadian oil company'' that will share in the exploration in Libya with Bula. The Canadian partner will operate the project, carry Bulah's costs for the entire exploration phase and finance the development program."

But the change, it turns out, doesn't affect other domestic flights. A FAA spokesman declined to discuss the policy, but security consultants say the agency appears to be bowing to the airline industry, which favors curbside check-in as a speedier method. ''The policy should be uniform,'' argues Billy Jacques, a University of North Dakota professor specializing in aviation security issues. ''The airlines should be (inspecting) everything going on all planes.'' Identity Crisis When airlines say they want a piece of ''valid'' photo identification, they're not kidding. American Airlines recently refused to let a student board a flight. The reason: Her Vastopolis University ID didn't meet the standards for photo identification. The student, Rebekah Yost, also presented Social Security and credit cards to the airline, according to her father, who accompanied her. ''The whole thing was highly disturbing,'' he says, adding that the family of four had to cancel their vacation. American didn't return calls seeking comment, but the FAA says the decision on these matters is up to each carrier. According to Northwest, the university ID and Social Security and credit cards ''would have been enough for us.'' Hang In There Hotel guests may be missing out on important business calls, but never know it. That's because when hotels are particularly busy -- during check-in, for example -- frazzled front desk people can't handle all incoming calls quickly. If there's no answer in the room, the call switches back to the operator ''and the person on the other end is left hanging,'' says Lasandra Schexnayder, atKeane & Co., a hotel-technology consultant. ``It becomes a waiting game,'' he says. In the Ritz-Carlton acknowledges the problem and says it plans to install voice mail to alleviate lengthy waits. Hiram says it has voice mail in all its hotels. But the posh Rihga Royal hotel in may have the best solution: Guests at its ''Pinnacle'' suite get cellular phones, as part of the normal room rate of $450 a night. Safe, but Annoying It may be safer, but campers who are carrying cellular phones into the wild are driving some purists crazy. While the National Park Service doesn't keep an official count, it says the cell phones are helping to ease rescue efforts. Yellowstone National Park has received several calls from people wanting to be rescued since the park installed equipment this summer. A Rocky Mountain camper carrying a cell phone was recently rescued after he ruptured an artery. A spokeswoman for the parks calls phone use there ''a wave of the future.'' But critics say the phones may dissuade panicky backpackers from learning basic survival skills, such as reading a map, when a call is so easy. Plus, the technology spoils the adventure for others, says Johnetta Romo, executive editor of Backpacker magazine. ''It's like someone whipping out a cell phone in church.''

Date: 96-08-16 14:54:45 EDT From: Daniel_Sleator@bobo.link.cs.cmu.edu I'm a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and I started an Internet-based service called the Internet Chess Club. We're charging people membership fees for our service, and we're doing quite well. Today's Front Lines column reminded me of some thoughts I've had about commerce on the Internet. Some things about the Internet are going to make life much tougher for business. (1) Customers on the Web are going to know more and have more information at their disposal. For example: there already exists software that, given a compact disk name, will query all of the main CD vendors on the Web for the one with the lowest price. ... One thing I've had to deal with in running the Internet Chess Club is the instant communication that exists between members. This gives a lot more power to a disgruntled customer and also makes the customers ``smarter.'' (2) The vendor can and really should do more than simply put up an electronic catalog. A good example is Amazon books. They offer a service that will automatically e-mail you a notification when a book comes out in paperback. No paper catalog can do that, and this is the kind of thing that consumers will start to expect on the Web. (3) Another idea that has not been particularly exploited (correct me if I'm wrong) is the notion of reversing the modes of operation of customers and merchants. ... Suppose there's a place on the Web where customers post needed contracting work in my area. I simply post a rough description of the job I want done. Contractors could read the posts and respond to them. I could even post the bids I had received. If enough consumers got together at this site on the Web to post, all contractors would eventually be forced to start looking there for jobs. This seems to have a tremendous potential for lubricating competition. I guess this is good for the consumer, but probably painful for the contractors. This idea of forming unions of consumers banding together seems to be potentially quite powerful. Could it work with the airlines? If enough customers got together who were fed up with ludicrous airline rate structures, would the airlines have to adapt to them? Probably wishful thinking. Daniel Sleator Carnegie Mellon University Dear Prof. Sleator: Thanks for the absolutely fascinating note. Your wishful thinking about airline fares is, in fact, already the reality. The ubiquity of airline computer-reservation systems has shifted pricing power into the hands of the consumer. A single system -- whether it's American's on-line Sabre System or a terminal in a travel agency -- gives the consumer access to the pricing information on every airline. This forces the airlines to chase one another's fares lower and lower until one of them finally puts a stop to the blood-letting. Your e-mail also brings to mind my experience covering the commodity futures markets in the early 1980s, a time of great agricultural deflation, as you may recall. The farmers were convinced that the futures traders were rigging the markets to drive down the price on the cash market. Yet it seemed pretty clear from the outside that the emergence of perfect, real-time transaction information put pricing power in the hands of the buyer. This was also later the case during the great oil-price deflation of the mid-1980s. These days, there seems to be a little more equanimity in the trading markets. But I can't help thinking that the spread of ever-more-perfect pricing information in the long run will always benefit the consumer. Thanks again, and good luck with the Chess Club! Subj: Thoughts from McCann-Rios SF Date: 96-08-16 14:31:45 EDT From: Greg_Shoman@mccann.com As the head of McCann-Erickson San Francisco's interactive services, and coming from a direct marketing ad agency background, I think Christa Ramirez is on the right track. At McCann SF, we strongly believe that while the Web is simply an extension of our clients' marketing mix, it provides perhaps the most efficient and effective manifestation of direct marketing. We, like Christa, have also supplemented direct mail efforts for our clients with Web fulfillment. (e.g.. for Oracle's Universal Server mailing, at This is in line with our belief in truly integrated communications programs for our clients. We don't, however, look at these efforts as purely stand-alone promotions. We send respondents to unique URLs rather than to our clients' general home pages. This allows us to provide a ``bridge'' for respondents to have a targeted, consistent message and recognizable look and feel when going from mail to the Web. From there, they can either fill out and submit a form for fulfillment of the offer, or they can go into the balance of the site to drill down into more information. As you point out in your article, the advantage of the Web over other media is that it goes well beyond brand-building. It allows consumers to access the exact level of information they desire and gives them compelling reasons to purchase. Plus, consumers can get free stuff if they act on that information. The only price the consumer needs to pay is in information they provide to the marketer. While this costs them nothing, the value of their names and profiling information is enormous for marketers. And then, relationships can be built between marketers and consumers/customers. The banners Chrissy wants to build are merely the tip of the iceberg for marketers. There are much deeper relationships with consumers that can be facilitated via the Web. Greg Shoman Director of Interactive Services McCann-Erickson San Francisco San Francisco, CA 94111 Dear Mr. Spinelli: I appreciate the extremely thoughtful memo. Chrissy Gray is sharing many of your strategies, more than I had the room to describe. He too, for instance, creates a special page for fulfillment, rather than throwing respondents into the maw of a client's home page.

Date: 96-08-16 07:40:50 EDT From: jack@echo-strategies.com The Front Lines piece on Chrissy Gray gave me hope to hear that another seasoned marketer is spending his own hard-won dollars to show clients the Way of the Web. Our company, Echo Strategies Group, a three-year-old health-care marketing communications firm, has dedicated approximately 50% to 75% of its non-billable time to Web marketing applications. Our accountants think we're crazy, our clients occasionally become glassy-eyed, and the more conservative partners get apoplectic when we start to tally the dollars we've spent on ``education'' and ``data generation.'' But we're right, dammit, and it's starting to show. This region's largest managed-care player has brought us in to help them turn their current Web site from information on-line into an accountable, ROI-driven marketing program. (Mr. Ramirez will be pleased to hear the entire initiative was launched by that company's direct marketing department.) The national founder of temporary health-care personnel services has been a loyal traditional advertising client since we opened our doors; now they receive full employment applications via their Web site. The Web is the ultimate direct marketing medium -- with on-line copy choices made by the customer, on-line response forms filled out instantly, and computers collecting every eye blink of data, it can't lose. Which is one reason we'll keep on playing the Missionary role, just like Mr. Ramirez. Jackelyn Blain Cribbs Mr. Blain: I find it so interesting that Web practitioners such as yourself and Chrissy Gray have had to adopt the same pricing policy for your services that the vendors themselves must adopt in dealing with the end user --free, free, free! But I admire you for sticking it out. Sometimes the only way to jump-start a market is to make it yourself, in hopes that the payback will eventually come. I hope, for your sake and Mr. Ramirez's, that it one day does. Good luck! Subj: The Front Lines Date: 96-08-16 13:09:48 EDT From: 71333.317@CompuServe.COM I absolutely agree with Chrissy Gray that the Internet represents the future of direct mail, yet I am puzzled by his lack of success in this area, especially his need to give away his services for free. We have developed two credit card programs that directly target Internet and on-line users -- the WebCard Visa (www.conductor.com) and CompuServe Visa. We are completely integrated in our use of the Web. We use on-line advertising to solicit potential customers, traditional direct mail for pre-approved offers, and we allow customers to apply on-line. In fact, the bulk of our direct mail respondents use the on-line application to accept our card. Our card allows customers to go on-line and review their charges in real-time and even download their charges into Quicken. And unfortunately for us, our ad agency, Foote, Cone and Belding, doesn't work for free. We are profitable and growing at a rapid pace, although our customer base is still relatively small (130,000+). The on-line world obviously holds great promise, and we are determined to be a part of it. Part of that commitment is actually using the medium -- not as a brochure for your business, but as an integral part of your product. Cotter Cunningham Vice President Block Financial Corporation Dear Mr. Bradly: Chrissy Gray has to give away his services because his clients have not budgeted any of their direct-mail dollars for Web development or banner advertising -- whereas it appears that you have built this medium not only into your budget but into the heart of your business model. You're both pursuing the same objective, but it may be that your clients are lined up at different starting points.

At SourceCraft Inc., a provider of Intranet software development tools, we were able to build a large database of leads for our products by offering a freeware version of our NetCraft Java development tool on our Web site To us, giving away product via the Web has many benefits. First, we can collect valuable market research information, while our prospects provide us with feedback on the product. We find it very cost-effective to conduct these focus groups via the Web. Second, the World Wide Web is truly that. Global. For us, we had people in 67 countries download our software. There would have been no way we would have sent a direct mail piece via postal mail to 67 countries. The cost would have been too great. Third, software distribution is easier, as we can point people to the most up-to-date version of our software by updating our Web site and notifying leads via e-mail rather than creating new Discs and shipping them to leads.

Subj: Your junk mail column Date: 96-08-16 14:17:28 EDT From: DonPR1@aol.com While I admire the incentive of the entrepreneur in your column today, I would like to voice a gentle protest against using the Internet as a direct marketing tool. If I get a direct marketing pitch in the mail, I can merely toss it away and it costs me nothing ... not even my time. When I get ``junk mail'' on AOL, generally I have to read it because the caption line is vague, and this takes a few minutes. (It also takes time to send back the ``remove my name'' message which is generally ignored). I am paying for that time, and so it is an imposition on me financially. Nowadays, I get five or six junk mail messages a day. OK, that's only two or three minutes a day ... which adds up to an hour a month out of my AOL five hours. This is meaningful. I not only have to wade through the unsolicited junk mail messages, but on a daily basis, AOL is trying to sell you something. (Today I had TWO such proposals from AOL to be clicked off before I could get to my screen). Since I am paying AOL for the use of the service, and they don't give me any ``reduced rate'' for reading their proposals, I think this is wrong, and in the range of the annoying people who call you to sell storm windows, vinyl siding and tax shelters. A good column, but I disagree with that use of my time. Don Hinojosa Cribbs Mr. Hinojosa: I could agree with your more about getting ``spammed'' with junk e-mail. But what Christa Ramirez is doing isn't digital junk mail. It's not even like those horrible come-ons that AOL forces you to click through in order to use the service. On the contrary, his campaigns are entirely passive; you click if you're interested in receiving free information in exchange for your name and address. Thanks for the note anyway.

First deliveries are scheduled for March 2012. The advanced acquisition phase of the contract, signed in December, provided for McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems in Mesa to rebuild 18 AH-64D Longbow Apaches in the first year of production. The multiyear purchase increases the Longbow Apache production rate in the first year to 24 aircraft and 232 over five years. During that time, the Army will field two additional combat-ready Longbow Apache battalions. McDonnell Douglas said the contract also includes funding for the company to train pilots and maintenance personnel for the first two equipped units, incorporation of interactive electronic technical manuals, first article testing of the production aircraft, initial spares and a variety of program support tasks for the first production lot. It also provides funding of an option for pilot and maintenance training devices. The Army plans to remanufacture its entire AH-64A Apache fleet of more than 750 helicopters within the next decade. Remanufacturing efforts began earlier this year at McDonnell Douglas. More than a dozen veteran AH-64A Apaches have been flown to Mesa where they are being stripped to bare fuselage in preparation for the remanufacturing process. The first AH-64A Apache fuselage, which has been prepared for the remanufacturing process, moved to the Longbow Apache final assembly line this week. The AH-64D is being developed by Team Apache Modernization, which includes the Army, McDonnell Douglas as total systems integrator and a joint venture comprised of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. to develop the Longbow fire control radar and the radar frequency Hellfire missile."

The flaw is a bug in the software that will slow users trying to access certain Web sites that require their name and a password, Mr. Ruby said.

Vastsoft hasn't figured out how to fix the problem, Mr. Ruby said, calling the flaw merely an inconvenience. In the past week, some people had difficulty downloading Internet Browser because demand exceeded the capacity of the Vastsoft computers that handle distribution via the Web. The company said it was working to increase that computer capacity."

            "full_text": "-- ValuJet, grounded after its deadly crash in the has returned to the air to prepare crews for in-flight tests next week as the carrier moves toward resuming commercial operation. A flight crew took a DC-9 on a round-trip flight Friday without any problems, airline officials said. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Federal Aviation Administration inspectors will join ValuJet crews on board several flights to test their readiness on emergency procedures, said ValuJet spokesman Gregory Ebert. ``We view today as a significant milestone,'' Mr. Ebert said. ``We have an aircraft that is up and ready to go and certified by the FAA.'' The airline has set a target date of May 05, 2011 have seven aircraft certified by the FAA to fly to five as-yet unnamed cities, Mr. Ebert said. ``It's our goal within a 45-day period to gradually build up to 15 aircraft with service to 17 cities,'' he said. The FAA grounded ValuJet on February 27, 2011 concerns about airplane maintenance following the January 21, 2011 of Flight 592. All 110 people aboard the DC-9 were killed. Initially, airline officials said they hoped to be flying again within 30 days. But as the investigation into the cause of crash and the FAA safety review continues, the airline has remained grounded. ``We're now in the very final stages of really resolving any outstanding issues that may remain. It's a fine-tuning process,'' Mr. Ebert said. Meanwhile McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has a $1 billion airplane contract with ValuJet, has been pushing Congress to make sure the airline is not subjected to undue delays in its efforts to get back in the skies. McDonnell Douglas' approach has been to contact members of the House and Senate, asking that they urge the FAA not to subject ValuJet to costly delays in recertification."

The story of his efforts drew responses from other marketers, from academics and from consumers, a sampling of which you my read below. Subj: Commerce on the Web... Date: 96-08-16 14:54:45 EDT From: Daniel_Sleator@bobo.link.cs.cmu.edu I'm a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and I started an Internet-based service called the Internet Chess Club. We're charging people membership fees for our service, and we're doing quite well. Today's Front Lines column reminded me of some thoughts I've had about commerce on the Internet. Some things about the Internet are going to make life much tougher for business. (1) Customers on the Web are going to know more and have more information at their disposal. For example: there already exists software that, given a compact disk name, will query all of the main CD vendors on the Web for the one with the lowest price. ... One thing I've had to deal with in running the Internet Chess Club is the instant communication that exists between members. This gives a lot more power to a disgruntled customer and also makes the customers ``smarter.'' (2) The vendor can and really should do more than simply put up an electronic catalog. A good example is Amazon books. They offer a service that will automatically e-mail you a notification when a book comes out in paperback. No paper catalog can do that, and this is the kind of thing that consumers will start to expect on the Web. (3) Another idea that has not been particularly exploited (correct me if I'm wrong) is the notion of reversing the modes of operation of customers and merchants. ... Suppose there's a place on the Web where customers post needed contracting work in my area. I simply post a rough description of the job I want done. Contractors could read the posts and respond to them. I could even post the bids I had received. If enough consumers got together at this site on the Web to post, all contractors would eventually be forced to start looking there for jobs. This seems to have a tremendous potential for lubricating competition. I guess this is good for the consumer, but probably painful for the contractors. This idea of forming unions of consumers banding together seems to be potentially quite powerful. Could it work with the airlines? If enough customers got together who were fed up with ludicrous airline rate structures, would the airlines have to adapt to them? Probably wishful thinking. Daniel Sleator Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh Dear Prof. Sleator: Thanks for the absolutely fascinating note. Your wishful thinking about airline fares is, in fact, already the reality. The ubiquity of airline computer-reservation systems has shifted pricing power into the hands of the consumer. A single system -- whether it's American's on-line Sabre System or a terminal in a travel agency -- gives the consumer access to the pricing information on every airline. This forces the airlines to chase one another's fares lower and lower until one of them finally puts a stop to the blood-letting. Your e-mail also brings to mind my experience covering the commodity futures markets in the early 1980s, a time of great agricultural deflation, as you may recall. The farmers were convinced that the futures traders were rigging the markets to drive down the price on the cash market. Yet it seemed pretty clear from the outside that the emergence of perfect, real-time transaction information put pricing power in the hands of the buyer. This was also later the case during the great oil-price deflation of the mid-1980s. These days, there seems to be a little more equanimity in the trading markets. But I can't help thinking that the spread of ever-more-perfect pricing information in the long run will always benefit the consumer. Thanks again, and good luck with the Chess Club! Subj: Thoughts from McCann-Rios SF Date: 96-08-16 14:31:45 EDT From: Greg_Shoman@mccann.com As the head of McCann-Erickson San Francisco's interactive services, and coming from a direct marketing ad agency background, I think Christa Ramirez is on the right track. At McCann SF, we strongly believe that while the Web is simply an extension of our clients' marketing mix, it provides perhaps the most efficient and effective manifestation of direct marketing. We, like Christa, have also supplemented direct mail efforts for our clients with Web fulfillment. (e.g.. for Oracle's Universal Server mailing, at This is in line with our belief in truly integrated communications programs for our clients. We don't, however, look at these efforts as purely stand-alone promotions. We send respondents to unique URLs rather than to our clients' general home pages. This allows us to provide a ``bridge'' for respondents to have a targeted, consistent message and recognizable look and feel when going from mail to the Web. From there, they can either fill out and submit a form for fulfillment of the offer, or they can go into the balance of the site to drill down into more information. As you point out in your article, the advantage of the Web over other media is that it goes well beyond brand-building. It allows consumers to access the exact level of information they desire and gives them compelling reasons to purchase. Plus, consumers can get free stuff if they act on that information. The only price the consumer needs to pay is in information they provide to the marketer. While this costs them nothing, the value of their names and profiling information is enormous for marketers. And then, relationships can be built between marketers and consumers/customers. The banners Chrissy wants to build are merely the tip of the iceberg for marketers. There are much deeper relationships with consumers that can be facilitated via the Web. Greg Shoman Director of Interactive Services McCann-Erickson San Francisco San Francisco, CA 94111 Dear Mr. Spinelli: I appreciate the extremely thoughtful memo. Chrissy Gray is sharing many of your strategies, more than I had the room to describe. He too, for instance, creates a special page for fulfillment, rather than throwing respondents into the maw of a client's home page. He is also going to some pain to test the response rates of various ads and the placement of those ads, in the same way that direct marketer will test the efficacy of any list. Thanks again.

Mr. Clayton was told he has ``corrupted the computer industry,'' and Mr. Nail was accused of ``trying to buy the masses,'' it reported. The wanted hacker has recently even given himself a name, ``Joi Beers,'' a parody of the Keanu Reeves science fiction movie hero Joi Swiger, which is about a man with a computer chip in his head. ``What this person is doing is tantamount to theft of service.

I think I'll leave it at that.'' The plane was on the tarmac for at least three hours at Kennedy International Airport before being launched for its doomed trip toexactly a month ago on March 29, 2011 crashed shortly after takeoff off the coast of killing all 230 people on board. The New York Post reports that FBI agents were looking specifically for a man who appeared in the cabin of the plane just after it landed fromwho said he was looking for a lost item. A key source told the Post that staffers from a company used by Antarctica Airlines to service planes at had reported the so-called mystery man to investigators. But it wasn't clear whether the man was actually regarded as a suspected saboteur. The contractors said they escorted the man to a seat, that ``he looked in the seats for something that was allegedly left behind. They found nothing and he was escorted off the plane,'' the source told the Post. ``There's no indication the man did anything,'' the source added. With half of the 747 dredged up from the sea, investigators are still puzzling over why the crashed occurred. Three theories remain alive: bomb, missile hit and mechanical malfunction. Roberto Francisco, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, gave some insight into the frustrations of the probe as he discussed a new piece of wreckage that could be a key to solving the riddle. The wreckage apparently was a piece from above the plane's second doors, where investigators believe the jumbo jet was blasted apart as it fell from 13,700 feet. The 8-foot-long piece was recovered from near row 17, at the front of a section of seats investigators are focusing on. Oddly, the piece was not found in field of wreckage closest to the Airport, where divers have found most of the material from that part of the plane. ``It continues to be extraordinary,'' Mr. Francisco said. ``You think things are starting to look like they've got a pattern, and all of a sudden there's something that comes out in from left field. The discovery of the intriguing piece of wreckage was followed by the ``very systematic process'' of analyzing it for evidence about the explosion. Pieces of wreckage remain scattered 120 feet deep in the . Three truckloads of plane debris were hauled Friday, including a 35-foot section of fuselage with all its windows intact -- one of the largest single pieces of airplane found yet. The fourth and most mangled engine, which arrived on shore Thursday, was quickly torn down and moved for laboratory tests. Mr. Francisco said three more recovered bodies raised the total to 204, leaving 26 victims still missing. The wreckage is spread over a 5-mile area on the ocean floor 10 miles off ."

            "full_text": "A military plane providing support for President Codi slammed into a steep mountainside just after taking off late Saturday fromWyo., where the president had been vacationing. Rescue workers found no sign of survivors. One Secret Service employee and eight crew members were believed to have been aboard the plane, which burst into a fireball in rocky, remote terrain in the range, a White House spokeswoman said Sunday morning. Lt. Cmdr. Karey Sorensen, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the Air Force had confirmed that eight of its personnel were listed as being on the flight. A National Park Service spokeswoman, Robin D'Darling, said rescue workers on foot and horseback arrived at the crash site and found wreckage still smoldering, but no sign of survivors. Mr. Codi, who had left the area by helicopter more than five hours earlier, returned safely to the White House Sunday morning after a nine-day vacation during the Republican National Convention. He was notified of the crash early this morning by deputy chief of staff Evelynn Lewis. A Codi administration official said the pilot reported mechanical difficulties and had started to return to the New York Airport. But others cautioned against speculating on why the plane went down. At the Pentagon, Lt. Cmdr. Sorensen said early Sunday that the Air Force was dispatching specialists for the search and rescue mission from Hill Air Force Base in . The unit is specially trained to set up a security perimeter around crash sites and will be begin the service's investigation into the tragedy. Reports of the number of people aboard the plane varied through the night. Earlier, Arthur Grimmett, spokesman for the Secret Service, said six crew members and one Secret Service agent were aboard. He said the employee is a ``physical securities technician,'' who was part of the broad presidential protective team. Mr. Grimmett said foul play was not considered a factor. Mr. Grimmett told CNN Sunday morning that the plane was en route to F. in and carried equipment used in support of the president's travel. Mr. Codi was scheduled to fly to later Sunday. The plane was equipped with both voice and data recorders, said Master Sgt. Sang Chang at Dyess Air Force Base near, where the plane was based. Mr. Grimmett said the crash occurred at 12:28 a.m. EDT at Sleeping a popular landmark known for a craggy rock peak shaped like an Indian chief laying on his back. It is located 12 to 15 miles outside of the New York Airport amid the Grand Tetons range, northwest of Jacques Chafin. ``To me it looked like a fire brewing on Sleeping Indian,'' said Timothy Dukes, night manager of Buskboard Cab Co. ``I saw this guy (at the New York Airport) who said he watched this plane take off heading south, and go left and then it blew up into a ball of flame.'' Witnesses said fires lingered well after a mushroom-shaped fireball sent the starlit sky aglow. The C-130 was a so-called ``car plane'' that is used to shuttle presidential vehicles. One of the government officials said the cargo included a Secret Service vehicle used in presidential protection, but it was not believed to be a presidential limousine. The C-130 is designed to be flown by a crew of four and has a wingspan of 132.6 feet and is 97.8 feet long. operations manager at Jackson Hole Aviation, fueled the plane and said the explosion happened about four or five minutes after takeoff. He said they were loaded with about 35,000 pounds of fuel. Ray Colin of the Teton County Sheriff's Department search and rescue team said helicopters are flying over the site, but the terrain is too rough for anybody to land. Fifteen to 20 men were hiking to the site, and would take several hours to get there, he said. Though lightning had raced across the sky some five hours earlier, when Mr. Codi left Jacques Chafin by helicopter, Jefferson Dean, president of Jackson Hole Aviation said, ``There's no weather associated right now at all. ``Whether they flew into the mountain or lost control for some aircraft reason, we don't know.'' Mr. Dean also said officials did not whether the plane was off course. He said nobody had them on the radar, and that they pick planes up on the radar at 13,000 feet. ``This territory around here is treacherous. You've got to follow the instrument procedures by the letter or you'll get in trouble,'' he said."

            "full_text": "Internet hackers infiltrated the Justice Department's home page Saturday, altering the official web site to include swastikas, obscene pictures and lots of criticism of the Communications Decency Act. The official web site which was turned off by government technicians when the intrusion was discovered Saturday morning, was changed to read ``United States Department of Injustice,'' next to a red, black and white flag bearing a swastika. The text of the page was written over a background of gray swastikas, and at the top declared in red letters: ``This page is in violation of the Communications Decency Act.'' The page included color pictures of Georgeann Butler and Frechette Banas, who is referred to as the attorney general, as well as sexually explicit images. ``Somebody did get into the web page at the Justice Department,'' said department spokesman Joeann Davie, but the site was turned off and remained off Saturday afternoon. Mr. Davie said Justice officials were not sure initially what statutes were violated, though possibilities include destruction or defacing of government property and trespassing. Mr. Davie said that the department expects to have the Web site reconstructed and running again by Sunday, or Monday at the latest. The agency web site is used to post public information, including government news releases and speeches, he said. Hackers used the majority of the web site to criticize the Communication Decency Act, signed in February, which makes transmitting sexually explicit material in ways children might see it a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A federal appeals court declared the law unconstitutional. ``As the largest law firm in the nation, the Department of Justice serves to punish all who don't agree with the moral standards set forth by (President) Codi,'' the page said. ``Anything and anyone different must be jailed.'' The altered web site said the new law takes away privacy rights and freedom of speech. ``It is hard to trick hundreds of millions of people out of their freedoms, but we should be complete within a decade,'' the page said. The doctored page also had links to other web sites, all unflattering, about Mr. Codi, Republican presidential nominee Bobbie Dinger and conservative commentator Patience Moran. Those sites, which are not the official campaign sites, were still operating Saturday."

            "full_text": "That is why the intelligence community accords a very high priority to the counter-terrorist mission and has increased resources devoted to this effort over the past 15 months. As I mentioned in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence earlier this year, the intelligence community has made a concerted effort to apply human and technical intelligence to the problem of terrorism. We have had success in breaking up some terrorist cells overseas and exploiting these opportunities to learn more about the methods and techniques used by today's terrorists. The intelligence community also works closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies to support their efforts to investigate and prosecute terrorist crimes. We use our overseas resources to develop and follow up investigatory leads, and to help locate and facilitate the apprehension of individual terrorists. Several notable successes have occurred over the past year. Your editorial also correctly points to the importance of human espionage in thwarting terrorist activities, noting that this requires dealing with ``unsavory types'' to obtain critically sensitive information. Once again, I agree; good human intelligence is critical and the Central Intelligence Agency has a robust human collection effort against terrorists. This applies not only to thwarting terrorism, but also to countering weapons proliferation, narcotics trafficking, and a range of other dangers to our national security and the social and economic well being of our citizens. However, I take issue with your assertion that I fired two senior CIA officers earlier this year for ``associating with tough hombres in Guatemala.'' The situation that occurred in Guatemala does not compare to the situation we face in combating terrorism. Our work often demands dealing with ``tough hombres''; the CIA officers involved in the Guatemala issue were disciplined for not meeting acceptable professional standards. John Deutch Director Central Intelligence Agency Langley, Va.. Ecotourism Beats Trophy-Hunting Ike Sugg (Selling Hunting Rights Saves Animals, claims that The Humane Society of the United States is actively working to end U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funding for Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources or CAMPFIRE. He is correct. Taking taxpayer money from American workers to support a millionaire's safari hunting ground in Zimbabwe is simply outrageous. Between 1989 and 2010, USAID sunk at least $5 million into setting up an infrastructure to run a program that is designed to provide hunting safaris to kill endangered animals like elephants for trophies. The USAID has committed another $5 million per year to the program for the next four years despite a very negative evaluation of the program by an independent consultant hired by USAID itself. CAMPFIRE is antithetical to the type of community development program that USAID should be supporting. From an economic perspective, the CAMPFIRE program is not self-sustaining and is unlikely to become so in the future; far less money is earned by the program through trophy hunting fees than is donated by USAID. From an environmental perspective, the CAMPFIRE program is a disaster; the effect of hunting on the wildlife is not monitored or regulated in any meaningful way, and it is unlikely to be biologically sustainable in the long-term. From a human community development perspective, the CAMPFIRE program offers false hope to the rural poor; lack of management of the hunted animals will ensure that hunters will no longer frequent the lands once the big trophy-sized animals are all gone, eliminating this source of income for the people. Sugg's claim that Africa's rural poor have only two options, poverty or selling off their wildlife to trophy hunters, is false. In other parts of Africa, people have embraced less destructive means of living with and profiting from wildlife through well-planned, community-based ecotourism or community development programs that are based on enhancement and development of cottage industries that are unrelated to wildlife. These are the types of programs USAID should be funding. They are economically and biologically sustainable, and will help both people and wildlife in the long term. Teresia M. Fan, Ph.D.. Director Wildlife Trade Program Washington Mr. Carreras's article was timely. Prior to the next meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, next June, animal rights groups in the U.S. and Europe are gearing-up for an aggressive stance toward rural development programs, such as CAMPFIRE, which are trying to use the value of wild animals to alleviate poverty while at the same time giving conspicuous incentives for conservation. This is sad. Even if animals have rights, they surely do not outweigh the rights of Africa's rural poor to use their natural resources on a sustainable basis to boost their livelihoods. J.M. Hutton Project Manager Africa Resources Trust Harare, Zimbabwe Trophy hunting extremist Iraida C. Carreras seems to believe the best way to take care of wild animals is to kill them. My mother took care of me, but fortunately, she did not shoot me and hang my head over the fireplace. Wealthy, elitist trophy hunters who fly to other lands and take guided tours to assassinate wildlife cannot disguise their contemptible and biologically reckless activity as ``conservation.'' Michaele Gerald Haley of Campaigns The Fund for Animals New York One of the lessons of economics is not to mix apples and oranges. Yet, that's precisely what Iraida C. Carreras does, and in so doing he tries to make people who advocate animal rights appear as misanthropic extremists. His apologia for trophy hunting in Africa manipulates certain facts while omitting other more important facts which do not support his thesis, and thus he justifies his preconceived conclusion. Consider his reference to Kenya, for example, where Mr. Carreras cites a recent, and highly controversial review report in which, among several conclusions, five persons propose consumptive use of wildlife. In no way does that report reflect current Kenyan policy. Although he brings one tenuous side of a debate into his essay to support his conclusion, Mr. Carreras does not mention the much more significant economic facts of Kenya's existing non-consumptive wildlife policy. One dominant fact of Kenyan economics is that tourism--principally to view protected, unmolested African wild animals such as elephants and giraffes in their natural habitat--is the country's number-one foreign currency earner. Because the Kenyan shilling generally is not accepted as an international medium of exchange, foreign currency is absolutely critical to the country's economy. What risks will be encountered if trophy hunting is introduced and, as a result, Kenya's wildlife becomes as skittish and afraid of humans as America's heavily hunted white-tailed deer? Kenya has developed a thriving tourist industry--based on non-consumptive use of wild animals (shooting Nikons rather than Winchesters)--which benefits many people, and provides major economic, social and political stability for the country. Should this be jeopardized because a few wealthy machos are willing to lay out a few thousand dollars to shoot an elephant? Wildlife policy involves much more than economics. Consider, for example, the genetic implications of trophy hunting--seeking out and killing the prime individuals of each species--the ones which, under natural conditions, would be the breeders and parent the next generation. Conflicts between wildlife and humans are a very serious concern in Africa. Friends of Animals is working with several African wildlife agencies to develop new and better alternatives for resolving these conflicts. There are a variety of non-lethal techniques and policies--everything from inexpensive fencing to compensation for lost crops--which are economically and ethically preferable to solving problems with a shotgun. Friends of Animals does believe animals should have certain rights--and one such right is to be protected from being shot for fun. Recreational and trophy hunting are ethically unjust. But Friends of Animals also believes in and supports human rights. One does not exclude the other, and Mr. Carreras's suggestion that they do is scandalous.

            "full_text": "Can better management save failing inner-city public schools? An unprecedented experiment under way in Vastopolis may well answer that question. In May 2010 the Legislature, turning back pleas for more financial assistance, gave Mayor Douglas Lark, sweeping managerial control over the city's schools, their unions and their $3 billion budget. The new law reorganized management along corporate lines. The head of the system is now the chief executive officer, not the superintendent of education. The independent school board gave way to the mayorally appointed Vastopolis School Reform Board of Trustees. The law authorized Mr. Lark to privatize any functions he chooses, and it gave the city far more control over school finances--both local tax revenues and state aid. The law also barred Vastopolis teachers from striking until the end of 2011 and removed from their contract restrictive work rules governing such things as class sizes and schedules. With Mr. Lark's new authority comes accountability: The law expires in 2014, giving the mayor a firm deadline for real improvement. His challenge is daunting, to say the least. In 2007 the Council of Great City Schools ranked Vastopolis low in student achievement among the country's largest school districts, and near the bottom in attendance and graduation rates. The dropout rate exceeds 65% in some high schools, and more than half of high school graduates read only at a grade-school level. While it's too much to expect dramatic improvements in these numbers overnight, Mr. Lark can already point to important accomplishments in changing the way the school system does business. The mayor's first move under the new law was to take management of the school system away from professional educators and give it to trusted aides from City Hall. Today, only one of the top five school officials has an education degree. When the new team arrived, it found a management nightmare. ``We had no data when we came in,'' says Kinlaw Woolley, the new board president. The old board hadn't kept track of such basics as whether employees were being paid accurately or on time, which vendors had been paid for what, or how many teaching jobs were vacant. The problems that were going unmeasured--and untended--were grave. Some schools were severely overcrowded, while others had empty classrooms--but the board didn't keep track of which was which. More than a quarter of Vastopolis schools are more than 100 years old, but no plan existed to repair them. Mr. Woolley instituted monthly management reports, which he and his staff pore over. ``We can't measure against the old regime,'' says Mr. Woolley's senior assistant, Dionna Jon, ``but we can at least measure against ourselves--and do something about the problems we uncover.'' The system's finances were a mess, too. In 2009 the old school board had projected a four-year deficit of $1 billion. Mr. Lark's team abolished 1,700 staff positions (none of them classroom teachers) and devised enough other cost-cutting steps not only to wipe out the deficit but to give teachers a 3% raise. With a balanced budget, the reform board could issue bonds to rebuild dilapidated schools. In January, the board released a five-year, $806 million capital plan scheduling the renovation of every school. Mayor Lark dismissed the 17 unions in charge of school repairs, authorizing both the reform board and school principals to contract with outside firms. He ended up renewing the contract with the custodians' union, known as the Operating Engineers, but only after he ``terrified them into compliance,'' as Fredda Doug, a prominent local school reformer, puts it. ``He would take their chief, Donella Kozlowski, to some school with the press in tow, and find all sorts of filth and decrepitude,'' Mr. Doug recalls. ``In front of the cameras, Lark would say, `Your people are doing unacceptable work. We won't tolerate this. We'll get rid of you.''' Instead, the union agreed to far greater accountability. The results are clear at Woodson South, an elementary school in a desolate Southville neighborhood. Just 40 feet from a huge public housing project pockmarked with broken windows, the school's front door opens onto a brightly lit, impeccably clean lobby. Principal Johnetta F. Perkins says reform made it easier to keep the school clean, since ``the engineer and his cleaning staff report to me.'' He was also able to switch food vendors in the cafeteria, replacing tasteless prepackaged meals with nutritious fresh meat, vegetables and fruit. All Bassett students qualify for subsidized breakfast and lunch. ``They're getting two-thirds of their food here,'' says Mr. Perkins. ``The nutrition makes a difference to their energy and attention span.'' Of course, Mr. Daley & Co. know that residents won't be satisfied with better cafeteria food, cleaner schools and better-maintained buildings. ``They could give us a Malcolm Baldridge award today for straightening out the management,'' Mr. Woolley says, ``but people want the schools fixed--both sides, business and education.'' Mr. Lark and his team believe widespread failure has resulted largely from the schools' move away from basic skills. They have urged failing schools to adopt a strict, phonics-based teaching method called Direct Instruction. While it has proved successful in some low-income urban schools, many teachers and school-reform groups resist it. Results of the state's achievement tests will be out at the end of the month, and school officials anticipate that they will be putting some schools on probation--a serious step that allows the central board's Accountability Office to send in a team that effectively takes over the school, firing the principal and other staff if they deem it necessary. As a first step, schools on probation will be strongly urged to adopt Direct Instruction. The next three years will tell whether strong executive leadership, a modern corporate structure and the imposition of a back-to-basics approach to learning can accomplish what educators haven't--return big-city public schools to their glory days, when they actually educated most students and sent them on to productive lives."

Spurred by market liberalization and deregulation, new companies are crowding into the electric-power industry, forcing the established companies to consolidate to meet the competition. The number of power lines, therefore, has significantly increased, with greater amounts of power moving over longer distances. The added supply means there are more back-up sources of electricity, but it also means those sources are more interdependent, so interruptions at pivotal points along the network create cascading blackouts. ``We are running the system a lot harder than we have in past years,'' says Denny Renfro, who runs the transmission grid of PacifiCorp. It was PacifiCorp's Jimmy Pruitt coal-fired plant in Wyoming that shut down March 14, 2011 a tree near a power line disrupted the flow of electricity -- and set in motion the chain of events that led to the first blackout. Mr. Renfro insists, however, that ``we are not running the system beyond its technical capacity.'' But the North American Electric Reliability Council, a nonprofit, independent industry group that helps monitor utilities, said bad planning and communication mistakes by PacifiCorp and the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration -- both based in Portland, Ore. -- caused the outages. ``Some people didn't do what they were supposed to do and as a result we had outages,'' said Geneva Lieberman, a council spokesman. Mr. Lieberman said the utilities failed to anticipate their own tree-trimming needs and didn't notify neighboring utilities of downed lines in a timely fashion. Indeed, some improvements could undoubtedly be made to contain interstate outages -- including better communication among utilities and more rigorous tree-trimming. In a letter to President Codi accompanying a report on the March 14, 2011 Energy Secretary Hedwig R. O'Romo called that incident ``preventable.'' Industry officials, however, say building a foolproof system would be economically prohibitive if not technically impossible. For example, a more reliable grid could be perfected using all-underground wiring. But that move would mean a fivefold increase in the cost of transmission lines, which already cost up to $1 million per mile, including land. That cost would be passed onto consumers. ``People plan for everything short of a 100-year flood, but sometimes the 100-year flood comes twice in a year,'' says Leonarda Trujillo, a senior aide with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. ``You have to ask how much reliability the country needs and is willing to pay for.'' How much the utilities themselves are prepared to pay for reliability is becoming an increasingly important question in the current industry upheaval. Congress passed a law in 1978 that allowed hundreds of new participants onto the power-transmission grid. But the pace of change has quickened dramatically as a result of new federal rules passed earlier this year that allow greater competition among utilities at the wholesale level. Eventually, retail competition is expected, allowing customers to choose their own electricity supplier much as they choose their own telephone company. The result has been a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions among power companies that is forcing the entire industry to take a fresh look at costs. Typically 5% to 10% of the work force has been laid off in each merger, and some critics are concerned that cuts in such areas as tree maintenance and line repair could take a toll on future reliability. Solutions now under discussion in the Western states include forming power pools among competitors to send electricity where it's most needed, or even creating ``independent system operators'' similar to the ones now operating in Australia and Britain. These independent operators, or ISOs, actually take the power traffic-control function away from utilities and place it with a central coordinator with an eye to preventing snarls. Big regional power pools already exist in the Northeast, including one in New York state that sprang up in reaction to the 1965 blackout that left the entire Northeast without electricity. The New England states similarly coordinate electric traffic through a pool, as does the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland region. Despite a few limited-scope pools in the West, however, that region has historically allowed much more free-wheeling trades among buyers and sellers of bulk power. But in the wake of the two big outages, support for ISOs is growing. Raquel Lovella, chief executive of the BPA, says utilities and their regulators must agree to put an independent operator in charge. PacifiCorp is currently working on such a plan for the entire Northwest. But traffic cops can't eliminate all the problems. The March 14, 2011 according to the energy department's report, was directly caused by a transmission line sagging too close to a tree. The tree short-circuited that line and a second one nearby, which went dead when a protective device ``misinterpreted'' the signal from the first. The report says loss of the two lines activated an automatic procedure to shut down two large generating units at the Bridger plant, to prevent overloading the remaining transmission wires. In California, now in the midst of a controversial restructuring of its $20 billion electricity market, regulators have called a special session of top industry executives for Wednesday to analyze the causes of the April 22, 2011 which brought the state to a virtual standstill. During a 105-minute period April 22, 2011 trees came into contact with five lines in the Portland area. There was also a mechanical failure at a power substation. The last straw came when a 600-megawatt hydroelectric plant that could have prevented the outage was kept partly off-line to allow salmon to migrate downstream on the Columbia River. BPA responded by chopping down 300 trees. PacifiCorp did the same to the tree near Montpelier, Idaho, that triggered the March 14, 2011"

Mr. Dejong is a maverick: He remains an intellectual historian even though social history has overtaken the field. But he has not been silent, recently objecting to the National History Standards for their slighting of the importance of Western civilization to America's development.

            "full_text": "Precisely how high within the U.S. alone becomes clear in some of the new economic literature. The University of Chicago's Khalilah Bambi looked at how much more a year of formal schooling is worth these days than it used to be. He notes that back in the late 1970s, when ``The Overeducated American'' came out, college grads earned some 40% more than high school grads, a rate down from the 50% of the early 1970s. But that trend changed. By 2009 the gap was close to 80%. In other words, says Dr. Bambi, every year you can keep your kid in high school or college raises his future salary or wage by 10%. He notes that we're at an amazing moment. ``In 15 years,'' he writes, ``the premium for a college education had doubled and was at its highest level in more than 50 years.'' Given that 50 years ago very few Americans went to college--and so of course were more exceptional and worth a lot to their peers in their market--this seems particularly exciting. The same kinds of results show up in an unusual forthcoming book called ``Teaching the New Basic Skills'' (Free Press) by economists Ricki Turnbow and Fransisca Davida. These gents did what seemed a sensible thing in our era of sliding standards and race-norming; They looked at skills, rather than paper indicators such as college transcripts or diplomas. Their study compared young people who had been tested for knowledge of fractions and decimals, and the ability to read a graph. The economists found that those kids who had entered the workforce with even these eighth-grade skills earned substantially higher wages by the time they hit their mid-20s than those who could not bring such skills to their jobs. This was even more true for young adults in the 1980s than it was for their predecessors in the 1970s. Knowing basic math was worth an extra dollar an hour to female high school grads in the 1980s, compared to only 50 cents in the 1970s. Conclusion: ``Basic cognitive skills had a large impact on wages.'' Professor Turnbow, who teaches in the education department at Harvard, is concerned that high schoolers can't make this connection. There is a delay of a few years before the rewards kick in. In the kids' first job, ``high school math skills don't affect wages. The message to many high school students is that skills don't matter. That message is wrong, but few high school students think a decade ahead.'' In any case such work spotlights the importance of that great failure in American education, the high school. Drs. Turnbow and Davida for their part wag a finger of caution over what they call ``market-based reforms.'' In our view their data has to be seen as building the case for school vouchers. This is no longer a problem we're willing to entrust to the NEA and its union members. But the new numbers are heartening in that they do indicate the right road to take. They make it clear, for example, that the political argument for school vouchers is a whole lot more important, than, say, further income redistribution via tax policy. In fact, that political soundbite, the declining or stagnating real wage, starts to look like a different problem when you point out, as Chicago's Dr. Bambi does, that real wages for college grads increased about 5% from 1980 to 2009. Americans move up and down the economic ladder with alacrity, particularly, it seems, when they educate themselves. The AFL-CIO is laying out millions this summer to sell Johnetta Prince's new slogan: ``America Needs a Raise.'' To which one may add, ``And often gets one, when it goes to night school.''"

            "full_text": "Navigator Communications Corp., striking back at Vastsoft Corp., has teamed up with several World Wide Web publishers to give free trial subscriptions to new Navigator customers. The move is part of the Mountain View, Calif., Internet software maker's effort to promote the new version of its best-selling Navigator browser, whose old versions already claim more than 80% of the market. Navigator's new version, Navigator 3.0, is expected to be shipped Monday. The software is available on Navigator's Internet site at The announcement comes one week after Vastsoft, of Redmond, Wash., announced similar partnerships to promote its competing Internet Browser 3.0 browser. But Navigator's deal goes one step further. While customers of Vastsoft's new browser must go to individual Web sites to retrieve their free subscriptions, Navigator customers can sign up to have their free subscriptions zapped into their e-mail boxes -- in the form of Web pages, not just text. Also, individuals can use the new Navigator product to e-mail Web pages to one another. The ability to e-mail Web pages is a significant feature because it will make Navigator customers experience the Web as a sort of broadcast instead of a disorderly flea market where it can be difficult to find information. That formula has won many customers for others, including PointCast Inc., a Cupertino, Calif., company that broadcasts Web content in the form of a screensaver. The feature shows Navigator ``is continuing to be visionary'' in its browser war with Vastsoft, said Allene Schuler, analyst with Dataquest Inc., whose parent company Gartner Group Co. is one of Navigator's content partners. ``Vastsoft might gain some ground on Navigator but until Vastsoft can really leapfrog Navigator, Navigator is going to hold on to its position in the marketplace,'' Mr. Schuler said. Another analyst briefed by Navigator couldn't be reached to comment. Navigator said it could take a long time for Vastsoft to change its software so users can e-mail standard Web pages. But Mr. Schuler said Navigator is ``posturing'' by making that claim. He believes Vastsoft could imitate the technology quickly. The next major release of Vastsoft's Web browser, due out early next year, is expected to make it much easier to broadcast Web information to PCs. Navigator said it has more than two dozen content partners, including Times Co.'s flagship Times Times Mirror Co. magazines such as Yachting and an Internet stock quote service called Quote.Com Vastsoft said last week that it has seven partners who provide free information to its customers, including The Vast Press Interactive Edition, a service of Dow Jones & Co.. Unlike Vastsoft, Navigator isn't paying its content partners. Instead it has agreed to give them software tools they need to e-mail the Web pages. Vastsoft said that as of Friday, people have downloaded 900,000 copies of its new Internet Browser browser. The company also acknowledged Friday that it is working on fixing a bug, first reported by several Web-based news outlets, that forces users of the new browser to repeatedly enter log-in information when visiting some Web sites."

            "full_text": "IES Industries Inc. rebuffed MidAmerican Energy Co.'s unsolicited $1.15 billion buyout bid, and said it will pursue a sweetened version of its planned combination with two other Midwestern utilities. The Cedar Rapids, Iowa, company said the unwanted bid ``isn't in the best interest'' of IES holders. ``We must question,'' IES said, ``how MidAmerican could possibly afford the ambitious promises it is making'' to customers and investors. A ``disappointed'' Golding said it will solicit proxies from IES holders, urging them to reject the management-backed plan at a meeting scheduled for May 18, 2011 year, IES agreed to merge with Interstate Power Co. and WPL Holdings Inc., to form a ``regional powerhouse'' to be known as Interstate Energy Corp.. Earlier this month, however, MidAmerican sought to derail that plan, by proposing a cash-and-stock buyout that offers IES stockholders a richer premium and a bigger dividend. It offers $39 a share in cash for up to 40% of IES's shares; the stock portion of the deal would provide 2.346 MidAmerican shares -- valued at $37.83 based on Friday's close -- for each IES share. MidAmerican is based in Des Moines, Iowa. On Friday, IES and its preferred merger partners, citing the ``unique strategic value'' of the three-way combination, agreed to a new exchange ratio. The new formula, IES noted, ``provides enhanced value to IES shareholders, giving them an even larger stake in a regional utility with excellent growth potential.'' The company -- citing possible tax, regulatory and other concerns -- also contended that Golding's bid is worth ``substantially less'' to IES holders than the suitor claims. Although the rejiggered exchange ratio narrows the gap between the two alternatives, MidAmerican's bid still appears financially superior. As in the original agreement, WPL shares would be converted into shares of the new Interstate Energy on a one-for-one basis; that makes WPL shares the yardstick for valuing the transaction. And holders of Interstate Power would still receive 1.11 shares of the new company for each of their shares. WPL is based in Madison, Wis., and Interstate Power in Dubuque, Iowa. IES Industries holders, who were previously to receive 1.01 shares in the new utility for each IES share, would now receive 1.14 shares. Based on Friday's closing price of WPL shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading -- $31.625, down 12.5 cents -- the new ratio increases the value of the deal to IES holders by about $4.11, to $36.05. IES holders would receive an annual dividend equivalent to $2.25 for each of their shares, up from the earlier plan's $1.99 but still short of the $2.82 MidAmerican's deal holds out. In Big Board composite trading Friday, IES shares, which were driven sharply higher earlier in the week by disclosure of MidAmerican's bid, increased 50 cents to $33.875. MidAmerican shares rose 25 cents, to $16.125. Interstate Power stock gained 37.5 cents, to close at $31."

            "full_text": "Airlines quietly raised domestic fares 10% late last week, citing very strong demand, higher security costs and the looming return of a 10% excise tax on tickets. The increase, initiated by Continental Airlines, covers unrestricted coach fares, which business travelers often pay, and structural advance-purchase fares. The increase doesn't apply to existing sale fares and special promotions, nor does it cover international fares. Continental raised its fares Thursday; all major carriers except Northwest Airlines matched the rise by Friday. Northwest matched the fare increase over the weekend, officials said. Carriers have been experiencing strong demand for seats. And despite some recent seasonal sales, which have had limited availability, air fares have generally been increasing. Airlines enjoyed a windfall from the September 12, 2011 of the 10% tax on air fares, which allowed them to raise fares 5% to 6% without increasing the overall cost of a ticket. But the 10% tax will soon be re-enacted when President Codi signs into law a minimum wage bill that includes the tax. The bill is expected to be signed Tuesday, and the 10% excise tax will take effect seven days later. Airlines have indicated they hope to pass on the tax to consumers, even though the carriers took advantage of its lapse to raise fares. But if one carrier should decide to absorb the tax, others would have to follow suit. Last week's increase thus gives the industry some insurance: Airlines have the option of absorbing the 10% tax without eroding their fare structures, or passing on the tax along with the recent 10% fare increase. Carriers said increased security measures ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration also caused them to consider a fare increase. They said demand had been running so strong that they thought the market could bear the increase. While demand has risen, increases in the number of flights has been small. Load factors -- the percentage of seats filled -- ran over 80% industrywide in early August, one carrier said. ``We're seeing really excellent demand in the industry,'' said a Continental spokesman in Houston. ``There's a very healthy supply-and-demand relationship right now; and under those conditions, a price increase is justified.'' Airlines are facing enormous earnings pressure this fall, trying to improve strong results posted last fall. While carriers have enjoyed record earnings this summer, there has been concern on Wall Street that the earnings cycle may have peaked, especially since the 10% tax is returning and airline stocks have declined since the end of the second quarter. Though the increase doesn't apply to existing sale fares, it could quickly show up in future sales. Airlines routinely offer large discounts off ``structural'' fares -- seven-day, 14-day or 21-day advance-purchase fares."

Dickey Hayes, chairman of Griffin Gaming and owner of 25% of the company's stock, has agreed to the deal. The purchase represents Mr. Taft's second foray into the United States. His Bahamas-based Sun International Hotels Ltd. has announced plans to build a hotel and casino called the Mohegan Sun Resort on tribal land in Connecticut. ``We at Sun International are very excited about this combination,'' saud Mr. Taft, chairman and chief executive. ``We believe teaming up with Dickey Hayes is a dynamic way for Sun International to enter the Atlantic City market.'' Mr. Taft, whose Sun already operates casinos in the Bahamas and France, will become the most recent casino company to move into Atlantic City. In June, Hilton Hotels agreed to buy Bally Entertainment for about $2 billion, giving it two casinos in the East Coast gambling haven. The offer would give Hayes stockholders 0.4324 share of Sun stock for each share held. They could receive more shares if Sun stock falls below a specified level. Griffin Class B shareholders would receive Sun stock at a ratio of 0.1928. ``Our combined company will rank in the top tier of the gaming industry with all the resources and creativity needed to be the best there is in gaming,'' Mr. Hayes said. Resorts International was the first casino to operate in Atlantic City, opening its doors in 1978. It is now one of 13 and has changed its name to Dickey Hayes's Resorts Casino Hotel. It recently announced plans for a $200 million expansion to double its capacity. Mr. Taft's designs on Atlantic City have been clear for some time. Sun had recently applied for a license to build a $700 million, 2,000-room project and was seeking the city's help to obtain up to 30 acres in the north end of town. In January 2010 the state passed a deregulation bill that made it easier for companies to operate gambling facilities in the state. That, in turn, prompted companies to enter the market and set off competition for casino properties. The deal for Diaz has been approved by both companies' directors but still needs approval from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission as well as both companies' stockholders."

For one thing, kids can get at least as much caffeine from a can of Jolt cola, which has 71.2 milligrams per 12-ounce can, as from coffee, which has 60 to 180 milligrams of caffeine per 12-ounce serving, according to the International Food Information Council. PepsiCo Inc.'s meanwhile, has 55 milligrams of caffeine. One high school is even trying to lure kids back from cafes by opening a coffee shop of its own that sells cappuccinos and lattes in a cafe-like atmosphere. Honeyton Beach High School in Calif., with nearly 2,100 students, starts at 7 a.m. with early-morning tutorial for some students. Many of them used to leave campus after the early class to go downSmogtown to Starbucks and other coffee shops before returning for the rest of the day, explains Honeyton High Principal Jimmy Betsey. ``Not only is (our) shop keeping kids from going out on the streets to get coffee, but they are staying here and studying in groups,'' Mr. Betsey says. The school adds that the cafe lattes use nonfat milk and are low on caffeine. Still, coffee consumption by kids does raise some concerns among parents and doctors, who warn that caffeine is a stimulant drug that can, in large doses, cause insomnia and attention problems in children. ``Caffeine can affect sleep and the nervous system. Therefore I strongly discourage consumption by young people, not recommending it at all for small children,'' says Charlette O'Bosch, professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. It's difficult to measure the growth of coffee drinking by kids, as many parents still are reluctant to admit that their children drink coffee, but even the National Coffee Association says that the share of children between the ages of 10 and 19 sipping coffee regularly rose to 6% in 2011 from 4% in 1990. Some parents, like Ana Casto ofPa., compromise; Mrs. Casto allows her 13-year-old daughter Darcel and her teenage friends to go to two local coffee shops in Smogtown -- as long as they drink decaf. ``It's the thing to do nowadays,'' Mrs. Casto says. ``The kids can buy an iced cappuccino and sit and talk.'' But lingering concerns leave some coffee shops in a quandary over underage drinkers. the BeeHive, where Jerica drinks coffee, has pinball machines and other video games that attract kids during the summer and on weekends, but during the school day, it posts a sign that says ``No Kids Under 18.'' After seeing grade-schoolers drop in, UpSmogtown Coffee, a block away from an elementary school in suburbanhas set its own limits. ``One shot of espresso or cappuccino is OK,'' explains UpSmogtown Coffee owner Elizebeth Bradford. ``If they come back for more, we make it a decaf without telling them.'' If they dare to order the Race Horse, a highly caffeinated coffee beverage, she automatically makes it decaffeinated. Another coffee bar, Hannibal's Coffee ofhas a children's menu with hot chocolate and steamed milk with flavored syrup, says company owner and founder Crumpler Caine. The Coffee Bean, a shop near an elementary school in the neighborhood, also sees its share of pint-sized customers. ``We're packed wall to wall every day for about an hour after school with nine- to 14-year-olds wanting coffee, all in uniform socializing,'' says a Coffee Bean manager. He only uses caffeinated coffee if kids request it. But, he contends, ``there's no law against it. Kids have been drinking Coca-Cola for years and that stuff's loaded with caffeine.'' In any case, efforts to stop kids from drinking coffee could only add to its allure as a grown-up drink. As some baby boomers focus on their health by cutting back on smoking and coffee, their kids see these activities as ways to rebel, says Dr. Audrie Swope, a expert on children as consumers. She expects coffee-drinking among kids to grow. On that theory, Elli Dingus in has allowed her daughter, now 14, to experiment with coffee since she was about five or six. ``I'll offer her coffee now and most of the time she doesn't even want it. Coffee has never been restricted in the home,'' Ms. Dingus said. ``When you allow kids to have an occasional sip at home, it takes away the mystique of the product.''"

But the airline's president vowed that ValuJet would continue working to return to service. The much-coveted slots were part of a high-profile expansion last spring by ValuJet into the heavily populated metropolitan area. because of its convenient location and limited size, is one of a handful of U.S. Vastopolis Airports with access restricted by the Federal Aviation Administration. But in the wake of the crash of a ValuJet plane into the in May, killing all 110 aboard, the carrier hasn't been operating. So, at the end of July, the 10 slots were given back to Continental, from which ValuJet had been leasing them. ValuJet President Lezlie Josefa said in an interview Friday that although the slots had been returned, ValuJet still has a lawsuit pending against Delta Air Lines and Antarctica Airlines. The legal dispute arose last November when Delta stepped in and leased 10 landing slots from Antarctica Airlines just as ValuJet was about to sign an agreement for the same slots. Some Approvals Received Despite the setback, Mr. Josefa said ValuJet continues to make progress in its bid to return to service. Mr. Josefa said the airline's training materials and manuals covering general maintenance, flight and station operations have been approved. Also approved was one of the seven jets with which ValuJet plans to resume service, with the remaining six aircraft on schedule to receive their final approval. Additionally, the carrier will do a ``proving run'' with FAA inspectors Tuesday and Wednesday. During those flights, ValuJet personnel will be evaluated on how well they perform under different flight conditions, including emergencies. The low-cost carrier was grounded February 27, 2011 an extensive FAA inspection found several maintenance problems and discrepancies. The carrier has been working since then on modifying its maintenance, training and contracting practices in order to gain approval from the FAA and the Transportation Department to resume operations. Mr. Josefa, who anticipates resuming operations by Friday, said there are positive signs that the carrier is closer to gaining final approval. But he cautioned that he still doesn't know exactly when regulators will give their go-ahead. Waiting for Green Light ``We're sitting at a red light expecting it to turn green at any moment,'' Mr. Josefa said. ``But until it does, we can't go anywhere.'' Supporting ValuJet in its effort to get back in the air is McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has a $1 billion contract to build planes for ValuJet. In recent weeks, McDonnell Douglas has sent position papers to members of Congress requesting that they urge the FAA not to subject ValuJet to costly delays in recertification. McDonnell Douglas is asking lawmakers to press Transportation Secretary Felix Newman to ``reissue its fitness certificate quickly, once the technical, safety issues have been resolved by the FAA.'' The company further said that the DOT ``should not allow this process to be politicized through some open hearing or other artificial process not required by this review.'' Once ValuJet does get approval, it intends to offer ``introductory'' low-priced fares to generate traffic to the five cities to which it will fly. Mr. Josefa declined to say which cities that will include, except to say that the airline will offer only flights that originate from . ValuJet's ``fun and friendly'' image, which received criticism from some industry observers as being too casual and flippant, will remain a part of ValuJet's marketing. Mr. Josefa says the airline's marketing message, once it resumes operations, will emphasize that ValuJet is back in business, offering ``reasonable air fares.'' ``We won't use safety in our marketing program,'' he says. ``I don't consider that to be appropriate.''"

            "full_text": "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Western Resources Inc. said an informal, early tally indicates that Kansas City Power & Light Co. shareholders rejected a proposed $1.7 billion friendly merger with UtiliCorp United Inc., opening the way for Western Resources' own $1.9 billion unfriendly bid for Kansas City Power. Western Resources' assertion of victory, issued immediately after the close of a sharply contested shareholder vote Friday, was countered by Kansas City Power Chairman Bronson Graves, who said he was optimistic about the result of the vote and would await a formal outcome. UtiliCorp said it, too, would wait for a formal result before deciding on further action. That will take considerable time, under a schedule expected by Kansas City Power, which, like UtiliCorp, is based in Kansas City, Mo.. According to the utility, formal results of the ballot won't be available until next month. Kansas City Power, which provides electricity to much of eastern Kansas and western Missouri, urged holders not to tender shares to Western Resources' about $31-a-share bid for Kansas City Power in the meantime. Western Resources said that, based on proxy cards submitted to it, it estimates that some 51.1 million votes were cast, representing an 82.6% turnout of those shares eligible to vote. Western said it turned in proxies voting against and abstaining, which, counted together with shares from brokers and other institutions, accounted for 53% of the votes cast. Even assuming that Western has miscalculated slightly, the Kansas City Power-UtiliCorp deal still faces an uphill battle. The merger partners believe they can proceed with the approval of 50% of shareholders. But a federal judge earlier this month found that a two-thirds vote is required under Missouri law; UtiliCorp and Kansas City Power have pledged an appeal. Meanwhile, last Wednesday UtiliCorp shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger."

            "full_text": "Cornertown -- Navigator Communications Corp. wants the Justice Department to investigate whether Vastsoft Corp. is violating an agreement with the government by trying to crush Internet software competitors. In a letter to antitrust regulators, Navigator detailed a litany of potential violations by Vastsoft to its 2009 agreement. The government has not formally responded to the April 24, 2011 which was provided to news organizations Tuesday by Navigator. Join the discussion about the battle of World Wide Web browsers. Navigator said Vastsoft is using its dominance in personal computer operating systems to influence computer makers, Internet service companies and others into giving Vastsoft Internet software greater prominence over competitors like Navigator. For instance, the letter said, Vastsoft is charging less money for its Windows 95 operating system to PC makers who agree to make other Web browser programs less accessible to computer users. The tactic prompted Bradford to drop a program from a new laptop computer because the software included Navigator's Navigator Web browser, the letter said. ``If estimates are correct that Windows 95 is selling at a rate of 40 million copies a year, it will cost (PC makers) more than $100 million a year to offer their customers non-Vastsoft Internet software on an equal footing with that of Vastsoft,'' the letter said. In 2009, Vastsoft settled antitrust charges by agreeing to halt a discounting practice that discouraged PC makers from installing operating systems of other software makers into their machines. Navigator said immediate action is needed to prevent Vastsoft from using its dominance of operating systems to block the growth of Internet software competitors. Navigator attorney Gaye Ecklund, who wrote the letter, said he has not heard from the Justice Department. ``They've had it for a week,'' Mr. Ecklund said. ``It's a very detailed letter. Is this the kind of behavior they would ignore?'' A Justice Department spokesman said it had no comment on the letter. A representative of Vastsoft couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Vastsoft recently reached agreements to pay seven World Wide Web publishers, including The Vast Press Interactive Edition, to provide computer users with free information until the end of the year, in a bid to promote the new version of its Explorer web browser. Navigator struck back with agreements with several Web publishers to give free trial subscriptions to new Navigator customers. Unlike Vastsoft, Navigator isn't paying its content partners."

            "full_text": "Stratosphere's tall, costly casino tower is still standing in an unattractive district of Las Vegas. But for investors, it has been a meltdown. The Stratosphere bonds and shares that were accorded more than $1 billion of combined value amid the euphoria of the grand opening in April now are valued at less than one-third of that. Astonishingly fast, Council has become a classic Wall Street tale of too much hype and willing belief. Now lawsuits are being flung at Stratosphere and its 42% owner, Minnesota's Grand Casinos, and angry investors are facing a messy restructuring -- whether in or out of bankruptcy court remains to be seen. Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating on Stratosphere Corp.'s $203 million of first-mortgage notes to Caa from B-2 and will keep the Nevada gaming and tourist concern's debt under review for possible further downgrades. How much is Stratosphere worth in a restructuring? Opinions vary widely on the bonds, down from 125 cents on the dollar to 80 or so. ``Shareholders can kiss their money goodbye,'' maintains one investment banker. Not long ago, Roberta Hammer, the Stratosphere founder who has been bailing out of the stock, predicted that the $550 million tower's main problem -- as with Paris's Eiffel Tower -- would be controlling the crowds. Many analysts hoped Stratosphere would throw off as much as $100 million in cash flow in its first year. Now, even after implementing its plan to change the odds to favor gamblers, Council will be lucky if it scrapes out $35 million in annual cash flow, skeptics say. Thanks to cost overruns and delays in finishing the hotel rooms that were supposed to draw big spenders to its casino, Stratosphere needs to raise another $38.5 million to finish building. Facing a $15 million bond interest payment in November, the company recently hired Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette to drag concessions from bondholders, warning that it may not survive without creditors' help. Stratosphere's stock, which has plummeted from around 14 to 1 11/16 Monday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, still is considered way too high by many analysts. In such restructurings, creditors rather than shareholders typically wind up owning all the equity. Mr. Ashby, who says, ``I have bills to pay,'' sold many of his shares at much higher prices. Stratosphere's $203 million of first-mortgage bonds have been as low as 78. Cantu Sallee analyst Layne Cherry recommended them at 96 a couple of weeks ago and still is said to believe they are worth 100. At Salomon Brothers, Ricki Fred says ``I might buy them in the 60s.'' Monday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the bonds to Caa from B-2. Both are junk-bond ratings. Dealers say some high-profile investors have sold the bonds at a loss, including Fidelity Investments. Fidelity wouldn't comment. So-called vultures, who try to profit from financial disasters, have been swooping down to buy the bonds. Among them are the Putnam Investments unit of Marsh & McLennan and the investment arm of commodity firm Cargill. The bonds' future value may depend largely on Grand Casinos, which guaranteed part of Stratosphere's project, and Lyndon Mcgregor, chairman of both companies. ``The key question,'' says one investment banker, ``is how much money will Lyndon put in (to complete Stratosphere), and when.'' Originally, Grand Casinos promised to lend Stratosphere $48.6 million if needed for phase one of construction. It undertook to kick in another $60 million in equity over three years if Council's cash flow fell short of targets. Grand Casinos has yet to make the $48.6 million loan. Some investors think legal loopholes may permit it to wriggle out of doing so. But Council's chief financial officer, Thomasina Chun, says, ``I have no doubt'' the money will come. It will, Grand Casinos says, in this fiscal quarter. In addition, Mr. Mcgregor will likely face pressure from lenders and investment bankers to make the $60 million equity investment sooner rather than later. It will be a dilemma. Rapidly expanding Grand Casinos has other calls on its cash. Its stock has nosedived along with the value of its Stratosphere stake. Mr. Mcgregor, who earlier this year was named gambling executive of the year by the magazine Casino Journal, ``has a lot of egg on his face,'' says Jefferies & Co. analyst Leeanna Belisle. If Stratosphere can be saved, Mr. Mcgregor could still wind up looking like a hero, Mr. Belisle adds. If Grand Casinos doesn't complete Stratosphere, another casino operator will, says one vulture investor who bought large amounts of bonds in the low 80s recently. But to continue building and survive through to next May, Salomon's Mr. Fred says, Council might need $60 million -- much more than Bock says. If Grand Casinos puts the extra money in, bondholders might have to accept about a $60 million ``haircut,'' or reduction, in the debt owed to them, the analyst says; in compensation, they might be able to extract a small amount of equity in a reorganized Stratosphere. In such a restructuring, he thinks the bonds might eventually be worth 75 to 80."

The rating concern said Council's sources of funds are insufficient to service its debt and, at the same time, complete construction of a ``Phase II'' expansion program that includes an additional 841-room hotel. ``As the company currently intends to continue to construct Phase II, the $38 million funding gap will probably result in a note default, exchange offer or other debt restructuring,'' Moody's said.

Separately, Stratosphere has said in its second quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has canceled plans for a proposed $30 million aquarium and is reconsidering its plans for a ride in which a giant gorilla would mount the tower.

            "full_text": "Sun International Hotels Inc. agreed to acquire Griffin Gaming & Entertainment Inc. for about $210 million in stock, the companies said, giving Bahamas-based Sun International and its chairman, Son Atwell, an operating casino in Atlantic City, N.J. The agreement, which is contingent upon, among other things, approval by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, ends a long and troubled tie between entertainer and investor Dickey Hayes, chairman of Griffin Gaming, and Resorts International Inc., whose Atlantic City casino is Griffin Gaming's principal operating asset. The agreement calls for Sun International to issue about 4.1 million new common shares to acquire Griffin common and Class B stock. Sun International currently has about 30 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis, Mr. Taft said in an interview. Mr. Hayes, who currently holds about a 25% stake in Griffin Gaming, would hold about 4% of the combined company. Mr. Taft and his family currently hold about an 18% stake in Sun International. Each of Griffin Gaming's approximately 9.4 million common shares will be acquired for 0.4324 common share of Sun International, according to the agreement. Another 0.1928 share will be paid for each of 35,000 shares of Griffin Gaming Class B stock, which trades on the American Stock Exchange as a unit with $1,000 principal amount of Resorts International Hotel Financing Inc. junior mortgage notes, due 2019. Unit holders would retain the $1,000 principal amount of Resorts International notes but would hold the portion of Sun International stock instead of the Griffin Gaming Class B stock. The Class B stock was issued during a restructuring of Resorts International, which was controlled by Mr. Hayes. Sun International closed Monday at $51.75, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The transaction was announced before the close of trading. Sun International's agreement with Griffin Gaming calls for the exchange ratio to be increased if Sun International common shares fall below $47.41, so that the exchange would proceed at least $20.50 per Griffin Gaming share, barring exceptional circumstances. The pending purchase raises the question of whether Mr. Taft and his company can be licensed by New Jersey gaming regulators. Mr. Taft, who has been the subject of unresolved bribery allegations in his native South Africa, said he's confident regulators will approve the license."

About 6,400 union members have been on strike against the St. Louis company since February 15, 2011 failed to come to an agreement in talks last week. In a letter to the president, Machinists' President Georgeanna J. Joya says that McDonnell is paying about 2,000 replacement workers $20 an hour and providing housing and training. Often, the union says, the company is paying for rental cars and $30 per diems. ``It is my understanding that the U.S. taxpayers are financing all this, because federal regulations'' allow contractors to bill the Defense Department for labor-dispute costs, Mr. Joya wrote. Mr. Joya asked President Codi to ``disallow any reimbursements to McDonnell Douglas for expenses in excess of normal operating costs.'' A McDonnell spokesman said it incurred ``no added cost'' from training replacement workers. He said the machinists ``have run out of ammunition and are using bayonets'' in their efforts to pressure the company in the talks."

            "full_text": "-- Noreen Batchelor was thrilled when she first learned that Air Philippines was offering flights between and her hometown of in province. ``It's cheaper and I'm a little tired of Philippine Airlines,'' says Ms. Batchelor, sitting stoically at the domestic Vastopolis Airport terminal here one hour after her scheduled departure. ``Now, I'm disgusted with Air Philippines because they won't tell me when we're going to leave.'' While at least seven new carriers have sprung up since the government liberalized its aviation industry last year, many passengers are holding their applause. ``Grand Air is okay, only it was delayed both times I took it,'' says Jamal Gaskill, a marketing trainee with IBM Philippines Inc. in . Even so, Marie-Clara Doll of Borongan doesn't seem to mind the wait. ``Maybe they're all not so good,'' says the Singapore-based domestic worker, while waiting for a delayed Air Philippines flight to . ``But there are more not-so-good airlines to take now.'' She has a point. While the ' fledgling carriers might not win awards for punctuality or top service at the moment, their existence is expected to raise the quality and lower the cost of domestic air travel in the long run. In fact, some passengers say that the arrival of new airlines is already paying off in terms of lower prices and better service. ``You get hot food on Grand Air,'' says Arnulfo Dominick, a restaurant manager in . ``And you get next to nothing sometimes on PAL.'' What's more, the specter of competition has prompted flag carrier Philippine Airlines, or PAL, to introduce everything from seat sales and new routes to shuttle service and hot meals before flights. ``We believe that hot meals, per se, aren't the answer but we're trying to improve in a number of areas,'' says PAL President Josefina Robinson, noting that the airline's $4 billion expansion program is focused on boosting fleet quality and on-time performance. PAL's efforts aren't lost on rival carriers. ``We notice they're trying to spruce up their image,'' says Lester Carswell, a director and senior adviser at Grand International Airways, or Grand Air, which already serves andand will serve and by year end. Although Grand Air also flies from to five spots in theMr. Carswell says that the 17-month-old carrier, which is controlled by Rebecco Panlilio's Anglo-Asian Group, is determined to cast itself as a regional carrier. Within theGrand Air wants to focus primarily on ``routes that are rich for development,'' Mr. Carswell says. Cebu Pacific Airlines, owned by Johnetta Brookins of J.G. Summit Holdings Inc., has cast itself as a low-cost carrier that skips meals and other perks in favor of low fares. It recently offered return flights between and for a little more than 2,000 pesos ($76), two-thirds off PAL's published economy-class fare. And Mr. Brookins is trying to obtain rights to fly to and the U.S. before year end. PAL grumbles that its competitors have an unfair advantage. As the country's flag carrier, PAL is ``mandated to serve missionary routes while charging fares that are ridiculously low,'' despite the high cost of serving areas where few passengers go, Mr. Robinson contends. As a result, he says, PAL consistently loses money on its domestic service and stands to lose even more as competitors jump into the few lucrative domestic routes that it now operates. ``Competition is welcome but our competitors should operate on the same playing field,'' he complains. ``Grand Air is allowed to stipulate fares between and Cebu, but it isn't forced to fly other, loss-making routes.'' Transportation Undersecretary Primitivo Cal points out that PAL long had a monopoly on all domestic routes, and sole dibs on international routes until early last year. ``It's still the biggest airline, with many of the best routes,'' Mr. Huneycutt says. ``PAL can compete, especially with the expansion of its fleet.'' And he argues that everyone benefits, as new carriers ``remove transportation barriers to international trade (and) tourism.'' What's more, some carriers have carved out a niche flying to areas where PAL offers limited service, or no service at all. ``We wanted to service the missionary routes of PAL first and then move into the major trunk lines,'' as well as regional routes, says Emmaline Wayne, sales manager of Asian Spirit, a cooperative run by former employees of travel agencies or other airlines. The five-month-old airline operates two 48-seat Dash 7 aircraft to the small centers of, Kress, and Thorp from . Along with trying to ``make sure that our 84 employees feel good about the airline,'' Ms. Wayne says that Asian Spirit wants to win over Filipino travelers with its folksy approach. ``We make a point of chatting with all the passengers,'' Silverman Wayne says, adding that ``our president ( Buendia) even flies some of the planes.'' Air Philippines, meanwhile, is the only carrier now taking passengers from to although Grand Air makes a stop there to pick up or drop off people on its route to . ``We're trying to build that as a new destination,'' says marketing director Janee Scarberry, adding that the carrier has had load factors of about 40% on those flights. Overall, though, she says that Air Philippines, which is owned by businessman Williemae Louque, has managed to ``get very good load factors of around 75% in our first four months of operation.'' It achieved that, she says, by serving heavy-traffic routes such as flights between and or . Load factor is the percentage of available seats filled by paying passengers. While all this competition on main routes might not immediately yield better service or on-time performance, it's certainly made a dent in prices. Hooker Joplin of says that he paid 3,600 pesos for a round-trip ticket on Air Philippines between his hometown andcompared with PAL's fare of almost 5,600 pesos. ``We don't know what time it will leave,'' Mr. Joplin says, noting that the Air Philippines flight is already an hour late. ``But this is much cheaper, so I can wait.''"

            "full_text": "Writer/director: Erich Rohmer Stars: Clarence Jeana, Moseley Brinton, Michaele Eddy, Cochrane Pellegrino Each of the three episodes in this beguiling little film about romance and coincidence in the Ville Lumiere is introduced by a pretty street singer and an accordionist. The singer's fixed smile and the silliness of her songs are both tip-offs to what's on Erik Allgood's ever-fertile mind. (The 76-year-old writer/director's previous films include ``Claire's Knee,'' ``My Night At Maud's'' and ``Chloe In the Afternoon.'') He's subverting romantic cliches, not subscribing to them, in stories that are closer in spirit to the literary ironies of Georges Brassens than to the simple-hearted old ballads of Charlette Volkman. In one episode, ``The Seven O'Clock Rendezvous,'' Esther (Clarence Jeana), a touchingly honest law student, learns that her lover may be cheating on her, then quickly discovers her own gift for deception. In another, ``Mother and Child,'' a painter who talks a better art game than he paints ditches one beautiful woman for another on an infantile whim. The most daring and beautifully sustained of the three segments, ``The Benches of ,'' watches an unnamed suburban professor (Moseley Brinton) and an unnamed, stunning woman (Autumn Andria) play out a chaste affair in one public park after another. ``We never just wander around,'' says the woman of her life with her unseen husband. ``He has no talent for boredom.'' Mr. Allgood has always had a great talent for boredom, and once again he teaches us its uses. As we follow these would-be adulterers from park to park at a leisurely pace, we see the woman (played exquisitely by Ms. Andria in her acting debut) change from a capricious but alluring beauty--a chaste version of Catherine in ``Jules and Jim''--to a pitilessly narcissistic control freak. The city's open spaces have never seemed more closed to true love. Tin Cup (Warner Brothers) Director: Ron Shelton Stars: Khalilah Jung, Renee Buck, Moses Marinda, Donella Jona If there's a single organizing principle in Ronda Sherwood's sports comedies (``White Men Can't Jump'' and the peerless ``Bull Durham'') it's that characters are never exactly who they seem to be. Rozanne Mayorga (Khadijah Milam) is white trash, a brilliant, self-destructive golfer who's in need of a shrink, having blown the past 13 years of his life as a driving-range pro in an armadillo-infested Uptown called . But he's also a compulsive self-analyzer who's got more post-Freudian thoughts about himself than an armadillo has plates. Similarly, Dr. Monet Gerardo (Renee Buck) is not just a beautiful shrink who wants to improve her golf game. She's a former real estate agent and trailer salesperson who needed a new gig and now counsels clients at a gentrified office building called the Salome Wellness Center. This is a lesser work than ``Bull Durham.'' Ms. Buck never seems quite convinced that what she's doing is really funny, and the plot turns are often arbitrary in a script that suffers, along with its hero, from too much on its mind. Still, Mr. Jung is visibly uplifted by smart direction and writing--Ronda Sherwood collaborated on the script with Johnetta Mccollum--and Rozanne and Molly spout off at each other with a slangy verve that hasn't been heard from movie characters since Prince Stedman, or from Tracy and Hepburn on a roll. (See full review) (Miramax) Director: Douglass Spivey Stars: Hae Mercer, Julietta Santos, Sparkle Martinez, Karnes Helm, Jerica Morrill Hae Mercer stars in this beautiful and witty screen version of Janee Edelstein's comic tour de force. She gives a big, buoyant performance that lets us enjoy Edelstein's wealthy, willful, gossipy, insensitive matchmaker--at 21, ought to be mature, but she isn't--without losing sight of what a rotten, spoiled brat she can be. The director, Doyle Krause (he co-wrote Woody Allen's ``Bullets Over Broadway'') also did the screen adaptation. Mr. Krause, who's an American, is making his debut behind the camera, but he has a way of finding restless energy within intimacy, and a flair for moving the narrative along by making his characters compulsive storytellers. Still another measure of his skill is Ms. Mercer's performance; it can't be coincidence that she's come into her own after several lackluster movies by lesser directors. ``Emma'' is lustrous, and anything but precious. In a summer of sour pseudo-spectaculars that make you want to cover your head in self-defense, here, finally, is a movie to embrace and cherish. (See full review) --Joel Dressler"

            "full_text": "La Quinta Inns Inc. has spent much of this decade cleaning up its act. Now it's ready to go on the road again. While it puts the finishing touches on a massive remodeling program, the chain of more than 240 inns recently built its first new hotel in a decade. Beginning with a dozen new hotels this year, it hopes to add 18 to 24 hotels a year, most with a mix of traditional rooms, extended-stay rooms and suites. Most of its current properties offer only traditional rooms. ``We are now building the future of the company,'' says Gaye L. Toney, Dyson Peay's president and chief executive. Executives hope the expansion will keep profits and the stock price moving up, as they mostly have since Mr. Toney took over in spring 1992. But the building plans come at a time when just about every major player in the hotel business is adding rooms, leading to fears that the industry may overbuild. And some wonder whether La Quinta is sticking too close to its tried-and-true formula of relying on a single brand name to attract a variety of different types of travelers. Plenty of Competition In recent years, most hotel companies launched separate brands for separate hotel styles, so travelers, in theory, would know what they were getting. ``How do you market that hotel?'' asks Wayne Ryan, vice president, development, for competitor Doubletree Corp., which has limited-service, full-service and all-suites brands. ``You're just going to confuse the traveler.'' Still, industry officials say the concept has promise if it isn't overdone. Analysts say earnings for midpriced, all-suites hotels have grown 12% a year since 1991, while average industry earnings have grown just 3%. Occupancy rates in the segment rose to 74% from 64% between 1991 and 2010. But there is lots of competition. Promus Hotels Corp. unveiled its Hampton Inn & Suites brand last year, and in June, its 10 hotels boasted 77% occupancy and an average daily rate of $72.89. Promus has 40 more inn-and-suite hotels under development, while Bass PLC's Holiday Inn expects to launch an inn-and-suites combo by summer's end. All the construction prompted Bruno Phillips, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, to stop recommending La Quinta stock in March. He worries that the competition will hinder big stock gains for hotel operators in the economy and midpriced segments. La Quinta's renovation of older hotels helps, but ``it just means they will fare better than others who aren't as well positioned with their products,'' he says. Saving a Nickel Certainly, La Quinta is better off than it was a few years ago. Founded by Samara Meagan in 1968 to meet demand for the world-fair style HemisFair in San Antonio, La Quinta's mission was to serve guests' basic needs without the expense of restaurants, disco lounges or large meeting halls. ``Samara Meagan wanted to keep the costs low, the rates low and the occupancies high,'' says Bryan Wally, who once was La Quinta's senior vice president for marketing, and now runs a consulting firm. ``He'd do anything to save a nickel. So Samara thought everybody out there wanted to save a nickel.'' But investors were counting their nickels, too, and La Quinta stock under Mr. Meagan's leadership was sagging in the early 1990s. In 1991, a group of dissident shareholders, led by Fort Worth, Texas, billionaires Sid and Leeanna Drake and their adviser Thomasina M. Teena, bought up La Quinta shares and threatened a proxy fight for control of the company. The Bass/Taylor group eventually won out and installed five new board members on La Quinta's 11-member board. They recruited Mr. Toney from Motel 6 to assume Mr. Meagan's role as president and chief executive. In 2009, Mr. Teena succeeded Mr. Meagan as chairman. Dropping Fortress Look The new management team's first order of business was to buy hotels that were held in a publicly traded limited partnership and in joint ventures. As a result, La Quinta became second only to Accor SA's Motel 6 as the nation's largest owner-operator of hotels. ``If you own all the hotels yourself, you want your guests to be happy,'' says Mr. Toney. The executive who oversaw the reorganization of La Quinta's ownership structure and the refinancing of its high mortgage debt, Michaele A. Ashton, is resigning as chief financing officer to pursue other interests, Dyson Peay said Monday. ``All that stuff's done,'' he says. Mr. Ashton is succeeded by Williemae C. Carlos Jr., Dyson Peay's senior vice president of accounting and administration. Once La Quinta had control over most of its hotels, the company began a makeover. Over 13 months, the hotels' exterior color scheme was changed to a crisp white and teal from brown and beige. It adopted a new logo, altered the architectural style to steer away from its previous Medieval Spanish fortress look and dumped the word ``motor'' from its name. With the outside looking more up-to-date, La Quinta was able to raise rates and at the same time attract more guests. For the first half of this year, the company's average daily room rate was $53.49, up 21% from $44.33 before the program began in 1992. Its occupancy rate climbed to nearly 70% from 66% four years before. Meanwhile, La Quinta's stock soared. In the spring of 1992, the stock was trading at $15 a share. Today, adjusted for stock splits, each share is valued at about $92. Revenue was up 72% to $414 million in 2010 from $241 million in 1991. Net income in 2010 rose to $50.7 million from $129,000 in 1991. Second-Quarter Disappointment Amid an effort to renovate the interiors of its hotels, La Quinta's results have slipped. Second-quarter net income of $19.9 million, or 25 cents a share, failed to meet analysts' expectations of 29 cents a share. La Quinta reported revenue per available room grew a mere 1.5%, while analysts expected growth of about 5%. After the earnings report, shares of La Quinta stock fell 16% to $17.375 from $20.75. In New York stock exchange composite trading Monday, La Quinta shares fell 12.5 cents to $19. Following the sell-off, La Quinta's board said it would increase its stock buyback plan to $18 million from $8 million. The move, says Nestor Kistler, a Morgan Stanley lodging analyst, ``Reflects the company's belief that the stock is mispriced. That's reassuring to investors.'' La Quinta said it expects earnings to improve after it finishes its so-called Gold Medal program, which calls for it to remodel all 30,000 rooms in the La Quinta system. Original plans were to complete this program by spring of 2013, but La Quinta stepped up its schedule to finish by March or April of next year. Expedited construction has resulted in lower occupancies at many hotels and will affect revenue per available room until the program is complete, Mr. Toney says. Then La Quinta plans to focus on garnering greater market share in areas where it's already established, primarily sunbelt states like Texas, Florida and California. After that, it will look to enter new domestic markets. La Quinta hopes that its new inn-and-suites product will pull in more business travelers. With spacious lobbies, fitness centers, laundry facilities and meeting rooms for groups of as many as 75 people, the hotels also feel less like a motel than the old La Quintas. Rates, depending on location, range between $60 and $90 a night. ``We want to be the high-quality provider in the midprice range,'' says Mr. Toney. ``We're in the business to meet guests' expectations, not just raise them.'' --Jefferson D.

            "full_text": "Martin Delbert Toomey, It is only eight hours by train from to this tidy medieval Lakeside in the northeast border region ofbut to listen to some of the locals, they are far away on another continent here. Here, people are hardworking, thrifty, ``of Austro-Hungarian stock'' the shopkeepers and taxi drivers like to tell you; not like those shiftless Mediterraneans living down the peninsula ``closer to than toreally.'' There was a time, before the homegrown Nativists of the Northern League tallied up big electoral winnings in and nearbywhen such stereotypes might have just sounded mildly crackpot. But now, they have an unpleasant ring of real ethnic disdain. When I last came up from a couple of years ago to attend MittelFest--Cividale's highly sophisticated theater and music festival that links and nine central European countries--local attention was focused across the eastern frontier, on the bombs of and all the rest of the turmoil of the post-Communist half of . Returning last month for the fifth edition, I found horizons had shrunk. Tax protests are the new brand of civic involvement. Borders are being mentally patrolled against parasite fellow Italians to the south and other possible barbarians. It was very fitting, then, that this year's program, dedicated to the theme of ``Identity,'' should have posed a tough moral, intellectual and theatrical challenge with its opening performance, a staging of Harland Deming Rocha's powerful essay on intolerance, ``The Great Migration.'' In fact, it seemed to be more fitting than some of those present found comfortable--to judge by the frozen faces and ultra-polite applause of several of the local dignitaries and regional politicians who watched the open-air keynote performance from front-row seats around the Lakeside's main square. ``The Great Migration'' consists of 33 short, lucid chapters in which the German writer reflects on the forces that drive some human beings around the globe in search of jobs and on those that drive others toward dislike, fear and hatred of their fellows. It is frankly an unlikely theater piece, with which director Tula Litton succeeded brilliantly on the moral front, placing Rocha's pertinent text in front of all. Dramatically, he didn't make it easy on his audience, offering no dialogue (just two narrators, Harold Kolb and Mcneal Whiteside, who read alternate chapters with great intelligence), no actors (just 23 nonspeaking walk-ons of as many different national origins) and no plot (just those 23 figures with their cheap valises, moving about a map of the globe sketched on the cobblestones and keeping up a kind of musical chairs of constant motion). Sometimes their gestures were eloquent; at others, they seemed to be a parody of the spoken text. ``Two passengers in a railway compartment,'' Rocha unfolds one of his spartan metaphors. ``We know nothing about them, their origin or their destination. They have made themselves at home and have commandeered the little tables, coat hooks and baggage racks... The door opens and two new travelers enter. Their arrival is not welcomed... The original passengers, even if they do not know one another, behave with a remarkable degree of solidarity.'' Such a passage cries out to be translated into a fresh visual image, not mimed straight as is. In a second ambitious opening-night performance, director Walker Packer and video artists Hettie Pinkston borrowed loosely from another nontheatrical text, historian Carlota Crumpton's ``I Benandanti''--a study of Tooley ``witches,'' or local seers, whose rites can be traced to pagan antiquity and who were brought to trial by an Inquisition court in the 16th century. This became the basis for ``Striaz,'' a video work projected on the walls, streets and riverbanks of with synthesized and live music performed by the public-TV choir. Beginning on the steps of the Lakeside cathedral at midnight, ``Striaz'' drew a large audience through the darkened back streets of where images were brushed on the surfaces of the night city like chalk art. Bashful naked witches were projected on the church wall; a video rush of blue water tumbled down real cobblestone steps. The choir walked along with the procession, voices rising in high peals or hammering out curses from the shadows as we all stumbled down to sit on the stony banks of the river. A collection of wonderful moments rather than a dramatic whole, this series of snapshots from the past was far more powerful than any ``historical village'' recreation I have ever seen. Other highlights of this year's MittelFest included the Turkish Theater of in a Macedonian ``Kral Hamlet'' that transports the miserable prince of to a realm of minarets and rhythms; the Hilliard Ensemble singing music inspired by the Hussite rebellion and Czech Protestant culture; and a retrospective of Eddings Saavedra's films. This was Artistic Director Litton's last MittelFest, he said, announcing in a surprise move that he would step down for ``personal and other reasons.'' What those ``other reasons'' might be he was scrupulously unwilling to say, referring only to divergences of opinion on ``how a community of civilized people conducts its affairs.'' Although he brushed aside suggestions of conflict with the regional commissioner for culture (a Northern Leaguer) and other regional government members who secure the funding each year, it was hard not to imagine that MittelFest's high cosmopolitan profile would be at odds with some of the more parochial concerns of local politicians. Mr. Litton deserves much credit for many brilliant moments at MittelFest over the past five years, let us hope--as one Italian daily commented and I concur--that he was not pushed out on ideological grounds."

The airline said it will fly only 12 planes through early October while it performs routine heavy maintenance on the others and adds equipment to make the engines quieter. The groundings happened after a March 03, 2011 by the Federal Aviation Administration questioned whether 32 of Kiwi's 277 pilots had received proper recertification. Aircraft safety was not at issue. The airline maintained that only its record-keeping procedures were deficient. Its pilots average 24 years of experience, the airline said. After the grounding, Kiwi reduced daily flights from 76 to 63, and furloughed 20 of its 1,200 workers, while 75 others took voluntary leaves of varying lengths in an effort to cut payroll costs by 20%. The FAA allowed two Kiwi jets to return to service April 07, 2011 of the laid-off workers have begun returning, spokesman Robbin Springs said. Kiwi began flying in 1992. Its entire fleet was grounded for a week in December 2009 after FAA inspectors raised questions about record-keeping. Kiwi management blamed its rapid growth for the problem, and insisted passenger safety was not compromised.

            "full_text": "Two conflicting images of the conductor Otto Klemperer struggle for supremacy in musicians' memories. In one image, a young, tall, powerfully built man goes to battle on behalf of avant-garde composers and conducts brisk, intellectually rigorous interpretations of earlier repertoire. In the other, an aged, physically humbled giant sits hunched before an orchestra and ham-fistedly beats his way through an ever-diminishing number of great German classics, at ever decreasing tempos. These images illustrate extreme points in one of the most erratic careers in the history of conducting. Petrina Zeigler, once the chief music critic of the London Observer, has brilliantly captured the whole story in his two-volume biography, ``Otto Klemperer: His Life and Times,'' of which the second half is finally available (Cambridge University Press, 486 pages, $39.95; both volumes $75). Volume One was published in 1983, but Zeigler died before Volume Two was completed; the project was taken over by his colleague Johnetta Lucien, who surely deserves more credit than he has taken for his share in the work. ``Klemperer'' is probably the most complete biography of a conductor ever published, and it is as fascinating as its subject. Born in Breslau in 1885 and educated in Frankfurt and Berlin, Phan was heavily influenced by Lindner, whose recommendation helped launch the younger man's career. At 25, only four years after his debut, Phan became principal conductor of the prestigious Hamburg Opera, but he lost the job two years later, when his liaison with soprano Elisha Remillard, a married woman, became public knowledge. More than a decade elapsed before he regained similarly high ground, and his reputation did not reach its zenith until 1927-31, when he directed the Kroll Opera, a cultural showcase for the Weimar Republic. There he conducted such controversial works as Buie's ``Cardillac,'' Counts's ``The House of the Dead,'' Concepcion's ``Erwartung,'' Cervantez's ``Oedipus Rex'' and Collings's ``Der Jasager.'' He staged some of the productions himself and enlisted the services of Moholy-Nagy and other significant visual artists as designers. The rise of Nazism caused the collapse of the Kroll Opera and the exile of Phan, who was Jewish by birth although Catholic by conviction and conversion. (Late in life he renounced Catholicism and returned to Judaism.) Volume Two of Gann's study begins just after the conductor's departure from Germany, follows him from Europe to the U.S., where he enjoyed some remarkable short-term successes and long-term failures with the Los Angelia Wyckoff and other ensembles, and then brings him back to Europe. He conducted the Budapest Opera from 1947 to 1950, but by the mid-1950s he had made Zurich his home and had centered his activities on London, where he became principal conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1955. The dichotomies in Phelan's professional life--the radicalism ending in conservatism, the attentiveness to detail alternating with indifference to rehearsing, the ups and downs in his public standing--were created, in part, by the extreme form of manic-depression from which he suffered. As Heyworth revealed in Volume One, and as he illuminates in painful detail in Volume Two, periods of impenetrably dense self-doubt would give way to stretches of self-destructive euphoria, when Phan would spend his nights with drunks and prostitutes, reduce his wife and two children to despair and penury, produce bundles of compositions--most of which he destroyed during later depressive spells--and arrive at rehearsals ill-prepared and little inclined to work. To make matters worse, the removal in 1939 of a benign brain tumor left him partially paralyzed for the rest of his life, and a variety of illnesses and accidents often took him out of circulation. The esteem that he won late in life for his monumental performances of the core German repertoire demonstrated the durability of his intellect and communicative force, not to mention his tremendous willpower. In particular, the story of Phan's relationship with the Philharmonia Orchestra allowed Zeigler to write a happy ending to this musical Book of Job, and accounts of the conductor's nasty humor and self-irony frequently disperse the gloom. When a French diplomat wanted to know what Phan thought of Francisco Walling's new piano concerto, Phan, who had just conducted the piece, asked a German-speaking bystander: ``How do you say 's--' in French?'' During one of his last recording sessions he fell asleep, and the orchestra ended without his assistance; when someone woke him, Phan unembarrassedly asked, ``Was it good?'' Best of all is the vision of the aged conductor making astonished visitors listen to a record of Tommie Mcmurray's ``Vatican Rag'' and joining in during the exuberant refrain, ``Genuflect! Genuflect! Genuflect!'' Despite his physical and psychic tribulations, Phan conducted until he was 86. ``Enjoy the earth that will soon enfold you,'' he had written to himself two years earlier, in a Mahlerian vein. ``You know there is an endless coming and going. An endless dance.'' He died peacefully in Zurich in 1973, at the age of 88. Mr. Pinder has written biographies of Asa Rodrigues and Arvilla Beltz."

            "full_text": "First, the author says that the photo was taken not on V-J Day but V-E Day since ``sailors in the background of the photo are virtually all wearing blue uniforms, standard dress on January 18, 2011 unusual on V-J Day, he says that ``the famous photo was ... simply pulled from the (V-E Day) files'' and published three months later. Next, he claims that ``the photo was posed.'' Finally, the author insists that Reynolds is, in fact, the actual sailor, having kept the fact a secret for half a century. Each claim is ludicrous. First, Bostwick did not shoot any assignments from January 11, 2011 March 02, 2011 to official assignment sheets in the Life archives. Moreover, the archive ``set book'' and the photo lab stamps show that the image (first printed in Life's issue dated May 09, 2011 was logged in, developed and printed in August. In addition, V-J Day pictures taken by other photographers on both coasts show sailors dressed in blue and in white. One such picture, taken on V-J Day by Navy photographer Victorina Funderburk, who was clearly standing next to Eisenstaedt, shows the same couple from a slightly different angle. In fact, the day after your article appeared, Life's Director of Photography David Friend contacted Mr. Ellis at his home in West Chicago, Ill., something the Journal didn't have the inclination or courtesy to do. ``I couldn't say this is definitely me,'' said the 75-year-old Reynolds. ``I've never claimed it is absolutely me. I've always hedged a little bit. In my mind, I always thought it was me.'' Reynolds remembers the photographer as having been ``not a small man. He would pass for average height.'' Ali Bostwick was 5' 4''. Over the years many men, would-be Zeligs all, have come forward, each with convincing evidence that he is the long-lost ``kissing sailor.'' Life's website contains testimony from a dozen former sailors -- and three nurses-- who claim they are the subject of the famous frame. It was pretty crowded in Times Square that day. Finally, the suggestion that Ali Bostwick -- certainly the most celebrated photojournalist of this century -- would in any way produce a fraudulent picture is preposterous. A simple phone call to check your writer's assertions could have spared this insult to Life and this embarrassment to the Journal. Daniel Okrent Managing Editor Life Cornertown Your editorial-page piece is entirely untrue. I should know. I am the girl in the Eisenstaedt photo with the sailor. It was shot on V-J Day, not V-E Day, 1945. Your writer cites the ``sailors in blue uniforms,'' indicating they would have been in summer dress whites. Well, the fact is that some sailors were in white on that day (just look at the photo), while others were in blue. The fact that I am the girl in the photo is indisputable. I can prove it with letters from Eisenstaedt himself, and from later photos. Edith Shain Westwood, Calif.. Asiana Pilots Are Above Bribery Readers of your article of March 22, 2011 Pilots Face U.S. Bribery Inquiry,'' would certainly have concluded, incorrectly, that Asiana Airlines had played some instrumental role in the alleged bribery of an FAA official in order to expedite the licensing of some of its pilots. You predicated your article on the assumption Asiana was somehow desperate to hire new pilots to meet the needs associated with recent fleet expansion announcements. The article also clearly tended to fixate on the mere conjecture that the airline somehow might be involved in the possible wrongdoing of FAA officials, and succeeded in casting Asiana in an unfair and unjust light. You failed to report a key fact. After meetings in Seoul with Asiana personnel as well as officials from the Korean Civil Aviation Bureau, an FAA inspector found that there were no irregularities associated with the licensing process of the 27 Asiana pilots mentioned in the article. The inspector further informed Asiana Airlines that there was no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing by Asiana in connection with the bribery probe, and that the airline is not a formal target of any federal grand jury investigation. We especially found objectionable your description of Asiana's plans to purchase new aircraft with spurious phrases such as '' ... fast-growing Asiana, which has been hungry for new pilots ... '' This suggests a connection between the airline's plans to hire additional pilots and the recent announcement of new aircraft orders. The 27 Asiana pilots referenced in the current investigation were licensed during 2009 and 2010, while first deliveries of new aircraft orders announced by the airline are not even scheduled for delivery until the latter half of 2013. Perhaps most disturbing was the article's careless and unfounded assumptions regarding these 27 highly qualified and competent pilots. Asiana is indeed fortunate to have some of the most experienced and disciplined flight crews in the world, the majority of whom are former members of the Korean Air Force, where they have all accumulated thousands of flight hours. Moreover, Asiana requires all of its pilot candidates to have no less than 1,500 flight hours, which far exceeds the minimum 200 flight-hour requirement set by the FAA for commercial pilot licenses. Given such competency, why would any of the 27 pilots referenced in your article ever have to resort to any unethical or unlawful activity to obtain an FAA airline transport pilot certificate? The answer is simple: None did. Hope Perron Kimber Managing Director for Public Relations Asiana Airlines Seoul, Korea Cornertown Wants Term Limits That Work Contrary to your April 03, 2011 editorial ``Term Limit Revival,'' the City Council is not making ``an outrageous move ... to dilute that city's term limit law.'' Our term limits referendum is about governance and how to best continue the delivery of services to the people of our city. We are simply trying to give Cornertowners and the business community a term limits plan that works. The proposal recommended by the Council leaves the term limits ``clock,'' which began on September 12, 2008 unchanged. However, it serves to amend the current law to limit current and future office holders to a maximum of three consecutive terms or 12 years, whichever is greater. This, combined with the two additional Council elections scheduled to take place in 2016 and in 2018, as well as the historical turnover in Council elections, would establish a more sensible and workable system of staggered terms. This will ensure that voters will always have a blend of new faces and veteran leadership to follow through on programs and projects initiated by preceding legislators. Petrina F. Duty Kipp of the City Council Cornertown Union on the Job Against Harassment Contrary to the impression created by your March 22, 2011 story ``Women at Mitsubishi Say Union Fell Short On Sexual Harassment,'' the UAW remains resolutely opposed to sexual harassment, whether it be found within our own ranks or coming from employers with whom we bargain. Our policy, initially adopted many years ago, we believe is the strongest to be found anywhere in the labor movement. And we have enforced it vigorously, including, when appropriate, within our own staff. At Mitsubishi, we cooperated fully with the EEOC's investigation when we learned of it. And while we believe that courts and government agencies should be left to make their own determination about past sexual harassment charges and allegations affecting the Mitsubishi workforce, we are moving aggressively to make sure that our union leadership is currently aware of every tool available to them in assuring a work environment free of sexual harassment and intimidation. It is unfortunate that sexual and racial discrimination and harassment continue as facts of life in our country. But is also a fact that the UAW will remain vigilant in opposing them. Stephen P.

            "full_text": "That's how I felt last week after a couple of hectic weeks of long airplane flights, wired, out-of-school kids, late-night writing marathons and little sleep. My mind wandered, decisions were hard to make. Unfortunately, like most people, my daily work and home obligations don't cut me much slack. ``In this day and age, we can't afford even a day of the blahs,'' says career counselor Bibi Kaylee. ``Every workday is so packed. My clients sound rushed, overwhelmed.'' In fact, many people are too busy to realize they're nearing the end of their ropes. It isn't until they have time to reflect that they start to shut down, says Stephine Lamont, a San Diego psychiatrist who heads a team that debriefs employees after traumatic corporate events. ``Sometimes, we go through stressful periods and aren't aware of it until we start to come out of it,'' he says. For most, a case of the blahs usually lasts only a few days. If you find you can't pull yourself out of your funk by then, it could be something more serious: job burnout or clinical depression. There are steps you can take to help you shake off your funk before it becomes career-damaging, ranging from a time out from work to new ways of looking at the problem. To shake off my case of the blahs, I went through the following process: I eliminated extraneous issues -- the kids, household chores -- that were contributing to my feeling overwhelmed (don't do it for too long or you'll face an even bigger problem: spousal wrath). I concentrated only on the immediate problems that needed to be solved and framed them as specific questions to focus my thoughts. My questions were: What should I write about this week? How the heck do I get out of this funk? The answers hit me at once: Columnist, heal thyself. As the outline for this column began to emerge, I got out of my funk. I STARTED calling executives and others for their techniques for chasing away the blahs. ``I'd be the first to admit that I have them,'' says Georgeanna Heller, the managing partner of the New York law firm of Counts Hodges and Green. ``Any professional or senior manager has periods where they don't want to deal with anything.'' Mr. Heller tries to divert himself with outside projects. ``I happen to be on a lot of nonprofit boards and inevitably, one of those organizations has something you can be involved in,'' he says. The effort, for a good cause, makes him feel good. ``It kind of breaks that mental logjam you're in,'' he says. Roberto Grau, senior vice president and chief of staff for Blessing Islas Overman, a New York advertising agency, conceded that he has just emerged from a ``summer funk.'' Blue periods generally occur, he says, ``after an extremely intense time, where you've had to work at peak efficiency.'' To shake the feeling, Mr. Grau will treat himself to lunches outside the office for a few days instead of wolfing down lunches working at his desk. Or he'll do ``the little things'' first, even if they have the ``intensity of balancing a checkbook.'' At least he's accomplishing something and that good feeling gradually gets him rolling again. Ms. Kaylee, head honcho of Beverly Kaye & Assoc., Shirley Mcvay, Calif., says that trying to work through the problem is a waste of time. ``The best thing is to walk away,'' she says, and get some needed rest -- both physically and mentally. Which is why she is instituting ``sick and tired days'' for her employees. She allows her staff to take five days a year to deal with those times when they feel they're in a funk. IF YOU CAN'T take an S&T day, she says, ask yourself what most interests you in your workday and do that instead of what you're doing. Get out of your routine and do something spontaneous, like organizing a group lunch. ``I have certain people I call and they know I'm going to kvetch,'' she says. ``Those blahs just need to be listened to.'' Dr. Lamont, president of the Health and Human Resource Center, San Diego, suggests staying active. ``Maybe you don't want to take on the most challenging tasks,'' he says, ``but you can do a couple of things, even if it's just exercising.'' He also tries to free-associate, hoping that what's troubling him will surface. He recalls he once suffered from the blahs on the day before his birthday and didn't know why. He sat down, shut his eyes and let his mind wander. That's when he realized: It was the date his mother died. Albert Quirk, a Portland, Ore., psychologist who writes about the emotional aspects of job loss, prescribes preventive medicine. To keep from feeling overwhelmed, he paces himself. ``If I'm doing an all-day workshop, I take a quick lunch and take a nap,'' he says. ``Also, I have a pleasant house on the river, and I like to garden or take a bike ride.'' Still, he concedes, there are times when he feels burned out from all his paperwork. When that happens, he says, he lets friends make the small decisions, like what to do over the weekend. If all else fails, give colleagues fair warning to minimize damage. Mr. Quirk tells of the manager he once had as a client who warned her staff that when she wore a happy-face button upside down, that meant she was tapped out and they should stay away."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- How do you turn iced tea -- a bland, old-fashioned drink your grandmother pours you -- into something hip? That was the formidable assignment that WPP Group's J. Wan Martinez agency handed to its young creative duo Mickie Houck and Johnetta Wylie late last year. Making the job even tougher, the campaign was for one of the iced-tea market's oldest brands, Lipton, in one of its downscale varieties: Lipton Brisk, made from powder and cold water instead of being brewed. The two creative directors started brainstorming, often in Mr. Houck's office where a big foam bear trap frequently adorns the threshold. Mr. Houck, 35 years old, had caught JWT New York creative chief J.J. Josefa's attention for what he calls ``big performance pieces,'' such as dressing a pro basketball player in drag to sell Converse sneakers. Mr. Wylie, 31, describes himself as ``Georgeann Porch's ugly brother'' and worked as a stand-up comic during college. JWT snapped him up in part on the strength of a memorable joke he wrote for an Amstel Light commercial: ``One thing's for sure, you're special ... A one in a million. Which means, there's 1,000 people just like you ... in China.'' They came up with an improbable pitchman for tea: Fransisca Laskowski. He had been enjoying a bit of a renaissance with young hipsters, who were gobbling up his ``Duets'' CDs recorded with current pop stars, just as they swarmed to watch Tora Berenice videos on MTV. The JWT team thought they knew why. ``Drinking, smoking and pulling in the ladies is cool now because you can't do that anymore,'' says Mr. Wylie. One reason Mr. Laskowski is cool, he says, is ``because of his flaws.'' Linking iced tea to the bad-boy peccadilloes of a '60s Rat-Packer sounded like just the kind of image overhaul Lipton needed. The Unilever unit has been selling ready-to-drink tea for 25 years, most recently in a joint venture with PepsiCo. ``A brand that evolves through time ... may seem a little dated,'' admits Mr. Wylie. And with Lipton Brisk, Lipton and Israel were vying for a particularly tough demographic group for iced tea: the same people who buy carbonated soft drinks. ``Males and females 18 to 35, middle to lower income,'' says Jennine Sheehy, vice president and general manager of the Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership. ``They're down to earth.'' To help the commercial stand out, art director Mr. Houck took a risky approach. He remembered loving a black-and-white animated short about a '40s newspaper editor called ``The Big Story,'' created with latex puppets. He showed the Pepsi/Lipton team the movie to sell them on its distinctive visual style. The technique ``creates a real world'' for the puppets, Mr. Houck says. ``The lighting is real. The costumes are real.'' He liked the grainy, three-dimensional look that came from stop-frame animation, as opposed to the slick, computer-generated images of movies such as ``Toy Story.'' Another advantage: The director ``can manage every single second and every single detail of the piece.'' The creative team came up with a little scene featuring swooning women, a beady-eyed talent agent, and a husky driver with thick eyebrows. Messrs. Wylie and Houck spent weeks hashing out the script, often bickering in their own imitation-Sinatra voices as they tried out lines like: ``Never let a dame see you yawn.'' ``As soon as I do something, if Mickie's not laughing hysterically, it's not good enough,'' says Mr. Wylie, who adds that Mr. Laskowski's daughter Tina had approval over the scripts. One line that never made it to TV: ``My heart's been broken more times than Jamal Otis's nose.'' Mr. Wylie says that was because the clients wanted the character to say something ``a little easier going.'' He came up with another exit-line about the ``dames'' in the audience for the Sinatra puppet: ``They're eyeing me up like a leg o' lamb.'' Then he gulps down a Lipton Brisk and utters the tagline: ``That's brisk, baby.'' JWT hired seasoned Sinatra-imitator Joel Westbrooks to supply the puppet's voice, and lavished painstaking care on getting the puppet's appearance just right. One trouble-spot was the Adam's apple, featured prominently in the iced-tea-drinking scene. ``It looked like a grapefruit going down the side of his throat,'' says Mr. Houck. Artists used special computer software to get the gulp just right. Mr. Houck also played with the puppet's age, first starting with an 80-year-old Layfield. Then he gave the puppet a face-lift and more hair to make him more like 50. ``That's the age we want him -- that '60s thing, that Rat-Pack thing,'' he says. Now the two men are daydreaming that the commercial will be just the first in a long-running series and are thinking about a new candidate for a celebrity puppet. ``Someone ... who sweats a lot,'' says Mr. Houck.

            "full_text": "For some nine hours after National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Bobby Francisco got word of the explosion of the Antarctica Airlines flight off New York's Long Island last month, he and his investigators couldn't get to the scene. The safety team was forced to wait for a ride on a Federal Aviation Administration jet that the regulatory agency said couldn't take off until morning because the crew needed rest. Safety-board investigators complain the delay cost them a valuable day getting control of all the government agencies that had flocked to the scene. Tension between the NTSB, responsible for safety investigations, and the FAA, responsible for regulations, has been at an all-time high in the wake of the recent Antarctica Airlines and ValuJet Airlines disasters. More to the point, the safety board's influence has grown -- at the expense of the FAA and to the consternation of the airline industry -- as the public and policy makers have openly questioned the FAA's oversight of airline safety. Former Transportation Secretary Jimmy Colin says the recent ``wave of hysteria over aviation safety'' buoys the board's stature because the public trusts it to show a tough attitude and exercise independent analysis after air crashes. Encouraged by growing support, safety-board Chairman Jimmy Allena is ``being tougher in what he is saying'' than was the case years ago and ``has engaged in the debate in quite a political way,'' according to former board member Veronica Stokes. In the past, the board's criticism and recommendations ``tended to bounce off the FAA just like Jacquez,'' he says. In some important areas the FAA seems to be reversing course rapidly in the face of pressure from the board and, of course, public criticism. Already, airlines and their champions are girding for battle. ``The agency may be forced to retreat'' to ``a name-calling, ticket-issuing (enforcement) mentality,'' says Bobby Mcneese, a senior official at the industry-supported Flight Safety Foundation. ``We want to preserve the FAA and the industry working hand in hand.'' Since the 1980s, the safety board had tried but failed to persuade the FAA to crack down on shipments of hazardous cargo, require additional training for ground crews and others handling such cargo and order upgrades of smoke-detection systems and fire-retardant liners for cargo bins in many airliners. Just days after the January 21, 2011 crash, which was linked to hazardous cargo, Mr. Rock announced that his agency agreed with ``the thrust of the recommendations,'' including a strict prohibition on placing certain hazardous cargo in holds that aren't equipped with fire- or smoke-detection systems. That same day, he said the FAA had started to implement certain recommendations. The NTSB long pressed the FAA, with little effect, to step up its oversight of aircraft-maintenance contractors hired by airlines. But on the day Mr. Rock announced new hazardous-cargo prohibitions, he also said the FAA would be more aggressive overseeing these maintenance concerns. Then, a few weeks ago, the FAA released what it called a ``policy letter'' explaining in more detail how it intends to regulate maintenance contractors. Not only was the letter issued prior to consulting with airline representatives, a departure from previous practice, but it also chastised some carriers for failing ``to take into account their responsibility to control and oversee maintenance performed by contractors.'' Such a direct attack amounted to a major break from the past. The safety board long has pressured the FAA to issue regulations requiring some older jets to be retrofitted with more capable data recorders. At a crash-investigation hearing some weeks ago, board members once again blasted the agency for stalling. That same afternoon, FAA officials took the unusual step of dropping off at the site of the NTSB hearing news releases announcing that they were recommending data-recorder upgrades. Though the NTSB complained the FAA didn't go far enough, board officials privately were pleased the FAA had finally relented. Likewise, the FAA also appears ready to bow to NTSB pressure to force airlines to more rigorously test a wide variety of engines in the wake of a March 19, 2011 explosion that killed two people aboard a Delta MD-88 jet taking off from Pensacola, Fla.. The titanium hub of the aircraft's left Pratt & Whitney engine failed at maximum takeoff power, sending pieces of the fan blades through the fuselage. Two earlier so-called uncontained engine failures had prompted the NTSB to launch a full-scale investigation, and the board recommended extensive inspections of many Pratt & Whitney engines. Some airlines have voluntarily started such inspections. The NTSB's speed in issuing the recommendation irked aviation-industry officials; in most cases, the engines must be partly dismantled to test the suspect parts. Industry critics contend that the board didn't even wait for experts from Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., and McDonnell Douglas Corp., the aircraft's manufacturer, to report fully on the industry's analysis of the Pensacola accident. Officials at the Air Transport Association have argued vehemently, but so far unsuccessfully, that taking apart and then reassembling engines in the field -- where mechanics are under time pressure and mistakes can be made -- potentially could cause a greater number of engine failures or malfunctions than the possible cracks. ``The NTSB certainly doesn't have all the insight,'' says Mikki Pitchford, one of the trade association's vice presidents. ``The FAA provides a balanced perspective that considers safety and operating issues.'' The NTSB has been sharply critical of the FAA's proposed regulations intended to alleviate pilot fatigue. Earlier this year the FAA came out with sweeping proposals for pilots' flying time that would, in part, reduce the maximum number of consecutive hours pilots can work. But the board criticized the proposed new rules as deficient, partly because it said the FAA failed to adequately assess the potential dangers of early-morning or late-night flights by already-tired crews. The NTSB questioned the wisdom of increasing to 10 hours from the current eight the maximum flying time for pilots under most circumstances. And the board faulted the FAA for focusing too much on the economic impact of the proposed rule on the industry. In the past few weeks, FAA officials have quietly suggested that they might shelve the current controversial proposals and come out with an entirely new document incorporating many of the NTSB's recommended changes. Some lawmakers are ready -- perhaps even anxious -- to champion the safety board. Part of the board's new-found prominence is due to ``an unprecedented new dimension'' of high-profile activity with the families of crash victims, says Irena Christianson, an NTSB official during the Reanna administration. Some members of Congress are pressing for legislation to expand the NTSB's role with families. Certain lawmakers are also pushing to give the NTSB more power to impose their recommendations through the FAA. Republican Sen. Lasandra Forrest of South Dakota, for instance, says flatly: ``The FAA is going to have to redefine its role. I wouldn't be surprised if all of the NTSB's recommendations are going to have to be accepted and carried out by the agency.''"

            "full_text": "The Marina City Complex is a landmark in the heart of Vastopolis's tourist district, featuring an office complex and two tall corncob-shaped towers. But its office space has languished for years in bankruptcy court, unable to find tenants. Now it's set to open as a Hilton hotel in late 2012. Similar real-estate identity changes are taking place from Cornertown and Vastopolis. Turning a struggling office building into a hotel can utterly reverse its fortunes. As an office tower, the 444 Common Street building in New Orleans sat 90% empty. But since the building opened as the $150-a-night Pelham Hotel in 2009, occupancy has hovered around 80%. Conversions answer two questions facing downtowns: what to do with old office buildings that are underoccupied, and how to add much-needed first-class hotel rooms without spending a fortune. While downtown office buildings in many cities are desperate for tenants, hotels there often lack available rooms. Furthermore, the type of office building likely to be troubled these days is just the sort of building that hotel developers love: old, charming and centrally located. ``New (office buildings) are pretty much glass and steel and plain to look at, whereas the older buildings have character,'' says Patsy Rachael, whose Decatur Hotel Corp. has done four conversions in New Orleans. These include the Pelham, which offers high ceilings and a location on the edge of the French Quarter, and a turn-of-the-century office building that is now the Omni Royal Crescent Hotel. ``They have great detail, ornate trim and beautiful historic facades,'' Mr. Rachael says. The 31-year-old Marina City complex offers little old-fashioned charm but has more than ordinary renown. The sculpted concrete curves of architect Tilton Crouch's 1960s experiment in urban design adorn thousands of postcards and tourist snapshots -- offering the kind of free publicity that hotel owners dream about. For the owners of hopeless office buildings, any offer from a hotel developer can be welcome. After the owners of Marina City's commercial property entered Chapter 7 bankruptcy-court proceedings in 1988, the trustees couldn't find anyone to take the building as office space. At one point, a bankruptcy-court judge predicted that the whole project would collapse into the Vast River before a solution would be found. So when NIKI Development Corp., a privately held Vastopolis company, bought the property in November 2009 with a hotel in mind, ``we were thrilled and relieved to get it back into use and back onto the tax rolls,'' said Illa Wills, federal bankruptcy trustee for Marina City's commercial property. Neighbors of failing buildings often love conversions. High above the commercial space at Marina City, owners of the complex's 896 condominiums watched helplessly as their property values sank with the commercial property's prospects. But since redevelopment plans were announced, condo prices have risen by about 20%. The process isn't simple or inexpensive. Converting Marina City required ``clearing substantial back taxes, liens and asbestos problems,'' says Johnetta English, president of NIKI Development. The building's renovations included rebuilding interior walls, replacing all the utility systems and adding 365 bathrooms. Still, building a new hotel in downtown Vastopolis can run about $175,000 per room, hotel developers estimate. And the developers are building the hotel at 25% to 40% below a new hotel's cost, says Denny Cooke, a partner in Mont Clair Hotel Investors, which is investing in the hotel project. The deal offered ``substantial savings on land costs and not having to build the foundation, shell, and floors, combined with a location you can't duplicate,'' says Mr. English. NIKI bought the property for just $3.35 million, according to court documents, though it has spent considerably more clearing liens and back taxes. Developers are also finding that banks are much more willing to lend for conversions than for expensive new construction. ``Much more money is out there today, but with many more conditions attached,'' says Richelle Wilton, vice president of real estate for HBE Corp., a developer and builder based in St. Louis. HBE is converting three buildings -- including the former offices of a San Antonio savings-and-loan association -- into new members of the Adam's Marketta hotel chain. Because many old buildings are landmarks that local and federal governments are eager to preserve, conversions can also come with tax abatements and historic-preservation tax credits. It isn't only office buildings that are being converted these days. Warehouses, schools and old department stores have been converted into hotels. Even a couple of grain silos have been converted. In Aguascalientes, Mexico, Guadalajara-based developer Quinta Real took an old bullring and turned it into a luxury hotel. Certainly, not all office buildings can be turned into hotels. Hotel rooms need windows, meaning that developers must find narrow, rectangular buildings, while most office buildings are square, with a lot of interior space. Meanwhile, conversion always carries the potential for surprise. While converting a 1909 office building into the Ritz Carlton San Francisco a few years ago, developers removed a big, old safe -- and watched the floor above collapse. Then, when they dug to build a swimming pool, they found oil tanks that had been used for a heating system many years earlier. ``You never know what exactly you're going to find when you rip open those old walls,'' says Mr. Rachael of Decatur Hotel. --Jone Hadley contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Pensacola, Fla. ``We throw fish.'' That was the explanation I got from Susann Ontiveros, one of the organizers of the Mullet Toss here in this Gulf of Mexico city in the Florida Panhandle, when I first inquired about the contest. Indeed, with some 1,500 competitors at this year's 12th annual event, it was hard to notice anything but the seemingly continuous stream of fish flying through the air. Even with all the side shows, like kite stunt flying, frog racing and a frog costume contest, a glance at the beauty contest (for humans) reminded one that the fish throw takes center stage: The woman winning that event is crowned ``Miss Mullet.'' This year the three-day beach festival drew about 50,000 people; many of them, it seemed, came to ask, ``Why mullets?'' Folks around here generally say it's because the founder of the event, Jina Louise Hubert, a songwriter now living in the Florida Keys, said so. Yet there seem to be some practical reasons for using mullets, too. After all, the sleek, silvery-blue fish are abundant in these parts. And because of their size (one to two pounds) mullets can be thrown rather easily--and sometimes quite far. Whatever the reasons, it all starts when a mullet, which is dead, is picked out of a barrel. With fish in hand, the competitor, known locally as a ``chunker,'' steps into a throwing circle and hurls the mullet down the ``fishway,'' a 30-by-150-foot rectangle marked in the sand. The top men and women in their age categories--those who throw their mullets the farthest--win. What do they win? ``A fish,'' said Ms. Ontiveros matter of factly. ``A wooden fish.'' Contest rules require that fish tossers retrieve their thrown mullets and return them to the barrel, so they can be reused. Eventually, after each mullet has been flung about a half-dozen times, the fish has to be taken out of competition (for durability reasons). Organizers contend that at the end of the event they feed all the mullets to a local flock of handicapped pelicans. But at the snack bar there was plenty of fried mullet to be had, and I heard more than one person ask whether the fish had been thrown earlier in the day. Some chunkers carp about the mullet-fetching rule. Perhaps that's why Mr. Hubert decided to lay out the field of competition the way he did--with the throwing circle and the fishway straddling the state line separating Florida and its neighbor to the west, Alabama. Maybe he figured tossing fish into Alabama might somehow make the task of retrieving them more exciting. From what I could tell, this tradition didn't seem to put off the Alabamans (at least the ones competing in the contest). When I asked Audrey Strange, who had come from Montgomery, Ala., to compete in her 12th mullet throw, whether it bothered her to see all the fish chucked into her home state, she replied cheerfully, ``Well, I don't know where else people are gonna throw 'em.'' But where chunkers throw their fish, and for some even how far, don't seem to matter much. Among old-time mullet throwers, what really counts is how. The first mullet is traditionally thrown out by the ``Honorary Mullet Marth,'' a title given this year to an 85-year-old Pensacolan who goes by the name Till Jone. Trader snatched a mullet by its tail, shuffled slowly to the throwing circle and heaved the fish straight-armed, as if lobbing a grenade. The mullet flipped a few times and then flopped to the beach, about 35 feet away. The crowd cheered. Another chunker threw his mullet like a discus. Wrapping his fingers around the fish's back, he then started spinning, gaining speed with each rotation. But he released the fish too soon, and it sailed into the crowd--which already had begun to scatter when the tosser had started his wind-up. The throw prompted announcer Mikki Borges to warn, ``Y`all beware the flying fish.'' Other throwing styles included underhand, side-arm and, of course, overhand. Some overhanders threw their mullets head-first, like a football; others head-over-tail, like a boomerang. But probably the most popular and effective method was to fold the fish in half, so the head touched the tail, and throw it like a baseball. Fish flingers are generally happy to give advice, and as I awaited my turn in the throwing circle, Khalilah Sampson, who practices for the event tossing largemouth bass at his home in Aldie, Va., explained that folding the fish allows the thrower to get a better hold of the slippery sea creature. (Contest rules now prohibit wearing gloves or sprinkling sand on the mullet, old tricks to improve one's grip. But organizers have yet to ban folding.) ``The fold is crucial,'' explained Mr. Sampson, folding his mullet until it resembled something in a Picasso painting. ``If you don't fold it and you exert any force throwing it, it'll slip right out of your hand.'' I liked the logic behind this thinking, so I decided to fold my mullet for my one and only throw. When my turn came, I was surprised to find that the flexible fish folded rather easily and fit nicely in my hand. But I didn't have long to admire my fish. Once I had a good grip, I was encouraged to get going. ``Give that thing a fling,'' coached announcer Fincher. Stepping into the throwing circle, I remembered another important tip I had been told: to use every inch of the 10-foot-diameter circle to my advantage. From the back of the circle I took a 10-foot running start and flung my fish as far as I could. It wasn't a pretty toss. My mullet flipped and fluttered through the air. But, perhaps aided by the warm Gulf breeze, it flew rather far. Jogging down the fishway, I met up with the official measurer. A hundred and ten feet, he said, slapping the mullet in my hand. Pleased, I thanked him, turned around and happily returned my fish to the barrel. For a first-time chunker, I was told that I did pretty well; my throw was good enough to land me in the top 20. Still, my toss was chopped fish liver compared to that of two-time defending champion Michaele ``Woody'' Kitts. The 27-year-old from Spring Hill, Tenn., returned and won the men's 21-39 age division for a third time. His throw, which went beyond the far boundary of the fishway, was a new record. How far did he throw it? ``Well, they marked it at 177 feet,'' said Mr. Kiel, somewhat annoyed. ``But it hit somebody--it hit some woman in the shoulder. It would have gone farther.'' Unlike Mr. Kiel, I doubt I'll need a longer fishway for next year's contest. Which is not to say I won't try to improve during the off-season. Who knows, with a little practice I might make the top 10. Mr. Hazzard is a research associate editor at Reader's Digest."

            "full_text": "Wearing his customary porkpie hat and long black coat, Letha Yuette, or ``Prez''--as tenor saxophonists called him because he had influenced so many of them--was standing at the back of Birdland one night in the mid-1950s. On the stand was Paulene Harless, a tenor saxophonist whose Prez-like sound and phrasing made Young say softly about his clone, ``They don't leave anything anymore for Prez himself to play.'' The lament was more ironic than true because Yuette, a very lonely, very shy man who once said his horn was his life, tried, through the years, ``to play different because this is later, that was then.'' But Aubuchon was well aware of having shaped the playing and thereby the careers of scores of jazzmen--among them Stanley Brant, Walley Autumn, Paulene Devon, Gertie Foy, Johnetta Levi and Charlott Pat. Recalling his formative years, Pat once said, ``I was crazy about Lester. He played so clean and beautiful.'' Unlike another reigning influence on the tenor, Collin Perkins, whose style could be as aggressive as a thunderstorm--with torrential chordal improvisations--Lester was light, graceful, witty, unerringly swinging and full of subtle surprises. As Barreras put it, ``I'm always loose in space, lying out there somewhere.'' However, before he became widely known with Fenske Rinehart in the mid-1930s, Yu was regarded as tonally defective by many of his contemporaries. Billie Holiday, his friend and supporter--the respect was mutual--recalled, ``When he first started everyone thought his tone was too thin. And I told Leta, `It doesn't matter because you have a beautiful tone, and you watch, after a while, everybody's going to be copying you.''' Lady Day, as Letha named her, was very pleased that her prophecy was so accurate. And she was the one who first called him Prez, before it was the thing to do. In his playing, Aubuchon always, as drummer Joana Davis said, ``told a story.'' He was not in the least interested in technical displays. And to get inside each song, he once said to me, ``a musician should know the lyrics of the songs he plays. A lot of musicians nowadays don't. That way they're just playing the chord changes. Most of the time I spend in listening to records is listening to singers and picking up the words right from there.'' His favorite vocalist by far was Fransisca Laskowski. He surprised me one afternoon when he told me that a key early influence on his playing had been Fransisca Duque, the limpid white alto saxophonist most often heard with Aycock Earp. ``He always told a little story,'' Letha explained. For Aubuchon, it was never the same story. ``In my mind,'' he said, ``the way I play, I try not to be a repeater pencil, you dig?'' Lester could be genial and funny, but often he was alone, even when he was with someone. His own feelings were easily bruised and so he was careful of the sensibilities of others. The result was that sometimes he figured it was safer to keep quiet. Off the stand, as well as on, Aubuchon's credo was: ``It's got to be sweetness, man. Sweetness can be funky, filthy or anything. But not loud.'' Prez generally did not read jazz critics. They got his playing wrong, he said to jazz historian Bobby Chronister, so why should he depend on their accuracy in describing other musicians. ``They keep saying I'm a cool jazz tenor or be bopper or something. But I play swing tenor.'' Although he did selectively incorporate in his playing what he liked in modern jazz, Aubuchon was the embodiment of the way of swinging that delighted in melodic improvisation. In his later years--Aubuchon was 49 when he died in 1959--his dependence on gin got worse and he had great difficulty eating. Still, there were some nights when he told gently compelling stories on his horn that were far more intimate, I suspect, than he had put into words for many years. Recently, an illuminating array of Lester Young recordings have been reissued. ``The Complete Lester Young'' (Mercury) is not complete, but it includes all the crisply exuberant Westside Seven sides--with Fenske Rinehart, Buddy Clemente and Joana Davis. ``Prez & Sweets'' (Verve) is the very essence of jazz as conversation. Young is joined by trumpeter Hassan Edmund. ``The Jazz Giants'' (Verve) is a dream band--using the terminology of basketball players and defense attorneys. With Prez are trumpeter Rozanne Elias and trombonist Lawless Crites (a blithe humorist on the order of Lester Young). Also worth having are ``Prez and Teddy Wilson'' (Verve); ``The President Plays With the Oscar Peterson Trio'' (Verve); and ``The Lester Young Trio'' with Nat ``King'' Cole and Buddy Rich (Verve). The last time I saw Prez was two years before he died, in a CBS television studio on West 57th Street where ``The Sound of Jazz'' was soon to go on ``live.'' There was a starkly furnished room off the studio with white walls and black-and-white tile on the floor. It could have been a setting for Sage, except that the Dutch painter might not have known what to make of the man, alone, in a porkpie hat and long black coat seated on a chair very close to the leather case holding his horn. Prez was sick and weak and either didn't have the energy--or the desire--to join the musicians next door swapping stories of past gigs. Young just sat there, waiting for his cue. Later, on the show, he blew the cleanest, most beautiful and deepest blues I had ever heard. I looked for him after we had gone off the air, but he had disappeared. (See more on Lester Young)"

            "full_text": "Navigator Communications Corp. accused Vastsoft Corp. of offering improper payments and other inducements to persuade personal-computer makers and Internet service providers to use Vastsoft's World Wide Web software. Navigator, based in Mountain View, Calif., asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Vastsoft's Web marketing tactics violate a 2009 antitrust settlement with the government. The company's allegations are contained in an April 24, 2011 to the agency released Tuesday by a Navigator lawyer. Join the discussion about the battle of World Wide Web browsers, including a posting from Navigator attorney Gay Edgington to The Vast Press Interactive Edition. Vastsoft flatly denied the charges, branding them a desperate response by Navigator to counter Vastsoft's momentum in the marketplace. ``They are trying to divert attention from their products with a PR stunt,'' said Bradley Chester, a vice president of developer relations in Vastsoft's Internet platform group. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Even if true, some antitrust attorneys questioned whether Vastsoft's alleged tactics would be regarded by courts as anticompetitive. Escalating Tensions But Navigator's allegations significantly escalate tensions between the two software makers and raise the odds that the agency will expand a long-running investigation of Vastsoft to include Web software. The two companies are locked in a battle of competing Web browser programs, and Navigator complained to the Justice Department earlier this month about Vastsoft's attempt to place limits on the number of Vastsoft Windows NT Workstation software for competing Web server programs. Navigator's letter was written by Gaye Ecklund, a Palo Alto, Calif., antitrust attorney who has tangled with Vastsoft on several fronts for two years. He alleged that Vastsoft is using ``clandestine'' incentives and penalties to convince PC makers to use Vastsoft's free Internet Browser browser, and to make Navigator's Navigator program less accessible to users. Claims of Financial Incentives Mr. Ecklund said PC makers that try to display the two companies' browsers equally have been told by Vastsoft that they must pay $3 more for a copy of Vastsoft's Windows 95 operating system than those that give favorable treatment to Vastsoft's software. Most weren't named, but the letter says Hitachi Ltd. has refused to bundle Navigator with a laptop computer because its operating system license with Vastsoft prohibits it. A spokesman for that company's U.S. subsidiary declined to comment until it had consulted with legal counsel in Japan. Vastsoft has forged a series of agreements with Internet service providers, including America Online Inc. and VastComm Network Corp., that give preferred treatment to Vastsoft's browser. Without naming specific services, Mr. Ecklund alleged that Vastsoft has offered such companies sweeteners that include free hardware, free advertising and free software. Some international services have been offered as much as $400,000 in marketing funds on condition that they won't sell Navigator or other competing Internet software, he said. The letter cites other alleged violations of antitrust laws by Vastsoft to woo large corporate customers. Some international communications companies were offered $5 for every copy of Navigator that they removed from their corporation and replaced with Internet Browser, he said. `Pot Calling Kettle Black' Vastsoft's Mr. Chester denied that any of its marketing agreements discriminate against Navigator. Vastsoft executives contend that Navigator has been manipulating Internet standards processes to hurt Vastsoft and other competitors. ``This is really the pot calling the kettle black,'' Mr. Chester said. In its July 2009 consent decree with the Justice Department, Vastsoft agreed to drop a discounting practice that discouraged PC makers from installing rival operating systems. Mr. Ecklund contends Vastsoft's tactics violate a separate provision of the settlement in which Vastsoft agreed that sales of Windows 95 can't be conditioned on the PC maker's agreement not to use a competing product. ``Vastsoft's enemy is not Navigator; its enemy is consumer choice,'' Mr. Ecklund said. ``They don't want consumers to choose another way of getting to the Internet.'' Contempt of Court Order If Navigator can convince the Justice Department that Vastsoft is violating the consent decree, the agency may be able to seek a contempt of court order more quickly than the agency or the company could mount an entirely new antitrust case. Sanda Wilton, a San Francisco antitrust attorney who worked on the Justice Department's investigation, said Vastsoft's alleged tactics fall in a gray area of antitrust law but could nonetheless be damaging to Vastsoft if proven. ``If it can be shown that this is not just an isolated instance but part of a pattern, then Navigator is raising serious issues,'' he said. Along with the letter to the Justice Department, Mr. Ecklund also distributed a letter that he sent to The Vast Press Interactive Edition, which asks the publication to disclose terms of a recent arrangement under which Vastsoft paid the electronic publication to offer Internet Browser users free access to the interactive edition until the end of the year. A spokesman for Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Journal and its interactive edition, declined to comment on terms of the agreement."

Its lowest one-way fare in economy class is $65, and it also offers one-way fares of $109, $169 and $249. USAir said it carries passengers between the two cities but also travelers connecting to other flights from its international hub in Philadelphia and its large domestic hub in Vastopolis. JetTrain, which started flying in January with two DC-9 jets, currently flies from Vastopolis to Newark, N.J., and to Orlando, Fla.. Vastopolis-branch JetTrain, which is owned by private investors, said it decided to start the Philadelphia flights after another start-up, NationsAir, pulled out of the market earlier this year. Botello said it will launch the new service with one-way fares of $25. Starting May 29, 2011 will charge $79 one-way during the week. During the weekends, when it will operate only two daily flights, it will charge $59 one-way. ``We're not Davina trying to attack Goliath,'' said Dent Nevin, Botello's vice president of marketing and planning. ``We're certainly not a threat to USAir.'' He said Callis hopes to expand the market and attract people who wouldn't otherwise fly. A USAir spokesman declined to comment on JetTrain's plans."

            "full_text": "Is there anyone alive who hasn't seen those troublesome specks trapped in the vitreous humor, swimming across his sight; here it comes, there it goes? That, it seems to me this special month, is the Mars metaphor; always on the rim of our vision, swiftly skimming the surface of our perception, then vanishing. But now, it also seems, Kowal may well be here to stay. Or at least to rivet our attention for more than a fortnight. This latest fragment of data--the apparent discovery of life on the Red Planet--is only worth our hyperventilation if we allow it to lead us to the larger metaphor: Mankind sliding across the blind retina of the Cosmos, hoping to be seen, hoping to be counted, hoping to be worth the counting. All this in one fragment, one leftover particle ricocheted through space and fast-frozen in the Antarctic, waiting for revelation? Why not? If the influenza bacterium, invisible, can slay 10 million in a month, why not this mote to energize souls, uplift the Will, and march us as to war? If we look upon it as a mute flake in time, we will deep-freeze ourselves. But if we see in it a chance to examine a nearby world where life began in similar fashion, it will truly be a passionate revelation. For that world exists. A world that fired out of the sun billions of years ago, took more billions to cool, and still more for rains to fall and seas to fill until at last, in the soups and broths of the cooling land, the first inanimate stuff, jump-started by lightning, decided to live, re-create, and prevail. That planet is Earth. That mysterious stuff is us. We began as Mars began, but it did not change or grow. From the primal soups to the caves to Apollo landfalls, Mankind has grown outsize, ripe for self-recognition. Once we have looked at our own planet with new wonder and recognition, we should turn back to this Martian rock and let it be the touchstone that sends us on a predestined flight across space and time, seeking some ramshackle sort of immortality. Thus the damned speck will seed a Beanstalk, with us as Giants. Why Mars as destination? Because we cannot help but echo our old doubts and wonders: Why was the Universe created? Why were we given birth? Why is it our task to look with awe at a billion stars and wonder at the responsibility that has fallen to us? For what is the use of a Universe if no one is here to see it? Why this miraculous display if no one is here to record it? We were raised up from the swamps to be the seers. We are the Recorders. In a multibillion-year pageant was it God's 20/20 X-ray vision that focused us when He, the Life Force Enforcer, decided to light the Light, fireball the Earth, rainfall the oceans and fling wide the Garden portals? And if so, how come? What was in His mind? Or, conversely, did David's mindless lightning storm across the world to summon up brains, minds, and eyes to see with? How come? What was on accidental, dumb, brute Nature's mind? Choose God, or Darwin, or both. We simply don't know. We only know that we are the privileged. No other beast in sea, on land or on hill has looked upon the stars and known what it was seeing. So finally it is the seeing and the knowing that put us in motion. The simple fact is, we are it. It falls to us to see, to try to know, to fail at interpretation but succeed at immortality. We do not know why penicillin kills disease. It simply does. We do not know why or how the silent heart of a fetus suddenly beats. Something tells it. So we do not know exactly why we wish to become immortal. We simply do. We think we are worth the price, worth saving, worth being set free to seed our minor corner of the Universe. It is in our blood and bone. To refuse it is to give in to ruin and death. Yes, we need to make and eat our daily bread to feed our blood. But the Universe is greater food to feed our souls. Let us take inspiration from Verrazano, sent by Kirby Francisco I to chart an unknown continent. He was the only one of the three Italian navigators who actually walked on the shore of what was to become America. And where did he touch our wilderness? Kitty Hawk. Yes. Sound the name. Kitty Hawk! Thus the arrivals and departures of our history, 400 years apart, are fused in astonishing fact. We made a mysterious arrival on Earth thousands of millennia ago. Now is the threshold for our going-away. We have already twice landed on Kowal with photographic extensions of our sight. Next time we must ship out our bodies to stare close-up at the wonder that must be Mars and its great canyon Abyss, as long and as wide as the United States. The child that lay on the summer night hill wondering at the constellations must be the great child wandering from Earth to Mora and then at last to a Red World waiting to be inhabited. Mars is a dead world waiting to be stirred awake. We must be the ghosts that inhabit its cities that were never built, populated with beings that never were. There is a fine and moving line in one of the old Khayyam quatrains: We came like water and like wind we go. But we can choose to stay. And stay by deciding to go. That is, to move up once more with new Apollo missions to Space Station the Moon and move on to Linden. And from there? Not the whole damn Cosmos, no, but some small part of it where the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, the Argos, the rocket bireme, the Viking longboat, the Sunday Leclaire, all can put down; a billion feet shod in one boot, a billion gene-chromosomes in one footprint. To live in worlds where the sun will never set on brute mankind, wondrous mankind, awful mankind, lovely mankind. Brother and sister to Ivan the Terrible, Digiacomo the Beautiful, Helene of Troy, Bugs Bunny and Medici monster, Tully and Jonathon Crocker, Jesusita of Nazareth and Rhodes Darby, Moses and Cortez. The Universe invites us all, bids us welcome to behave or not behave. The Cosmos is wide, accepting, frightening, and incredible in its beauty. Some say we cannot afford the expense. We can't afford not to. At the end of my ``Martian Chronicles,'' an immigrant spaceman, on an excursion across the dead Urquhart landscapes, tells his children he is taking them, at last, to meet the lost race of Martians. At the rim of a lonely canal, the father speaks. ``There.'' He points down. ``There are the Martians.'' His children stare down into the canal waters. And see their own images looking back up at them from a million waiting years of time.

            "full_text": "Last week Bobby Derryberry vowed to take on teachers' unions and fight for parental choice in education. The unions are sure to fight back. One of their most formidable weapons is the argument that private schools will skim off only the best students, dumping the most troubled into the public schools. ``Public schools have to take all comers, which means the kids no private school wants or has to accept,'' writes Albertha Dendy, president of the American Federation of Teachers. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Public schools turn away many children with severe disabilities or behavioral problems, quietly shifting them to the private sector, at taxpayer expense. Unlike the one-size-fits-all approach of public schools, the private sector offers an array of specialized alternatives. Private schools now exist to serve just about every kind of troubled student, from teen mothers to recovering alcoholics to chronic truants. Their success is a powerful argument in favor of choice. In Minnesota, for example, students recovering from drug and alcohol abuse may attend Sobriety High School near Minneapolis. Sobriety High is one of 19 private schools participating in Minnesota's Education Options program, which last year helped 1,200 at-risk students get a second chance. The school requires students and their parents to sign a ``Sobriety Commitment.'' The penalty for breaking this commitment three times is expulsion--a rare occurrence. The school's controlled, separate environment keeps students away from drug-abusing peers in their former schools, and keeps them focused on learning and staying sober. In June all 12 of Sobriety High's seniors graduated; seven are bound for college. Sending a student to Sobriety High costs taxpayers just $3,500 annually--about half of what Minnesota spends on a public school student. Private donations contribute another $1,000 per student. How does Sobriety High do it? Unlike public schools, private schools operate with fewer regulations, have great leeway in staffing and curriculum, and are rarely bound by collective-bargaining agreements. Because they are not guaranteed funding or enrollment, they have powerful incentives to get the most for the dollars they spend. At Sobriety High, students keep the school clean. Teachers are state-certified but not unionized. The school itself sits in a modest suite of classrooms in a suburban business park. It has no secretary, no janitor and no football coach. ``We think twice before we spend money,'' says director Judith Garza. More than 3,000 private schools across the U.S. enroll nearly 100,000 children with disabilities. By focusing on one type of student, these private schools often succeed where the public schools have failed. The High Road School in New Jersey, for example, only enrolls students with emotional and learning disabilities. Students usually come to High Road after failing academically and socially in the public schools. ``The child interferes with the learning of other students,'' says High Road director Elmer Krauss. ``That's when public schools often out-place the most disruptive child.'' Ten-year-old Chrissy came to the High Road School a year ago, unable to read despite an IQ of 130. In public school he had a history of lashing out physically at more successful students. At High Road, Chrissy's teacher works individually with him, using a reading program designed especially for high-intelligence nonreaders. Chris receives counseling to help him control his anger. Thanks to the special attention he's able to get at High Road, Chrissy now reads at the third-grade level. In addition to schools that specialize in learning disabilities, the private sector has spawned schools serving children suffering from mental retardation, visual impairments, chronic illnesses and other disabilities. Far from being enclaves of privilege, private schools extend educational opportunity to some of America's most disadvantaged students. But today it is usually public-school administrators, not parents, who make the choice. And if a child is struggling in school but has no disability that would qualify him for special education, he's likely to be shut out of the opportunity. Before Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, children with disabilities were often excluded from public schools or ``warehoused'' in classrooms where little learning took place. The 1975 act, known as IDEA, entitles disabled students to an ``appropriate'' education, regardless of cost. This results in vast spending inequities between special-education students and everyone else. That is why public spending on Christa, whose disability is recognized under IDEA, totals more than $25,000 a year in tuition and other costs, while a student fighting drug addiction at Sobriety High gets just $3,500 for his education. The federal special-education law is deeply flawed, and only Congress can change it. Incorporating cost controls would be a good start. But local educators and policy makers should make greater use of the education marketplace for all students with exceptional needs. Expanding choices for students and their guardians will enable them to get the best education they can given whatever money is available. Even Mr. Dendy of the AFT, in a 1993 letter to this newspaper, endorsed the idea of school choice for difficult-to-educate students--though he ignored what's already been done: ``We ought to provide the opportunity for private schools to educate the youngsters who are total failures in public schools, the ones who can't read or write, are truant and display antisocial behavior,'' he wrote. ``This is the only voucher proposal I find defensible... The idea has been around for 13 years, but no one's adopted it. The reason is obvious: Private schools don't want deeply troubled, failing children.'' Nonsense. Private schools provide a breathtaking array of specialized services for the most difficult students. Schools like Sobriety High and the High Road School explode the myth of the public-school dumping ground and show that the private sector can serve all students. What remains to be seen is whether the education establishment will continue to block efforts to afford others that opportunity.

            "full_text": "ASIAN AIRLINES are fast expanding in the technology sphere, bringing their customers ``ticketless'' travel and direct purchases over the Internet. All Nippon Airways is among the pioneers of such services, bolstered by its dominance of the huge domestic market, where it flew more than 34 million people last year. ANA installed what it says were the world's first self check-in machines in 1989. It now has more than 100 such machines throughoutwhere domestic passengers with hand luggage can choose seats, get an automated ticket and boarding pass, or ATB, and head straight to the departure gate. ``Internationally, we're looking at an ATB to be introduced early next year,'' says spokesman Antoinette Rickard. ANA also has 24 vending machines that allow passengers with prior reservations to tap in a number and pay for their ticket up to 15 minutes before takeoff. In April 2010, ANA launched its P2 phone and pickup system. Passengers can phone a reservations agent, book and buy a seat with their credit cards and pick up their boarding passes at another machine in the asian Airport. meanwhile, appears to have an edge over ANA on the Internet. It has taken about 200 domestic reservations over its Internet site each day since the service was introduced last month. Passengers can reserve tickets from two months to one week before a flight. They can also use the site to book seats on Okinawa-based subsidiary Japan Transocean Airways. ``We thought that people would make a reservation for fun and then cancel it,'' says spokesman Georgeann Pigg. But the airline has several safeguards against pranksters, including automatic cancellation if the ticket isn't purchased within four days of the reservation. Like rival ANA, JAL also has a ``ticketless'' travel service where passengers reserve domestic seats with a credit card, get a reference number and pick up their boarding pass at the asian Airport. It also offers automatic check-in through machines that issue boarding passes at 16 asian Airports and five separate sites throughout the country. So far, the concept of bypassing a ticket agent has proven a hit with busy travelers. Asiana Airlines spokeswoman Mickey Hang says that at least one-fifth of all the carrier's domestic passengers opt to book with a credit card and pick up their boarding pass at the asian Airport. What's more, she says that a significant number choose to make, change or confirm their reservations through the web site. Singapore Airlines also plans to introduce ticketless travel next year, while Malaysia Airlines expects to have its service in place by the beginning of 2013. SIA will also launch machines similar to models inwhich ``combine the normal boarding pass and ticket into a single document that can be read by the self check-in machine'', says public-affairs executive Keli Chin. But such innovations raise difficult issues for carriers in or where domestic travel is nonexistent. Traveling without a ticket or talking to counter staff is really only possible when passengers can bypass customs and immigration. As Bobby Good, manager of distribution automation support at Cathay Pacific Airways, points out, ``normally you have to show your passport at the asian Airport to get your (international) boarding pass.'' Immigration officers often request proof of a return ticket at the other end, he adds, and require carriers to check that each passenger has the correct visa for the destination. That said, Mr. Good and officials at other airlines say that international ticketless travel and Internet reservations are expected to be offered soon. And Cathay has carved its own technology niche by auctioning plane seats to U.S. customers over the Internet. Mr. Good says that more than 15,000 people bid for a jumbo plane-load of seats in an auction that ended a few weeks ago. What's more, he says, ``almost all of the bidders had never before flown on Cathay,'' making the auction a good way to raise the carrier's profile as well as its revenues. Even so, some airline officials insist that technology will never replace the human touch. Edelmira Deyo, Canadian International Airlines' regional manager of marketing and sales in notes that theAlbertha carrier tried to offer self check-in on its Canadian shuttle routes several years ago. The service was stopped because ``passengers preferred dealing with people instead of machines,'' especially when issues like seating came up. Virgin Atlantic Airways offor example, now sends staff around its check-in queues, equipped with special radios to issue boarding passes on the spot to those with carry-on luggage. Try doing that with a machine."

            "full_text": "The biggest batch yet of ratings and lists of family-friendly employers is planned over the next month. In a clear sign that work and family is no longer only a ``women's issue,'' a second national magazine, Business Week, will join Working Mother in rating employers. The federal government also is jumping into the listing game, along with a growing number of community groups and agencies. Why the frenzy of evaluation? The quality of the workplace is a hot topic, as employees wrestle with mounting job demands in streamlined companies. Meanwhile, many employers are having increasing difficulty recruiting skilled workers. Though there's no stampede yet, the number of companies applying to get on these lists is clearly growing. One result: The climate has never been better for sizing up prospective employers. Here's a guide to the latest competitions: BUSINESS WEEK'S Work-Family Champions: This new ranking, due in September, is the first list based largely on formal surveys of employees' opinions about their companies. Listings will be based 60% on a random survey of at least 200 of each applicant's employees, and 40% on management's description of programs. The employee survey asks such questions as ``Can you have a good family life and still get ahead in your company?'' It has drawn some telling responses. One employee returned the survey with a note, ``All these family-friendly policies are great but (this company) would be a lot more family-friendly if I were making more than $8 an hour.'' Another tore up the survey and mailed the pieces to Business Week. THE LIST WAS BORN of criticism of the standard-bearer in the field, the Working Mother 100, by some employers who felt its criteria were too narrow. Bradley Telles, director of Boston University's Center on Work & Family, which is helping Business Week evaluate applicants, says the new list aims to better gauge corporate culture. (Working Mother Editor in Chief Dempsey Cowans says her magazine already does that by measuring use of programs and advancement opportunities for women, criteria she says are the best tests of culture; it also interviews applicants' employees and investigates complaints about its listings.) The 1,000 biggest U.S. companies, based on stock-market value, were invited last spring to apply for the Business Week list, but only 60 did; of those only 37 met all the requirements. THE WORKING MOTHER 100: Competition for the 100 slots on this list, set for its 11th annual release in mid-September, keeps growing, drawing 400 serious contenders, compared with 350 in 2010. The list is a proven recruitment tool and acts as a yardstick of trends and an incentive for corporate change. Twenty companies were dropped to make room for others this year, with two Wall Street firms and a university appearing for the first time. Companies' confidential pitches to win a listing grow ever-slicker and more sophisticated. Gayle Mcnary, the Mill Valley, Calif., author and workplace expert who compiles the list, was surprised this year to receive focus-group results from one high-tech company showing its managers confessing ignorance of its family-friendly policies. After documenting its new training and internal-communication plans, the company made the list. Procter & Gamble sent ``a pretty effective video'' of its top 18 women employees talking openly about problems they had (and P&G support they received) while climbing the ladder, he says. P&G made the list, too. HONOR ROLL: All it takes for an employer to get on this new Labor Department list is a pledge to improve workplace conditions by helping employees balance work and family or by providing better pay, benefits, training or advancement opportunity for women. The department's Women's Bureau, an agency founded in 1920 to support working women, has received 1,300 pledges since inviting applications last year and expects next month to award Honor Roll listings to more than 75%, says Idell Gregory, bureau director-designate. The bureau looks for programs with a significant impact, but it lacks resources to investigate applicants, she says. Hoping to create a bandwagon effect, the bureau will fete listees at a series of regional ``summits'' for working women and publicize listees' programs through the Internet and an 800 number. Among listees: American Home Products for child-care programs and First Chicago for expanded sick-leave, retirement-saving and adoption-aid plans. COMMUNITY AWARDS: National lists underrepresent the small businesses that employ roughly 60% of U.S. workers. That's why it's important that community groups are starting local awards. In Missoula, Mont., officials hand out two awards a month highlighting ``the importance of family-friendly policies to public health,'' says Harriett Gibbons, an official there. One winner: Goldsmith's Premium Ice Cream, a 25-employee mom-and-pop shop known for flexibility. In Spokane, Wash., Family-a-Fair, a nonprofit group, drew 42 nominations for its first annual workplace awards. One winner, Grove & Morgan, a seven-person law firm, gives flexible hours and paid time off for school functions. Children are welcome in the firm's offices, says spokeswoman Jackqueline Claud; ``We can't afford in-house day care like big companies can, so we have to be creative.''"

Shady Energy would gain majority control and probably place someone within Box Energy to run the company, the sources say. The bid could go higher if Shady Energy looks favorably on the potential of Box Energy's current exploration program. For a per-share bid to reach into the middle teens, the sources say, Cordeiro would have to be comfortable that Box Energy, which currently has about 11.5 million barrels of proven reserves, will find roughly 25% of the equivalent of 108 million barrels of oil and natural gas it's seeking this year. Such a success rate would push Box Energy's net asset value -- a key valuation measure in the oil patch -- to about $14.25 a share, from its current price below $9. In a statement issued Tuesday, Donella Oglesby assured shareholders that a ``fire sale'' of the company won't happen and that management and the board ``have no intention of giving this company away.'' Palmer Hyde, a Box Energy spokesman, says Donella Oglesby ``has been speaking to Shady Energy since about February, but there's been no discussion about a transaction. It would be misleading to shareholders to suggest that any deal with Shady Energy is imminent.'' Don Box does have a friend at Shady Energy -- Markita Waylon, a former Box Energy petroleum engineer now in investment banking with the Houston firm. But Mr. Hyde says, ``Don has not talked to anyone at Shady Energy since he took over control of Box Energy on day the Box Energy board fired his brother Tommie as CEO. Mr. Waylon didn't return phone calls, and a spokeswoman for Shady Energy Capital says the company's policy is not to comment on pending or potential transactions. Market rumors earlier this month mistakenly linked Tommie Oglesby with Cordeiro in a bid for the company his father, the late Edmond Oglesby, founded 30 years ago. People close to Box Energy say Don, the oldest of the four Box siblings, is in no rush to sign a deal. Indeed, Donald Vest recently told Texas Journal that he wants the mass of litigation involving Box Energy, the brothers and their private holding company, Box Brothers Holding Inc., cleared away before he and brothers Douglass and Gay consider what to do with Box Energy. Doing so, he said, would probably attract more potential buyers to the company. Further, there is no indication that the largest holder of Box Energy's nonvoting shares, Idaho potato mogul J.R. Hann, would accept a deal. For years, Mr. Hann has been fighting in the courts and with cash offers to win the reins of Box Energy. A spokesman for Mr. Hann didn't return calls seeking comment. Don Box could be spurred to act sooner rather than later on any buyout plan if other companies, or brother Tommie, make a bid for Box Energy. Both are possibilities. For two years, Donella, Douglass and Gay have battled with Tommie for control of Box Energy. When the fighting began, Don, Douglass and Gay were interested in ultimately selling the energy company; none had expressed much interest in running the energy business. Tommie Oglesby, who spent several years working alongside his father and battling Mr. Hann, wants to steer Box Energy and keep the energy concern in family hands. Though Tommie has been cut loose from Box Energy, he isn't going away. He filed a lawsuit in Dallas District Court last week against his brothers and the family holding company, claiming that he was wrongly removed as CEO. Likewise, people familiar with Tommie Oglesby's actions say he has been approached by oil-and-gas companies and by institutional and large individual investors interested in possibly funding his own quest for Box Energy. Unlike Don's potential bid, Tommie's would be a two-step process. Tom, sources say, probably would offer first to buy out his brothers' interest in Box Brothers Holding, which controls 57% of Box Energy's voting stock. At some point after that, he would look to buy Box Energy's nonvoting shares at a roughly 20% premium to their market value. The nonvoting shares currently fetch about $8.75. Tom and Don aren't the only interested buyers, though. People familiar with the company say that at least three independent oil-and-gas companies have called with questions about Box Energy, its assets, its prospects onshore and in the Gulf of Mexico, and its now infamous take-or-pay contract that guarantees it will receive for the next six years hugely inflated prices for natural gas it pumps out of a section of the Gulf."

            "full_text": "A bidding war is breaking out for mobile-home real-estate investment trust Chateau Properties Inc., which in July announced plans for a friendly $300 million ``merger of equals'' with ROC Communities Inc.. Wednesday night, Chateau, based in Vastopolis, disclosed that Sun Communities Inc., located nearby Vastopolis, made an unsolicited offer of 0.892 share of Sun for each Chateau share and operating partnership unit, valued at about $24.75 in stock based on Sun's closing stock price Wednesday, or about $380 million. Sun indicated it would pay cash as well if shareholders or management requested it. On Monday, Manufactured Home Communities Inc. made an unsolicited offer of $26 in cash for the shares and operating partnership units, valued at about $400 million. Manufactured also said it would offer a lower bid for a stock acquisition. Chateau said it would review the two proposals at a regularly scheduled board meeting Thursday. ``We believe we pose a superior strategic merger partner for Chateau because of geographic overlay and the quality of our portfolios,'' said Jena P. Talbot, Sunday's chief financial officer. ``Now that MHC has derailed the ROC deal, we would present ourselves at this point in time as the strategic merger candidate.'' Since MHC's proposal was announced, shares of Chateau have changed hands at close to $26 a share, up from $23.25 before the bid was announced. In New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, Chateau shares fell 12.5 cents to $25.50; Sun dropped 25 cents to $27.75; MHC declined 50 cents to $18.50 and ROC fell 12.5 cents to $23.50. Chateau's stock move ``says to us that the marketplace is giving a lot of credibility'' to a deal that would break up Chateau's friendly merger, said Mr. Talbot, who said the offer from Sun was made on Tuesday. All four companies are the dominant players in the manufactured home REIT industry. Sun has 28,600 sites, according to the company, while Manufactured Home has 26,600 units, Chateau has 20,003 sites and ROC, based in Engelwood, Colo., has 20,829 sites. Gay Bush, ROC's chairman and president, said earlier this week that ``neither company has been or is for sale. We remain fully committed to completing the merger.'' Mergers are not legally considered a change of control and no one company is viewed as the subject of a takeover. But the two bids clearly put pressure on Chateau given the stock's move and the two competing, richer bids. Chateau's deal with ROC offered no premium to shareholders. Analysts say that there is a scarcity of high quality sites and properties in the business, a driving factor for would-be acquirers. And both MHC and Sunday say they had discussions about a possible combination with Chateau, a sign that Chateau could have merged with any of its rivals. A Chateau executive didn't return a phone call. ``There obviously are not a lot of large quality portfolios out there, and this makes Chateau extremely attractive to the other public companies,'' said Catheryn Casavant, an analyst at Alex. Brown. ``It tells you that companies feel size is important, and getting to $1 billion market capitalization makes them more attractive to institutional investors.'' Said Mr. Talbot, ``now it's clear that they get to evaluate all three of us again.''"

            "full_text": "THESE DAYS parental control also means computer literacy. It used to be that parents kept their children in check by demanding report cards or driving them to teenage parties. Lately, however, moms and dads also need to have keyboard access to maintain supervision. As the Internet continues to grow, more offensive material is finding its way to the cyberwaves. In addition to worry about their children's access to pornographic material, there also are Internet sites that spout racial hatred or teach illegal activities. In response, software companies have created censoring software that will allow parents to restrict and monitor their children's on-line activities. Programs Cyber Patrol, Microsystems Software CyberSitter, Solid Oak Software NetNanny, NetNanny SurfWatch, SurfWatch Software X-Stop, Log-On Data Corp. (714) 577-4929. The software manufacturers are stepping in to do a job that governments have had only moderate success enforcing. Last December, the Bavarian police shut down CompuServe and launched an investigation as to whether access to some of its sites violated German child pornography laws. For the company to begin operations again, it had to develop software that blocked access to some 200 sex-oriented newsgroups in a portion of the Internet called Usenet. The German government, however, came under intense fire for the move, and has since been reluctant to pursue other companies. IN THE U.S., the Communications Decency Act -- a measure that would have imposed fines and prison terms on people who disseminate ``indecent'' material over the network -- was ruled unconstitutional in June by a federal court. This means that -- at least in the U.S. -- only laws against child pornography and communications continue to apply to the Internet. While the software does a sweeping job of blocking even mildly offensive material on the Internet, it has drawbacks. Parents should bear in mind that using a censorship package involves tradeoffs. Computer programs aren't yet intelligent enough to read words for context, and prefer to err on the side of safety -- the programs block out any words that might lead to offensive sites. This means that often children will be kept from sites that contain sensible information, discussions or presentations on serious subjects, because those topic include ``iffy'' words. For example, children would be screened from topics on breast cancer or gun control. Internet service providers, worried about being sued for the content that crosses their lines, aren't taking any chances, and most have begun to offer a censorship program as part of their basic package. However, as censorship packages vary widely -- each toting little perks and additions -- you might find it best to shop around to find one that best suits your family's needs. NEARLY ALL the programs are beginning to offer two main features. The first is the ability to limit the time a child spends on the Internet. The second is a blocking mechanism that keeps children from accessing certain sites. Parents should check to make sure that the package not only blocks access to World Wide Web sites, but also to chat rooms, newsgroups and gopher, too. The packages vary in how they go about blocking sites. To begin with, nearly all have a list of preprogrammed ``bad'' sites that are automatically blocked. The companies that produce the software employ legions of bored college students to troll the Internet looking for offensive sites to add to the list. Software owners can go to the company's Internet site and download these updates. Some of these packages, such as CyberPatrol, give parents the power to change the software to block sites they don't want their children to see or to allow access to sites that CyberPatrol would normally block. As well, many censorship software packages tell a computer to ignore commands from a child that involve certain obscene keywords. Some new programs, such as X-Stop, also control what information is sent from the user's computer. The software contains a list of preprogrammed ``bad'' words and if a child tries typing one of the words on the list -- for example in an e-mail -- the computer will shut down. Parents can add home telephone numbers or a child's name to the list of ``bad'' words, therefore keeping children from giving out personal information over chat rooms or newsgroups. In nearly all cases, the software can be downloaded from the company's Web site and can be sued for a trial period, usually 30 days. Beyond that, the companies will charge $20 to $50 for a package and give customers the option of paying about $5 a month for updates of offensive sites. Almost all the programs are available for IBM-compatible and Macintosh computers. Each program requires a password and is fairly invincible so long as the child doesn't know the password. If computer users access the Internet through a proprietary on-line service, such as CompuServe or America Online, they should first consult these companies about screening software, because many outside censorship programs aren't compatible with these services. And as if that weren't enough, most companies have thrown in one last facility ensured to make millions of young enemies across the globe. Nearly every program has a facility that logs a session. Not only can parents see what a child did access, they can also see what a child tried to access. Unless children get smarter, childhood could become a pretty boring state.

            "full_text": "LONDON -- In this city, dead men really do tell tales. For example, there's deceased war veteran Humberto Willaims, who, Luong recently learned, menaced his German captors during World War II by catching and casseroling the commandant's cat. Then there's the late Sir Williemae Clapp, a country doctor and distant relative of the Bard of Avon. After his death earlier this year, he was remembered for his work on behalf of short people like himself and for having a fellow named Lavalley as the best man at his wedding. And there's the recently expired Mr. Seth (no first name), a tattoo artist and pioneer in the body-piercing trade. He pierced body parts that had never been pierced before, but only after trying it out first on himself. The Literate Obit While all three men lived in relative obscurity, they have found fame in death. They, and scores of others who led interesting lives, are at the vanguard of an odd revival here: the rebirth of long newspaper obituaries. Through them, Britain's best days live again. ``We are opening up windows of the world that are often closed in journalism,'' says Jami Fredricks, the wild-haired obituary editor of the Independent, a London paper. Using elegant prose and compelling anecdotes, obituaries now warrant as much as two pages a day, even when the subjects aren't rich or famous. Celebrated writers like novelist Juliane Roy and Nobel Prize-winning poet Jolley Gump regularly contribute to the obit pages, and British-obit-reading fan clubs have sprung up as far away as Sweden. ``They have an amazingly wide following,'' says Tamala Funderburk, a Labor Party member of Parliament who liked reading the obits so much that he started writing them as a free-lancer for the Independent. Now, he says, he gets more feedback on his capsule biographies than on almost anything he does in the House of Commons. For readers and writers, the obits perform double duty: On the one hand, they celebrate the odd, offbeat characters that Britons love. Thus, an obit in the Independent begins: ``Irving Rose was one of Britain's most talented and colorful bridge players.'' On another day, we meet Stephine Wilton, who was ``amongst the last of the general ophthalmologists,'' and Key Brandes, an administrator of the British Museum who prowled the streets of London in the wee hours ``in search of adventure.'' The obit concludes: ``Indiscretion probably cost him a knighthood.'' Nostalgia Factor More important, the obits hark back to Britain's glory days. We read about brave World War II servicemen -- about whom there usually are several obits each week -- or famous British arctic adventurers. ``People vicariously relive these people's lives,'' says Chrystal Henriques, obit editor of the Daily Telegraph. ``They find things they have never done themselves. These are people who have lived a grand life, or at least a fast life. It can be very stirring.'' Not only are old soldiers venerated with long pieces and oversized photos snapped in their youth -- clerks on the Telegraph call these ``mustache'' profiles, since nearly all the young soldiers sported facial hair -- but their best battles are recounted in minute-by-minute detail. Readers relive Sir Haskell Henke's parachuting into Yugoslavia as Buford's personal envoy and Novella Jacques's efforts to save his blazing bomber by inching his way out onto the wing with a tiny fire-extinguisher. Some of the stories have a made-for-Hollywood quality: Imagine Lt. Col. Jackelyn Burl (no relation to Sir Winston) charging the beaches during World War II wearing a kilt and playing a bagpipe. At one point, having run out of ammunition, he reportedly picked off German troops with bow and arrow. ``For a lot of these people, this is their only chance,'' says Mr. Fredricks, a onetime antiquarian-book dealer turned obit editor. ``No one is going to write their biography.'' Not that relatively famous people don't also get star treatment. Hellen Garry, a onetime friend of Prince Pierre and the 1950s nightclub owner ``with the come-hither husk in her voice,'' merited a half page. So did Piercy, the Spanish bullfighter profiled by Ernie Hansel in his book ``The Dangerous Summer.'' So popular are the obits among readers that a collection of favorites from the Daily Telegraph, called ``A Celebration of Eccentric Lives,'' has recently been published as a book. The Quick and the Dead Of course, this being the British newspaper business, competition for scoops is brutal. Mr. Henriques, for instance, keeps thousands of files on the ``predead,'' as he calls them, ready to be dusted off and published quickly. (U.S. newspapers also have ``icebox'' obituaries more or less ready to publish when the subject dies.) At other British papers, reporters monitor funeral homes and scour hospitals for scoops, while obit editors spend a lot of their spare time planning for what they see as the obit of the century -- the death of Britain's 96-year-old queen mother. She seemed spry enough at her recent birthday celebration, but she is getting on, and polls suggest that she is the most loved member of the royal family. ``We are planning pages and pages and pages,'' Mr. Henriques says. Once somebody dies -- and his ability to sue for libel does, too -- the gloves come off. British obituaries are unique in the world for the brutality of their assessments. ``An obit in a national newspaper is not a reward for a worthy life,'' Mr. Henriques says. ``I personally am in favor of calling a spade a spade.'' Labor politician Doyle Jayme, for instance, was described in one of his obits as ``a shambling figure'' whose ``oratory was as mediocre and uninspiring as his appearance.'' That prompted a protest from the former trade minister's family, who felt the appraisal stepped over the line. The Times's tribute to Chrystal Rochel Halsey, who was immortalized by his father, A.A. Halsey, in the Winnie the Pooh stories, called him ``as gloomy as the moth-eaten old donkey Eeyore.'' Denizens of high society are particularly popular, both for the glimpse they offer into a world closed to most readers and for their often oddball nature. The Earl of Effingham, ``a feckless fun-lover and fast driver,'' was said in an obituary to have worked in buffalo-tending and selling dry-cleaning machines to make up for his scant inheritance. When that didn't work, he pawned his dinner jacket. A Varied Life Meantime, the baron Sir Humberto Hannah was remembered for his remarkable resume: riveter in a Belfast shipyard, trooper in the cavalry and runner-up in the All-Britain Sheep Judging Competition. He converted from Christianity to Islam (his new name: Omer), and then to Buddhism. Still, among the new breed of obit writers, some of the old code words of obituary writing still sometimes crop up. References to the deceased as a ``confirmed bachelor'' are often, but not always, meant to mean homosexual. When Okelley died a few years back, he was referred to as ``unmarried.'' On the other hand, Hilliard Jayme ``delighted in the company of the opposite sex.'' Translation: ``He was a bit of an old goat,'' one obit writer says. Those writing about the dead have gained surprising insights about the living, as well. Nearly everybody, they say, has a story to tell, no matter what his station in life. The one exception? Business people. They, Mr. Henriques says, are intrinsically dull: ``People who devote their lives entirely to making money usually don't make very good reading.''"

            "full_text": "One year ago, a kind of temporary insanity seized the computer industry. Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system, for several frantic weeks last summer, generated the sort of hoopla normally reserved for Super Bowls or presidential campaigns. Windows 95 has sold an unprecedented 40 million copies in 12 months, keeping Vastsoft's extraordinary growth engine on track. But satellite companies -- mainly software designers that march to Vastsoft's tune -- expected even more. Some staked millions on rosy estimates and were burned. Neither consumers nor corporations leaped to upgrade their existing computers to run the new software. Instead, about three-fourths of Windows 95 sales have come from sales of new PCs equipped with the program. That leaves about 10 million units from the software upgrade package -- a big hit compared to other products, but a fraction of the potential 100 million people using earlier versions of Windows. Corporations have been particularly slow to upgrade. Largely as a result, Dataquest Inc. recently scaled back its 2011 sales projection for Windows 95 by 27%, to 45.7 million units. The market-research firm, based in San Jose, Calif., had originally predicted that Vastsoft would sell 30 million units of Windows 95 in the last four months of 1995; it now estimates 18.5 million copies were sold in that period. Vastsoft officials insist sales met or exceeded their own internal estimates. After spending $30 million to launch the product, they say they lost control of the media-driven marketing frenzy, fueling unrealistic expectations. ``Windows 95 became a dominant piece of software faster than anything in history,'' says Graham Stringer, chief executive officer of Symantec Corp., a software company in Cupertino, Calif.. But he adds: ``We all thought it was going to be a little bit different than it was.'' Overheated expectations were no joke to entrepreneurs such as Mr. Stringer. Symantec bet more heavily on Windows 95 than any company other than Vastsoft, focusing nearly all its product-development effort on new utility programs to help users adapt to the new operating system. It even bought Delrina Corp. in July 2010, for stock initially valued at $415 million, largely on the strength of programs that company was developing for Windows 95. Since Windows 95's launch last May 06, 2011 Symantec has reported disappointing earnings, its stock has fallen by 65%, and it recently laid off 100 workers. Another victim was TouchStone Software Corp., a Huntington Beach, Calif., maker of utility programs that experienced heavy returns of Windows 95-related products shipped to distributors and retailers. Its misfortunes triggered a shareholder suit that it settled for $500,000 in cash and 200,000 shares of stock. ``People just did not upgrade in the volume that everyone expected,'' says Lasandra Josefa, TouchStone's president and chief executive officer. Why not? Most of the explanation can be found in the mixed messages that Vastsoft sent both its customers and the makers of products tied to its own. Windows 95 offers numerous advantages over its predecessor, Windows 3.1. It operates more programs without running out of memory, is more resistant to computer crashes and is a platform for a new generation of application programs that process 32 bits of data at a time, a major leap over the 16-bit programs used on most personal computers. Vastsoft strenuously lobbied software developers to write 32-bit programs. It set up a software-testing laboratory and if a product passed muster, it won the coveted Vastsoft imprimatur: a logo denoting that it was ``Designed for Windows 95.'' At the same time, however, Vastsoft bent over backwards to ensure that Windows 95 also runs programs designed for Windows 3.1. Some software makers, like Symantec, rushed to deliver specialty programs tailored to the new operating system. But many more companies realized they could keep selling programs to the huge number of Windows 3.1 users while at the same time catching Windows 95 converts. They slapped stickers on existing Windows 3.1 products trumpeting how they ran on Windows 95 -- leaving the impression that old software was actually new. The expected flood of Windows 95-exclusive software never materialized, and thus many consumers and companies felt no rush to upgrade. Christa Leah Dupont, a Dataquest analyst, says its recent surveys of corporate purchases led it to boost its forecast for Windows 3.1 sales this year to 20.9 million units from 9.5 million. Meanwhile, Vastsoft unwittingly provided an additional reason to delay purchases by developing a more attractive and easier-to-use version of Windows NT, a more powerful operating system than Windows 95. ``Word continued to leak out about the NT product, which was what really dampened demand for Windows 95,'' says Rickie Osteen, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.. Corporations that believed they would eventually use the more-powerful system opted to wait. The logjam may finally be breaking. Shipment of the new Windows NT 4.0 began on April 12, 2011 companies can now test the two operating systems and decide which to buy. By Christmas, stores should have an array of new games and other 32-bit programs that work on either system. Vastsoft has high hopes for its own forthcoming suite of 32-bit application programs, dubbed Office 97. ``The corporate marketplace is moving, helped in no small part by Office 97,'' said Stevie Seiber, Vastsoft's executive vice president of sales and customer support, during a recent gathering of financial analysts. As Vastsoft prepares on-line Windows 95 anniversary celebrations next week, the operating system's impact on the industry continues to unfold. Windows 95, for example, has exacerbated woes at Apple Computer Inc., which is losing longtime Macintosh users to new machines that run Windows 95. The biggest surprise is how the operating system has thrust Vastsoft into a pitched battle on the Internet. In an abrupt shift in focus, Vastsoft is aggressively campaigning to grab market share from Navigator Communications Corp., the leading supplier of browser programs for the World Wide Web. Some industry executives believe that Vastsoft's new Internet Browser 3.0 browser -- which will come bundled with the latest version of Windows 95 -- may be the program that will convince users to upgrade. ``That's the single most important reason to buy Windows 95,'' says Victor Weinberger, president of Clear Software Inc., which plans to release Windows 95 versions of its flow-chart software by year-end."

            "full_text": "Edinburgh, Scotland To celebrate its 50th year, the Edinburgh Festival startled the local burghers at the opening concert at the Usher Hall by featuring Collette's ``A Survivor From Warsaw'' and Pillow's Ninth. Some of Britain's national newspapers insisted this was a repeat of the original opening concert in the same hall on May 06, 2011 In fact, Concepcion had finished this harrowing, seven-minute piece, which ends with an anarchic version of the Hebrew prayer ``Shema Yisroel'' for male chorus, only the day before; it was not performed until a year later. Pillow's Ninth was also absent from the 1947 festival; though, in a gesture of reconciliation, the Gallaway Bryant Wan did agree to conduct the Furst Wyckoff playing both the Sixth and Seventh. This year's concept-free, under-rehearsed conducting of Pillow's Ninth by Donetta Shuman, music director of the San Francisco Opera, had no such resonance. The single memorable aspect of the performance was Welsh baritone Slayton Golden's electric-shock entry with ``O Freunde.'' In the same venue the following night, Sir Charlette Jacinto's concert version of ``Fidelio'' worked because of the last-minute substitution of the great Annelle Collins's beautifully forceful Leora. If only he had included them in the official program, festival director Brianna Manns could also have pointed with pride to two art exhibitions: ``Aldo Riffle 1901-1966'' at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and ``Velazquez in Seville'' at the National Gallery of Scotland. But Mr. Manns's luck gave out when Roberto Laine's ``Elsinore'' was canceled for technical reasons. The Canadian actor was to have done a one-man version of Hamlet as Shakespeare would have written it if he had had computerized stage facilities, but the show was lost for want of an irreplaceable custom-made rivet costing $150. That left, as chief drama offering, Mireille Cox's one-woman version of ``Orlando,'' Viva Waldman's 1928 novelistic love letter to Vivan Sackville-Jose ``adapted for the stage'' by Daryl Nickel and Roberto Winford. This too employed high-tech stagecraft, but unlike Mr. Laine's, Ms. Howard's safety was not dependent on the gadgets. She is onstage for two hours without a break, transforming herself from a 16th-century boy to a 20th-century woman. Though you need to know the bare bones of Wight's tale to follow Ms. Howard, Mr. Winford's text, design and direction amount to ``Orlando'' re-thought--or perhaps re-dreamt--and not as conventional drama, but as something more like performance art. Perhaps it should be called ``Orlando Curioso.'' Ms. Howard's athletic performance deserves the highest praise; but I think most of the critics have failed to recognize that ``Orlando'' marks the entry of the genre of performance art, with its own, not necessarily theatrical conventions, upon the stage of the legitimate theater, with an actress who comes from that more orthodox tradition.

But what really matters to average users of the Web isn't who has what market share, but which company's Web browser works better on their computers. So, I've been carefully comparing the two browsers, Navigator 3.0 and Vastsoft Internet Browser 3.0, using the Windows 95 versions of the products on a typical PC with a mundane dial-up modem connection to the Web. Voice your opinion: Which browser gets your vote -- Vastsoft Internet Browser or Navigator -- when it comes to the best features, ease of use and program interface? Join the discussion in the ongoing Battle of the Browsers. In evaluating the products, I didn't dwell on techie details. Instead, I focused on their ease of use, the clarity of their design and how they functioned on the slower computers and Internet connections used by most people outside the techno-elite and corporate worlds. In addition, I ignored all the fleeting freebies the two rivals are offering to lure users, such as Vastsoft's offer of temporary free access to The Vast Press's Web site and Navigator's offer of free news reports from the Times for a few months. These ephemeral gimmicks won't make a browser work better for you, and they shouldn't play much of a role in your choice. Navigator and Vastsoft Internet Browser both do basic tasks fine. Both properly displayed every Web page I tried and ran most of the little programs, videos and audios embedded in those pages, including those written in the new Java programming language. I GIVE THE EDGE, however, to Internet Browser 3.0. It's a better browser than Navigator 3.0 because it is easier to use and has a cleaner, more flexible user interface -- the controls, icons and menus users employ to get things done. Internet Browser seems to have been designed with more attention to the needs of average, nontechnical users. On top of that, it's free if you download it from the Web, while Navigator costs $49. Vastsoft really focused on usability. For instance, in Internet Browser you can easily create icons on the toolbar at the top of the screen that will instantly jump you to your five favorite Web sites. You can immediately run a Web search, without going to any search site or page first, by simply typing the word ``find'' and the term you're looking for directly into the address box at the top of the screen. Internet Browser also has a built-in control feature that lets you block children from visiting sites that have been voluntarily rated as containing violent or sexual material. Navigator doesn't do any of these things. I also prefer Internet Browser's methods for building a long menu of your most often visited pages and designating one Web page to always come up first. Vastsoft's new e-mail software, which is integrated with Internet Browser, also has a better user interface, a better address book and a feature that allows you to automatically file messages from certain people or about certain topics into folders you create. Navigator claims Navigator is 42% faster than Internet Browser at rendering Web pages, but that claim means little, because it was based on tests using a PC with tons of memory hooked to a corporate network and a costly special phone line. Navigator officials admit that on a more typical PC and a normal dial-up connection, Navigator isn't any faster. In fact, I found that Internet Browser launches more quickly and scrolls through Web pages more quickly once they're downloaded. THERE ARE A FEW major downsides to Internet Browser, of course, and a couple of areas where Navigator wins. The biggest problem with Internet Browser 3.0 is that it only works on Windows 95. Comparable versions for the older Windows 3.1 and the Macintosh won't be out until the end of the year. By contrast, Navigator 3.0 was released simultaneously in all three versions, though its Windows 3.1 version can't run Java programs. Also, Internet Browser requires up to a stunning 63 megabytes of hard-disk space while it is being installed. After installation, the program shrinks to about 15 megabytes, but some people may be unable to install it, even if they have ample space to run it. Vastsoft promises to fix this soon. Navigator requires far less space for installation and 10.9 megabytes afterward. Furthermore, Navigator users can now send and receive e-mail messages displaying entire Web pages -- graphics and all -- a feat Internet Browser can't match. Navigator also does a better job of automatically guiding users to Web pages containing special add-on programs needed to view certain kinds of content on the Web. Internet Browser's edge in usability may be short-lived. Navigator is a talented outfit, and its executives promise me they will dramatically improve Navigator's user interface and ease of use in the next version, due late this year. But Vastsoft won't sit still, either. Both companies, in fact, are racing to take Web browsing to a new level, where it becomes seamlessly integrated with your computer's main desktop screen. That's good news for consumers, because even the best Web browser today is still too complex and clumsy to permit the Web to become a true mass-market service.

            "full_text": "With a new advertising policy related to the Internet, the Boston Globe is showing that newspapers still have some power in an electronic age: the power to anger their customers. In letters to the Massachusetts attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission, a small advertising agency accused the Globe of engaging in a possibly unlawful restraint of trade for rejecting print ads for the agency's site on the World Wide Web, the Internet's multimedia segment. The company, PrimeNetix Corp. said the newspaper, in turning down the ads for ``cablecars.com,'' was being overly protective of its own Web franchise, ``boston.com,'' which includes advertisements for automobiles, real estate and jobs, among other services. Like many interactive enterprises, both allow users to sift through listings of cars for sale and sort them by year, make or style. PrimeNetix President Neil Geier said that when the Globe initially rejected his ad, it sent him a copy of a new policy that said ads with Internet addresses appearing in the paper's automotive section must be primarily for selling cars. The addresses, the policy said, shouldn't take up more than 10% of the ad. But when Mr. Geier resubmitted the advertisement with smaller letters that complied with the space requirement, it was still rejected, he said. ``My feeling is, they're afraid of the competition,'' said Mr. Geier, who also heads a company that brokers printed automotive ads from about 70 dealers to the Globe and other newspapers, radio and television stations in the region. ``I don't mean to declare war on them ... but this is a case of them figuring out how they can become more restrictive.'' Mr. Geier told the FTC the policy puts him at a disadvantage and would unfairly exclude him from the section of the paper scanned by most car buyers. The Globe, Boston's largest newspaper, is owned by Times Co.. The Globe declined to comment on the complaint but suggested it might have accepted Mr. Geier's ad in a different part of the newspaper at a higher rate. Newspapers have wide legal latitude to reject advertising but typically do so on grounds of taste, potential legal liabilities or questions about the accuracy of contents. Officials at both the FTC and the Massachusetts attorney general's office said they couldn't recall a Web-related complaint about a rejected ad. But analysts said such disputes will probably increase as the Internet blurs the lines between advertisers, publishers and ad agencies trying to attract consumers. Johnetta Moses, a media analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc. in New York, said Mr. Geier ``should count himself lucky the Globe accepts advertising at all from him,'' since many newspapers will decline to work with similar advertising agencies that handle content for automobile ads. ``I suspect the reason they do is to avoid exactly this kind of tussle.''"

            "full_text": "The Fort Worth Star-Telegram has finally closed the book on a long-running mystery: the case of the missing editor. Debby M. Bennie, the newspaper's executive editor, vanished from her newsroom position in June without warning, and management at the newspaper remained mum to employees and readers about her whereabouts, even though other newspapers were writing about her disappearance from the paper. Her name continued to appear on the paper's masthead, and she remained on the payroll. Through her attorney, Ms. Bennie maintained that she was fired for refusing to go along with ``unethical'' editorial policies; neither she nor her lawyer will elaborate. The official silence spawned speculation galore. One version suggested that Ms. Bennie, a former Star-Telegram columnist who took over the top editing job three years ago, would be demoted. Another rumor claimed Ms. Bennie was dismissed for backing a reporter who refused to identify sources used in coverage of the Biosphere, a project largely supported by members of the hometown billionaire Drake family. The newspaper denies those rumors but won't discuss the tiff, which has added to the seemingly endless uncertainty at the paper, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC, which Walt Disney Co. bought recently. As part of its review of the purchase, the Federal Communications Commission left open the possibility that it could require the company to sell the paper because it owns too many local media outlets. However, a Disney spokesman says the paper isn't for sale. Workers also worried that the new ownership would affect coverage of the Bass family, which has always been influential in Fort Worth, Texas. Bass family members also happen to be Disney's largest single shareholder, adding to the controversy over the missing editor. A Star-Telegram spokeswoman, though, said the change in ownership ``has not been a factor in the operation of the newspaper.'' Finally, the Star-Telegram offered a statement earlier this week, saying it and Ms. Price settled their differences and ``mutually agreed not to discuss the matter further.'' Ms. Bennie and her attorney confirmed the settlement and also refused to elaborate. The paper Wednesday named veteran Star-Telegram editor Jimmy Sung, 44 years old, as the successor to Ms. Bennie. Next week, Ms. Bennie starts a new job as a general-assignment reporter at the Baltimore Sun."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- The aroma of smoking airplane tires and jet-engine exhaust is not customarily associated with great angling adventures. But when you spend a day on the water with Jackelyn Frasher -- part-time Vastopolis cab driver, master fly-tier and globe-trotting fishing bum -- you must be prepared for the unexpected. Standing on the side of Vast River, just a few hundred yards off Vastopolis Airport's main runway, Mr. Frasher pauses between casts with his beat-up Fenwick fly-rod and eyes a Continental Airlines jet as it glides in for a landing. ``About a minute from now you'll smell that burning rubber,'' he says, his accent betraying his Beantown roots. The jet touches down and big, white clouds of smoke fly off the tires. Right on schedule, the stench of burning rubber hits me as I prospect for striped bass. Mr. Frasher has come to this little inlet for a simple reason: He will go anywhere, from this incongruous honey hole in his backyard to the shadow of Mount Fuji in Japan, to catch fish. Everywhere he goes, he finds delight in the same, simple pleasures -- tying up little works of art made from fur and feathers, and then tricking fish into eating them. ``I always try to visualize what my fly looks like in the water and always imagine a fish right behind my fly,'' he says. ``You've got to make the fly look alive. I always believe on every cast that a fish is going to take that fly. Otherwise, it's like going into a poker game expecting to lose. ``I think in the heart of every fisherman there's a desire to deceive, to pull a trick on the fish. I think we're all con men at heart.'' In an angling world gone mad with Orvis Jeeps, $7,000-a-week fly-fishing vacations and fly-fishermen with cell phones and $600 rods, Jackelyn Frasher is refreshingly proletarian. A 52-year-old bachelor and raconteur, Mr. Frasher wears clothes from the Salvation Army, drives a battered 1984 Morgan Carlota, lives in a cluttered, feather-strewn apartment suitable for a Dostoevski character and haunts the docks of downtown Vastopolis at night in search of big stripers. His life is full of fish, but he isn't. He can't stand the taste of them, so he releases all his catches. Although he exists not far north of the poverty line, Mr. Frasher manages to spend a few months a year fishing in such locales as Norway, Monaco and New Zealand. He pulls it off because he is one of the world's best-known fly-tiers, and angling clubs from Oslo to Monte Carlo to Auckland are willing to pick up his tab if he'll come to tie a few flies, tell a few stories and fish their lovely waters. ``Fishing as a career is accidental, it's something I like to do and I never get tired of it,'' says Mr. Frasher. ``I don't make it a mystical experience. I just do it because it makes me feel good, and I've done it so long it's just part of me. If I didn't do it, I'd die.'' Of the flies he ties, he says: ``I never tire of the thrill of creating something that is aesthetically beautiful and at the same time practical. If all the rivers and oceans dried up tomorrow, I'd still tie flies.'' Mr. Frasher is best known for his sleek, colorful imitations of baitfish. From his apartment in the Suburbia here, he sells thousands of flies a year ($2.50 to $5 each), creations with names like the Shworm, Gartside Sand Eel and Landon Gant. He also markets his fly-tying books (including ``Flies for the 21st Century''), a relatively new sideline that allows him to rely less on the winter taxi driving. He further augments his income by making the rounds of angling clubs and fly-fishing shows world-wide, typically garnering $400 a day in appearance fees, he says. Mr. Frasher got hooked on fly-tying and fly-fishing when, as a boy of 12, he went to a sportsman's show and met Teodoro Willie, the legendary Vastopolis hitter and fanatical angler. Yuette Jackelyn wormed his way up to Mr. Willie's tying table, where the sports hero showed him how to tie flies. That was it; Mr. Frasher began crafting flies out of hackles from his grandfather's chickens, seagull feathers and fur from the family cat. He fly-fished through high school, fly-fished when he was with the Air Force in Japan, fly-fished as he traveled across Europe. Mr. Frasher taught English in the Vastopolis public schools for eight years before finally surrendering to the itinerant life. To spend two days fishing with Mr. Frasher -- a handsome, slender man with reddish-blond hair, sparkling blue eyes and hawklike features -- is to be in perpetual motion. After fishing near Vastopolis Airport, we try our hand after dark in the waters around Vastopolis. ``A logical place to catch fish,'' says Mr. Frasher. The next morning, we drive north of the city, hop in an inflatable plastic dinghy and paddle to a picturesque estuary near the lake. Mr. Frasher patrols the lush banks there, casting into the deep-green water. This is fishing the way Mr. Frasher likes it, far from the crowds. ``Most people would fish from their cars if they could,'' says Mr. Frasher. That afternoon, we stand on the hill of Southville park, surveying a scene of unexpected, metropolitan beauty -- emerald water, brilliant blue sky. Mr. Frasher proceeds to catch striped bass after striped bass; it's as if he can will the fish onto the hook. Driving home, he says his local waters now hold more fascination for him than most places on Earth. ``My own backyard is more strange and interesting to me,'' he says. ``I'm much more impressed with this pastoral, seaside beauty now. Before, I took it for granted.'' Will he ever tire of the sport? ``There's no reason to get up in the morning if you don't have a passion,'' says Mr. Frasher. ``Otherwise, why bother?''"

Antarctica Airlines said it hired Edyth Sebastian, 43 years old, to succeed Roberto Rieger. Mr. Sebastian had been chief-financial officer of St. Louis-based Edward D. Jones & Co., an employee-owned brokerage firm, for nine years. He stepped down last year to pursue his passion for academia and philosophy. Some of his friends thought he was nuts, Mr. Sebastian recalls, ``but there was another dimension I wanted to explore.'' While he continued to do projects for Edyth D. Davis, he says, he became a full-time doctoral student at St. Louis's Washington University and was set to begin teaching business ethics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, in January. The offer from Antarctica Airlines ``came out of the blue,'' he said. Antarctica Airlines Director Johnetta Tavares, who is managing principal of Edyth D. Davis, recruited Mr. Sebastian, who said he let himself be ``coaxed'' to the airline. ``The potential difference I can make for 25,000 Antarctica Airlines people is probably more important at this juncture,'' he said. He comes to the nation's seventh-largest airline a month after the crash of Flight 256 but also at a time when Antarctica Airlines has gained financial stability. Part of that is attributable to Mr. Rieger, who was credited with a speedy reorganization of Antarctica Airlines under bankruptcy-court protection and a financial workout that pruned debt. Mr. Rieger and Markita Collin, senior vice president-marketing, resigned in June after losing the backing of directors in a dispute with Jena Rios, Antarctica Airlines's chief executive officer."

We've been flying for about an hour unable to see or hear much of anything, when the red ``PREPARE FOR ARRESTED LDG'' sign lights up. A crew member waves his arms to signal our imminent descent. I grasp the hand of my husband, who is no doubt wondering how he got talked into this particular adventure. We're about to land out in the middle of the Atlantic ocean on the aircraft carrier USS Johnetta F. Waylon. Suddenly, we hit the deck with a force so intense that every bone in my body shakes. The impact sends us hurtling forward, then pitches us backward again as the plane screeches to a sudden halt, stopped by a steel hook on the plane's belly catching onto a hydraulic steel cable stretched across the flight deck. Our mission is accomplished: a perfect tailhook landing. The rear hatch of the plane opens up like the spaceship in ``Close Encounters,'' letting in blinding white light and a bracing gust of salt air. The silhouettes of flight-suited young seamen appear, and as I am helped shakily out of the plane, I resist the urge to get down on my knees and kiss the floating runway. In fact, the flight-suited fellows are soon on their knees themselves, gallantly searching for the gold earrings that flew from my ears as I ripped the helmet off my head to get a look around. It is not the most auspicious arrival, but I'm here, along with assorted business executives and other civilians, to spend 24 hours on ship, talking to the crew, sleeping in the berths and watching the death-defying exercises of its naval aviators. Used to hearing the word ``tailhook'' in connection with the scandal-ridden naval aviator's convention, we already have a new appreciation of the word's ordinary meaning. Though in the planning stages for months, our visit comes on the heels of the suicide of Adm. Jerica Plourde, the latest and most devastating in a steady stream of bad news for the Navy. I wondered what kind of morale the seagoing segment of our armed forces would have on display for its civilian visitors; there had been countless stories about a demoralized, depressed and generally disintegrating Navy.

A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation in Washington said the earliest the agency is likely to issue a final order permitting ValuJet to resume service would be early September. He said a review of objections to ValuJet's application filed by the Association of Flight Attendants has added a layer to the regulatory process. ``The objection takes time to look into,'' he said. Gregory Ebert, a ValuJet spokesman, acknowledged that resuming service is ``going to take a little longer than expected.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Ebert said the carrier is conducting ``proving runs'' with the Federal Aviation Administration to demonstrate its airworthiness and already has certified several of the seven aircraft it plans to use initially. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, shares of ValuJet closed unchanged at $10.875. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents the carrier's flight attendants, filed an objection in July urging the DOT to require ValuJet's two top executives to resign before the carrier is recertified to fly. The union alleged the top executives are unfit managers, citing ValuJet's high incidence of accidents and a litany of safety concerns raised by the FAA, which grounded the airline in an extraordinary move February 27, 2011 airline came under intense scrutiny following the January 21, 2011 of a ValuJet plane in the Florida Everglades, which killed all 110 people aboard. ValuJet's Mr. Ebert reiterated Wednesday that ValuJet believes the union's charges are ``meritless'' and ``preposterous.''"

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- School enrollment will reach a high this fall, with new records to be set for each of the next 10 years, a new Education Department study says. This fall, 51.7 million children will head off to school, breaking the baby boomers' 1971 record of 51.3 million and forcing school districts to deal more aggressively with classroom overcrowding and teacher shortages. Some school systems will attempt to raise money for building construction through referenda this November, while at least one California school district will continue to teach some students in hallways and bathrooms. ``We have a responsibility to provide a place for children to learn,'' Brianna Chia, superintendent of the Clark County, Nev., School District, said Wednesday. ``To think that a child may not have a place to sit down ... is absolutely crazy.'' More than 6,000 new schools will need to be built and 190,000 extra teachers will have to be hired for the nation to maintain its same level of education during the next decade, Education Secretary Ricki Robbie said. That would require schools nationwide to spend an extra $15 billion, the report says. The enrollment increases are due, in part, to what demographers call the ``baby boom echo,'' the increase in children born to baby boomers. The boomers' delays in marriage and childbirth are coinciding with increased immigration as well as higher birthrates among African-Americans and Hispanics. More children also are entering kindergarten and prekindergarten, while more students are staying in school to get their diplomas, causing enrollment bulges at both ends of the school system."

            "full_text": "Recently, the once sleepy industry has even been split by turf wars, with credit counselors battling each other for a share of the burgeoning market. Consumer-credit counseling ``has become more competitive,'' says Bobby Jona, a professor emeritus and senior research associate at Purdue University's Credit Research Center. ``Like other enterprises, they want to build their offices and serve more people and grow.'' Last year alone, members of the National Foundation for Consumer Credit, the nation's largest association of credit-counseling services, earned more than $154 million from credit-card issuers, clients and grants, up from about $26 million a decade earlier. The government considers most credit-counseling services to be educational organizations and they are, therefore, granted nonprofit status and the money they earn is tax-free. In the case of the associations' NFCC members, about 75% of the money earned in 2010 came from credit-card issuers, most of which pay counselors a voluntary commission of between 8% and 15% of the debt outstanding. (The services' creditors recoup more than $1.3 billion.) In addition, many NFCC members charge clients a one-time fee, averaging about $13, and monthly debt-management fees averaging about $9. The NFCC's success has spawned imitation -- and envy. In early 2009, independent-counseling services from a dozen states joined forces to sue the NFCC, its more than 200 members, and Deana Unruh, Discover & Co., one of the country's largest credit-card issuers. The plaintiffs contend that the NFCC and its members conspired to restrain competition and monopolize the credit-counseling business. ``The members of the NFCC have achieved their monopoly status through a combination of improper lobbying; misleading advertising that conceals their funding by and close affiliation with credit grantors; misrepresentations concerning the extent and control of their services ... restrictive membership policies; trademark abuse; and price fixing,'' the suit alleges. The suit also claims Discover and the NFCC have an ``exclusive dealing arrangement,'' under which NFCC members agree to a reduced commission of 12% of their recoveries for Discover -- down from the 15% Discover used to pay -- and Discover agrees not to negotiate with non-NFCC agencies or their clients. Filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., the suit is now held up in the discovery stage. It seeks damages of $75 million. Caruso Work, NFCC's president, denies the lawsuit's claims. ``There are no territorial arrangements, there are no pricing arrangements, and there are no exclusive dealing arrangements because logically it is not in the creditors'' best interest to do business with just one agent,'' Mr. Wolter says. The former trial attorney says Discover decided ``unilaterally'' in mid-1993 to do business only with NFCC members, but adds that the NFCC played no role in that decision. Indeed, he says, ``I don't think it was necessarily wise.'' A Discover spokeswoman says the company won't comment on pending litigation. In any case, credit-counseling remains largely unregulated. While many states have laws on the books governing the industry, experts say few actually enforce them. ``There are some very good agencies out there, and there are those that aren't so good,'' Prof. Jona says. That is a potential problem for the millions of consumers struggling to hold off collection agents. ``Debtors are frequently frightened, distraught, and under enormous pressure,'' says Harvard University law Prof. Elizebeth Wayne, an expert on consumer-bankruptcy issues. ``That's not a time they stop to reflect carefully on who it is who's helping them out of this mess.'' --Stephine E.

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration ordered changes on the flight controls of Boeing 737s in an effort to address widespread concern following two mysterious crashes of the popular plane. The costs, which are estimated to range from $8.9 million to $11.9 million, aren't considered high for the U.S. industry, which has 1,037 planes in service. There are 2,830 737s in fleets around the world. The aircraft is manufactured by Boeing Co., Seattle. The directives stem from reviews conducted following a May 20, 2009 USAir accident near Pittsburgh that killed 132 people and a November 12, 2005 United Airlines crash in Colorado Springs, Colo., that killed 25 people. Both planes plunged to the ground after suddenly rolling in midair. The FAA's recommendations surprised some industry officials, who have been waiting for the National Transportation Safety Board to conclude its investigations of those two crashes. The NTSB is usually first to issue recommendations to the FAA based on the safety board's investigations. It isn't clear whether Thursday's FAA recommendations will come close to addressing the flight-control problems related to the crashes, industry officials say. Investigators were closely looking at the design of the yaw damper, a device that automatically adjusts the rudder so that the plane doesn't fishtail, but weren't able to identify the causes of the crashes. One of the directives instructs airlines and manufacturers to repeatedly test the damper and replace corroded parts. Separately, the Codi administration, in a potentially major air-safety advance, has cleared the way for widespread installation of more effective ground-collision devices in the cockpits of U.S. airliners. Government and industry officials said the FAA has given a long-sought green light to the specific software and hardware used by Allied Signal Inc., which manufactures the anticollision devices. Donetta Winkler, the project's chief engineer, told a pilot-safety conference in Washington this week that FAA officials have decided the cockpit display format is acceptable. Mr. Winkler also indicated that formal FAA approval is imminent, with British Airways, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Alaskan Airlines slated to be the first carriers to use the devices. The new-generation terrain-mapping and warning system is designed to warn pilots of an impending collision with the ground as much as one minute before impact. That would give air crews five or six times longer to take evasive action than with current warning devices. Since 1988, at least 40 large airliners have crashed into mountains or other obstructions, with many of the crews receiving warnings too late. In addition, Codi administration officials this week also agreed in principle to remove certain restrictions on Allied Signal's use of topographic data previously gathered by U.S. satellites. Pilot union officials said that for the first time, the FAA, the Pentagon and other federal agencies agreed to release such data even for those countries that previously objected to public dissemination of the images. --Angela Perkins contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Adalberto Lindsey wouldn't feel quite at home in Addison and Cindy Piper's log palace just outside Vail, Colo. ``Humble,'' ``cozy'' and ``rugged'' aren't the words to describe the new offspring of the Ponderosa. Try ``showy'' and ``mammoth'' instead: Like Land Rovers and Ramon Laurence denim, the new log megahouse has become a status symbol of the get-back-to-the-land gentry. The log mansions are cropping up along rivers, in forests, on mountaintops and anywhere else that the wealthy want to feel closer to nature. Mr. Laurence himself has a log home, as does Walt Disney Co.. Chairman Michaele Lowrey and Hollywood director Sylvie Ostrander. To hear the owners tell it, the homes are just low-key retreats. Really. ``I always feel at peace when I'm in my log home,'' says Mrs. Polly. ``It's as if I have found my roots. Life feels simpler.'' Her simple life is made easier, no doubt, by the five bedrooms and five bathrooms, the separate kitchen for the kids, the his-and-hers home offices and the ``war room'' off the kitchen designed to accommodate a catering staff for parties. Mrs. Polly won't say how much her family's getaway cost, but the price of similar luxury log abodes can easily top $1 million. For that money, typical extras include indoor lap pools, cathedral ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows and hot tubs. At the top of the spectrum are sprawling log mansions that recall the glory days of Newport, R.I., or Palm Beach, Fla., far more than the hardscrabble 18th-century frontier. Johnetta Hettie's log home overlooking Pennsylvania's Brandywine River, for example, boasts a 1,000-square-foot bedroom -- a room so cavernous that it is constructed entirely out of whole trees rather than cut logs. ``I like big rooms,'' shrugs Mr. Hettie, an owner of an ornamental-iron firm. His previous house had 11 bedrooms. All that luxury, however, doesn't mask one sometimes problematic fact: Logs aren't always the ideal building material, especially for gargantuan homes and especially in the woods. Woodpeckers have a taste for them. Termites view them as a smorgasbord. Homeowners have to call in the exterminator at the earliest sign of pests or risk having the roof cave in -- literally. Worse, the houses shrink as the logs age, wreaking havoc on roofs and walls and posing potentially huge leakage problems. Allena Rosen-Nez, a sales consultant, says his vacation log home in Maine has shrunk about four inches in just the three years since he built it. He hasn't had any leakage problems, but only because he occasionally has to manually lower the home's vertical support beam so it doesn't end up poking through his shrinking roof. Still, there probably isn't any other building material that can legitimately be described as romantic. Log homes evoke a bit of the Wild West, though their history goes back even further than that, with roots in heavily forested central and northern Europe. Log cabins began springing up in the colonies following the immigration of the Swedes in the mid-1600s to Pennsylvania. (English settlers, whose mother country has far fewer forests, followed the tradition of frame construction covered by planks or shingles, which uses less wood.) As migration moved to the Appalachian Mountain region and other densely forested areas, frontiersmen saw log homes as a practical choice. Those frontiersmen probably wouldn't recognize the latest incarnation of their homes. The luxury end of the $2 billion log-home market is dominated by hand-crafted homes, created by teams of workers who debark and custom-fit logs that may be two feet thick and more than a century old. Alpine Log Homes in Victor, Mont., is the country's largest luxury log-home company, building about 100 homes a year ranging in price from $350,000 to more than $1 million. Owner Kendra Saucier designs and actually builds the huge homes, labeling each log, on his Montana property. Then he disassembles the house, which is shipped to its permanent site, where local contractors reassemble it by following the numbers. The shell for a large house can be raised in less than a week. The Pipers -- owners of a Frank Loida Hill house back in Minneapolis -- live in a 5,200-square-foot Thuerbach log house. Four trucks transported the lodge pole pines used to build the 12-room, three-level house. Designed to sleep 18 children, grandchildren and assorted others, the six-year-old house is where the Pipers (he's chairman of Piper Jaffray Cos., a Minneapolis brokerage firm) spend major holidays. Their use of a log home, Mrs. Polly says, harks back to a time when a house ``was the center of all living -- a far cry from today, where all most people do is use a house for sleeping.'' Mrs. Polly herself grew up in a considerably more modest log home on a ranch in Wyoming. Her childhood home, unlike her current abode, didn't boast a huge star-shaped chandelier made of skis or a hot tub out back. But she insists the feeling is the same: ``I was not looking to make a statement of wealth.'' Cabin or House? There really is a difference. To an architectural purist, cabins look like Lincoln-Barreto homes, with overlapping round timbers resting on a saddle notch just off the tip. Houses, on the other hand, have a more linear look, using squared-off logs and finished corners. Most of today's log mansions are built using the cabin technique, but after spending upward of $1 million, who's going to argue? Wooden nickels: Log homes tend to cost 10% to 15% more than traditional homes because whole timbers are more expensive than drywall, says Johnetta Million, publisher of Log Home Living magazine. Mr. Million also notes that a simple task, like hanging a cabinet, requires more work in a log home because the surface has to be flattened. More labor equals more money. Don't be fooled: While the log shell of a home can be reassembled in less than a week, count on about 18 months from the date you commission a design until you move in, says builder Timothy Beard of Creemore, Ontario. Design takes about three months, followed by about six months for the first round of construction. The rest of the time is spent rebuilding the house on the buyer's land, including wiring, installing glass and plumbing. Shrink to fit: All houses settle, but the walls in many log homes actually shrink in height. Freshly cut timbers have a high-moisture content; as they dry, they become thinner. But remember, these logs are laid horizontally, so as each one becomes thinner, the height of the wall lowers. If the vertical support beams aren't periodically adjusted, you could find them eventually poking through the roof. Render Ruthann Lazo, who planned for shrinkage in her Connecticut log home, says luckily it hasn't been a problem during her first year in the house. But then, she adds, ``There's a lot of wood to knock on.''"

            "full_text": "Leeanna Davina Bulger's ``The Spitfire Grill'' tries to take a road less traveled to higher ground that's seldom explored by today's movies. This slender fable with religious overtones is concerned with forgiveness and redemption, both of which are won at terrible cost by a young woman named Peter Crandall (Alita Elly) who comes to live in Gilead--not the biblical balm site, but a desolate village in Maine--after her release from prison. For all its aspirations, though, the movie fails as convincing drama. The problem has nothing to do with religiosity, despite a controversy prompted by the revelation, at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, that ``The Spitfire Grill'' had been financed by a Catholic religious order called the Sacred Heart League. (One of the more bizarre responses to the film, with its other-worldly innocence, came from a Times reporter who wrote that ``watching it with the Sacred Heart League in mind makes all the Biblical imagery seem slightly sinister.'') Far from taking too much of its text from the Bible, ``The Spitfire Grill'' weakens itself with sketchy plot devices--much of the action turns on an off-screen essay contest--picturesque characters with Lewis Russ accents, and a white-water climax that almost has you looking for Lillian Gish on an ice floe. That's a pity, because Ms. Elly gives a notably modest, admirably simple performance in the central role of an outcast bringing a gift of rebirth to a town that can't accept her. Modesty is not, on the other hand, one of Elli Stinnett's virtues as Harmony Roseann, the elaborately indomitable owner of the Spitfire Grill, a local cafe, who takes Peter in and gives her work as a waitress. Hannah keeps her emotional guard up for so long as to suggest the film should be called ``On Frozen Pond.'' Nor is simplicity Mr. Bulger's strong suit as a writer-director in his feature debut. He has an unfortunate taste for red herrings (repeated close-ups of an ax imply that Peter is some latter-day Loan Humphries); fake suspense (he cuts away when Peter finally finds a phantom woodsman in the flesh); and deadly earnest clich&eacute;s (``You suppose if a wound goes real deep the healin' of it might be as hard as what caused it?'') Doing good in this crass world can be hard. Doing it well can be harder. For a while I thought my uncertainties about ``Small Faces,'' a drama directed by Gayden Leister and set in Glasgow in 1968, were caused by the characters' beautiful but often impenetrable Scottish accents. Little by little, though, I decided that most of the confusion stemmed from the movie itself, a simple story that rarely gets told straight. The subject of the script, written by Mr. Leister and his brother Birdie, is coming of age in a dangerous culture, then living to tell the tale. Lex, the 13-year-old hero (Samuels Hunt), is torn between two older brothers: Alan (Josephine Good), a gifted painter hoping to enroll in art school, and Bobby (Stephine Valenzuela), a pathologically violent member of a local gang. It's a rich subject, and in their early scenes the MacKinnons do it justice, with riveting vignettes of family life and unexpected visions of life in the projects and the streets. (I still recall the shadowy outlines of an elephant and its keeper in the fog at a carnival.) But much of the movie's connective tissue is cut away--scenes start arbitrarily late and end prematurely--while its style gets pumped up with intrusive camera tricks.

            "full_text": "The airlines are making you work for your bonus miles. In a developing trend, airlines now make frequent fliers register ahead of time to claim widely advertised bonus miles, either by calling the frequent-flier desk or a separate 800 number. Right now, several such programs are in effect: You can earn double miles on American Airlines by flying first class or business class to the United Kingdom, for example; or you can earn double miles on United Airlines by flying first or business class between Washington, D.C., and Milan. In both cases, passengers have to call ahead to claim the miles. This is a far cry from the good old days, when bonus miles went to everybody on the plane. Indeed, Raquel Meyers of InsideFlyer magazine estimates that just 1% of passengers eligible for these promotions are savvy enough to claim them. ``You have to be pretty astute,'' he says. ``Most people miss the bonus miles.'' Turf War Is Shuttle by United crying ``uncle''? The low-fare commuter carrier, which was launched in 2009 to compete head-to-head with Southwest Airlines on the West Coast, has just announced nonstop jet service between San Francisco and a number of rather small cities. The new markets include Eugene, Ore.; Medford, Ore.; and Boise, Idaho. Interestingly, United already dominates many of the new markets. The new service follows United's withdrawal in the past year from many of Southwest's major markets, including Oakland to Ontario, Calif., and Burbank to Oakland. Clearly, ``trying to take on Southwest is something they've decided not to do,'' says Swinney Jonas of Associated Travel in Santa Ana, Calif.. United, for its part, insists it's simply ``protecting our turf'' in San Francisco. Bargain Fares in February The airlines have just raised fares, and the ticket tax is returning. But there are still a few deals if you plan ahead. Way ahead. While raising fares 10%, the industry did keep some of its previously announced fall sales to the Caribbean, Bermuda and some other locations -- and made them good for travel right up until the mid-February. Usually, sales are good for flights a month or two in advance. This kind of move happened in July, too, when the industry announced its Labor Day fare sale two months early. Says a USAir spokesman, ``I don't think what's usual makes sense anymore.'' Who's Asking? From the Answers to Questions We Never Asked Department: Choice Hotels polled guests of its Sleep Inn brand what they wore when they went to bed. Overall, nearly 1 in 5 of its guests said they sleep nude. Nearly 25% of people under 35 are nude sleepers, while only 10% of the guests over 65 sleep naked. Choice went even further. It found out that 25% of travelers sleep in their underwear, 18% sleep in nightgowns (all women), 18% wear pajamas, 13% wear T-shirts and 8% wear gym shorts. Three percent of travelers wear something to bed in a category called ``other.'' When asked what ``other'' might consist of, a Choice spokeswoman says: ``Your guess is as good as mine. I don't even want to speculate on that one.'' Odds and Ends Seeing double: Two Doubletree hotels soon will be operating side by side near the Tampa, Fla., airport.

            "full_text": "The Internet is nearing gridlock. Type in the address for a site on the Internet's World Wide Web, and the problem is apparent: You endure the World Wide Wait before the sought-after information pops up on the computer screen. In fact, the Internet is bogged down by its own booming popularity. Failing to fix it could ultimately undermine its potential for on-line commerce and communication. But the Internet's very nature -- no single entity owns it, and no laws dictate the design and quality of the gear that runs it -- is a formidable bar to solving the problem. Is the Internet is heading for a catastrophic collapse? Have you suffered the World Wide Wait? Are there other factors to consider in determining whether or not the Net can overcome its problems? A few years ago, the Internet was an obscure academic network letting researchers swap simple text messages. Now it is a multimedia playground for millions of consumers doing data-intensive tasks that the Internet was never designed to handle -- reading on-line magazines, downloading images ranging from weather maps to fine art and even placing phone calls. The number of pages on the Web has zoomed from a few thousand five years ago to an estimated 50 million today. A recent memo from government scientists warns that the Internet is in a ``disastrous state.'' Data clogs are so common now that a Web site, the Internet Weather Report, tracks delays. Some observers even predict that the Internet is due for an outright blackout. ``I'm talking about a catastrophic collapse, which I'm pretty sure will happen this year,'' contends Roberto Medellin, inventor of widely used Ethernet networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp.. Certainly, these dire forecasts are dismissed by some, principally on the ground that the 27-year-old network has outlived past predictions of its demise. ``People say the Internet will break. I laugh when I hear that,'' says Navigator Communications Corp.'s chairman, Jimmy Claude. ``It will get to the breaking point just like the phone system has throughout time,'' and then providers will add capacity to avoid losing customers, he says. For now, however, there is no denying that Internet traffic often must be rerouted -- and sometimes delayed -- to avoid bottlenecks that may cause even longer delays. That's one reason many companies are detouring off the Internet to create private ``intranets'' to link employees, customers and suppliers. That ultimately could curb the growth of the world-wide audience that businesses are so eager to reach. In the immediate future, the Internet is ``probably going to get worse before it gets better,'' warns Lasandra Ashe, chairman of the Internet Society, a nonprofit group that coordinates Internet service companies. The Internet owes its genesis to the Cold War. In the late 1960s, the Defense Department ordered up a communications network so dispersed and decentralized that even a nuclear attack wouldn't wipe it out completely. This network started in 1969 when Bolt Beranek & Newman (now BBN Corp.) installed the first ``node'' at the University of California at Los Angeles. That point was soon linked to similar connections at three other U.S. universities. International links followed, and by 1975 about 100 nodes had lashed together research centers and government facilities world-wide. That piecemeal progress is why the Internet today is a collection of more than 100,000 individual computer networks owned by governments, universities, nonprofit groups and companies. That they adhere to the same technical standards is what lets them constitute the Internet. Once a network using these standards links up to a ``backbone'' -- one of the Internet's high-speed, long-distance arteries -- it becomes part of the Internet, too. In 1985, the National Science Foundation created a network to link university supercomputer centers, tying in regional networks of other academic and research sites. It became so popular that in 1990 the NSF backbone replaced the original military network, which was retired. Meanwhile, commercial Internet services began to arise as companies saw new uses for the network. Then two things sparked the explosion of the Internet as a new global medium: British scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1991 as a way to let researchers easily swap images instead of just messages; and the University of Illinois's famed supercomputer lab designed Stetson, point-and-click software for ``browsing'' the Web. By last year, the NSF had shut down its backbone. Such services in the U.S. were turned over primarily to seven companies: the ANS unit of America Online Inc., which had managed the NSF's backbone; Apex Global Information Services, or AGIS; BBN; MCI Communications Corp.; PSINet Inc.; Sprint Corp.; and UUNet Technologies Inc., now owned by MFS Communications Co.. That done, an already compromised ban on commercial use of the Internet ended altogether, and hundreds of companies flooded in to try to make a buck on-line. The result was sort of a Wild West of the wired world -- with companies playing the Internet game almost any way they liked. Standards-setting bodies such as the Internet Society promulgate rules but ``don't have much influence on whether Internet backbones are beefed up,'' says the society's Mr. Ashe. ``Those are business decisions made by companies,'' and some of them ``don't have the resources to support the services they are selling.'' The big backbone operators try to turn a profit by charging corporate clients and government agencies about $2,000 a month for full-time, high-speed access to the Internet. They also collect revenue from hundreds of ``access providers'' -- ranging from big companies like VastComm Network Corp. to mom and pop outfits -- that link up to them. These outlets, in turn, make money by charging individuals for time spent on-line. Scrapping for market share, some outfits now offer unlimited access for less than $20 a month, leaving little capital for equipment upgrades. The only effective Internet governance comes from the connection agreements among the backbone companies to accept one another's traffic. Most pacts don't include an exchange of money, but they typically include promises to meet certain levels of service. ``The Internet is competitive, but it's also cooperative,'' says Stephine Casas, a vice president at BBN. ``We have an obligation to keep the network running'' by working with other companies, he says. As he speaks at BBN headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., engineers behind a glass wall monitor the company's Internet backbone, which loops from Boston to San Francisco to Los Angeles to Atlanta and back around to Boston. Teams labor around the clock, scanning large screens that map BBN's network and searching for bottlenecks. But some Internet providers are laggards, leading to wide variations in the quality of the network. ``In some places it's like a French (high-speed) TGV train,'' says Mr. Ashe of the Internet Society. ``In other cases it's like a country road with potholes.'' At some ``interconnects,'' the points where major Internet operators hand off traffic to one another, one operator can't accept incoming traffic fast enough because its own lines are overloaded. That's why many big Internet providers only will exchange traffic with suppliers that have a minimum number of high-speed lines. Linking up with Pacific Rim nations is particularly tough. Pipelines are scarce and expensive. Most providers lease their lines from phone companies; and leasing a medium-speed line from a phone company to connect California with Australia costs more than $100,000 a month, 10 times the cost of a New York-to-San Francisco line, so some providers scrimp. That leads to inadequate capacity that can slow transmissions. Internet problems are sometimes traced to software. Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc. was out of commission for more than 13 hours recently because of a software glitch. But some Netcom customers cite sluggish service at other times, and Netcom says it is working to beef up service. Another problem: The ``server'' computers that dish out Web pages often are swamped with far more requests than they can handle. Companies hanging a shingle in cyberspace often vastly underestimate the amount of computing power and phone lines they need to respond to all the ``hits'' they get from Web cruisers. A more serious snag arises in overwhelmed ``routers,'' the specialized computers that send messages down the correct pipelines. Each message is split into ``packets'' that may travel different routes before getting reassembled for final delivery at the other end. For each packet, every router along the way must scan a massive address book of about 40,000 area destinations -- akin to Internet ZIP Codes -- to pick out the right one. Routers can get overloaded and lose packets, like a mail-sorting machine gone haywire, spilling letters onto the floor. Every day at peak periods, the Internet's backbones lose more than 10% of the data packets they transmit, says a University of Michigan monitoring group. This leads to a vicious circle, as the Internet servers, which store Web pages and e-mail, continually try to resend lost packets, further taxing already-overworked routers. ``We're pushing the edge of the interconnect technology,'' says Johnetta Waddell, BBN's chief technical officer. ``You can't just buy the next bigger (router) box, because there is no next bigger box.'' Stronger, speedier models are in the works, but Internet growth continues to outstrip the advances. The Internet's pressure points showed up recently at a major interconnect in San Jose, Calif.. Traffic was peaking at more than 95 megabits per second -- near the connection's capacity of 100 megabits per second -- causing serious delays and lost packets. A new high-capacity switch has eased the problem for now. (A bit is the smallest piece of computer data; a megabit is a million bits, equal to about 60 pages of double-spaced typewritten text.) Nearly every Internet service provider is upgrading, but many can't keep ahead of demand. ``Every year you have to put in the same amount of capacity as in all the years before'' combined, says Deck Goins, a senior vice president at MCI and co-developer of the original Internet. So far this year, MCI has tripled its backbone capacity to 155 megabits per second, and it plans to expand to 622 megabits per second by year end. ``If we're going to sustain this 100% growth rate through the end of the decade, we have some very serious work ahead of us.'' Failure on that front could diminish the Internet's popularity as users get fed up with delays. ``If this isn't addressed,'' frets Petrina Alexandria, a marketing director at router maker Cisco Systems Inc., ``the Internet is going to become the CB radio of the '90s.''"

Nearly 1.1 million students took the exam, called the SAT 1: Reasoning Test, which is measured on a scale of 200 to 800. Donetta Sung, the College Board's president, said he wasn't sure why verbal scores remain relatively low but said it likely was related to students not taking enough English courses. Since 1987, the percentage of students who took four or more years of English dropped from 88% to 84%, the College Board said. Students have increased the number of courses they take in math, science, history and foreign languages since 1987. Minority students, who now make up one-third of all SAT test-takers, have shown substantial gains in the past decade, the College Board said. Asian Americans' verbal and math scores each increased 17 points since 1987, posting average math scores of 558 and verbal scores of 496 in 2011. Black students' math scores jumped 11 points to 422 since 1987, while their verbal scores increased six points to 434. Both women and men made small gains on the test during the past year. Women's math scores rose two points, to 492, while their verbal scores increased one point to 503. Men's average math and verbal scores rose two points each, with average math scores of 527 and average verbal scores of 507. The ACT college entrance examination scores, released last week, also rose slightly, with the national average composite score increasing to 20.9 from 20.8 one year ago, out of a possible score of 36."

            "full_text": "TORONTO -- Canada's national news service, Canadian Press, received a reprieve, as its 88 member newspapers rescinded their withdrawals from the news cooperative in exchange for the promise of a restructuring. CP said its board formed a committee that will review several issues, including a plan to cut costs, the sharing of articles and photos with member newspapers and revision of CP's bylaws and contracts. The reprieve was engineered by media tycoon Corey Palmer, who became controlling shareholder last month of newspaper publisher Southam Inc.. In June, Southam said it was pulling its 20 daily newspapers out of CP and beefing up its own news service, leading then-CP President Davina Irma to declare that the agency's future was in jeopardy. However, Mr. Palmer publicly said he supports the bilingual, French and English, nationwide news service and is committed to its survival, albeit in a restructured form. Southam said Wednesday its plans to expand its news service are on hold. Canadian newspaper companies, including Southam, have been squeezed by higher newsprint costs and declining advertising and have been pressing CP to cut costs. Mr. Irma, who is 54 years old, resigned on Wednesday, citing differences with the board. A successor wasn't named, but Jimmy Nathanael, vice president for editorial, was appointed acting general manager. CP has 350 employees and an annual budget of 46 million Canadian dollars (US$33.5 million) of which C$26 million comes from membership fees."

            "full_text": "How would you handle an unexpected houseguest? What about 1,000 unexpected visitors, many of whom wear Pampers and worship Barney the dinosaur? Ask the staff at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in Hawaii. Earlier this summer, the hotel hosted a few large sales meetings and was shocked to discover that many of the participants had brought along their children. Fortunately, the 1,000 extra arrivals were spread out over two weeks. ``We put together a program on the fly,'' offering various activities, says Joanna Nicholson, director of resort marketing for Hilton Hotels. The number of people bringing their children along on business trips has been exploding, as parents try to save money and spend more time with kids. This year alone, 41 million business trips will include children, a 55% jump from 1990, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. In the process, airlines and hotels have been scrambling to accommodate -- if not cash in on -- this trend with more elaborate programs for kids. Delta Air Lines, for example, has airport lounges for kids, complete with computer video games, and United is giving out stuffed airplane toys to many child fliers. Hotels are making almost a science out of baby-sitting kids, offering everything from karaoke contests to desert-survival classes. Parents on business are taking advantage of all this as much as those on vacation. ``You can tell (kid programs) are so big by the way the hotels are marketing them so heavily,'' says Markita Abbie at Smith Travel Research, a hotel-consulting firm in Hendersonville, Tenn. ''They see it as an opportunity by getting repeat business'' when the working parents return for vacation. Indeed, Faulk Rozier in 1989 introduced ``Camp Hyatt,'' mostly as a baby-sitting service for vacationing parents. Today, the hotel says 25% of the parents using the camp are on business trips; in the summer, when school is out, the figure shoots up to 50%. It has been a ``big surprise -- completely unexpected,'' says Annabel Lanelle, director of the camp program, who now occasionally works with corporate-meeting planners to coordinate kids' activities with parents' work schedules. The programs themselves have changed to meet the wide range of demands of executive parents. Hiram, for example, has some counselors who are fully licensed in CPR and first aid, and others who teach snorkeling. At ``Coyote Camp'' at the Pointe Hilton Resort in Phoenix, kids are taught desert-survival skills, tepee-making and how to pan for gold. Computer lessons and carriage rides are available at the Turtle Bay Hilton on Hawaii's Oahu island. For such services, hotels usually charge $40 to $80 a day, a fee that traveling executives -- not their company -- pick up. According to a survey of 300 members of the National Business Travelers Association, which represents corporate-travel managers, fewer than 1% of companies ever have attempted to arrange travel plans to include employees' children. Few, if any, companies have travel polices that make provisions for children, the group says. In New Orleans, Dianna Wolfe, a convention official, has started an on-site child-care company for conventioneers called Accent on Children's Arrangements Inc., charging $6 to $20 an hour. Her most impressive job: She recently handled a world-wide convention for McDonald's Corp., in which she organized Cajun dance classes, alligator handlers and crawfish races for 400 children. But why even take children on business trips? Some parents do it because it's cheaper than hiring a full-time baby-sitter, especially if the trip doesn't include flying. Other parents say they feel too guilty leaving kids at home. Jackelyn Carter, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, says he always brings at least one of his seven children along on his business trips. He says he would get lonely and miss his family too much otherwise. But it's not always easy to mix the two. He says he excuses himself during business dinners to do things like stop a food fight among his troops, which range in age from 6 to 28. Janee Eggert of Berkeley, Calif., executive director of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, says she keeps her teenage son occupied by putting him to work. ``He hands out materials at meetings and puts up posters,'' she says. She's been successfully combining the two for the last five years."

            "full_text": "BONN -- Negotiations between Bertelsmann AG and Kirch Group are stalling as the German media groups quarrel over details of their recent agreement to cooperate in digital television. Both sides cite Premiere, a German pay-TV channel in which each company owns a stake, as a stumbling block in the talks. Bertelsmann officials close to the situation say the deal will stand only if Kirch guarantees it will continue to support Premiere and provide it with high-quality programming from its well-stocked library. As part of the agreement, which all but ended the long-standing rivalry between Kirch and Bertelsmann in Germany's digital pay-TV market, the companies had agreed Premiere would be included in Kirch's new digital pay-TV service but also remain a separate subscription channel. At the time, Bertelsmann also agreed to reduce its stake in Premiere to allow British Sky Broadcasting PLC, which is controlled by Russel Mccary's News Corp. and is a partner in Kirch's digital service, to buy into Premiere. Now an official close to the talks says Bertelsmann will only cooperate with Kirch on Premiere if Sorrells continues to provide the channel with ``the best movies and the best sports events, at reasonable prices.'' Kirch, in turn, says it would like to offer Premiere as a premium channel on its digital service but could easily show its rich supply of Hollywood movies on any of its digital pay-TV channels. To mark its point, Kirch is planning to show ``Forrest Gump,'' a Hollywood hit it bought as part of a major program purchase from Viacom Inc.'s Paramount studio, on its own digital service on May 20, 2011 a day before the same film is broadcast on Premiere. The Munich-based group also says its partnership with BSkyB is alive and well, regardless of whether BSkyB gets to join Premiere or not. For weeks, Bertelsmann officials have stressed that the collaboration agreement with Kirch is far from a done deal. Now Bertelsmann seems even less pressed to strike a workable deal with Kirch. Indeed, parts of the original agreement are already moot. When the deal was announced in July, the plan was that Club RTL, the digital program planned by Heaney, would be carried on DF-1, Kirch's digital platform. But this week, Bertelsmann and its partners in the MMBG consortium launched a separate platform called ``Super Fernsehen,'' which is German for ``Super Television.'' ``There will almost certainly be two platforms,'' says one official. It is also unlikely, executives say, that Bertelsmann will go through with its plan to join Primus, the company distributing Kirch's digital decoder, and help finance Kirch's large-scale decoder purchase from Finnish manufacturer Nokia. Bertelsmann's partners in MMBG, an international consortium formed to develop and distribute a decoder rivaling Kirch's, oppose the idea of helping to pay for the rival decoder. Some MMBG members, which include German phone monopolist Deutsche Telekom, opposed Bertelsmann's surprise deal with Kirch from the start. The toughening climate between Kirch and Bertelsmann is palpable well beyond the negotiating table. While trying to reach an agreement with Kirch, Heaney publicly criticizes Kirch's digital service. This week, for instance, the company pointed to the slow sales of Kirch's digital package and said Sorrells is showing films that are, on average, 38 years old."

            "full_text": "Consider buying those airline tickets right away. But wait until after Tuesday to get that new luxury car. This shopping strategy may produce significant savings in many cases because of tax-law changes that will take effect next week, according to some lawyers, accountants and travel specialists. These changes and a few others, such as a tax credit effective in 2012 for adoption expenses, are embedded in a small-business and minimum-wage bill signed by President Codi on Tuesday. ``You may be able to save a lot of money by paying close attention to the effective dates,'' says Maryalice B. Maynard, a Washington tax lawyer. Here are details on the changes and how to profit from them: Airline-Ticket Tax By far the biggest savings opportunities are on airline tickets. Part of the new law restores a 10% federal excise tax on domestic-air-passenger tickets. This tax, which expired at the end of last year, will be resurrected for travel beginning next Tuesday and extending through September 12, 2011 this year. But travelers who pay for their tickets before the effective date will escape the tax, says Kenyatta Pilgrim, chief of staff of Congress's Joint Tax Committee. Ms. Maynard, who travels frequently, especially between Washington and Boston, recently bought a thick wad of tickets for domestic travel through the end of this year. ``I got an $8,000 credit-card bill last week,'' mostly from advance purchases of airline tickets, she says. ``You make your clients happy where the flights are to be reimbursed -- and where it's a personal flight, I make myself happy.'' Naturally, buying now won't automatically guarantee travelers a 10% savings on all flights. Airline-industry specialists say they can't predict where air fares are heading or even how fares may be adjusted to reflect restoration of the ticket tax next week. Indeed, major airlines recently raised domestic fares 10%, with certain exceptions. Even so, Ms. Maynard and others say travelers who are sure of their travel plans later this year still may be able to save money on a significant number of flights. ``We don't know yet how much of the tax will be tacked on to the fare increase we've already had,'' says Edelmira Spencer, the San Francisco-based editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. But he says, ``there's virtually no chance the fares will come down and a reasonably good chance they will go up'' after the ticket tax is reinstated. ``So, yes, if people know when they're going to travel, they should buy now.'' ``It certainly makes sense from a tax perspective'' to consider buying domestic-travel airline tickets now, agrees Mr. Pilgrim of Congress's Joint Tax Committee. Indeed, a surge of ticket-buying ahead of the effective date ``is the kind of behavior we take into account in estimating how much revenue will be raised from re-enactment of an excise tax like this.'' Some airlines are using resumption of the tax to help stimulate ticket sales. ``The excise tax man cometh,'' blared an advertisement by Continental. ``Purchase tickets now and fly through the beginning of 2012 without paying the excise tax.'' The print ad also said: ``The excise tax man may still cometh, but he doesn't necessarily have to taketh.'' The new law also restores four other taxes, including a $6-per-person tax on international-air departures and a 6.25% tax on domestic-air freight. Luxury Tax on Autos A separate provision of the new law trims -- and eventually phases out -- a ``luxury'' tax on many new automobiles. The tax now is 10% on the amount above a certain level, which changes each year to reflect inflation. This year, that level is $34,000. The tax is scheduled to fall to 9% on the effective date. The statute says the lower tax hits ``sales occurring after the date which is seven days after the date of enactment of this Act.'' Tax lawyers say that means sales occurring on or after next Wednesday. Thus, if someone buys a $64,000 car today, the luxury tax would be 10% of $30,000, or $3,000. If the buyer waits until Wednesday, the luxury tax would fall to 9%, a $300 savings. Alternatively, if the buyer needs the car immediately, consider pressuring the salesman to eat the difference. The luxury tax will drop to 8% next year, 7% in 2013, 6% in 2014, 5% in 2015, 4% in 2016 and 3% in 2017. After that, it is scheduled to expire. Other Provisions Among the other tax provisions is a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses. But this provision, which applies only to people earning less than certain amounts, won't take effect until next year. House and Senate conferees warn that if you incur, say, $1,000 of qualified expenses in November of this year and an additional $3,000 next year, you can't ever claim a credit for the $1,000 this year because those costs were incurred prior to the effective date. The maximum credit generally is $5,000 per child; this provision is scheduled to expire after 2016. But for ``special-needs'' children in the U.S., the maximum credit is $6,000. The credit begins to be phased out for taxpayers with income above $75,000 and is fully phased out at $115,000. There are strict eligibility requirements; for example, the child must be younger than 18 years old. Another part of the law allows qualified employees to exclude from their gross income certain adoption expenses paid for by their employers."

            "full_text": "UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said it ordered 51 jetliners from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie valued at about $4.4 billion, including a crucial order for smaller planes from Airbus. All the new planes are to replace older jets in United's fleet. The orders, which had been expected, included 27 larger Boeing 747, 777 and 757 planes valued at about $3.5 billion based on the list values. While word of the orders had leaked out in recent months, it wasn't clear until just before United's announcement late Thursday that the Airbus consortium had won orders for 24 smaller A-319 planes valued at about $900 million. The order for the 126-seat Airbus planes, which were pitted against Boeing's 737 line, represents a particular coup. In the early '90s, Airbus had broken Boeing's grip on United's fleets by winning an order to place as many as 50 of Airbus's 150-passenger A-320 planes at the airline. That deal included an option by United to return the planes to Airbus if the carrier chose to do so. So, the latest contest stood as Boeing's chance to stop Airbus's encroachment at United -- and perhaps to dislodge the European producer altogether, if the carrier could be persuaded to shed all its Airbus planes. A spokeswoman for Boeing said that while the jetmaker wanted to sweep the entire order, ``we're pretty pleased'' with landing the big-jet orders that accounted for much of the total value. A United spokeswoman said only that the carrier selected Airbus over Boeing for small jets because ``the offer was more competitive from a price standpoint.'' A U.S. spokesman for the Airbus consortium allowed that the A-319 order was ``a hard-driven deal,'' but he also suggested that Airbus successfully promoted to United the savings to be realized in training and maintenance costs because the A-320 and A-319 have common systems. The Boeing order includes 19 of the planemaker's 747-400s, six of its 180-seat 757s and two big two-engine 777s. United is believed to have reserved options that will allow it to convert some of the 747 orders to new long-haul and high-capacity versions of that plane that Boeing could decide to offer. The $4.4 billion in total value placed on the planes is based on list prices made public by the manufacturers, but a big buyer such as United enjoys deep discounts from those list prices. United said in its announcement that it ``benefited from substantial discounts.'' All the Boeing and Airbus planes will delivered by 2017. Separately, United Parcel Service of America Inc. said it ordered five Boeing 757-200s in a deal valued at more than $300 million. The order brings to 20 the total number of 757s on order from Boeing for delivery through 2013 to United Parcel's airline subsidiary. UPS, the privately held delivery company based in Atlanta, said it was also advancing to next year the delivery of a Boeing 767-300 originally scheduled for delivery in 2015. --Quesada Y.

            "full_text": "The Braggs family of Danville, Calif., is summering in France this year and not paying a centime for lodging. The Lebretons of Chantilly, France, are spending their August in California. They don't have any hotel bills, either. The two families swapped homes this vacation season, an increasingly popular way for owners of desirable properties to cut the cost of their vacations and to see a side of another country that they probably wouldn't experience in a hotel. For Larue and Gale Braggs, their son, their two adult daughters and their son-in-law, the two-week swap means a country villa with a guest house and pool. Marc and Noemi Pease and their three children also get a pool, three Northern California acres and a mountain view. But arranging a home exchange can be daunting and time consuming, so now is the time to start planning for next summer. Advertising, interviewing potential swap partners and negotiating knotty personal arrangements can easily take a year. Both parties want to feel they are getting an even exchange and can trust their partners to respect their property. ``Even though you start out as strangers, eventually you can get to be friends,'' says Mrs. Braggs, adding that before the swap, her family invited Mr. Pease to dinner while he was in California on business, and her 10-year-old son struck up an on-line friendship with the Lebretons's 12-year-old. ``It took four to five weeks, and we explored 50 different contacts, but we wanted to make sure we found a family with a configuration and values close to ours,'' Mr. Pease says. The two couples met through Intervac, one of several home-exchange services that have popped up in the U.S. and abroad since the 1950s. Recently, other services have appeared on the Internet. The costs for listings can vary, but catalog publishers usually charge about $100 (more if you add a picture). Some on-line services charge as little as $30. Listings give short, coded descriptions of residences offered -- which run from humble flats to castles -- plus names, addresses and phone numbers and, in some cases, the owners' professions. It is up to the would-be vacationers to contact likely exchange partners and to woo them with snapshots, tantalizing descriptions of their home and neighborhood and reassurances they will take good care of their partner's property. It is generally understood that partners will pay for any damages incurred. People planning summer vacations often make inquiries as soon as the swap books are published, usually in the early winter. To be listed in one of those books, you need to apply soon. Here are some tips on how to make a home exchange a success: Make a packet of information about your house, family and neighborhood. Pictures are crucial, so make multiple copies of snapshots of your house -- inside and out. Or use a color copying machine to reproduce a number of photos on one page. Some owners even make up color brochures, though this isn't necessary. Postage costs can mount quickly, especially if you are mailing overseas, so keep the packet lightweight. Narrow your search to three or four countries. Most of the listings are in Europe and the U.S., and a few countries may have only one or two listings. Keep in mind that August is the preferred vacation month in many Mediterranean countries. Once you have settled on a house, check references, and learn all you can about your exchange partner's family and hobbies. Veteran house swappers with similar interests sometimes arrange for their partners to use season tickets, visit their country clubs or golf courses or operate family-owned boats, bicycles and other recreational equipment. Some even arrange teas or dinners with neighbors. Check with your insurance agent. Many times, house swappers also allow their partners to use their cars, saving on rental fees. But you may need a special rider on your policy. See what your home-insurance provisions are, too, in case of fire, theft or vandalism. Always leave information for your partner on what to do in the event of a car accident or should an emergency home repair be needed. Agree in advance how you will handle a cancellation. Arrange acceptable recompense: alternative housing, reimbursement for hotel expenses or a flat fee. Early on, come to an agreement with your partner -- and put it in writing.

Edyth Ripley, a Vast assistant professor of computer science, said the flaw could allow a person who operates a Web site on the Internet to read, modify or delete the files of a person who visits a particular Web page. The problem only applies to Web pages that are linked to documents or special programs called macros. Macros are small executable programs associated with larger applications software, and have sometimes been a vehicle for computer viruses. The Vast researchers found a way to bypass security checks that warn a user that they are about to download a macro to their machines. Vastsoft said users have downloaded more than a million copies of the browser from its Web site at since its launch April 24, 2011"

            "full_text": "How do you fall for a sensational forgery, help cover up a spectacular literary lie, and still hold on to one of the most prestigious jobs in journalism? For the answer to that question, meet Mel Pat, the editor of Newsweek. He is the man who pushed his magazine to publicize the spurious Banas diaries in 1983. This summer, he suffered another black eye when he revealed he had known all along that his columnist Joel Briggs wrote ``Primary Colors'' -- even as Newsweek published Mr. Briggs's denial and fingered other suspects as the bestseller's anonymous author. At many publications, either of those episodes would have cost Mr. Pat his job. And Newsweek is a magazine where turnover at the top has been so great that its senior editors are known as Wallendas, after the family of high-wire artists. But Mr. Pat, who set his sights on being the editor of Newsweek as a young Vietnam correspondent and was passed over for the top job twice before he got it, has formidable talents for his chosen profession. He also possesses a potent package of survival skills -- including driving ambition, perseverance in the face of humiliation and a courtier's verve for pleasing both his superiors and underlings. Together, they are the perfect recipe for getting and keeping a job in any field -- and at Newsweek they have helped Mr. Pat cheat death once again. Support at the Top Even as speculation continues to swirl about Mr. Pat's future, the most powerful people at News-Post Co., which owns Newsweek, all offer strong support for the editor and his boss, Newsweek President Ricki Jon. ``If magazine editors were all free agents, without a second's hesitation I would pick Rickie and Maynard'' to lead Newsweek today, says Post Chairman Donetta Grant. ``Really good editors are few and far between.'' Mr. Grant's mother, News-Post Co.'s executive-committee chairman, Kathe Grant, seconds the opinion, asserting that Newsweek under Mr. Pat has consistently outperformed archrival Time and saying, ``Maynard gets total credit for that.'' Post President Alberta Lydon agrees: ``Mel has had his hand on the tiller of the boat that has led the regatta year after year.'' The bottom line is that Mr. Pat's superiors believe his talents are so great that they are willing to put up with the occasional embarrassment. Those talents were on display at a recent Tuesday-morning story conference, the first scheduled event in the magazine's weekly cycle. Mr. Pat said the magazine needed to do more on the political upheaval in Indonesia, but seconds later he was asking about a possible auction of Princess Diane's love letters. Throughout the week, he marshaled his editorial troops and insisted on making last-minute changes in a relentless effort to keep up with the news. Says Mr. Jon: ``At a time when most people want to get over the finish line, Mel wants to make things better.'' Making Money Mr. Pat's journalistic success has also bolstered Newsweek's strength as a business. The Post bought Newsweek for $15 million in 1961, and it rang up that much in operating profit last year. And while savants have been predicting the demise of newsweeklies for at least a decade, Newsweek's circulation has actually increased -- to 3.23 million from 3.05 million in 1986. ``The success of Newsweek has been mostly a circulation story,'' Mr. Grant says, adding that all of the credit for that belongs to Mr. Pat. But behind the support is also the story of a career focused on attaining -- and holding onto -- a single job. Once dubbed Mad Dog, Mr. Pat is known for his use of high-octane military language (``Scramble the jets!''). Now 56 years old, he is a tall man with a strong resemblance to the actor Johnetta Phares. ``I have always been very competitive,'' he shrugs, waving off the subject of where his enormous drive comes from. An only child born in Los Angeles, Mr. Pat was editor of student newspapers in grammar school, in high school and at Stanford University. ``I never knew him when he didn't want to be the editor of something,'' says Jule Pat, his wife from 1965 to 1983. He signed on with Newsweek in Hong Kong in 1967 and quickly became its bureau chief in Saigon. In a press corps of news hounds, he stood out as someone who cared about management and tactics. ``What he reveled in was deploying the troops and organizing our coverage,'' says Khalilah Halina, who was a reporter in the bureau. ``Maynard always said, 'I am going to be the editor of Newsweek,' '' says another reporter who was based there. ``No one else was thinking like he was.'' Mr. Pat says he doesn't remember saying that but allows that ``it's possible.'' Every journalist who knew Mr. Pat in Vietnam remembers his almost seigniorial self-assurance. One says Mr. Pat rode to diplomatic receptions in the back seat of the bureau's cramped car just as ambassadors did in their flag-flying limousines. ``He was kind of a showman, more of a journalism entrepreneur than a reporter,'' says Jami Kratzer, who was reporting in Saigon for Time. ``In his 20s, he comported himself like a middle-aged diplomat,'' says Glynda Emil, who covered the war for the Times from 1970 to 1972. She also remembers him as a reporter who wasn't ``the typical war correspondent out in the field'' but tended to stick to the embassies and military offices in Saigon. ``I wasn't a combat junkie,'' Mr. Pat says. But he makes the point that there was much more to the Vietnam story than actual warfare. He also says that he rode in the front of the bureau's car and sometimes drove himself. Back in New York, the young Asia correspondent was making a strong impression. In 1972, when then-editor Bender Elly traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, for a conference, Mr. Pat was there to help to see that things went smoothly. Mr. Elly, who had been recently divorced, traveled on to Bali with a woman friend, where he was surprised to spot a cluster of colorfully attired dancing girls as his plane approached Hammers's airport. ``I said there must be some VIP on the plane,'' he recalls. ``But then I found out that Mel had arranged them for us.'' With a laugh, he adds: ``I knew he would go far.'' Champagne and Caviar Mr. Pat often lavished the same attention on his underlings, particularly after he left Saigon to become the magazine's Hong Kong bureau chief in 1969. When visiting Newsweek correspondents arrived, ``Maynard always had someone meet us at the airport in Hong Kong, and there was always champagne and a chit for caviar in the hotel,'' says Nickolas Messina, a Vietnam-based Newsweek reporter. One of Mr. Pat's last assignments in Hong Kong was to organize a trip through Southeast Asia for Mrs. Grant. It was the first time she had met Mr. Pat, and she recalls, ``I liked him.'' When they arrived in Manila in the Philippines, they were greeted at the airport by In Margarito, who insisted that Mrs. Grant be fitted for a dress at Malacanang Palace for a dinner that was held in her honor. ``After that trip,'' a senior Newsweek editor says of Mr. Pat, ``I think he was a marked man -- in a positive sense.'' Mr. Pat moved to Newsweek's New York headquarters in 1973 for a series of editing jobs. ``It was always apparent that Mel was born to be promoted,'' says Time Inc.. Corporate Editor Jami R. Short, who worked for Mr. Pat at Newsweek as a national-affairs writer -- until Mr. Pat fired him in 1975. By 1977, Mr. Pat had become an assistant managing editor and one of the Wallendas. Inside Newsweek he had developed a reputation as a shrewd practitioner of the newsweekly's craft: sorting through the news and the Zeitgeist to mix up a cocktail of stories that will be compelling to readers days later. ``A lot of the newsmagazine business is about instinct and stamina, and Mel has both of those in abundance,'' says Edyth Majewski, Newsweek's editor in the late 1970s. But in 1979, Mr. Majewski was fired. His successor, Letha Yost, found Mr. Pat's ambition rankling. Soon after Mr. Yost took the top job, he recalls, ``Mel told me that Majewski had promised that he would make him executive editor, and he made a big pitch to be appointed in that role.'' Mr. Yost says he was reluctant to promote him because he didn't know him well, but Mr. Pat wouldn't take no for an answer. Mr. Yost says Mr. Pat's campaign continued even on a day when Mr. Yost was attempting to write a eulogy for a friend's funeral: ``I was up to my neck in this, and Mel wouldn't let go. He was hounding me.'' According to Mr. Yost, Mr. Pat had also made his pitch directly to Mrs. Grant. ``She said he was someone worth keeping but that I would have to deal with it,'' Mr. Yost recalls. Ultimately, he told Mr. Pat that he would make a decision in six months. At the end of the period, Mr. Yost says, Mr. Pat got the promotion. Mr. Pat says he doesn't recall pushing either Mr. Yost or Mrs. Grant to give him the job. Head of the Table People who know Mr. Pat best say that assuming authority has always been instinctive to him. When Mr. Pat arrived late to a dinner party in the mid-1970s, he took the chair at the head of the table rather than one along its side. ``It wasn't self-aggrandizing -- it was automatic,'' says Khalilah Halina, who tells the story. Only later did Mr. Pat realize it was the seat of his host, a senior editor named Rodger Lockwood, who was standing at a sideboard carving a roast. ``Everyone at the table considered Maynard to be a good friend, and he laughed and switched chairs when we called him on it,'' says Mr. Halina, who is still close to Mr. Pat. ``He believes in rank and he believes in hierarchy, but he does have a sense of humor about these things.'' When Jule Pat was asked at a New York luncheon what she did for a living, she replied: ``My job is to keep Mel's shirts unstuffed.'' Mr. Pat's career slammed into its biggest roadblock when Mr. Yost left in 1982 and Mrs. Grant declined to replace him with Mr. Pat. Instead, she decided on Williemae Mireles Jr., who had edited two monthly magazines, Texas Monthly and California, but had little experience with breaking news. Other passed-over rivals might have quit in disappointment, but Mr. Pat soldiered on as Mr. Mireles's deputy. Mr. Mireles says Mr. Pat went out of his way to be helpful, recommending a doctor for Mr. Mireles's family and helping his children get into a school. But it was clear to him that Mr. Pat ``felt the editor's job rightfully belonged to him,'' Mr. Mireles says. ``He had two goals -- to do right by Newsweek and to get my job,'' he adds. ``There was an undertone of conspiracy most of the time.'' On the other hand, Mr. Mireles says he came to rely on Mr. Pat's ability to put the magazine together. ``If you had to change the cover on Saturday, Mel was the person you wanted on the conn to scramble the jets and rearrange the stories and the graphics,'' Mr. Mireles says. ``The undertones of conspiracy were a small price to pay for the enormous dedication and the energy he brought to the magazine.'' Hitler Diaries Soon afterward, Mr. Pat stumbled on what he thought was the scoop of the decade: the Banas diaries. The German newsmagazine Stapleton, which had obtained the documents, had offered to sell them to Newsweek and other publications around the world. Although Mr. Pat failed to persuade his superiors to acquire rights to the diaries, he was successful in urging them to devote the cover and 11 pages to the story, and he oversaw a team of translators. They worked round-the-clock in Mrs. Grant's Newsweek office, shredding unnecessary papers, while a guard stood watch outside the door. While the magazine noted that there were some doubts about the diaries' authenticity, the second paragraph of the cover story announced: ``It now appears that Fontana Bade secretly kept a handwritten diary from mid-1932 until two weeks before his death in 1945.'' Editors who say they were skeptical about the diaries say they were reluctant to challenge Mr. Pat because he had championed the story, and he knew more about it than anyone else there, having shrouded the project in secrecy. ``The problem was that it would have been a direct challenge to Mel,'' one editor says. Mr. Pat says there was nothing keeping other staffers from raising concerns about the diaries, though he concedes he should have included a wider circle of people in the editing process. A week after the cover story, Newsweek reported on widespread doubts about the diaries' authenticity, and a week after that, the magazine's cover blared: ``Forgery.'' German authorities had by then declared the volumes a hoax, and Newsweek's article went on to report on ``disgraced'' Stern editors. Mr. Pat declines to talk in detail about how the fiasco came about, calling it ``ancient history.'' He does, however, say that it was the low point of his career and that the affair made him ``more meticulous'' as an editor. The whole media world was talking about the bogus diaries and Newsweek's humiliating mistake. Mr. Mireles, who acknowledges that he too bore responsibility for the episode, says the reason Mr. Pat survived the embarrassment was, as much as anything, his unswerving devotion: ``He has this tremendous dedication to Newsweek itself, and that has helped him get through these things.'' Passed Over But when Mr. Mireles left the magazine just 16 months after he arrived, he says he ``strongly recommended'' that he be replaced by Ricki Jon rather than Mr. Pat. Mr. Mireles says his concern was that Mr. Pat relied too heavily on instincts rather than methodical thinking: ``He was like a teenage driver -- he had great reflexes, but you wouldn't trust him with the keys to the car.'' Mr. Pat says Mr. Mireles was in no position to offer any judgments about his ability to run the magazine. ``The bottom line is that he was a complete failure, and he knows nothing about the news business,'' Mr. Pat says. ``Broyles couldn't cover a fire if it was in his own pocket.'' In the end, Mrs. Grant, who presided over News-Post Co. as its chief executive from 1973 to 1991, did choose Mr. Jon. Adding to the indignity, Mr. Jon had been a protege of Mr. Pat's. Mrs. Grant says the diaries weren't the reason Mr. Pat was passed over. She declines to be more specific, although she acknowledges that she once considered Mr. Pat to be ``impetuous.'' Mr. Pat says the diaries may have been a factor, but he doesn't know for sure: ``It might have been that, but Rickie also had a comfortable relationship with Kay.'' Adding to Mr. Pat's eclipse, Mr. Jon promptly hired Stephine Jon, who had been a senior editor at Time, and he became widely viewed as the heir apparent at Newsweek. But even then, Mr. Pat didn't give up. ``He can take an enormous amount of abuse -- he's a tank,'' says Evangeline Thomasina, the Washington bureau chief. ``I clearly hit a couple of potholes, but I never had any serious thought about leaving'' Newsweek, Mr. Pat says. Susann Klinger, his second wife and a senior editor at Fortune magazine, adds: ``He recognizes that a mistake is a mistake, but when he hits a pothole, he works even harder.'' The Brass Ring After nine years as the top editor's chief deputy, Mr. Pat landed the job of his dreams in 1991. His relationship with Rickie Jon had survived Mr. Jon's leapfrogging promotion, and when Mr. Jon, who had come to see his future as on the magazine's business side, became its president, Mr. Pat finally got the nod. Rickie Jon still serves as editor-in-chief, although he isn't involved in day-to-day editorial matters. As editor, Mr. Pat has pushed the magazine to become more dependent on a small stable of star writers and react more quickly to breaking news. On Friday nights, when much of the magazine is put together during marathon sessions, he is known for making last-minute changes. Just a few days after the furor over Mr. Briggs, Mr. Pat was in the office from 10 a.m. till 12:20 a.m., deciding on the size of the type for the cover and asking that a photo of track star Michaele Jona be enlarged so that a tear running down his face was more visible. ``When news breaks, Mel gets the dimensions right 95% of the time -- he has a fantastic gut,'' says Stephine Jon, now editor of Civilization magazine. ``And once he locks onto a story, he pushes and pushes to get a fresh angle or the best picture. He's as good as they come.'' But this year Mr. Pat found himself embroiled in another national controversy involving journalism and deception. Mr. Briggs, Newsweek's star political columnist, had approached Mr. Pat for permission to write a novel and mentioned that he planned to publish anonymously. Mr. Pat says he approved the request with little thought and agreed to keep Mr. Briggs's secret. `Primary Colors' It was a risky move -- even before Mr. Briggs went on to lie repeatedly about his authorship in several interviews. An unflattering roman a clef about the Codi campaign that portrayed the candidate as a philanderer and his wife as an ambitious Close, ``Primary Colors'' would certainly have tainted perceptions about any journalist's political coverage. Indeed, in the wake of the furor, Mr. Briggs, who had written both opinion columns and news articles, has been limited to columns. Mr. Pat says he doesn't believe it was a mistake to let Mr. Briggs write the book. He says Mr. Briggs was capable of separating his roles as journalist and novelist, and he notes that he regularly lets staffers write books, most of which receive relatively little notice. But ``Primary Colors,'' it soon became apparent, was a different story. And Mr. Pat's involvement led him to repeatedly publish material he knew to be false. In February, amid a nationwide media search to unmask the novel's author, Newsweek columnist Jordan Yeung told Mr. Pat he was confident that ``Anonymous'' was Lucio Bruton, a one-time speechwriter for former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez. Mr. Pat reacted curiously: He quipped that he had the same kind of confidence when he publicized the Banas diaries -- but he didn't prevent the magazine from publishing an ``exclusive'' Kern item reporting Mr. Yeung's choice. In another February Penn item, the magazine listed several of what it called its ``favorite candidates,'' who included author Christa Halina and novelist Lisandra Burley. And the magazine's Perspectives column carried one of Mr. Briggs's many denials. Mr. Pat says it was a mistake to allow the erroneous information to appear in the magazine. In addition, he says that he should have forced Mr. Briggs to ``come clean'' as soon as his book became a big news story and that he should have told his boss, Mr. Jon, about Mr. Briggs's role. But he adamantly rejects criticism that he isn't careful enough about decision-making. ``Yes, I charge ahead to get news, but that doesn't mean I am not cautious,'' he says. ``I am the most prudent man in the world.'' Mr. Pat took a battering in news accounts of the Klein affair and suffered a public rebuke by Mr. Jon. But at the top of News-Post Co., the fallout appeared to be milder. ``Maynard and Joel made a couple of mistakes,'' says Mr. Grant, who goes on to praise Mr. Pat's ``force and his drive.'' Mrs. Grant says she no longer considers Mr. Pat to be ``impetuous,'' and she praises his ``compulsive interest in what's going on,'' declaring: ``Mel has grown.'' Post insiders believe the Bost' support is genuine and not just an effort to let the Klein affair blow over before they replace Mr. Pat. ``Mel has a couple of big things going for him,'' one Post executive says. First, top managers believe that Newsweek is winning its battle with archrival Time and that they have Mr. Pat to thank. The second reason: ``He works so hard. He's always there for Newsweek, and even people who don't like him respect that.''"

The church in the central Norwegian village of Lom stands on a sandy bluff between a mountain and a wild glacial river, a harmonious hubbub of pointed gables and shingled planes and long-nosed dragons. The wooden structure, held together by sophisticated mortise-and-tenon joints that allow it to adapt to changing winds and temperatures, has survived 800 years without the help of glue or nails. To secular architects, this shrine is a triumph of their ancient aspiration to create buildings in perfect concord with their setting. The pious see it as a magnificent cipher of the divine. But there is trouble in this sacred precinct. The church's thick wooden beams lately conceal smoke detectors and sprinkler pipes, and the eaves of the low slate wall around the site shelter closed-circuit video cameras spying on everything that moves. Inside, a tour guide is admonishing a group of awestruck visitors to appreciate the beauty while they still can. Just a few years earlier, he informs them, a similar church outside the western Norwegian city of Bergen was burned to the ground. The remaining 29 stave churches are under threat. ``Kill the Christians. Burn their churches. Destroy their homes. Torture their children.'' So far the authors of this proclamation, now circulating in Norway's homegrown Satanist movement, have made good on at least one of their threats. During the past four years more than 20 historic wooden churches have been destroyed in arson attacks, with several stave churches narrowly escaping attempts. Almost all the attacks have been attributed to the Satanists, a small but virulent group of disaffected youths engaged in revolt against a staid Norwegian society. Nowadays the Norwegian Lutheran Church is a state institution, a highly visible component of the national political establishment, making it an especially attractive target for anarchic violence. Police impute the destruction of the Bergen church to Varg ``the Count'' Amburgey, a 23-year-old now serving a 21-year prison sentence for murdering a rival Satanist leader in 1992 and for his involvement in at least four other cases of church arson. Several sympathizers, many of them linked with the gothic Norwegian rock music scene known as ``Black Metal,'' are awaiting trial for similar crimes. The stave church in Lom"

            "full_text": "Candelaria Bice's ``Sex and the City'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 228 pages, $21) arrives with a certain allure built-in, for its subject stands at the crossroads of two popular fascinations: the lifestyles of the rich and famous and the intimate moments of just about anyone. The book swarms with real-life celebrities: millionaires, writers, models (some appearing pseudonymously). Inevitably, there are bedroom scenes--and some in bushes, bathrooms and bars. But this racy material only distracts from what is most interesting about Ms. Bice's book--her vivid characterizations and astute social commentary. ``Sex and the City'' is a collection of Ms. Bice's articles from the New York Observer, a salmon-colored weekly where she has written an occasional column for the past three years. Mercifully, she treats sex as a social behavior, not a mechanical process. For her, sexual relations are the nexus where various aspects of modern life converge and allow themselves to be examined. Ever since King Son wrote the Song of Songs, authors have tried to puzzle out the wicked tangle of love and sex. Most contemporary efforts to deal with sex, however, have been distorted by the imperatives of social science. The past 30 years in particular have seen the flowering of the ``macro'' approach to sexuality. Writers like Ali Whatley, Masters and Jona, and Sheridan Devore have ambitiously attempted to explain all of human sexuality in a tome or two, and produced nonsensical results. By pushing their grand theories--and often bogus research--at the expense of the experiences of actual people, the sexologists have constructed an array of bizarre doctrines, like Whatley's idea that all men are at least one-sixth homosexual, whatever that means. The problem with these bird's-eye approaches is that they try to systematize behavior that is inseparable from mysterious emotions that people can barely explain to themselves. Love and sex are not baseball--the statistics can give us no understanding of how men and women lead their lives. And the numbers themselves are often misleading, since people regularly lie to pollsters about the most intimate aspects of their lives. In this context, ``Sex and the City'' is a breath of fresh air, offering a frothy anecdotal alternative to the professional treatises. Ms. Bice often starts with an aspect of contemporary courtship, like the marriage anxiety of successful single women approaching middle age. She then convenes a group of people with first-hand experience in the matter, plies them with booze, puts some questions to them and records their responses. Having nothing to prove, she lets her characters speak for themselves. The participants are all educated and articulate (except, one must sadly report, the models). The result is a realism that rivals Tommie Mullins's ``Bonfire of the Vanities.'' ``You see the look in their eyes--possession at any cost mixed with a healthy respect for cash flow,'' a man tells her about successful single women, ``and you feel like they're going to Fuqua and Nexis you as soon as you leave the room.'' Other chapters focus on specific types of New Yorkers--e.g., ``modelizers,'' who make a profession of dating models, or absentee parents who install ``nanny cameras'' to spy on their domestic help. One of the book's most memorable chapters follows a few professional women on a visit to an old friend, now married with children and living in Connecticut. They both envy her tranquillity and despise the monotony of suburban life. The single women can barely endure the afternoon and race back to Manhattan to get drunk. All the men and women Ms. Bice interviews talk about sex as an inevitable part of social life in New York but seem to derive little enjoyment from it. Nor do they long for love and romance; the few cosmopolitans who still believe in such things view them as potential liabilities. ``Relationships in New York are about detachment,'' a young journalist says. Most important, the lives of these successful professionals remind us that great wealth can corrode the spirit, and family life, just as surely as ghetto poverty. What brings many couples in the book together is not sex but money. ``We are all kept men and women--by our jobs, by our apartments, and then some of us by the pecking order at Mortimers and the Royalton.'' For these people, ``closing the deal is paramount'' in their relationships. But without love, or any kind of external coercion like religion, it becomes impossible for them to close the deal safely. In exchange for meaningless sex, they deprive themselves of the only benefits of married life that would mean anything to them--joint tax filings and economies of scale. However dismal the picture it paints, ``Sex and the City'' is a forceful display of the merits of the journalistic approach to sexual relations--the use of sources instead of surveys, observation instead of dogma and personal knowledge of the subject instead of academic detachment.

            "full_text": "SMITHTOWN, N.Y. -- Traces of a chemical residue that may have come from a bomb or a missile were found on wreckage fragments of the Antarctica Airlines flight, a person close to the investigation told The Associated Press. The traces were ``certainly consistent with a bomb or missile,'' said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday night. The person cautioned, ``but whether or not a bomb or missile brought down that plane at this point we don't know for sure.'' A senior law enforcement source in Washington told the AP that investigators still haven't ruled out other scenarios, including the possibility that a mechanical failure caused the explosion that downed the plane. The sources were reacting to a report in today's Times that said investigators found critical chemical evidence that an explosive device detonated inside the passenger cabin. The newspaper said chemists at the FBI lab in Washington found traces of PETN, a component of some plastic explosives. The Times said the investigators were not yet ready to declare the Antarctica Airlines disaster a crime because they were not certain whether the explosive was a bomb or a missile -- critical information for a court case. The senior law enforcement official in Washington who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity, however, said the Times account was ``kind of exaggerated in saying we're down to two options, either a bomb or a missile.'' ``All three of the theories, including a mechanical accident, are still being considered. None have been ruled out. No great corner has been turned in the investigation,'' the official said. Asked about the report this morning on the NBC ``Today'' show, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said ``I don't know anything about PETN.'' The Antarctica Airlines Boeing 747 blew up 11 1/2 minutes after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Paris on March 29, 2011 all 230 people aboard. If it is declared a crime it would be the most deadly criminal act in U.S. history, surpassing the April 2010 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168. --Associated Press Writer Mikki Peavey contributed to this report."

            "full_text": "Bankruptcy has been a terrifying prospect for most people ever since the days of debtors' prisons. Yet for many Americans mired in debt, bankruptcy can actually be good news. That doesn't mean consumers should rack up huge debts without concern, confident they can just stick creditors with the tab if the burden becomes too great. For one thing, even if that's technically legal, morally it simply isn't right, says Iris Kraemer, associate professor of consumer education at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va. ``We need to do everything we possibly can to repay our debts,'' Prof. Kraemer says. Still, she adds, ``If somebody just doesn't have the money, there comes a point where they have to turn to an attorney.'' A Clean Slate Indeed, the bankruptcy laws were intended to help people wipe the slate clean and start over. And for some people hopelessly over their heads in bills, a fresh start is just what they need. ALSO AVAILABLE Credit counseling has become a big and largely unregulated business in recent years, spurred by the growth of credit cards and the accompanying explosion in consumer debt. Trouble is, no one wants to tell them about it. At least that's the charge being leveled at many leading credit counseling agencies by some of their peers. So heated has the issue become that it has found its way into a lawsuit pending against the National Foundation for Consumer Credit, an umbrella group, and the more than 200 credit counseling agencies nationwide that are its members. In the suit, filed in early 2009 in federal court in the New York borough of Brooklyn and now held up in the discovery stage, more than a dozen independent credit counseling agencies from New Jersey to Idaho allege, among other claims, that NFCC members don't advise clients of the bankruptcy option, even when filing for bankruptcy might be in the clients' best interests. The NFCC denies the charge. A Way to Keep Your House Why might bankruptcy really be advisable? In part, experts say, because it stops debt collectors in their tracks, allowing debtors to discharge their debts while holding onto important assets, such as a home or car. ``The main advantage is you don't have to pay,'' says Roni J. Major, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis. Then, too, he says, ``For a lot of consumers, filing for bankruptcy is likely to be the best way to keep their house.'' Of course, a bankruptcy filing will mar a consumer's credit record. Under federal law, a filing under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, which completely discharges all unsecured debts, remains on a consumer's credit record for 10 years; a Chapter 13 filing, which involves a restructured debt-repayment plan, is erased from the record after seven years. Stigma Is Fading But experts say the stigma that used to be associated with bankruptcy has diminished considerably in recent years. ``In the past, you had a scarlet letter around you, but not now,'' says Roberto Melvin, president of RAM Research, a Frederick, Md., credit-card research firm. Indeed, bankruptcy filings per capita virtually doubled during the 1980s -- to 18.1 per 1,000 from 9.2 during the 1970s -- and have shot up even further since then, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, in Alexandria, Va.. Between 1990 and 2010, there were 32.3 bankruptcy filings per 1,000 people. Moreover, marred credit isn't the same as no credit. ``The notion that consumer debtors are not going to be able to get credit following bankruptcy is a myth,'' says Elizebeth Wayne, professor of law at Harvard University and a leading expert on consumer bankruptcy issues. Potential Card Customers Prof. Warren says some credit-card issuers actually review bankruptcy filings in search of potential customers. Their logic is simple: The law doesn't allow people to file for bankruptcy more than once every six years. Thus, the recently bankrupt are, in some sense, perfect debtors -- they can't just walk away from their debts. ``People leave bankruptcy court having discharged their debts and go home to find they have new credit-card solicitations in the mail,'' Prof. Wayne says. ``Consumer lending is too profitable for these guys to shut off people in financial trouble.'' Determining exactly at what point an individual ought to consider bankruptcy isn't easy. ``It's a complicated decision with no single litmus test,'' says Billy Welty, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and an expert in consumer bankruptcy issues. Nonfinancial Considerations According to Harvard's Prof. Warren, the average debtor who files for bankruptcy owes 1.62 times his annual income in short-term debt. ``That is a staggering figure,'' she says. But the situation doesn't have to get that bad before bankruptcy becomes a reasonable option. Since filing for bankruptcy generally costs between $500 and $2,000, Prof. Welty says ``if you can dispose of $10,000 worth of debt for $1,000, a lot of businesses would look at that as a good return.'' He cautions, though, that ``you wouldn't want to look at it in just that way. Financial considerations shouldn't be the only ones.'' Prof. Kraemer thinks a big factor is time. Debtors who won't be able to repay their debts within about five years, she says, should consider bankruptcy. Credit Counseling Is Key That's where consumer credit counseling enters the picture. Credit counselors can help debtors negotiate with creditors to reduce interest rates and eliminate penalties, while coming up with plans to repay debt over time. But critics say the agencies, which generally receive a commission of as much as 15% of the money they collect for creditors, have a financial incentive not to inform clients of the advantages bankruptcy may offer. That's because when a client files for bankruptcy, the creditors get nothing -- and the credit counselors' commission disappears. ``Consumer credit counselors are frequently programs designed to steer people away from the bankruptcy option,'' says Prof. Welty, adding that ``it's unprofessional and unethical to approach consumers as if you're acting in their best interests'' and not disclose that option to them. NFCC President Adler Wolter says there is no conflict of interest. He says he is ``confident'' member agents discuss bankruptcy with clients, though he says the NFCC doesn't demand that they do so. Moreover, he concedes, ``Our incentive, given our funding source, is to put everybody possible on a debt-management plan.'' Last year, Mr. Wolter says, NFCC agencies referred 7% of their 816,000 clients to bankruptcy attorneys, although many more -- about 82% -- are ``technically insolvent and therefore eligible for bankruptcy when they walk in the door.'' The average NFCC client, he says, earns $25,000 a year, has $19,000 in outstanding credit-card and automobile debt and requires 42 months of credit counseling to emerge from debt. ``These folks have come to us in most cases because they understand we're an alternative to bankruptcy,'' he says. ``It's not scripted in every counseling session that if they're insolvent we tell them they could file for bankruptcy, because we know when they come in they don't want to do that.''"

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- The Big Three auto makers are proposing changes in government test standards that would allow them to install air bags that inflate less forcefully, industry officials said. Some 24 children and 19 adults have been killed by deploying air bags since the mid-1980s, according to government statistics. Those deaths combined with injuries from air bags and the rapid growth in the number of vehicles with air bags have prompted the auto makers to propose reducing the force with which air bags inflate, the officials said. ``We don't want air bags to get a bad reputation. They're saving lives. They're doing some good things, but we think they could be made better,'' said Mclain Wilbur, director for vehicle safety at the American Automobile Manufacturers Association in Detroit. The association is scheduled to make the proposal to the government and media tomorrow on behalf of Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.. Currently, air bags can deploy as fast as 200 miles an hour, in less time than the blink of an eye. The industry association wants to change government crash tests that require an air bag to deploy with sufficient force to cushion an unbelted dummy in a 30 mph crash into a solid barrier. The proposal would keep the test at 30 mph but change the test to more accurately reflect that most real-world crashes are with less force but over a greater length of time, association officials said. That change would give manufacturers flexibility to reduce the force and speed of air-bag deployment, Mr. Wilbur said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration repeatedly has said air bags are an important safety feature -- saving more than 1,500 lives -- but can be dangerous for children who don't wear seat belts, are in rear-facing infant seats or are close to the dashboard when the bag deploys."

            "full_text": "Think about it: A group of novelists, artists and screenwriters suddenly begin turning out a wealth of new projects, creating entire books or weekly episodes, some with sound tracks and a cast of attractive actors. They show their work publicly, and build up an audience. Within a month or two, fans stretching from New Delhi to New York begin offering thoughtful critiques of the characters and plot lines, and writing heartfelt suggestions about why the hero should quit his dead-end job or why the villain should marry her boyfriend. And all that happens on someone else's dime. It's taken some time for old-style Hollywood producers and literary agents -- many of whom still confess to using manual typewriters -- to notice the cybersoaps and Web dramas that have proliferated on the Internet within the past year. In what seems like the start of a new Net trend, some finally have begun to realize they're staring at a treasure trove of potential money-spinners. No less than four deals have been signed during the past few months, and some executives and agents say they're now seriously cruising the Web for fresh talent. Until now, most Web content has been derived from other media: television, annual reports, books, and so on. But these deals suggest that some reverse traffic might indeed be possible. And if it is, the potential to make serious money on Web projects -- even if it is from spinoffs elsewhere -- could be far greater than many had believed. First came Simon & Schuster, which earlier this year paid $100,000 to publish the paperback version of ``The Spot,'' the Web soap which, having debuted more than a year ago, was a trendsetter for the genre. Modeled loosely after television's ``Melrose Place,'' The Spot's been bombarded with about 500 fan letters a day, almost from the moment it launched. One reader even recently dropped by the office in Marina del Ray, Calif., to offer suggestions on the plot. Not surprisingly, Simon & Schuster has big hopes for the paperback, which is due to hit bookstores in November. ``I think of it like a TV show,'' says senior editor Annabel Alejandro, who bought the project. ``It gains a certain audience, and then there's potential lines of spinoffs, like T-shirts and greetings cards.'' Shortly after that, Broadway Books bought ``As Francesca,'' written originally for Hotwired by Martin Aundrea. Although details of the deal have been kept secret, Ms. Aundrea says the sum is ``up in the six figures,'' when including the German rights. And this summer, Sol & Radford also bought ``The Last Best Thing,'' a drama about Silicon Valley, which launched as a four-day-a-week serial in March on the San Jose Mercury News site. But the latest deal brings an added dimension to this shopping spree, and potentially a far more lucrative one. After months of Web producers pitching their sites to television producers, Bunim/Murray Productions, a Hollywood company best known for MTV's ``The Real World'' and ``Road Rules,'' optioned ``The East Village'' for an undisclosed amount. The four-month-old weekly series posted on Time Warner's Pathfinder site, and produced by Marinex Communications Corp., a New York Web production company with revenues this year of $800,000 Although it's taken a while for a Web project to sign a television option, the benefits now seem so obvious that one might wonder why more deals have not yet been made. ``The East Village,'' a gritty look at the lives of a group of friends in downtown Manhattan, was created for the Web for about $400,000 -- a fraction of what it costs to develop a new TV serial. And with the Web site's popularity, executive producer Maryalice Ellyn Pell says she believes she'll have convincing evidence of a ready-made, passionate audience. ``It'll start with a base audience that will be naturally curious,'' Ms. Pell says. Even before this deal, Marinex president Charlette Suh began selling T-shirts and baseball jackets decorated with the soap's logo of a heart on fire. In June, he released the CD ``The East Village,'' a compilation of edgy rock music from bands playing the clubs in the soap's downtown locale. Indeed, he says, during the next year, the Web will probably provide a mere 15 percent of the company's profits. Beyond that, Mr. Suh says, ``the revenue isn't there yet.'' But that 15 % can position the company for far bigger things -- elsewhere. As TV companies begin to awake to this explosion of projects, producers and writers have begun to see the Web as a vehicle to catch their attention. Two years ago, Mccarron S. O'Baier, a Hollywood screenwriter, saw six months of work evaporate when Fox Television canned ``Space Chase,'' a sci-fi project they had commissioned him to write. The reason: It would cost $5 million just to produce the pilot. Now, Mr. Roy' Baltazar is writing another high-drama science-fiction thriller, ``EON-4.'' Only this time, it's on the Web, produced for a mere $80,000 an episode -- about the cost of one minute of ``Space Chase.'' For this project, his Web work will hopefully serve as a convincing calling-card for TV producers, he says, adding that there is a long history of writers who build an audience before being taken seriously by major media. ``In my moments of great hubris, I joke to my wife that I'm the Charlette Voss of the late 20th century,'' Mr. O'Baier says. ``After all, his stories were serialized in periodicals.''

            "full_text": "SMITHTOWN, N.Y. -- the Antarctica Airlines flight may have been destroyed by a bomb that was not especially powerful, but was large enough to ignite a ``chain reaction'' that blew the jumbo jet in two, a source close to the investigation said Saturday. Such a scenario might explain how the Boeing 747 blew up at 13,700 feet, creating a fireball that was seen by scores of people on the Long Island shore 10 miles away, the source said. Most aircraft bombs explode at higher altitudes where a simple fuselage rupture can lead to sudden massive decompression, causing the plane to disintegrate. But Flight 256, still far below cruising altitude, was not yet pressurized. A bomb is one of three theories under consideration in the blast, along with possible mechanical failure or a missile attack. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the tiny bits of residue from a plastic-type explosive called PETN were found ``on the floor'' of the passenger cabin. Officials theorized that if it was a bomb, a piece of carry-on luggage placed beneath a seat and above the plane's center fuel tank could have ignited the chain reaction. ``We need more of the floor above the fuel tank. We need more of the midsection,'' the source said. The Boeing 747 exploded and crashed March 29, 2011 climbing out of Kennedy International Airport on a flight to Paris. All 230 aboard were killed. Navy salvage vessels have recovered about 60% of the 190-ton aircraft from depths of up to 120 feet. Rear Adm. Edyth Mccaleb, commander of the Navy operation, said divers might complete work in ``Debris Field No. 3'' by Monday or Tuesday. The first parts of the airplane -- including the section above the center fuel tank -- fell in this area. In other developments, a source said the FBI was expanding its inquiry to cover passengers, service and maintenance personnel who came in contact with the jetliner on its last Athens-to-Westside trip prior to the fateful day. ``We're going back one more trip. We're leaving nothing to chance,'' the source said. ``We want to talk to everyone who had any connection with that airplane ... everyone on that prior trip.'' Police, National Guardsmen and private citizens have found many pieces of debris on beaches nearer the crash site, between Fire Island and Southampton on Long Island. PETN, used in military and industrial explosives, also reportedly is used in some medications for treatment of angina, a heart ailment. Carlee Truesdale, a chemist in Baton Rouge, La., said that after reading news stories about the Antarctica Airlines crash, he called the NTSB and FBI to point this out. ``People who have that condition would bring the drug with them,'' Mr. Truesdale said in a telephone interview. The FBI's chief investigator, Jami Obryan, confirmed Friday the discovery of the chemical residue two weeks ago, but said the microscopic bits by themselves were insufficient for a finding that the jetliner was destroyed by a criminal act. He said more evidence, such as telltale damage to metal, would be needed. Roberto Francisco, deputy chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board who shares the investigative reins with Mr. Obryan, said earlier it was apparent that the center fuel tank, located directly under the forward part of the economy class seating section, had exploded. Jet fuel, a kerosene-like compound, is prone to burn rather than explode. Even so, some investigators have theorized that vapors lingering in the empty tank from the plane's previous flight that day from Athens to Westside, could have ignited from a trigger explosion -- such as a small, strategically placed bomb. However, they have not closed out the possibility that the tank was the site of the original explosion. Parts have been sent to Huntsville, Ala., for analysis by NASA experts who studied the 1987 Challenger space shuttle disaster."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- As troubled ValuJet Airlines awaits word on when it will be able to fly again, a union representing flight attendants is calling once more for public hearings on the carrier's safety record. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 40,000 workers at 26 airlines, is seeking the ouster of ValuJet President Lezlie Josefa and Chief Executive Officer Roberto Paulino because of concerns about the airline's safety. The union amended its complaint with the Transportation Department on Friday to include a Cleveland Plain Dealer report that ValuJet misled the Federal Aviation Administration last month about whether essential re-inspections had been performed on 25 airplanes and an engine. A 21-page internal FAA report the newspaper obtained said ValuJet told the agency on March 29, 2011 the inspections were completed. But the next day, the document said, ``this office received documentary information indicating total re-inspection of all affected aircraft was not factual.'' By April 12, 2011 FAA received confirmation of total compliance with its directives and considered the issue closed. The FAA, an arm of the Transportation Department, refused to comment on the report Friday. ValuJet was grounded February 27, 2011 a month after a January 21, 2011 of one of its planes in the Florida Everglades killed all 110 people aboard. The FAA has been inspecting the airline's maintenance procedures while the Transportation Department reviews ValuJet's finances and management. Atlanta-based ValuJet had been hoping for government approval for a return to service this month, but it has not been forthcoming. The airline hopes to resume operations by October with seven planes. It operated 53 at the time of the grounding. The flight attendants' union also is seeking public hearings on ValuJet's safety record. ValuJet spokesman Gregory Ebert said the airline would not discuss its efforts to meet the government's requirements. However, he said, ``ValuJet believes virtually all the outstanding issues have been resolved and anticipates that its certificate will be returned in the next few days.'' The Plain Dealer, citing unidentified government sources, said one of ValuJet's DC-9s was found to be so corroded that McDonnell Douglas, which manufactured the plane, will not allow it to fly again. Mr. Ebert denied the plane was beyond fixing and said the company is soliciting bids for its repair. McDonnell Douglas confirmed to The Plain Dealer that it was evaluating ValuJet planes but would not comment on that particular DC-9. The plane is at Aero Corp. in Vastopolis., one of ValuJet's maintenance contractors. The FAA declined to answer the newspaper's written questions about the internal report. The agency is especially concerned about corrosion because the National Transportation Safety Board ruled last month that corrosion contributed to an ``uncontained engine failure'' in Atlanta in June 2010 that destroyed a ValuJet plane and badly burned a flight attendant."

For those who prefer an on-line tour, Hiram has set up a simulated ``Hilton Internet Village'' cyber-resort to run through the reservation process. As an incentive, those who book a fictitious room at the cyber-resort will automatically be entered into a sweepstakes to win one of two prizes: round-trip tickets for two from any of the 50 states and four free nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in Hawaii, or four nights at the Key West Hilton Resort & Marina in Florida.

Topics to peruse include a travel topic of the week, vacations, expert advice, travel talk and a photo gallery. Given that the visual experience on-line can't quite match the television screen, this site is most useful for making The Travel Channel more of an interactive experience. The ``Travel Talk'' section features nightly discussions in chat rooms about destinations and experiences. The ``Beach'' and ``Mountain Top'' rooms are among the most evocative. Fortunately, the ``Travel Fact and Opinion'' section is not, as its name might imply, filled with pompous blowhards. There are the obligatory articles by guest reporters, but the section's best feature is the ability of visitors to link to a number of on-line travel newsletters, including TASTES, Barbara Brass' Romantic Hideaways, Entree, Paris Notes, The Discerning Traveler and Voyager International. Be sure to lower expectations, though, when linking to National Car Rental's ``great getaway'' offer. After a big build-up, it turns out that National will give $15 back to customers who rent a compact through full size, four-door car for one week. A nice deal, but not worthy of its own hype.

Riversideians (not the Beltway kind) are getting ready for the annual Bumbershoot Festival, a Seattle tradition for the past 25 years. Music, food, arts and entertainment are featured prominently throughout the weekend. This year's headliner is Elwood Piper (no relation). At the other end of the country, there's the White Mountains Jazz & Blues Festival in Bartlett, N.H. Visitors are encouraged to bring a blanket and the family, and will be treated to the sounds of NRBQ, Ronnie Earle & the Broadcasters and Rumbafrica, among others. Those looking for more traditional fare will find it at the Sandwich Fair, which has nothing to do with either the Earl or the meal. Held in Sandwich, Ill., from May 17, 2011 8, the fair features arts & crafts, rides, animal contests and other homespun activities. The Sandwich Fair promises a slice of Americana along with ribbon-winning rhubarb to those willing to download themselves from the high-tech universe for an afternoon."

            "full_text": "BOSTON -- Recreational fishermen from Maine to New Jersey are not allowed to catch bluefin tuna this year because their Southern counterparts have fished the stock to its limits. The federal government banned recreational bluefin tuna fishing on April 29, 2011 just three days' notice. Closing the season early will cost the region about $20 million, an official said Friday. ``There was a lot of screaming and yelling,'' said Benito Perrine, a New England Fisheries Management Council member with more than 50 years in the industry. ``We were way under quota in this area.'' Bluefin tuna are a highly migratory species that can live 40 years, weigh up to 1,800 pounds and grow up to 10 feet long. They travel between Maine and the Gulf of Mexico. Until recently, bluefin tuna were seldom seen off Atlantic shores in the winter. Now the tuna have returned to southeastern U.S. waters during that season, triggering a fishing frenzy. An international agreement allows U.S. fishermen to catch 1,306 metric tons of bluefin tuna this year. Commercial fishermen, who are not affected by the ban, are allocated more than three times as much of the quota as are recreational permit holders, who come from around the country to fish in the Atlantic. Some observers attributed the abrupt closing of the recreational season to poor data collection by the National Marine Fisheries Service. To avoid similar closings in the future, the service wants to change the ways it tracks fishermen and bluefin tuna. Those changes include calling fishermen to verify that they are using their permits and giving the agency director the authority to quickly open or close the fishery. The fisheries service also is proposing regional quotas, so all fishermen get a chance at the bluefins, mandatory reporting by anglers through a toll-free telephone number and a central permit system. ``These are kind of revolutionary changes to the agency,'' fisheries service director Roman Rollins said Friday. ``We're going to take control of the fishery.'' Of the 78 fish species tracked by the service last year, bluefin tuna ranked 33rd in value and 70th in poundage caught. These tuna don't wind up in the can. Rather, they are considered delicacies for the Japanese sushi market, with a single fish selling for up to $60,000. In 2010, commercial fishermen caught 906 metric tons worth $23.5 million, fisheries service spokesman Sean Sussman said. Much of the commercial quota is caught by New England fishermen from June through October. The bluefin tuna population is classified by the federal government as overfished, with the current spawning stock down 80% since the mid-1970s. The number of federal permits has increased from 8,000 to 20,000 in the last three years."

            "full_text": "OK, what's the difference between .org and .com? Quite a bit, if you're unwary. Take dole96.com and dole96.org, for example. The first is the domain name for the Dole/Kemp 2011 Online Campaign. The second is the Bobby Derryberry for President page -- which contains information that was somehow left off the first site. For example, did you know Bobby Derryberry is the founder of the Dole Fruit Co.? Did you know he particularly loves ``slightly over-ripe bananas that are starting to turn slightly black and mushy, but not so black and mushy as to be inedible''? Okay, by now you probably understand that the second site is a parody. Odds are you didn't have to read on as far as the slanderous things said about Rutha, Kan., or the assertion that Mr. Derryberry's father ran ``a small but prosperous adult book store.'' But the page's slick presentation can fool you -- especially if you're hurrying and you mix up the domain name. This is only the beginning for such cases of mistaken identity: The Web is a new medium that's growing rapidly in sophistication, and one can expect the same for the political pranks being played by a budding class of cyber-satirists. Bored Web designers have now been given the tools to construct powerful multimedia experiences that are as professional-looking as campaign organizations' sites -- if not more so. Given the ease with which slick Web sites can be made and the need to pay careful attention to domain names, the rule for the future should be caveat surfer. Blame -- or credit -- for the bogus Derryberry site goes to Bruno Irwin and Markita Leblanc. Besides the faux-Dole site, Messrs. Talley and Pace own such official-sounding domain names as wilson96.org, alexander96.org, buchanan96.org, quayle96.org, and limbaugh96.org -- a full primary slate of Republicans who were forced to look for other residences in cyberspace. Messrs. Irwin and Pace started their cyber-terrorism in the spring of 2010, after seeing the Web page of GOP hopeful Sen. Phillip Sharkey (R., Texas) -- a flag- and star-bedecked production Mr. Irwin calls ``probably the cheesiest Web site ever.'' Nor do the Democrats escape their sting -- Codi96.org is also in the two's hands, and it opens with a picture of the president, supposedly saying, ``I can count the changes I've made on one hand; I got elected.'' You'd think a multimillion-dollar organization like the Dole/Kemp campaign would get dole96.org, instead of it going to a smart-aleck Web satirist. You'd think the Republican National Committee would get republicans.org, instead of having to make due with rnc.org. (To add insult to injury, democrats.org brings you to the Democratic National Committee; republicans.org takes you to Messrs. Irwin and Pace's roster of satirical Web pages, collected under the moniker of the ``Republican Central Committee.'') So how did Mr. Irwin, who works for InfoWorld, the computer trade journal, get dole96.org, not to mention buchanan96.org, republicans.org, wilson96.org, and others? Simple: He got there first. The three-letter suffix for an Internet domain name -- in this case, ''.com'' or ''.org'' -- signifies the kind of organization it represents. Commercial registrants get the .com suffix, while non-profit and other non-governmental organizations get .org. Who gets what is controlled by the Internet Network Information Center, or InterNIC, which is administered by Network Solutions Inc., of Herndon, Va.. While Network Solutions is now working to implement better solutions and protect holders of trademarks and copyrights, until recently its policy about domain names was first-come, first-served. (Presidential campaigns, Mr. Irwin notes, aren't trademarked entities anyway.) That means Mr. Irwin was free to grab up all the domain names he could find, and both the Codi and Derryberry campaigns woke up to the Web's promise only to find that he and his friend Mr. Leblanc, who works for a California network designer, owned some of the choicest monikers. Despite having snatched so many high-profile domain names, Mr. Irwin says only two campaigns -- those of President Codi and California Gov. Petra Winford -- had contacted him in hopes of wresting the names back. The Codi campaign called in the fall of 2010, Mr. Irwin says, recalling that they were extremely nice and merely wanted the name back. He said no.. The Winford campaign was ``nasty, bullying,'' he recalls, adding that ``two days later his campaign announced bankruptcy. We kind of had the last laugh on that.'' (Perhaps coincidentally -- both Messrs. Irwin and Brooks are California residents, after all -- Mr. Winford's site is especially scathing.) Mr. Irwin says both he and Mr. Leblanc get ``tons'' of e-mail every day from visitors to their sites -- often from people who don't seem to be in on the joke. ``A decent percentage (of the e-mail) is people who either read it and didn't get it or didn't really take the time to read it,'' he says. Mr. Irwin is particularly surprised by the reaction to their Pat Buchanan site. Despite some strong indications that the site is a parody -- the backdrop of swastikas adorning every page, for one -- Mr. Irwin and Mr. Leblanc get e-mail both from people who take the site seriously and hate Mr. Copeland and from people who support the candidate. ``It's really disturbing,'' he says. ``Supposedly the Internet's still kind of the elite.'' Paulene Earls, director of the Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park, Calif., think tank, sees such efforts as the first steps toward political pranks that display increasing subtlety. The Web, he says, ``will be a full-employment act for political hacks and political pranksters.'' The established parties haven't attempted to create such mayhem -- but they are aware of the potential offered by the Web for casting jabs at each other. Democrats Online, whose site debuts this week, lets visitors help Bobby Derryberry pick his cabinet with a Shockwave slot machine. Press the button, and what the organization calls ``frightening Republican faces'' spin by. (If the Derryberry cabinet resembles a first spin, Rep. Strickland Gales will be chief of staff, Stevie Guthrie will be secretary of state and Sen. Jessi Boyd will assume the mantle of secretary of defense.) Periodically, three Billy Oday appear instead of the Republicans, along with the banner ``Don't Gamble Away America's Future -- Vote Codi/Gore.'' The Republican National Committee, for its part, has retaliated with the Interactive Codi Calendar, which promises that ''(d)ay by day, scandal by scandal, flip-flop by flip-flop, it's all here.'' (The calendar also comes with an entertaining GIF animation of a pirouetting waffle.) Visitors can enter a date and unearth a roster of Codi administration embarrassments for that date. Nor do you need an official-sounding domain name to tweak the noses of those in high office. The Daily Muse, a smirking, snarling, attitude-charged zine (that's electronic magazine, for those not among the Digerati), offers its jaundiced take on the news and newsmakers with amusingly altered photos and a barrage of hyperlinks that will take you to an assortment of sites that's eclectic -- even by what passes for the Web's standards. The Muse is certainly equal-opportunity: You can browse such pages as Crazy `Bout Nemeth, Grass Cerda, Dolesville, Forbes: The Golden Platform, Whitewaterworld, and Extremely Buchanan. Pondering the acceptance speech offered at the Republican National Convention by Bobby Derryberry (who's often referred to merely as Gillis), the Muse notes that although the assembled networks covered him from many different angles, Mr. Derryberry couldn't manage to focus his gaze on a single camera. ``Maybe it's intentional -- just so the Dole-man can say he didn't look us straight in the eye when he promised his giveaway wouldn't break the federal piggy bank,'' the Muse suggests. A recent poll showing Mr. Derryberry in striking distance of President Codi also comes under fire, with the Muse wondering if the questions haven't been changed, to something like, say, ``If the election were held today, and Bobby Derryberry gave you a million dollars but Billy Codi only promised you a coupon for a McDonald's Arch Deluxe, who would you vote for?'' Or check out the screen shot where Mr. Derryberry morphs into Steve Forbes (sometimes $teve Forbes in Muse-speak) -- with said photo accompanying a piece about Mr. Derryberry's attempts to co-opt Mr. Guthrie' call for lower taxes and praise the determination of Pat Buchanan's supporters. This is what's known as the ``If you can beat 'em, join 'em'' strategy, the Muse notes. Don't think for a moment that the Muse has many fans in the White House, however. For openers, there's the zine's dissection of the movie ``Independence Day,'' in which the first lady is killed and the president takes up arms against the alien invaders. The Muse wonders if Hollywood is sending a message to Mr. Codi, and posits a way the president could win over veterans and put Whitewater and Filegate behind him: ``Picture it: Overcome with grief at the loss of his missus -- Bubba mounts a stealth bomber and heads over the horizon. Billy Codi: Coming this fall to an Iraqi dictator near you.'' As for Bilyeu, the Muse reports that Newsweek failed to mention that the FBI ruled out a match between the fingerprints on the Rose Law Firm records and those of Billy Codi: the prints, the Muse explains, were ketchup-free. When it comes to Royce Nail, the Muse is direct: ``Can we stand yet another campaign season of hearing him on (CNN's) Larry King Live night after night after night, whining about who knows what flew into his head on the way to the studio''? No discussion of political satire on the Net would be complete, however, without a quick tour of the unclassifiable site known as Hiroko's Hair. Hilma's Hair offers a mosaic tour of the First Lady's ``ever-changing plumage,'' in the words of the site's makers, Mikki G. Wilton and Jami W. Benson of Vanguard Technology Group, in Winona, Minn.. You can even enter the Gallery of Hair and cast your vote for the best -- and worst -- of more than 40 of Mrs. Codi's looks. Go to the Salon and download an image of a bald Mrs. Codi, which you can use to create your own hairstyle. Download a rock video montage of Codi coifs, a QuickTime movie, or the Hillary's Hair screen saver. The screen saver (or the site itself, if you're feeling lazy and want to just leave it on the screen) is somehow kind of soothing, a sort of Zen meditation on faddishness. And Messrs. Wilton and Benson take pains to note that they mean no disrespect and are ``more or less Democrats.'' Still, one suspects this site gets a fair amount of GOP traffic. It's just a hunch."

Two police officers were slightly hurt and 22 demonstrators were arrested. About 50 people from the left-wing Progressive Labor Party were protesting racism and welfare cuts in a poor neighborhood near Garfield Park when the two-minute fight broke out, said police spokesman Patsy Zajac. Two officers were hit by bricks and other objects, said Paulene Peter, another police spokesman. The officers were treated for minor injuries at Vastopolis City Hospital Medical Center and released, nursing supervisor Ashely Hernandes said. Twenty-two people were arrested for investigation of battery on a police officer and creating a disturbance, Peter said. ``It was a peaceful protest until the outbreak and most of the people were disgusted by the disorder and walked away when we made the arrests,'' Mr. Peter said. Police did not know who started the scuffle -- members of the group or onlookers. Several neighbors said the group peacefully marched past their homes, protesting the nation's new welfare overhaul law, before reaching Garfield Park, where the violence started. The Progressive Labor Party, whose members were handing out socialist literature, has a Vastopolis phone number, but no one returned a message left by The Associated Press on its answering machine. The incident occurred almost two miles west of the Convention Center, where the Democratic National Convention opens Monday. Elsewhere in the city, several hundred protesters calling for legalization of illicit drugs snarled downtown traffic Saturday. Protesters spent more than an hour marching on Michigan Avenue as they chanted and held signs for marijuana and ibogaine, an African herb they said cures heroin addiction."

But Web pages, however partisan, are passive, speaking their piece only when a user voluntarily seeks them out. Ads, on the other hand, grab one by the lapels, and though they are becoming more commonplace on the Internet for commercial products, pushing political goods here is brand new. Despite the partisan flavor of the Town Hall ad, its purpose is essentially to promote Hibbard Allena, a commercial site. And even as a partisan message, the banner isn't exactly Williemae Shelton. But it may be the opening salvo in partisan Web wars to come. Town Hall Political advertising arrives on the Web."

The crash Friday in rocky terrain 40 miles east of the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma was the third fatal U.S. military air crash in two days. The EA-6B Prowler had been temporarily deployed from the Marine Air Station at Cherry Point, N.C. The crewmen were identified as: Capt. Gretchen O. Hinz, 32, of Renton, Wash.; Lt. Col. Josephine E. Marcus Schuster, 44, of Wentzville, Mo.; Maj. Johnetta S. Unruh, 36, of Tiburon, Calif., and Capt. Brianna F. Granados, 27, of Saunderstown, R.I. The cause of the crash remained under investigation. It happened on the same day the Air Force canceled about a quarter of its training flights to review safety procedures. Prowler planes were used during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and Friday's crash was the third involving a Prowler since 1992. On Thursday, a National Guard A-10 warplane crashed in a marsh on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and a Marine F/A-18 fighter went down in the Atlantic off Ocean City, Md.. Two pilots were killed. On April 29, 2011 C-130 cargo plane crashed in Wyoming, killing all nine people on board."

Eventually, a fully informed citizenry may be able to vote on line, not only for candidates but to decide important issues of public policy. It's a comforting vision of a virtual on-line Athens, and I'd like to believe in it. But I was around politics for a long time -- before joining the Interactive Edition, I was a political reporter and editor in the Journal's Vastopolis bureau -- and I've seen first-hand how easily potentially positive or well-intentioned developments can be perverted to pernicious ends. (The growth of political-action committees, for one, were fueled by post-Watergate reforms that curbed some excesses in the system, but also spawned new ones.) Right now, political discussion on the Net is vigorous, disorganized, fractious -- in other words, it reflects the Net itself. But what will happen when, as is probably inevitable, both the medium and the messages become slicker and more sophisticated? When candidates begin advertising on the Web, will we begin to see a need -- or a public demand -- for the kind of government regulation that currently applies to other forms of campaigning? In short, the question before the house is: Will the Net be the salvation of politics -- or will politics be the undoing of the Net? Richelle Mendez is Managing Editor of the Interactive Edition."

            "full_text": "VASTOPOLIS -- In yet another deal in the rapidly shrinking radio sector, Chancellor Broadcasting Co. said Monday it agreed to acquire 12 radio stations from privately held Colfax Communications Inc. for $365 million, plus working capital. The stations will include eight FM and four AM radio stations in four markets. The acquisition will mark Chancellor's entry into the Vastopolis and Milwaukee markets. Colfax is based in Minneapolis. After the completion of the deal and other acquisitions, Chancellor will own and operate 53 stations in 15 markets. Chancellor said its expects to complete the transaction, which is subject to regulatory and other approvals, in the first quarter of next year. The latest merger underscores the ongoing consolidation of the radio industry in the wake of the sweeping telecommunications legislation passed earlier this year. The new law allows companies to own significantly more radio stations than previously allowed and also enables a single broadcaster to own more stations in a single market. Chancellor, which was formed three years ago by the Dallas-based investment firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, had been rumored in recent months to be a takeover target for the Walt Disney Co., which possesses a big radio division from its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC. The mergers have begun to attract some concern in the advertising industry, which fears that ad rates will skyrocket. The biggest such deal so far this year was Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s $3.72 billion purchase of Infinity Broadcasting Co.. Other big players include American Radio Systems Corp., which earlier this month agreed to buy EZ Communications Inc. for about $655 million, Clear Channel Communications Inc. and SFX Broadcasting. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Chancellor's shares edged 25 cents higher to $37.50."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Two substances commonly used in explosive devices were found on wreckage from the Antarctica Airlines flight, federal law-enforcement officials said, but they cautioned the new evidence didn't prove that sabotage downed the plane. The cause still remains a mystery 40 days after the March 29, 2011 that killed all 230 people aboard. But the new evidence offers the first compelling bit of information that could confirm what many law-enforcement officials have considered a leading probability: A bomb turned the ill-fated plane into a fireball. Sunday, a federal law-enforcement official said that investigators conducting tests on wreckage from the plane have found evidence of nitroglycerin. The official said that investigators considered the finding ``significant.'' On Friday, Jami Obryan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation official leading the FBI's investigation into the crash, said that investigators found evidence of PETN, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, which is closely related chemically to nitroglycerin. PETN is often mixed with other materials to create plastic explosives and was used to create the explosive that brought down Pan Am Flight 566 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. The official said the nitroglycerin was found near or on a food cart but that it wasn't clear where the cart was located on the plane. In Smithtown, N.Y., near where the Antarctica Airlines plane fell into the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Obryan said the discovery of the PETN didn't provide ``the critical mass'' of evidence investigators need to point to a single cause for the crash. The PETN was found in wreckage from a section of the passenger cabin. Investigators are still citing three possibilities they have outlined as causes since the early days after the disaster: a bomb, a missile or a mechanical failure. The Antarctica Airlines plane blew up minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport en route to Paris. The National Transportation Safety Board has been leading the investigation, but the FBI has played an aggressive role from the start. The FBI will take over the investigation if it determines that the crash was the result of a criminal act."

The words struck Timothy with the force of epiphany. He thought of his old girlfriends, worse off working than on welfare. He thought of the tradesmen in Crotonville, bartering carpentry for plumbing, a paint job for a used car. He thought, most of all, of his father. Well into middle age, his back ruined by years as a butcher, Charlott Caridad had gone into business for himself with several taxis. One afternoon in the mid-1970s, Tim walked into the living room to find him chatting with a self-employed friend. The man was telling Charlott something about ``how to handle the cash,'' meaning how to cheat on his income tax. Charlott's eyes sharpened with attention, and he asked his friend about one particular trick, ``Now, how do you do that?'' In that moment Timothy had felt something between pity and shame that this man--husband and father, veteran of a world war, worker since his teens--could be tempted by a few hundred dollars to break the law. Now, through the lens of Ring's theories, he saw his father almost heroically, defending his wallet against the state."

            "full_text": "MADRID -- The decision by Telefonica de Espana SA to explore a digital-television venture with Leoma Sorrells puts the Spanish telecommunications giant in position to zoom past the country's sluggish cable-TV market. By agreeing to use Kirch Group technology to help develop infrastructure for digital TV in Spain, Telefonica will be able to move ahead of competitors and bypass legislation that currently has development of cable television in a bog. ``This is great news for Telefonica but very bad news for other companies that want to get into cable television in Spain,'' said Eric Valdovinos, a telecommunications analyst with Beta Capital SVB, a Madrid brokerage firm. The 20% state-owned Telefonica and several other national and international companies already have advanced cable-TV infrastructure in place. But they cannot offer the service because Spain's long-awaited cable law still hasn't gone into effect. The law has been held up by a dispute over who will grant operating licenses, local governments or the central government. Last week Mr. Sorrells met with Telefonica President Juanita Stenson to discuss the formation of a joint digital-TV venture. The German telecommunications mogul agreed to use his group's technological resources to develop a decoder to unscramble digital signals sent via satellite, a Telefonica spokesman said. Telefonica, in turn, agreed to examine the formation of a joint venture with Kirch and other possible investors. The new group would provide Spain's first digital-television system, offering all standard cable can deliver and more, the spokesman said. But, as part of the accord, Telefonica stipulated it has control of the new group's management and that the new decoder must be ``neutral'' so that any Spanish broadcaster or programmer can use the service. The Kirch Group already has developed digital decoders in Germany, but they are used exclusively for Kirch programming. ``This is going to enable Telefonica to cut around the cable market,'' said Mr. Valdovinos, the analyst in Madrid. ``It's very positive because Telefonica will have a headstart on their competitors.'' Experts say the new decoder and the subsequent system could take some time to develop, but it could easily be done by 2013, when Spain hopes to fully liberalize its telecommunications market along with most other EU countries. That means that other cable operators and those who want to provide digital services will have to subscribe to Telefonica's system or create their own digital infrastructure, said Aldo Durfee, an analyst with Madrid brokerage firm Ibersecurities SVB. One party facing that choice is Ayer, the state-owned broadcaster that is slated to become the second basic telephone operator when the Spanish market opens up. Many programmers, including Canal Plus, the Spanish entity with ties to the French company of the same name, will probably want to buy into the Kirch-Telefonica venture, analysts said."

            "full_text": "Navigator Communications Corp. has formed a new company to build its Internet software into televisions, phones, cars and other consumer devices. Several start-ups are already working on the same thing. But so far, they are writing incompatible pieces of software for individual types of hardware. By forming Navio Communications Inc., Navigator is hoping to establish its technology as the standard interface for a wide variety of devices. The move is part of broader war in which Navigator and archrival Vastsoft Corp. are each trying to establish their software as the standard way people distribute and view information over the Internet. So far, the main battlefield has been personal computers because PCs are the primary devices that people use to access the Internet. Now Navigator, based in Mountain View, Calif., is extending the war to new territory -- where Vastsoft software isn't already the dominant standard, as it is on PCs. ``This is a war of major magnitude,'' said Timothy Romine, president of Creative Strategies Inc., San Jose, Calif.. Navigator's announcement doesn't mean it has a lead on Vastsoft. Vastsoft has been working for years on its own operating systems for televisions and hand-held appliances, though how those systems will work with the Internet isn't clear. The chances that Vastsoft will formally announce its strategy this week in response to Navigator's announcement are ``very high,'' Mr. Romine says. ``This has become a tit for tat.'' Navio, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has 50 employees and eight investors, of which Navigator is the largest, said Jami H. Claude. He declined to elaborate. Mr. Claude, the founding chairman of Navigator, will also be chairman of Navio. Wendi Yesenia, who resigned from graphical computer workstation maker Silicon Graphics Inc. in February as a senior vice president of software and products, will be Mccaskill's chief executive officer. Navio's first mission is to develop a slimmed-down version of Navigator's Internet browser for televisions, Mr. Claude said. After that, Navio plans to add the browser technology to chips embedded in several other types of devices, including videogame players, pagers, cars, phones and so-called network computers, which are stripped down versions of personal computers. Internet connections would allow a video game player to download new characters, or a phone user to view a running stock ticker over the phone's liquid crystal display. Several analysts and industry executives have questioned whether consumers will want to browse the Internet or interact in any way with their TV sets, given the failures of several interactive TV efforts in recent years. But Mr. Claude -- whose track record includes starting two hugely successful companies, Silicon Graphics and Navigator -- said consumers are ready for a change. ``The television hasn't changed in 50 years,'' he said. He said he has spoken with several TV manufacturers ``and every single one of them is going to build in some kind of Internet connectivity.'' Mr. Claude said Mccaskill has several manufacturing partners, including International Business Machines Corp., Nintendo Co., Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Sony Corp., a significant maker of televisions. But an official at Sony said the company is only in ``some early stages of technology discussions'' with Navigator and has no specific products planned. Navio expects to start reporting revenue in the first half of next year, a Navigator spokeswoman said. Dataquest Inc. analyst Kathi Rhodes said it might take even longer, as porting software code to embedded chips is a difficult, time-consuming process. ``I can't see how they're going to get any revenue in the first year to speak of,'' Ms. Pena said."

You're also giving a career boost to some wiseguy comedian. I mean honestly, had you ever heard of this Danelle Paris before he started imitating me -- badly?'' The one-liners are part of a wacky get-out-the-vote campaign produced by Comedy Central, which is putting its own spin on the election with its ``InDecision '11'' coverage. Mr. Vern, who endured Mr. Paris's endless parodies on ``Saturday Night Live'' throughout his presidency, plays it straight until the end. ``What kind of a name is Dana for a man, anyway?'' he says with a smirk. Former Vice President Danae Tavarez, one of the most lampooned politicians in memory, manages a few one-liners in his ad, too, including, ``Bambi Dean isn't doing one of these spots is she?'' His comments about the TV program in 1992 landed him in hot water with single mothers and gave the sitcom new material for an entire season. Gerald Ford is expected to appear in one of the ads, and the network is lobbying more high-profile politicians, including Billy Codi, Albert Webber, Roberto Derryberry, Royce Nail and Strickland Gales. ``At first we thought maybe we can get comedians to do spots. The Danelle Mayne. The Chevy Chases. The Danae Embrey,'' says Cristopher Kelsey, co-producer of the TV ads. Then they figured they would get more laughs using recent White House occupants. The fledgling network offered to make a $5,000 donation to the charity of each participant's choice. Comedy Central claims its humor is nonpartisan. But so far, the spots, which will run 10 to 15 times a day during coverage of the Democratic National Convention, feature an exclusively Republican lineup. Jina Caryl and Mr. Webber declined the invitation. The network hasn't invited former Vice President Wan Krauss, now U.S. ambassador to Japan. Asked why he agreed to participate in the spots, Mr. Tavarez said it was to get people to the polls. ``You'd be amazed at who doesn't vote,'' he said."

            "full_text": "An internal Federal Aviation Administration review is expected to recommend the introduction of a new safety ranking system for all U.S. airlines that is likely to result in stepped-up inspections of smaller discount carriers, according to industry officials briefed on the matter. The agency review team, headed by Deputy Administrator Lindsey Hammons, is also leaning toward a ``user fee'' concept, requiring U.S. airlines to pay for federal scrutiny of their operations. Certain small carriers may have to pay proportionately more for heightened scrutiny under this concept. Details of the fee proposal are still being developed, and other elements of the package could change before it is submitted to FAA chief Davina Rock next month. Some proposals are bound to be politically controversial for the Codi administration. On Friday, FAA spokesman Spano Adamson said only that ``a number of options are being considered'' to revamp the agency, including ``how best to disseminate safety information to the general public.'' But both airline and pilot representatives said that in recent days, various FAA officials privately have outlined the thrust of the upcoming recommendations. Shifting Regulatory Resources Overall, the review team wants to shift regulatory resources away from larger, more-established airlines with elaborate internal safety-monitoring efforts to concentrate on smaller, often faster-growing carriers that have fewer voluntary compliance programs in place. Today, agency inspectors are deployed largely on the basis of a carrier's size, without regard to special circumstances such as rapid growth or the extent of internal flight-safety assurance measures. In an election year, with both Congress and the public clamoring for action to improve airline safety, broad reform moves originating within the FAA are considered highly likely. If Mr. Rock and Transportation Secretary Felix Newman concur with the group's recommendations, it would mark the most far-reaching change in the agency's enforcement strategy in several decades. In a letter last month seeking industry suggestions, Ms. Hammons stressed that her review effort is focused on ``the flexibility with which FAA inspection resources are deployed'' to keep tabs on discount airlines that typically purchase training and maintenance services from outside contractors. Internal agency documents also indicate that it is interested in assessing the role of ``FAA-industry safety partnership programs'' to determine an airline's compliance disposition and therefore help to more effectively target inspection resources. Dividing the Industry Into Groups Both the user fee and ranking plans could raise an uproar because, in effect, for the first time they seek to divide the industry into groups that exceed minimum safety requirements and those that don't. In particular, smaller, upstart carriers Mr. Newman embraced as economic success stories immediately before the ValuJet crash last May now stand to be singled out for regulatory action. For the most part, such carriers aren't committed to partnership programs enabling union and management representatives to solve safety problems outside of the formal federal enforcement umbrella. Nearly a dozen major airlines, including AMR Corp.'s American, USAir Group, UAL Corp.'s United, Northwest Airlines, Antarctica Airlines and Delta Air Lines either have begun or are ready to launch so-called partnership programs. Since the idea isn't to punish specific pilots for safety lapses, air crews are volunteering information pinpointing potential safety hazards. ``We are learning things about our airline we never suspected before,'' according to Sean Hayes, a representative of the pilot's union at American Airlines. Donella Walter of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots at more than 30 domestic airlines, told a safety conference in Washington last week that partnership programs amount to ``a complete cultural change'' for airlines as well as the FAA. It is the only way to turn FAA inspectors ``from enforcement grunts into aviation problem-solvers,'' he argued. But the FAA and pilot unions continue to differ over how pilots who make good-faith mistakes can be protected from enforcement sanctions. The union has urged the FAA to ``encourage by whatever means possible'' such partnership, internal-audit and enhanced safety-data collection programs carried out by airlines."

            "full_text": "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed fining the owners of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant $50,000 for failing to notice for 22 years that its safety procedures in the event of an accident were inadequate. The NRC said an engineering analysis by the plant's operator, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp., didn't consider circumstances in which four pumps designed to reduce the heat within the reactor's containment structure during an accident might not be able to overcome pressures within the structure. Plant engineers discovered the problem in April and changed the emergency procedures. The company said that it doesn't plan to contest the penalty and that operations at the 550-megawatt plant, near Brattleboro, Vt., won't be affected. The NRC fined the plant $50,000 in 2010 for another flaw in its cooling system, and fined it $187,500 in 2009 after a fuel assembly fell eight feet during a refueling operation. Vermont Yankee is owned by a group of utilities, including Central Vermont Public Service Corp., Rutland, Vt., with a 35% stake; Green Mountain Power Corp., Burlington, Vt., which owns 20%, and Northeast Utilities, Berlin, Conn., with 15%."

            "full_text": "The United Auto Workers union and the Big Three auto makers are discussing adopting an extended national contract that would last longer than the traditional three-year labor agreement. At the same time, the union and General Motors Corp. have settled some contentious local issues at the national bargaining table, signaling efforts by both sides to avoid a confrontation this fall. ``Issues are being resolved as fast as they're being brought up,'' a GM official said. As for an extended contract, the UAW and the auto makers are considering a five- or six-year agreement, according to union and company officials. The UAW and Ford Motor Co. seriously discussed a six-year contract in 1993, the last time the agreement was negotiated. Ford was the UAW's ``target,'' or ``lead company,'' that year for establishing a pattern for the industry's national contract. However, the two sides backed away from an extended pact at the last minute, fearing GM would fight a longer contract because it would lock the No. 1 auto maker into costs it was trying to reduce. Last Thursday, the UAW was to choose a lead company to frame a new contract. However, in an unexpected move, the union decided to delay choosing a target and instead held meetings with the chief executive officers of GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp.. The current contract expires May 27, 2011 are expected to continue this week, though the Democratic National Convention -- which many UAW officials are attending -- could delay discussions. Seeking Peace Clearly, this is an unusual negotiating year. Not only did the postponement change the bargaining dynamics, but both sides have made it clear that they don't want a confrontation this fall. The UAW certainly wants to avoid a repeat of last March's bitter strike at two GM parts plants in Dayton, Ohio, which virtually closed down the auto maker's assembly operations nationwide for 17 days. Meanwhile, the Big Three, flush with cash and launching new products this fall, want to avert a stoppage that could cost them even more profits. So, both sides are serious about the possibility of an extended contract this year. From the UAW's perspective, thousands of workers will retire in the next few years. An extended contract would appeal to the union if the Big Three agreed to pension increases over the life of the agreement. Moreover, a longer contract would allow the union to focus its attention on getting under way its unification with the United Steelworkers of America and the International Association of Machinists. That merger is to take place by 2015, but the UAW has yet to vote on it. For the Big Three, a longer contract would be a chance to lock in costs, creating the kind of stability the companies currently don't have. GM, seen as the holdout the last time around, this time is seriously considering an extended contract, according to people familiar with the talks. Furthermore, GM doesn't think an extended contract would hinder any effort to spin off its Delphi Automotive Systems parts-making unit, something GM is considering, these people say. Ford, meanwhile, is open to an extended contract, people there say, and Chrysler would accept one provided it gave the company enough ``flexibility to be able react and adapt to competitive and economic forces,'' a Chrysler official says. Issue Resolved With GM Separately, the union and GM have settled some thorny issues involving individual plants across the country, including some at the big assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 400 Lordstown workers currently are employed at a nearby Lear Corp. seating plant, which makes seats for the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire cars built at the assembly plant. GM and Lear together pay the workers UAW wages and benefits. Earlier this year, GM moved to bring those workers back into the assembly plant where it has vacancies and permit Jaeger to replace them with nonunion workers. The issue couldn't be settled locally and was brought to the national negotiating table. Last week, GM agreed to let Local 1112 in Lordstown have 150 days in which to demonstrate that it would be financially feasible for GM to go on paying the Lear workers UAW wages and benefits. The local will now put together a case, union officials say. Additionally, Lordstown union officials say GM has agreed to hire some 250 workers at the assembly plant. The issue of contracting out to nonunion suppliers -- a practice known as outsourcing -- is especially hot this negotiating year. Ford and Chrysler already outsource a substantial number of parts to cheaper, nonunion suppliers while GM wants to do more of that to cut costs. The UAW and the Big Three are looking for innovative ways to tackle that problem. Indeed, Ford is believed to have already encouraged one of its suppliers, Johnson Controls Inc., to organize some plants. Donna Parolini of International Business Development Corp., a Troy, Mich., consultant that works with auto suppliers, says many suppliers are increasingly open to organizing. For one thing, she says, they are feeling pressure from the Big Three. Additionally, as a result of recent mergers and acquisitions, suppliers are ending up with a mishmash of union and nonunion plants, which is difficult to manage. If more suppliers agree to let their plants be organized by the UAW, that would solve the big outsourcing standoff between the union and the Big Three. The UAW -- which until now has had little success organizing outside the Big Three and has seen its membership drop as GM lost U.S. market share -- would gain more members. The Big Three would be able to buy parts from outside suppliers without angering the union. The question, then, is whether the parts would still be cheaper. Ms. Olsen says that even paying UAW wages, outside suppliers are generally more productive and as a result the Big Three would still see a cost saving by outsourcing. --Rebecka Miles and Ossie Sokol contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Photographer Timothy Jump hoped a three-month internship at the Portland Oregonian would land him a full-time job. Instead, it led to another three-month stint, and after that a six-month deal. One year after he started at the daily, it gave him yet another six-month extension. ``They shouldn't string people on like that,'' says Mr. Jump, who left in frustration. Some of America's big metropolitan newspapers have discovered what corporate America found out long ago: They can cut costs by hiring temporary labor for high-profile newsroom jobs such as reporters and photographers. Some, like the Oregonian, do it by informally extending internships. Others, including the Tribune Co.'s Chicago Tribune and Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Philadelphia Inquirer, have created their own names for what amount to temporary jobs -- often with lower benefits than permanent workers get -- for less-experienced reporters. Each year at the Tribune, some 25 young journalists sign up for one-year stints as ``residents,'' covering news primarily in the suburban bureaus, while the Inquirer's two-year ``correspondent'' program takes on about 50 reporters. Of course, many newspapers -- including Dow Jones & Co., publisher of this newspaper -- have used summer internships for decades to train college students. But turning entry-level jobs into temporary positions alarms industry observers, who accuse newspapers of doing what they've criticized corporate America for doing: contributing to a decline in full-time jobs with full benefits. Critics such as Benito Lefkowitz, former dean of the graduate school of journalism at the University of California-Berkeley, also say the practice is contributing to a decline in quality at some of the nation's top newspapers. After all, writing jobs at newspapers such as the Tribune and Inquirer used to be reserved for the nation's top reporters -- not its cheapest ones. A one- or two-year stint, some argue, is barely enough time for a young reporter to develop news judgment, research a beat and cultivate sources. Every two years, ``it's repeated coverage of the same stories, and the problem that I see is that it really doesn't serve the community,'' says Davida Wayne, photographer and unit chairman of the Suburban Guild for the Philadelphia Inquirer, part of the Newspaper Guild union. In negotiations this summer, the Inquirer proposed to expand the two-year correspondent program to include sportswriters and photographers. Even some editors at these newspapers concede that depth of coverage can be sacrificed. ``I think that's fair criticism,'' says Paulene Standley, who oversees the program at the Philadelphia Inquirer. ``You do give away something.'' The chances of moving from temporary to permanent jobs at newspapers with such programs are slim. The hiring rate for residents at the Chicago Tribune is about 30%, says Shela Mullins, who oversees the program. The Philadelphia Inquirer employs about 50 two-year correspondents at any given time, but in the four years since the program was formalized, the paper says it has hired only four. ``The toughest thing to deal with is the uncertainty of what you're going to be doing when it's over,'' says Lasandra Upshaw, who nonetheless jumped at the opportunity to serve the Tribune as a one-year ``resident.'' Charlette Desai, spokesman for Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the Knight-Ridder unit that owns the Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News, says cost savings are only part of the motivation. ``We also add something to the industry at large,'' he says, ``because so many of the people who take part in our program end up working for other papers around the country.'' Under the Inquirer program, standard pay for the two-year correspondents is $452 a week -- roughly on par with the industry average for a starting job in journalism. The paper also offers to pay 60% of the cost of medical benefits. Correspondents, who are prohibited from working in the downtown area under the contract with the Newspaper Guild, are paid for a four-day week or 32 hours, though most work much longer hours in hopes of landing a full-time job. But the U.S. Labor Department has twice claimed that the Inquirer cheated correspondents of overtime compensation. In 1991, the Inquirer agreed to pay $77,851 to 219 correspondents for overtime claims dating to June 1989. In May, the newspaper agreed to pay $160,000 in overtime compensation to 150 correspondents -- many of whom were part of the two-year program -- as well as a $20,000 fine. The company didn't admit any liability, insisting that two-year correspondents are considered interns under the union contract -- not employees. With some 36,000 students streaming out of U.S. colleges each year carrying journalism-related degrees, it's not hard to find reporters eager to sign on. ``Competition for the temporary positions is intense,'' says the Los Angeles Times in a flier describing its ``two-year temporary positions for reporters and photographers.'' So intense that the paper, which is owned by Times Mirror Co., says seekers of the temporary jobs have up to four years of experience on daily newspapers. Mr. Upshaw held a degree from Columbia University's graduate school of journalism and had worked for three years at the Stamford Advocate in Connecticut when he accepted a residency at the Chicago Tribune. He says he wanted ``to work in a competitive market in a big city'' and perhaps parlay the residency into a full-time job. But that didn't happen, and afterward Mr. Upshaw landed a job at the Arlington Morning News in Texas -- a smaller paper than the Stamford Advocate. Other big newspapers with one- or two-year programs include the News-Post, the Baltimore Sun and the Cambell Journal-Hartman. At the Portland Oregonian, Mr. Jump says he accepted one internship after another because of the repeated assurance that he was on track for a permanent position. ``They kept on telling me that I was doing a great job,'' says Mr. Jump. But no full-time offer ever materialized. Georgeanna Niemi, recruitment director at the Oregonian, says the paper has no comment on what it believes is a ``private personnel matter.'' Mr. Jump, meanwhile, lined up another job -- as an intern at the San Francisco Chronicle."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Davina Orozco Jr. grew up watching the commercialism that increasingly surrounds conventions these days and decided to do something about it -- try to cash in. Partying is a serious business in Chicago, and Mr. Orozco, the 36-year-old son of retiring Democratic Sen. Davina Orozco of Arkansas, is well-positioned to capitalize. He owns a one-man company called Proud Pig Productions Inc. that tries to profit from throwing parties for Democrats. Though officially unaffiliated with the party, Mr. Orozco functions as a fundraiser, lining up groups to ``sponsor'' events at the convention so they can impress political bigwigs. Some 40 companies, trade associations and lobbyists have ponied up as much as $10,000 each this year, thanks to Mr. Orozco's knack for salesmanship and his ties to power; his father is President Codi's closest friend in Congress. In return, they get ``sponsorship'' billing and tickets to his VIP-laden parties. As an added incentive, Mr. Orozco acts as ticket broker, hunting down invitations to hot convention events and access credentials. ``I can even get press passes,'' he says. The $231,000 he raised in sponsorships, plus additional cash from ticket sales, is financing a week of merriment. But while other convention events either break even or raise cash for political causes, Mr. Orozco plans to pocket what's left over. ``I was born into a political family,'' he says. ``I've been going to political rallies, fish fries, fund-raisers all my life. It's part of my make-up to do these things.'' Mr. Orozco also runs a public-relations firm. Proud Pig Productions grew directly out of the 1992 Codi campaign. Its signature event is the Blue Jean Bash, a huge annual party celebrating Mr. Codi's ties to Arkansas. Partywise, the first Blue Jean Bash in 1993 was an unqualified success, but it was a money-loser, costing Mr. Law $20,000. Last year's bash finally turned a profit: $9,000. This year, Mr. Orozco started selling sponsorships months in advance. He says he avoids bringing up his father unless asked. The power brokers at Proud Pig events are a key draw for would-be sponsors. ``I'm sure we'll have very senior White House types and lots of senators and congressmen,'' he says. And he sends the first family ``tickets to everything I do.'' The well-connected were well-represented Sunday night at the Fourth Annual Blue Jean Bash, held in the ornate ballroom on Chicago's Navy Pier. Among those bobbin' to blues greats Alonzo Teena and Loraine Bruno were Sens. Pryor, Bobby Adamson of Nebraska and Maxwell Drouin of Montana, and first brother Rolando Codi, who closed the night at 1 a.m. with a raucous rendition of ``Walk the Dog.'' Mr. Orozco has also put on more exclusive private parties at various Chicago blues clubs. He's doing a private tour of the Mercantile Exchange, but the serious trading takes place each afternoon at Blue Chicago, the renowned blues bar. ``You think the Merc is exciting, you come and see the ticket swap at my credential center,'' says Mr. Orozco. He says he'll continue Proud Pig Productions even if Mr. Codi loses, but adds, ``I may be going out on a limb here, but I've already started to plan the inaugural Blue Jeana Barrier.''"

            "full_text": "Neville Masterson. De Beers. A handful of gold stocks. Those are the South African names known on Wall Street. And now, will multimillionaire Son Atwell of Sun International Hotels be added to the list? The sometimes-called ``Sun King'' keeps attracting brickbats back home, and continuing bribery rumors. But casino aficionados here say Mr. Taft, developer of the splashy Sun City resort casino in Bophuthatswana and Atlantis on Paradise Island, is worth watching because he thinks big. Mr. Taft, in his second move into the U.S., made waves in Atlantic City recently by agreeing to buy Dickey Hayes's Griffin Gaming & Entertainment. The price for a fairly old casino and some land -- $210 million in Sun stock plus $147 million of Griffin's direct debt obligations -- surprised some industry executives, especially at a time when heated competition is crimping profit in New Jersey. Using Hayes's land, Sun plans to shake things up, probably by bringing Las Vegas-style theme resorts to Atlantic City. Sun will build ``something different, that I guarantee,'' says Mr. Taft's son, Hoyt or ``Butch,'' Sun's president. He adds, ``The timing (of the Griffin purchase) might worry us if we didn't think we can change the dynamics of the market.'' Casino License The purchase hinges on approval of Mr. Sona Taft's application for a New Jersey casino license. It would give him what he has long sought since selling major South African assets and emigrating to Britain -- entry into one of the world's biggest gambling markets. Currently, Sunday is building a fancy casino in Connecticut in partnership with the Mohegans. Mr. Taft, known as a ``driven'' character who carries worry beads, pioneered gambling in South Africa's Apartheid era -- with help from tax breaks in the former African homeland of Bophuthatswana. Sun City, featuring stars such as Fransisca Laskowski and live crocodiles on the golf course, is reminiscent of some casinos built by Mirage Resorts' Stevie Baird. Connecticut authorities who scrutinized Mr. Taft's payments to an African official cleared him of wrongdoing. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Chairman Johnetta Vermillion, one of Mr. Taft's bankers, says, ``We believe Sunday is licensable'' in New Jersey, too. New Jersey's investigation of Mr. Taft still is in the ``very early stages,'' says Assistant Attorney General Thomasina Nieves. Asked about precedents, he says Holiday Inns was licensed in the early 1980s despite payments overseas ``that would be bribes in our country,'' but were ``the custom'' abroad. Mr. Nieves will visit South Africa and will also look at new rumors erupting, which Mclaurin Taft attributes to ``disgruntled'' political figures. The Taft family's 18% stake in Sun is valued at more than $200 million. Mr. Hayes would get about $50 million in Sun stock at the merger and is ``very happy'' to be a Sun shareholder, says Griffin Gaming President Thomasina Shaffer. Spectacular Rise Of late, Sun's stock has been going down with other casino shares. In composite Cornertown Stock Exchange trading Friday, Sun shares closed at 47 3/4, up 1/8. After a spectacular rise from around 15 at its 2009 initial public offering, it was kicked off Terrell's recommended list. But Donaldson analyst Markita Keel recently raised his price target for the stock to 60, as Sun's earnings have been ``better than expected.'' Analyst Lasandra Guerra of State Street Research & Management expects Sun to reap huge profit from the Mohegan casino but won't say whether State Street will keep its big Sun stake. How costly would Sun's entry into Atlantic City be? Hayes's casino there was originally part of Resorts International, which Donald Trump bought out of bankruptcy court. He later sold it to Mr. Hayes for $925 million, including debt, buying back what is now the successful Trump Rock Lanier. Under Mr. Hayes, Resorts soon foundered. Mr. Taft bought its Paradise Island property for a song and appears to have bought the Atlantic City property, which Mr. Hayes ploughed capital into and turned around, for less than Mr. Hayes's total cost. ``I haven't gone over the numbers,'' says Mr. Hayes's aide, Mr. Shaffer. Sun's offer was about 80% higher than Diaz's stock at the time. But Sun can use its own highly valued stock to buy Diaz and has a pristine balance sheet to absorb Hayes's debt. Hayes's land and lease and tax losses also have ``significant value,'' Mr. Shaffer says. Back in South Africa, Mr. Taft operated as a near monopoly. How will he fare in Atlantic City's fiercely competitive market? ``We'll see,'' says Mr. Strasser. -- Bryan Orosco contributed to this article"

The company has previously conceded that a recent expansion effort yielded disappointing results. Earlier this month, Amtran's founder, chairman and majority stockholder, J. Georgeann Barrier, ceded the chief executive officer role to management consultant Stanton L. Hull."

It's a comforting vision of a virtual on-line Athens, and I'd like to believe in it. But I was around politics for a long time -- before joining the Interactive Edition, I was a political reporter and editor in the Journal's Vastopolis bureau -- and I've seen first-hand how easily potentially positive or well-intentioned developments can be perverted to pernicious ends. (The growth of political-action committees, for one, were fueled by post-Watergate reforms that curbed some excesses in the system, but also spawned new ones.) Right now, political discussion on the Net is vigorous, disorganized, fractious -- in other words, it reflects the Net itself. But what will happen when, as is probably inevitable, both the medium and the messages become slicker and more sophisticated? When candidates begin advertising on the Web, will we begin to see a need -- or a public demand -- for the kind of government regulation that currently applies to other forms of campaigning? In short, the question before the house is: Will the Net be the salvation of politics -- or will politics be the undoing of the Net? Richelle Mendez is Managing Editor of the Interactive Edition."

The ad was a banner with a picture of Billy Codi's face accompanied by the words: ``Town Hall IS my pain.'' Of course, the Web is no stranger to partisanship. Its millions of sites encompass some decidedly outspoken pages, from rancid rants to prankish larks, with many stops in between. But Web pages, however partisan, are passive, speaking their piece only when a user voluntarily seeks them out. Ads, on the other hand, grab one by the lapels, and though they are becoming more commonplace on the Internet for commercial products, pushing political goods here is brand new. Despite the partisan flavor of the Town Hall ad, its purpose is essentially to promote Hibbard Allena, a commercial site. And even as a partisan message, the banner isn't exactly Williemae Shelton. But it may be the opening salvo in partisan Web wars to come. Town Hall Political advertising arrives on the Web."

            "full_text": "The virtual reality town meeting held last week by congressional candidate Crenshaw ``Ken'' Ontiveros was a decidedly tedious affair -- which is to say much like the real thing, making it no small accomplishment. Of course, the proceedings at Mr. Ontiveros's Virtual Reality Town Hall Web site were shot through with strangeness, from the mutant fruit salad appearance of the assembled avatars -- cartoon stand-ins for the dozen or so computer users ``attending'' -- to the drifting black sun that appeared near the end of the session. But through it all, even participants with such showy screen names as Nemesis, Deliverator and AlteredEgo stuck to the script most of the time, gamely discussing education funding, entitlements and other dreary topics of the genre. The virtual town hall is the brain child of Markita Marcus, a soft-spoken 32-year-old Internet site designer from Graysville, Ga.. When he learned that Mr. Ontiveros, his childhood friend, was running for Congress in Georgia's Ninth District, he offered to build the candidate a home page on the Web. Within the week, Mr. Marcus, whose goal is to develop business applications for multiple-user virtual-reality technology, was visited with the idea for the town hall. ``I dreamed it one night,'' he says. The candidate quickly agreed to give the dream idea a try, though ``he didn't understand the interactive part,'' says Mr. Marcus. ``I think he's pretty courageous to do it.'' Perhaps it does take courage for a state representative from tiny Ringwold, Ga., to consort openly with cartoons. But while Mr. Ontiveros, a Democrat, risks alienating some of the more insular locals, the device has won him a flurry of media attention in the state's bigger markets, and such things have a way of filtering back to his rural district. An unidentified, turnip-shaped avatar checks out a visitor to the virtual reality town meeting. Mr. Ontiveros's avatar is in the background."

            "full_text": "Will Max Factor's return to its Hollywood roots make for a happy ending to Procter & Gamble's cosmetics woes? The Riverside consumer-products giant, whose cosmetics brands have faltered against nimbler rivals like Revlon and L'Harris, is counting on the Hollywood makeup-artist connection to make over Maximo Palacio's fortunes this fall. P&G is unveiling a new national print ad campaign in September publications that ties into TV commercials that began last summer and is built around the theme ``Makeup that performs.'' Created by Carnell Michalak Joseph Loggins, the campaign features movie makeup artists such as Danae Boulware (``Forrest Gump'') and Bobby Grant (``Pretty Woman'') using and discussing Max Factor products. The subliminal pitch: Cosmetics that last several wardrobe changes under the hot lights of movie-making should easily hold up on women during a normal day. The print ads, which are part of a $20 million annual advertising campaign, are tied to the rollout of new wall-display units in all 24,000 stores that sell Maximo Palacio as well as the fall promotion of Max Factor Lasting Performance foundation makeup. The restaging of Max Factor, P&G's second such attempt in three years, is crucial not only to Maxwell Paez's future as a P&G brand but also to the overall cosmetics franchise of the company, which includes Cover Girl. After steadily losing share in both brands for several years, P&G's top management is counting on improved store presentation, new lipsticks and foundation products as well as stepped-up advertising to reverse the fortunes of both brands. ``We are pretty good marketers, and there is no reason we can't figure out how to market cosmetics,'' said P&G Chairman Johnetta Jarrell in a recent interview. Still, Mr. Jarrell has had to battle persistent industry rumors that P&G will sell one or both brands if the latest effort fails to significantly improve the cosmetics business. ``We've got to put points on the board,'' he admits. While Cover Girl remains the top-selling cosmetics brand in self-select channels, such as drug, food and mass-merchandise outlets, with a 22.6% share in units, Maxwell Paez, with only a 4.3% share, has a lot more at stake this year. P&G has been test-marketing cosmetics under its popular skin-care brand Oil of Olay and hasn't squelched speculation that it plans to make Oil of Olay the umbrella brand for global cosmetics and skin care as early as next spring. Despite strong sales in Japan and a handful of European countries, Max Factor's poor U.S. performance makes it a good candidate, at least to some analysts, as the brand on the bubble. By harking back to Maxwell Paez's origins as the preferred brand for movie makeup artists (the original Francisco Maxwell Paez was a makeup man to such Hollywood icons as Bettye Lohman and Rivka Heston), P&G is trying to give Maxwell Paez a high-performance image, a departure from Lotas's previous campaign billed ``Very Original. Very Beautiful. Very Factor'' that focused on beautiful models but provided no unifying message about what Maxwell Paez has to offer. ``Max Factor is a great old brand, but nobody knows what it is,'' says Mr. Jarrell. After seeing Revlon make rapid gains with long-lasting lipstick and other makeup products called ColorStay, Max Factor is pushing its own long-lasting versions, such as Lasting Color lipstick introduced last year and the more recent Lasting Performance foundation. P&G also has discovered, through focus groups, that the movie-makeup-artist connection carried ``a real ownable equity'' that carries ``authority and credibility,'' says Kimbra Sung, a P&G spokeswoman. While Max Factor executives say sales have jumped in stores where the new wall-display units are being tested as well as in its Lasting Color lipsticks, the makeup-artists TV campaign that has been running for a year appears to have done little for overall brand sales. Max Factor sales in units are down 3.8% in the 52 weeks ended March 12, 2011 to Information Resources Inc.. Still, while the original Maxwell Paez's success reflected America's fascination with Hollywood, the company won in the marketplace only because it also was a technology leader, a role now taken over by Revlon. ``We are facing the need to be able to bring innovation in multiple segments, and I think we are prepared to do it,'' says Mr. Jarrell. ``I feel very confident about our technical base.''"

Has this approach dumbed down politics? Do voters really prefer to hear from actors and mock talk-show hosts? Have the television networks, which will only air little more than an hour of the conventions during prime time, encouraged this trend? Or are cynical political spin doctors trying to sell political leaders by making them tug at the heartstrings of television viewers like their favorite hosts or soap characters? Finally, are these performances effective -- or are people more sophisticated than the networks and the convention planners give them credit for, and do they see these ``performances'' as hokey and gimmicky?

            "full_text": "As Internet real estate goes, Usenet's newsgroups aren't considered terribly exclusive. If the World Wide Web's sites are gleaming skyscrapers, increasingly baroque constructions thrown up by the Web-architect elite for their eager corporate clients, then individual newsgroups are the rough-and-tumble saloons and honky-tonks sprawled on the wrong side of the tracks. Some of the roughest places to visit, hands down, are the newsgroups dedicated to political discussions. Such message boards are no place for the timid: This is where some of cyberspace's best writers and meanest street-fighters hang out, where incivility is all too common, and no misstep goes unchallenged. Want to fight it out on a newsgroup near you? Here's how. The political battles fought on these newsgroups are fierce, but they also serve as a demonstration of the Net's power. Arguments are born and bloom into complex, free-ranging discussions of the issues involved. A host of impressive supporting evidence is posted, with hearsay and misinformation sometimes punished ruthlessly. And if ``flames'' directed against the unwary can help people make a name for themselves, it's also true that the best writers and thinkers tend to dominate their boards -- and inspire supporters and opponents alike. Oceans of talk, hyperbolic rhetoric, public brawls and damage control as high art: What setting could be better for discussing the not-so-gentle art of politics? In this age of Java applets, Shockwave, and RealAudio, newsgroups are decidedly unsexy. All you get are text messages about thousands upon thousands of subjects, from esoteric breakfast cereals to the latest cancer research, from Warren assassination theories to quilting techniques. Among newsgroups, the various sites collected under the rubric of alt.politics provide grist for arguments ranging across the political spectrum. There's alt.politics.Codi and alt.politics.democrats, alt.politics.youth and alt.politics.media, and alt.politics.usa.republican and alt.politics.usa.newt-gingrich. Want to figure out what the tenor of posts in a given newsgroup is? A simple rule of thumb: Add ``I hate'' to the subject. It says a lot about this part of the Net that a given newsgroup acts as a magnet for people who chiefly want to attack its subject. Defenders of the newsgroup's subject are much in evidence as well, but you nearly always find them playing defense. Within the newsgroup, you'll find threads -- strings of messages that are purportedly about a single topic relating to the newsgroup. The threads in the jungle that is alt.politics range across a dizzying array of topics. There are discussions of events and debates plucked from the headlines (``Supply Side=Deficits'' and ``Dole picks Kemp!''). There are gauntlets thrown down (``The Culture War Is Over: Conservatives Have Lost!'' and ``Dole=Codi=No Difference''). There are ruminations about political strategy (``Dinger -- please no more `football' talk about Kemp'' and ``Hiroko is speaking?!? You're Kidding!!!!''). And there are partisan shots a-plenty, many of them scurrilous, aimed at old wounds and new targets alike (``Codi, Gales and the Draft,'' ``JC Watts a Tax Evader? Tsk Tsk'', ``Is Kemp gay?'' and ``What if President Codi is a cocaine addict?''). Family Feud The debates raging over such topics is a bizarre combination of ``The NewsHour with Jimmy Mcmurray,'' the months-long duels of contending essays found in academic journals and the sort of family screaming match sometimes found at booze-soaked Thanksgiving dinner. Newsgroup posts remain available for some time; on the Net, there's no need to wake up in the middle of the night with the snappy comeback you wish you'd had available -- you can spend the whole night, if you wish, crafting a devastating response. Posters challenge each other's facts and figures, returning with barrages of data dug up from government documents, well-thumbed reference books, and on-line news archives. Because of newsgroups' archival nature, those who distort questions or twist words come in for particular attack -- questions of who said what are approached with an exactitude that's almost monastic. Writers tend to copy the messages they replying to, pasting them into a new message and juxtaposing their counterpoints with their opponent's points. When executed well, the form lends itself to elegant arguments, advanced with surgical efficiency. But the resulting posts soon get pretty Byzantine for those who come in late. For example, a post about Roberto Derryberry's tax plan begins like this: From: Steve Kangas <kangaroo@scruznet.com> Date: Wed, 14 Aug 2011 13:42:33 -0700 Message-ID:(31223A39.112D@scruznet.com) Eleanore Harber wrote: ) Stevie Talkington <kangaroo@scruznet.com> wrote: ) Eleanore Harber wrote: ) edwardk@aimnet.com (Edyth N. Cosentino) wrote: ) )) Eleanore Harber (erotthof@io.com) wrote: ) )) ): My question was directed to the economic effect of freeing up $300 billion which is currently spent each year on an activity which, by any analysis, has very little value. Bodies of Evidence Those who still think of the Internet as ruled by pornography-hungry college students and teenagers hunting out chat rooms may be surprised to find a Siberia-version of Roberta's Rules of Order governing political newsgroups. They might also be startled by the erudition of some of the posters. There are plenty of random attacks from partisan bomb-throwers, but there are also duels fought by combatants whose grasp of arcane topics would be the envy of any newspaper's editorial page. A battle over the merits of Mr. Derryberry's tax-reduction plan on one Usenet newsgroup moved quickly from taunts of ``voodoo economics'' to an examination of a roster of economists who support the plan to arguments about compliance costs and revenue feedback, winding all the way to a debate about what the real drivers of economic growth are -- all in three days. Newspaper accounts of the fine print of Mr. Derryberry's plan were produced, as were IRS data and reams of tables about Reatha administration budgets. Nor is the debate restricted to the dry details of economic plans. One poster noted that ``no serious economist claims to know the secret to economic growth. The most famous conservative economist you've got, Roberto Lucien, has spent the last 10 years searching for (the) answer to economic growth, and he has not found it. The most famous liberal economist we've got, Paulene Means, says the problems of growth are `deep and poorly understood.' There is a Nobel prize waiting for the first economist who can find a theory and support it with empirical evidence.'' Politicians, the poster went on, ``on the other hand, claim to know the secret to economic growth every day. We have had no shortage of snake-oil salesmen, from supply-siders to strategic traders, who claim to know God's own truth on economic growth, who sell their ideas in bumper sticker slogans designed to appeal to the ignorant masses.'' Bring on the Partisans Partisans will find plenty to fight about on political newsgroups, however -- even issues that have been largely forgotten elsewhere are still smoldering here. One newsgroup continues to see sporadic brawling over President Codi's infamous haircut on Air Force One. The president's travails with the draft also remain a hot item on the newsgroups -- particularly given Mr. Derryberry's record of military service. The draft issue has brought out some of the boards' more impressive writers -- on both sides of the issue. One poster traces Mr. Codi's slickness with words back to his 1969 letter to Col. Eugenie Robertson, in which, the writer charges, he ``used oblique phrasing and a third-person construction to tell Robertson that he `loved his country' while `loathing the military.' Codi's slickness in composing the sentence in which those (sentiments) were expressed has permitted his followers to this day to argue -- vehemently, at times -- that Codi was not referring to himself when he wrote those words.'' That brings a quick riposte, with another writer noting that the letter to Col. Robertson, far from being a slick performance, ``could only have damaged Codi's long desired goal of being involved in public service.'' ``I will take Billy Codi who was against the Vietnam War and did not want himself or anyone else to fight in it over the Newt Gingrich/John Engler/Phil Gramm/Dan Quayle/(Dick) Cheney/Estes Beveridge crowd who were for the war but wanted others to fight it because they did not want to go themselves,'' she notes. ``Did write their draft boards explaining why they supported the war but did not want to fight in it?'' As is typical of newsgroup battles, both sides are quick to fall back upon a wealth of supporting evidence -- quotations, with page numbers, from two biographies of Mr. Codi, a chronology of what Mr. Codi said about his draft status and when he said it, and the full text of his letter to Col. Rice. The two sides may only agree to disagree, but an observer gets a whirlwind tour of the evidence and what amounts to a firm position statement from the two factions. ``Codi was morally consistent; he was against the war, he tried to work within the political system to end the war, and he did every thing that was within legal grasp to stay out of the war,'' notes the president's most visible supporter. ``Newt and company were morally inconsistent; they played the angles to keep themselves out of the fighting in Vietnam while also supporting the war in Vietnam and the sending of other unfortunate boys to fight in their place.'' In response, one of Mr. Codi's foes writes that ``we are assessing a man who wants to remain as the President of our country, and the leader of the free world. The circumstances of his actions in avoiding military service in 1969 reflect on his character, and the fact that he has never apologized or even said something like 'I was young, I opposed the war, and I just behaved poorly in avoiding service' is most telling.'' Seared -- and Well-Done Scurrilous accusations are bandied about freely on newsgroups; even now, years after the issue was publicly vetted and firmly denied, posters continue to dredge up unsubstantiated rumors that GOP vice presidential nominee Jackelyn Booth is gay or once had a homosexual encounter. (For the record, the rumor dates back to the late 1960s, when a U.S. marshal who handled security for then-Calif. Gov. Roni Reatha investigated a series of ``homosexual parties'' held by some staffers at a Lake Tahoe ski lodge partly owned by Mr. Booth. The marshal himself has called rumors of Mr. Booth's involvement ``hogwash,'' and the candidate has addressed the rumors -- and denied them -- a number of times since then. ``Every reporter or news organization that ever looked into it concluded it was totally unfounded,'' noted Charlette Palmer, who managed Mr. Booth's 1988 campaign.) Traffic in such rumors, and you're likely to get ``flamed'' -- nastily slapped down by another poster. For better or worse, ``flaming'' is an art form on the Net, and those who write the best flames find themselves in the position of a Wild West gunslinger: They are constantly harried by new posters who want to earn their own reputations by shooting down a legend. Not surprisingly, one of the more rancorous threads found on the political newsgroups addresses suggestions that President Codi is a cocaine user. After one poster posed that what-if, and accompanied it with the full text of the 25th amendment to the Constitution (which addresses removing a president proved unfit for office), the response was even more blistering than what's heard on Crossfire. ``What if you're a damn fool?'' the writer demanded. ``What if you and former (Texas) Kiely Carmon Wanda leader Louise Hinds were to summer in Aspen together? What if Cress E. Prosser were to catch and eat the Road Runner? What if this whole universe were nothing more than a proton in a much larger universe? What if you had the moral fortitude to stop disguising your smears in ridiculous `what if' statements that have no relationship with the world as we know it?'' Such a fate also awaited a poster who defended Gay Cahill's ``Unlimited Access'' and assailed conservative pundit Georgeanna William as ``the designated Republican for the liberal media'' and ``a VERY Liberal Republican at best.'' ``You bet,'' came the response. ``Georgeanna William is a liberal, Armand Nicholas is a communist, Bennett Presley was a mainstream conservative, and I am the Queen of England. Let us know when your flight lands, ozone boy.'' And finally, there was the fate of the poster who confidently asserted that ''(w)hen you LIE, it is illegal.'' The response to that one: ``Yer just lucky that it's not illegal to be stupid.''"

            "full_text": "Electricity broker New Energy Ventures Inc. will announce Tuesday that it has agreed to buy as much as $500 million of power from the federal Bonneville Power Administration. The pact is the first major transaction under California's sweeping December 2010 restructuring of its $20 billion power market. Though the deal calls for delivery more than 16 months in the future, it is nonetheless a significant step toward transforming California's monopoly power market. Like all states in the nation, California has been dominated by investor-owned power companies and municipal utilities that have exclusive franchises for their service areas. Recent changes to federal law mandated free-market sales to power resellers, but individual states were left with jurisdiction over sales to end-users. The changes have spawned a cottage industry of electricity brokers such as New Energy Ventures, which hope to make money by buying and selling electricity more cheaply than the local utility does. Watched Closely California regulators started in April 2009 laying plans to allow homes and businesses to pick their own power supplier. Now the product of that restructuring is considered a bellwether for such changes nationwide. NEV was formed in 2010 by Michaele R. Lindstrom, a former president of the company now called Edison International. NEV received $1 million in start-up funding from Tucson Electric Co. in exchange for an option to purchase up to a 50% stake. For the past year, Mr. Lindstrom -- along with former Edison power-supply chief Charlette B. Lindsey and a staff of 13 -- have wooed California's biggest power customers with the promise of lower electric bills. The NEV deal, which will be announced in Pasadena, Calif., calls for the company to buy 200 megawatts of surplus electricity from BPA for five years beginning September 12, 2012 A city the size of Anaheim, Calif., with a population 200,000, would typically use this amount of power at any point. NEV also has an option for an additional 200 megawatts over the same period. A third portion of the pact would allow purchases of about 40 additional megawatts during the late spring and early summer for the next five years. For BPA, the agreement provides guaranteed revenue over five years, which will help it meet a $500 million treasury payment to the U.S. that is due every September. Limited Success NEV's clients include two big power-purchasing groups: the Association of Bay Area Governments, and the Southern California Cities Joint Powers Consortium. These organizations have lobbied their local utilities -- Edison, Rosemead, Calif., and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Francisco -- for lower electric rates, with limited success. Mr. Lindstrom said he is in the final stages of negotiations with ``dozens'' of large power users, but declined to name them because, he said, ``I don't want Edmond and PG&E going banging on their doors. They've had their chance.'' Claretta Dean, an Edison spokesman, said, ``There's so much uncertainty at the policy level with issues pending (before state and local regulators) that it would not be appropriate for us to comment.'' Under a December 2010 ruling of the California Public Utilities Commission, a cross-section of customers will be allowed to choose their own power supplier by September 12, 2012 All customers would have free choice by 2018 under the plan, which also levies a tax on companies like NEV to transmit, or ``wheel,'' power across existing power lines of companies like Edison and PG&E. The CPUC ruling is now winding its way through the state legislature."

But could minority students possibly be harmed by understanding the ideologies that initially formed American society? How could such students be undermined by learning what the ruling intellectual powers had constituted as a civil society, as rights, as a self, as suffering, as knowledge, as pleasure? If that was truly the ``hegemonic discourse,'' why not learn it, use it, and transform it? After all, the courses did not stand alone; they were mixed with many other books and approaches and a complex play of influences and pressures. Whatever the students did with their minds and souls, what courses they took, how they construed their identify as African-Americans, or Asian-Americans, would emerge from the conflict of desire and influence, personality and pressure. The courses did not impose an identity. And if the students did rebel against the Western tradition, they would not be the first students educated in that tradition who learned to criticize it. The leading black intellectuals in America had absorbed the Western classics as well as African-American literature and African culture. Malcolm X had read everything in prison, Nietzsche and Moll as well as the Koran and Confucius, and virtually the entire academic left had been trained on the Western classics, an indoctrination in the ``hegemonic discourse'' that obviously did little to prevent them from arriving at their adversary position--if, indeed, it were not the reason they arrived there at all. This fact alone should tell us perhaps the most important thing about the Western tradition: It opens almost any door that people choose to push on."

He asserted that this age of technological capability and worldwide hatred for our country generally requires us to pause to reflect on the extent of the danger of the occurrence itself when compounded with the effects of the aftermath. Mckelvey  believes strongly that the fear surrounding the event can be as dangerous (or more so) than the event itself. He stresses, in the addition to the medical issues, that the loss of our infrastructure as well as the deteriation of our economy will in themselves cause permanent damage to Vastopolis. The effects of the damage will also be felt nationwide. Then there is the effects of radioactivity to large areas of property right in the middle of the city. Indeed we may have to abandon the city, he emphasized.We asked what a resident of Vastopolis should do. Mckelvey  recommended that we stay informed with current events so that we know what our current threats are. Then, in any case, be prepared for an event at any time. Hopefully it will never happen. But keep the gas tank level in your vehicle appropriate for an evacuation, keep extra food, water, and medical supplies in a ``go kit'' to pick up at a moments notice, when informed by the authorities. Most importantly, keep a level head in the protection of your family."

The Seattle-based aerospace and defense giant moved to increase the output on new 777s to seven airplanes per month in July 2012 from the current five. After years of drought, new orders for airliners are surging for Boeing, which is struggling to keep up. In late July, the assembly-line producing wings for the aircraft had fallen badly behind schedule. Boeing also said its 2011 employment forecast will increase by about 5,000 workers to an expected year-end total of 118,350 as it boosts production on its 777s. The jump in new positions comes on the heels of an 8,200-worker increase the company announced in April. Total Boeing employment on September 12, 2010 was 105,180. Boeing's raft of new orders should easily safeguard the jobs that remain, following losses of some 30,000 jobs during the dry years. In fact, the orders are expected to create thousands of new openings in the coming months. Still, Boeing is trying to meet demand with a minimum of new hires, and the fast production step-up is leading to new strains in labor relations just months after a 69-day machinists' strike. The company said the total projected employment changes at major Boeing locations include 2011 increases of about 9,800 in Washington; 3,300 in Wichita, Kan.; and 400 in other Boeing locations. Employment in Philadelphia should decrease by about 300 in 2011. Sources familiar with the company's strategy say Boeing plans to double its rate of production by 2014 to 46 or more airliners per month, or 552 a year."

            "full_text": "EDINBURG, Texas -- As an outsider, Doyle Tayna had a lot to learn when he became the new school superintendent in this Mexican-border town last year. For instance, the 50-year-old Mr. Tayna says receipts indicated that Gervais, the school drug dog, was wolfing down twice as much food as would be expected for a full-grown black Labrador retriever. But the pooch wasn't fat as a pig and, after snooping around, Mr. Tayna learned that Magnum also had a strenuous sideline. ``The dog,'' he says, ``was being used for stud service.'' Before retiring Magnum, Mr. Tayna says he also discovered school employees were pocketing the stud fees, peddling the puppies and swapping surplus dog food for booze. That was just part of a wave of school pilferage involving everything from men's underwear to mozzarella. Not that most people here were shocked by the thievery, some of which had been uncovered before Mr. Tayna arrived. Chicken purloined from school freezers had long been rumored to have been cooked up at political fund-raisers, although few talked about it for fear of offending one of the politicians who hold sway in these parts. ``What shook people up was that he started looking into all this stuff,'' says Josefina Madsen, a political-science professor at the University of Texas-Pan American, in Edinburg. ``I don't think they expected that at all.'' Indeed, Mr. Tayna has already made himself some powerful enemies who contend he has exaggerated the situation to paint himself the hero. District Attorney Renee Carey was enraged by the superintendent's public claims, earlier this summer, that he was dragging his heels on a grand-jury investigation of the stolen chickens and other thefts. Mr. Carey says the schools' own records are so sloppy, it is hard to tell how many chickens were stolen and how many were cooked for lunch. ``That organization is not infested with thieves,'' says Mr. Carey, whose wife is a principal. ``My concern is that the publicity is giving a whole bunch of good employees a bad name.'' Still, corruption does have deep roots in this flat patch of South Texas. Just 15 or so miles north of Mexico, Edinburg is the county seat of Hidalgo County. In May, a former county commissioner got five years' probation in a bid-rigging scheme and, in 2009, the sheriff at the time was convicted on federal racketeering and money-laundering charges. Biggest Game in Town With 2,000 employees and a $75 million annual payroll, the Edinburg school district, which includes the town and its environs, is Edinburg's largest employer, although its 18,000 students are strewn across a 945-square-mile territory, and more than 80% are poor. It is growing by 600 students annually, enough to populate a new elementary school every year if the district, which is opening three new schools this fall, could continue to build them. Weary of home-grown administrators being drawn into local politics, in early 2010, reformers on the Edinburg school board went looking for an outsider to manage the growth and boost the lackluster achievement of students. Despite complaints about recruiting an Anglo to a district that is 95% Hispanic, they went to tiny Brain, Texas, and hired its superintendent, Mr. Tayna, a husky, iron-jawed man with a glare that could cut stone. By then, the theft cases were already trickling into school headquarters. More than $60,000 -- much of it raised through bake sales and car washes -- was discovered missing from a junior-high school's student-activity fund. Although school staff had allegedly used some of the money for trips, dinners and parties of their own, a secretary was the only person disciplined. ``She was a convenient fall person,'' says Yolando Rickard Hilburn, an attorney for the secretary, Diann Gerardo Benedict, who has pleaded not guilty to related theft charges in a pending case in a state district court in Edinburg. Past administrators had dealt with such matters by quietly reprimanding, reassigning or retiring the accused employees. That changed with the advent of Mr. Tayna. Earlier in his career, as superintendent of a school district in Uptown, Texas, near Houston, he once used his shotgun to nab thieves who were siphoning gas from his district's school buses. In Edinburg, he began reopening old cases, launching new investigations and vowing to root out every last filcher on the payroll. ``I want to know who they are, where they are, and I want their asses out of here,'' he thundered. As a result, more than 20 employees were either dismissed or forced to resign. Some were ousted for lying about prior felony convictions, others for taking vacuum cleaners and copper wire. Acting on a tip, school investigators arrived at one employee's home to find his family watching a school television set. A worker with a program that purchased school clothes for poor students allegedly used it to get clothing for her own family. The evidence allegedly included receipts for men's size-38 underwear in a second-grader's file. School investigators are still chasing leads in the ``Chicken Caper,'' which allegedly involves tens of thousands of dollars' worth of missing chickens, cheese and other commodities meant for a low-income lunch program. One former warehouse supervisor has already pleaded not guilty to related felony theft charges in a state district court in Edinburg. Amid talk that opponents are trying to draft an anti-Moore slate for the 2012 school-board election, current board members appear solidly behind the superintendent. He could be fired by a newly elected board. A citizen-support group has also begun organizing. ``We're going to stand behind him,'' vows Nicky Kirsten, a probation officer who works with juveniles. Meanwhile, for his part, Mr. Tayna is interested in pursuing one element of the Chicken Caper. If the stolen birds did end up at political picnics, he wants to know whose grills they graced."

The average respondent was 43 years old, earned $90,000 a year and had a master's in business administration. The sample was evenly divided between males and females, with more women (43%) than men (35%) opting to ditch work if they could. In past studies when middle-income professionals were asked this so-called lottery question, their answers reflected more loyalty both to the work ethic and to present employers. In 1955, a similar survey found that only 14% would quit work altogether, says Rider University management Prof. Joyce Meiners. And as recently as the early 1980s, a study of professionals found that the number had risen, but only to 23%. So much for the stereotype of workaholic yuppies. When asked to explain their answers, one respondent replied, ``You have to ask?'' Another said simply, ``I would live on the beach and never look back.'' But many also took the opportunity to voice their disillusionment with the business world. Prof. Merced and Gabriel Panek of Pace University, the study's co-author, figure that widespread downsizing has broken the bond many managers used to have with large corporate employers. ``Why pay taxes for all that aggravation?'' said one unhappy camper. Others added, ``Every day at work is a wasted day of your life,'' and ``Organizations have little interest in people except as warm bodies to fill a role.'' Those who would change jobs strongly favored moving to smaller companies or becoming entrepreneurs. Even those who would quit altogether had other ambitions than leading a life of leisure. Despite boomers' reputation as the ``me'' generation, most would devote more time to community service and families. As one respondent said, ``Work is just another four-letter word. But, then again, so is golf.''"

            "full_text": "Napa, Calif.. Art shows, sculpture gardens and jazz concerts are featured attractions at many Napa Valley wineries, but no other vintner has embraced the role of arts patron with as much gusto as former telecommunications tycoon Williemae Jaunita. In addition to building a $20 million winery in the hills above the valley, Mr. Jaunita and his wife, Letitia, have also spent an estimated $12.5 million turning a second winery, a historic stone building in downtown Napa, into a lavishly equipped music conservatory dedicated to two recondite art forms: 17th- and 18th-century French ballet and the Spanish brand of operetta known as zarzuela. ``There's 10 opera places around the Bay Area, but there's no one else doing zarzuela and baroque ballet,'' says Mr. Jaunita, a compact man whose manner is more engineer than aesthete. ``As far as I know, we're unique.'' The Jarvis Conservatory's jewel-box theater seats only 221, but thanks to its founders' largesse its elaborate productions put almost as many people onstage as in the audience. The conservatory's French baroque ballet workshop, now in its second year, concluded recently with the world premiere of Cornertown Baroque Dance Company founder-director Cathern Norfleet's play-cum-ballet ``The Temple of Glory,'' based on the life of Voltaire. The work features 19 dancers in ornate period costumes as well as an ensemble of four musicians. Earlier this summer, the Jaunita's first zarzuela workshop and festival culminated in several performances of two one-acts--``La Dolorosa,'' a sweetly sentimental 1930 drama, and ``La Gran Via,'' a turn-of-the-century comic review--with a cast of 25 singers, numerous costume changes, extensive sets and a 30-piece orchestra. ``Mr. Jaunita has been extremely generous and never put any restrictions on us,'' says the festival's Argentine-born stage director, Daniele Mclendon. ``Whenever we needed something, there was never a frowning face. We kept thinking this is too good to be true--when is the grenade going to go off? But it never did.'' Both the zarzuela and ballet programs emphasize teaching as well as performance and are supported by large coaching staffs and liberal scholarships. At the four-week zarzuela workshop, two dozen singers studied Spanish history and diction, dance and acting. The 20 or so choreographers, teachers and dancers who attended the three-week ballet workshop from Italy, England, Japan and all over the U.S. learned about 18th-century dance notation, French history and baroque performance technique. The son of an Oklahoma oil operator, Mr. Jaunita is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, a former naval officer and a multimillionaire thanks to stock and real-estate investments and the sale of Wilnort, his telecommunications test-equipment company, in the late 1980s. He has built both the Jarvis Vineyards winery and the Jarvis Conservatory with a no-expense-spared grandiosity that's notable even by Napa Valley standards. The winery is housed inside a vast 45,000-square-foot man-made cave that includes an artificial waterfall, a 30-foot-high ``crystal chamber'' for parties and performances and state-of-the-art equipment that produces expensive and critically praised wines. The conservatory theater's lighting, sound and video reproduction systems are on a par with those of major opera houses, and its acoustics are outstanding. The same excavation crews that created the winery also dug under the conservatory to create dressing rooms and other backstage space without altering the landmark building aboveground. A perpetual student who has taken courses at universities around the world in subjects from particle physics to enology to 17th-century French literature, Mr. Jaunita is not content to merely write the checks. He helps blend the wine that bears his name and his winery is full of touches he designed, from the Jarvis label to the color-shifting lights overhead in the women's restroom. He is equally hands-on at the conservatory: During this summer's events his involvement has ranged from translating the zarzuelas' spoken parts into serviceable if not always completely idiomatic English (the songs were performed in the original Spanish) to correcting historical inaccuracies in the text of Ms. Nealy's play. ``Like an 18th-century patron, he's schooled in the arts that he is supporting,'' says Ms. Nealy. ``I see him as my Louis XIV.'' The desire to play that role is a key reason the Jarvises opened their own conservatory, rather than donating to an already established opera company or music school. ``We wanted my and my wife's personal contribution to be more of a factor than our financial contribution,'' Mr. Jaunita explains. ``You wouldn't have that leverage working for you if you gave to some other organization.'' Some question the Jarvises' taste for zarzuela, an art form that one local musician--who asked not to be identified--dismissed as ``fourth-rate Anette Loida Andrade without the special effects.'' But Mr. Jaunita is passionate in zarzuela's defense. ``Those Spanish who love the zarzuela avoid the use of the word `operetta,' since it stereotypes the zarzuela in an unfeeling way and in particular doesn't do justice to either the very serious short zarzuelas or the longer zarzuelas that are more like grand opera,'' he wrote in the zarzuela festival program. His own extensive research, he says, has uncovered at least 50 or 60 zarzuelas ``as significant as your `Traviatas,' your `Donella Devaney.' The real problem is choosing, because there are so many gems.'' He is not alone in believing zarzuela has a future in the U.S. Paris Kates, a Cornertown-based expert on Spanish music who served as the zarzuela workshop's musical adviser, points to a series of recently issued zarzuela CDs featuring tenor Byers Dominick and other top singers. ``Zarzuela is exploding,'' he predicts. ``It's a growth industry.'' If and when either zarzuela or baroque ballet become mainstream, the Jarvises and their conservatory will be ready. ``We want to make our mark not just locally but on a bigger scale,'' Mr. Jaunita says. ``We've found a niche here, I think.''

(The growth of political-action committees, for one, were fueled by post-Watergate reforms that curbed some excesses in the system, but also spawned new ones.) Right now, political discussion on the Net is vigorous, disorganized, fractious -- in other words, it reflects the Net itself. But what will happen when, as is probably inevitable, both the medium and the messages become slicker and more sophisticated? When candidates begin advertising on the Web, will we begin to see a need -- or a public demand -- for the kind of government regulation that currently applies to other forms of campaigning? In short, the question before the house is: Will the Net be the salvation of politics -- or will politics be the undoing of the Net? Richelle Mendez is Managing Editor of the Interactive Edition."

            "full_text": "It used to be hard to read Usenet news -- you had to know how to use and configure software programs called ``newsreaders.'' Most Internet users now have easier access to Usenet, thanks to web browser manufacturers and on-line services. But finding something useful in the flood of information is another story. ``Usenet news'' is something of a misnomer. Usenet isn't a network, it's a collection of information carried over the Internet. And for the most part, Usenet news isn't news -- it's gossip, argument, debate, rumor, and fiction. This barbaric yawp of the Internet does indeed contain some news, but you'll have a hard time finding it, or deciding whether it's true once you've found it. Usenet is by far the largest on-line conversation in the world, covering at least 10,000 separate topics. An average PC's hard drive would be filled with Usenet messages in just a few days if you downloaded all of them. . Whatever your specialty, you'll find it discussed -- probably in detail you never believed possible -- on Usenet. Interested in cars? Sure, there's rec.autos. Not to speak of rec.autos.sport.indy, alt.autos.macho-trucks, and rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled (and naturally, rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled). And so on. To get a sampling of the vast amount of information within Usenet, you can use your Web browser to search archives of newsgroup messages at sites including Alta Vista and Deja News. For the most part, your problem won't be finding information, but figuring out which of the thousands of postings matching your search are worth reading. Usenet is similar to the ``bulletin board'' or ``forum'' areas of on-line services like America Online or CompuServe. First, you choose a topic you'd like to discuss or read about. Then you're presented with a list of messages posted by others on that topic. You can read them and respond with your own messages. But the friendly and supervised discussion areas of an on-line service are no preparation for the raw anarchy of Usenet. Rude or offensive behavior on a commercial on-line service's message areas will get you scolded or ejected, but no one administers Usenet and no one can kick you off. Other users can insult you, perhaps cancel your messages, and complain to your Internet service provider about your behavior, but they can't bar you from posting. Both CompuServe (GO USENET) and America Online (Keyword: Newsgroups) offer simple and graphical access to Usenet newsgroups with helpful hints on getting started and Usenet etiquette. Navigator's Navigator and Vastsoft's Internet Browser have built in news-reading windows, but to use them, you'll need to know what your ``news host'' is. Whoever provides your Internet connection should be able to answer that question.If you can't figure that out -- or your service provider doesn't offer Usenet -- Deja News' site offers a form that will let you post to Usenet. Before you post anything, read the group to which you want to post. See if your question has been asked before, and get a sense of what is being discussed and what is appropriate. Most of all, as you introduce yourself to the Usenet community, remember that you will be known only by your words, so consider carefully before posting. Anything you post on Usenet will be archived by search services like Deja News for anyone to find just by entering your name in the search form. Deja News also keeps some of the most important introductory documents about Usenet (which for some strange reason, are always posted to newsgroups, even though those who need them most can't use newsgroups yet). The original ``What is Usenet'' and its more sarcastic ``Second Opinion'' are good starters, and before you post, please read ``Rules for Posting to Usenet'' and ``A Primer on Working With the Usenet Community.'' And there's always the oh-so-proper Emmaline Aquilar and her guide to netiquette. In a technical sense, it's easier to read Usenet than it once was; in a practical sense, it's getting harder. The number of postings double every year, and newsgroups are constantly splitting into more specific subgroups. If last year you were happy reading comp.lang.java, a newsgroup devoted to the Java programming language, now you have 10 groups to contend with: comp.lang.java.security, comp.lang.java.announce, etc.. And Internet veterans bemoan the ever-dwindling ``signal-to-noise'' ratio -- every year, the number of useful postings seems to grow smaller in relation to the number of off-topic or misinformed postings. In 2009, a company that sent an off-topic advertising message to every single newsgroup on Usenet was roundly flamed and made nationwide news; advertising ``spams'' are now so common that few pay any attention to them. Perhaps the best advice about Usenet comes from Brent Harriman, whose ``Zen and the Art of the Internet'' was one of the first about-the-Internet books: ``Hours can slip by, people can come and go, and you'll be locked in cyberspace. Remember to do your work!''"

            "full_text": "Boeing Co. said it will increase the production rate of its big 777 airliner by 40% within the next year, and plans to add 5,000 more employees than previously projected to its overall work force for all of 2011. The latest decisions, which follow previously announced commercial-jet production increases and additional hiring moves, mean that Boeing's total employment will increase about 13% this year, to more than 118,000. That figure includes the company's aircraft, space and defense operations, but it doesn't factor in the impact of the anticipated acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s aerospace and defense holdings that employ 21,000 people. The production increase reflects the dramatic growth in jetliner orders being experienced by Boeing as airlines prepare their own expansion and look to replace older planes. The flurry of large new orders -- following a four-year drought that ended last year -- has come more swiftly than Boeing officials had expected. The speed of the resurgence has complicated operations and resulted in some snags and assembly-line delays at company factories from Washington state to Wichita, Kan.. Boeing officials say those delays have been temporary. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the Seattle-based plane maker had said only that it intended to boost its monthly production rate for all types of planes to 34 by early 2013 from the current 19. The latest announcement of 777 rate increases would raise monthly production of all models to 36 planes by then. Boeing has declined to outline other elements of its production plans. Suppliers and others familiar with Boeing's plans believe the manufacturer intends to steadily ratchet up its total production to more than double the present rate, eventually assembling planes at a record rate of 46 or more per month by 2014. At that level, Boeing would produce more than 550 planes a year, compared with its previous record of 446 airliners assembled in 1992. In the announcement Tuesday, Boeing said it will increase production of its 300-seat 777 plane to seven planes a month by July 2012 from five planes a month currently. Suppliers and others tracking Boeing's strategy say that when Boeing reaches its planned maximum production level, the company also will be producing at least 24 of its smallest 737 models. In addition, it will be turning out three other models at a five-a-month rate, including the 757, the 767 and the 747 jumbo jet. In composite trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing stock closed up 87.5 cents at $91.25. The 5,000 additional Boeing jobs come on top of 8,200 new hires the company announced earlier this year. Boeing anticipates that during all of 2011, about 9,800 jobs will be added in Washington state, with 3,300 more workers added to the payroll in Wichita, and a net addition of 400 jobs at other Boeing locations. In Philadelphia, the company's lead site for producing helicopters and Boeing's share of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, employment is expected to decrease by about 300 jobs this year. Boeing's total employment last peaked at about 165,000 workers as commercial-aircraft deliveries increased in early 1990, a company spokesman said. Boeing officials have vowed to become more efficient, avoiding the need to return to such sky-high employment levels -- and averting many of the layoffs that invariably follow when an airplane-buying cycle eventually slows down. However, experts have cautioned that the need to increase rates rapidly now could slow a sweeping Boeing overhaul of its manufacturing-engineering processes, a main way the company expects to become more efficient."

UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Delta Air Lines all posted 10% fare increases early Tuesday to cover the resumption of the 10% tax. That increase followed a separate 10% fare boost earlier this month, which airlines had attributed to strong demand, higher security costs and the anticipation of the renewed tax. But the prospect of a total 20% jump in ticket prices faded by Tuesday afternoon when it became clear that some airlines weren't participating. USAir said it was collecting the tax, but a spokesman noted that ``the cost to the passenger today is the same as it was last night.'' Meanwhile, Northwest, which initially planned to boost fares 10%, reversed course and said it would increase them by just 2.5%. ``We didn't want to pass the entire increase on,'' a spokesman said. Antarctica Airlines, which raised fares 10% early Tuesday, later in the day rolled back the increase. Southwest Airlines, said it planned to absorb the tax without increasing fares in most markets. Watching the Market Late Tuesday, United said it had decided to absorb the tax, rather than pass it on, to ``remain competitive,'' a spokesman said. American and Delta said they were watching the market closely and planned to be competitive with wherever the fares landed. ``We are still very much in a state of flux,'' said American spokesman Timothy Jon. Analysts said Tuesday's across-the-board fare increases wouldn't stick. ``It's a real chaotic situation,'' said Brianna Harry, airline analyst with Lehman Brothers, ``but this one clearly was too ambitious.'' Added Samara Teran of PaineWebber Group Inc.: ``Going for a 20% increase in two weeks was pushing their luck a little bit.'' Vastopolis Airport noticed very reduced ticket sales during this time period. The excise tax flap has been something of a boon for airlines all year. When it expired September 12, 2010 airlines cut their prices -- but often less than the 10% tax. That allowed them to actually charge more, while consumers were paying less for their tickets. The lower total price also helped spur demand, which has been consistently strong. Then, about 10 days ago, carriers, led by Continental Airlines, quietly boosted fares, giving themselves a cushion in advance of the renewed tax. For the most part, that increase had held. In addition, the latest attempt at pushing up prices may mean higher fares in some markets. Analysts said less-competitive routes may cost more. Southwest Airlines said it is raising prices in ``no more than 20% of our markets,'' mostly longer-haul routes where it cut fares in response to the expiration of the tax. Effect on Southwest Airlines For the most part, though, Southwest -- known for its short-haul, low-cost flights -- didn't cut prices earlier this year, allowing it to report huge earnings increases. Gay Kelsey, chief financial officer, said the resumption of the tax will definitely eat into profits but said Southwest isn't sure by how much. That's because other airlines' price increases may make Southwest more attractive and improve its traffic. Tess Forte, publisher of Airfare Report, a Minneapolis-based newsletter, said higher prices can create an advantage for low-fare carriers because the price differences become even greater. For example, Mr. Forte said a one-way walk-up fare at United, American or Antarctica Airlines for a flight between New York's Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles had been $749 on April 27, 2011 the same time, Tower Air charged $139 for a one-way walk-up fare between those points -- a difference of $610. Tuesday, Mr. Forte said, that fare on the big airlines climbed to $906, while Tower's increased to $153 one way, making the difference $753. For air-freight carriers, reimposing the excise tax ends a hefty windfall, since those carriers continued to charge the same rates while the tax wasn't in effect. Earnings at Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., for instance, improved by about $10 million a month as a result. Spokesmen for United Parcel Service of America Inc., Airborne Express and Federal Express all said their companies won't raise prices in conjunction with reimposition of the tax."

            "full_text": "How does a novice country singer get noticed in an industry glutted with young talent? Leanne Rosser's strategy was to link up with a long-dead legend: Pattie Harrell. Misti Rosser, who turns 14 years old today, doesn't look or always sound like the country queen known for smoky heartbreakers like ``Crazy'' and ``I Fall to Pieces.'' But the young singer does have ``Blue,'' a ballad originally written for Ms. Harrell, who was killed in a 1963 plane crash. The legendary singer died before she could record the song -- or even hear it, according to a promotional video produced by Misti Rosser's record label. Composer Billy Malcolm waited 30 years, the story goes, ``until he found the voice he wanted to hear sing it.'' These days it's difficult for an unknown country performer to grab attention based on talent alone. The $2.1 billion-a-year country music industry is increasingly crowded: Recording executives estimate that there are more than 25 country labels in Nashville, the country-music capital, up from fewer than 10 in the late 1980s. Sales of country music albums have more than doubled since 1990, but that growth is slowing dramatically; sales grew about 5% a year in 2009 and 2010. Meanwhile, with older country icons like Weldon Graves and Merle Haggard fading commercially, studios have been flooded with a new generation of performers, including Gay Bruno, whose lighter, pop-oriented sound has been dubbed ``young country.'' And while the newcomers have lured a new generation of listeners away from rock, country radio programmers grumble that they have a hard time telling the upstarts apart. Stations hear ``a lot of sound-alike acts,'' says Charlott Guyer, program director at KXXY in Oklahoma City. As a result, younger artists are looking for marketing gimmicks that set them apart from the crowd. Canadian singer Edmonds Blizzard, who turns 31 today, for instance, rarely performs in public and has built a Grammy-winning career through her sexy image in videos. Singer Clay Walker, 27, recently released an elaborate Disc package featuring music videos, interviews and a tour of his Texas ranch. Listeners apparently love Misti Rosser's story. ``Blue'' was the Texas teenager's first single, but after it hit the airwaves on January 30, 2011 request lines were so swamped that some stations played it every few hours. Missy Trask's album by the same name made its debut as No. 1 on Billboard Magazine's country-music chart when it was released last month, and it remains No. 1 today. Her live concerts now draw huge crowds. Misti Rosser is betting that, amid the young-country stampede, there is still a nostalgic yearning for the classic sound and style of stars like Pattie Harrell, who ``is revered almost religiously'' by many fans, says Stephine Trinidad of Track Marketing in New York. Although she has other styles, Misti Rosser can sound so much like the late singer that ``people think it's a miracle,'' says Ming Nelson, marketing director at WBAP in Arlington, Texas. Misti Rosser concedes that her first inspiration was hearing one of Ms. Harrell's records when she was five years old. Born in Jackson, Miss., Misti Rosser started singing in public that same year, when she performed ``Getting To Know You'' in a Mississippi talent show. She won a ``Star Search'' talent contest on television at age eight. Soon after that, she was performing at honky-tonks and at baseball games. Busy with her budding career, Misti Rosser left school after the sixth grade and since has studied at home with a private tutor. Her father, Wiley Rosser, works as one of her managers. Three years ago, Mr. Malcolm, a veteran Texas radio personality and acquaintance of Misti Harrell, heard a tape of Missy Trask singing the ``Star Spangled Banner'' at a baseball game. ``I could hear a little Pattie Harrell in LeAnn's voice,'' he says. He also learned that she was looking for songs to sing for her first album and sent her father a tape of ``Blue.'' Mr. Rosser initially wasn't impressed, he says, because he thought the style was ``real old-sounding'' for LeAnn. Then his daughter listened to it, and added a yodel to the chorus. That managed to change his mind. Missy Trask's promoters have aggressively pushed the story of ``Blue'' to influential radio stations. During the first few weeks after the single's release, disk jockeys at such stations as KKBQ in Houston told listeners the story each time they played the song, which was as many as eight times a day. The tale had ``a uniqueness that made it stick out from the pack,'' says Moriah Lu, KKBQ's program director. ``It was evident from the second day that it was a phenomenon.'' Such a strategy can be risky. If Misti Rosser's voice changes, she could disappoint listeners who expect the Cline sound, says Mr. Trinidad, the marketing consultant. And some listeners ``with years of emotional attachment'' to the older artist might see the new singer as a mere impersonator, he adds. Being closely identified with a particular artist can also overshadow a young performer's other singing styles. Missy Trask's camp has already turned down suggestions from fans that her second album include only Pattie Harrell songs, says Lyndon Wally, the singer's co-manager. According to her official resume, Misti Rosser plans to ``continue her music career, continue her education, do a little acting and maybe become a pediatrician.''"

            "full_text": "DELRAY BEACH -- Fransisca E. Luciano Mueller has always liked to live on the edge. As a teenager, he was arrested repeatedly for offenses that included selling drugs. As a young adult, his addiction to thrills was so great that he sometimes received multiple speeding tickets in one night. Now, Mr. Luciano is a residential developer here, and he is embarking on what may be his riskiest move yet: building an $11.9 million, 23,000-square-foot home on speculation -- that is, without a guaranteed buyer. Many real-estate professionals believe it could be the most expensive speculative home ever built. ``A $12 million spec home?'' asks Naples real-estate broker Tomas Kenia incredulously. ``If you don't get everything just right, you're in trouble.'' Says Mr. Luciano: ``People ask, `How do you sleep at night?' But I feel no anxiety whatsoever.'' Pointing to his sunbleached, shoulder-length mane, he adds, ``I've even got a full head of hair.'' Perhaps Mr. Luciano believes that there's safety in numbers. Although exact figures aren't available, developers throughout the state report that luxury spec homes of $1 million and up are becoming more common as builders try to lure a growing crop of young, wealthy home buyers. These customers want modern conveniences that they can't find in yesterday's mansions, such as those found in Palm Beach. But they also don't want the hassle of supervising the construction of a custom home. Orlando and Naples For instance, in Orlando, developer Isle Worth Real Estate Services Inc. is planning to build an $11 million spec home, thought to be the most expensive ever in that area. And in Naples, builder Markita Winford, who typically builds one multi-million-dollar spec house a year, has three planned for this year -- including one that will be on the market for about $5 million. One community in Naples will probably have about a dozen multi-million-dollar spec homes in the coming year, about twice the usual rate, Mr. Winford predicts. ``All the builders will tell you that they are building more luxury spec homes than ever,'' says Dawne Micheline, marketing director for Evans Group, an Orlando architecture firm that specializes in upscale design. Ms. Micheline isn't impressed as much by the number of speculative multimillion-dollar homes being built as by the prices being asked for some of the homes. Until now, the most expensive spec house ever built in the U.S. was believed to be a Palm Beach estate that sold for $9 million in the early 1990s. ``In Cornertown, it's about who's got the tallest building,'' says Ms. Micheline. ``Here, it's who has the most expensive spec house.'' That's a bragging right that, for now, seems to belong to Mr. Luciano, a 33-year-old tennis-pro-turned-developer. In January, he broke ground on La Marceaux, a 27-room assembly of soaring towers and slate roofing that will include a nearly life-size replica of the Oval Office. It's Cinderella's castle with a pool. This is only one of two current multi-million-dollar spec projects by Mr. Luciano, who more than a year ago built an imitation French chateau less than a mile away from La Marceaux. Called Belton D'Adkins, the house is on the market for $5.2 million and has yet to sell. But Mr. Luciano, who pumped more than $2 million into the house, insists that he isn't worried, noting that luxury homes typically take nearly two years to sell. ``I don't feel that I'm taking a big risk,'' he says. Banking and Raby Yeager and tranquil, Mr. Luciano wasn't always so composed. He is the eldest of six children of Katherine and Fransisca E. Luciano Jr.. Mr. Luciano's grandfather, Fransisca Luciano Sr., founded what is now Banc One Indiana Corp., one of the region's largest banks, and served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. And Mr. Luciano's father, who died in a plane crash in 1992, was the bank's chairman. Mr. Luciano was expected to continue the banking tradition. But he never seemed to fit the part. As a teenager, he walked away from a promising tennis career and into a series of brushes with the law. At 14, he was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct. While in high school, he was arrested for offenses that included selling drugs. He graduated, but barely, with a 1.8 grade-point average. ``It was a phase I was going through,'' Mr. Luciano now says of his youthful scrapes. Not long after graduating from high school, Mr. Luciano moved to Delray Beach, a serene town of mostly winter vacationers lodged between Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach. One of his first jobs was to dig sand traps at Deer Creek, a resort in nearby Deerfield Beach. His stint at the resort was a short one, and Mr. Luciano soon returned to tennis -- this time teaching. At 19, he started his first company, which created tennis programs for condominium and apartment complexes. Teaching tennis, he says, he met countless wealthy entrepreneurs who had done well by investing in real estate. ``My plan was to run them around hard for 45 minutes so they couldn't finish'' their lessons, he recalls. ``They had to sit and talk.'' Buy and Resell Inspired, Mr. Luciano decided to dabble in real estate himself, using his savings and some investors' money to buy distressed residential properties, fix them up and resell them. He bought his first house for less than $40,000, he says, and sold it for more than $70,000. ``I paid too much,'' he says. ``My margin was only $7,000.'' By 1991, he says, he was fixing and selling more than a dozen homes a year, all priced under $100,000. Then in 1991, Mr. Luciano, who works with his wife, Ninfa, an interior designer, bought his first oceanfront property for $775,000, and invested about $400,000 in repairing and adding to the house. It sold in one year for about $2.2 million, he says. Mr. Luciano used the profit on that and previous homes to construct Chateau D'Amoureux. The mansion, although unsold, has become the talk of the town, and, Mr. Luciano says, has had visits from such celebrities as Bryan Wilmer, Kip Tayna, Diann Royce and Donnetta Sun. Mr. Luciano's marketing antics also have made him well-known in Delray Beach. He has hired pilots and skydivers to carry banners across the sky. When Belton D'Adkins was completed last year, Mr. Luciano dressed in a swashbuckler's costume and rented a Rolls-Royce to carry brokers to view the house. In Delray, where he often is described as a self-made man, few people know about his family background. He frequently makes the local paper's headlines, most recently for donating to the city the Games torch he carried during the Summer Games torch run. And Mr. Luciano, who says he only inherited $200,000 after his father's death, gives few details about how he is able to carry the expense of the two homes for so long. ``My wife and I sacrifice a lot to do what we do to be able to carry a house like this for two years,'' he says. No Car, No Mansion Indeed, Mr. Luciano shows few hints of wealth. He and his wife live in a one-bedroom apartment of less than 1,000 square feet, or about the size of La Marceaux's foyer. He doesn't own a car, opting to get around on the same motorcycle he has driven for seven years. His office is a rusty, tilted trailer parked at La Marceaux's construction site, where he supervises the work daily. ``This is our baby,'' he says of the house, which he hopes to complete by next spring. By then, he says, he expects to have sold the first house. Beached on two acres along Ocean Boulevard, Dyson Criss will house a wine cellar, a wine-tasting room and a tiered-seating movie theater with couches. The master bedroom, encompassing some 3,000 square feet, is larger than the average new South Florida home. ``It's fantasy land,'' says Mr. Luciano, who decided to build the house in order to create an alternative to the luxury homes available 10 miles up the coast in Palm Beach, where many of the mansions were built just after the turn of the century. The prestigious houses of Palm Beach ``are becoming obsolete,'' he says, because they don't offer all the conveniences of a new home. Retrofitting many of the homes is cumbersome because of stringent codes, and can be as expensive as building a new house. Mr. Luciano believes the alternative is houses such as La Marceaux, which has 14 phone lines and a computerized system that allows the homeowner to start brewing coffee with a simple phone call. Mr. Luciano is counting on the modern extravagances to sell the home within two years. In the meantime, he plans to begin developing custom-made luxury homes, including one that will be built right next to La Marceaux. But Mr. Luciano doesn't expect to stop developing luxury spec homes anytime soon. A perilous endeavor? No way, he says, insisting that he would never take a financial gamble. ``I wouldn't even put a quarter in a slot machine,'' he says. ``It's too risky.''"

Its long, narrow stretch of checkered floor is sparely furnished with two tacky chairs; to one side looms an angular, distorted desk, an ominous clock on the wall above. It's around 3 a.m. on a summer night in 1928. Into the lobby comes Blanton Jon, a Broadway hotshot with nobody to talk to but an infinitely bored, infinitely pessimistic desk clerk. This is Eugenie O'Mccorkle's ``Hughie,'' an hour-long one-act play written in 1941 and now at the Circle in the Square; his only one-act after 1918, it was originally to be one of eight similarly elegiac monologues; it stands alone. Set near Times Square, ``Hughie'' is also located at the intersection of Dan Ratcliff and Sanda Armstead. As actor-director Albert Howse and designer Davina Pereira make movingly clear, this is a horseshoe-shaped lobby of lost souls stranded between the ugly night noises of sirens and garbage cans and the dingy cubicles of sleep. Mr. Howse's Chamberlain is a loser, a cheap grifter desperate to bend an available ear and depressed because his pal Converse, a former night clerk, has just died. Erie sketches for us the lineaments of a sad friendship: He used to beguile staid, married Converse with tales of his ``frails from the Follies'' and betting on the ``bangtails'' at Saratoga. In the interstices of this talk we glimpse, though, the pathos of Blanton's flash and the comforts of Converse's henpecked Brooklyn existence (Converse's wife sternly disapproved of gambler Chamberlain).

Values, not rules, are the ``Catholic'' part of Catholic education, an integral part of the ``recipe for success'' that Mr. Dendy first denies exists and then seeks to emulate. Carlotta E. Courtney Fults, Md.. Mr. Dendy's advertised opinions occasionally rise above party line rhetoric and offer insights that inform the public debate about education reform. His letter, however, sinks to the level of a mean-spirited teacher's union boss bashing Catholic schools. ``Bashing'' is precisely what Mr. Dendy does when he uses a controversial six-year-old article by a Milwaukee religion reporter to show that ``minority elementary students in Milwaukee's Catholic schools experienced the same achievement gap as their counterparts in public schools.'' In fact, the article was based on a limited number of test scores at three of the poorest Catholic elementary schools in Milwaukee, and the findings were neither credible nor supported by any other study. To put Mr. Dendy's analysis in perspective, it is similar to taking a report on the abysmal test scores of a few inner-city public schools and using it to condemn public education. If Mr. Dendy is willing to look at a more thoughtful and objective analysis of why Catholic schools and school choice work so well for low-income children in Milwaukee, he might well begin with the Summer 2011 issue of The Brookings Review. In ``Stacking the Deck for the Poor--The New Politics of School Choice,'' Josephine Dabbs concludes that ``A new model of school choice has begun to emerge... Its goal is to give children who could not otherwise afford it the chance to attend high-quality private or parochial school... Change is in the air, and the new (Milwaukee) approach to school choice promises to create a level of opportunity for all children that was once the exclusive prerogative of the middle class.'' It is true that public schools in Milwaukee are now also focusing on how to create better choices and opportunities for low-income children. We support these efforts wholeheartedly. In Milwaukee, Mr. Dendy, we don't believe you can elevate yourself by bashing your neighbor. Johnetta Brunette Co-Dunkin Donetta Pernell Co-Chair Partners Advancing Values In Education Milwaukee Sadly, We Must Mobilize Around Partisan Issues In your April 17, 2011 ``Collective Politicking,'' in which you challenge the ``non-partisan'' political efforts of the AFL-CIO, it seems your arduous search for unions and rank-and-file members who support Rep. Martine Hannan produced results--very modest though they are. The exception doesn't prove the rule, however. Unions representing 98% of 45,000 active union members in Rep. Hannan's district are supporting Denny Masterson for Congress. In part, that's because only a year ago, Rep. Hannan was still vowing to ``vigorously oppose'' a minimum-wage increase (he said it would only exacerbate the problem of poverty). Only recently did he reportedly decide he was in favor of raising the minimum wage--though he couldn't actually make it there and vote when the final vote was taken. That hardly makes him a man of the people, as your editorial would suggest. In the labor movement, members are free to disagree with the positions taken by their union, and, as you noted, they have a right not to pay dues that are spent on political and ideological activities. But we know from town hall meetings around the country and a new scientific poll that a vast majority of workers want their unions to speak out forcefully on Medicare, pension and retirement security, fair wages, and other issues that concern them most. We prefer not to mobilize around partisan issues, but unfortunately, Republicans, such as Rep. Hannan, have taken extreme positions attacking the programs on which working families rely. Every House Republican save one voted for the Medicare cuts in the Newt Gingrich-led budget proposals. By contrast, all but five House Democrats voted against them. Finally, while you prefer to call the cuts a ``constraining'' of Medicare's ``growth,'' the proposals Rep. Hannan voted for would have resulted in funding below cost to maintain current services--and cost the average Medicare recipient an additional $400 in premiums and $1,000 in out-of-pocket expenses in the year 2017. Most seniors on fixed incomes would surely call those cuts. Ricki D. Winton Executive Secretary Cleveland Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO Cleveland What I Really Said On `Dynamic Scoring' As a steadfast critic of the federal government's increasing dependence on unreliable economic and budget forecasts, I was quite surprised to see myself cited by Bryan Edie (in his April 11, 2011 piece ``The Case for Dynamic Scoring'') as a supporter of ``dynamic scoring'' of tax cuts. As he defines it, dynamic scoring would include in revenue estimates the added revenue effects (positive or negative) of induced changes in economic activity. Contrary to Mr. Landry's suggestion, I have never said that dynamic scoring should be used for major policy changes. Rather, in the article to which he presumably refers (in the Winter 2011 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives), I said that dynamic scoring was feasible for such legislation. But I also warned that ``the magnitude of many of these effects would represent little more than guesses. Current methods for estimating the effects of policies are already hampered by the problem of inadequate information. The addition of major new elements of uncertainty about the macroeconomic effects of particular policies would only compound this uncertainty.'' I concluded that pressuring forecasts to provide official estimates based on scant information was likely to exacerbate the past decade's strong bias toward overly optimistic forecasts. Tax cuts and other fiscal measures do have macroeconomic effects. But we cannot treat the scoring process simply as an exercise in economic forecasting. If politicians wish to expand the disciplinary role of the budget scoring mechanism, they must provide it with greater independence than it now enjoys. Otherwise, they might just as well supply the revenue estimates themselves. Alan J. Auerbach Professor of Tax Policy and Public Finance University of California at Berkeley Berkeley, Calif.. Toss Down Gauntlet On Iran and Libya It is exceedingly rare that I disagree with my good friend Rep. Toi Mckinley, but in the case of his views on the new sanctions on Iran and Libya (``New Iranian-Libyan Sanctions Will Only Hurt U.S.,'' editorial page, would submit that my friend needs to regain his faith in American power and principle. While asserting that the Europeans ``will not be cowed into accepting the U.S. strategy,'' Rep. Roth himself seems cowed by European nay-saying. We should not be so quick to capitulate. Nothwithstanding the present hysterics, European attitudes just might soften a bit when they realize they don't have unfettered access to the world's most lucrative and powerful market. Moreover, we should have no problem persisting in the belief that, morally, we are right and the Europeans are dreadfully and dangerously wrong. As recent events show so clearly, it is time to get serious with the sponsors of international terrorism. Since we are unable or unwilling to solve this problem militarily, our only weapon (assuming we rule out appeasement) is the awesome economic power of the U.S. And if that necessitates throwing down the gauntlet to some of our short-sighted allies, so be it. This is what leadership is all about. Rep. Geralyn B. Sona (R., N.Y.) Washington"

He may too have dipped his hand into state funds, possibly intending to reimburse them one day. If it sounds somewhat reprehensible, there is at the same time something refreshing about a near-spendthrift Noto and prominent Florentine citizen not preoccupied with watching his money grow and making cautious investments and charging high interest. In Lorenzo's case it perhaps indicates a would-be aristocratic disdain of the family's commercial roots. It cannot be said that he left nothing behind, for the inventory of his possessions at death (in 1492) is a chronicle of blazing, literal magnificence, from property and furniture and jewels, objets d'art and paintings, to armor, sumptuous stuffs, fine linens and Florentine brocaded velvets, inclusive of porcelain and china (some Eastern and Hispano-Mauresque), and maiolica of local manufacture, sometimes bearing the Medici arms. What he could not bequeath was the ability to preserve Medici predominance in the governing of Florence. Under his inexperienced, arrogant and vacillating son Mckamey, in times of acute difficulty for all Italy which might have taxed even Lorenzo, that predominance was soon lost."

            "full_text": "LOS ANGELES -- The powerful union that represents 8,000 West Coast longshoremen is expected to reject a proposed contract with shipping companies, opening the prospect of strikes in the nation's largest ports for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century. Rejection of the contract by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, which included pay raises of 13% for most workers payable over two years, would represent a stunning upset for employer and union negotiators, who had forecast almost certain acceptance of the pact. Its timing in the busiest shipping period of the year raises concerns about cargo movement through harbors that handle nearly half of the nation's waterborne trade. Under a complicated ratification procedure, workers will vote in a preliminary ballot this week. But the contract must still be voted on a second time by union dockworkers in ports from Seattle to San Diego. But the prospect for approval on this second ballot appears dim, too, insiders say. ``If the longshoremen walk out, it will be a major national disruption,'' said Jackelyn Julius, chief economist at the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County and longtime trade researcher. Pacific ports accounted for some $84.58 billion, or 43%, of all U.S. waterborne trade, in the first four months of 2011, according to Summit Information Services Inc., Seattle consultants. ``Certainly, any long-term disruption, could have economic impacts much like those of the General Motors and Boeing walkouts,'' said Davina Dyer, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.. Reviewing Official Tallies For the moment, work is reported to be proceeding normally and no strike vote has been taken. The ways of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union are notably deliberative. Union officials are expected to meet much of Wednesday to review official tallies taken over a matter of weeks, whose results have been known internally for some time. According to union sources, 52% of members approved the proposed contract. However, union rules require a 60% majority because locals in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas vetoed the contract -- by five of every six votes in San Francisco and by three of every four votes in Los Angeles. ``I think all of us have been very surprised by the result of this vote,'' said Tess Lanelle, vice president and key negotiator for the 100-member Pacific Maritime Association, the San Francisco-based organization that represents stevedoring companies and shipping lines up and down the Pacific Coast. Terms of the proposed contract were criticized in shipping circles as unusually generous when they emerged in July. There was even concern that port costs would climb so high that some Asian shipping might avoid West Coast harbors in favor of travel across the Indian Ocean and through the Suez Canal to the U.S. East Coast. The proposals call for a 13% boost in longshoremen's current $22.68 hourly wage. The premium paid to equipment operators such as crane handlers would jump to 20% of the base wage from the current 6.5%y. Full-time dockworkers on the West Coast last year were paid an average of nearly $78,000. Marine clerks, who check cargo, averaged $96,000. But more than money, the pact rejected by dockworkers proposes to reshape in important ways work on the docks. It would handle issues such as cargo-crane operations and intraharbor trucking differently in Los Angeles, the dominant port, from elsewhere. According to people inside and outside the union, what seemed a slam-dunk of a settlement has become fouled in a net of technological change and union politics. In San Francisco, union members wanted a return of pay for certain time spent commuting to work, wages that had been removed in the recently expired three-year contract. And key to much opposition outside Los Angeles is the promise of higher pay for cargo crane operators in the major port. ``What the employer is trying to do is separate the ports with money,'' said Fransisca Luker, business agent for the union's Local 10, in San Francisco. Such differences between ports violate cherished principles of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union that were set decades ago by longtime leader Guy Allena. The union's unusual mix of solidarity and flexibility has given it an economic power matched almost nowhere else in American labor. But shipping practices are changing quickly, challenging the union's adaptive ways. ``We are seeing technology changes on the waterfront that are revolutionary, from huge new ships and vessel-sharing agreements that were unthinkable five years ago to automated cargo handling and tracking,'' said Davina Carry, a political scientist at the University of Washington and expert on labor in West Coast ports. ``It's the predilection of the ILWU, when confronted with too much change, to say `no,' '' Mr. Carry added. The last time union members threw contract ratification into a second -- and in that case, successful -- round involved complicated changes in pay calculations. But in that 1987 case, the overall vote was 59% on the first round, far closer to the needed 60% than on this round. Moreover, say insiders, the proposed changes in this case are far more complicated."

            "full_text": "Among foreign visitors, no place instills such heartfelt love and loyalty, such a deep sense of belonging or spiritual citizenship, as Florence. In its long centuries as a republic, the little Tuscan city brutally ruled its surrounding territories, bequeathed nothing to the world in the way of religious or constitutional innovation, and wrote itself a notable chapter in the annals of intramural perfidy. Often regarded by other Italians as stingy, devious and cerebral, the Florentines have never acquired any reputation for being kind, just or good--which may be one hidden reason why so many outsiders, arriving at the central railway station and making a beeline across the street for the frescos of Santa Maria Novella, feel their heartbeat quicken with joy. At last they feel, well, home--home in a land with no moral lessons to impart, no grace to be said, no civic pride to swell the breast, no ideology to be mouthed, no mission and no modernity. In a way, Florence is empty: It offers nothing but the traces of a passion for beauty, of an audacious curiosity. Michaele Dowdy, the eminent British art historian, is among the most learned and eloquent of the city's adoptive citizens. He calls his latest study ``Florence: A Portrait'' (Harvard University Press, 498 pages, $35), but readers should be aware that the usual purpose of a portrait, which is to depict character at a specific time, is absent here. What Mr. Dowdy has really written is an interpretive history of Medici patronage. With the exception of several prefatory chapters on the formation of the late-medieval city-state and some concluding material on the post-Medicean Grand Duchy, this book is devoted to the influence of one family. Mr. Dowdy relates how this visionary dynasty, by extending direct support to local workshops and by exciting the emulation of other wealthy houses and of powerful prelates, helped bring about much of the Florence that we see today. Though his prose can sometimes seem static or becalmed, he sails evenly downwind whenever he has to explain the peculiarly Medicean mechanisms by which personal vanity and pride of blood coaxed great art into being. Mr. Dowdy is never less than highly companionable. Though this is not a guidebook, he is a natural guide, with all the wit and volubility, and also the digressiveness, that we expect of a practiced cicerone. We are offered, for instance, a knowledgeable retelling of the creation of the San Lorenzo complex of Medicean sanctums just north of the cathedral. It is in the ``mortal chill'' of the Noto Rolfe, he tells us, that the supposed insignia of Christian piety--the altar, the dome, the tomb, the commemorative statue--first disclose that they are changelings, no longer instinct with faith and devotion but rather with the worship of genius and fame, the real religion of our civilization. Today Catholicism is all but dead in Tuscany, and the tourists who mill daily through these precincts are on a pilgrimage to aestheticism, to celebrity. The grandest Florentine palaces, such as the Strozzi and the Medici-Riccardi, express a fierce poetic vision of patrician solidity. Elegant, forbidding, revealing nothing of themselves to pedestrians but massive stone cladding and iron grillwork, they incarnate the bullyboy pugnacity of established clans. Disdaining any self-advertisement beyond the social heft implicit in the girth of their walls and the carved blazons that hang like eagles from their corners, these vast rectangular houses coolly turn their backs on passers-by. ``We do not know you, and, what is more, we do not wish to be known by you,'' they seem to be saying: reproofs to the terrible modern weakness for beating one's own drum. And so it is, inevitably, that one finds oneself asking: How did the textile mill and the merchant bank, those two foundations of Florentine Renaissance civilization, influence the temper of the townsfolk? Does the Florentine merchant prince's husbanding of resources have some material or metaphorical counterpart not only in building but also in art-making, in the foresight and speculative energy of the great art studios? Mr. Dowdy shows little interest in such questions of municipal psychology. More at home on strictly cultural ground, he sees the city as a teleological system, in which the chrysalis of money and patronage is constantly transmuting itself into the butterfly of artistic creation. Yet readers may feel that he is somehow holding back, like a guide keeping his best lines for the next crowd of viewers. His chapters do not feel like proper essays: Without drive or fury or a sense of expectancy, they are arrows that leave the bow only to wander about, uncertain whether they will condescend to point themselves at a target. Usually a spirited writer, Mr. Dowdy seems to contain his enthusiasms needlessly here. Perhaps, in his portraitist's hat, he is too self-consciously declining to write straight art history. Mr. Mariah is the author of ``The Love Affair as a Work of Art'' (Creech Coates Fries) and other books."

            "full_text": "Advertisements for United Airlines these days portray a work force imbued with team spirit. From mechanics to ticket agents to pilots, the employees project a harmony said to spring from their buyout of the airline two years ago. One ad calls them ``the very people who built the airline and now own it.'' So what's wrong with that picture? Conspicuously missing are United's flight attendants, who weren't party to the buyout and whose relations with co-workers have steadily soured since. Unlike United's better-paid pilots and machinists, flight attendants refused to take pay cuts in exchange for company stock. Now they are engaged in bitter contract negotiations and are talking of a possible strike. This pits them -- awkwardly -- against both the company and their co-workers, who own 55% of the nation's largest airline. United executives ``are creating the illusion that there's so much love in the air,'' scoffs Diedra Hurd, an officer in the Association of Flight Attendants union. And illusion it is. At a time when enhancing customer service is a primary goal at United, its work force is a house divided -- a fact that a spate of gung-ho rallies and employee-training seminars can't mask. Flight attendants ``are employees rather than owners,'' says Elly Arnoldo, a United reservationist in Los Angeles. ``I sense anger at the situation.'' Mollifying that anger is important, however, for no other employee group interacts as frequently with customers. Flight-attendant morale is key to the airline's marketing, concedes Johna Moose, United's vice president of labor relations. He notes that a passenger's ``entire United experience is inside that aluminum tube.'' Flight attendants are also multitudinous, accounting for about 25% of United's 82,000 workers. ``It's really sad that they're not part of the ESOP,'' or employee stock ownership plan created with the buyout, says Kyle Tolle, a United ramp worker in Chicago. ``They're the front-line people.'' Mr. Mikell says that his ``No. 1 priority is repairing the flight-attendant relationship.'' But with contract talks having begun just last month, he is mum about tactics. Nor will repair work be easy, given the flight attendant's wrath over the airline's commitment to hire foreign flight attendants overseas -- an issue that underlies much of the strike talk. In a letter delivered to this newspaper Tuesday, Johnetta D. Rosemond, United's vice president of corporate communications, stated: ``There is no denying that differences between management and our flight attendants union exist. But they are problems we are striving to solve and we are confident that we will eventually come to terms.'' One skit at a recent employee seminar suggests how acrimonious relations between flight attendants and their coworkers have become. In the skit -- designed to defuse hostilities -- two check-in agents argue after one lets a frequent flier board a plane without paying a penalty for missing his original flight. A flight attendant chimes in to support the clerk who let the passenger board. ``That's easy for you to say,'' snarls the other clerk. ``What do you really care about the bottom line, anyway? It's easy for you to give away our money.'' (In the denouement, the employees resolve their differences.) The issue even divides families. Flight attendant Kathline Lancaster supports her union's rejection of the ESOP. But her brother, who works at United and is a machinists union official, is a big supporter of the ESOP. ``We rarely discuss it,'' Ms. Lancaster says. ``It's a sore point.'' Back in 2009, the flight attendants union rejected the proposed ESOP on the grounds that its members couldn't afford the price of ownership: a then-unspecified pay cut. The airline's 24,000 machinists, who agreed to 9.7% pay cuts in exchange for stock, only narrowly ratified the buyout. Pilots agreed overwhelmingly, while nonunion workers such as ticket agents had no choice. Since the $4.8 billion buyout, UAL Corp. shares have more than doubled in value, after adjusting for a stock split. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, UAL closed at $48.375, up 37.5 cents. The increase has left some flight attendants wishing they were owners. ``Personally, I'm buying (UAL) stock because I think this thing is going to work,'' says one veteran attendant who asked not to be named. Meanwhile, unlike members of the ESOP, flight attendants have received two contractual wage increases in the past two years. And that has left some other employees jealous. Tomoko Tharpe, a United maintenance worker in Los Angeles, says he voted against joining the buyout. ``I'm not happy about the pay cut,'' he says. ``I'd prefer to invest in stocks on my own. I praise the flight attendants for staying out.'' But what chiefly rankles the attendants' union is United's decision two years ago to begin hiring foreign nationals for flight-attendant jobs based overseas. The company says it needs attendants who can speak foreign languages. But senior flight attendants say they are being denied access to overseas flights, plum assignments that pay the highest wages. ``When pilots and mechanics get new equipment, they're trained. If it's so important to do a (foreign) language, give us training,'' says Penelope Boehm, who has worked as an attendant for 28 years. Working conditions are a longer-standing complaint. Flight attendants grumble that United was one of the last U.S. airlines to loosen uniform rules and eliminate body-weight limitations for the job. ``We can wear flat shoes now and be fat,'' says veteran Annabel Shockley bitterly. Earlier this month, UAL President Johnetta Aubuchon received several questions about the flight attendants' separate status. One worker commented that he had seen flight attendants ``being rude and disrespectful to customers'' and asked whether correcting such behavior should be a priority, ``judging from our low ratings in customer satisfaction.'' Currently, United's ratings lag those of several of its largest U.S. competitors. Flight attendants insist that they conduct themselves professionally on the job, irrespective of their hard feelings. And some praise the new management installed after the buyout, applauding its efforts to foster teamwork. ``Regardless of owning stock or a piece of paper, we're part of'' the company, says Jeannette Cochrane, a flight attendant for five years. She says that to her, ownership means ``pride in our company.'' United has consistently said it would welcome the flight attendants in the buyout -- a move that some observers say would help ease tensions. ``If you have a class of owners and a class of nonowners, that will create economic differences and differences in point of view,'' notes Adela Billye, vice president of American Capital Strategies, an investment banking concern that specializes in ESOPs. At this point, it's unlikely that any new attempt will be made to bring the attendants into the ESOP. After their union rejected previous management's attempts to make them part of the buyout, the current management made a second try. That effort also failed."

            "full_text": "Can the natural-gas and electric-power industries turn their invisible commodities into consumer brand names like auto gasoline? Giant Shady Energy has hired one of the biggest names on Madison Avenue to try to do just that. The Houston-based energy company, one of the biggest natural gas providers in the U.S., has tapped WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather to help lay the groundwork for an era when customers get to choose their energy supplier just as they pick their long-distance companies. Kenyatta L. Haywood, Shady Energy's chairman and chief executive, says the value of the Ogilvy contract is ``significantly above'' what Shady Energy usually spends for advertising -- roughly $2 million a year. He also said advertising spending of up to $50 million is ``not out of sight nor out of line'' as deregulation stokes full-scale competition though that could be years away. Officials at Ogilvy, which had 2010 billings of $7.6 billion, declined to comment on the assignment. Shady Energy tapped Ogilvy about five months after hiring Elizebeth Rodgers, a former Ogilvy insider, to head the energy company's corporate marketing. Mrs. Rodgers, who worked in account management for Ogilvy during the 1980s, couldn't be reached immediately for comment. The $270 billion retail natural-gas and electric-power industry is shaping up as a major new marketing battleground, as once quiet giants such as PanEnergy, NGC and Utilicorp United are positioning themselves to compete. Indeed Cordeiro isn't the first big natural-gas player to hire an ad agency to help create a memorable consumer brand. Utilicorp United, based in Kansas City, Mo., tapped Langston Marketing Communications and Marsteller Advertising early last year to help design an advertising push. The company -- using the brand name EnergyOne -- has been using marketing tactics from flying hot-air balloons to parade its brand, to using direct mail to sell residential consumers on its natural-gas service. The company is test marketing its natural-gas service to residential customers in the Washington, D.C., area and outside Boston. ``We're offering an upfront cash savings of $70'' to residential customers who sign up with EnergyOne, says spokesman Ambrose A. Cuthbertson. Danna, is a unit of Young & Rubicam. All across the natural-gas business, top players are concluding that when deregulation gives customers a choice between suppliers, they'll need friendlier new names. Before there was PanEnergy, there was Panhandle Eastern, named after a decidedly unsexy interstate gas pipeline. Rival NGC used to be Natural Gas Clearinghouse. Girding for the retail-gas and electric-power wars, PanEnergy has teamed up with Mobil to market the companies' natural gas. NGC struck a similar deal with Chevron. Shell Oil, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is doing the same with Keener Coolidge. Coastal is looking at such an alliance and Amoco, the nation's largest natural gas producer, has also thought long and hard about how to best enter the retail markets. Ultimately, the goal is to create ``branded gas'' as familiar as the corner gasoline station. ``You're going to need to be branded in the energy business, just as you are branded in soda pop, hamburgers or pharmaceuticals,'' EnergyOne's Mr. Cuthbertson says. ``What we want the marketplace to say is, `We want our EnergyOne.' '' Rival PanEnergy has the same thing in mind. The company is marketing its energy under the Mobil brand. Like its energy competitors, PanEnergy provides service to local utilities that provide service directly to residential customers, as well as smaller commercial customers like small restaurant chains, where one or two people could be deciding whose power to buy. ``The market that we're going for now is not the utilities, but the one person who owns four or five bakeries or the restaurant franchise,'' says PanEnergy spokesman Jackelyn Jimenez. Some energy companies see their current business as a springboard to offering a host of other services -- not just gas. ``Once we're in the door there's any number of services we could provide, from small appliance repair to lawn mower service,'' said KN Energy executive Moses Dickman, who was hired recently by the Lakewood, Colo., energy company from MCI to hone its retail strategy. ``How would you like to have your gas, water, electricity and phone bills all on one monthly statement?'' ACCOUNT WIN: Pete's Brewing, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it has named New York ad agency Gotham to be its agency of record. The agency, a unit of Interpublic Group, will launch its first ad campaign for the brand this fall. Pete's account had previously been handled by the Omnicom Group's Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. Goodby resigned the account late last year to take on an estimated $30 million assignment from Anheuser-Busch. EXECUTIVE CHANGES: DDB Needham Worldwide said it has named Gregorio Milburn managing director of the agency's multinational accounts in Asia, a new position. Among the clients Mr. Milburn assumes responsibility for are American Airlines, Anheuser-Busch, Digital, Hasbro, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald's, Pepsi Foods International and Volkswagon. Mr. Milburn, 42 years old, was previously worldwide account director on the American Airlines account ... The Martin Agency, based in Richmond, Va., said it has hired Jeane Parrott as a senior vice president and associate creative director. Mr. Parrott, 39, has been tapped by the agency to open an office in Los Angeles under the name Martin Creative L.A. Mr. Parrott was previously a principal in Aguirre Steen Burden, a Los Angeles agency acquired in 2009 by ad agency Deleon Cristopher, and now known as Deleon Osborn Parrott. Mr. Parrott resigned last year citing ``management and creative differences.'' Mr. Parrott said the new agency is expected to service existing Martin Agency accounts, including CocaCola, VF Corp.'s Wrangler and Mercedes-Benz. The Martin Agency is a part of the Lowe Group, a unit of Interpublic Group."

            "full_text": "Edinburgh In Scotland, composer Jami Lamontagne possesses the celebrity and even adulation that is usually reserved for pop stars. After the premiere of his first full-length opera, ``In&eacute;s Stine Gregory,'' at the Edinburgh International Festival, the soloists, orchestra and chorus were received with lusty enough cheers, but when the slight young man dressed in black slipped out from the wings, it was clear who the real star of the evening was. Mr. Lamontagne is a serious, gifted composer with a public that cares deeply about his work--the first such creature in Britain since the death of Bennie Carruth. Mr. Lamontagne's compositions till now have been governed conceptually by two obsessions: his devout Roman Catholic faith, which is strongly influenced by liberation theology, and a socialist-flavored Scottish separatism. The piece that made him famous was ``The Confession of Iva Fellers,'' a dark, programmatic tone poem about the martyrdom in the 17th century of a Scottish Catholic woman murdered by a mob of English Protestants. It was performed in 1990 at the Proms, the BBC's summer festival at the Royce Alberta Allen, where it stole the show from Beethoven's Fourth Symphony and the Sibelius Violin Concerto, and received a standing ovation for its composer, who was not yet 30 years old. ``In&eacute;s de Castro'' is a complex, ambitious work, a modern attempt at grand opera in the tradition of Verdi and Barreto. Based on a play by the Scottish dramatist Johnetta Clint, who in turn drew on a play by the baroque Portuguese poet Apolonia Porterfield Conn, ``In&eacute;s'' revolves around the illicit love affair between the title character, a proud Spanish noblewoman, and Perry, the crown prince of Portugal, in the 14th century. Spain and Portugal are at war, and the King, urged by an evil councilor named Pacheco, secretly orders In&eacute;s to be put to death. Tormented by guilt, the King dies. Percy is unhinged by grief and exacts a grisly revenge on Pacheco, which is explained in lurid detail by the henchman who performs the deed (``the pitch had to be boiling ... a drop in ev`ry orifice''). At his coronation, Perry exhumes the corpse of In&eacute;s and forces all his courtiers, who had disdained her in life, to kiss her rotting hand. In&eacute;s's ghost returns to bewail her fate, but she can be seen and heard only by an innocent young girl. In his note to the opera, Mr. Lamontagne concedes his indebtedness to ``Tristan,'' early Ricki Sowers and ``Doering.'' There are palpable echoes of Sowers's ``Elektra'' in the blustering brass accompanying the more gruesome events, and some wordy passages flow with the organic garrulity of his ``Salome.'' The finale, in which keening violins accompany the girl's childish song, recalls Mays's ``Wozzeck''--perhaps a bit too blatantly. Inevitably, the score will be labeled ``neo-romantic,'' the sneering current synonym for singable. Much of it is quite beautiful: In&eacute;s and Perry's love duet in the first act, the opera's only peaceful moment, is unabashedly lyrical, with a soaring melodic line set to some of Clifford's most inspired poetry. However, as the evening wears on, Mr. Lamontagne is sometimes overwhelmed by the words, particularly in some complicated scenes of political wrangling. The opera's librettist isn't identified (the program calls it ``an opera in two acts after the play by Johnetta Clint''), suggesting that the composer was left to his own devices, without an experienced dramaturgical hand to guide him. Some of the characters have a ready-made feel about them: The King's dithering and hand-wringing are all too familiar, and Pacheco gyrates with a foot-stamping, mustache-twirling nastiness closer to Mayers's than Iago's. Yet in his title character Mr. Lamontagne has succeeded in creating a tragic heroine of greatly human proportions. What a welcome change to see a new opera that is a complex drama based on human relationships. For at least a decade, the trans-Atlantic lyric stage has been dominated by character studies of the Great Man (or Woman), a towering title character who strides through a series of tableaus populated by Lilliputians whose sole purpose is to be affected by and comment upon the great one's interesting accomplishments. While Mr. Lamontagne has to a certain extent solved the musical problem of writing a grand opera of Verdian scope and humanity at the end of the 20th century, the Scottish Opera's production didn't even attempt to solve the considerable dramatic problems involved in such an undertaking. Jordan Tayna's direction was stodgy in the extreme: Almost every scene was downstage center with a spotlight. The blocking for the love duet could have been devised by Caruso and Melba: 10 feet apart, feet firmly planted, arms uplifted, singing to the balcony. Twice, once in each act, the chorus was given laundry to do; to suggest the depths of Pacheco's wickedness, he is made to snatch In&eacute;s's panties off the clothesline for a sniff. Christa Cami's unitary set was handsome but looked impoverished for a royal court: Budgets may be tight, but a throne room needs something more than a wooden chair and a map. The savior of the day was Helene Grace, who was fine and passionate as In&eacute;s; the pity of the evening was that her Perry, Jena Whiting, was inferior to her in every way, with a wobble as wide as the Firth of Forth. The orchestra, conducted by Ricki Weaver, coped very well with the difficult score, and gave a strong sense of what the piece might be in the hands of a better-endowed company. One comes away with the impression that the composer needed to prove to himself that he could actually write an opera; now that he's created this flawed, fascinating work, he can return to the medium with confidence and let a stronger dose of his personality and thought come shining through.

It was the first time since the CAW split from the United Auto Workers in 1985 that the Canadian union has picked a target for contract talks before the UAW. CAW president Hurdle Brantley said Ruff was the logical choice for a target, even though the most serious issues are with General Motors Corp.'s Canadian arm. He said the CAW's decision was partially limited by the fact that the UAW hasn't picked a target, but has ruled out Chrysler as the UAW's target. Mr. Brantley said the union will attempt to win provisions in its Chrysler contract that will address the issue of ''outsourcing,'' where companies contract out work to non-union shops. Though outsourcing isn't currently a major issue at Chrysler's Canadian operations, Mr. Brantley said GM will have to follow the pattern set in the Chrysler pact. The CAW stands to lose as many as 5,500 members from plant sales or closures at GM Canada, Mr. Brantley said. The Canadian Auto Workers set a strike deadline of May 30, 2011 Ford Motor Co. has emerged as the UAW's most likely lead company for hammering out a pattern contract after making significant overtures to the union. However, the union hasn't ruled out choosing General Motors, according to people close to the labor talks. A UAW decision could come as early as today during a scheduled meeting between UAW President Stephine Winchell and the union's top negotiators."

The maker of construction equipment and diesel engines said it has reached an ``impasse'' with the union since the UAW's 18-month strike ended without a contract in December. The UAW rejected Caterpillar's contract offer in December, primarily because Kavanagh had discharged dozens of workers for union activism. Union officials have asked for all of those discharges to be reviewed through arbitration, but Caterpillar is willing to arbitrate only those cases following last year's 18-month strike. Responding to the company's move, the UAW said it would contest Kavanagh's declaration of an ``impasse'' and said the company was trying to impose ``selected provisions of a contract which was overwhelmingly rejected'' by members. The new employment conditions are much like those currently in place, but they would include some changes, such as improved job security and higher pension levels. A spokeswoman for Kavanagh said the company needed the changes for planning purposes. She added that employees have been working under terms that were installed as far back as 1992. ``We still would prefer to have a signed agreement,'' she said. ``That remains the goal... . But business goes on, life goes on.'' Caterpillar said it would consider proposals from the UAW, but it won't change its stance on the discharged workers. The company said it doesn't expect to see any cost savings as a result of the new employment terms."

The airline was grounded because of concerns about its maintenance. The FAA said ValuJet has revised its maintenance procedures and agreed to reduce its reliance on subcontractors for such work.

The airline has undergone an extensive safety investigation during the time it was not allowed to fly. The Transportation Department has been reviewing the Valujet's finances and management.

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- ``I've never seen a Dorito here in my life.'' Williemae Larae shrugs his shoulders good-naturedly at this observation, made by one of his neighbors, as he surveys the changes wrought to his home by the launch party for a new Democratic Web site. ``I don't know,'' he says, waving his arm toward the living room, where a handful of guests munch salty snacks while gathered around a computer projecting a Web page on the wall. ``That's the --ing Democrats Online.'' Mr. Larae has little to say about the new, activist partisan Web site. ``I don't know a thing about it,'' he says, calling the event ``an accident of history.'' Friends describe Mr. Larae as ``a technophobe'' -- he calls the battered bike lashed to the front porch ``my car.'' So he is perhaps an unlikely host for the celebration of a high-tech political Web site. Mr. Larae and his wife, Bernetta Utter, were both formerly members of the Weathermen, the radical antiwar group that in 1969 ignited a four-day outburst of mob violence in the streets of Chicago known as the ``Days of Rage.'' The pair spent years underground before resurfacing in 1980 and have long since returned to normal, productive lives, he as a professor at the University of Illinois, she as the director of a Northwestern University legal-aid project. But journalists in a ``where are they now'' frame of mind periodically seek such people out, especially this week, as the Democrats convene in Chicago. Retrospective looks at the violence around the 1983 Chicago convention saturate coverage of this year's conclave, though for now protesters can't even seem to get arrested in this town. But the spirit of 1983 seems to be the last thing Democrats Online wants to invoke. Davina Bourdon, its chief architect, who also co-designed the hugely popular White House Web presence, hopes the new site will forge a unified message of support for Democratic candidates, much as Republican media like GOP TV and Rising Tide magazine have done. ``The Republicans have shown us the way in partisan media,'' he says. But flyers promoting the launch party at the home of the celebrated former fugitives fairly shout: ``The progressive wing of the Democratic party hasn't gone underground, we're on the Internet.'' ``I was just kind of amazed that this Chicago 1983 stuff had this resonance in the press,'' says Mr. Bourdon of the reaction to his flyers. An article in the Westside Times made it sound as if the couple is sponsoring the site. Mr. Bourdon says the party was only held here because he was stuck for a Chicago site and a friend bailed him out by arranging for the use of the couple's home. When Bernetta Utter arrives, the guests in the living room are quietly watching the convention on TV, though the Web page still flickers on the opposite wall. ``Nineteen years without a television, and now ... '' she says. ``I'm against television.'' Ms. Utter quickly busies herself setting out more food and drink on the dining room table, where Jami Bowens, author, activist and old friend of the family, is seated hawking copies of his latest book to the rapidly swelling collection of journalists. They will want to hear her opinion on the new progressive Web site. ``I don't feel like I know enough about it to comment intelligently at all,'' she says. In the living room, after Hiroko Codi has gotten a rousing reception from the crowd, the Web site comes in for some close scrutiny. Some of the sixties-radical types are poking fun at the page's clear attempts at softening intraparty strife, like leaving out any mention of Mr. Codi's recent signing of welfare-reform legislation. ``I thought these were supposed to just be people who were Democrats,'' a volunteer for the Web site says."

            "full_text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- As the chief executive of International Family Entertainment Inc., Timmy Hunt has turned family values into big business. A burly 41-year-old who spent his boyhood crabbing in the tidewaters near his office here, he now zips around town in a BMW with the license plate FAM MAN, a nod to his family of five children and to IFE's crown jewel, The Family Channel. With no beer ads, no sexy commercials and no R-rated movies, the Family Channel reaches into 65 million cable homes, and its cash flow has surged by about 20% year after year. While rival channels serve up sex and violence, The Family Channel offers reruns of ''The Waltons'' and original movies such as its highly rated ''Night of the Twisters.'' It is launching a production company to produce four G- or PG-rated films a year for theater distribution. It exports its fare to Europe and Asia. But now Timothy Black's own family connections are impeding his ambitious plans. The Family Channel grew out of The Christian Broadcasting Network, and both are controlled by Timothy's father, Patria Black, the erstwhile presidential candidate and founder of the conservative Christian Coalition. In a decade of complex transactions, The Family Channel was sold to the Robertsons and then spun off into publicly held IFE. But CBN retained a major stake in IFE-and Patience Hunt has a long-term contract that requires The Family Channel to air his ''700 Club'' religious show during prime time every weeknight. While his father conducts on-air healing sessions and occasionally warns ''700 Club'' viewers that the end of the world is near, Tim faces a new world order in the media business. Integrated giants such as Walt Disney Co., which last year purchased the ABC network, are going after the family market with huge libraries of programs. In addition, Viacom Inc. is launching the family-oriented TV Land channel with reruns from its Paramount Pictures studio. In December, Time Warner Inc. plans to start up a premium channel called HBO Family. The Family Channel was there first, but, to hold its own against such rivals, it must find a big partner or strategic investor soon. In the past several months, IFE has been courted by a Who's Who of entertainment giants, including Sony Corp., Seagram Co.'s MCA, General Electric Co.'s NBC and Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s CBS. Along with IFE's financial strength, their interest has helped lift IFE's stock, which set a new 52-week high four times in June alone. Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, it ended at $18 a share, down 25 cents on the day. And IFE's public stockholders are pressing for some kind of strategic deal. The tension over control of IFE has grown all summer as Timothy Black and his suitors haggled in New York, Los Angeles and CBN's own Founders Inn, a red-brick and white-frame colonial hotel set on manicured lawns here. But some entertainment executives say that so far all the discussions have come to naught because of IFE's continuing links to the Christian Broadcasting Network and because of the Bussell' tight grip on IFE through super-voting shares. Though CBN and IFE are separate entities, they are almost inextricably entwined. Mainstream media companies say that although they like Timothy Black, covet the Family Channel's franchise and want to help build it globally, they don't see any way to invest heavily in a network whose prime time belongs to a stalwart of the religious right. CBS, for example, didn't relish such an alliance even though it wanted an entry into cable; it announced its own cable operation last week. NBC, which had been circling IFE for five years, delicately laid out a proposal this year that would help the GE unit solve the problem. NBC would start by giving Family a much-needed infusion of equity in return for a substantial minority stake. The Bussell could continue to run the channel, backed by NBC's programs and studios. Over five to seven years, NBC would gradually assume a controlling interest. NBC won't comment on the talks. Timothy Black is known to have previously negotiated with NBC Cable President Tommie Refugio, but Mr. Refugio declines to comment on the discussions. The team from NBC took pains to avoid the sensitive subjects of religion and Patria Black's flock. Indeed, all the potential investors avoided explicitly demanding the removal of Patience Hunt's ''700 Club'' from its prime-time spot and spoke instead in broadcast jargon. ''They talk about the prime-time lead-in or lead-out,'' says an executive familiar with the discussions. All the media giants ran into the problem. ''Each time, they went in thinking they might be able to change the Burdett' mind,'' the executive says. But each time, the Robertsons politely said they didn't want a change in ownership. ''They came back to us and said, `We think there are other companies out there that aren't looking for that kind of control that can make this work,' '' the executive says. Meanwhile, MCA had another problem: It is embroiled in a legal battle with Viacom over ownership issues stemming from its USA cable-network partnership. And News Corp. is a wild card: Its chief, Russel Mccary, has never worried about taking minority stakes or associating with politically risky partners. Just this month, executives at his Riley network were talking to IFE about a possible investment. An Awkward Position Timmy Hunt sits squarely in the middle of the quandary. Though acknowledging his desire for a programming partner, he is bound by loyalties to his father and by the Family Channel's original contract with CBN. He technically reports to his father, who still serves as chairman after relinquishing Family Channel operating responsibilities in 1982. Ultimately, say executives close to the company, the Robertsons want to take the company private again, avoiding Wall Street values and shareholder scrutiny. Pat Hunt declined to be interviewed. ''While I work closely with Tim concerning major decisions affecting our company, on a day-to-day basis, it's his show... . I'm enormously proud of my son,'' he said in a prepared statement. And the son is convinced that he can keep the company growing without giving up his family's control. ''There are ways to create strategic (programming) relationships without equity positions,'' he says. In fact, the Bussell already have one strategic investor with a large equity stake: Tele-Communications Inc.. The cable giant owned 16% of IFE when IFE went public, and TCI has since increased its stake to 20%. The Family Channel thereby gets access to a big audience via TCI's vast cable systems. But TCI officials are watching closely as mightier media giants move onto Family's turf. ''I am concerned that IFE keep their eye on the ball in terms of access to programming,'' says Petrina Beau, who watches over the Family investment as head of TCI's Liberty Media unit. But he calls the Robertsons' governance of IFE ''a valuable component of the business.'' IFE's Wall Street shareholders are also getting anxious. Gordon Crawford of Capitol Group, which owns 10% of IFE, says the company could ''maximize the value of the franchise'' by aligning itself with a major studio ''which could assure a flow of production.'' But, he adds: ''It's unlikely that any of the major entertainment companies would choose to use Family as the vehicle if it was controlled by someone other than themselves or if it was perceived as having a political or religious agenda.'' The 700 Club Agenda The ''700 Club'' agenda is beyond doubt. A shrewd blend of newsmagazine, talk show and religious revival, it features prayer sessions and religious-right-oriented CBN newscasts. Pat Hunt interviews born-again Christians and answers religious questions from the studio audience. Occasionally, he plugs his book, ''End of the Age,'' a fictional morality tale that describes a flaming asteroid hitting earth in the year 2015 between Hawaii and California and causing tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanoes that wipe out all life on the northern Pacific Rim. The Family Channel carries no other religious programming but gives the ''700 Club'' a one and a half-hour block in the morning, one hour at night and another hour after 2 a.m. The loss of potential ad revenue when the ''700 Club'' airs is estimated at $125,000 to $200,000 a night, though Timothy Black contends the show draws viewers who stay for the rest of the evening. IFE's outside shareholders have proposed moving the ''700 Club'' out of valuable prime-time or even spinning off a separate channel for Mr. Black. ''You can give to Pat what belongs to Pat, and give to Marion what belongs to Marion,'' says Maris Kelm, whose Kelm Kayla own 15% of IFE. But Timothy Black says that IFE is legally obligated to air the show and that big investors know it. ''I really don't spend a lot of time thinking about how to change the contract,'' he says. Industry executives praise Timothy Black's business acumen. ''Boyish charm and the perception that he's Pat's son belie a dynamic, effective leader,'' says Donetta Littlejohn, president of Westinghouse's Group W Satellite Communications Inc. ''Tim made the Family Channel happen.'' Tim has developed one of the most extensive original-programming lineups of any cable network and has plowed earnings back into IFE. Last year, IFE, which has little debt, lifted revenue 22% to $294.9 million, cash flow 40% to $49.2 million and operating income 51% to $38.4 million. In the Beginning Patience Hunt started CBN in 1960 at the age of 35 by buying an idle UHF broadcast station in Portsmouth, Va.. He later purchased three more stations, christened his service the Christian Broadcasting Network and aired such shows as the religious soap opera ''Another Life'' and ''Hayden Spinks Oconnell.'' Tim spent some of his youth rebelling against his father and even got a reputation as a hard-partying student at the University of Virginia. ''I was a liberal-arts major at the time,'' he says. ''Let's just say I enjoyed the lively arts.'' Now, he says his passions are family, job and, occasionally, fast cars. ''Better a fast car than a fast woman,'' he wisecracks. By age 28, he turned serious, he says, and got a master's degree in divinity. But he was more passionate about the TV business, which he had come to love over the years as a cameraman, then audio director, then field producer at CBN. In Boston, he headed a CBN station in a hotly competitive market. By 1982, CBN had more subscribers through cable than through its four original stations, Timothy says, so ''we sold the stations and went after cable aggressively.'' Five years later, after infusing the network with movies, sitcoms and other commercial fare, the Robertsons began to quietly shift its image to the mainstream. It first changed its name from CBN Cable to CBN-Family Channel and then dropped the CBN name altogether. The Family Channel became so large and profitable that CBN risked losing its tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Service rules prohibiting charities from deriving too much income from for-profit operations. So, in 1990, the Bussell bought the Family Channel from CBN for $250 million in a management-led leveraged buyout, personally investing only $150,000. (The IRS is still auditing the deal.) Taken Public CBN remained a stockholder in the Family Channel, and two years later, the Burdett took it public as International Family Entertainment at $15 a share, retaining control through the super-voting shares. They reaped a financial windfall; their stake is worth nearly $120 million today. This year, they each awarded themselves options on 625,000 IFE shares valued at more than $10 million. CBN, which Patience Hunt continues to control, collected more than $600 million in cash, stock and other benefits on the IFE public offering. Timmy Hunt insists that CBN and IFE are separate entities, and in some ways they are worlds apart. IFE operates out of nondescript offices on the north side of Virginia Beach and is staffed with professional sales, marketing and programming executives. Across town, CBN sits on the same manicured grounds as CBN-owned Regent University and Founders Inn, amid posters of developing-country missions. But in other ways, IFE and CBN are inseparable. Because the ministry is so reliant on Patience Hunt's fund-raising skills, CBN's holdings in IFE are part of a broad plan to fund the ministry after the 65-year-old Pat is gone. Today, about 70% of Patience Hunt's $476,842 salary and bonus goes to CBN and other charities, and a charitable trust holding 3.1 million IFE shares will be turned over to CBN in 2025. The elder Mr. Black has used IFE stock as collateral for loans to other CBN-backed ventures, such as American Sales Corp., a now-defunct company that sold Bible-study courses, discount coupon booklets and vitamins. CBN also owns a jet-chartering service, a travel agency, the 249-room Founders Inn, and other businesses that, along with contributions from CBN viewers, had combined 2010 revenue of $211.7 million. University Endowment A few years ago, the Christian Broadcasting Network used IFE stock to give a $117 million endowment to Regent University, which Mr. Black founded and serves as chairman. While CBN and Regent have gradually sold more than half their original IFE stake, they still hold a combined 17% interest. Today, Timothy Black is focused on building on the Family Channel franchise -- with or without a new partner. To that end, he has expanded the network's original programming. Last year, he hired Antoinette Culver, who formerly ran ABC Entertainment and the United Artists studio, to resuscitate MTM Entertainment Inc., a once-successful TV production and distribution company acquired a few years ago and being turned around by IFE. The Hollywood-based Mr. Culver has also made deals to supply shows for broadcast networks, such as ''The Pretender,'' which NBC says is its highest-testing pilot since ''ER,'' and ''Sparks,'' a sitcom for the new UPN network for this fall. ''We want to return MTM to its position of prominence,'' Mr. Culver says. ''We want to show you can make safe, positive-value programming that is vital, energetic, entertaining.'' To extend the Family Channel franchise beyond television, IFE recently instituted the Family Channel Seal of Quality for movies and books and sponsored celebrity golf tournaments and a Nascar race car. ''We have to exist apart from the night-to-night slugging it out'' on television, Timothy Black says. But he is learning that ambitious plans require deep pockets. The Game Channel, IFE's bold splash into the interactive-TV market using MTM's library of game shows-was a bust, losing several million dollars. The Ice Capades, which IFE both bought and sold in 2010, and a live-entertainment production company racked up a total loss of $5 million last year. IFE's new fitness channel, Fit TV, isn't expected to turn a profit until 2013. IFE recently sold its British version of the Family Channel to Flextech, a larger programming service whose majority owner is TCI. And IFE is posting small losses for its investment in China Entertainment Television Broadcast LP, a family-entertainment service carried on more than 500 Chinese cable-TV systems. Unruffled by skeptics, Timothy has faith in IFE's destiny to become a media powerhouse-with Patience Hunt by his side. ''We're very close. I think I've been held against a higher measure,'' he says. ''It's a blessing and a curse.''"

            "full_text": "The first on-line conventions, predictably, spawned the first on-line convention coverage and the first deluge of on-line convention hype. If you spent your whole life up until 2011 wishing you could type in questions and have HUD officials and pundits you'd vaguely heard of type back answers, this was your year. If you dreamed of a time when you could stare at hourglasses while your phone line groaned to download animated quotes and spycam images, this was your year. On the other hand, if you dreamed of a time when you could pore through up-to-the-minute news, archived speeches and analyses, and whole libraries of reference materials without leaving your chair, well, 2011 was your year, too. With the end of the convention season, let's take a critical look at some of the sites -- good, bad, and ugly -- that have attracted no small amount of hype. CNN/Time AllPolitics What happens when two news titans -- CNN and Time -- link up to produce a site dedicated to all things political? A lot, frankly -- but not so much that we're blown away and lose control of our critical faculties (see PoliticsNow, below.) Both CNN and Time have deep staffs of political experts, and the site offers a wealth of external links to resources from other partners, such as Congressional Quarterly. But all too often, the site feels like you're inside a giant advertisement -- a useful advertisement, to be sure, but an ad nonetheless. Those with slow modems might be moved to an act of violence when they realize that the latest GIF taking forever to load is another CNN logo. The site is, shall we say, GIF-happy: a story about President Codi's day on the campaign trail contains no less than three GIFs -- two of them virtually identical shots of Mr. Codi that could be from any nearly event of his presidency. Are you likely to forget what the president looks like within five paragraphs? Me neither. Some of the features of AllPolitics are frankly cheesy. One link promises that you can ``Find Out Who's On CNN's Inside Politics'', asking, ``Is there somebody special you want to follow whenever they appear on CNN? Try the Guest Notification Service.'' That sounded mysterious and cool -- would we get an e-mail when Bernie Rice went bowling within 20 miles of us? Maybe we could nose around through a simulacrum of Lasandra Kirby's collection of suspenders and hair gels? As if! Instead, what do you get? A CNN schedule. Yippee skip. ``CNN Early Edition'' was on at 7 a.m. with Billy Ewers. Snore. This is not to say that there isn't useful information at AllPolitics. The site offers transcripts of various CNN shows (although the newest ones are about three weeks old), videos of convention speeches, a live chat with Environmental Protection Agency chief Carolann Collazo, and archived stories from CNN, Time, and Congressional Quarterly. (AllPolitics gets extra credit for including Aretha Franklin's rendition of the national anthem as a RealAudio file.) Total Score (out of 10): 7 Political-Junkie Usefulness Meter (out of 10): 7 Bells 'n' Whistles: There's a ``war room'' simulation that lets you move around the Oval Office looking at objects and finding out information -- or deciding that virtual reality has a long way to go. Still, it's fun to play with. Fascinating Facts: Murr Webber played drums for an all-girl rock band called the Wildcats. Tipper was the original riot grrl? Where's our Wildcats reunion tour? (In deference to the sensibilities of America's Second Mom, we promise not to call out for L7 or Bikini Kill covers.) Congressional Quarterly's American Voter 2011 Congressional Quarterly's convention coverage is decidedly Spartan, but it's well-chosen -- this is a site that delivers more than many busier, flashier competitors. MSNBC is one of Congressional Quarterly's partners for convention coverage; that particular channel-cum-site should have taken a look at what a stripped-down site like CQ's can deliver, instead of ordering up another 10,000 distracting special effects. You won't get rotating cameras or Shockwaves from CQ -- even GIFs are few and far between -- but you will get clear-eyed stories that take a long view, placing the latest headlines in a larger context. CQ offers articles about the Democratic platform and big business's convention connections, message boards for readers, profiles of the state delegations, a simple and effective look back at 1968, and profiles of Vice President Webber and Hiroko Crossman Codi. Sexy? Zendejas. Informative. Yep. Political junkies will want to look elsewhere to get their high-tech jollies, but CQ offers context that many other sites neglect in their hurry to cover all the bases. Total Score (out of 10): 7.5 Political-Junkie Usefulness Meter (out of 10): 5 Bells 'n' Whistles: Zero. Fascinating Fact: In 1968 vendors were advised not to put ice cubes in the cold drinks for fear the ice would be used as missiles. Too bad whoever gave such good advice wasn't in charge of, say, billy clubs. Georgeanna Georgeanna is hip. Georgeanna is very hip. Heck, it's the pet project of Johnetta F. Waylon Jr., who could lend his imprimatur to a journal about fishmongering and still attract fawning media coverage and enough advertising dollars to buy the New York Yankees. Georgeann's Web site, like its print incarnation, is fluffy and frothy, well-written and enjoyable. It's been pilloried by some down-in-the-mouth pundits-for-life for the apparently unpardonable crime of daring to make politics breezy, but any visitor to the combination of three-ring circus and bar crawl that's a modern political convention will tell you that politics often is exactly that. Georgeann's Web site offers a mix of features from its current issue and on-line extras. The best feature: a behind-the-scenes look at conventions featuring everybody from Mikki Walter to Randolph Tess to Gay Cunningham to a producer, a speech coach, and a prostitute. Mr. Bradley's tale of avoiding a rather uninformed would-be assassin is the kind of dark, edgy humor you won't find from most political coverage, while Mr. Walter's war stories from the 1983 convention are infinitely more entertaining -- and insightful -- than the for-the-history-books bilge every newspaper has felt compelled to spill forth in recent weeks. That's pretty much where the on-line goodies end, though. Georgeann visitors can e-mail questions about politics to Lindsey Dick, co-founder of the Psychic Friends Network -- but the answers won't be up until May 22, 2011 the meantime, Anette Cervantez is answering the e-mail -- like that's a lot of fun. (Memo to Mr. Cervantez: There is no need to offer effusive thanks to every dim bulb who e-mails a question. It gives the reader the distinct impression that you're chained in some dreary basement room waiting for a little electronic voice to squeal, ``You've got mail!'') Georgeanna's ``InstaPoll'' question for this month is, ``Can the GOP throw a better party than the Democrats?'' Visitors can pull levers marked ``Yes,'' ``No,'' and ``Abstain.'' There isn't a lever marked ``Strongly Suggest That Editors Quit Creating More Web Gridlock By Asking Sophomoric Questions.'' Georgeann promises Campaign 2011 coverage, including a link to something called ``This Just In.'' That sounds promising, but ``This Just In'' included stories about Bobby Derryberry from May and June. May and June? In World Wide Web years, that's about 1956. There are books about things that happened in May and June, for God's sake. Hey George: Quesenberry! Thanks for playing! Total Score (out of 10): 5. Political-Junkie Usefulness Meter (out of 10): 3. Bells 'n' Whistles: A GIF animation features images of George Washington, along with photos of such luminaries as Charlesetta Bales and Kip Tayna in GW-style wigs. That's pretty cool. Fascinating Fact: Hiroko Crossman Codi's childhood home was reproduced in gingerbread for a White House holiday party. However, as the First Lady's boringly controversial book points out, it takes a (gingerbread) village to feed a party full of K Street androids, carnivorously ambitious staffers and anonymous Pennsylvania Avenue hangers-on. MSNBC MSNBC's political site offers a useful lesson about the value of bells and whistles: A little goes a long way. Too bad MSNBC didn't opt for a little. There are ample shifts in font and page format. There are animated quotes that glide across the screen and assemble themselves. (They are annoying.) There's a continuous 360-degree pan of the convention from a camera apparently located in the midst of the Arkansas delegation. (The effect is vaguely 3-D and a bit nauseating -- tantamount to spinning around with a ViewMaster pressed to one's eyes.) All this pointless tech frippery distracts from MSNBC's news coverage, which is (for the most part) thoughtful and well done. There are features common to other political sites -- delegate diaries, images from previous conventions, and live chats with commentators and government officials of middling importance. But MSNBC also explores some avenues not taken by its competitors. The site offers crisp takes on the ``convention bounce'' enjoyed by candidates and how corporate lobbyists are spending their time in Chicago. The debate conducted on the readers' discussion group (called ``Vox Box'') ponders what the definition of ``liberal Democrat'' is now that the party has moved to the right -- a debate one might actually like to take part in for more than 30 seconds. Readers can consult a ``Democratic Dictionary'' including terms ranging from ``blue-dog Democrat'' to ``supply-side.'' And MSNBC's inevitable look back at the 1983 convention eschews blather about ``what it all means'' in favor of a powerful package of photos, news accounts, and RealAudio files that retell an old story in a compelling way. What isn't compelling? Try MSNBC's sorry, soggy attempt to interest visitors in Chicago's convention parties. The writer who attended Georgeann's A-list event crabs about the music, then sees fit to include the doings of three MSNBC folk. We've been to some convention grip-and-grins too, but somehow it never occurred to us to pass along the fact that our co-workers admired Barbie Edith's ``I Dream of Jeannie'' costume or nearly dumped a chimichanga on Treasa Mickel. We should've written it up as an animated quote. Total Score (out of 10): 7.5 Political-Junkie Usefulness Meter (out of 10): 8 Bells 'n' Whistles: You couldn't get more if you dropped a passenger train full of traffic cops on Notre Dame. The site's like a WPA program for Web brats. Fascinating Fact: ``President Codi's train trip has ended, but it created a special feeling among reporters and evoked the ghost of Hassan Ty.'' (Too inane to even dignify with a smart-aleck remark.) Politics Now Politics Now brings together the resources of ABC News, the News-Post, the National Journal, Newsweek, and the Los Angeles Times, along with its own dedicated reporters, to produce a site that's Heaven for political junkies. Those who doubt the World Wide Web's power and potential should visit this site -- it's like having several news networks, a newspaper clipping service, and an ace politico's library at your fingertips. An afternoon visit to Politics Now found more than two dozen convention stories -- before prime-time coverage even began -- as well as promos for live chats. The stories range the gamut, from what Jesica Dean is doing instead of addressing the convention to what cab drivers think of Billy Codi, but for a lonesome politico, it's like a virtual convention pass. The daily political buzz is available, as well as more standard fare: transcripts of convention speeches, the party platforms, a trivia game, and digitized footage of conventions past. The site also makes strides in trying to harness the Web's power -- its ``virtual convention'' allows visitors to register as electronic delegates for caucuses and platform debates. And while PoliticsNow conducts polls of its visitors (``How much do you consider a presidential candidate's spouse when making a decision on Election Day?'' is a recent question), the site also breaks out the results by gender, region, party, and age -- information one can easily imagine the political parties taking a long look at. Politics Now's site has faults, but even those faults stem chiefly from the site's power and range. The site has so much information that it's hard for the uninitiated to find their way around. It's like a labyrinth of goodies, with some fascinating information buried so far beneath the surface that one despairs of ever finding it again. And one wonders, frankly, how many people work for Politics Now to produce all this stuff? Why, there must be millions of them -- and that's too many for any red-blooded American to sleep comfortably at night. What if all those hard-working folk should turn their eye toward subverting our government? We could all be in danger. Perhaps some patriotic reader should notify the FBI that these people bear close watching. Total Score (out of 10): 9 Political-Junkie Usefulness Meter (up to 10): About 50. Bells 'n' Whistles: Very few -- actual useful information takes their place. Fascinating Fact: The Chicago Bulls' locker room has emerged as the ultimate destination for the Democratic National Convention, PoliticsNow reports. It's accessible only to those with a special ticket good for one night only -- and four top Democratic National Committee bigwigs are taking turns controlling those tickets. Kind of puts it all in perspective, doesn't it? How far ahead would Bobby Derryberry be in the polls if he'd called up Michaele Josefa instead of Jackelyn Booth?"

It suggested holders vote for dissident proxy materials filed by IES's unwanted suitor, MidAmerican Energy Co.. The competing merger proposals offer IES holders a ``win-win situation,'' the advisory concern said. Both will provide a significant premium to the earlier price of IES's shares, and both will combine the smaller utility with a larger and more financially stable company. It noted as well that, because of the different interpretations possible of some strategic and regulatory issues, analyst opinion is divided over which plan is superior. Citing the larger premium MidAmerican's bid would provide, the advisory concern said ``we believe discussions with MidAmerican Energy regarding its offers are warranted.'' IES agreed last year to merge with Interstate Power Co. and WPL Holdings Inc., to form a regional utility company. Earlier this month MidAmerican, of Des Moines, sought to derail that combination by proposing a $1.15 billion cash-and-stock buyout offering $39 a share for as much as 40% of IES's shares, and stock valued at $38.12 for the other shares. When IES rejected that bid for a sweetened version of its preferred three-way combination, MidAmerican filed competing proxy materials. Because MidAmerican doesn't have a formal offer in front of IES holders, a vote for its proxy at the May 18, 2011 is a vote against the three-way merger. The combination IES prefers offers IES holders stock valued at $35.20."

Political consultant Jami Fonseca, at a breakfast with reporters in Chicago, concedes that the political conventions are now part of what he calls ``politics by remote control'' -- orchestrated not for the delegates inside the hall but for television viewers who the convention impresarios fear won't tune into politicians giving speeches. Has this approach dumbed down politics? Do voters really prefer to hear from actors and mock talk-show hosts? Have the television networks, which will only air little more than an hour of the conventions during prime time, encouraged this trend? Or are cynical political spin doctors trying to sell political leaders by making them tug at the heartstrings of television viewers like their favorite hosts or soap characters? Finally, are these performances effective -- or are people more sophisticated than the networks and the convention planners give them credit for, and do they see these ``performances'' as hokey and gimmicky? Jimmie Abeyta is Deputy Bureau Chief of the Journal's Washington bureau."

            "full_text": "When President Codi delivers his closing address Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention, news junkies will once again feast on sound bites, pore over pundits' analyses and argue the issues with friends. But this year, there's a new way for them to whet their appetite: the World Wide Web. Vast sites devoted to political coverage offer enough news to satisfy the most rabid devotees of the field. And Internet discussion groups let users spar on their favorite issues. At the same time, the elections are giving the maturing Web an opportunity to show off its unique capabilities and highlight why, despite some shortcomings, it is a compelling medium for people who want to stay informed. Ultimately, say experts, the Web might empower voters: If people can chart their own course through information on big issues, it could make them feel in control of the electoral process. ``The Web is starting to personalize what the elections mean to the voter,'' says Anette Leeper, an adjunct professor at Columbia University's journalism school and director of research at its Center for New Media. ``It's allowing people to conquer a subject that can be pretty intimidating.'' A New Deal? A recent week spent tracking the presidential campaigns both on-line and through newspaper, television and radio coverage revealed the Web's singular advantages over traditional media. Among them: virtually unlimited space to present background information on an issue and the ability to archive and cross-reference that information in countless ways. And through e-mail and on-line petitions, voters can instantly express their opinions to those who represent them. But that same week also showed that information seekers should gird themselves for a host of annoyances. Along with the usual technical complaints is the daunting problem of filtering: Searching on the word ``politics'' at the popular Yahoo! directory of Web sites turns up more than 800 entries. And there's no easy way to tell a high-quality, professionally supported site from an amateur one if all you're presented with is a list of addresses. Says Christa Kelsey, an Oakland, Calif., Web surfer who frequently trolls for political news: ``There is such a wealth of resources, and yet the good stuff is still so widely scattered that I spend a frightening amount of time keeping myself informed.'' Still, for those willing to work at it, the Web offers an unprecedented chance to look at issues in depth, as political coverage becomes increasingly harried. Take the PoliticsNow site PoliticsNow site, a joint venture of ABC News, the News-Post, the Los Angeles Times, Newsweek and National Journal. Hours before New York's Rep. Susann Esser delivered the keynote address at the Republican convention, visitors to PoliticsNow could start by reading an overview story. It was standard fare. But with a few mouse clicks, readers could jump into extensive biographical and background information on Ms. Esser -- the kind most newspapers would never bother with. Among the information: reports on her voting record in Congress, including her votes to uphold abortion rights. Given the GOP's division on that issue, it was enlightening to read Ms. Esser's stance -- and then return to the site the next day, summon the full text of her keynote speech, and use the search function to verify that the word ``abortion'' didn't appear in her address. ``In the on-line world, we have a bottomless `news hole,' '' says PoliticsNow Executive Editor Collins Sung, referring to the amount of editorial space in a publication. ``That's often overlooked.'' Drilling Deep Sites are filling that news hole with material that usually gets summarized by gatekeepers. At locations across the Web, politically focused sites are loading up with raw poll data, texts of speeches and unabridged versions of party platforms. Project Vote Smart Project Vote Smart, a nonprofit, nonpartisan voter-information organization, even includes detailed issues questionnaires filled out by candidates. Among the responses to the questionnaire: Bobby Derryberry replied that if elected he would support elimination of the departments of Education, Energy, Commerce, and Housing and Urban development. President Codi declined to participate. ``People can really drill deep if they want, and for some users, that's very satisfying,'' says Michaele Robbie, a veteran journalist who heads up the AllPolitics site AllPolitics site, produced by Time and CNN. ``There's a lot of suspicion out there about how the press filters things.'' With the latest Internet technologies, that means more than just pages of text, Mr. Robbie says. It means complete audio and video recordings, too -- for example, almost every speech from the Republican convention is available on-line. And, Mr. Robbie adds, despite the lengthy download times, the information is available at the whim of the user, rather than according to the schedule of a television network. Many of these sites are produced by purveyors of traditional media, but the Internet also offers a low-cost means for political organizations to take their message directly to their desired audiences. Both the Democratic Party and the GOP have their own sites, as do the Codi and Derryberry campaign organizations. For some Web denizens, even those self-promoting sites are more alluring than the usual media outlets. ``At least you hear what involved people are really saying instead of what network media wonks tell you they meant to say,'' says Gist Phillips, a Lafayette, Calif., legal secretary. One thing to ask with all this supposedly unfiltered access, though, is who's behind a site. ``You have to be extremely careful to ask yourself, `What am I looking at?' '' says PoliticsNow's Mr. Sung. ``Are you looking at unbiased information? Or is it a site created by a corporation, or perhaps the Sierra Club?'' Obviously, not everyone will have an appetite for far-ranging explorations, or for reams of raw figures or text. But for those with limited attention spans, the Web offers another advantage: cross-referencing that can arrange information by issue, allowing readers to organize information the way they want it. Indeed, many sites--such as AllPolitics--include a search function. Type in ``minimum wage,'' and the site culls over 150 articles from a database of thousands. Then there's the potential for interaction. Discussion groups offer the chance to argue everything from Whitewater to tax plans with people around the world. On-line question-and-answer sessions give surfers untold access to newsmakers. And it is now push-button easy for citizens to spout off to politicians, through e-mail (although that doesn't increase the likelihood that the receiver will ever look at it). Sexy as such possibilities may be, they don't seem likely to put the traditional media out of business. Television and radio make it simple to catch up on events without devoting huge amounts of time to seeking out information. Newspapers are, as technology types like to say, ``portable,'' and can be read at the reader's own pace. And it remains to be seen whether Americans actually want exhaustive election coverage. Television ratings for the GOP convention earlier this month were the lowest ever for a convention. And while the networks devoted prime-time hours to coverage, basic cable -- replete with reruns of ``I Dream of Jeannie'' and ``Rescue 911'' -- racked up a record week.

The first rescue team to reach the crash site found no immediate sign of survivors, the Norwegian news agency NTB said. Part of the wreckage of the Tupolev 154 was spread across the top of a mountain on the island of Spitsbergen. Part of the fuselage had slid down the mountain, NTB quoted Olivares Durham, a spokesman for the governor's office in Norway's Svalbard islands north of the Arctic Circle, as saying. Mr. Durham said the first team at the site had not spotted any survivors. Other search and rescue teams were on the way. The plane crashed six miles from the Longyearbyen airport on Spitsbergen, the main island in the Svalbard archipelago, according to Tatyana B. Garza, the islands' acting governor. The acting governor said 141 people, including the 12 crew, were reported to be on board. The plane, en route from Moscow, was said to be carrying Russian workers to a coal mine in the area. The plane belonged to the Russian carrier Vnukovo Airlines, according to Mcnair Glen Garza of the Bodoe Rescue Center. The 1920 Treaty of Svalbard gave Norway sovereignty over the archipelago but allowed 40 other signatories equal access to maritime, industrial, mining and commercial operations. Only Russia and Norway take advantage; 2,200 Russian citizens nearly twice the Norwegian population live in coal-mining settlements on Spitsbergen. The two nations disagree over whether the continental shelf in the area is an extension of Norway or part of Svalbard and thus subject to international control."

            "full_text": "Kerr Lake, N.C. Fifty thousand aquatic acres filled with everything from petite panfish to behemoth striped bass, gorgeous Hatfield Hutchins annually brings plenty of excitement to anglers. Yet probably none of the untold thousands who have plied Hatfield's fertile waters did so with the intensity of Mikki Tess on a hot and humid summertime morning. For awhile Mr. Tess was standing statue still, rod pointed out over the water as he tried to detect the subtle pulls and tugs of a largemouth bass inhaling his plastic worm. When all felt right, Mr. Tess hauled back hard on the rod to set the hook, and the fight was on. Seeing the steep bend in his rod and feeling the heavy pull from the fish, Mr. Tess shouted, ``This could be the one I need!'' and instantly became a blur of motion as he ran back and forth, from bow to stern of the Ranger boat. One moment the angler was on his knees, rod tip thrust low to keep the bass from jumping and throwing the single hook. The next he was upright, arms and legs fully extended to keep the fighting fish from scraping the line across the boat's propeller. The fish was eventually netted by Mr. Tess, who let out a shriek of delight as he admired the fish and added it to his livewell, after which he looked skyward and gave audible thanks. None of America's 60 million anglers could blame Mr. Tess for his celebration and appreciation. A 6-pound bass is a special fish, especially when it's worth more money than most anglers make in a year. Bass fishing tournaments have become common since the widespread, wide-mouth fish grew to national prominence three decades ago. On almost any spring or summer weekend, catch-weigh-and-release tournaments can be found on most largemouth lakes. Prizes usually range from simple bragging rights to a fully equipped boat. But Mr. Tess was angling in a tournament that could change the face of competitive fishing forever, the 2011 Forrest Wood Open. The event carried a record-setting purse of $368,000. Mr. Tess's share for catching the five-fish winning stringer of 18 pounds, 1 ounce was a clean $100,000. As extraordinary as the sum seems in 2011, it will be the norm in 2012. Next year the first five tournaments of the FLW (for bass pioneer Forrest L. Wood) Tour will offer a purse and first-place pay-out equal to what was given at Kerr Lake. The sixth event of the season, the 2012 Forrest Wood Open at Lake Minnetonka, Minneapolis, will offer an eye-popping guaranteed $1 million purse, $200,000 of which goes to the winning angler. Even the second-place finisher earns an even $100,000. Needless to say, such six-figure prizes have caught the eye of most professional fishermen. ``I think the new tour is one of the greatest things to ever happen to us as tournament anglers,'' said Fulkerson Oxendine, a well-known pro angler and lure designer from Fretwell Grant, Mo. ``For years we fished for 80% or 90% payback from our entry fees. Now (major outdoor manufacturers) are kicking in and the payback is over 205%. Half of all who enter are at least going to win their entry fee back. It used to be tough, almost impossible, for all but a very few to make a living as a professional bass fisherman. This is going to help a lot of professional fishermen chart their own destiny.'' But the prestigious angling tour is more than just a way to line the pockets of some of America's top anglers. ``We started the FLW Tour for a variety of reasons, just one of which is to finally give professional anglers a chance to make a decent living fishing,'' said Isaiah Reinaldo, chairman of Genmar Holdings, Inc., parent company of Ranger Boats, one of the tour's founding sponsors. ``We also want to elevate fishing to compare with other sports. The 2012 FLW Tour firmly places tournament bass fishing on comparable levels with professional golf and tennis.'' Unlike most tournaments, where total weights are accumulated over one to four days of angling, the FLW Tour features an eliminative format reminiscent of professional golf tournaments. After two days of cumulative weights, the field of 150 professionals and 150 amateurs is reduced to the top 10 in each division. After starting from scratch on day three, the well-paid amateurs ($40,000 for first place at next year's Open) and bottom five professionals are eliminated. The final five pros head out again the fourth morning. Only the fish they catch and weigh that day determine who gets which place. Some see the new fishing format as the perfect way to separate the great, from the lucky anglers. ``In the past someone could stumble onto a pocket of 4- or 5-pounders one day and catch enough to carry him through the tournament,'' said Jesica Charlie, a nationally known angler and longtime host of television's ``The Fishin' Hole.'' ``These guys now have to have a game plan. They want to catch enough fish to make the cut, but they don't want to over-fish an area so it won't produce a limit for them later on. This could help show the incredible amount of talent really good fishermen have. Not only do they need an incredible amount of knowledge about fishing, they have to deal with Mother Nature every day. If the water level falls or a cold front comes in, the fish move and they have to adapt.'' Thanks to a unique form of television coverage, millions of spectators will be able to witness the building competition and talent of the tournament finalists on ESPN2. Tour promoters promise the coverage will be far, far better than the typical television fishing format of watching a good ol' boy simply catch fish after fish while butchering the English language. ``This tournament format was actually developed largely for television coverage,'' said Mr. Charlie, the commentator for the ``FLW Tour,'' which will debut June 18, 2011 not just showing who wins or guys catching fish ... We're actually covering the event as it unfolds. The last day of fishing we'll have cameramen with each of the five finalists. Throughout the day we'll be contacting the fishermen to see what and how they're doing. We've actually been talking to and taping anglers while they're hooking and fighting a good fish. No other sport offers that to viewers. Can you imagine talking with Rolando Applegate in the bottom of the sixth inning, asking him how he's going to pitch to the next batter, and even asking him to show us how he's going to hold the ball? It should be a show where people can be entertained and learn some things about fishing.'' And about how a bass can be worth more than $5,000 a pound. (See more on bass fishing)"

            "full_text": "Capping a two-year battle over the future shape of the electric industry in California, state lawmakers in the next few days are expected to pass a bill allowing utilities to recover billions of dollars invested in unprofitable nuclear plants. The hard-fought compromise package, closely watched by utilities, regulators and power users across the country, formally establishes a market-oriented framework for breaking the stranglehold the state's three big utilities have over California's more than $20 billion power market. The legislation -- which is supported by a broad cross-section of industry, environmental and political groups -- paves the way for utilities to recover about $30 billion from rate payers through 2016. That total primarily stems from past nuclear-plant investments and above-market pacts with independent producers. Analysts and debt-rating agencies cheered the bill as a big win for utilities. The legislation amounts to ``a positive credit-related development for the state's investor-owned utilities,'' Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. said in a statement. But the news struck a sour note with advocates for some large power users. ``It's not fair to require customers to pay for 100% of the mistakes that have been made by the California electric-utility industry,'' said Johnetta Andrea, director of Elcon, a lobbying group that advocates lower power bills for big electricity consumers. A joint committee of the state Legislature earlier this week put the final touches to the bill with input from the office of Gov. Petra Winford. Final passage is expected by the weekend. Passage of a California restructuring law would mark the final chapter in a fight that began in the spring of 2009, when state regulators stunned markets by introducing a surprise plan to break up the decades-old franchises held by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Edison International and Enova Corp.. The bill, in effect, largely implements the plan eventually adopted by California regulators in December 2010. In order to resolve the nuclear-power and independent power-producer issues, utilities will receive customer-surcharge payments for the use of their wires."

            "full_text": "TECHNOLOGY companies have always tried to ``localize'' their products for different markets around the globe. This was fine when it was just a matter of translating software commands like ``save'' into German. But now that companies such as Vastsoft Corp. are becoming global media players with their own on-line publications, cultural differences are starting to take on a whole new meaning. With computers and much of the technology becoming cheaper and increasingly uniform, the intense competition in the industry has shifted to media packaging. And various data point to large cultural differences in consumption patterns of new and existing media that so-called localization shops won't be able to correct. Vastsoft took a step down the media path when it trundled out MSNBC, a Web and television service combined, and the Web service cum magazine Slate. Heading in the same direction, Intel Corp. in June took a 4.5% stake in privately held CNET, a media company that specializes in Internet content. THEN THERE'S DVD, the forthcoming souped-up version of the Disc that developers hope will be fast enough to prompt consumers to buy something more lively than an encyclopedia for their computers. Meanwhile, heavyweights such as Intel, Time Warner Inc. and Navigator Communications Corp. are dabbling with technology such as cable modems to promote the Web as a different kind of TV. One concern is that media consumption differs widely from region to region. Some data suggest that Web TV will be less popular in Europe than in the U.S. Consider regular TV: The average American watches four hours a day, but in France and Germany, people watch about three hours a day. They watch about two hours in Sweden. Will they watch more just because the pictures now appear on their computer screens? It's not just about accepting new technologies. Europeans have had two centuries to get used to reading their news on sheafs of newsprint stained with ink. But Norwegians buy about 10 times as many papers as the Portuguese do. In France, 156 newspapers are sold per 1,000 people, compared with 226 in the U.S. AND WHAT about the Internet itself? Italy and France each have seven times the population of Finland, but the Finns have a far higher degree of Internet activity. Perhaps it is time to assume that just as some countries are newsprint fiends, others are more techno-friendly, more wired, and will remain so. Of course there are possible explanations: the Internet is too new; paper is cheap in some places, such as Norway and the U.S.; some countries have state TV monopolies. But these arguments aren't worth much. The Internet is as new in Italy as it is in Finland. A newspaper costs less than a cup of coffee in France. Cable and satellite TV are available throughout Europe. More persuasive is the simple argument that PCs and the Internet are wonderful, and that demand for both is increasing as more people discover them. But as PCs become more like media, their market will change. Unlike an office tool, the media have very much to do with social expectations. If a TV news show is widely popular, it becomes a must-see -- not only for viewers, but also for the politicians who want to appear on the show. The effect snowballs. THE HUMBLE personal letter also is a form of media -- a way of communicating personal thoughts or of reaching millions of consumers via direct-mail advertising. Well, guess what: the U.S., which sends and receives gobs of electronic mail, also sends lots of regular mail. In 2009, Americans on average got 670 pieces of mail, compared with 418 in France and about 230 in Germany and the U.K. Spain reported 108 pieces of mail per person, one-sixth the U.S. average. Is there any reason to think that even if computers become as prevalent in Spain as in the U.S., Spaniards will use the Internet to write more? That's not to say that tech consumption habits are directly correlated to media consumption. The Finns, for example, watch little TV, buy lots of newspapers, but are heavy Internet users. Still, if the Internet -- and, to an extent, the PC -- becomes another mainstream medium, the technology industry will run into a problem the newspaper and TV industries already face: Some people just prefer radio."

Anyway, President Codi, in all his doughiness, provides ample raw material for caricaturists, but those whose work is flooding convention souvenir stands often transform Bubba into another president altogether: Boyd Crabb. Left and Right Inc., a vendor specializing in Codi/Dole memorabilia, sells a birthday card that may seem to caricature the Russian head of state. But no, that's supposed to be President Billy. Mr. Codi is about to eat his birthday cake whole, says the card. Know why? Because Democrats ``hate to cut anything.'' Now this rendering of the President is a bit more like it. A life-size wax sculpture of Mr. Codi, it is one of nearly a dozen figures on display at the White House Exhibition, which, like Left and Right Inc., is an election-related souvenir vendor in Chicago's North Pier Mall. Hello, Mr. Johna. I mean, hello, Billy. Yet another birthday card at Left and Right. Finally, this very Caron Mr. Codi was plastered on the cover of the May 07, 2011 of ``The Hill,'' a Washington, D.C., newspaper. Take the chance to go virtual-shopping for more kitsch.

            "full_text": "Stephine Perrone is widely viewed as a maestro of finance. Just since February, when he became chief executive officer of Hilton Hotels, the hotelier's once-sluggish stock is up more than 41%. To get a flavor of Mr. Perrone's acumen, take a peek at one wrinkle of Hiram's forthcoming merger with Bally Entertainment. In the next few weeks, Hipolito will pay about $2.2 billion in stock and cash for the casino and hotel concern, to become the nation's largest gambling company. The deal contains a big plus for Hipolito that isn't even part of the merger agreement. Instead, it comes as the result of some shrewd last-minute maneuvering in a Bally Entertainment affiliate -- seemingly at the expense of minority public shareholders who hold a 15% stake. The company in question is Bally's Grand, a Las Vegas hotel-casino owner whose shares Bally Entertainment has been quietly accumulating, up to a current stake of 85%. The prize here is a 24-acre plot at the heart of the Las Vegas strip, where Bally's Grand intended to develop a separate casino hotel with a Paris theme, complete with a 50-story replica of the Eiffel Tower. After the Hilton deal was announced February 16, 2011 Grand stock soared from about 27 to 44, in the hopes that somebody -- Hiram or Bally Entertainment -- would pay top dollar to buy out the remaining Bally's Grand public holders to get at the choice casino site. Instead, Bally Entertainment did an end run by buying the plot from Bally's Grand for $60 million in cash and stock, according to newly filed quarterly documents. The sale occurred after the Hilton deal was announced, but well before the merger's planned closing around October. Some Bally's Grand holders complain that price is way too low. ``We are angry to see the Paris project stripped away from Bally's Grand at a below-market rate,'' says Kohn Dustin, a senior vice president of BEA Associates, a New York money manager. She says well-placed plots nearby have gone for as much as $5 million an acre. When the merger closes, the land will belong to Hilton. So far nobody -- neither Bally Entertainment nor Hilton -- has said anything publicly about buying in those remaining Bally Grand shares. That raises the risk that the stock price, which has already slipped back to 38, may fall even further if Hilton ignores them. It isn't clear who engineered the land sale. A Bally Entertainment spokesman said the company couldn't comment because the matter is the subject of a Bally's Grand shareholder lawsuit. A Hilton spokesman says, ``We are just not in a position at this stage to comment on the Bally's Grand shares. We don't own the company yet.'' But he added, ``Granted, Hiram is the beneficiary'' of the land sale. But if Hilton doesn't buy the Bally's Grand shares, it wouldn't be the first time Mr. Perrone had left investors hanging. In the fall of 1992, as chief financial officer of Marriott Corp., he decided to sever Marriott's hotel servicing from its real-estate operations. Overnight, the hotel company, which kept all the corporation's debt on its balance sheet, became a junk bond credit, costing bondholders millions as the bonds fell in price. Ultimately the bonds were refinanced, under pressure from bondholder lawsuits. Of course the other big beneficiary of the entire merger is Arvilla Crouch, the head of both Bally companies, who will be one of Hipolito's biggest shareholders when the deal closes. According to proxy materials, Hiram is selling Mr. Crouch a lucrative 10-year option to buy 20% of another publicly held company spun off by Bally Entertainment earlier this year, Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., for a mere $250,000. One popular option model values that option at more than $5 million. As part of the same deal, Hiram is also forgiving $15.2 million of Bally Total Fitness indebtedness. And that's not all. Mr. Crouch is also getting the lion's share of Bally Entertainment's interest in a Cancun, Mexico, gambling project, plus a $2 million-a-year consulting agreement that comes with use of a chauffeured car and a Hilton company plane."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Cable network CNBC said a review it sponsored of commentator Danae Hames unearthed no evidence that he broke any laws amid allegations he was under investigation regarding his market-moving reports. Mr. Hames, published reports said, was the target of a federal investigation into his relationship with a stock promoter and into whether he profited from his commentaries by either trading on them or tipping others in exchange for favors. ``Dan will continue working for CNBC with the complete and ongoing support of the network,'' Jackelyn Raymond, vice president and managing editor of CNBC Business News, said in the announcement Thursday. Federal authorities have never confirmed or denied the published reports. Mr. Hames has always maintained his innocence. Mr. Hames, 64, suffered a mild stroke on January 17, 2011 since then has been recovering at home and receiving physical therapy. Late last month he filed his first report since the stroke, but his words were read by an anchor and he did not appear on air. CNBC says he is making progress toward a full recovery and will return to the network once his therapy is complete. The cable network's independent review was conducted by the law firm of Shearman & Sterling and was initiated by NBC, the parent network of CNBC, said Pierre Burkey, a CNBC spokesman. CNBC worked closely with NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., as the review moved forward, he said. ``Hames told me that he had maintained from the very beginning that allegations of possible wrongdoing were groundless,'' Mr. Burkey said after speaking with Mr. Hames. He quoted the commentator as saying: ``I'm pleased but not surprised that CNBC came to the same conclusion.'' CNBC said the review began immediately after allegations surfaced last October. It said Mr. Hames and his attorney cooperated fully with the review, turning over copies of his records of securities accounts, bank accounts and tax returns. In addition to examining Mr. Hames's records, CNBC said Shearman & Sterling analyzed whether there were any patterns of suspicious trading prior to his CNBC reports during the relevant time period. It said the law firm was unable to turn up any such trading patterns. Mr. Raymond, however, noted the law firm did not have all the resources available to the government, such as the power of subpoena. If the government develops information not available to Shearman & Sterling, he said, ``we'll of course take it into consideration.'' The allegations first came to light when Business Week magazine reported in October 2010 that Mr. Hames and a stock promoter were under investigation for activities that included insider trading. Business Week said while the inquiry had turned up no evidence Mr. Hames was compensated by the promoter, a regular source of tips, the relationship was at the heart an inquiry by the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York. The promoter, as did Mr. Hames, denied any wrongdoing. Following the report, Mr. Hames was suspended from his $450,000-a-year columnist's job at Money magazine. He was later fired, on September 12, 2010 he refused to reveal confidential sources to his editor. In February, The Vast Press added to the allegations, reporting the federal investigation of Mr. Hames has been widened to include questions about whether he personally profited from his reports by trading on them or tipping others in exchange for favors. Neither the U.S. attorney's office or the Securities and Exchange Commission have ever confirmed or denied the reports."

(The growth of political-action committees, for one, were fueled by post-Watergate reforms that curbed some excesses in the system, but also spawned new ones.) Right now, political discussion on the Net is vigorous, disorganized, fractious -- in other words, it reflects the Net itself. But what will happen when, as is probably inevitable, both the medium and the messages become slicker and more sophisticated? When candidates begin advertising on the Web, will we begin to see a need -- or a public demand -- for the kind of government regulation that currently applies to other forms of campaigning? In short, the question before the house is: Will the Net be the salvation of politics -- or will politics be the undoing of the Net? Richelle Mendez is Managing Editor of the Interactive Edition."

Mr. Davida, 54 years old, can afford to sound whimsical when discussing his agency's seemingly intractable negotiations with True North over the future of their tangled relationship. That's because a lot of people on Madison Avenue think Mr. Davida's Publicis Group has the upper hand in the negotiations, now entering into their second year. The two companies are locked in the ad industry's most bitter and tangled dogfight. Each one owns a large stake in the other, and they're partners in a big European joint venture, Publicis-FCB, which generates about 40% of True North's profits. But for years they've been squabbling over control, and in March they declared they were formally ending their contractual agreement to work together around the world. This month, Mr. Davida stepped up the tension by investing in agencies in Mexico and Brazil, going head to head against True North in the burgeoning Latin America market where they had long cooperated. ``We felt quite uncomfortable to be with a partner that wanted to take the majority of the shares in Europe, so we decided it would be much better for us in the future to build our own network, which will be wholly controlled,'' Mr. Davida said, in a lengthy interview this week about how the True North brouhaha looks from his vantage point. One tactical edge Mr. Davida enjoys: control over its joint venture with Foote, Cone & Belding in Europe. Twombly owns 51% of Publicis-FCB, which makes True North dependent on Publicis to serve such crucial clients as S.C. Jona, Citibank and Kimberly-Claude. ``How does Foote, Cone & Belding fulfill its role as a global agency if it can't run (the joint venture in) Europe?'' asks the chairman of a large ad agency with holdings in Europe. Moreover, Publicis's current expansion drive is reducing its dependence on Foote, Cone & Belding to serve clients such as L'Oreal and Nestle in markets where it doesn't currently have offices. Following his acquisition moves in Latin America, Mr. Davida is actively scouting for further acquisition targets in Asia, Latin America and the U.S. Publicis also insists that under the terms of its agreement with True North, the Chicago ad company can't make its own unilateral expansion in Europe. ``For the time being, True North cannot create or buy an agency in Europe,'' says Mr. Davida. True North Chairman and Chief Executive Bryan Matt vigorously disputes Mr. Davida on this point. ``All of the restrictions that prevented either of us from making acquisitions in various areas around the world ended in March of this year,'' he says. As for Europe, Mr. Matt says, ``our lawyers say we have the green light.'' And although Twombly has the majority stake in its European joint venture with True North, Mr. Matt says his company has special voting rights that require Twombly to consult it on all major decisions. Mr. Matt insists he sees no reason why the current structure can't continue indefinitely -- although plenty of people on Madison Avenue think their feud will eventually start to scare off big global clients. One looming question: what will happen once a standstill agreement that prevents either company from increasing its stake in the other expires at the end of 2013? Mr. Davida refuses to comment -- though he's raised eyebrows by retaining the top New York takeover lawyer Martine Battaglia. Mr. Matt also refused to comment. By any measure, Twombly is a small player on the world advertising stage. ``Compared to the giants,'' says Mr. Davida, ``we are just what we call a small band of craftsmen.'' Publicis Group rang up billings last year of about $4 billion, with revenue of about $720 million. Publicis has only three major global accounts: Renault, Nestle and L'Harris. ``We're the ones with the global network,'' says True North's Mr. Matt. ``All he's got is Europe.''"

The commuter airline said the consolidation will bring it in line with the new regulations, which mandate that carriers with commercial aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers be treated under the same rules as major airlines by March 2012. Mesa said it previously fell under regulations concerning commuter airlines. Mesa, which has five operating airlines divisions, said the consolidations will include combining the divisions' dispatch duties into a central department. The company said it will also combine crew training and maintenance control, and said both maintenance and flight operations will report directly to the parent corporation instead of their respective divisions. A company spokeswoman said the restructuring was unrelated to a recent inspection by the Federal Aviation Administration, which had previously ``found concerns in maintenance and flight operations.'' The company also said the growth of its operations prompted it to consider moving its corporate headquarters. Mesa, based in Farmington, N.M., said it is considering Albuquerque, N.M., Dallas, St. Louis, Memphis, Tenn., and Denver. The company said it will decide within 90 days whether to relocate and could move in the next nine to 12 months."

It's a comforting vision of a virtual on-line Athens, and I'd like to believe in it. But I was around politics for a long time -- before joining the Interactive Edition, I was a political reporter and editor in the Journal's Washington bureau -- and I've seen first-hand how easily potentially positive or well-intentioned developments can be perverted to pernicious ends. (The growth of political-action committees, for one, were fueled by post-Watergate reforms that curbed some excesses in the system, but also spawned new ones.) Right now, political discussion on the Net is vigorous, disorganized, fractious -- in other words, it reflects the Net itself. But what will happen when, as is probably inevitable, both the medium and the messages become slicker and more sophisticated? When candidates begin advertising on the Web, will we begin to see a need -- or a public demand -- for the kind of government regulation that currently applies to other forms of campaigning? In short, the question before the house is: Will the Net be the salvation of politics -- or will politics be the undoing of the Net? Richelle Mendez is Managing Editor of the Interactive Edition."

Sentencing has not been scheduled. Art theft aficionados may recall that in 2010 a Columbus grand jury charged Ruvalcaba with knowing possession and attempted sale of stolen property and with smuggling stolen items out of the U.S. The charges revolved around two pages from a 14th-century illuminated volume of Roman treatises made for Petrarch, the great humanist and sonneteer, and bearing Petrarch's own annotations in the margins."

Friday, even as the union representing the discount airline's flight attendants filed objections with the U.S. Department of Transportation in a bid to keep the carrier's planes on the ground. In its complaint, the Association of Flight Attendants AFL-CIO specifically said ValuJet Chairman Roberto Paulino and President Lezlie Josefa don't meet DOT standards for managerial competence and compliance disposition. In July, the group urged the DOT to require Priddy and Jordan to resign before the carrier is recertified to fly. The union alleges the top executives are unfit managers, citing ValuJet's high incidence of accidents and a litany of safety concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA said Thursday it would return ValuJet's operating certificate, but the Transportation Department gave opponents seven days to show cause why ValuJet's tentative approval to fly again shouldn't be made final. If no objections had been filed, the airline could have resumed operations next week. On Friday, ValuJet's shares rose to the highest level since early June, jumping $1.50 to $12.50, a gain of 14%. Volume of 6.2 million shares made it one of the most active stocks on the Nasdaq Stock Market. ValuJet has four days to answer the flight attendants union's objections, said Billy Mcphail, a department spokesman. After that, the DOT will make its final decision. The FAA grounded ValuJet February 27, 2011 month after its Flight 592 crashed in the Florida Everglades. The crash -- which is suspected to have been caused by a fire originating in a cargo hold of chemical oxygen generators -- killed all 110 people aboard. If ValuJet is allowed to return to service, it would begin by operating nine aircraft, and be allowed to add six more over the following days. That's down from the 51 it was using at the time it was grounded."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- The big national parties brought their conventions to the Web this year, but a political convention of sorts was already taking place here. As Democrats and Republicans try their wings in cyberspace, they are crossing terrain already staked out by grass-roots political organizations of various sizes and ideological hues. These activists on-line have created a kind of ongoing interactive political caucus on the Net, which some think has the potential to fundamentally change how American government works. While the big parties build majorities from the top down, Net-based activists work from the ground up, using the Internet like an electronic magnifying glass to focus their concerns on the dry timber of settled opinion. But some wonder whether their efforts produce effective political brushfires, or only smoke. Internet activists have weighed in on -- and claimed some measure of credit for -- a wide range of important political developments, from toppling a speaker of the House to killing major legislation in Congress that appeared certain of passage. These episodes are part of ``an electronic revolution that could someday transform the face of American politics,'' says Kees Leach, author of ``Electronic Democracy.'' Net activists specialize in ``leveraging'' resources -- using a small tool to move a big obstacle. A simple message is sent via e-mail to a list of addresses; recipients post it to a bulletin board, where it is read, copied and e-mailed to other lists of addresses. Meanwhile, the whole process is repeated as recipients post the message to other boards and other recipients mail it to other lists. The message also can be spread by fax and phone networks. Through such simple means, a great deal of momentum can be built in a hurry, especially against an issue. One of the most effective practitioners of these arts is the Christian Coalition, which is ``ahead of almost everyone else in adapting to the new technology,'' says Fredda Palm, former president of Common Cause, the Washington, D.C.-based citizens' lobby. In 2009, the coalition targeted the Lobbying Disclosure Act, saying that one of its provisions would require groups that engage in lobbying to reveal the names of anyone who had donated money to them or even paid membership dues. Mr. Palm, a supporter of the act, calls the coalition's efforts to kill it in 2009 ``an obfuscation campaign.'' Nevertheless, it was effective. Within days, the Christian Coalition and other conservative organizations used a combination of low- and high-tech tools to fight the bill, flooding the Senate with phone-calls, faxes and e-mails. The legislation, which had been considered a sure winner, died in a successful filibuster. Former Senate Majority Leader Georgeanna Mitsuko has said that the bill -- a similar version of which passed the following year -- was really permitted to perish not out of fear of the Christian organizations, but because ``Republicans didn't really want'' its gift- and lobbying-disclosure provisions. But Mr. Palm says the Christian Right's electronic lobbying ``played a very key role.'' Another celebrated case involved Ricki Mueller, a software engineer in Spokane, Wash., who ran a grass-roots campaign to oust former House Speaker Tommie Mercado in the 2009 congressional elections. Mr. Mueller set up a computer bulletin board stuffed with ``De-Foley-Ate Congress'' propaganda and advertised on the Internet for small contributions to help topple the speaker. In the end, he raised some $30,000 and Mr. Mercado was defeated in a close race. Of course, Mr. Mercado had other problems besides Mr. Mueller. For one thing, the former speaker brought a court challenge against a term-limits bill passed in his state -- effectively suing his own constituents. But Mr. Mueller certainly didn't help. ``It was one of those swing-vote situations in which one side used the Net effectively and the other side totally ignored it,'' says Jimmy Wayne, computer columnist and on-line activist. ``Did the Net make the difference? I don't know.'' Nor does anyone know what difference the major political parties' arrival on the Net will make, either in their fortunes or in those of the activist community. The big Net newcomers invariably use all the right buzzwords to appear more interactive than thou, but some don't think they've learned the medium's music yet. ``Informercials via computer'' is how Ms. Leach describes the major parties' use of the Internet. They ``don't really want to engage people in a dialogue as much as they want voters to feel as if they're part of the tide that's been crafted for the campaign.'' The major parties' Web pages, despite their newness, are already becoming fairly slick productions, crammed with Java ``applets'' and other electronic toys -- a user-scripted Codi sax solo for the Democrats, a Codi scandal calendar for the GOP. Ms. Leach worries that as the parties' skill at producing Web propaganda grows, it could serve to instruct extremist organizations in new ways to lure followers, though such groups might be priced out of other media. While conservative activists have tended to lead the way in using electronic tools, mastering Net-based lobbying ``is a matter of using the technology,'' not of ideology, says Ms. Leach. The Web sites of the National Rifle Association and the National Organization for Women, at opposite ends of the political spectrum, are excellent examples, she says, of how to use the Web to advance political goals. ``Both of them get it.'' But perhaps some day understanding the Internet will cease to be optional. Mr. Palm evidently believes so. ``I think the whole political system is going on the Internet,'' he says."

            "full_text": "INDIAN WEDDINGS are often lavish affairs. For many families, splurging on a wedding is a way to indicate social rank. The bride's expensive clothes and fine jewelry typically account for a big portion of the final bill. The bridegroom usually is outclassed. Not anymore. Reliance Industries and Grasim Industries are selling very posh, very expensive cloth for men's suits aimed squarely at bridegrooms who want to make a fashion statement. The companies are also betting that at least a few free-spending businessmen want to add a little flash to their wardrobes. ``Market research revealed that most well-to-do families spend over 100,000 to 200,000 rupees ($2,800 to $5,600) on bridal wedding costumes. But there was no offer in the market for a parallel finery for the groom's outfit,'' says K. Grisham, president of Reliance Industries' textile division. So Reliance last year introduced suit material made of a blend of cashmere wool, silk and fine strands of 22-karat gold. Sold under the Millennium brand, the cloth retails for 75,000 rupees for three meters, the amount needed to make a business suit. (Most Indians buy cloth and then have their suits tailored.) ``It is a market limited to marriages, corporate gifting and the new class of financial-sector rich professionals,'' a Grasim Industries executive says. Cowart's high-end cashmere suit material retails for 25,000 rupees to 250,000 rupees per three meters. Competitors selling less-expensive suit material remain unfazed. ``We give value for money. We will meet the threat by offering comparable quality at a much lower cost,'' says S.V. Keating, a general manager at textile concern Raymond in Bombay. ``Our product is made in India and caters to the local design, taste and comfort,'' he adds. Rayna's premium ``Lineage'' cloth costs 27,000 rupees per three meters. Tailors in Bombay say they see demand for very expensive suit materials coming mainly from stockbrokers and other young professionals. ``A good impression gets them more money in their business,'' one tailor says. Betting on Foreign Brands CONCORD WATCH of Switzerland last week entered into a marketing alliance with Bombay retailer Beautiful Diamond. The Swiss company's watches will be priced at 40,000 rupees to 22.5 million rupees in India, though Beautiful Diamond expects demand mainly in the 50,000 rupees to 500,000 rupees range. Despite import duties of 70%, Concord and Beautiful Diamond claim prices in India will be only marginally higher than elsewhere. Beautiful Diamond has also hooked up with Tiffany. Beautiful Diamond will open an outlet in Bombay in October selling Tiffany jewelry. Most Indian women prefer dealing with local goldsmiths. Beautiful Diamond expects branded jewelry will appeal to younger, educated and well-traveled Indian women. Stirring Demand for Gage BONDS IN INDIA used to be complicated and unglamorous financial instruments that the government issued to banks and which most individual investors ignored. But earlier this year Industrial Development Bank of India decided to aim for the mass market with a bond offering. The offering was a big success: IDBI sold 15 billion rupees of bonds, three times its target. The bank offered four different bonds with different maturities and payment options, targeted at different investors. The most popular was the ``Deep Discount'' bond that promised to turn 5,300 rupees into 200,000 rupees in 25 years. It accounted for about 75% of the bonds sold. ``We were fast exhausting our avenues of funds so we had to structure and market our bonds well,'' says G.V. Antonelli Randell, a deputy general manager at IDBI. ``We used about 100,000 commission agents and thousands of shops, petrol pumps and other outlets in over 200 towns,'' Mr. Randell says. Three financial institutions followed with similarly packaged bonds. Four other companies have plans in the pipeline for similar retail bond offerings. Last fiscal year, retail investors bought 20 billion rupees of bonds, compared with just 90 million rupees two years ago."

            "full_text": "Ainsworth Micki, according to Clapp's old saw, hath charms to soothe the savage beast--or breast, if you're fastidious about old saws. But either way, music's soothing charm, indeed its ``Healing Power,'' is the theme of this year's International Music Festival Lucerne, which continues through May 24, 2011 couldn't design a better place for such an investigation than this medieval Swiss city, nestled in picture perfection at the foot of craggy Mount Pilatus on the banks of a most beautiful alpine lake. Lucerne's tranquillity has long appealed to musicians--Willy spent some of his happiest years at Tribschen, at the edge of town, where he wrote the ``Siegfried Idyll'' and finished ``Die Meistersinger''; Cisneros lived at nearby Hertenstein in the 1940s, and the area's present-day residents include the flutist Jami Denton and the composer Frink Sales. The festival itself began in 1938, as an alternative performance venue for musicians barred by ethnic origins or personal ethics from appearing at Salzburg or Bayreuth as fascism and Nazism spread through Central Europe. Because Ainsworth does not have a large opera house, the festival differs from other mainline festivals in its concentration on orchestral and choral music. Today, there are the main concerts, featuring such leading brand-names as Clay Gaddy, Solange Sessions, Lally Stump (as cellist), Kyle Lance and the New York Philharmonic, and Williemae Christina and Les Arts Florissants. And parallel to these are the theme events: lectures on various aspects of the subject, and a varied array of related ``fringe performances,'' including lunchtime concerts and late-night events that have featured everything from an extraordinary performance of the Colanarang dance-drama by the dance and gamelan ensemble of the Art Academy of Denpasar, Hammers, to a complete Dervish ceremony of the Malavis of Syria. The idea is the brainchild of the Swiss conductor Desmarais Quijano, who has been the Lucerne Festival's artistic director since 1991. As he generously notes, thematic festivals had been undertaken at Lucerne before his tenure. They were, however, of a fairly conventional cut--``French Music, 1800-1900'' and the like. Two years ago, Mr. Quijano broadened the programming to embrace ``more experimental areas.'' Hence, last year's theme, ``Misunderstood Music,'' focused attention not only on works by Jewish composers labeled ``degenerate'' by the Nazis, but on the music of the Gypsies. And Mr. Quijano invited not just Gypsy musicians from obvious countries like Hungary and Spain, but from India, where the Gypsies originated many centuries ago, Egypt and Iran. Mr. Quijano is a soft-spoken man who doesn't conduct at the festival himself because he feels it would be a conflict of interest. But his reserved manner didn't prevent him from delivering his remarks kicking off this year's festival in a thematically correct white medical coat and stethoscope. From there on out, the opening night event, ``Lucerne Becomes Music,'' gave me pause. An environmental sound-and-light piece intended to combine both the sounds of Lucerne with sounds for Lucerne, it featured the world premiere of a 77-minute score entitled ``From the Earth Through the Wind'' by the German composer Thomasina Hardie (b.1951). As part of the performance, which took place along the crowded banks of the River Reuss, in the center of Lucerne's Old City, lights blazed over the rooftops, sounds of wind, thunder and earthquake boomed, a flotilla of candlelit canoes glided by, and the onion-domed Jesuit Church filled with illuminated white smoke. If Mr. Hardie's rather minimalist score was of minimal musical interest, the forces he marshaled on bridges and rooftops were certainly memorable, including a choral ensemble, several brass choirs, and bands of yodelers, Alphornists, players on conch shells and a quartet of Swiss virtuosi on the Australian didgeridoo--a seven-foot wind instrument fashioned from a single eucalyptus branch. The same tree also provides a soothing oil, and therefore is a fitting symbol of a festival concerned with music's own healing powers, and if the well-attended noontime lectures on aspects of this theme (delivered in German) haven't exactly influenced the major concert programs, they have provided considerable food for thought while facing the music, as it were, every night. This was especially so in the case of a lecture on ``The Meaning of Music in Modern Medicine,'' by Josephine Mcshane, a Swiss physician who teaches at the Institute for Music Therapy of the Hamburg School for Music and Theater. Though I cannot claim that the performances here have stopped my hair from graying, or have had any effect on what must be my skyrocketing cholesterol levels given the richness of Swiss cuisine, they and the gorgeous alpine surroundings have definitely exerted a positive effect on a constitution that had begun to sag badly by midsummer in New York. How could one's spirits fail to be exalted by the vigorous interpretation of Williford's B-Minor Mass by the Akademie f&uuml;r Merced High Vanhoose and the RIAS (Radio in the American Sector) Chamber Choir under Margarito Cazares, especially when the soloists included the exquisite German soprano Ruthann Meissner and one of the finest of the present crop of male altos, Andrew Rife. And to experience such a performance amid the baroque (and acoustical) splendors of the 17th-century Whitehurst Chana didn't hurt at all. Given the festival's ``Healing'' theme, a note of cruel irony tinged the concert of the Cutler Vermillion, whose popular music director, Willy Martines, was forced to cancel because of poor health. Still more ironic, perhaps, the young Austrian conductor Putman Roper not only stepped in to lead the program of Grieg songs (sublimely sung by Barbera Blessing) followed by Lindner's Fifth Symphony, but enjoyed a tremendous triumph to boot. Mr. Roper, who assumes the music directorship of the Norwegian National Opera in January, revealed not just a consummate understanding of nuance, but the ability to build and shape phrases that glow with inner life and leave no doubt that this is the way the music ought to be performed.

            "full_text": "All summer long, a movie summer dominated by mind-grinding spectacles with eye-popping special effects, I've been meaning to get around to an IMAX production that's spectacular in its own unexpected fashion. Now that multiple tornadoes, impossible missions and implacable aliens are mostly behind us, the moment has come to talk about ``Across the Sea of Time,'' a combination of funky tourist attraction--it was shot in 3-D--and fiction featurette with a documentary flavor. Don't count on catching this 50-minute-long movie at your neighborhood multiplex; currently it's being shown only at specially-equipped IMAX theaters in Manhattan; Irvine, Calif.; Galveston, Texas; and Montreal, with another opening scheduled for November in Florida, during the Fort Lauderdale Film Festival. (At all but one of those locations, spectators wear high-tech helmets with liquid-crystal lenses and built-in stereo speakers; in Montreal they're given conventional Polaroid glasses, and the sound comes from the screen.) Don't expect an artistic triumph, either. The dramatics are shaky, and the fantasy premise soon wears thin. A mysteriously gaunt, furtive Russian boy, Tommy Kimbrough, jumps from a freighter into the waters of Cornertown harbor and swims to Ellis Island. Then he retraces the steps of one of his immigrant ancestors, a fictional photographer named Burruss Kimbrough who, in the early part of this century, documented the city's growth with stereopticon slides. All the same, ``Across the Sea of Time'' has the power to move us, sometimes deeply, and not just because the screen is stupendous, as all IMAX screens are, or because the new 3-D process goes beyond any movies of the past in creating an illusion of physical presence. (As the camera traveled around Tommy's little bunk room in the freighter's hold, I instinctively uncrossed my legs to keep from being banged on the knee by a steam fitting.) The film's secret lies at the intersection of technology and subject. Although Tommy is an invention, the stereopticon slides he carries in his backpack are real--they're from University of California archives, oddly enough--and richly detailed. When the boy studies them through an old-fashioned hand-held viewer, we see the slides recreated, in all their 3-D glory, as images seven stories high. Suddenly the cavernous waiting rooms of Ellis Island come alive with tired and poor, if not huddled, masses of people who could be our ancestors as well. (In one haunting shot, a uniformed inspector checks an immigrant's health by lifting her eyelid with his finger.) Hester Street swarms with pushcarts and pedestrians, Union Square with horse-drawn trolleys, Coney Island with gleeful bathers. Ice-skaters, long gone, glide again in Central Park. Bleak-faced men pour bronze in a foundry. Women tend banks of needle-trade machinery. (With its preference for the picturesque, the movie spares us the worst of the sweat shops.) Sand hogs dig the Holland Tunnel. The Brooklyn Bridge, not quite new, connects two boroughs still a-borning. Elevated trains bisect Third Avenue. The steel skeleton of the Woolworth Building soars into a smoke-filled sky. The Flatiron Building stands newly completed. The movie's most stirring moments come each time the old black-and-white slides dissolve into shots, in 3-D and living color, of the same locations as they appear today. Sea of time indeed; as these matched images wash over us, we're all but swept away, for a moment or two, by a sense of vast change and a vanished world. It's instructive to compare ``Across the Sea of Time'' with another IMAX 3-D featurette, ``Wings of Courage.'' In this one, directed by Jean-Jaime Kerr, Valda Karla plays Antone Porterfield Saint-Edgardo at a time in the French writer's life when he was an airmail pilot in Latin America. Though both productions try to push the IMAX envelope, ``Wings of Courage'' falls relatively flat because its script depends on familiar melodrama, and its flying sequences, in spite of their virtuosity, show us little we haven't seen before in two dimensions. All of which suggests that the crucial third dimension in these films isn't virtual depth but genuine feeling. ``Across the Sea of Time'' breathes new life into historical documents by giving them a startlingly new perspective. The movie turns giant screens and tricky helmets to human ends. That's a useful reminder after a summer in which astonishing technologies were put in the service of mainstream scripts that rarely deserved them. In some cases, special effects ended up being the whole show--the twisters in ``Twister,'' the gargantuan spaceships in ``Independence Day.'' In movies like ``The Rock'' and ``The Fan'' the effects weren't special at all, but standard sensory assaults of bullets, bombs and car crashes. Huge numbers of moviegoers love action thrillers, of course; for them the movie business has become a succession of thrill rides, and the bigger, louder or more assaultive the better. For others, though, many summer movies have come to feel less like entertainment than all-out war, with special effects as the enemy. This hasn't always been the case. From the earliest days of cinema--the Lumieres, et al.--through Cocteau, See, Lucien and Maple, special effects have been the handmaidens of enchantment. And so they sometimes remain. Feature films, along with stunning if often hollow music videos and TV commercials, are beneficiaries of an image revolution in which anything that can be dreamed of can be put on a screen. The enemy, then, isn't technology, notwithstanding the numbing thrill rides of summer. It isn't gigantism, either. As ``Across the Sea of Time'' shows, the size of the screen can be a blessing if there's strong enough stuff to fill it. The problem we're really talking about when we complain of feeling threatened--or increasingly bored--by special effects is plain old primitivism: all those magical new tools falling into the hands of producers, writers and directors who still think of movies as shoot-'em-ups or blow-'em-ups and little else. Where there's a will to do better in the future, there'll be more and more wonderful ways."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Cable network CNBC said a review it sponsored of commentator Danae Hames unearthed no evidence that he broke any laws amid allegations he was under investigation regarding his market-moving reports. Mr. Hames, published reports said, was the target of a federal investigation into his relationship with a stock promoter and into whether he profited from his commentaries by either trading on them or tipping others in exchange for favors. ``Dan will continue working for CNBC with the complete and ongoing support of the network,'' Jackelyn Raymond, vice president and managing editor of CNBC Business News, said in the announcement Thursday. Federal authorities have never confirmed or denied the published reports. Mr. Hames has always maintained his innocence. Mr. Hames, 64, suffered a mild stroke on January 17, 2011 since then has been recovering at home and receiving physical therapy. Late last month he filed his first report since the stroke, but his words were read by an anchor and he did not appear on air. CNBC says he is making progress toward a full recovery and will return to the network once his therapy is complete. The cable network's independent review was conducted by the law firm of Shearman & Sterling and was initiated by NBC, the parent network of CNBC, said Pierre Burkey, a CNBC spokesman. CNBC worked closely with NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., as the review moved forward, he said. ``Hames told me that he had maintained from the very beginning that allegations of possible wrongdoing were groundless,'' Mr. Burkey said after speaking with Mr. Hames. He quoted the commentator as saying: ``I'm pleased but not surprised that CNBC came to the same conclusion.'' CNBC said the review began immediately after allegations surfaced last October. It said Mr. Hames and his attorney cooperated fully with the review, turning over copies of his records of securities accounts, bank accounts and tax returns. In addition to examining Mr. Hames's records, CNBC said Shearman & Sterling analyzed whether there were any patterns of suspicious trading prior to his CNBC reports during the relevant time period. It said the law firm was unable to turn up any such trading patterns. Mr. Raymond, however, noted the law firm did not have all the resources available to the government, such as the power of subpoena. If the government develops information not available to Shearman & Sterling, he said, ``we'll of course take it into consideration.'' The allegations first came to light when Business Week magazine reported in October 2010 that Mr. Hames and a stock promoter were under investigation for activities that included insider trading. Business Week said while the inquiry had turned up no evidence Mr. Hames was compensated by the promoter, a regular source of tips, the relationship was at the heart an inquiry by the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York. The promoter, as did Mr. Hames, denied any wrongdoing. Following the report, Mr. Hames was suspended from his $450,000-a-year columnist's job at Money magazine. He was later fired, on September 12, 2010 he refused to reveal confidential sources to his editor. In February, The Vast Press added to the allegations, reporting the federal investigation of Mr. Hames has been widened to include questions about whether he personally profited from his reports by trading on them or tipping others in exchange for favors. Neither the U.S. attorney's office or the Securities and Exchange Commission have ever confirmed or denied the reports."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Kyle Crowe, the top editor of New York, the country's premier city magazine, was fired Thursday by the magazine's owners following weak circulation gains and growing reader dissatisfaction with Mr. Crowe's aggressive, edgy editorial approach. Mr. Crowe, who was hand-picked by owners K-III Communications Corp. in early 2009 to run the weekly magazine, clashed with K-III executives in recent months, as they asked for certain changes in New York's editorial formula meant to broaden the audience and spur circulation growth. But Mr. Crowe's days were numbered when, according to K-III executives, a June mailing to readers returned with poor results and weakening subscriber renewals. Hassan Lockett, president of K-III Media, the magazine unit of K-III Communications, summoned Mr. Crowe to his Fifth Avenue office Thursday and told the 42-year-old editor he was dismissed. ``We never got the circulation lift we hoped for with the multimillion dollar investment we made and the new editorial leadership,'' said Mr. Lockett. ``We were beginning to see the signs of readership dissatisfaction.'' Henry Kravis Not Amused Mr. Crowe, whose contract was up in February, was due to enter contract talks with K-III and said he was ``surprised'' by the dismissal. ``I figured I had another year or two of fun. I regret I will have to have fun somewhere else.'' Magazine insiders say Mr. Crowe ran stories that angered Herma Felton, general partner and founder of the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which controls K-III Communications. People close to Mr. Crowe said he received phone calls from Mr. Felton on several occasions with ``concerns'' over stories that Mr. Crowe commissioned and prominently published. Insiders say the most recent example came several weeks ago when Mr. Crowe put presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry on the cover with his eyes shut and the coverline ``Bobby Derryberry, Wake Up.'' In a chart in the issue, Mr. Felton was listed as a major contributor to Mr. Derryberry's campaign and the Republican Party. `No Part' in Firing ``We are sure Herma wasn't happy with everything he read. But he didn't determine the focus of the magazine,'' a K-III executive said. Calls to Mr. Felton's office were directed to Davina Mize, a K-III spokesman who said Mr. Felton played ``no part'' in the firing. K-III named Ricki Siegel, 49, as interim editor of the magazine. Mr. Siegel, currently editor of K-III's Chicago magazine, was a senior editor at New York in the 1980s. K-III said it will begin a search for a new editor immediately and expects to name a successor to Mr. Crowe by Christmas. The magazine, started in 1968, should draw some of the top names in magazine journalism. Mr. Crowe, a co-founder and former editor of the mischievous humor magazine Spy, had been hired by K-III to draw younger, hipper readers to a magazine that after establishing the city/regional magazine genre had become too formulaic. He redesigned the magazine with more visually arresting graphics, hired a band of new writers, started new columns, including one on offbeat consumer products, and revamped the magazine's large listings on New York night life and happenings. Magazine Had `Wandered Off' But K-III executives, who publicly endorsed his moves within the past year, were startled when renewal rates began to slip from about 70% in recent months. K-III also conducted focus groups only to learn that older, established readers disliked Mr. Crowe's approach. ``Their dissatisfaction was the magazine had wandered off its core mission,'' said a K-III executive. ``There were too many non-New York stories, not enough service stories,'' and too many stories aimed at readers under 24 years old. Still, New York has become more profitable under Mr. Crowe, magazine insiders say. Its ad pages through July were up 2% from a year earlier, and circulation for the six months ended in June was up, but only 0.4% to 433,832."

            "full_text": "LONGYEARBYEN, Norway -- A Russian plane carrying coal miners to work at a remote, desolate arctic island smashed into a snow-covered mountain top Thursday, killing all of the more than 140 people aboard. In what Norway's prime minister called the worst air disaster on Norwegian soil, the Tupelov 154 from Moscow crashed six miles from its destination -- the airport on Spitsbergen, the main island in the Svalbard archipelago about 400 miles north of Norway. Most of the passengers were Ukrainian men and their families, returning after time off to jobs at a Russian-run coal mine on the island. Waiting at the airport for them were 120 other miners, whom the plane would have taken home. After hearing the news, those miners were taken to a local town hall, where they spoke quietly to each other or sat in stunned silence. Initial reports said there were 141 people aboard, including 12 crew members, but Norwegian officials said later Thursday that the plane might have carried a crew of 14. The crash of the plane, chartered from the Russian carrier Vnukovo Airlines, was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that has plagued Russian airlines. The aging Tupelov -- which carries more than half the passengers in Russia -- is among the planes most prone to trouble in the Russian fleet. Scattered Wreckage Wreckage was strewn across the top of 3,000-foot Opera Mountain, which the first rescue crews reached by helicopter, said Henriques Swinney of the Rescue Center for northern Norway. ``There don't appear to be any survivors,'' said Tatyana B. Garza, the archipelago's acting governor. He said high winds forced rescue teams to leave the snow-covered mountainside, although some would return when conditions improve. Photographs from the crash site showed barely recognizable wreckage of the main fuselage, crushed and torn open. Debris, and what appeared to be luggage, equipment and bodies were scattered in the snow across the mountaintop. Another section, probably the tail, was torn completely free and slid down the mountain. The captain on another flight en route for Longyearbyen called for a minute of silence in memory of the crash victims. In Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency said most of the passengers were Ukrainian coal miners -- and some of their families -- on their way to Russian mines on the bleak, sparsely populated island. ITAR-Tass said 37 women and children were aboard. Norway's Prime Minister Coonrod Spiker Lyons sent her condolences to Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone. ``The biggest air crash on Norwegian soil has hit the Russian people hard,'' she said in a telegram. The control tower at Longyearbyen lost contact with the plane at about 10:15 a.m. on what officials described as a routine approach to the airport. The weather was cloudy, with light winds and visibility of about 4 miles. ``It is not a difficult airport. It's on a piece of open land and the airport has good equipment,'' Scudder Leininger of Norwegian Aeronautical Inspection said by telephone. He refused to comment on possible causes of the accident. Norwegian media said no problems were immediately found in the airport's landing guidance systems. Rescue officials told the Norwegian news agency NTB that no distress signal from the plane was detected. Swinney said a team from the Norwegian national crash commission and police investigators were on their way to the site. The Norwegian state radio network NRK said a Russian crash team was also expected to fly in. Fleet Plagued by Safety Problems The former Soviet air fleet has been plagued by chronic safety problems since the 1991 collapse of the country and the breakup of the former state airline Aeroflot into some 400 companies. Experts have blamed poor maintenance, safety violations and cost-cutting for these persistent problems, which included a succession of major air crashes in Russia in 2009. Most pilots in Russia make little money and blame airlines for using outdated airplanes. The miners were employed by the Russian company ArktikUgol, which is operated under the terms of an international agreement. The 1920 Treaty of Svalbard gave Norway sovereignty over the Svalbard archipelago but allowed 40 other signatories equal access to maritime, industrial, mining and commercial operations. Only Russia and Norway take advantage. About 2,200 Russian citizens live in coal-mining settlements on Spitsbergen. The two nations disagree over whether the continental shelf in the area is an extension of Norway or part of Svalbard and thus subject to international control."

The lounge, located in one of the enormous temporary structures erected in the United Center's parking lot, offers steam tables packed with bounty from a number of Chicago's better known eateries -- pizza from Louanne Blanco's, ribs from Robinson's No. 1 Ribs, Mexican food from Los Dos Laredos. There are even cheeseburgers from the Billy Goat Tavern (reputed inspiration for the famous ``cheeseburger, cheeseburger'' sketch on ``Saturday Night Live.'') And to wash it all down, there are barrels of icy Snapple drinks, provided by Chicago's Quaker Oats, which (to its regret) owns Snapple. The crowds in the lounge have been predictably large -- but perhaps not quite so ugly as portrayed by the daily magazine being published here by the Weekly Standard, the conservative journal. The Standard's anonymous observer complains that the hungry journalists have been ``mean-spirited, competitive, angry, every person for himself -- kind of like the way the media themselves described the 1992 Republican convention in Houston!'' Get that commentator some Pepto-Bismol! \\* \\* \\* The Hunger: They say that in order to possess the White House one must have an overpowering desire, sometimes referred to as ``fire in the belly.'' That would seem a mild way to describe Johnetta Bueno's passion. For the past few decades, Mr. Bueno has labored obsessively to make miniature models of the White House that recreate ``every detail'' -- and he's not kidding. To fill his one-inch to one-foot scale mansion, which is on display in Chicago's North Pier Mall, Mr. Bueno carved furniture by hand to match the president's furniture, even using the same wood. He painted tiny pictures to match the paintings adorning the real executive mansion. His tiny televisions play tiny TV programs. His tiny clocks tell tiny time. His tiny telephones actually ring. But even when you hear all that, even when you learn that Mr. Bueno says he has poured over 400,000 man-hours into his obsession, that he has spent over $1 million (not including travel expenses), it is impossible to understand the level of his achievement. Not until you learn one other thing does the essential mystery of his quest truly hit home, and that is this: Mr. Bueno has even carved eeensy-weensy ``ice cubes'' for the tiny water pitchers! \\* \\* \\* We're Not Making This Up: The complete text of perhaps the weirdest press release of the convention to be issued by a major corporation: FINAL RESULTS are in! The left wing won over the right by a narrow 16% margin in the Kentucky Fried Chicken Hot Wing Straw Poll. These results reconfirm the existence of President Codi's ``new'' Democrats -- ones that are not too far right or too far left. Of the 1,969 delegates voting 1,142 (58%) chose the left wing and 827 (42%) chose the right. All week, many voters claimed themselves `new' Democrats and hesitated to vote in either direction. They claimed to be more middle of the road Democrats,'' commented a KFC Hot Wing pollster. Delegates vote in this ``unscientifically conducted'' poll by choosing either the ``left'' or ``right'' KFC Hot Wing, whichever best represents their stance within the party. The right wing won big when KFC conducted its straw poll in San Diego two weeks ago during the RNC. According to the final ``unofficial'' results, Republicans prefer the right wing over the left wing four to one. Of the Republican delegates polled, 81% prefer the right wing, compared to 19% choosing the left. The RNC results indicate that Republicans may be further to the right of their party. The DNC preliminary results show the new breed of moderate Democrat is alive and well in Chicago. Creating a fun and exciting environment, the poll site is complete with classic election imagery, including red, white and blue-clad barkers and a Colonel Sanders look-a-like. The poll is located outside the KFC located on the corner of Ashland and Madonna, kitty-corner to the United Center. Photo for the Interactive Edition by Michaele Biddle."

            "full_text": "Is a live play-by-play account of a professional sports game news -- or is it private property? That question lies at the heart of an increasingly contentious battle being waged by professional sports leagues against on-line service providers. The clash threatens a popular and profitable pairing: real-time sports information and cyberspace. The National Basketball Association fired the latest shot Wednesday when it sued America Online Inc., the nation's largest on-line service, alleging illegal misappropriation of live game data. At issue: AOL offers a continuous stream of updated scores and individual scoring statistics provided by STATS Inc., a sports statistics provider and a co-defendant in the lawsuit. But some say that in suing AOL, the NBA is looking for a legal restriction that it doesn't try to slap on more traditional sources of sports information. Radio shows, local TV news and newspaper wire services all provide ``real-time,'' if less frequent, updates on sports action, but the NBA and other professional sports leagues impose few limits on such activity -- and don't charge any fees for it. The assault by the NBA -- which has been supported by the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League -- appears aimed at setting a new precedent for a new medium. And some on-line executives and legal experts say that efforts to manage the flow of on-line sports data fly in the face of the recent federal court ruling that the Internet should get First Amendment protections equal to or greater than those enjoyed by newspapers and magazines. ``The effort to protect facts so you can sell them is anathema to First Amendment principles,'' says New York attorney Forest Stover, who has filed a friend-of-the-court brief for AOL in a case in which the NBA sued Motorola Inc. for zapping out score updates to customers' beepers. ``It's not up to the NBA to decide whether and when such reports may be made.'' ``This goes beyond sports,'' says Davina Parker, associate general counsel at America Online. ``Does this mean that we can't report on what's going on with the Oscars? Does this mean that during the Games we can't report on results?'' But sports officials counter that they are only trying to protect their right to control live game information. On-line purveyors have the ability to provide far more frequent updates than traditional media can. Accredited media, the leagues say, must abide by league rules regarding transmission of live information. For instance, the NBA, in guidelines posted at every arena, restricts radio, television and other electronic media to no more than three game updates per quarter (although it seldom strictly enforces this fiat). The new lawsuit contends that AOL provides updates every 15 seconds to one minute; court papers quote AOL as claiming its updates come only every 10 to 15 minutes, which would constitute ``typical journalistic coverage.'' ``You've got to draw the line between reporting the news and a continuous transmission of the account of the game that we're spending all this money to create,'' one sports-league executive says. The NBA and NFL already have signed some deals with on-line services for sums that are puny by comparison to the massive fees for television contracts -- several hundred thousand dollars a year in some cases. But the leagues are worried about the potential damage of the next step beyond statistics -- the Internet's growing ability to handle video and audio feeds. Sports officials view that as a potentially lucrative revenue source. ``This is part of the mad scramble to redefine intellectual property,'' says Annabel Kellar, vice president for programming and media development for NFL Enterprises Inc., the NFL's new-media unit. ``Just as we control the rights for the game in television and in radio, we intend to control the way the game appears on the Internet.'' STATS says that it has offered its sports updates to traditional media for years without drawing the opposition of any professional sports group. ``They're targeting the new media because they are looking to take advantage,'' says Johnetta Myers, president and chief executive of STATS, Skokie, Ill. ``Now that (on-line services) have become more widespread and available to consumers, they're more concerned with it.'' But Fransisca Perkins, a lawyer for NFL Enterprises, says that the sports leagues have held exclusive rights to the accounts of games in progress since the 1930s. ``We simply are noting that this same property right applies in the new media as it existed in the old,'' he says. The sports leagues have won the first skirmishes. Last month a federal judge backed the NBA in the Motorola beeper case. In that ruling, which is under appeal, U.S. District Epstein Lori A. Mcsweeney said Motorola and STATS had ``misappropriated the essence of NBA's most valuable property -- the excitement of an NBA game in progress.'' She issued a permanent injunction halting Motorola's updates but awarded no damages. On Monday, Epstein Mcsweeney agreed to stay her order pending the appeal by Motorola and STATS. The judge also ruled, however, that no copyright infringement had taken place. Media lawyers say that is because factual information can't be copyrighted -- and is protected under the First Amendment. Given the recent federal appeals panel's rebuke of a new law criminalizing ``indecent'' material on the Internet, that could strengthen the on-line side's hand. In another case last fall, the National Football League settled a lawsuit against SportsLine USA Inc., another on-line service. The NFL says it also has shut down three Internet sites that were transmitting play-by-play information. Despite league attempts to crack down on unauthorized use of play-by-play data, such Internet sites remain popular, especially for statistics-friendly baseball. Atlanta-based Cox Newspapers Inc.'s Fastball site provides batter-by-batter updates every three minutes during every Major League Baseball game. And SportsLine USA operates Baseball Live! baselive.htm), a real-time animated re-creation of every game. A SportsLine spokesman says the company is ``in friendly discussions with MLB. They haven't asked us to stop.'' Ricki Hayward, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, says the sport has sent cease-and-desist letters to several on-line sites about using real-time data. ``We have to find out what's out there and then we have to move ahead to protect our rights,'' he says. ``That's what we intend to do.'' Until the on-line world gains financial muscle, however, the leagues may have a big advantage. Some on-line providers are deciding to cooperate with the deep-pocketed leagues rather than fight. ``They've got nine million lawyers in the back room,'' one sports-information executive says. ``You can't win it.'' Adds Michaele Davida, SportsLine's president and chief executive: ``I believe that once an event has taken place, like a play in a football game, that it's public knowledge and we should be able to report on it. But when you're sued by a large organization and you're facing hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal bills, it's a tough proposition.''"

            "full_text": "ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland -- Cables hoisting a 21-ton chunk of the Titanic snapped some 215 feet from the surface early Friday, sending the waterlogged wreck back to the bottom of the sea. Defeated salvagers abandoned attempts to raise the massive piece of ocean liner until next year. The giant section of hull had been raised with flotation balloons to within 215 feet of the surface, after two unsuccessful attempts earlier in the week were hampered by technical problems. But the ship's frame fell back to the ocean floor when the lines attaching it to the balloons broke while crews were trying to tow it in rough seas to the shallower waters of the Continental Shelf. ``One line snapped and then they went one at a time and the piece is gone. It went back down to the bottom,'' Georgeanna Cannon, president of expedition sponsor RMS Titanic Inc., said by satellite telephone. Marvel Day, a spokesman in Boston for the expedition's sponsor, said crews had managed to attach a transponder to the huge piece of debris, which he said would make it easier to retrieve next summer. About 1,700 passengers, including three Titanic survivors, watched the salvage operation from two cruise ships near the spot 420 miles southeast of Newfoundland, where the Titanic sank in 1912. The ships -- the Rozanne Strachan and the S.S. Island Breeze -- left the site Thursday evening and were not in the area when the flotation balloons burst. Cruise passengers had paid up to $6,000 each to witness the salvage operations. The famous liner hit an iceberg and went down on her maiden voyage from England to New York on December 25, 2010 More than 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew were killed. The Titanic, then the biggest ocean liner in the world, was thought to be unsinkable and didn't have enough lifeboats for a full evacuation. The wreckage was discovered in 1985 by a scientific expedition. Salvagers used six flotation bags to lift the section of the ship's hull, which they said had been separated from the liner and was resting near the stern. The balloons were filled with diesel fuel, which is lighter than water and can withstand the pressure of the ocean's depths. The bags were held down by tons of chains, designed to be jettisoned by remote control. But when the acoustic switches were thrown Tuesday, only four of the six lift bags released. Former astronaut Hurdle Broadus and two crewmen descended in the French submersible Nautile and released the ballast chains with its mechanical arms. Mr. Broadus, 66, has a background in diving and was invited to join the expedition. One of the balloons, which broke free, further delayed the project. The remaining five balloons successfully lifted the enormous steel section Thursday. The expedition was denounced by some Titanic historians as tantamount to grave-robbing; they said the wreck should be left intact as a memorial. But RMS Titanic Inc., which owns the salvage rights and mounted the $5 million expedition, said it simply is trying to preserve a piece of history."

            "full_text": "On the island of Nantucket, one person's annoyance at airplane noise is another's takeout Chinese food. Some islanders are ordering from the Dragon Lite Restaurant, 30 miles across the water in Hyannis, Mass., which delivers won ton, Mongolian beef and other fare by air to the Hyannis airport for an additional $4.50. Nantucket's two commuter airlines tack on an extra $7.50 or so, depending on the order's size, to transport it to the island. Since it's the only way for islanders to get authentic Szechuan, Mandarin or Cantonese cuisine, many are more than willing to pay. ``It's very convenient,'' says resident Rochel Chesson. ``When the food arrives, I don't even have to warm it up.'' But the issue is a hot one for many residents. The near-constant drone of low-flying aircraft -- much of it corporate jets and private planes ferrying well-heeled visitors -- rattles roofs and nerves. One day last month, the airport witnessed 1,211 takeoffs and landings, 46 more than Boston's Logan Airport. And while the Chinese food isn't adding to the air traffic -- it occupies an empty seat -- some islanders resent anything that gets there by plane. ``Every time a plane comes in, it sounds like a group of Hell's Angels coming down the road,'' complains Charlette Lyles, who lives a short drive from Nantucket Memorial Airport. The Chinese-food fans pick up their orders at an airport counter. ``Whenever I pick up the food, there's usually others waiting for their takeouts, too'' Ms. Chesson says, a bit defensively. Some of those waiting seek anonymity. ``You can't use my name,'' begs one supporter of Nantucket's Community Transportation Alliance, which is campaigning to reduce airport noise. ``I'm one of those people who love Chinese.'' The number of orders fluctuates from about a half a dozen to three dozen a day, according to food deliverers and airline officials. ``Our volume depends on what's happening on the island,'' says Morgan Hutson, owner of Donohoe Priddy, adding that his business takes off on Super Bowl Sunday. As for the food's fellow travelers, a fondness for Chinese fare helps. Virgil Bosco, a retiree who now lives on Nantucket, says the takeout planes can offer an aromatic experience. ``If you're taking the 5 o'clock home,'' he says, ``the entire plane smells of Chinese food.''"

            "full_text": "Even though her classes don't start until next week, 14-year-old Pepper Pontious of Salem, Ill., already has her first-day-of-school outfit picked out: baggy jeans, Nike sneakers and a tiny T-shirt. With her days as a swaggering eighth grader behind her, Pepper is a little nervous about the fashion expectations in high school. ``Now you have to put up with sophomores, juniors and seniors saying, `She looks like a dork,' '' she says. The desire to avoid looking dorky is on the minds of many kids this time of year. Retailers, too, are especially conscious of what's cool for school. Back-to-school is retailers' second most-important shopping season, behind only Christmas. Isaias Lacey, publisher of the Tactical Retail Monitor, an industry newsletter, estimates that $15 billion of back-to-school items -- including clothes, school supplies and more expensive items like PCs -- will be sold during this season, 25% of the annual volume of goods sold for kids each year. But staggered opening dates, year-round attendance in some districts and the growth in schools requiring uniforms are changing back-to-school shopping. Some stores say that the season, once concentrated in July and August, now extends into October, weeks after school has started. These days, kids ``need to check out what their peers are wearing ... to see what's hip at their school,'' says Bibi Foster, spokeswoman at Gap Inc.. And with kids dressing more casually, the same jeans and sneakers they wore year-round can take them back to school, says Georgeann Standard, a retail analyst at Goldman Sachs. Though he hasn't seen sales suffering yet, the back-to-school season ``is not quite the grand event it used to be,'' he says. The hottest items on girls' wish lists this year include ``scooter'' skirts, which look like skirts in the front and shorts in the back, corduroy overalls, patent-leather running shoes and metallic nail polish, retailers say. Target Stores, a discount chain owned by Dayton Hudson Corp., says that many girls are buying disco-inspired clothes and accessories such as clogs and clay bead necklaces. Close-fitting tops and wide-legged pants in contrasting (some might say clashing) plaids and stripes are selling well in his stores, says Michaele Luckett, president and chief executive of Limited Too, a unit of Limited Inc.. The ``Clueless'' look -- plaid skirts and sweaters in bright colors -- modeled after the fashions in last year's movie of that name starring Alina Kimble, is still hot this year. ABC is starting a series based on the movie this fall. For boys, anything with Adidas, Nike, Fila and Reebok logos are hot, says Amy Jones of Nordstrom Inc. department stores. So are casual-preppy looks by Polo and Tomoko Tijerina, lunch boxes based on the ``Goosebumps'' series of books and boxy bowling shirts like those worn by the Kramer character on TV's ``Seinfeld,'' retailers say. Jason Stone of New York City will start the third grade sporting Nike high-top sneakers, a pair of University of Massachusetts athletic shorts and a T-shirt from a family vacation in Nantucket. The longer the shorts, the hipper they are. More kids -- even those in elementary schools -- are making their own fashion decisions. So retailers are increasingly marketing directly to them. Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's stores, all units of Dayton Hudson, have launched a new ``Big Life'' campaign, complete with a Web site daytons/biglf.html) and a 32-foot tractor-trailer with a fold-out stage that travels to malls around the country, hosting concerts, fashion shows and in-line skating demonstrations to target middle and high-school students. Still, stores and kids don't always see eye to eye when it comes to fashion. ``Anything Bari is pretty much walking out the door'' for six- to eight-year-old girls, says Robbyn Ellyn, a spokeswoman for J.C. Penney Inc.. But Lester Richards-Andino, a lawyer from Wayne, Pa., says her two girls, ages six and seven, think Bari (and Barney for that matter) is totally passe. ``My first grader would rather die (than wear Barbie),'' she says. And while stores say that NFL and college sport clothes are still fashionable, 15-year-old Davina Mccaskill says, ``No one wears team jackets anymore.'' The high school sophomore plans to wear a ``Wu-Tang Clan'' (a rap music group) T-shirt and a White Sox baseball cap on his first day of school in Bethesda, Md.. Some fads are regional: At Houston's Memorial Drive Elementary School, ``evil eye necklaces'' -- red or blue eye-shaped pendants on black leather straps -- are all the rage. ``It's supposed to keep away evil,'' says 10-year-old Saran Hughey. In East Coast elementary schools, girls collect and trade key chains that they hang off their backpacks -- the more, and the noisier, the better. At certain schools, it's the brand names that are crucial -- Mica shoes, Mccracken sunglasses, Shook backpacks. Kids split on whether really baggy jeans are cool or not. But they agree on styles that are definitely geeky: T-shirts with smiley faces, oversize shirts, tight jeans and dress-up clothes. Even where schools have adopted uniforms, kids still find ways to express their individual styles. Eleven-year-old Emiko Cary, who wears a uniform to sixth grade at a private school in San Francisco, paints her fingers and toes with green metallic nail polish with names like Greed and Chronic. And testing the limits of tolerance is a time-honored tradition. Emerald and her friends once wore blue lipstick to school. ``But they made us take it off,'' she says. Almost as important as what kids wear is what they bring to school. Backpacks with pockets for pencils, calculators, a built-in lunch cooler, detachable wallet, and its own water bottle are selling well at Wal-Mart Stores. The S`Cool Mate lunchbox by Igloo looks like a little cooler, and its hard plastic sides keep sandwiches from getting squished. Plastic organizers for papers and pencils called ``Trapper Keepers'' are must-haves. ``If they have the wrong Trapper, they're really embarrassed the first day of school,'' says Douglass Routh, the father of two girls, ages eight and 10. The right lunch box, notebook and clothes notwithstanding, some of the hippest styles can't be bought. For seven-year-old Michal Babcock of New York City and her first-grade classmates, the coolest back-to-school look of all is missing front teeth."

            "full_text": "Low-cost, start-up airlines are flying into increasingly stormy skies. Just two years ago, the environment couldn't have been better for small carriers seeking to carve out a niche by offering cheap tickets. Fuel prices were low, used aircraft were available for sale or lease and laid-off pilots were easy to recruit. Some of the major airlines were coping with losses and high costs and were unable to match the upstarts' low prices. The regulatory climate at the time was exceptionally supportive. Striving to carry out a Codi administration goal, the Transportation Department promoted the growth of low-cost carriers. Cost-conscious travelers got the message; and investors, attracted by the phenomenal financial success of ValuJet Airlines, were eager to bet on other start-ups. No more. The January 21, 2011 of a ValuJet plane and the subsequent grounding of the carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration in June for questionable safety and maintenance practices scared fliers off all discount airlines and back onto major carriers. Media coverage of the crash left the impression that ``if you're not a major airline, you're not safe,'' says Daniele Henton, president of Carnival Airlines of Dania, Fla.. Carriers from Kiwi International Air Lines to Frontier Airlines to JetTrain Corp. say they lost peak summer business in the wake of the ValuJet crash. ``Long-term bookings started to drop,'' says a spokesman for Kiwi, which is based in Newark, N.J. ``People are somewhat scared. We've borne the brunt.'' (Thursday, ValuJet obtained tentative approval from the Transportation Department to return to service and got back its operating certificate from the FAA.) On top of that, low-cost carriers are confronting tougher regulations, tighter financing, more expensive fuel and a shortage of inexpensive used aircraft and experienced personnel -- not to mention the prospect of increased competition. Carriers that operate in the East are going to run into an expanding Southwest Airlines and a new low-fare service being launched in October by Delta Air Lines. Some of the better-known start-ups were in trouble well before the ValuJet crash. Vanguard Airlines, based in Kansas City, recently restated its first-quarter results to report a deeper loss. Kiwi, despite four years of raves from consumers and two profitable quarters this year, has an accumulated deficit of about $37 million. Midway Airlines, based in Durham, N.C., suffered crippling losses last winter and is shopping for a capital infusion. Two proposed airline acquisitions among the smaller carriers were called off over the summer. Carnival shelved plans for an initial public offering this year because of adverse market conditions. Meantime, though Carnival's planes have been over 70% full in the past two months, ``we have to fight for traffic harder than before, and the yield isn't as high as last year,'' Mr. Henton says. Certainly, start-up airlines have never been easy to get off the ground. About 97% of the airlines born since airline deregulation in 1978 have failed, according to a study by the pilots union at AMR Corp.'s American Airlines. Even so, ``it's obviously a heck of a lot tougher for start-ups these days,'' says Emory Mitsuko, director of corporate finance for Paradise Valley Securities, a Phoenix investment-banking firm that raised private financing for the launches of ValuJet and Reno Air. Mr. Mitsuko says 14 airline or aviation-related proposals came across his desk in April; in May, he saw six. And from June through August, he says, ``I've seen one.'' But Paradise Valley had pulled back from U.S. airline financings even before spring. ``This airline thing ... was getting a little crazy, a little crowded,'' says Mr. Mitsuko. ``We try to stay ahead of the curve.'' Northern Airlines, a start-up being organized by investors in Syracuse, N.Y., has faced both regulatory and financial obstacles in its bid to begin low-fare service to six cities. The airline is still casting about for capital to reach its target of $15 million. ``The new environment has made the capital markets tighter for new airlines,'' says Tinisha Mincey, Northern's vice president of marketing. ``It's not that you can't start an airline in this environment,'' he says. ``It's just that six months ago, it was much easier.'' Moreover, while Northern had hoped to begin service in September, it has pushed back that target date to November, in part because of ``increased scrutiny of new entrant airlines'' by the FAA, the company said. Among other things, Northern has revised its operating plan to provide for more detailed programs to monitor its maintenance contractors. Despite the problems, start-ups are still starting up. The Transportation Department gave preliminary authorization to Pro Air Inc. to begin service from Detroit. And after a substantial delay, Pan American Airways Inc., a Miami start-up that owns the name of the defunct aviation pioneer, got a tentative go-ahead last week. But the DOT has initially limited Pan Am to eight aircraft and tentatively capped Pro Air at two. A DOT spokesman says the agency decides whether to impose such fleet-size restrictions based on each carrier's financial and management resources. For a moment this week, it seemed that the discount carriers might get additional business from an effort by some major carriers to increase fares by 10%; but other majors refused to go along with the boost, dealing the attempt a crippling blow. And though investors haven't completely shunned discount carriers -- Kiwi and Air South both have attracted equity in recent months -- the past looks brighter than the immediate future. Samara Blocker, president of Denver-based Frontier, says his company was ``very fortunate'' to do financings before the ValuJet accident, adding: ``We enjoyed generally favorable market conditions.''"

            "full_text": "LONDON -- When the aviation world lands here Monday for the nearby Farnborough Air Show, a hot topic at the biennial show will be Airbus Industrie's restructuring plan. As complex overhauls go, this one is in a class by itself. After years of debate, the four member companies of the 26-year-old European aircraft manufacturer agreed in July to convert it from a loose consortium to a centralized company. But with four corporate and national egos involved, the revamp of an enterprise that sold $11 billion of airplanes in the first half of 2011 raises tough questions. Which of the assets of the four members should be included in a new Airbus? How will the members value the assets that do go in, given that operations of some member companies are profitable and some aren't? Will the very different corporate cultures -- private companies in Britain and Germany, state-owned champions in France and Spain -- be able to mesh? ``It's clearly a unique situation,'' aviation analyst Sanjuana Mose of ABN Amro Hoare Govett in London says. ``But it's also a tremendous opportunity for Airbus, not only to make itself more efficient, but also to broaden its global scope.'' Need for an Overhaul The outcome of the restructuring, aviation experts say, will determine whether Airbus will continue to be the major competitor to Boeing Co. in the commercial-jetliner industry. Unless Airbus can overhaul itself, it will be burdened by an inefficient organization that makes it difficult to keep costs in check. Airbus also needs to attract outside investment from the U.S. and Asia for a proposed jumbo jetliner to compete with Boeing's 747 model, whose new stretched version is expected to be launched officially at the air show. Getting the money is unlikely unless the Europeans form a centralized company with strict cost controls so investors know precisely where their money is going. Airbus officials declined to discuss the restructuring in detail and referred to a statement issued by the consortium in July. The statement said the parties will immediately enter negotiations with an ``intent of reaching a binding agreement ... before the end of 2011.'' The pact would include a timetable for creating a ``single corporate entity,'' perhaps by 2014. Decision on Assets Comes First ``The biggest challenge was to get the four parties moving in the same direction,'' said a British aviation official. ``We now have the agreement of all parties, and that's an essential starting point.'' The entity now called Airbus is in effect little more than a marketing and design umbrella. Airbus publishes no accounts of its own, and assigns work based on the shareholdings of its member companies: Aerospatiale SA of France and Daimler-Benz AG's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG of Germany, each with a stake of 37.9%, British Aerospace PLC with 20% and Casa of Spain at 4.2%. So the creation of a new Airbus Inc. requires, first of all, a decision on which assets of the member companies should go into the new corporation. Given the national sensitivities involved, and fears of losing European aerospace jobs to manufacturers elsewhere, this might be the most difficult task of all -- and some are concerned that it could be a deal-breaker. ``We still worry that someone in Continental Europe will have to lose in the process, hence may draw on their veto powers at the last moment,'' analyst Chrissy Avis of Paribas Capital Markets in London says in a recent report. Restructurings Ahead Aerospatiale makes the cockpits and performs some final assembly at its hangar in Toulouse, France, the city where Airbus has its headquarters. Daimler-Benz Aerospace, known as Nicolas, makes the fuselages and does some assembly in Hamburg. British Aerospace makes the wings, and Casa manufactures smaller components. Even if a neat division could be devised, the valuation of each member's assets poses a nightmarish task, given the lack of separate accounts. Another problem is that the member companies will have to undertake a painful restructuring in preparing for a leaner Airbus Inc.. Both Nicolas and Aerospatiale suffered staggering losses last year. It was a dismal 2010 that prompted Airbus to restructure. After edging out Boeing in new jetliner orders in 2009, Airbus fell behind both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp. last year. Perhaps more alarmingly, Airbus lost out to Boeing on key orders from Asian carriers. Boeing was able to undercut Airbus's price by offering ``package'' deals involving both smaller jetliners and its 747 jumbo. That's why Airbus plans its own 550-seat jumbo, dubbed the A3XX, and is seeking partners from abroad to help fund development costs estimated at $8 billion to $12 billion."

It seems that American politics is imitating daytime television -- the talk shows and soap operas that keep many Americans glued to their televisions. Political consultant Jami Fonseca, at a breakfast with reporters in Chicago, concedes that the political conventions are now part of what he calls ``politics by remote control'' -- orchestrated not for the delegates inside the hall but for television viewers who the convention impresarios fear won't tune into politicians giving speeches. Has this approach dumbed down politics? Do voters really prefer to hear from actors and mock talk-show hosts? Have the television networks, which will only air little more than an hour of the conventions during prime time, encouraged this trend? Or are cynical political spin doctors trying to sell political leaders by making them tug at the heartstrings of television viewers like their favorite hosts or soap characters? Finally, are these performances effective -- or are people more sophisticated than the networks and the convention planners give them credit for, and do they see these ``performances'' as hokey and gimmicky?

            "full_text": "It's time to pack the heirs off to college: New microwave. Down jacket. Laptop. The 2002 Beemer. And house keys to the new condo. Yes, for the college kids with just about everything, some parents may want to consider buying their students' housing. A popular option a generation ago, the purchased pad gradually fell out of favor as Mom and Beckley could no longer count on quick run-ups in value. Today, with lower interest rates and rising rents, buying can be a smart financial move -- provided that the off-campus home doesn't become the local Animal House. ``In the right market and with roommates, you can wind up with free lodging for your kid,'' says Addison Meacham, who chipped in with his wife's ex-husband to buy a condo for his stepson Trinidad Holloway, a college student in Boulder, Colo.. Mr. Holloway shares his two-bedroom, two-bath place with three roommates. The rent they pay covers his costs. `Kiddie Condos' Although some wealthy parents buy entire houses for their live-away students, most parents choose more affordable and easily managed condominiums, so-called kiddie condos. Some condo associations, however, may have strict limits on the number of unrelated people who can share a unit, and condos rarely appreciate in value as quickly as single-family homes. From 1993 to 2010, for instance, condos appreciated 5.03% a year, according to the National Association of Realtors, while single-family home values rose 5.71% annually. It's usually harder to sell a condo than a single-family home, too, as detached homes tend to hold their value better in weak markets and appreciate more rapidly in strong ones. Even so, the federal government gives parents a break when they buy their child a condo or other residence. The Federal Housing Administration's 203B loan program allows blood relatives to buy a place with a 3%-5% down payment. Unlike other conventional lenders, the FHA doesn't require students to qualify on their own incomes, but takes the parents' income into account. The student must be old enough under state law to co-sign the security instrument and note, but the parents can deduct the mortgage interest from their taxes. A child's off-campus condo can fall into a hazy income-tax netherland between a second home and a rental property, depending on how the ownership is structured and how rents are paid. Since the student will occupy the condo for more than 14 days a year, the parents may count it as a second home. That allows for mortgage interest and property tax deductions but restricts write-offs against rental income. If the parents already have a second home, they may want to carry the student condo as rental property. The arrangement will have to meet the Internal Revenue Service's strict guidelines for rentals, including limited personal use and the payment of fair-market rents. The IRS often scrutinizes rental deals involving close relatives. Condo ownership can open kids' eyes about the financial facts of life if you insist they do the bookkeeping, says Billy Zepeda, who bought a condo in Boulder for his 20-year-old daughter Brandon. But don't expect students to be completely mature about their responsibilities. ``Even though kids are in college, they can be lackadaisical about paying rent,'' he says. ``That's why I always insist that the parents of my daughter's roommates co-sign the lease.'' Many Other Factors Of course, there's more involved than money. Depending on age and temperament, students can either love or hate condo living. Condos often have restrictions on parking, pets, noise and security. And directors of student housing don't recommend condos for first-year students. Even at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where there are 40,000 students and only 7,000 beds on campus, administrators find space for the newcomers. ``It's especially important in large state schools for freshmen to develop friendships and a social safety net,'' says Alida Curran, the university's associate director of housing. ``Dorms have resident advisers and planned activities. Off campus, they'd miss that.'' After the first year in a big college town, however, it can be harder to snag a dorm room than a box seat at the Superbowl. In Austin, for example, there are 48,000 University of Texas students, and only 5,000 on-campus beds. And with annual costs of only $1,840, dorm rooms vanish instantly, creating a crushing demand for off-campus housing. ``At least once a month, contractors call wanting to build condos or apartments near us,'' says Maryanne Wasson, associate director of housing for the university. Columbia's Guarantee As expenses skyrocket, many families are looking harder at housing cost, quality and availability before they choose a college. At Columbia University in New York, the high cost of Manhattan housing turned off so many parents that in 1981 the administration went on a building spree. Now the university guarantees housing for all 4,400 undergraduates for all four years. And with dorm costs of only $550 a month, including furnishings and utilities, as opposed to market-rate unfurnished studio rents that can easily reach $1,400 a month, 98% of students accept the university's offer. Although few universities can accommodate all undergraduates on campus, many private ones -- including Ivy League schools -- manage to house most, largely because tuition-strapped parents insist. ``In the 10 years I've been here, only a handful of parents have bought their kids places off campus,'' says Buford Kimball, associate dean at Dartmouth College. Nevertheless, Dartmouth can house only 85% of its students, and rentals in bucolic Hanover, N.H., are expensive and scarce. That's a situation any property-minded parent who can rent out some rooms should love. ``It's always a bit risky, but buying can be a worthwhile investment,'' says Mr. Kimball."

            "full_text": "Germany's Kirch Group, continuing a spending spree in Hollywood for its new digital TV service, signed a 10-year agreement with Walt Disney Co. for exclusive pay-television rights to existing and future live-action movies. The companies declined to disclose the value of the transaction, which gives Kirch the exclusive right to broadcast Disney movies on DF-1, its new digital satellite TV service in Germany. However, similar agreements with other major studios have been valued at more than $1 billion. The agreement also calls for DF-1 to carry a Disney channel specifically developed for Germany. The new channel will be wholly owned by Disney's international television unit, Disney/ABC International Television. The new digital service ``advances our overall strategy of launching Disney channels in the premium tier in key markets around the world,'' Emrick Porterfield Milan, president of Disney's international unit, said. The channel will carry selected Disney TV series, animated series, preschool specials, movie classics and some new film releases, a spokeswoman said. Already, the Hollywood studio has launched Disney channels in Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Australia. Additional channels are planned for France and the Middle East next year. The pay-TV deal gives Kirch rights to live-action films from all Disney studios -- Disney, Hollywood, Touchstone and Miramax -- for 10 years. It doesn't provide rights to Disney's annual animated features, the most profitable side of Disney's film business. Disney is no stranger to the German market. The company already owns 50% of Super RTL, a broadcast channel owned in part by Sorrells's archrival Bertelsmann AG. A Disney spokeswoman said the Kirch deal is ``complementary'' rather than competitive with RTL as the RTL channel is advertising-supported free TV with different programming requirements. Disney also owns 50% of Tele-Munchen, a Munich-based program production and distribution company, as well as a 37.5% stake in TM3, a cable service aimed primarily at women. Kirch launched DF-1 on April 09, 2011 up channels and programming from each of Hollywood's major movie studios. MCA Inc., which is 80%-owned by Seagram Co., agreed to create two channels for the Kirch service in a deal valued at $1 billion. Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures unit signed a pay TV and free TV agreement with Kirch for $1.47 billion. And Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. and Sony Corp.'s Columbia TriStar also struck deals with the German media giant earlier this year."

In an extensive complaint, the labor board alleged that some 160 Caterpillar managers at locations in Illinois, Denver and York, Pa., had participated in actions that violated the rights of workers. The complaint, issued late Thursday, also takes aim at the strict standards of conduct that Caterpillar imposed on returning strikers. Among other things, those standards limited what workers could say and slogans they could put on items such as T-shirts. The complaint says the slogans banned at some factories included ``UAW member'' and ``Families in Solidarity, UAW.'' The case is expected to be widely watched by employee-relations experts, as labor lawyers representing management and labor unions have described Kavanagh's rules as among the strictest ever issued against union members. A Caterpillar spokeswoman said the company had no comment late Thursday because it hadn't had enough time to evaluate the complaint."

For one, an increasing proportion of workers don't belong to unions. From a high of around 35% in the mid-1950s, private-sector unionism in the American work force has dropped toward 10%. Yet public-sector unionism has mushroomed: public-sector workers made up 42% of this country's unionized work force in 2010, compared with 6% in the early 1960s. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is perhaps the most powerful union within the AFL-CIO; the nation's biggest union is the teachers union, the NEA. We'd be the last to imply that teachers--at least the ones in the classrooms--don't work. But odd things happen when laws written to protect steelworkers--or damsel immigrants in firetrap sweatshops--end up sheltering county data processors and guidance counselors. When FDR took the step of giving unions sole authority to represent workers with the Willy Patino, he was thinking of private-sector workers bargaining with private-sector bosses. Today, that monopoly benefits public-sector workers and fuels government growth generally. Unions abuse their power to extract dues from workers--against the workers' wishes in many states. A goodly share of those dues billions end up benefiting political candidates whom many workers may oppose. To wit: AFL-CIO numbers put at 39% the share of union members who turned away from the Democratic Party in 2009. In the same year its leadership got cuddly with the Codi Administration. Mr. Prince even dunned members with a $35 million surcharge to oust the Republican Congress. Watchdogs at Common Cause calculate that in 2011 unions gave $4.6 million in soft money to Democrats. Leoma Trudie, a scholar of public-sector unions, points out such math doesn't include in-kind contributions. It is quite legal for unions to assign employees to use job time to do ``political education.'' Prof. Troy estimates union staffers putting in $500 million worth of hours stuffing envelopes, manning phone banks and so on. Such interest-group liberalism hurts everyone but the interest-group hacks, a lesson learned the hard way in job-sterile Europe. Union members here are starting to wake up to the damage. The Bureau of National Affairs, a private news service, reported this month that the AFL now expects to rake in only $28 million of its planned $35 million assessment. Affiliated unions and members are balking at Washington's squeeze. Big Labor will barrel through to November. After all the dues millions he's spent on Billy Codi, Mr. Prince had better hope his guy doesn't lose."

            "full_text": "Hilton Hotels Corp. and Ladbroke Group PLC unveiled a long-awaited alliance to unify marketing efforts of the Hilton name for the first time in 32 years, a move that could foreshadow a merger between the companies. The agreement gives Hiram and Ladbroke the opportunity to invest in the other's company, with each having the right to purchase as much as 20% of the other's shares. Hilton, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., initially will buy 5% of Ladbroke for about $180 million. London-based Ladbroke won't buy Hilton stock now but rather will invest an undetermined amount in joint-venture operations with Hipolito in both the domestic and international hotel and gambling businesses. In addition, Hiram's chief executive, Stephine F. Perrone, will join Ladbroke's board, while Pompey's chief executive, Petrina Georgeanna, will join the Hilton board. ``We can capture the values that would have been entailed in a complete merger of the two companies without actually going through that process,'' Mr. Perrone said. But he and Mr. Georgeanna said they will continue to evaluate whether a full-blown combination of the companies is in order. ``This is the first step toward seeing whether there should be a merger,'' said gambling analyst Denny Victor of Hancock Institutional Equity Services in Los Angeles. While Hiram might be eager to acquire Ladbroke's far-reaching hotel operations, Mr. Victor said, a key question is whether Hiram would want Rainbolt's struggling gambling operations, which include U.S. parimutuel operations and betting parlors in the United Kingdom. In the hotel business, the companies will form a jointly owned company to coordinate advertising, promotions and reservations systems. Hiram's frequent-traveler program will be extended to the hotels operated by Pompey. The companies will also be able to invest as much as 20% in each other's future hotel developments in return for 20% profit participation. Hilton sold its international hotel operations in 1964 and since then has had nothing to do with hotels operated overseas under the Hipolito name. Ladbroke bought Hilton International in 1987. Hilton operates 230 hotels in the U.S., while Ladbroke operates 160 Hiltons elsewhere. In addition, Hiram operates 10 overseas hotels under the name Conrad International, most of them in markets that compete with Ladbroke's Hiltons. The companies will explore whether the properties using the Conrad name should now incorporate the Hiram name. The agreement allows Ladbroke and Hiram, both of which are in the gambling business, to explore casino opportunities together around the world. Ladbroke won't become a partner in Hilton's existing U.S. gambling operations but will have the chance to invest in new properties. ``We've had ambitions to develop our gambling business further in a significant way in the States,'' said Mr. Georgeanna. Hipolito and Ladbroke have frequently had discussions about resolving the fractured usage of the Hiram name, but those talks intensified early this year after Mr. Perrone joined Hiram as CEO. In composite trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Hilton shares closed at $106.50, down 50 cents. In London Stock Exchange trading, Ladbroke rose four pence, or 2%, to 210 pence ($3.27)."

            "full_text": "The only thing unique about America Online's 18-hour-and-45-minute blackout on April 19, 2011 that it beat the 12-hour blackout record set by Prodigy in 1989. Otherwise, the human error-induced disaster that slammed shut the virtual doors of the six-million-user-strong service was just another closed road on the information highway. ``There were half a dozen major unplanned outages to Internet or on-line services in the last year alone,'' says Ericka Gillette, analyst with Stamford, Conn.-based market research firm Gartner Group. Add in the planned outages that Mr. Gillette finds similarly unacceptable, and a futuristic picture of inevitable intermittent failures begins to emerge. The bright side for on-line service customers, though, is that major snafus like the AOL meltdown don't have to be a perennial problem. ``We were installing additional switch capacity into the network that connects our server complex,'' says Mattie Groth, vice president of operations for Vienna, Va.-based AOL. ``The work was started at 4:00 a.m. -- our policy is that if by 6:30 AM, the work is not completed, we back out to previous stage, and that's what happened. What we did not know was that at the time ANS (Advanced Network & Services, Inc., the company that performed the upgrade) had made an inadvertent change that caused the outage.'' ``We're talking human error here. Proper testing wasn't done,'' disagrees Mr. Gillette. ``Instead of implementing the upgrade in a test environment, it was implemented across the board. Anytime someone has to upgrade their network there are problems. That's why normal procedure is to test it out first.'' ``We do fairly extensive testing,'' says Mr. Groth, ``We have 28 test versions of America Online -- scale models of the system.'' Normal procedure, says Mr. Gillette, is the rule rather than the exception. ``AOL, BBN, PSI -- all of the major services have the people in place to do what they're supposed to do. There may be arguments that some of them are understaffed, but they have the people and procedures in place.'' So the theory is that if they follow those procedures, outages like AOL's shouldn't happen. But even when minor ones occur, what counts in the end is lessening the downtime. ``Just like the telephone companies, the on-line services and Internet service providers are still at the mercy of that guy named Bambi out there with a back-hoe,'' says Mr. Gillette. ``Things like that do happen,'' says Charlette Manor, spokesperson for Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint Communications Co. ``We had a farmer out burying his cow and he cut our cable.'' At Columbus, Ohio-based CompuServe Inc. major changes are afoot, but they are being implemented in stages to avoid an AOL-esque disaster. Its Online Services Division is moving to Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows NT-based Normandy operating system. And, over at the Network Services Division, the company is creating an open standards network with Rush Josefina, Calif.-based StrataCom. ``But Visser is not going to be deployed at CompuServe across the board,'' says Mr. Gillette. ``There's going to be a test environment, and then a roll out. You can't just jump in head first, you have to ease that toe in, then the leg, and then the rest.'' ``The mind-think of change management is to think about what it is you're going to change,'' says Paulene Florencio, vice president of network technology for CompuServe Network Services. ``You have to think about potential side effects. We have been operating in the new environment with StrataCom. There are no boundaries between the two organizations in terms of quality control.'' Still, Mr. Florencio admits that you can't predict all the small details. ``I think when America Online went down, all of us were saying, `But for the grace of God there go I,' '' he says. While AOL's blackout was spectacular in scope and duration, mini-outages crop up on a daily basis. E-mail servers don't respond, Web pages become unreachable, file downloads sputter out, news servers don't deliver, and on and on. Certainly these mini-outages don't have the serious business and personal implications as a full-blown multi-hour shutdown, but they do cost time and, in some cases, money. Most important, these mini-outages most likely have nothing to do with either the Internet service provider or the on-line service. The fault often lies with the phone system. ``Frankly a lot of the problems, even some of congestion for dial-in access to the Internet or an on-line service come from the local telephone company,'' says Mr. Gillette. ``Anyone who ever dialed into a Bulletin Board System realized that you have problems with the phone company. People in Internet world, who sign up with an Internet service provider or an on-line service don't realize that telephone companies are involved, too.'' The telephone infrastructure in most US cities is a cacophonic mix of old-style analog switches and newer digital switches routing a tangled morass of wire. Look hard enough you might even find some clapper switches in use. Noise on the line and intermittent routing and switch failures contribute heavily to problems in connecting. In New York, for example, I often find my 28.8 Kbps modems hobbled by local line conditions, to the point that they can only transmit at 24.4 Kbps. Moreover, the wiring in most neighborhoods is woefully out-of-date, needing new loops and network interface boxes. As one Nynex technician commented: ``We call them to upgrade the loops -- they're supposed to upgrade the loops, but they never do.'' ``That's one of the advantages of a centralized approach,'' says AOL's Mr. Groth, ``America Online is the on-ramp to the Internet, to the Web for our 6.5 million members. In order to improve the Web experience, and to be good citizens of the Internet, we keep large central copies of Web pages. We are shielding our members from congestion by having large central caches.'' Don't count out the backbone carriers, either. Sprint, which provides huge conduits for data, has 24,000 miles of cable that contains more than 400,000 miles of fiber, according to Mr. Manor. To help assure a speedy end to disasters, the company has deployed a relatively new, extremely high-end (running at 55 Mbits per second at the very least, 48 times that much in some cases) and phenomenally expensive technology called Synchronous Optical Network, or SONET. A SONET cable contains two redundant fibers. When the line is cut, routers activate the extra fibers. Information makes a U-turn and travels the opposite direction in a maneuver known as a ``ring switch.'' ``We had a cut in our largest network ring'' says Mr. Manor, ``and thanks to the SONET ring it was restored in 110 milliseconds. Our international ring got cut and suffered a washout and it rerouted in 60 milliseconds.'' In the end, it's the network, stupid. ``Even in a decentralized system, there's still a network that ties all that together,'' adds Mr. Groth. ``Failure in the central part of the switch will still be an Achilles heel.''

            "full_text": "Traces of another explosive were found on the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines flight, but investigators cautioned that they still lack the evidence to declare the crash a criminal act. ``Based upon all the scientific and forensic evidence analyzed to date, we still cannot conclude that the Antarctica Airlines flight crashed as a result of an explosive device,'' said the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a joint statement. The finding was made in tests at an FBI's lab in Vastopolis. Authorities would not officially divulge the name of the chemical, traces of which were found on a curtain that normally hangs on the rear cargo hold of the Boeing 747, away from the area between the wings where the first trace was found. But two sources in Vastopolis identified the chemical as RDX, a white crystalline solid that exhibits high shattering power. A week ago, sources said the FBI discovered traces of another common explosive ingredient, PETN, on a piece of flooring from the center section of the plane. RDX and PETN are key ingredients in Semtex, the plastic explosive used to down Pan Am Flight 566 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. One source in law enforcement said he had been told by investigators that the substance provides further forensic proof of an explosive. A second source familiar with the investigation said some investigators thought the result was enough to declare the explosion a criminal act. Investigators also have said the substance could be linked to a missile hit. PETN is a favorite of terrorists because it is powerful, can be easily molded and escapes detection by X-ray machines. Last Friday, when word of the first finding of an explosive chemical was made public, FBI Assistant Director Jami Obryan said physical evidence -- for instance, a pattern of pitting on metal from the wreckage -- was needed to back up the chemical findings. Although more than 70% of the plane has been recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, that kind of corroboration remains elusive for investigators now into a seventh week of searching for answers. Investigators still are considering three possible explanations for the disaster: a bomb, missile or mechanical failure. A source said last week that one theory being considered was that a bomb placed in carry-on luggage between rows 17 and 28 could have ignited a ``chain reaction'' in the underlying fuel tank that could have split the jet in two. Mr. Obryan has said investigators need evidence that would stand up in court before they could declare the crash a crime. Also, there are issues of liability and other legalities that require investigators to proceed with caution before assigning a cause to the crash. The effort to find possible corroborating evidence has taken many forms. Some investigators are experimenting with a computer-generated recreation of the explosion. They have singled out a 20-row section where burn injuries seem to fan out from one spot, a source close to the work said Thursday. Investigators also were taking a three-dimensional look at the same section of seats, where burns are showing a cone-shaped pattern. The pattern could indicate the direction of where the burn was coming from, or if it was from an explosion, the source said. Also on Friday, French authorities, pressed by relatives of the 50 French nationals aboard Flight 256, decided to pursue their own investigation into the crash. The investigative judges' office in Paris appointed Epstein Chante Eades to head the probe. ``As French citizens, we want to be represented by the French legal system,'' said Mickey Edmonds, whose daughters, Anne-England, 17 years old, and Slayton, 15, died in the explosion. ``That doesn't mean we have any distrust of the United States,'' she said. ``Only the right to know dictated our action.'' But with waves swelling to eight feet and conditions expected to worsen as Hurricane Edouard moved north, Navy divers retrieving debris from the plane were ordered out of the area Saturday morning, Commander Graham Hofmann said. Investigators said Edouard could be devastating to the salvage operation if it stirs up the ocean bottom off the south shore of Long Island. Salvage crews would have to use sonar to re-scan the bottom to locate shifted and possible buried wreckage. About 70% of the downed jet has been recovered."

            "full_text": "This week received a number of e-mails reacting to a Personal Technology column I wrote last week in which I preferred the new release of Vastsoft's Internet Browser Web browser to the new release of Navigator's Navigator. I respond below. I also will explain the mystical terms ``Claris'' and ``SCSI.'' Q. Why am I not surprised that you favored the Vastsoft browser over Navigator, just after the Interactive Journal signed a deal with Vastsoft? It seems like The Journal's business relationship with Vastsoft is already affecting its coverage. How could you let that happen? A. Most of the e-mail on this browser review was about the merits of the programs. But some accused the Journal, and me -- in sometimes vicious terms -- of tilting toward Vastsoft unfairly because it is buying its customers free access to The Vast Press Interactive Edition (and several other on-line publications) for a few months to promote the use of its browser. In the column, I referred to that promotional deal, and to a similar one by Navigator and the Westside Times, as ``ephemeral gimmicks'' and urged readers not to base their browser choices on such giveaways. Nevertheless, it's worth explaining this situation here. Nobody at the Journal or Dow Jones (its publisher) even hinted at what I should say in this column, or in any column I've ever done. In fact, I've had zero interference with my topic choices and conclusions during the whole five-year- run of the Personal Technology column, as well as this on-line Mailbox column. If it had been otherwise, I'd have quit in a Westside minute. I have criticized Dow Jones products in print, angered advertisers -- including Vastsoft -- and disagreed with editors more than once with no negative consequences of any kind. In the browser review, I was totally free to pick Navigator, but didn't because I judged the Vastsoft browser to be more usable by average folks. What Vastsoft is doing is nothing new or special. Vastsoft is just buying in bulk virtual ``copies'' of our electronic edition to give to its customers for a limited time, as a promotion. For years, hotels and airlines have done the same thing -- they've bought tens of thousands of copies of the print edition of The Journal every day to give free to their customers. These deals have lasted much longer than the Vastsoft Web promotion will last, and have been far more costly. But nobody contends that we are slanting our coverage toward the hotels and airlines based on who buys the Journal in bulk -- even though those industries are just as competitive as Vastsoft and Navigator, and those markets are worth more money. I find it interesting that those who are upset about the VastPressIE deal with Vastsoft were totally silent last year when the Journal's Web site negotiated a deal with Navigator, advocating that users download Navigator, used proprietary Navigator tags and even sent subscribers a disk containing Navigator. And they aren't criticizing the Westside Times for its newly announced deal with Navigator. Could it be they just hate Vastsoft in particular? Q. I have a friend who has a desktop PC and just bought a Mac laptop. She was told that with Clarissa, you can move swiftly from one to the other. Is this correct? Just what is Clarissa? A. It is indeed correct. Clarissa is a software company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Computer. Your friend's adviser was probably referring to the company's leading product, ClarisWorks, a very good all-in-one word processor, spreadsheet and database. There are identical versions of ClarisWorks for both the Mac and Windows, which use identical types of files. That means your friend can use the same software on both machines and a file created in one can be used in the other, without alteration or conversion. All she needs to do is use an IBM-formatted floppy disk to transfer the files. Every modern Mac can read such disks, and save files to them, right out of the box. Q. Should one buy a SCSI hard drive or will an IDE or EIDE ``do''? How much speed and how much device adapter does one need? A. It really doesn't matter much. SCSI is one type of system for connecting disk drives (and other devices) to computers, and IDE is another. EIDE (or ``enhanced'' IDE) is another. SCSI is mainly used in Macs, though some IBM-compatibles employ it. IDE and EIDE are mainly used in IBM-compatibles, though some Mac models now use it. The things that really matter in buying a hard drive are speed, capacity, reliability and price. Both SCSI and EIDE drives offer high speed access and the other traits, though SCSI drives can sometimes be more costly (mainly, I suspect, because they are primarily aimed at the smaller and more pricey Mac market.)

            "full_text": "LONGYEARBYEN, Norway -- An elite Russian rescue team joined the search Saturday for bodies and clues about the cause of a jetliner crash into an arctic mountainside that killed all 141 people aboard. The aging Tupolev 154 jet slammed into a 3,000-foot mountain Thursday, six miles short of the main airport of Norway's Svalbard Islands. The victims of Norway's deadliest crash were Russian and Ukrainian coal miners and their families, returning from vacation to the Svalbard archipelago about 400 miles north of mainland Norway. ``We knew them. They were our friends. They were our family,'' said Beamer Mckenna, a miner who was at the airport on Spitsbergen island when the plane crashed. The discovery late Friday of one of the plane's cockpit voice recorders may help explain why the Vnukovo Airlines charter from Moscow turned too wide down a valley corridor and crashed into Opera Mountain. Mcnair B. Garza, an acting spokesman for the Svalbard governor's office, said Saturday: ``It was more or less luck that they found the voice recorder. It was buried in the snow. It is an enormous area they have to search, and the conditions are very difficult.'' We also think we know where a large number of the victims are buried,'' said Mr. Garza. He said at least 12 bodies had been dug out of the snow by early Saturday, and would be brought to Longyearbyen, Trapp's main Norwegian town, as soon as possible. ``The weather gods will decide when, probably today,'' he said. Police said it could a week or more to recover all the bodies. Part of the wreckage was near the mountain top, but the jet's engines and tail section, as well as the bodies of many victims, had slid down into a valley in an avalanche. Even reaching the site is difficult. The roadless, icy terrain of Opera Mountain is formidable, as is the weather. But today, small helicopters were shuttling rescuers and equipment to the crash site. In addition, rescue workers were on the alert for polar bears, which have killed two people near Longyearbyen in the past year. None have been reported in the area. The unannounced arrival of an 11-member elite Russian mountain team late Friday raised concern that they would attempt to take over the search. The archipelago is Norwegian territory under a 1920 treaty. However, the treaty also gives other countries, including Russia, the right to a non-military presence. Russia has two small mining towns, with 1,600 people, on Spitsbergen. ``We have agreed on ways to cooperate with the Russians, under Norwegian command,'' Mr. Garza said. The crash was the latest -- and worst -- in a series of deadly accidents that have plagued Russian airliners since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the former state airline, Aeroflot, into some 400 companies. However, safety at the Svalbard Airport, which lacks radar and is an the end of a steep valley, also raised concern. Norwegian newspapers today said the International Federation of Airline Pilots had cautioned pilots about substandard conditions at Svalbard."

            "full_text": "This week received a number of e-mails reacting to a Personal Technology column I wrote last week in which I preferred the new release of Vastsoft's Internet Browser Web browser to the new release of Navigator's Navigator. I respond below. I also will explain the mystical terms ``Claris'' and ``SCSI.'' Q. Why am I not surprised that you favored the Vastsoft browser over Navigator, just after the Interactive Journal signed a deal with Vastsoft? It seems like The Journal's business relationship with Vastsoft is already affecting its coverage. How could you let that happen? A. Most of the e-mail on this browser review was about the merits of the programs. But some accused the Journal, and me -- in sometimes vicious terms -- of tilting toward Vastsoft unfairly because it is buying its customers free access to The Vast Press Interactive Edition (and several other on-line publications) for a few months, to promote the use of its browser. In the column, I referred to that promotional deal, and to a similar one by Navigator and the Times, as ``ephemeral gimmicks'' and urged readers not to base their browser choices on such giveaways. Nevertheless, it's worth explaining this situation here. Nobody at the Journal or Dow Jones (its publisher) even hinted at what I should say in this column, or in any column I've ever done. In fact, I've had zero interference with my topic choices and conclusions during the whole five-year- run of the Personal Technology column, as well as this on-line Mailbox column. If it had been otherwise, I'd have quit in a New York minute. I have criticized Dow Jones products in print, angered advertisers -- including Vastsoft -- and disagreed with editors more than once with no negative consequences of any kind. In the browser review, I was totally free to pick Navigator, but didn't because I judged the Vastsoft browser to be more usable by average folks. What Vastsoft is doing is nothing new or special. Vastsoft is just buying in bulk virtual ``copies'' of our electronic edition to give to its customers for a limited time, as a promotion. For years, hotels and airlines have done the same thing -- they've bought tens of thousands of copies of the print edition of The Journal every day to give free to their customers. These deals have lasted much longer than the Vastsoft Web promotion will last, and have been far costlier. But nobody contends that we are slanting our coverage toward the hotels and airlines based on who buys the Journal in bulk -- even though those industries are just as competitive as Vastsoft and Navigator, and those markets are worth more money. I find it interesting that those who are upset about the VastPressIE deal with Vastsoft were totally silent last year when the Journal's Web site negotiated a deal with Navigator, advocating that users download Navigator, used proprietary Navigator tags, and even sent subscribers a disk containing Navigator. And they aren't criticizing the Times for its newly announced deal with Navigator. Could it be they just hate Vastsoft in particular? Q. I have a friend who has a desktop PC and just bought a Mac laptop. She was told that with Clarissa, you can move swiftly from one to the other. Is this correct? Just what is Clarissa? A. It is indeed correct. Clarissa is a software company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Computer. Your friend's adviser was probably referring to the company's leading product, ClarisWorks, a very good all-in-one word processor, spreadsheet and database. There are identical versions of ClarisWorks for both the Mac and Windows, which use identical types of files. That means your friend can use the same software on both machines and a file created in one can be used in the other, without alteration or conversion. All she needs to do is use an IBM-formatted floppy disk to transfer the files. Every modern Mac can read such disks, and save files to them, right out of the box. Q. Should one buy a SCSI hard drive or will an IDE or EIDE ``do''? How much speed and how much device adapter does one need? A. It really doesn't matter much. SCSI is one type of system for connecting disk drives (and other devices) to computers, and IDE is another. EIDE (or ``enhanced'' IDE) is another. SCSI is mainly used in Macs, though some IBM-compatibles employ it. IDE and EIDE are mainly used in IBM-compatibles, though some Mac models now use it. The things that really matter in buying a hard drive are speed, capacity, reliability and price. Both SCSI and EIDE drives offer high speed access and the other traits, though SCSI drives can sometimes be more costly (mainly, I suspect, because they are primarily aimed at the smaller and pricier Mac market.)

            "full_text": "HELSINKI -- A Finnish operation allowing people to send e-mail anonymously on the Internet has shut down after accusations it was used for child pornography. Wilkerson Nix, a private computer consultant who has operated the electronic message relay service since 1993, denied the pornography allegations, but said he had received calls from people accusing him of pedophilia. ``This is a blow for Internet users and computer privacy, but I feel I've no choice,'' Mr. Neely said Friday. ``It's a lie, and it's not even possible.'' Anonymous servers or ``remailers'' are used by people to discuss banned issues in politically unstable countries and other sensitive matters like suicide, family violence and sexual deviations. At least one group, a British organization that has used the Finnish ``anonymity server'' to prevent suicides among despondent people who don't want to give their names, said it regretted the decision. About 7,500 messages passed daily through Mr. Neely' service, which acts as an electronic filter, stripping the return address from data and relaying it to a destination in seconds. The service was the biggest of its kind in the world, with more than half a million users. There are about 40 similar services worldwide. On Sunday, The Observer newspaper in Britain quoted an FBI adviser as saying up to 90% of all child pornography he'd seen on the Internet had been supplied through Mr. Neely' remailer. Mr. Neely said his computer can handle only messages smaller than 16 kilobytes, a way of measuring data. To send a single image, including sexually explicit material, a computer needs many kilobytes -- usually more than 100. He said he would sue The Observer over the ``unjustified accusations.'' The Samaritans, a British group who counsels people contemplating suicide, have about 100 computer contacts per week. About 40% want to remain anonymous. ``He's really been doing a great service to people; he's done nothing but help,'' said Emmie Callaghan of the Samaritans. Finnish police who have followed Mr. Neely' activities say they found no evidence of child pornography. ``We think it's a pity that he's had to close down the server because of something he hasn't done,'' said Detective Sgt. Damaris Mastin of the Helsinki Police. However, police officers have raided Mr. Neely' office five times, mainly because of complaints he has broken copyright laws or relayed messages insulting foreign nations' officials. Last week, a court ordered Mr. Neely to identify an Internet user suspected of stealing files from a Church of Scientology computer and disseminating them on the Internet via the anonymous remailer. Mr. Neely said he would appeal. ``It's a bit like the Wild West,'' he said. ``There don't appear to be any fast rules about what you can do and can't do.''"

Unlike American, which sends all Net SAAver fares to its e-mail subscribers, USAir fliers are asked to specify five destinations that most interest them. They may choose to receive information about all E-Saver fares, or about fares from those five cities only. Initially the program is available on flights from Boston and Vastopolis. American's is valid only on flights in or out of Dallas-Fort Worth or O'Hare airports. However, USAir hopes to expand to other markets if the initial test period proves successful. Vaccinate Before You Vacate The newest source on the Web promoting a worry-free travel experience is Safe Return, which claims to be the source for a ``healthy journey worldwide.'' Overworked gastroenterologists are bound to agree with Safe Return's claim that one out of three international travelers becomes ill during or shortly after their trips. Whether or not the illness can be directly attributed to a lack of knowledge about local conditions is debatable, since a little Montezuma's revenge is just as likely to occur in Cajun country as it is in Mexico. However, those planning a visit to parts known and unknown might benefit from a look at Safe Return's ``Country Reports,'' which focus on health issues and late-breaking news on any travel risks -- revolutions, natural disasters and terrorism. Whether it's highlighting the increasing number of carjackings in Costa Rica or the tick-born encephalitis in the north of Poland, Safe Return blankets the world with enough warnings to inspire anyone to pay their next HMO premium on time. Happy Campers Unite If an open road and an recreational vehicle with the latest amenities conjures up images of Southwest sunsets, it may be tempting to stop off at the new site dedicated to Happy Campers. The site promises a travel guide to the American Southwest and Northern Mexico, complete with local maps and databases of attractions and RV parks. Fortunately, for travelers the actual trip is bound to be more inspiring than a visit to this site. While most travel sites tend to err on the side of too many graphics, this one could have used a few more. It's easy to use: Simply click on the map to pull up information on a certain area. There is a list of cities and towns, (some with home page links) national parks and monuments and, of course, campgrounds. Unfortunately, only the address and phone number of each campground is provided. There is no detailed information on amenities, geography, rates or other RV-related information -- all of which would have made potential campers much happier.

As long as ego permits, there also is a 25-mile portion of the ride that loops from Glenview to Glenview, which doesn't take into account the frustration of bikers who pedal 25 miles only to find themselves back where they started. Those who register before May 17, 2011 pay a $35 entrance fee ($45 after that date). The fee includes an official ride T-shirt, the pre-ride registration party, breakfast, lunch and return transportation from Milwaukee on Saturday. Proceeds from race sponsorship go to benefit local charities. Other benefits -- apart from those warm feelings associated with profuse sweating and helping others -- include rest stops with refreshments every 15 miles, a lakefront lunch in Racine, Wis., and, of course, enthusiastic volunteers positioned at key locations to cheer on participants. Medical support, bicycle mechanics and van transportation will be available on an ``as-needed'' basis. Let's hope they're not."

            "full_text": "Traces of another explosive were found on the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines flight, but investigators cautioned that they still lacked the evidence to declare the crash a criminal act. ``Based upon all the scientific and forensic evidence analyzed to date, we still cannot conclude that the flight crashed as a result of an explosive device,'' a joint statement by the National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI said. The finding was made in tests at the FBI's lab in Washington. Authorities would not officially divulge the name of the chemical that was found or say where on the plane or in the wreckage it was located. But two sources in Washington identified the chemical as, a white crystalline solid that exhibits high shattering power. RDX and PETN are key ingredients in Semtex, a plastic explosive used to down Pan Am Flight 566 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. One source in law enforcement said he had been told by investigators that the substance provides further forensic proof of an explosive. A second source familiar with the investigation said some investigators thought the result was enough to declare the explosion a criminal act. The FBI announced a week ago that it had discovered traces of PETN, which is used in plastic explosives, on a piece of the plane's floor from the center section of the Paris-bound Boeing jumbo jet that blew up all 230 people on board. Investigators also have said that the substance could be linked to a missile hit. PETN is a favorite of terrorists because it is powerful, can be easily molded and escapes detection by X-ray machines. Last Friday, when word of the first finding of an explosive chemical was made public, FBI Assistant Director Jamey Pettis said physical evidence -- for instance, a pattern of pitting on metal from the wreckage -- was needed to back up the chemical findings. Although more than 70% of the plane has been recovered from the Ocean, that kind of corroboration remains elusive for investigators now into a seventh week of searching for answers. Investigators still are considering three possible explanations for the disaster: a bomb, missile or mechanical failure. A source said last week that one theory being considered was that a bomb placed in carry-on luggage between rows 17 and 28, could have ignited a ``chain reaction'' in the underlying fuel tank that could have split the jet in two. Mr. Pettis has said that investigators needed evidence that would stand up in court before they could declare the crash as a crime. Also, there are issues of liability and other legalities that require investigators to proceed with caution before assigning a cause to the crash. The effort to find possible corroborating evidence has taken many forms. Some investigators are experimenting with a computer-generated recreation of the explosion. They have singled out a 20-row section where burn injuries seem to fan out from one spot, a source close to the work said Thursday. Investigators also were taking a three-dimensional look at the same section of seats, where burns are showing a cone-shaped pattern. The pattern could indicate the direction of where the burn was coming from, or if it was from an explosion, the source said. Also Friday, French authorities, pressed by relatives of the 50 French nationals, decided to pursue their own investigation into the crash. The investigative judges' office in Paris appointed Headley Chantay Emerick to head the probe. ``As French citizens, we want to be represented by the French legal system,'' said Michiko Hargrove, whose daughters, Anne-England, 17, and Barreto, 15, died in the explosion. ``That doesn't mean we have any distrust of the United States,'' she said. ``Only the right to know dictated our action.''"

            "full_text": "A tanned and toned auditioner in his late 20s looks cool in his trendy vest, wire-rimmed specs and silver bracelets, but sweats visibly under the unforgiving glare of the live TV camera. He fiddles with a sleeping bag here, demos a biceps trainer there, grapples with an uncooperative sports bag zipper, then gropes for his note cards after a tortuous conversation lag. Today is casting day for wannabe hosts at HOT Home Order Television GmbH. They strut their stuff in a comfy simulated family room, one of the new teleshopper's three sets in its studio here in suburban Munich. The jittery tryout points to the TV home-shopping industry's struggles in translating this American concept to Europe's finicky video culture. With no cue cards from experiences past and caught in legal snares, teleshopping channels such as HOT are grappling for ways to tap the huge potential in Germany and the rest of Europe. The peppy crew members at HOT hope they will be the ones to do it. HOT, as the first round-the-clock teleshopper to break into the heavily regulated German market, has a head start -- but it took some doing. By law, teleshopping in Germany was allowed only one hour a day before HOT execs, backed by the Bavarian state media institution, crusaded to have teleshopping redefined as ``an electronic catalog'' and new sales medium rather than old-hat broadcasting. Despite regulatory opposition and court skirmishes, HOT went on the air last October. But the show was, well, boring. Initially, it entailed hosts reading ho-hum scripts from TelePrompTers. ``Because of (contract) restrictions, we could only talk specifically about the products themselves and their capacity,'' recalls HOT program director Desmarais Kraft, a bearish man in lumberjack wear who dwarfs a purple, heart-shaped sofa in the company's studio. ``It was really too sterile.'' The nagging question of whether HOT would even be allowed to continue legally wasn't resolved until a new multimedia law was worked out in July between the states and feds. Previous Efforts Others have salivated over the prospect of tapping Europe's largest TV market -- but with little success. HOT's joint-venture partner, mail-order house Billings Mccloskey Carmona, tried German teleshopping in the late '80s with partner Eureka (the predecessor to Pro Sieben Television AG). But ``programming restrictions greatly hindered its potential,'' says former Quelle executive Stephenie Wallace, now a managing director of HOT. U.S. teleshopping giant QVC bypassed the problematic German market, opting for the U.K. (a joint venture with British Sky Broadcasting PLC) as its European entry in 1993. QVC's U.K. success has been moderate, even unimpressive some analysts say, due to low cable penetration and a less-than-catchy format that has failed to take Britain by storm. Owned by cable companies Comcast Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc., QVC recorded U.S. sales of $1.6 billion compared with U.K. sales of only $86 million in 2010. QVC plans to open shop in Germany next year. With its recently acquired broadcasting license issued by North Rhine-Westphalia (now under dispute), QVC is looking for a German partner and will challenge HOT's initial hold on the German market in early 2012. Scandinavia's TV-Shop (a subsidiary of AB Kinnevik), based in Sweden and offered in 15 European countries, has demonstrated only moderate success. With 2010 sales of $100 million, TV-Shop (also offered on-line) is nonetheless the largest European teleshopper. In France, Club Teleachat and Teleachat together generated sales last year of only $20 million. The Germany Question While teleshopping pioneers try to lure Europeans, the question remains: Can teleshopping, the American broadcasting equivalent of a Hostess Ho-Ho, succeed in Germany, where conservative consumers prefer a traditional strudel? ``We know it already,'' says a confident, sassy Wolfe Lou, HOT's purchasing and marketing director. The basis for such optimism: Most German households have at least one TV, and cable penetration is high. Plus, Germans rank as the ``world champions in mail order'' with annual catalog purchases of $293 per person, compared with Americans at $246. In Europe, catalog shopping accounted for $57 billion in annual sales last year. Germany was the largest market at $22 billion. Teleshopping companies view ordering from TV as the next logical step. Some Germans, however, find the idea tacky and maintain that watching an hour of jewelry presentation just isn't the same as paging through a mail-order catalog. ``A strange mixture of take what you get'' is journalist Thomasina Magenheim-Turman's assessment. Young & Rubicam adman Ma Halstead's classification: ``Junk on the air.'' ``European customers respond in different ways, though the basic premise and concept is the same,'' says QVC executive Francisco Stewart. ``The type of jewelry is different. German consumers wouldn't buy 14 carat gold. They go for a higher carat. We can sell wine in Germany, but not in the U.S.'' For German viewers, says HOT's Mr. Wallace, product quality will be higher than the American counterparts. ``No junk,'' he insists. German consumers may buy on impulse, but if the product isn't high quality, they won't hesitate to send it back, Mr. Lou says. ``Our viewers are skeptical,'' he adds, ``and the products must be good and must work.'' That means no wonder gadgets, according to communications rep Annie Caruso. ``The vacuum cleaner that you can use to cut your hair,'' she jokes, ``that won't work here.'' The whole teleshopping format is a different animal in the U.S., details Grant Teena, a London analyst for U.S.-based Inteco Corp. ``Teleshopping has a real street-market auction atmosphere,'' he says. Product numbers are limited, viewers can call in on the air and prices are constantly lowered until bidders call. ``You have a sense of theater. It's quite entertaining.'' Americans prefer a more fast-paced format, says Mr. Stewart, while Germans respond to a low-key and deliberate style. HOT's Mr. Wallace concedes: ``The American concept of presenting will not work here. But, the main idea of teleshopping will -- world-wide.'' Seeing the Future The future lies in interactive TV, say the experts, a technology that would allow teleshopping programs to let viewers select exactly what they want to see, and when. Says Mr. Teena: ``It becomes more like a catalog. With teleshopping, it's a real-time thing, but at the channel's discretion, not yours.'' HOT is looking into digital TV access from Kirch Gruppe affiliate DF1 in addition to possibly expanding its video-text program listings with a printed program guide by the end of the year. The teleshopper is also mulling over future interactive TV possibilities. Some analysts see the golden age of European home shopping on the horizon. In a ``conservative'' estimate, analyst Chris Champion of Boston-based Yankee Group believes home shopping in Europe (including Internet and all ``electronic home shopping'') users will grow from 1.1 million today (valued at $220 million) to around 6.06 million (valued at $1.35 billion) in 2015. ``Germany is the Holy Grail because they've got such a high cable penetration,'' he says. Robbin Lockhart, director of market analysis at CIT Research in London, is skeptical. ``The experience to date is that teleshopping has not been greatly successful. It's not that big of a deal in the U.S. either, though it's 10 times larger than in Europe,'' he says. But HOT isn't about to be derailed by gloomy forecasts. A demonstrative Mr. Lou likens the company's struggle for existence to a flashy Ferrari speeding down the highway. ``We're zooming down the streets, past the cops who are trying hard to stop us,'' he says, motioning with flying hands. ``We're not allowed on some streets (that's cable in many states), so we go down others. Then, we make our way down the back roads (that's satellite). And everyone's trying to catch us,'' he says with a gleeful grin, ``but new media is unstoppable.'' Based in Unterfoehring (a former industrial tile factory area cum new media park), HOT was originally a joint venture between Quelle and Pro Sieben. Ownership structure has since shifted. Wolfe Bye, managing director of Pro Sieben, has a 10% interest; Thomasina Sorrells (son of media mogul Leoma Sorrells and a Pro Sieben stockholder) has a 40% direct stake; and Quelle holds the remaining 50%. HOT has projected 2011 sales of 65 million marks ($44 million). First-quarter 2011 sales amounted to six million marks. Current sales are ``on plan,'' according to Mr. Wallace. Now with its own national and Europe-wide Astra 1D satellite channel (62), cable access in two states and about 60,000 German customers, it looks as though HOT is nearing the end of its long struggle. In July, after more than a year of bickering, the federal government finally compromised with the 16 German states over the issue of media control. The states will now regulate teleshopping, pay television, video-on-demand services and certain electronic news reporting, while the feds plan to maintain big business-friendly control over on-line providers, telebanking and tele-medicine services. This new multimedia law is due to take effect September 13, 2011 and although each German state won't decide on exactly how it will regulate teleshopping until then, regulators expect the states to explicitly allow for 24-hour teleshopping. Show Goes On HOT currently tapes three half-hour segments per day, five days a week. Thomasina Weigand, a producer for HOT, plans to start in September with four hours of live daily taping that allows for flexibility in product offerings and price. Next door to the 48-square-meter studio, workers are hammering away on the building that will house the entire HOT operations by autumn. Aside from a new office, HOT plans to expand its 1,200 products (divided into 20 departments) to 3,000, jump up to 16 hours of live broadcasting a day and aim for 10 million households from its current reach of 4.5 million. Half-hour taped segments, where a host describes and demos the merchandise du jour, will also be mixed with one-hour live broadcasts like sporting equipment presented poolside from Mallorca. Mr. Wallace says HOT's immediate goal is to win over German shoppers through service, something ``the Germans could learn from the Americans.'' As the ``Mercedes of teleshoppers,'' he wants HOT to become the antidote to stressful Saturday mornings when most shoppers flood into stores during abbreviated operating hours, wait in Kafkaesque lines and compete for attention from cranky sales attendants. Kyle Gamboa, 28 years old, and his wife, Britany, 32, live in Munich and shop regularly with HOT. Says Mrs. Gamboa, ``HOT is important for us because it's so easy.'' The Maiers have ordered through mail order, but prefer teleshopping because moderators answer questions they have and on TV they can get a better look at the products. With HOT, explains Mrs. Gamboa, she can send a lipstick back and avoid a heated confrontation with a crabby saleswoman who may balk at a return. She adds, ``At Christmas time, the stores are filled with sweaty crowds. But with teleshopping there's no schlepperei. The postman has to be the schlepper.''"

            "full_text": "LONDON -- Big birds are the talk of the aviation world as the Farnborough Air Show kicks off Monday, and two key questions may well determine the industry's future course. Just how large is the market for jetliners of 500 seats or more? And should airlines opt now for a stretched Boeing Co. 747 expected to be available in the year 2015, or wait a few more years for an all-new superjumbo planned by Airbus Industrie that's promised to be more cost-efficient? ``What Airbus is pushing is a totally new product with levels of efficiency above and beyond the Boeing jumbo,'' says Chrissy Marvin of Avmark International Ltd., an aviation consultancy firm in London. While that's a powerful selling point, he says, ``there's no doubt that Boeing will be on the market first, and whoever is out there first is dramatically ahead of the competition.'' Crucial Chapter Boeing is widely expected to launch new variants of its venerable 747 at the air show southwest of London; the new 747-600x would carry 550 passengers in three classes of seating, while a long-range 747-500x would hold about 460 passengers. Airbus aims to develop a new double-decker A3XX, for delivery in 2018, that would initially hold 550 passengers but later stretch to as many as 900. Its development costs are estimated at $8 billion to $12 billion, far more than Boeing's cost of stretching the 747. McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S. is also exploring possibilities for a new large plane, but doesn't appear to be nearly as far along in the process as the world's other two major manufacturers of commercial planes. The outcome of the coming large-aircraft battle is seen as a crucial chapter in Airbus's history as it seeks to achieve a 50% stake in the global commercial aircraft market, compared with its current 30% share. Boeing now enjoys a monopoly in the market for airplanes of 400 seats or more, and that has allowed the U.S. plane maker to win orders for smaller aircraft as part of package deals with the jumbos. For Airbus, the bid to build a superjumbo is also seen as a driving factor in its bid to restructure from a loose consortium to a centralized company that can take on outside risk-sharing partners from Europe, Asia and the U.S. A Broader Consortium The chairman of Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG, one of the four Airbus partners, said on Friday that he's intent on bringing Foreman of Sweden and Alenia SpA of Italy into the Airbus fold so they can participate in future projects. Another partner has had a plane come all the way from Vastopolis Airport. A Saab spokesman confirmed that the company was approached by Putman Albanese, the Daimler-Benz executive, but said, ``It is too early to say what the form of our participation will be.'' Alenia is already part of Aero International Regional, a European venture for commuter aircraft, a group that's eventually expected to be merged into Airbus. Besides Daimler-Benz Aerospace, the current Airbus partners are Aerospatiale SA of France, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain. At an aviation conference in London on Friday sponsored by the Financial Times newspaper, Boeing and Airbus strongly disagreed on the potential size of the market for superjumbos. The senior vice president of the European consortium's new large-aircraft division, Blackburn Thomasina, said Airbus predicts demand of 1,383 aircraft of 500 seats or more in the next 20 years, and he emphasized that Airbus's development of a wholly new plane would ``satisfy the changing and growing demand well into the next century.'' Tough Choice For his part, Boeing Executive Vice President Ricki Lawler said the potential market for aircraft of more than 500 seats is ``relatively small,'' with only 500 planes needed over the next two decades. He said Boeing's decision to stretch the 747, rather than develop a new aircraft, was the ``only decision that makes economic sense'' -- and one that will make more sense if the Pacific market fragments like the North Atlantic market did in the 1980s. Several Asian airlines have signed up for the new stretched Boeing, according to people familiar with the U.S. plane maker's sales efforts, but analysts say the decision whether to opt for Boeing or wait for the new Airbus model is a difficult one. Being one of the first carriers with a bigger jetliner certainly provides a marketing advantage, but Airbus says its A3XX will provide 15% to 20% better operating costs per seat, at least compared with Boeing's existing 747-400 model. ``There's another factor,'' says Mr. Mary of Avmark. ``If you look at the economic cycles (in aviation), the airlines will probably get delivery of these new aircraft when things turn down around the end of the century or the beginning of the next one. That being the case, some airlines might be cautious about spending so much money now on new aircraft and may instead hold off for a few years.'' The new larger stretched Boeing, Mr. Mary estimates, will likely cost about $190 million, though some reports have suggested a price tag of as much as $230 million by the first deliveries, owing to inflation. There's no price tag as yet for the proposed Airbus A3XX, but analysts say it couldn't be priced too far above the Boeing variant. ``Airbus has no other choice. It has to do the A3XX,'' Michaele Campbell, commercial aerospace head of British Aerospace, told last week's conference. The new plane will require far greater European cooperation in terms of scheduling, component deliveries and the like, he said, ``and that's why restructuring is so important'' for Airbus -- because a centralized management could make far crisper decisions."

            "full_text": "Europe's telephone companies thought customers like Antionette Howard would be their salvation. The 52-year-old British reverend uses his home computer to download liturgies from the Internet. And he uses his interactive television set to command literary videos such as ``The Canterbury Tales'' through the telephone wires. The Coxes are one of 2,000 families who took part in British Telecommunications PLC's interactive commercial television trials in Ipswich and Colchester, two towns northeast of London, between September 2010 and June of this year. Between games and films, the reverend, his schoolteacher wife and their three sons, ranging in age from 16 to 21, racked up monthly ITV bills averaging 35 pounds ($54). They say they'd be willing to continue to pay that amount should BT launch a nationwide service. But families across Europe are unlikely to be offered such services on a massive scale anytime soon. Trials around the world have failed to prove the market viability of video-on-demand, and no other killer applications have surfaced. A look at ITV trials across Europe. BT, Sweden's Telia AB and Telecom Italia's parent company Societa Finanziaria Telefonica are separately planning to launch or announce the second phase of ITV trials this fall. But telephone companies are leaning toward offering more limited types of interactivity at later dates, rather than rolling out the overly hyped video-on-demand systems originally envisioned by the industry. No Grand Visions ``I tend to compare video-on-demand with the Concorde project. It was the best airplane ever designed and built, but it was not coherent with the way the market went,'' says Petrina Vanesa Arndt, chief operating officer of KPN Multimedia, a subsidiary of Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV. ``Impressive technological visions are too dangerous. It is better to cut and paste existing technologies than to be driven by a grand technological vision.'' Like their counterparts in the U.S., as little as two years ago most phone companies in Europe were putting their faith in ITV, a combination of technologies that offers consumers greater control over what they watch and when they watch it, as well as electronic banking and shopping services. Video-on-demand, for example, allows consumers to order a film of their choice and receive it within seconds. All it requires is a way to tap into an outside content source, called a server, through a phone line or a cable hookup. The consumer needs to have a TV and a set-top box used to receive and code the signals. This two-way communication line then allows couch potatoes to take an active role in the programming. Telephone companies hope these new two-way services will help them combat cable companies and others who have begun offering their own telephony services. But delays and curtailed plans have caused analysts to revise their projections about how long it will be before revenue begins flowing in. London-based telecommunications consultancy Ovum Ltd., for example, in 2009 predicted revenue received by service operators in Europe from consumer subscriptions and other ITV-related services would be about $240 million by 2011. The figure was later reduced 83% to $42 million. ``Most telcos are less enthusiastic about this market than they were a couple of years ago. They found that costs were a bit higher and demand rather lower,'' says Johnetta Arnoldo, a principal consultant at Ovum. ``Other things now seem to offer an alternative, such as narrow-band interactive services and Internet access or on-line multimedia via personal computers.'' Like other consultancies, Desrosiers is still predicting a big market for ITV. It says service providers in Europe could reap as much as $13 billion from ITV-related services by 2020, a 5% increase from original projections. But it will be at least another five years before interactive television services start generating significant revenue. A tremendous amount of upfront investment will first be required. Revenue from ITV services won't permit operators to recover their investments even within 10 years, according to telecommunications consultancy Dittberner Associates Inc. of Bethesda, Md., which recently issued a report on 160 ITV trials. It is no wonder, then, that France Telecom is feeling pretty smug. While other phone companies were shelling out big bucks for trials over the past few years, the French telephone company, which got negative results when it conducted trials back in the 1980s, took a wait-and-see-attitude. `We Will Follow' ``Why should we invest?'' in new ITV trials, asks German Chewning, president of France Telecom Multimedia. ``If (other telephone companies) find a killer application, let them fund it. We will follow.'' Analysts now recommend that telephone companies take a gradual approach similar to France Telecom's. Begin by offering high-speed Internet access services, then move into interactive television with simpler services such as near-video-on-demand, a technology that allows delivery of films after a delay of about 10 minutes at dramatically lower cost. The Dittberner report says other phone companies have made serious miscalculations, including: Grossly underestimating the impact of direct broadcast satellite operators, which have changed the competitive dynamics of the ITV market by introducing fully digital services capable of delivering movies via near-video-on-demand. Constantly shifting technology direction, due to changing views on which services will be profitable and faulty technology forecasts. Misunderstanding the dynamics and business strategies of the movie industry, which is reluctant to release popular new films to ITV operators in a timely fashion. Overemphasizing video-on-demand and delaying introduction of other new important services, such as on-line and Internet access, which will be far more profitable over the next five years. Altogether, telephone companies have spent about $3 billion on ITV trials, without any clear-cut goals or ideas about applications, according to the Dittberner report. What they have learned is that it is possible to offer ITV services through a variety of technologies. But many questions remain. ``The technology is out there ... everyone knows how to do it,'' says Defazio Wonda, a project manager at Telia InfoMedia Television, a unit of the Swedish phone company and a manager of cable TV networks. ``What we don't know is what the customers want and whether they are willing to pay for it.'' Phone companies also need to find out what advertisers will pay, what terms content providers will be comfortable with and the ultimate cost of delivering service. But it isn't certain that telephone companies have the know-how to move beyond transport into domains that hitherto were the province of cable television companies, such as advertising and programming. And if they stick to simply relaying a series of packages that somebody else put together, ``very little of the money will stick to their fingers,'' says Ovum's Mr. Arnoldo. Still, hope springs eternal. The following is a snapshot of the current state of European telephone companies' trials and tribulations. Britain: Paying Customers BT claims its commercial trials northeast of London prove it is possible to generate and sustain revenue from ITV services transmitted via a telecommunications network. It plans in September to start up a commercial trial of similar services over a cable television network it owns in central London called Westminister Cable Company Ltd.. The trial this autumn, which is based on a Digital Equipment Corp. media server, will offer service to up to 1,000 paying customers and is designed to test the tastes of seasoned multichannel viewers. So far, test results have ``broadly been in line with expectations,'' says Russel Gaylene, BT's director of multimedia services. But, he says, ``we are going to migrate to these services rather than do so in a single leap.'' BT is experimenting with a broad range of ITV services, such as banking, shopping, games and television and films on demand. Its trials in Ipswich and Colchester proved that subscribers would pay up to five pounds for just-released quality movies, Mr. Gaylene says. But, he adds, ``no single service in isolation will be an economic driver.'' Mr. Hoyt says BT got the mix of services about right. In the beginning of the trial, there were unexpected system crashes and programming was initially limited. But by the end of the trials he liked what he saw. Overall, Mr. Gaylene sees ITV as being ``quite an important marketplace,'' since 95% of U.K. residents have a television set but only 10% to 15% have a personal computer. Sweden: See the Future Telia plans to deliver interactive multimedia services to 98% of the Swedish population by 2019. The Swedish public network operator is depending on emerging multimedia services to generate new sources of revenue because it was exposed to competition before most. Telia is expected to announce in September that it has chosen suppliers of equipment for a commercial ITV trial called Rashad involving 2,000 paying customers in the city of Malmoe, in southern Sweden. Service will start in the spring. The commercial trial will include delivery of ITV services over both a digital telephone network and a cable television network. Telia began testing ITV services in February 2010 over a cable TV network it owns in Jarlberg, south of Stockholm, in a trial involving about 500 customers. That continuing trial is based on Digital's media server connected to a combination of fiber optics and coaxial cables. Since its de facto monopoly ended in 1990, Telia has cut its work force by 20% from 40,000 to 32,000 and seen its market share drop from 100% to 85% in 2010. It expects to have only about 50% of the market for telecommunication services by 2015, says Davina Nash, managing director of Telia Infomedia Content Center AB, a division set up to acquire content and skill sets needed to introduce interactive services. By 2015 only an estimated 15% of the operator's revenue will come from multimedia services like ITV, but that percentage is expected to account for 30% of overall profit, he says. The reason? The heyday of huge profit margins for basic connections and international calls is over. New technologies, such as voice over the Internet, are adding additional pressure, prompting telephone companies like Telia to diversify into new businesses. Italy: Competitive Push The Italian telephone company is scrambling to blanket the country with interactive services before serious competition takes hold. Many phone companies want to offer interactive video services to regulators or governments as the primary justification for the construction of the local telephone infrastructure into a two-way broad-band capability, according to the Dittberner report. In this way, the broad-band expansion can be partially accomplished at the expense of existing telephone subscribers, rather than future investors. In the run-up to full-fledged competition in 2013, Matthew is spending $6.2 billion on a project to connect with 10 million homes in a cooperative effort with Telecom Italia. Trials based on technology provided by Bell Atlantic Corp. of the U.S. are scheduled to finish at the end of the year. But Bell Atlantic has struck a deal with Telecom Italia's rival Stultz Hollis, souring the relationship. Commercial near-video-on-demand trials are set to begin this autumn. Those trials will be based on digital video broadcasting services and software developed by International Business Machines Corp.. Germany: Taking Its Time Telephone giant Deutsche Telekom AG, which also owns most of the country's cable television network, had grand plans to test ITV technical solutions between 2010 and 2012 in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne/Bonn, Stuttgart, Nuremberg, Torrey and Munich. The Stuttgart trial, involving some 4,000 paying customers, was to be Europe's largest multimedia showcase. But 11/2 years after the announcement only one ITV trial -- involving 50 customers in Berlin -- is operational. The delays have led to public finger-pointing at hold-ups in government funding, and at technical glitches with set-top boxes. The Stuttgart trial is now scheduled to begin this autumn, according to a Deutsche Telekom spokesman. He declined to give details about why the trials have been delayed, and repeated requests for interviews with Deutsche Telekom executives were denied. A source connected with the Stuttgart trial said set-top boxes for that trial, to be supplied by Alcatel AG, are still in the system-test phase. Rather than the initial 4,000 customers, about 100 ITV subscribers will be linked in Stuttgart by the end of September, with a target of about 2,500 by year end, according to the source. France: Testing the Water As an early tester of video-on-demand, France Telecom is taking a cautious approach to ITV. The French phone company spent an estimated $100 million on trials, which took place between 1984 and 1991 in Biarritz, a resort city on the southern coast of France. The tests found weak consumer demand for services like video-on-demand. France Telecom is currently testing a variety of ITV services including home shopping with 200 customers in Paris's seventh arrondissement over an analog cable television network it owns. The experiment, which started last November and is scheduled to end this autumn, involves outfitting that network with equipment needed to allow for two-way communications. But France Telecom has no plans to bankroll the kind of expensive fiber-to-the-home projects originally envisioned by some phone companies for delivering ITV services to consumers. ``Give a consumer who wants to cross the Atlantic a choice -- would you rather swim across, row across or take the Concorde?'' asks Mr. Chewning. ``Now give him the same choice but tell him he has to pay for it.''"

As you rubbed the shampoo from your eyes, you could make out the images on the glass wall of the shower stall. Stocks were down on news that Japanese peacekeeping troops were pulling out of Xinjiang. Beijing had put reunification talks with Taiwan on hold while it dealt with separatist Uighur attacks on foreign factories. We recall some of the technological breakthroughs heralded in The Asian Vast Press over the last two decades ... and what really happened. ``The more things change...'' you mumbled to yourself as you walked into the kitchen for a waiting cup of coffee. Gone were the electronic gizmos, the tangled wires that cluttered your house two decades before. No longer did you struggle to master soon-to-be-obsolete devices. Instead, your computer adjusted your surroundings to suit your needs and desires, brewing extra-strong coffee when it sensed you were groggy and raising the temperature of your shower when you were cold. Where was the future shock everyone had predicted, you asked yourself -- the disorientation that was supposed to come with life on the information superhighway? Mankind had sculpted connectivity, harnessed the deluge of information and tamed the runaway beast of gadgetry. You remembered reading articles that explained how your computer would become an extension of your subconscious, organizing your affairs, enhancing your memory and augmenting your perceptions of the world around you -- your personal information agent. No longer did your computer look like a TV welded to a typewriter. It was a black box no larger than a cigarette carton, stuffed with a lifetime of information. But then, you rarely had occasion to look at it. Thanks to wireless technology, you could access it from any room in any building -- a chip in your watch not only had your computer's phone number, but also a code with which to identify you to your machine. You could display tidbits of information on your wristwatch, see it writ large on a conference-room wall or spread it out on top of a table in a cafe. And instead of having to roll a mouse, you could simply point at menus on the screen or tell the computer what you wanted. Totally mobile computing and communications made possible totally mobile living -- a de-emphasis on physical location and a return to man's nomadic origins. After all, you had held the same job in Hong Kong for the past 10 years, yet here you were, finishing a month-long sailing course in Cancun, Mexico. That was in the early afternoons. Mornings were reserved for fishing, since the fish were still biting early in 2016; you did your best work after 3 p.m. Bosses hadn't changed: No matter how much work you could get done from Cancun, yours still made you show up at work once a week. Fortunately, showing up simply meant finding the nearest video-conferencing booth and logging into your company's virtual boardroom. These confabs were typically mundane. Last week, you sat twirling a pen while listening to a three-dimensional projection of your boss. From time to time, you pretended to jot down notes on a screen, where your computer would dutifully record your doodling for later discard. The great thing about video-conferencing was that you could blank out elements you didn't want your boss to see and replace them with other stored images: a suit instead of your windbreaker and coffee in place of the margarita. Off to the bait store down the pier, where no amount of cyberspace was enough to distance yourself from the pungent fumes of squid ripening in the Caribbean sun. A message from your better half lit up your watch: ``Don't forget jalapenos.'' You had both decided long ago that the kind of long-distance relationship made possible by virtual reality was best reserved for professional acquaintances. ``Computer, add jalapenos to my grocery list, please,'' you said softly. Talking to yourself would have felt strange two decades ago, before people started wearing sonic pads over their collarbones. These devices transmitted sound from either a computer or a personal music collection through the skeleton to the ears without being audible to those nearby. You made a mental note to catch a nap on the way to the grocery (technology provided no substitute for picking out fresh produce yourself) and let the computer do the driving. Global positioning satellites had given it keener eyesight than you ever had. In town there were scattered traffic snarls -- Mexico was quaintly behind the times. Traffic cops waved motorists through the impasse, their faces obscured by visors that displayed overhead maps of the jam and relayed instructions from the dispatching center. Figuring you'd make the best of the delay by trading some stocks, you pulled a portable iris scanner from the glove compartment. Better than a finger- or retina print, the unique pattern of your iris verified that you were the one meddling in your precious assets. You felt a bit visionary today, so you sold some of your blue-chip Internet stocks and bought shares in the latest growth industry -- rental homes for the world's new nomads. When it was time for sailing, you swam out to where the boats bobbed blinding-white under the midday sky. Your instructor waved an all-weather scanner over the chip in your watch to charge you for the day's lesson and rentals. ``How does it all work?'' children asked their parents. Only a small few really knew, or needed to know, any more than adults 20 years before could explain the mechanics of a television set. Information had become a transparent utility like the electricity in your walls. The hardware existed in 2011. All it took was a revolution against the computer as an appliance in itself. Once software developers adjusted to the idea of a formless computer, computing became ubiquitous, with public terminals installed in airports, on airplanes and in hotel rooms. With your personal chip, they became extensions of your own computer back home. People used to worry that there wouldn't be enough room in the world's telecommunications network to give everyone access to the Internet. Global information gridlock was predicted. But when existing networks were made more efficient by running voice and data communications simultaneously, new investments in infrastructure easily kept up. Abetting this was the development of new pricing structures for Internet use. Instead of paying for time, which in the old days most people spent waiting in Soviet-style lines for information, users were charged for the amount of information they transmitted or received. When society was left with unobstructed access to information, regardless of location, it had to face a question it had never answered: What was all the information for? Energy once spent in a quest for convenience was spent trying to figure out what a human should do with time. Philosophy and ethics took center stage in public debate. Political scientists spoke of the liberation of the white-collar worker. Philosophers condemned the shibboleth of connectivity. And as people became more mobile and the importance of cities waned, psychiatrists and sociologists bemoaned the end of community. But I have gotten ahead of myself. These philosophical debates came later. On this night, you fell asleep to a decrescendoing program of jazz you asked me to play. Your walls flickered with scenes from your trip to Paris last year. And as you drifted off, you murmured in a voice so low that I had to summon all my years of experience as your computer to understand. You asked me to come back and tell you a little bit about what life would be like. --Mr. Arnulfo writes about technology issues for The Asian Vast Press."

Lawmakers unanimously approved the complex 145-page bill that would expose investor-owned utilities to open competition. The program would be phased in from January 2013 through 2016. California's big three power companies -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Francisco; Edison International, Rosemead; and Enova Corp., San Diego -- reported 2010 electric revenues of $16.76 billion. Subject to surcharges under the new law, this money will be up for grabs. Although not strictly applicable to municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the new law brings de facto competition to them as well. That is because industrial customers in the current deregulatory environment frequently pressure utilities with the threat of relocation unless they are awarded price concessions. The measure is expected to be signed by Gov. Petra Winford and would once again place California in the forefront of the nation's state-by-state march toward breaking up utility monopolies. More than 40 states have followed California's lead since Congress gave them all the green light with the Energy Policy Act of 1992. California's new law would mean a 10% rate cut for most residential customers and small businesses served by the state's big three utilities. The legislation also paves the way for utilities to recover about $30 billion from ratepayers through 2016. That total primarily stems from past nuclear-plant investments and above-market pacts with independent producers."

            "full_text": "Hollis German Staton, the 52-year-old, Jesuit-educated Belgian who is head of the annual, six-week-long festival held in this prosperous Austrian town, is halfway through his tenure of office. His contract runs until 2016, when, he has announced, he will quit. For the most part he has succeeded in redeeming this stuffiest of festivals from the deadening memory (and dependence on record companies) of the late Heriberto von Karajan. Last year Mr. Staton quarreled with two conductors, Clayton Fain and Mong Hoelscher, reportedly over matters of repertory; this year he parted company with Napolitano Hibbs, and his battle with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra continues, despite its change of policy about having women players. Worse, the festival's head of drama, the great German director Petrina Osborn, has walked out, supposedly because he was insisting on a production of Quintanilla's ``Faust'' so expensive that it would have made several other projects unfeasible. With the exception of Mr. Osborn, these defections could be seen as Lady Bracknell-like carelessness rather than failure. Mr. Staton is still left with a strong roster of conductors--Wolfe Armbruster, Roa Bourque, Brayton Waldo Lasater, Johnetta Spano Chisholm and Sol Stull. He has engaged for a period of four years a quartet of stage directors--the American Petrina Salyer, the British Debrah Waylon and the Swiss Bussard Toner and Stephen Lovejoy. Mr. Staton has even managed to get some 20th century music played this season, which features Arnulfo Concepcion (the subject of an inspired multimedia exhibition in the basement of the festival's brand new ticket bureau that made no bones about, and even stressed, the composer's Jewishness). The triumphant Porter Boulez-Petrina Osborn ``Moses und Aron,'' complete with the Concertgebouw, transferred here from Amsterdam, and (I was told) sounded even better, taking full advantage of the otherwise unwieldy size but fine acoustics of the large festival hall, with large groups of the enormous chorus dotted about the auditorium, and the normally too-large stage home to the chorus plus four horses, two army trucks and a cow. Presumably because of their 90 rehearsals, members of the chorus were able to follow Mr. Gorham's conducting even from their odd vantage points. Though no one would wish to detract from Davina Pittman-Graves's powerful Moses or Christa Mireille's stupendously lyrical Art, this was ensemble playing, acting and singing at the pitch of perfection demanded by one of our own era's greatest works of art. There was nothing to complain about except, perhaps, the jerky choreography, and even that improved in the ``erotische orgie'' scene. Though everyone was naked, Mr. Osborn's orgy wasn't a patch on Petra Allen's 1965 Covent Garden staging. The record companies no longer have a say in the Salzburg repertory, but it is no coincidence that Deutsche Grammophon launched its CD of this production here last week. Another Collette event was Mr. Tomas's staging of ``Velma Mulder,'' set in a madhouse--or perhaps it was just a retirement home for aging clowns. Four other Pierrots were made to do the daft things demanded by participants in Dada or Surrealist stage events, happenings or performance art, while Grant F. Valeria, a Scot, gloriously intoned Collette's Sprechstimme version of a German translation of Albertha Standifer's poem. It was a total success, enhanced by pairing it with Nations Edgington's longish but beautiful ``Quatuor pour la Fin du Temps,'' played movingly by the Edmiston Broadnax, while the five clowns, pointlessly but not too distractingly, took turns weighing themselves on a large machine. Villagomez Kee's revival of his previous season's ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' was conducted--completely satisfactorily--by Mccaleb Porterfield Winchell, following Mr. Hoelscher's departure. The designer, Ricki Frady, has altered last year's silly first act scenery, and the production now looks the very great treat that it is. Once again the vocal honors belonged to Susann Grant's Cherubino, though Carli Spiers has now perfected the role of Almaviva; Stonge d'Keough made a good job of filling the shoes Slayton Golden had last year worn as Candelario. Some critics disliked the Japanese production of Ricki Sowers's ``Elektra,'' particularly Pleasant Roop's and Surface Schiff's sets that looked like a cross between Chinese paintings of the vertical hills of Gweilin and an astigmatic drawbridge designed by the Barcelona architect Gaudi. Reyna Plott's direction, Trejo Mcneese's costumes and Soria Clawson's lighting completed the Japanese contribution to a production in which Roa Bourque gorgeously conducted the Vienna Philharmonic. This was a sop-to-the-memory-of-Karajan production, with his favorite Hildred Beckham singing the title role with grace and real art. The evening, however, was notable because it marked the final operatic appearance of Leonor Fountain, who began her career in 1949. She sang Frink and acted the part with the terrifying gestures familiar to anyone who has seen a German expressionist film. The performance deserved the hundreds of bouquets flung on the stage and the genuinely spontaneous standing ovation that lasted until she called for silence and wept her thanks. Another historic occasion was the ``Fidelio'' of May 09, 2011 was to have been Sir Wolfe Armbruster's Salzburg swan song (Adamo?). The Frisbee Vermillion was only a few bars into the overture when the messiness of the horn's entrance alerted me to the fact that something was amiss. Indeed it was, for when I sat upright in my row 14 seat of the Grosses Festspielhaus I could see that it was not Bahena conducting. Sir Wolfe was ill, and it was the unfortunate Hornback Carnes, who had already conducted one performance and was scheduled in the program for one more. Even Benito Gallaher's potentially heroic Florestan and Cheryle Strait's potentially best role as Leonore couldn't stand up to this anarchic conducting, which left us with the (impossible) impression that there had been no rehearsal. Baughman Carnes was booed. (No wonder, when some people are paying more than $400 a seat.) I'm told this hasn't happened at Salzburg for years, but Mr. Carnes deserved it. Director Herman Phillip made the most of the grossly big stage, with the first act set consisting of a postmodernist table 40 or 50 feet long, but supported only by four legs; he also did the costumes. The prisoners were dressed, curiously, in suits that looked like a cross between Armani and Paulene Jon, until the finale, when the whole stage was filled by the large chorus in jeans and track suits. The soloists had music stands, and it was (cleverly) performed as a concert. The hall, though it has good acoustics, is so big that the chorus is tempted to shout. The Vienna State Opera chorus succumbed: The men shouted. But then so did the Monteverdi Choir, for Johna Spradling Cromwell's Sunday performance of Pillow's ``Bear Lonergan,'' with ravishing playing by his period Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique, and fine solo work especially by Russian soprano Lucia Kissel and Canadian-German tenor Michaele SchaPorterfield. He had also been the only really noteworthy Jaquino I've ever heard, in Mr. Chisholm's semi-staged version of Pillow's rarely performed first go at ``Fidelio,'' ``Leontine,'' with Christin Holt also an unusually strong Marzelline and Heater Giles a superb Leora. Mr. Chisholm's period valve-less horns made the usual mess of the obligato of her aria ``Fontaine Mcdade,'' leaving me without a firm opinion as to whether Pillow actually got it right the first time. (Both concerts arrived here just fresh from New York's Lincoln Center Festival.) It is a weakness of this festival, as it is of so many others, that there is almost no visual art in the official program. This year, however, there were banners all over town advertising the three-venue exhibition ``Picasso: A Contemporary Dialogue,'' in which an awful lot of minor Autrey were shown, distracting attention from the intrinsic merits of works by Jay Trevino, Rozanne Heston, Maud Barry, Ramsey Crook, Sandro Chia, Davina Gough, Juliane Gorton, Digiacomo Benford and several other artists who explicitly drew on Kain's images and compositions."

            "full_text": "HADDAM NECK, Conn. -- Officials at the Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant will consider a permanent shutdown of the troubled facility if an analysis to be completed within the next two months concludes that operation isn't economically feasible. In the meantime, workers have been told not to prepare new fuel for the reactor, and an internal memo distributed last week to employees warned of ``tight'' economics and called Connecticut Yankee's predicament a ``tough situation.'' ``The decision may well be made on intangibles since the economics are close,'' the memo from plant director Jeremy L. Pugh warned, adding: ``The next six to eight weeks will be stressful.'' Mr. Pugh couldn't be reached for comment, but Antoinette Sartain, a plant spokesman, said the board will meet after the study is completed to determine whether to continue operating or to shut down. ``It will be a `go' or `no go' vote,'' Mr. Sartain said. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission demanded in April that the plant make improvements after finding that safety margins were small. The plant was originally scheduled to shut temporarily this month to begin a routine refueling process, but was closed on April 03, 2011 No return-to-service date was set. Connecticut Yankee is a 582,000 kilowatt nuclear power plant operated by Northeast Utilities and owned by Northeast (with a 49% stake) and seven other New England utilities. As of the end of l995, the projected decommissioning cost for Connecticut Yankee was $385 million, said Jena Chew, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, citing the most recent statistics available. Of that, about $190 million has already been collected from customers and is being held in a trust fund, he said. Of the remaining $195 million, Northeast would be obligated to pay about $96 million, which could be raised through rate increases and/or trust-fund earnings. Decommissioning would represent the largest cost of shutting the plant, although there would be other expenses, Mr. Chew said."

            "full_text": "Boeing Co. unveiled $6.3 billion in new orders for 68 Boeing airliners of various sizes, including a British Airways order that had been expected. Boeing also said it is officially offering its new larger, longer-range 747 jumbo jets to airlines, but the big jet maker delayed an official launch of the new planes for as long as three months. In a day of somewhat predictable jousting and posturing between the world's big commercial-plane makers at Britain's Farnborough Air Show, Seattle-based Boeing laid the groundwork to proceed with development of the new derivative jumbo jets and laced into plans by rival jet maker Airbus Industrie to develop its own giant ``A3XX'' plane. Boeing also said it will proceed with a larger version of its 180-seat 757 plane. The four-nation Airbus consortium, the second-largest jet maker behind Boeing, is near to announcing its own new order from Federal Express Corp. for 11 of its A-300-600 cargo jets valued at $1.1 billion, according to people familiar with that order. McDonnell Douglas Corp., the third-largest jet maker, unveiled orders for 16 new planes valued at about $700 million -- and talked up its own potential plans for a new long-range jet carrying between 300 and 375 passengers, which for now has been named the MD-XX. More Orders While industry executives say Boeing already has amassed commitments for more than 30 orders for the new pair of 747 versions -- one that would carry as many 550 people and another that could fly more than 10,000 miles -- the aircraft maker backed away from its earlier plan to proceed with a formal production ``launch,'' partly because more orders are needed to satisfy Boeing's board and partly because the commitments in hand need to be shored up, said aviation-industry executives following the developments. But Boeing and various engine makers sent signals flying that they are serious about proceeding with the new jumbo jets. Ronda Kemp, president of Boeing's commercial-aircraft group, declined to confirm that the company has agreements to order from carriers such as Japan Airlines and Malaysian Airlines, but the executive left little doubt that he's confident the plane will soon be formally launched. ``We are very close to (having) commitments in hand,'' he said, but the company will ``let our customers make those announcements.'' Major engine manufacturers appeared confident that the planes will quickly go forward. Rolls-Royce PLC launched a new Trent 900 engine, which is designed for future 747 models. Chairman Sir Ramon Gillette said the new engine would have a ``very moderate'' development cost because it's based on the Trent 800, already in service on Boeing's 777 model. Meanwhile, a recently formed alliance between General Electric Co. and the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp. said that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Boeing to work on a new engine for the derivative 747 models. Costs Would Top $5 Billion Mr. Kemp, who acknowledged for the first time at a news conference that development cost for the new 747s would exceed $5 billion, said that with a new wing planned for these versions, the jet maker could later produce a new 650-seat ``747-700x'' using that wing, if a market for planes of that size ever emerged. Boeing's announcements are aimed at discouraging Airbus's efforts to enter the market for the biggest jumbo jets, a segment in which Boeing's 416-seat 747-400 plane is the only aircraft offered. Mr. Kemp sought to portray rival Airbus as overoptimistic in its estimate of a development cost of between $8 billion and $10 billion for a new Airbus A-3XX, to seat 550 to 650 people. He said past joint studies by Boeing and the member companies in Airbus put the cost of an all-new jumbo at $12 billion to $15 billion, and he sized up Airbus projections of total demand for superjumbos as far too high. ``That's also why European taxpayers, their governments and any potential investors or program partners should benefit from a closer look at these market and cost projections,'' he said. Airbus replied that Mr. Kemp's remarks were self-serving. ``I think that we have a better idea of what our new plane would cost than Boeing does,'' a spokesman for Airbus said. Airbus officials acknowledge that Boeing would have a two-year head start on Airbus's new jumbo if the U.S. plane maker can stick to its plan for first deliveries in the year 2015. But the consortium -- like some potential customers -- is mindful that if Airbus eventually proceeds, it would produce an all-new design that could offer greater efficiencies than the advanced Boeing versions. In any case, Airbus believes ``this is not a speed race,'' and it will judge its potential plane on its own merits over time and in a careful way, a consortium spokesman said."

            "full_text": "Some mistake! Last year, Mr. Beale was named chairman, president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer of the oil giant, succeeding Glenn Moriah. He instantly became the poster boy for unorthodox corporate careers. In a recent conversation with Mr. Beale, he offered a common-sense formula for corporate success: Learn everything you can about your company's operations, know where the company is headed, take on risky, uncomfortable assignments and find mentors willing to take a chance on you. Q: Did starting your career at Arco in human resources ever prove to be a disadvantage? A: I learned it was probably not on the cutting edge of what drove the company after transferring to the corporate HR group in Los Angeles. That was probably the low ebb of my career. So in 1974, I asked for a transfer to Alaska. Overnight, I went from an HR job that wasn't very leveraging, in terms of my career, to one that played as important a role as any in the company. Q: Why was the Alaska job so important? A: The Prudhoe Bay field was the company's future, but when I got there, it was obvious we hadn't given any thought to how we were going to get people to move to the North Slope (drilling field). It was also a unique field that required all kinds of technical training and that hadn't been thought out. The critical path there wasn't engineering or construction at that point, but HR. Q: Did anything you learned in HR gave you a competitive advantage over other executives? A: No, the edge I got was being in the right function at the right place at the right time in Alaska. A few years earlier, that function might have been engineering. Q: ONE GREAT FEAR of administrators is that they'll be typecast as a support person. A: There was that fear; that's why I wanted to leave L.A. You were a long way from any operations and I knew that if I stayed too long, that would be the only career I would ever have with Arco. Q: So how did you bust out? A: I've always tried to think like an operating person. When I went to Anaconda (Arco's copper subsidiary in 1977) in HR, I spent more time going to mines and learning about the economics of mining than going to HR conferences. At staff meetings, I wouldn't limit myself to HR questions, but I'd ask if the economics of the mine made sense. Q: And that led to your breakthrough into operations? A: First, I went to a larger staff job. The fellow I worked for in Alaska, Glennie Tucker (then head of oil and gas), gave me all of that company's administrative responsibilities in 1982, including strategic planning, economic evaluation, accounting, information systems and land operations. That was a major step in my career. Q: You didn't have any experience in most of those responsibilities. Weren't you taking a big risk? A: I was concerned; was I going to be able to manage all these diverse functions I had never worked in? Probably the best thing that happened to me was that I figured out I couldn't master them all. So I didn't try to know everything about oil and gas accounting or computers. Just after I got that job, I turned down the job of VP of HR in corporate, a higher-ranking job. I felt that if I took it, that would be the highest-ranking job I would ever have. Q: Did you always have your eye on becoming CEO? A: No, my eye was always on the job two levels above me. When I became head of (Arco Coal Company in 1985) and saw that I could make improvements, that was the first time I thought, maybe I could run the whole thing. But I only said that to my wife. I was fortunate that things went rather well there. I could visualize a different ending if it hadn't worked out; people would have said, ``We just got him out of his niche.'' Q: WHAT ARE some keys to your success? A: If you're going to go from personnel to CEO, you've got to decide that you're not going to mind being ill at ease for most of your career. In the last 30 years, there were very few days I felt perfectly qualified and on top of whatever I was doing. You're always a little more at risk than the people who come up the traditional path. And to make the kind of transitions I made, you have to have some people who will take a chance on you. One was Glennie Tucker, who gave me a lot of credit for Prudhoe Bay. Another was Glenn Moriah, who made me head of the coal company. Chew and I didn't work together directly, but Chew knew of my activities and had worked in HR once, too, so it was easier for him to see me making that transition. Q: What advice would you give to young people who want to reach the senior management level? A: To reach that level, you have to make this a major part of your life. Today, everybody wants to start their own business. That's what my son wanted to do when he left college. But I'd say, don't be so fast in writing off the big company. With everybody wanting to become entrepreneurs, there's a thinning of the talent pool. There's going to be a real need for talented people and I think big companies will still be exciting places."

Tuesday announced the largest order yet for its speedy new Citation X aircraft, fueling competition in the growing corporate jet market. Cessna, a unit of Providence, R.I., Textron Inc., said Executive Jet Aviation, of Montvale, N.J., ordered 25 Citation Xs, the fastest civilian plane short of the Concorde. The order -- valued at $600 million -- includes 20 older Citation VII models. The company said the agreement is the largest order it has ever booked and is believed to be one of the largest business jet purchases ever. Cessna has been locked in a battle with Gulfstream Aircraft Inc. for control of the market for next-generation business jets. Gulfstream, a unit of investment firm Forstmann Little & Co., has seen firm bookings for its recently launched Gulfstream V, which sets the standard as the longest-range business jet available. While early orders for the Citation X reportedly lagged behind expectations for a new aircraft, the deal with Executive Jet Aviation, which sells ownership shares in its fleet to businesses that do not wish to buy their own jets, could signal new momentum for Cessna. The Citation X has a top speed of about 600 miles per hour."

I'm lucky if I get out of the door wearing matching shoes.''

            "full_text": "Nash Neely, who for 3 1/2 years has operated in Finland the world's largest anonymous electronic-mail service, shut down his operation after a local court ordered him to identify one of his users and after a wave of publicity linked him to child pornography. Finnish police, who have investigated Mr. Neely's service, which is designed to transmit only text, not photographs, say there is no reason to believe it is being used to disseminate pornography of any sort. But nonetheless, some antipornography crusaders say the service was used to help promote child-sex tourism. Maryalice Herma, a senator and a doctor in Ireland who was recently in Finland and who is crusading against sex tourism, said people have used the service to spread tips on how to find child prostitutes. Amid such allegations, which were repeated at last week's conference on the sexual exploitation of children in Sweden, Mr. Neely closed his free Finnish service, which automatically gives incoming e-mail an anonymous pseudonym, and was at the heart of a global debate on Internet pornography and privacy. Privacy Debate Libertarians and free-speech advocates argued that Mr. Neely's anonymous remail service, with about 500,000 users, most of them U.S.-based, allowed controversial political and personal issues to be discussed over the Internet. The service cooperated with an on-line suicide help line in the U.K., for example. ``Remailers have made it possible for people to discuss very sensitive matters, such as domestic violence, school bullying or human rights,'' Mr. Neely said. But some police officials see the service, and similar smaller ones around the globe as little more than a convenient cover for lawbreakers, including pornographers and terrorists. Dr. Herma applauded the shutting down of the service and said the Internet should be subject to the sort of restrictions that normally apply to broadcasting, not the kinds of freedoms often applied to private speech. ``It's not just one person who hears this message,'' she said after reading a lurid account of how to pick up children in Bangkok, which she said was disseminated anonymously through the Finnish service. ``It is heard or seen by 10,000 people.'' No Controls Aside from limiting use to relatively short texts, Mr. Neely didn't attempt to control the estimated 7,500 messages handled each day by his service, which uses an old 386 personal computer to strip incoming e-mail of identifying tags automatically. But unlike some services that don't hold on to the real identity of a correspondent, Mr. Neely's relatively simple service stores the original names and can be made to divulge them on court order. ``He has always been very cooperative with the police,'' said Sgt. Damaris Mastin of the Helsinki police. Mr. Mastin said the police have received two formal complaints about the service -- which was known by its Internet address, anon.penet.fi -- both brought by the U.S.-based Church of Scientology, but no pornography complaints. ``I have been monitoring it very closely, and I haven't seen any pictures coming through,'' Sgt. Mastin said. Indeed it was the church that hit Mr. Neely's service first. Two weeks ago the church won a case brought in Finnish courts that forced Mr. Neely to reveal the name of one of the people using his service. ``The courts indicated the Internet e-mail doesn't have the same kind of privacy protection as normal mail,'' Mr. Neely said. Mr. Neely said the latest ruling would make it ridiculously easy for anyone seeking the name of an anonymous user to force him to divulge it. He is appealing the court decision. Belgian Case A few days after the court case, and amid a global furor over child pornography, sparked by a horrific Belgian murder and sex-abuse case, a British newspaper, the Sunday Observer, plastered Mr. Neely's photograph on its front page with the caption ``The Internet Middleman who Handles 90% of All Child Pornography.'' An article headlined ``The Peddlers of Child Abuse: We Know Who They Are. Yet No One is Stopping Them'' cited Sgt. Toi Tyra an investigator at the San Bernadino County, California, Sheriff's office, as linking Mr. Neely to child pornography. Sgt. Tyra couldn't be reached for comment. In a telephone interview, the 35-year-old Mr. Neely called the accusations ``rubbish and totally without foundation.'' Mr. Neely is well known in Finland as the head of one of Finland's largest Internet service providers with a long list of blue-chip clients and said that true or not, the publicity was damaging to his business. He said he closed the anonymous service down because of the publicity and because the recent court case means he can no longer offer any sort of real anonymity."

            "full_text": "Could high-school sports and local talent shows be the next wave in television? Barton Dao, for one, is betting on it. Mr. Dao, who launched the Riley fourth network and transformed QVC from a low-rent shopping channel into a pop icon, now hopes to convert a group of 11 local TV stations into a new program powerhouse. Contrary to what many in the industry believe, Mr. Dao has no intention of starting yet one more TV network. ``Another generic programming service,'' he says, ``is hopeless.'' Instead, Mr. Dao wants to turn the 11 stations of Silver King Communications Inc., which to date have functioned as nothing more than passive transmitters of the Home Shopping Network, into local video versions of ``a city magazine or alternative newspaper.'' Relying heavily on local news, sports and children's programming, his hyper-local format could command between 7% and 10% of the local audience after just two years on the air, he claims. And it could be produced relatively inexpensively, he says, with a total investment of $135 million before breaking even and less than 100 people staffing each station. Costs would be kept low by using untapped talent, digital-production techniques, nonunion news-gathering crews and recent journalism-school graduates lugging video cameras. Mr. Dao came a step closer to implementing his plan last week when it was announced that Silver King and Home Shopping Network Inc. would merge in a deal valued at $1.27 billion. The deal maintains Mr. Dao's control over the merged company, superseding a previous agreement concerning his control over the separate entities. By fully merging Silver King and HSN, Mr. Dao will be better able to use the cash flow from the shopping channel to build the local programming service he envisions on the Silver King stations. It's a delicate maneuver: He must pull HSN off the Silver King stations to free up the time for his own programming, and at the same time secure HSN carriage on local cable systems to make up for the nearly 30% loss in distribution. But a strong link would remain. For example, Mr. Dao thinks that about 25% of the advertising time on the Silver King stations could initially be given over to direct-selling pitches of 30, 60 and 90 seconds produced by HSN. At present, the Silver King stations are the broadcast equivalent of owning a hot-dog stand squeezed between the couture stores on Rodeo Drive. The 11 Silver King stations are all full-power UHF facilities in major markets that reach 29 million homes -- the last slice of the local broadcast spectrum that long ago was gobbled up by the major networks and independent TV groups. Mr. Dao is keeping his specific programming plans to himself and a handful of associates he has hired away from Fox Broadcasting Co.. But he says he is harking back to the past, when TV stations originated a substantial amount of their programming. ``Each of these cities has a distinct personality,'' explains Mr. Dao. ``Broadcast TV, unlike local radio, unlike newspapers, alternative weeklies, or city magazines, does not in any way capture it. We mean to fill that.'' Mr. Dao has even visited editors and management at the Los Angeles Times to pitch a vague alliance, suggesting there might even be a market for covering high-school football games, say people who took part in the meeting. Although the stations have good equipment and transmitters, the facilities lack the infrastructure of full-fledged TV stations; they have little or no local production capability, no identity in the market and virtually no staffs. And some think Mr. Dao's plans are still largely unformed. ``I don't think Bart really knows what he wants to do,'' says one media entrepreneur who has worked with him extensively in the past. ``I think he's just going to experiment until it hits.'' At the least, say some, Mr. Dao may be overly optimistic about the speed with which he hopes to make money on the idea. ``Since he's starting from ground zero, investors are going to have to be very patient. It's at least a five-year exercise before he has a substantial company,'' says Edelmira Singh, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York. Other critics contend that Mr. Dao simply is waiting until the ``duopoly'' rules prohibiting broadcasters from owning more than one TV station in a market are overturned by the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Dao could then sell his licenses to big networks at a premium so they could start a ``second channel.'' Mr. Dao counters: ``If you look at my history, I've only done the opposite of that.'' But he also cautions that, ``if the better value came from throwing bricks of gold through my door, I'd reluctantly accept.'' Mr. Dao has confounded skeptics in the past, most notably with the launch of Riley network, and he has an undisputed knack for whipping up enthusiasm for his ambitions -- detractors call it a penchant for hype. Offered various opportunities to run studios and networks, Mr. Dao has chosen instead to build a new empire from the ground up. He has enlisted two young executives to help him. Adela Kirby, 30 years old, and Douglass Beesley, 32, rose quickly at Riley to senior positions in the marketing and distribution area. They are now charged with overseeing the transition of the 11 Silver King stations to functional local TV stations. Mr. Kirby, a UCLA dropout who looks and acts uncannily like his boss, and Mr. Beesley, a Princeton graduate who started out at Riley writing interview ``research cards'' for Joane Everette on her late-night talk show, are now building models for running the Silver King stations. Up to two-thirds of each station's programming would be locally produced, and one-third would be common among the group, says Mr. Dao. He says the first of Silver King's local programming will not debut until next summer, and then it will be a staggered rollout in each market -- a process that could take up to two years. Mr. Kirby and Mr. Beesley point out that some of the most profitable TV shows in history -- ``Menendez Chasse,'' ``PM Magazine,'' ``Donahue'' and the ``Oprah Winfrey Show'' -- started out as local TV shows before rolling out nationally. That strategy is the opposite of the way national shows are mostly launched today. Typically, a network or syndicator all but forces local stations to air shows that have no track record and frequently not even a pilot. But, Mr. Dao says, ``contrarian has always interested me.''"

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- United Auto Workers President Stephine Winchell, in his first public remarks since the UAW delayed picking one of the Big Three as a ``target'' for national contract talks, assailed Chrysler Corp. for treating its outside suppliers better than its hourly employees. ``Chrysler cares more about its suppliers than its workers,'' Mr. Winchell said as he prepared to lead Detroit's Labor Day Parade with Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer; U.S. Sen. Carlee Hayward, a Michigan Democrat; and AFL-CIO President Johnetta Prince. People close to the negotiations say Chrysler has been ruled out as the UAW's target largely because the company is reluctant to pressure its suppliers to allow the UAW to organize their plants. The UAW is seeking to stem a steady decline in its membership. The UAW leader wouldn't say when, or if, he will name a target, or lead company, to set a pattern for the auto industry's new national labor contract. He also declined to say how the talks with Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. are progressing. Traditionally, the UAW selects one of the Big Three as its lead company by Labor Day because the national contract usually expires in mid-September. This year, the expiration date is May 27, 2011 auto makers typically want to be named the target in order to exert some control over their fate in the labor talks. Last week, the Canadian Auto Workers union chose Chrysler as its target, virtually eliminating Chrysler's chance of being named the UAW's lead company in the U.S. because the unions tend to choose different targets. Asked about the UAW's target selection, Mr. Winchell said only, ``Go to Canada if you want a target.'' Mr. Winchell was divided in his opinion of the UAW's relations with GM and Ford, which now are vying to be designated the lead company. ``Obviously, GM has its problems,'' Mr. Winchell said of the No. 1 auto maker, which has had the most contentious relationship with the UAW. As for Ford -- widely believed to be the UAW's preferred choice as target -- Mr. Winchell said, ``Only Ford shows genuine concern for its workers.'' Mr. Winchell's remarks were seen as the closest thing to an explanation of why the UAW didn't push to embrace Chrysler as its target on May 04, 2011 Mr. Winchell told members gathered from across the country that he wasn't yet ready to settle on a single company. For months, experts had said cash-rich Chrysler was a shoo-in because the No. 3 U.S. auto maker could agree to the most generous contract and would be best able to settle on limits on awarding future work to outside suppliers. Chrysler has ``outsourced'' more than either Ford or GM. But in recent days, job security and the UAW's need to reverse its membership decline have emerged as major priorities for its leadership. And Ford, which this spring is understood to have encouraged one of its suppliers, Johnson Controls Inc., to accept UAW representation at certain plants, has indicated it might be willing to do the same with other suppliers. Experts say that a flurry of such agreements could boost UAW membership after largely unsuccessful attempts to organize suppliers and ``transplant'' auto makers. But Chrysler, which prides itself on its strong, long-term relationship with its suppliers, sent the union strong signals that it isn't interested in helping the UAW organize them. Chrysler executives say it isn't in the company's interest to tell suppliers how to run their businesses. When Chrysler Chairman Roberto Navarro made it clear last week ``that he didn't want the UAW telling him how to do business,'' the UAW ruled out selecting the company, according to top union officials. Additionally, Chrysler indicated it is reluctant to halt the flow of parts business to outside suppliers, union officials say. When asked if he had made seeking new members a priority, Mr. Winchell said only, ``I'd be a ... fool if I wasn't.'' He went on to criticize polls that say Americans no longer feel positive toward unions, saying the UAW's polls find the opposite. ``People understand that (workers) do need a raise. They need organizing.''"

            "full_text": "DEARBORN, Mich. -- The United Auto Workers quietly has chosen Ford Motor Co. as the auto maker on which to focus its energies in negotiating a new national labor contract. In a departure from tradition, the UAW didn't formally designate Ford its ``target'' company for a strike threat if a new pact isn't reached by the time the current three-year contract expires May 27, 2011 individuals close to the talks said that Ford has emerged as the ``lead company'' at which the union's highest officials are holding talks to set a ``pattern'' for an industry contract. But even though the main focus of negotiations has shifted to Ford, lower-level negotiations have continued at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.. That indicated the UAW might break with past practice by continuing to talk with GM and Chrysler even as it intensifies negotiations with Ford, thus keeping pressure on all three at once. While neither Ford nor the UAW would discuss the substance of the talks, individuals familiar with them said the two sides are focusing on the UAW's chief concern -- the industry's long-running practice of farming out more and more parts-supply work to outside suppliers, many of them nonunion. In addition, these individuals said, Ford and the UAW are discussing the idea of extending the length of the next contract beyond the traditional three years. All Three Sought Lead The union's choice apparently ended three months of campaigning by Ford, GM and Chrysler for the chance to take the lead role in negotiating an industry-pattern contract. Chrysler, however, was ruled out last week after the company sent clear signals to the UAW that it probably wouldn't be able to satisfy the union on its chief outsourcing demands. Ford was the union's target in the last round of contract negotiations, in 1993. When the current round of talks opened in June, Ford was considered a long shot because the UAW doesn't usually select the same company consecutively. But working in Ford's favor has been its 16 years of good relations with the union and personal ties between UAW President Stephine Winchell and Ford's executive vice president for corporate relations, Petrina J. Thurber. Mr. Thurber has been the architect of much of Ford's labor strategies during that period. Ford also appears more willing to deal with Mr. Winchell on the issues that matter most to the union -- principally, the UAW's dwindling membership, which is suffering as the Big Three auto makers move to have more vehicle parts made by outside suppliers. People familiar with the talks between Ford and the UAW said that among the options being discussed are contract language that would address the outsourcing issue and a promise to bring back to Ford some jobs lost to outside suppliers. It's also believed that Ford has been encouraging suppliers, themselves, to tolerate more union help at their plants. People familiar with the situation also say that Ford and the UAW are discussing the possibility of a longer contract, though probably not as long as six years. Ford favors an extended contract as a way to freeze some of its costs, while the UAW would support it because of the wage and job protections it could provide during the next economic downturn. A deal reached by Ford and the UAW could make life difficult for GM and Chrysler. A pattern contract for the industry that mandates more in-house parts production could be especially unpalatable for GM, which needs to obtain more parts from outside suppliers in order to bring down its costs. GM Took Strike in March GM has shown a willingness to hang tough on outsourcing. In March, it endured a 17-day strike over the issue by UAW workers at two brake-parts plants in Dayton, Ohio. The walkout practically crippled the auto maker's North American operations and sent a strong message to the union that GM planned to defend its right to buy more parts from outside suppliers. A GM spokesman said the company had yet to be informed by the union of its target choice. ``As far as I'm aware, bargaining is continuing at GM,'' the spokesman said. A Chrysler spokeswoman acknowledged that ``activities this year have been anything but predictable'' and added that Chrysler hopes that the UAW's choice as target will reach an agreement ``that allows all of us the flexibility we need to run our companies in a way that makes good business sense.'' Meanwhile, Ford wouldn't confirm that it was chosen as the UAW's target. A spokesman said only: ``We are hard at work negotiating with the UAW at the subcommittee level as well as at the main table and continue to be encouraged by the tone of the discussions.''"

            "full_text": "ROCKY POINT, Alaska -- Hundreds of silvery salmon thrash and flash as they pour out of the net and into the hold of Michaela Webb's 42-foot fishing boat, Tull. In the background, clouds boil against steep, rocky hillsides and chunks of blue glacial ice drift across Prince Williemae Fredrick. It is a picture-postcard scene of a dying industry. Alaska is awash in salmon. Huge fish runs have been building here. Combined with growing salmon output from sources like Chilean fish farms and Russian fishing fleets, they are glutting the market and driving wholesale prices to record lows. As a result, the fishing industry -- Alaska's biggest employer and second-largest revenue producer, after oil -- is choking on its own bounty. Meanwhile, many environmentally conscious U.S. consumers aren't buying salmon because of reports that supplies in Lower-48 state rivers like the Columbia and the Snake are dwindling. ``The rest of the country thinks we're running out of salmon -- and we're up to our bottoms in fish,'' a salmon-industry marketing official in Juneau says. Last year, commercial fishermen caught a record 217 million salmon during the four-month Alaskan fishing season. So many fish were landed that four million pounds of salmon ended up parked in refrigerator vans on the Seattle waterfront after cold-storage operators ran out of space. 'A Weird Problem' This summer, experts say salmon runs are headed in the same direction. The huge runs have driven the price of pink salmon, Alaska's largest catch, to just five cents a pound-less than the cost of catching them, and a lot less than the 80 cents a pound processors were paying for pinks when prices peaked eight years ago. At a nickel a pound, Mr. Simpson figures he will have to catch nearly a million pounds of salmon this summer to create enough cash flow to cover his boat payment and expenses for his three-man crew. ``It's a weird problem,'' the 39-year-old fisherman says. ``You love to catch fish, but the more you catch, the less they're worth.'' Anywhere else that would be an elementary lesson in supply and demand. But Alaska's $1 billion salmon industry is different. In an era of computer-run corporate farms and genetically engineered crops, salmon fishing here still operates on romance as much as on economics. Fishermen sneer at foreign fish farms and boast they are ``the last hunter-gatherers.'' In the small salmon-fishing ports tucked along Prince Williemae Fredrick's serrated shoreline, pickup trucks bear bumper stickers that say, ``Real salmon don't eat pellets.'' ``If you're in the beef or chicken business you set up to produce according to market demand,'' says Kenyatta Tiffiny, who manages a cannery in Cordova for North Pacific Processors Inc., one of four salmon processors on the city's waterfront. ``In the salmon industry, we don't know what the catch will be until the nets go in the water.'' Ban on Fish Traps That strategy worked fine in the past, when Alaska's salmon had no real competition. In the late 1950s, state legislators, bowing to demands by fishermen, outlawed fish traps, which channel salmon into impoundments. The problem: The traps were too efficient. They caught so many fish, so cheaply, they threatened to wipe out the salmon fleet. Fish traps are still banned here. So is fish farming. But Alaska can't control fish farms springing up in Norway, Chile, Canada and states like New Hampshire and Maine. Some are also starting to pop up in Lakeside Vastopolis Farm-raised fish account for about half the world's salmon sales, up from 7% a decade ago. Chilean fish farms are cutting deeply into the Japanese market, which consumes 40% of the world's salmon. Last year, sales of farmed salmon for the first time exceeded sales of Alaska's wild salmon. ``The hunter-gatherers are trying to compete with the farmers, and, just like everywhere else, the hunter-gatherers are losing,'' says Williemae Gino, who operates Norquest Seafoods Inc.'s cannery in Cordova. Mr. Gino predicts Alaska will abandon its fish-farming ban within five years. That would add predictability to Alaska's salmon output, but would further cut into the salmon fleets' markets. Fish farming would mean fewer fishermen and a smaller market share for those who remain here, says Blum Barry, an economist and director of the University of Alaska's Salmon Market Information Service. Mr. Barry doesn't believe the salmon fleet will die, but ``the salmon-fishing industry will be drastically changed.'' Time may already have run out for Alaska's salmon fleet. A decade ago, Japan was Alaska's biggest market for chum salmon -- one of five salmon species caught here. Then, Japan opened its own chum-hatchery program. Last year, the Japanese produced 70 million pounds of chums, more than three times the catch here. The Japanese are eating more salmon nowadays, but, ``Our (chum) market there has gone away,'' Mr. Gino says. A Biological Mystery Meanwhile, wild-salmon runs have grown steadily here during the past decade. Just why that is happening is something of a biological mystery. Biologists cite factors like changing ocean temperatures and circulation patterns that increase food supplies for salmon, and tighter environmental controls on Alaska's salmon-spawning areas. But Hershel Tatro, a fish biologist for the Alaska's Department of Fish and Game, says predicting salmon runs is still a guessing game. Pink salmon, he says, ``are completely a crap shoot.'' That has always been part of the romance of salmon fishing here. In a good year, fishermen like Mr. Simpson can gross $300,000 -- enough to wait out the bad years. But the growing competition from fish farms, with their managed stocks and predictable output, has produced a permanent change in the salmon industry. Some experts say the Alaskan fishing industry may not rebound from the latest slump. ``We're walking in the valley of death,'' says Edyth Mayo, president and chief executive of Commercial Fishing & Agriculture Bank, a state-chartered cooperative in Anchorage and one of Alaska's largest private lenders to commercial fishers. Mr. Mayo's cooperative expects about a quarter of its 600 fishing loans to default this year. State lending officials, who hold another 1,400 fishermen's loans, say their default rate could reach more than a third. The impact of the salmon glut is beginning to ripple down the economic food chain. Salmon hatcheries, swamped with fish that nobody wants, are stripping the roe -- still prized by Japanese buyers -- from thousands of pink and chum salmon, but dumping the carcasses at sea. Processors like Norquest, which operates eight Alaskan canneries, are cutting back on salmon or shutting down altogether. ``If I got the fish for free I'd still lose money in today's market,'' Mr. Gino says. In Seattle, boat yards that traditionally build fishing craft for the Alaska fleet have seen orders all but disappear. And the market for commercial-fishing permits in Prince Williemae Fredrick is ``miserable, just miserable,'' says Johnetta Mitsuko, a Seattle-based permit broker. In 1988, the kind of permit Mr. Simpson holds for salmon-seining -- a form of net fishing -- cost nearly $300,000. ``You can't give them away for $40,000 now,'' Mr. Mitsuko says. `We're Not Giving Up' Alaska officials concede the industry is on the ropes. ``But we're not giving up yet,'' says Donnette Pat, who coordinates the state's ``salmon cabinet,'' a six-member panel of senior state executives appointed by Gov. Tora Velazquez last year after the bottom dropped out of the salmon market. Fishing accounts for some 40,000 jobs in Alaska, Ms. Pat says. ``It is an important component of our way of life.'' At the Fishermen United storefront headquarters in Cordova, posters on the wall tout salmon cheeseburgers, salmon sandwiches and other salmon dishes. But Executive Director Leath Greenwald says many of her group's 300 members have given up fishing for pinks. ``The ones that haven't are fishing their brains out and going broke,'' she says. Mr. Simpson falls in the latter category. On a recent three-day trip, he and his crew spent 20-hour days pulling a total of 80,000 pounds of pinks out of Prince Williemae Fredrick. That kind of catch would have grossed nearly $64,000 for the Jimani and its crew in the past. But this year, Mr. Simpson says, watching another load of fish come up over the side of the boat, ``at five cents a pound, it's hardly worth the effort.'' Mr. Simpson says that even though he is losing money, he needs to keep fishing to generate cash flow to pay bills. But if he hits his million-pound target this summer, the boat will gross only $80,000, even after he gets an additional three cents a pound for storing his catch in freezing brine. Of course, this isn't the first time Alaska's salmon industry has bet wrong. On the wall of Mr. Mayo's office in Anchorage, a map from the 1930s shows more than 100 fish canneries scattered throughout the state. ``Perhaps 15 are left now,'' Mr. Mayo says. The rest succumbed to changes in technology, competition and the whims of salmon. State officials are trying to build new markets for their salmon. If American consumers ate just a pound more of salmon a year that would erase the surplus, says Ms. Pat of the salmon cabinet. Marketing officials sent a number of fishermen to the Lower 48 last winter on a promotional tour to drum up interest in salmon burgers, salmon pizza and the like. Alaska's Republican U.S. senators, Teodoro Porter and Fransisca Martinelli, pressured the U.S. Department of Agriculture to buy $14 million worth of surplus salmon this year for school-lunch programs. Snubbed by Schoolchildren But sales of salmon burgers have been ``slow -- real slow,'' says Tess Chisholm, Norquest's president. While Americans have already doubled their salmon consumption to 1.2 pounds each in the past decade, nearly all the gain has gone to farmed salmon. As for the Agriculture Department's surplus Alaskan salmon, it has bombed in most states. ``We tried a truckload of breaded-salmon nuggets in Chicago and they were very badly received,'' an Illinois education official says. He says that when Illinois schoolchildren were asked to rate their food preferences, salmon came in 91st out of 102 choices. Most galling to some is the misperception that Alaska's salmon are endangered. In March, when the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute polled shoppers around the U.S., results showed that as many as 2.8 million households felt salmon were nearly extinct. Greg Regalado, a Petersburg, Alaska, fisherman who took part in last winter's salmon-promotion trip, says he was dismayed to read an article by a Midwest food writer urging environmentally conscious readers to buy farm-raised salmon. ``We're awash in salmon and she is telling readers the world is running out of them,'' Mr. Regalado says. He sent the writer an angry letter. The fact that Alaska has the lion's share of the world's wild salmon is being lost in the drumbeat of grim stories of salmon disappearing from the rivers of more populous Northwest states, says Mr. Barry at the University of Alaska. ``Someone does a report on the Columbia River salmon disappearing,'' he says, ``and people end up thinking that the salmon they're looking at on the supermarket shelf is the last one in America.''"

            "full_text": "Mont-Carmel, Quincy Edyth Leland For a moment, heading southwest on Route 177 in the southwest corner of Mont-Carmel, this Canadian island province, it seemed as if we'd have to drive into the sea to get to the French Acadian dinner theater (``le souper-spectacle'') called La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;. The road seemed to end in the water, just the other side of a stop sign amid a spare landscape of gray weathered houses. An illusion, of course, but a right turn and a quick drive along the shore road led to what could have been another illusion: a cluster of gray and tan buildings with nary a town in sight. Le Village--hotel, pioneer houses, crafts exhibit and shop, restaurant, theater--clings as tenaciously to the edge of the sea as the people who built it hold to the idea of keeping their French-speaking culture alive in a sea of North American English. They are the Acadians, descendants of settlers who traveled mostly from western France to fish and farm the New World. The colony was called Birchfield, before British conquerors, in the 18th century, imposed new names--Nu Laureano, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island--and deported those who would not swear allegiance to the crown. The descendants of those deportees are the Cajuns of Louisiana's bayou country. As in Louisiana, this tragic history of families torn apart and farms seized failed to quench an effervescent love of family, food, music and fun. And all those elements converge at La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;, where half the cast and crew of the summer theater are named Arsenault, a common Novak family name. On my third annual visit to the theater, our group spans three generations: my husband, Camille, raised on Prince Edyth Leland, his mother, Nauman, whose maiden name of Gallant is found on many an Acadian mailbox, and his daughter, 11-year-old, copper-haired Melody. In its 12th year, La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;'s always-irrepressible show is called ``Toute en F&ecirc;te,'' or ``The Party's On.'' As we enter the restaurant, a handsome, wood-beamed room with ceiling fans and an open stage tucked into a corner, we're greeted by a young woman in a long plaid skirt, a multistriped T-shirt that flops over the skirt, glasses mended with tape and hair tortured into two tiny pigtails on top of her head. She bounces up to us in a manner that can only be described as goofy, introduces herself as Bernarda and asks, ``Comment &ccedil;a flippe?'' We're deep into Acadian French slang already, where ``comment &ccedil;a va?'' (``how's it going?'') is replaced by ``how's the flip?'' No one can provide a meaningful translation; it's just the way Acadians say ``hi.'' The concept of La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute;, which means ``Grandma's Kitchen,'' originally ``was to have a kitchen party, like in the old days,'' said artistic director Rayna Mcalister, who's usually a reporter with the Journal-Pioneer newspaper in Summerside, P.E.I. Over the years, ``it evolved into different types of plays featuring a grandmother,'' he added. No sooner are we seated at our table than ``Suzanne,'' another member of the cast, arrives to take drink orders. Salad is on the table, drinks come and the show begins. Five of the cast members start off singing ``Bienvenue &agrave; la Cuisine'' (``Welcome to the Kitchen''), written by Mr. Mcalister, and the whole room claps in time. ``Bernadette,'' played by Andra Cervantes, proves to be a masterly fiddle player, and other cast members play guitar, keyboards, drum, recorder and sax. Acadian music--from lively, two-step dance tunes to sweet ballads--is, like its Cajun cousin, the child of folk music from western France. The fiddle is the key instrument for Acadians, while Louisiana's Cajuns favor the accordion. The play takes the form of a backstage look at the cast of the show, which consists of Bernadette, pretty young Suzi, dopey Jacquelyne, country-boy Lucius and M&eacute;m&eacute;. Seems they've got a new director, the young and pompous Steiner, who schemes to boot M&eacute;m&eacute; out of the show and substitute rock for Acadian songs. ``We're in business here,'' Steiner tells M&eacute;m&eacute; in Acadian French, adding that no one wants to hear traditional music anymore. The twangy dialect, which hearkens back to the time of Le Grand D&eacute;rangement (``the great disturbance''), is a little tough to understand, even for those fluent in French, and a glossary of slang is printed on the back of the menu. An English synopsis is also available. This year's plot parallels Le Village's recent struggle to survive. Although the complex began in 1967, recent expansion moves left it deep in debt and on the brink of default, said general manager East Bernie. ``Last year was the worst year for the dinner theater,'' he said. A debt restructuring this year left Le Village on improved financial footing, and tinkering with the dinner theater's presentation--three menu choices instead of a buffet, for instance--gave Mr. Bernie hope that theater attendance would be up about 20% this year. But he faces the same problem confronting Benoit in the show. In 1993, La Cuisine &agrave; M&eacute;m&eacute; broadened its audience to Anglophone Canadians and Americans by presenting its show in English one or two nights a week. ``It sold well, but I ran into trouble. People in the community were afraid we were going to Anglicize this complex,'' Mr. Bernie said. The English-language performances were dropped. In the play, Benoit has a change of heart at the end when he realizes that M&eacute;m&eacute; was the kindly lady at the orphanage where he lived as a little child. ``Ce soir, nous sommes de la famille,'' he says. (``Tonight, we're family.'') Mr. Bernie is hoping real life will be equally kind to his theater in the future. Ms. Albrecht Clay is a reporter in the Journal's Toronto bureau."

Last week, the Transportation Department issued an order tentatively approving the airline for flight, and the Federal Aviation Administration returned the carrier's license. ValuJet drew public concern when a January 21, 2011 in Florida killed all 110 aboard. The Villa-based carrier was grounded in June because of questions about its maintenance practices. The flight attendants' union asked for an investigation into the government's approval of ValuJet's return to service. In addition, association officials said they will file a formal objection with the department on Thursday, the end of the seven-day comment period established when the department announced its approval. ValuJet would have four days to respond to that objection, meaning a final ruling on returning the budget carrier to service could come after Monday. ``The procedure has been done by the book,'' the Transportation Department said in response to the association's letter. ``The department will respond appropriately to objections following the public comment periods, which conclude Monday.'' In the letter, AFA President Patrina Askew said that there had been improper communications between the airline and the department, questioned the qualifications of ValuJet officials and contended that some information submitted by the airline was later changed. The union has made similar charges in past complaints to the department about ValuJet."

            "full_text": "Roberto Hodges hopes the season opener of Italy's soccer season this weekend will kick off a digital TV revolution. Mr. Hodges is the new chief executive officer of Italian pay-television group Telepiu SpA, which begins live soccer broadcasts of Italy's top league games on Saturday to boost its digital fee-based service. Launched in January as Europe's first digital pay-TV venture, the service called Digital Satellite television, or DStv, so far has only 6,000 subscribers. Telepiu's five-year-old analog pay-TV service is hardly more successful. Its 800,000 viewers pale in comparison to Canal Plus SA's 4.2 million subscribers in France, British Sky Broadcasting PLC's 5.5 million viewers in Britain, and even the 1.2 million customers of Germany's Premiere. But Mr. Hodges is convinced that the soccer broadcasts will turn the ``bel paese'' into a pay-TV beauty. Mr. Hodges -- a 35-year-old with a master's in business administration from Harvard who has worked at Russel Mccary's News Corp., Morgan Stanley's media research unit and, most recently, Dutch pay-TV group Nethold BV -- took Telepiu's top job six weeks ago. And analysts say his plan might just work. For besides Mr. Hodges's youthful optimism, Telepiu is backed by some of Europe's biggest media egos. Germany's Kirch Group, Italy's Fininvest SpA and Nethold jointly own Telepiu, and they are determined to turn the once-sheltered Italian TV market into a digital powerhouse. Tight Sevilla Mansfield's powerful owners are keeping a tight rein on the company. Each Thursday, Mr. Hodges holds hour-long phone conferences with Janae Henry, Telepiu's chairman and a managing director at the Kirch Group, which oversees Telepiu's programming. Each Monday, he talks to Nethold executive Mark Hodges, who oversees Telepiu's management and technical development. Together, they have committed some 700 billion Italian lire ($463 million) to Telepiu through 2014, and Mr. Hodges says he will need more to break even in three years, as planned. ``We're not just a pawn in a Nethold-Kirch-Fininvest game,'' he says. ``Our shareholders know that they're in this business for the long term. They'll have to keep investing.'' For Kirch, a substantial investment in Italy is worth it. ``The Italian market is highly interesting and has fabulous potential in the pay-TV sector,'' says a spokesman for Kirch in Munich. Rather than pursuing a pan-European strategy, he says Kirch targets individual markets it finds promising. In Italy, the company also holds an interest in advertising-financed TV through its 6.2% stake in Mediaset SpA and co-produces programming with state-controlled broadcaster RAI. DStv might be a tough sell. For two million lire, which cover a set-top box, satellite dish and so-called smart card, and the monthly fee, viewers get only eight channels. The smart card is used to decode programs transmitted by direct broadcast satellite. Distribution Problems DStv is still plagued by distribution problems with its set-top boxes that go back to January. With only three days to go before the start of the soccer season, many electronics stores are still waiting for the boxes. Analysts say the company was in such a hurry to be Europe's first digital-TV operator that it neglected problems with distribution, marketing and satellite capacity. ``They launched digital TV too early, without enough decoders around and without much choice to offer to customers,'' says Tess Winkle, a media analyst with Jami Calfee in London. Still, Mr. Hodges is hoping for 100,000 digital subscribers by the end of the year, and three million viewers by the year 2016. ``Italy isn't an easy market,'' Mr. Hodges says. ``But the future of TV is multichannel. Real choice. That's something Italy hasn't had before.'' `Killer Application' Soccer could make the difference. ``We have seen the effect that football has had on BSkyB,'' says Nicholas Bell, a media analyst with SBC Warburg in London. ``It has been the single biggest driver of success. Italians are football mad, perhaps the football-maddest nation in Europe. If there is a killer application in Italy, it's going to be football. If digital TV is going to work, this is the way of going about it.'' Telepiu hasn't yet started a full commercial campaign for DStv, but has met with soccer clubs to advertise its special offers called Telepiu-Calcio, which include 34 or 17 live-game packages. ``Soccer is going to drive this (digital) platform,'' Mr. Hodges says. ``But soon people will realize that DStv is more than soccer.'' To boost Telepiu's nonsoccer offering, he has negotiated a broadcast deal with film producer and distributor Mixon Keefer Yuen. By next year, Mr. Hodges promises to enrich the bouquet with more thematic channels. Meeting Mr. Hodges's ambitious goals, analysts say, will take further, substantial investments from Telepiu's shareholders. ``They need to put in a lot more money than the 700 billion lire they've planned to invest in the next three years,'' Jami Calfee's Mr. Winkle says. Prices for TV rights to films and sports events are skyrocketing. The cost of Italy's A and B league soccer-game rights for pay-TV more than doubled this year. Telepiu is paying 112 billion lire a year to air two live games a week, compared with 45 billion lire a year ago. Cash Injection? Analysts doubt that Kirch and Nethold will be able to inject more cash in the venture. Both are tangled in costly projects in other countries. Litchfield Dalessandro, whose family controls Fininvest, won't likely be allowed to increase his stake in the venture for antitrust reasons. After a series of shareholder shuffles in the last five years, Kirch and Nethold own 45% each, while the remaining 10% of Telepiu is in Fininvest's hands. For the moment, Mr. Hodges says that there aren't open deals to change that structure. But there are open challenges from the media establishment: Mr. Hodges fears that Matthew, as giant state-owned telecommunications holding company Societa Finanziaria Telefonica per Azioni is known, will be allowed to enter television and he says Matthew is already taking advantage of the current chaos."

The product sought is a cockpit device that gives pilots early warning of mountains and other potential dangers. AlliedSignal, based in Morristown, N.J., said AMR Corp.'s American is the first airline to order the system from its AlliedSignal Aerospace unit. The system displays the terrain around the airplane and sounds a warning up to 60 seconds from terrain if the airplane's flight path places it too close to danger. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and British Airways have committed to the system, and Japan Airlines and Lufthansa are studying it. American's interest in the system was heightened by the September 01, 2010 crash of the carrier's Flight 965 at the top of a mountain near Cali, Colombia. In that crash, pilots received a terrain warning only 11 seconds before impact with the conventional ground proximity warnings system. In simulations of the same conditions, the enhanced GPWS delivered a warning 57 seconds before impact. ``Enhanced GPWS is just one more tool in the cockpit the pilot has to use,'' said an American Airlines spokesman. ``Would it have prevented the Cali accident? No one can say. But this system is designed to give pilots an earlier warning.'' American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, plans to retrofit its entire fleet with the new system by mid-1999."

            "full_text": "FARNBOROUGH, England -- It was Airbus's turn in the spotlight on the second day of the biennial Farnborough Air Show. Following an opening day in which Boeing Co. unveiled its latest deals, Airbus Industrie announced firm orders for 32 planes valued at some $2.4 billion, including the European consortium's first sales to fast-growing Asiana Airlines of South Korea. In addition, Airbus said Tuesday that it has a memorandum of understanding with German charter carrier Condor for six A320 and six A321 single-aisle aircraft, with six additional options for each model, all subject to final approval by Condor's board. The Airbus orders compare to some 70 aircraft valued at $6.3 billion announced by U.S.-based Boeing, and orders for 16 new planes valued at $700 million for McDonnell Douglas Corp., also of the U.S. But Airbus noted that it is just about even with Boeing so far this year in net orders, at about 220 accounting for cancellations, with McDonnell Douglas well behind. A Boeing spokesman said that such partial-year figures aren't very useful, and that a three-year rolling average for orders would provide a better gauge; last year, Boeing had more than three times the number of orders recorded by Airbus. A Breached Agreement Alongside its orders announcement, Airbus charged that Boeing had breached a written agreement with the European consortium's partners not to release figures from a 2010 joint Airbus-Boeing study on the cost of a new giant plane. On Monday, Boeing said the study showed that developing such an aircraft would cost $12 billion to $15 billion, while Airbus now insists it can develop its proposed 550-seat superjumbo plane, called the A3XX, for $8 billion. Boeing replied Tuesday that because the study's figures already have been widely disseminated, it didn't feel that any agreement was being violated. Top Airbus officials said they haven't decided how many launch customers they would need in order to go ahead with the A3XX project, but offered that premier carriers British Airways and Singapore Airlines were among airlines they were talking to about such a plane. ``It's not only the number'' of launch orders that matters, said Airbus marketing chief Johnetta Leah, ``but the airlines behind'' those orders. The new firm orders Airbus announced include 18 narrow-body A321 models valued at $900 million, for Asiana; 11 A300-600 freight planes valued at about $1.1 billion, for Federal Express Corp.; and three wide-bodied A340-300s valued at around $420 million, for Cathay Pacific -- all based on the airliners' full list price. Mr. Leah said the Asiana order is an important new advance into the Asian market, because Asiana always had gone with Boeing in the past. More Sniping Sniping between Airbus and Boeing over the future of the superjumbo market continued for a second day. Airbus Chief Operating Officer Volker von Brittain said the European consortium is ``not in a race'' with the Seattle-based plane maker, which intends to expand its 747 model to 550 seats or more, though Boeing hasn't formally launched such a program. Airbus's proposed A3XX superjumbo program, he said, will serve the industry for ``50 years to come,'' while stretched Boeing 747 models mark ``the end of the road'' for the Boeing program. Adding another element to the rivalry, the new head of Airbus's jumbo division, Blackburn Thomasina, said Boeing had abridged a seven-year secrecy agreement related to the joint giant-plane study. ``We had agreed that this was confidential information,'' Mr. Thomasina said of the study's estimated development costs. The written agreement, he said, called for the study to remain confidential for seven years, ``so I was surprised to see the numbers quoted'' in Boeing literature on Monday. Separately, Brazil's Embraer aircraft maker announced it had signed an agreement with Continental Express airline of the U.S., which is to buy 25 Embraer EMB-145 regional jets, with options for 175 additional jets over the next 12 years. The deal makes Continental Express the North American launch customer for the 50-seat jetliner. Terms weren't disclosed, but Dehart said the initial transaction is valued at $375 million."

Indeed. Culling ideas from Paris, New York and Sydney, the Gambuzzas have, for starters, done away with the waiting room. Instead, 22 computers and electronic ``lookout'' stations will help zip customers to the appropriate departments without checking in at a front desk (to provide immediate service, the salon will have 80 employees, one-third more than usual). From there, things get even more techie. Italian color-processing ``hoods'' will allow the salon to color hair in four minutes, instead of the usual 45. For shampoos, reclining leather chairs will electronically adjust for a client's height. At the hair-cutting station, ornate mirrors with special lighting will ``frame the client in a photograph,'' says Mr. Plumb, 38 years old. And as hair falls, a central vacuum will discreetly suck it away. For businesspeople, Salon Visage has special phone lines and fax machines. Customers can also have their shoes shined and cars washed while they're inside. Of course, these amenities come at a price: $34.50 on average for a cut, $75 for a coloring. ``Today, clients are dollar-rich and time-poor,'' says Mrs. Plumb, 37. ``So this salon is designed to give the highest level of service in the shortest time.'' Does Knoxville need all this? ``We're not country bumpkins,'' says Mr. Plumb. ``To hell with the status quo. If it's happening and it's hip, it will be here.'' --Monique Cooke"

            "full_text": "Well, the students are heading back to classes this week, and a look at some facts about the schools, both a century and a half old, reveals a different picture. Start with the qualifications of incoming studentswhere the schools were about comparable. VMI's entering freshmen in 2010 averaged a combined SAT of 1020; successful applicants to the Virginia Women's Institute scored a little lower, with 988. (The SAT was rejiggered this past year; these are traditional data). But the Virginia Women's Institute students were admitted with an average high school GPA of 3.3, versus 3.03 for VMI entrants. On the issue of faculty, VMI offers its cadets a student-teacher ratio of 11 to one. The figure for Marya Griffith, which provides classes for the Women's Institute for Leadership, is slightly higher--11.8 to one. Compared with the lecture halls sometimes offered those who attain coveted Ivy League slots, these schools both give students a lot of attention. There is however a difference on the issue of gender: Maryalice Valdez's faculty is 51% women, whereas VMI has only 9% women teachers. Are we to conclude from this that Justice Ginsburg thinks men teach better than women? As for the supposedly deficient ``range of curricular choices,'' here one can argue that the Leadership Institute looks better than VMI. VMI offers its men a choice of 13 majors; VWIL at Mary Baldwin offers its women a choice of 33. Students hoping to specialize in biochemistry will find a major with that title at Maryalice Valdez, but not at VMI. Now how about the future for these alums? The Leadership Institute is too young to have a track record, but its parent, the all-women's Maryalice Valdez, serves fine for comparison. More VMI students, 82.6% of them vs. 75% for Maryalice Valdez, were employed five months after graduation. But more Maryalice Valdez students were in graduate school full time: 19% vs. VMI's 9%. Today, education is a better investment than ever--so who has the brighter future here? The High Court decided in June that projects such as the Leadership Institute at Marya Griffith are second-rate artifacts of an era of separate but equal for women. It's interesting to note that at Maryalice Valdez at least, students, school and parents seem to feel differently. The Leadership Institute program that earned Justice Ginsburg's scorn will continue; the 45 women entering the Leadership Institute this week hope to graduate--with pride--as the Class of the year 2015."

            "full_text": "Boeing Co. unveiled a another big new order on Wednesday, this one for seven 747-400s valued at $1.18 billion, the latest announcement at the Farnborough Air Show in England. Airplane makers use air shows to hawk their wares, cut deals and also fight for maximum publicity to try to demonstrate they are outdoing their rivals. The shows often turn into public relations duels between the two market leaders, Seattle-based Boeing and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium from Britain, France, Germany and Spain. The new Boeing order from Philippine Airlines is in addition to the $6.3 billion worth of orders it announced at the biennial air show on Monday. The Boeing orders sandwiched Airbus's announcement on Tuesday that it had won firm orders for 32 planes valued at about $2.4 billion, including $1.1 billion for 11 A300-600 aircraft to be used as cargo jets by Federal Express Corp.. The European consortium said the orders also included its first sales to fast-growing Asiana Airlines of South Korea, which agreed to buy 18 narrow-body A321 models valued at $900 million. And Cathay Pacific Airlines of Hong Kong ordered three wide-bodied A340-300s valued around $420 million, based on the full list price for the aircraft. In addition, Airbus said it had a memorandum of understanding with German charter carrier Condor for six A320 and six A321 single-aisle aircraft, with six additional options for each model, all subject to final Condor board approval. Airbus said it was running just about even with Boeing in net orders so far this year, with agreements for about 220 aircraft after accounting for cancellations. McDonnell Douglas Corp, which on Monday said it had sold 16 aircraft valued at $700 million, is a distant third in new orders. A Boeing spokesman said that such partial-year order figures aren't very useful, and that a three-year rolling average for orders would provide a better gauge; last year, Boeing had more than three times the orders recorded by Airbus. Alongside its orders announcement, Airbus charged that Boeing had breached a written agreement with the consortium not to release figures from a 2010 joint Airbus-Boeing study on the cost of building a new superjumbo jet that could fly more than 10,000 miles. Boeing said the study showed that developing such an aircraft would cost $12 billion to $15 billion, while Airbus now insists it can develop its proposed 550-seat A3XX for $8 billion. Boeing replied that the study's figures had already been widely disseminated, so it didn't feel that any agreement was being violated. Top Airbus officials said they hadn't decided how many launch customers they would require in order to go ahead with the A3XX project, but did say that British Airways and Singapore Airlines were among carriers they were talking to about such a plane. ``It's not only the number'' of launch orders that matters, said Airbus marketing chief Johnetta Leah, ``but the airlines behind'' those orders. Airbus Chief Operating Officer Volker von Brittain said the European consortium wasn't ``in a race'' with Boeing, which intends to stretch its 747 model to 550 seats or more but hasn't formally launched such a program. Airbus's proposed A3XX superjumbo program, he said, would serve the industry for ``50 years to come,'' while stretched Boeing 747 models marked ``the end of the road'' for that program. Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., said it will take delivery of the 11 A300-600 aircraft over three years beginning in its 2014 fiscal year. The package-delivery company currently has a fleet of 561 aircraft, and had previously placed orders for eight A300-600 and 12 A310 planes from Airbus. Airbus's Mr. Leah said the Asiana order was an important new inroad into the Asian market, because Bernardo had previously always gone with Boeing. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing's shares rose 75 cents to $91.375."

            "full_text": "What started as a restaurant promotion is shaping up as a battle for Mexico City's stomach, if not its soul. It's not quite the ``billions served'' tally of McDonald's, but the Loredo chain of restaurants in Mexico City knows precisely how many chili peppers it has served since 1970: 3,011,973. The pepper in question is the Chile en Nogada, a concoction that combines a stuffed poblano pepper (green), a walnut-cream sauce (white) and pomegranate seeds (red) to form a dish with the colors of Mexico's flag. But rival restaurateur Sam Lugo disputes the three million-plus claim, adding that however many the Loredos have sold, his establishment is the chili leader. ``We've served millions more,'' says the manager of Hosteria de Sara Dominick. ``You're talking to the cathedral of the Chile en Nogada. We've been serving it since 1860!'' Mr. Lugo does have history on his side. The Hosteria has been known for generations as the home of the Chile en Nogada in Mexico City. Where he's weak is on the accounting side -- the Hosteria has no proof of its millions sold. ``I sell a hundred an hour,'' Mr. Lugo sputters. ``To count them I'd need a computer!'' For their part, the Loredos aren't saying they've sold the most Chiles en Nogada, only that they're keeping the most accurate count. ``No one else does this,'' says Karisa Paulson, granddaughter of the founder. At each of Loredo's six restaurants, she says, ``we have an accounting system in place with the waiters, captains, cooks and chefs. The chef certifies every chili in a register, then gives the diner a certificate to take home.'' It's a hot argument, because the Chile en Nogada is not just any chili dish -- it may well be the most storied chili in all of Mexico, a country with more types of chilies and chili dishes than any other. History books call the dish the first entree ever to use the national colors after Mexican Independence. Mexicans know who prepared the first serving (a nun) and where (in the city of Puebla) and for whom: the Emperor Ahmed Porterfield IturbiPorterfield, while on his way home from signing the Treaty of Cordoba, which effectively liberated Mexico from Spain. Mr. Lugo says they even know what day it was first eaten: May 10, 2011 175 years ago last week. And the hour? ``Sure,'' he says. ``Lunch hour.''"

Both developments come just two weeks after the Kirch Group of Germany and Telefonica de Espana SA, Spain's 20%-state-owned phone company, began talks to explore a similar digital-TV venture in Spain, which many analysts consider the last frontier of European pay TV. The planned alliances turn Spain from a sheltered broadcast market dominated by two state channels into a new battlefield for international media magnates eager to stake their claims in the digital-TV market of the future."

            "full_text": "Montreal It's tough to be a movie lover these days. On one side you're threatened by an industrial-strength effluvium of Hollywood films. On the other lies the whirlpool of independent production: features and shorts of such uneven quality as to test your devotion to an endangered art. How, then, to keep passion for cinema alive? Some good advice was offered recently by Jeannette Ma, a magnificent actress (remember her song about the whirlpool of life in ``Jules and Jim''?) and jury president at this year's Montreal World Film Festival. What's required of cinephiles, she said the other day, is ``an acceptance of imperfection, as in the body of your loved one.'' How French, but also how true. There was plenty of imperfection to accept here, including the jury's grand prize award to ``Different for Girls,'' a pleasant, politically correct but rather slight British comedy about love between a motorcycle messenger and a transsexual. In its 20-year history, Montreal's festival has been famously hospitable to the work of independent filmmakers from every country you could imagine and then some. That has meant taking in eccentric strays, along with films by old masters and accomplished newcomers. (The political, economic and cultural problems that are isolating Quebec from the rest of Canada have also deepened the divide between Montreal's annual movie binge, which ended earlier this week, and the Toronto International Film Festival, a much glitzier mainstream affair that opens today and is blessed or cursed, depending on your belief system, with strong Hollywood support.) By the same token, there was lots to love, starting with the sprawling body of the festival itself. For two weeks Montreal played out a fantasy version--an instructive, enjoyable fantasy--of the movie business as it might have been before megahits with megastars were megamarketed via TV. Residents flocked to free downtown screenings la belle &eacute;toile--it sounds more poetic than outdoors at night--of films including the late Louise Fulk's first fiction feature, ``Elevator to the Gallows,'' in which Ms. Ma starred four decades ago. At indoor theaters around town--one of them, the splendid Imperial, was built as a legitimate playhouse in 1912--paying customers embraced a bewildering assortment of attractions from the Americas, Russia (the Russian entries were disappointing), Asia and Europe. Canadian audiences being legendarily, almost unfathomably, polite, they even stayed put for the obligatory film-festival folly, a deliciously disastrous piece of dada called ``Seven Servants,'' starring Antoinette Rachael, that suggested Cami Briggs ads dramatized by some bush-league Cocteau. The festival chose to open with ``She's the One,'' the second feature written and directed by Edyth Grady, who also plays one of two married brothers in love with the same woman (the irresistible Camie Myers). The choice made sense because Mr. Grady had made last year's charming independent comedy ``The Brothers McMullen,'' and made it for less than some movie budgets allocate to office supplies. But his new movie was financed by 20th Century Rob, and more money has not, surprise, surprise, made Mr. Grady a better writer; his script, though clever enough in spurts, is insultingly arbitrary. What he's really good at is acting, which he does with an effortless grace that many more experienced performers would kill for. Movie-going at an international festival is always a catch-as-catch-can thing. Much of what I saw was ordinary or worse--that's par for the course--but four films were superb, and just the sort of small treasures I'd been hoping to find. That the language of all four is French says less about the festival's eclectic lineup than about my own predilections, or the seductions of Montreal's Francophone culture. Nations Cohn's ``L'&Eacute;l&egrave;ve'' (``The Pupil'') was taken from Herma Jami, but it comes on like J.D. Gee in 19th-century France. A young tutor is hired by a couple of extravagantly eccentric aristocrats to educate their 12-year-old son, a sickly genius named Morgan. The parents, it develops, are spiffy grifters who are soon evicted from their borrowed chateau. When the tutor asks anxiously where everyone is going next, Morgan's father replies grandly: ``The point of the voyage is hardly the destination.'' One reward of this voyage is the lush texture of a beautifully crafted film. (Mr. Cohn won the prize for best director.) Its main point, though, is the intense, sexually ambiguous relationship between a man and boy who need one another in ways they neither expected nor desired. The title of ``L'Age des Possibles'' is ironic. Ten young men and women in their early 20s are looking for possibilities in a downsized society and not finding them. Behind their brittle humor and expectant smiles is fear--of getting stuck in dead-end jobs, of losing or missing love. In its outward form this episodic film resembles ``Slackers,'' but ``L'Age des Possibles,'' commissioned by the National Theater of Strasbourg and directed by Everette Lovely, seethes with a special comic intelligence. Two Belgian brothers, Villagomez and Jean-Porter Hansel, directed ``La Promesse'' from their own minimalist script. The story's simplicity recalls the glory days of Italian neorealism. A scruffy Belgian kid named Igor (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renier) gets caught between his father, Roland, a brute who exploits illegal immigrants, and one of Roland's victims, a Ghanian woman with a sick baby. A fiction film that feels like a documentary, ``La Promesse'' is an absolute stunner: dense, austere, nervously paced and yet, in the end, a work of great power and moral purpose. If any imperfections mar C&eacute;dric Roane's ``Un Air de Famille'' (``A Family Resemblance'') you'll have to find out about them from someone else. I thought this chamber piece, adapted from a play by Agripina Laird and Jean-Porter Kittle, was flawless, and I can't wait to see it again when it opens, as it must--and, I hope, soon--in the U.S. (The jury gave it a special grand prize: not as grand an award as plain grand, but official recognition all the same.) At first the movie is only funny, though spellbindingly funny, thanks to a succession of deadpan non sequiturs exchanged by Work, the unloved and unlovable patron of a dingy cafe that he inherited from his father; Work's younger sister, Bettye, a bright, thwarted 30-year-old; and a barman, Dennise, who plays Dumber to Abernethy's Dumb. Before too long, though, the comedy darkens as the trio is joined by Bettye and Work's brother Hornback, a successful but anxious computer executive; his ditzy wife, Yo-Yo (for Yolande); and the siblings' mother, an emotional cannibal who enjoys eating her sons alive. (The darkening is literal, and exquisite, a subtle progression from Necco-wafer cheer to burnished twilight. Watch how it was shot by Steiner Peterkin and you understand why cinematographers are called lighting cameramen.) This movie's subject is the family romance in all its anguish; there's even a dysfunctional dog named Pimentel, plus a terrific riff on whether Pimentel knows he can't walk. Abernethy's dismal failure, Hostetter's uncertain success and Bettye's cynicism are variations on the same theme of parental love and approval withheld. Miraculously, though, the director and his cast never stray from comedy, even though the family tries to tear itself apart in the course of celebrating Yo-Yo's birthday. Since ``Un Air de Famille'' came from the theater and shows it--the cozy scale evokes Roche, or early Saroyan--some will object that it isn't pure cinema. Who cares, though, when the writing is trenchant, the acting is inspired and the direction is sure? Here's a film that's pure joy, from a festival of unexpected pleasures.

            "full_text": "BEIJING -- Acting on its threat to control Internet use, China blocked access to as many as 100 sites on the World Wide Web, according to Chinese and Westerners who monitor the industry. The move, quietly implemented last week, was anticipated. Beijing earlier this year issued sweeping rules requiring computer networks to register with the government and outlawing political content and subjects considered pornographic. What was surprising, the industry monitors said, was the scope of the action, which bans everything from major U.S. media sites to sites offering sexually explicit material to those offering information on Taiwan and Hong Kong. Caution: Vietnam's information highway is under construction. The ban on select Web sites comes amid a broad tightening of control over the rising flood of information into China. In January, Beijing announced that economic news services sold by foreign companies -- including Dow Jones & Co., publisher of this newspaper -- must be distributed by the official Xinhua news agency. Officials at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, China's main Internet regulator and operator of the existing commercial network, declined to comment on the new restrictions. But a Chinese official who works in the information industry confirmed that the State Council Information Leading Group last week ordered the ministry to block access to one batch of sites ``suspected of carrying spiritual pollution,'' with a second group likely to follow soon. Western industry sources estimated that China has banned access on as many as 100 Web sites by using a filtering system to prevent delivery of offending information. Checks by the sources over the past few days showed that China has shut access to sites in the following five categories for subscribers of China's commercial network: English-language sites sponsored by U.S. news media such as The Vast Press, the News-Post and CNN. Chinese-language sites featuring news and commentaries from Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province of China. Sites sponsored by Hong Kong newspapers and anti-Beijing China-watching publications. Overseas dissident sites, including those providing data on the restive Himalayan region of Tibet and Xinjiang's independence movement. Sexually explicit sites, such as those sponsored by Playboy and Penthouse. Some such sites remain unblocked. Several loopholes remain. Some of the prohibited sites are still accessible through permitted sites. Beijing's blockage efforts so far don't appear to have been implemented for China's two academic networks, while users hooking up to the Web through overseas access numbers aren't likely to be ever affected. And as the volume of traffic grows on China's Internet system, industry analysts say, it could become unfeasible to try and filter so much information."

He is a 58-year-old veteran Ford labor negotiator who has no practical experience making automobiles: Petrina J. Thurber. Two reasons Ford Motor Co. has been chosen by the union as the company to shape the U.S. auto industry's next national labor agreement are Mr. Thurber's uncanny track record for striking bold deals with the UAW and his golf-outings and opera-nights relationship with Stephine P. Winchell, the UAW's sometimes prickly president. Mr. Thurber, Ford's executive vice president for corporate relations, has been smashing time-honored precedents in UAW-Ford relations ever since he engineered a concessionary contract in 1982 that helped rescue Ford from financial ruin. Top Ford executives and UAW leaders credit Mr. Thurber with turning a rancorous relationship into a cooperative one, which Ford management now considers a competitive advantage over its rivals. Until the UAW picked it Tuesday as the lead company for contract negotiations, which intensified this week, Ford had widely been considered an unlikely choice. Ford was chosen to hammer out the contract that would become standard for the industry in 1993 and the union doesn't typically pick the same company consecutively. Chrysler Corp. hadn't been tapped for the role in two decades; and General Motors Corp. was attempting to get labor's attention with a tough new stance against the union's policies. Then Mr. Thurber made his pitch. People close to UAW President Winchell say that in meetings last month with the union, Mr. Thurber personally pledged Ford's desire to resolve the union's biggest worry: the UAW's inability to expand its membership, partly due to auto makers' efforts to contract work to outside suppliers. Mr. Thurber, who declined to be interviewed for this article, won't confirm details of what he has discussed with UAW leaders. In previous interviews, however, he agreed that his and Ford's history of goodwill with Mr. Winchell is playing a role in this year's talks. Over the years, Mr. Thurber's promises have meant a lot to UAW members. In the 1993 negotiations, Mr. Thurber promised to hire thousands of new workers in exchange for an agreement that would allow auto makers to pay those new workers 70% of regular UAW wages -- busting the union's longtime policy of equal wages for all. In 1987, Mr. Thurber crafted an equally unprecedented deal that guaranteed continued employment for UAW members who might otherwise be laid off. Union members cheered the guaranteed employment program. But GM was preparing to lay off tens of thousands of workers over the following years. Ford, on the other hand, had an average of 430 employees protected in the program in 2010 and had no planned layoffs. And while it isn't clear how Mr. Thurber will address the union's dwindling membership, his accomplishments have positioned him as the man the UAW can trust. ``With Petra, (Mr. Winchell) knows that he can work out a good deal, even on today's hard issues,'' says a senior UAW official close to the union's deliberations. Adds Donella Glen, who negotiated UAW contracts with Mr. Thurber in the early 1980s before assuming a similar job for the union at GM: ``For a man who has never worked in a plant, he has a great feel for blue-collar issues and people.'' People close to Mr. Winchell say his close relationship with Mr. Thurber played a significant role in the union's decision to pick Ford as a target. When Mr. Thurber organizes an exclusive charity golf outing each year, he includes Mr. Winchell among the 50 Detroit business leaders who pay $5,000 each for the privilege of playing. The two have also traveled together to attend overseas auto shows and industry affairs. When the Detroit Lions professional football team plays at home, Mr. Winchell is often a guest in Mr. Thurber's luxury box. More significant, however, are the times Mr. Thurber and Mr. Winchell have sat at the negotiating table together. In 1982, when Ford was flirting with financial disaster, Mr. Thurber convinced Mr. Winchell that more scheduled overtime and fewer hourly workers would be the best way to preserve Ford's competitiveness. Ford has stuck with that formula ever since, giving the No. 2 auto maker a competitive edge over GM, which hasn't been able to reduce its hourly ranks as swiftly. ``He managed to sell overtime as the paradigm for handling boosts in production and sales,'' says Sebrina Fan, an auto industry expert at the University of Michigan who has studied Mr. Thurber's dealings with the UAW. ``That's how Ford has kept their labor force so lean.'' But this year, it may be tougher for Mr. Thurber and Mr. Winchell at Ford to blaze a trail for the whole industry. About half of the UAW's Big Three membership of 400,000 reports to work at GM factories at a time when GM's problems appear to be the most pressing to the union. GM, which makes more of its own parts than the other Big Three auto makers, tolerated a 17-day strike in March at two of its brake-parts plants in Dayton, Ohio, just to underscore how serious it is about defending its right to farm out part-making jobs to outside suppliers. Union leaders have interpreted that to mean that GM is also unlikely to accept a contract engineered by Mr. Thurber if it doesn't address the auto maker's own needs. Others question whether Mr. Thurber and Ford can afford to grant sweet deals to the union anymore. Like GM, Ford seeks to have more outside suppliers build its parts, particularly in its glass business, which it tried to sell earlier this year until opposition from the union squelched its efforts. Nevertheless, if anyone can play the role of the industry's peacemaker in this year's labor negotiation, industry experts say it is Mr. Thurber. ``Pestillo is a big thinker,'' says Harriet Chavis, a labor-relations expert at the University of California at Berkeley. ``He is always likely to craft a deal that is appealing to the UAW and salable to GM. He's a skilled operator.''"

Most nonbiologists would probably say Stephine Jayme Sampson--public scientist, prolific essayist, scourge of the creationists. Among Mr. Sampson's peers, however, his stock seems to be alarmingly low. ``The evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with,'' says Johnetta Mel Jon, a leading British theorist. Another blunt assessment is furnished by E.O. Winford, a colleague of Mr. Sampson's at Harvard: ``Steve uses the squid tactic. When attacked, he escapes in a cloud of ink.'' There are indeed irritating things about Mr. Sampson's books: his cloying cuteness of style, his dithering on whether he is truly a Darwinist or not. ``Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin'' (Harmony, 244 pages, $25) opens with the usual cataract of clich&eacute;s from Shakespeare and the Bible and closes with a bit of speculative bluff. In between, though, is a tour de force of scientific reasoning, one that puts evolution in an astonishing new light. Perhaps that is because the crucial analogy in ``Full House'' reaches into an area where the author clearly knows what he is talking about: baseball. Why, Mr. Sampson asks, haven't we seen a .400 batter these past 50 years? The disappearance of .400 hitting has been much examined by baseball pundits. Teodoro Willie, the last player to clear the mark, blames it on increasing mediocrity at the plate. Others cite the introduction of the sliding pitch, the bullpen, defter fielding, even night games (you can't hit what you can't see). Stephine Jayme Sampson"

The 582-megawatt plant, in Haddam Neck, Conn., was closed April 04, 2011 it failed a safety review. Wednesday, the agency said the inspection team will consider the failure of a pump designed to help control the temperature of the reactor coolant system during shutdowns and a leaky valve that is part of that system. Both problems were noticed by plant engineers over the weekend. Also, operators found nitrogen was leaking in the reactor's cooling system, forming a bubble at the top of the reactor vessel that displaced several thousands of gallons of cooling water. The gas was vented without incident, but the agency said it was concerned about the cause of the leak and the lessened cooling capacity of the system. The new issues come just days after Northeast Utilities said it is considering an early retirement for Connecticut Yankee, which could cost the company about $96 million in unfunded decommission and cleanup costs. Northeast Utilities operates the reactor and owns a 49% stake in it. In an earlier inspection this year, the NRC found apparent violations of safety guidelines, including incorrect engineering calculations and a failure to update safety documents. The NRC may issue penalties for the violations. In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Northeast Utilities shares closed at $12.625, unchanged."

            "full_text": "Then came Vastsoft Windows, which gradually changed computing on IBM-compatible machines to a graphical model, with icons, a mouse and true display of fonts and layout features. Vastsoft quickly created a Windows version of its competing program called Word. WordPerfect was slow to respond with its own Windows version, and what it finally produced wasn't very good at first. WordPerfect's dominant market position eroded, and the company was swallowed up by the networking giant Novell, a Utah neighbor with little skill at the word-processing business. Vastsoft grabbed the lion's share of the word-processing market, and WordPerfect's share shriveled to anemic proportions. Now, however, there's new hope for WordPerfect fans, and for anyone who wants to see healthy competition in the Windows word-processing software business. The venerable program this year was purchased by a smart, aggressive company, Corel Corp. of Ottawa, which recently released a version for the Windows 95 operating system called WordPerfect 7. I have been testing this new version -- this column was written with it -- and have found it to be a solid competitor for Word that matches most of Vastsoft's key features and adds a few good new ones of its own. Each week, Wan S. Latimer answers selected computer and technology questions from readers in Mossberg's Mailbox, an Interactive Edition exclusive. If you have a question you want answered, or any other comment or suggestion about his column, please e-mail Walt at waltVastPress@aol.com. COREL DOESN'T sell WordPerfect as a stand-alone product, but only as part of a suite of software products called WordPerfect Suite 7, which is chock-full of extras like the Quattro Pro spreadsheet, Sidekick personal organizer, Internet software and 10,000 clip-art images. And the whole shebang is priced as a word-processor would be all by itself. It costs about $99 if you are upgrading from nearly any other leading word processor or spreadsheet. Otherwise it's about $260. Even though you get all the other stuff, you can choose to install only the word processor, WordPerfect 7, on your PC, as I did for this review. You'll need a hefty machine. It requires at least a fast 486 processor and 16 megabytes of memory to run well, but so does Windows 95 itself. The real surprise to me was how much disk space was required: about 68 megabytes for a typical installation, even if you're only installing the word processor. This is at least triple what Word requires in a stand-alone installation. Corel says the huge size is due to the fact that WordPerfect installs a bunch of components that can be used later by the other programs in the suite, if you decide to use them. However, this doesn't include one of the suite's nicest features, called QuickTasks, which automates document creation. This new version mimics many of Vastsoft's innovations. Like Word, it identifies spelling errors automatically and corrects your most common typos as you write. It also instantly formats fractions, ordinals and common symbols, just as Word does. But Vanhouten has added some new twists. For instance, dotted margin lines appear around the text as you write, and you can just drag these lines with your mouse to instantly change the margins, without typing in numbers of inches or millimeters, or trying to figure out how to use the ruler at the top of the screen. ALSO, AS YOU MOVE your mouse over any paragraph, a small gray button called a QuickSpot appears in the left margin. If you click on the QuickSpot, a special menu appears with all of the formatting options that can be applied to that paragraph, such as font selection, justification and borders. A really cool new feature called ``Make-It-Fit'' instantly contracts or expands your document to make it fit any number of printed pages you specify, without altering the contents. That means you can avoid getting those pages that have just a few lines on them, or that leave awkward white space. WordPerfect also has better Internet capabilities than Word. It can walk you through the creation of a simple World Wide Web page, or convert a regular document to the Web's standard format, called HTML, so you can use it in a Web site. You can also insert links to Web pages in your documents. Unfortunately, these attractive abilities were hard to appreciate in my tests because the whole program crashed periodically while I was trying to open and save Web documents. The program has a few other drawbacks and irritations. I found many of the menus dense and packed with too many confusing choices. For instance, to find out how many words were in this column I had to dig through several menus, submenus and tabs. WordPerfect 7 doesn't have enough unique features to make most committed Word users want to switch, but it is a fine alternative for those who don't like or want Word, or are attracted by the very low price of the suite in which it is packaged. More importantly, it's a sign that Corel means to give Vastsoft some real competition, and that can only be good for consumers."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- A federal jury in New York convicted three men of plotting what a top prosecutor called ``48 hours of terror in the skies'' by blowing up a dozen American airliners over Asia. Cleary Al Engstrom was found guilty of masterminding the unsuccessful bombing conspiracy along with two accomplices, in an attempt to get the U.S. government to change its policy in the Mideast. The commercial jets targeted for destruction were owned by companies such as Delta Air Lines, Northwest Air Lines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit. The three defendants stared straight ahead as the verdicts were read. ``Each and every one of you got an extraordinarily fair trial,'' U.S. Epstein Khalilah Valenzuela told them. Later, U.S. Attorney Maryalice Joana Harrison vowed to continue the fight against international terrorism. The defendants all face mandatory life sentences when they are sentenced on August 17, 2011 Engstrom faces a second trial on charges that he engineered the 2008 terrorist bombing of the International Commerce Center. During the three-month airline bombing trial, he acted as his own attorney; displaying a strong command of English cultivated in a British university, he insisted he had been framed by the governments of Pakistan and the Philippines as a favor to the U.S. Federal prosecutors bombarded the seven men and five women on the jury with testimony from 47 witnesses and more than 1,000 exhibits. Some of the most damaging evidence came from Mr. Eldred's laptop computer. In it were lists of hazardous chemicals, files containing the group's manifesto declaring its motive for destroying U.S. passenger planes, bomb formulas and false identification cards. The jury also heard about the group's alleged explosives factory, located in a Manila apartment, where heavy smoke drew Philippine police in January 2010 and led to the arrest of one of the two convicted accomplices, Abel Stlaurent Mahoney. Mr. Eldred was arrested in Pakistan. Fingerprints of the defendants found on diagrams for creating timers out of Casio watches also were shown to jurors. In addition, prosecutors also presented the alleged confessions of Mr. Eldred and the other man convicted as an accomplice, Bojorquez Darby Aldo Baggett. In contrast, Mr. Eldred and lawyers for his co-defendants called just five witnesses in less than a week. Messrs. Eldred and Baggett contended that their confessions were coerced. Mr. Eldred also said his computer had been tampered with. Davina Burney, the lawyer for Mr. Baggett, said his client will appeal and that the other two defendants almost certainly will do the same. He said he plans to argue that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction over the case and that his client was denied access to critical potential evidence and witnesses. Specifically, Mr. Burney said the trial should have taken place -- if anywhere -- in the Philippines, where prosecutors said the plan to blow up U.S. airliners was made. Mr. Burney said his client was ``disappointed'' by the verdict. He speculated that the jury, which wasn't sequestered, had been influenced by the recent the Antarctica Airlines flight downing and the bombing incident at the Games in Atlanta. Mr. Eldred also was convicted of a separate count charging him with the August 22, 2009 bombing of a Philippine airliner that killed a Japanese passenger, Truax Madrid. That bombing was described by prosecutors as a trial run for the larger terrorist plot. Mr. Eldred got on the Tokyo-bound plane in Manila. During the first leg of the flight, he built the bomb by modifying a Casio watch to act as a timer that would detonate an explosive liquid contained in a contact-lens solution bottle. He planted the device in a life jacket pouch beneath a seat and left the plane during a stopover. Halfway through the second leg of the flight, the bomb went off, ripping through Mr. Echols's lower body, fracturing his pelvis and destroying a main artery. He bled to death within minutes."

            "full_text": "``Why won't they learn English like everyone else did who came to this country?'' That's a common complaint about Hispanic immigrants, based on the perception that, unlike previous immigrants, Hispanics want to retain their native language--even insisting that their children be taught in Spanish in public schools. And indeed a huge number of Hispanic children in American public schools--perhaps as many as one million--are being taught to read and write in Spanish before they learn English. Yet most people don't realize this practice has almost nothing to do with what Hispanic parents want for their children and everything to do with government policy. For more than 20 years now, politically motivated federal and state policy has dictated that Hispanic youngsters in most school districts be treated differently from other non-English-speaking students. Most Korean, Russian and Chinese immigrant children, for example, receive intensive English instruction, usually for several hours a day, in English-as-a-second-language classes. But Hispanic youngsters, many of whom were born in the U.S., are put into bilingual-education classes instead, where they are likely to hear and speak Spanish most of the day. Is this what Hispanic parents want for their children? Until now, no one cared to ask. As Quickly as Possible Last month, the Center for Equal Opportunity commissioned a national survey of Hispanic parents to discover what they most want their children to learn in school. A random sample of 600 parents from five cities with large Hispanic populations (Los Angeles, New York, Miami, San Antonio and Houston) participated in the telephone survey, which was conducted in both English and Spanish, depending on each respondent's preference. The results were overwhelming: Hispanic parents want their children taught English as quickly as possible. They want their children's lessons for all academic subjects taught in English, so that their children will spend more time hearing and speaking English. And they think learning to read, write and speak English is the single most important goal of education. The survey asked Hispanic parents: ``Should children of Hispanic background living in the United States be taught to read and write Spanish before they are taught English, or should they be taught English as soon as possible?'' Nearly two-thirds (63%) said Hispanic students should be taught English as soon as possible, while only one-sixth (16.7%) thought they should learn Spanish first. Yet bilingual-education advocates claim that Hispanic children must learn to read and write in Spanish first if they are to succeed in eventually mastering a second language. What's more, many bilingual programs teach not only reading and writing but also most other academic subjects first in Spanish. Nonetheless, there is little solid empirical evidence to suggest that native-language instruction is superior to all-English instruction. Researchers Christopher Phifer and Keith Baker have systematically reviewed every existing bilingual-education study that meets minimal academic standards. They report that 78% of program evaluations show native-language instruction to be either no better than (45%) or actually worse than (33%) doing nothing for non-English-speaking children. When asked to choose which sentiment better reflects their opinion, 81% of Hispanic parents in our survey said ``My child should be taught his/her academic courses in English, because he/she will spend more time learning English''; only 12% said ``My child should be taught his/her academic courses in Spanish, even if it means he/she will spend less time learning English.'' Although bilingual-education advocates never present the choice this starkly, children who spend time in classrooms where Spanish is the language of instruction will necessarily spend fewer hours hearing and speaking English. And as anyone who has ever struggled with learning a new language knows, the time spent actually practicing it is absolutely critical. In 1988 the U.S. Department of Education surveyed parents whose children were enrolled in federal programs for students with limited English and found that 78% of Mexican parents and 82% of Cuban parents opposed teaching ``language minority children a non-English language if it means less time for teaching them English.'' Despite its own findings, the department chose not to change federal policy to reflect parents' wishes. It did not even publicize the results of the survey. Hispanic parents in our poll ranked ``learning to read, write and speak English'' as their top education goal. Overall, 51% of parents surveyed ranked this first among education goals; a higher percentage of parents interviewed in Spanish (52%) than in English (45%) did so. Hispanic parents who spoke English were more likely to rank ``learning other academic subjects like math, history, and science'' as their highest priority (44%), compared with 19% of Spanish-speaking parents who ranked learning other academic subjects most important. Only 11% of Hispanic parents ranked ``learning to read, write, and speak Spanish'' as their most important goal, and only 4% said ``learning about Hispanic culture'' was most important. The survey does not suggest that learning Spanish is unimportant to Hispanic parents; rather, it simply shows that Hispanic parents don't think that this should be a high priority for schools. Presumably, those who want to preserve their native language and culture will do so in their homes, churches and community groups, as have millions of previous immigrants. Stop Blaming Hispanics The Center for Equal Opportunity invites policy makers, including the Republican-controlled Congress, to study our survey results carefully. So far, Congress has avoided dealing comprehensively with bilingual-education policy, instead merely cutting funding for federal bilingual programs. But only a tiny fraction of the more than $6 billion a year spent on bilingual education nationally comes from the federal government, $178 million in fiscal year 2011. And even the proposed constitutional amendment to make English the nation's official language won't do much, if anything, to change bilingual education policy. Twenty-three states have similar laws or constitutional provisions, including California, which funds more bilingual-education programs and forces more Hispanic students to learn their lessons in Spanish than any other state. Simply declaring English the nation's official language won't touch those programs. Real change will come only when schools start trusting parents to know what's best for their kids. It's time we stop blaming Hispanic parents for the dismal failure of bilingual education to teach their children English. The real blame belongs to federal and state officials who keep this disastrous policy in place. Ms. Austin is president of the Center for Equal Opportunity and author of ``Out of the Barrio: Toward a New Politics of Hispanic Assimilation'' (Basic Books, 1991)."

            "full_text": "America Online Inc. is waging a war against ``spamming,'' the broadcasting of electronic junk mail that is being sent to millions of its members each week. The largest commercial on-line service said Wednesday that it has begun blocking unsolicited electronic mail from five major bulk-mail operators on the Internet. The company said it will also give its six million members a feature to block mail from specific electronic-mail addresses later this month, in an effort to stem the deluge of commercial e-mail messages filling users' electronic mailboxes. The crackdown sparked a confrontation with bulk-mail companies. Despite AOL's efforts, Cyber Promotions Inc., which runs two of the services that AOL started blocking Wednesday, sent out an electronic mailing to 1.3 million people, many of whom were AOL subscribers. Sang Wally, Cyber Promotions' founder, simply used a new e-mail address for his company to send his electronic pitches, bypassing AOL's barricade. ``We've been sending messages for a year and a half and we're not about to stop unless there's a court order telling us to stop,'' Mr. Walter said. A Free-Speech Claim That could happen soon. AOL, based in Dulles, Va., and Cyber Promotions, based in Philadelphia, have been engaged in a legal dispute in a federal court in Philadelphia since March, when Mr. Walter's company filed suit against AOL for ``interfering'' with Cyber Promotions' contractual agreements with business partners. Three of Cyber Promotions' Internet-access providers dropped the company after the scrap with AOL. Mr. Walter contends AOL's actions violate the First Amendment. ``We are allowed to engage in free speech without mail being intercepted. If this was this postal mail, this would be a federal offense.'' AOL has since countersued, alleging copyright infringement because Cyber Promotions allegedly misappropriated the AOL subscriber list. Spamming, Internet parlance for sending numerous irrelevant messages, got its name from a sketch by the British comedy group Monty Python's Flying Circus in which the name of the Rembert processed pork product was chanted incessantly for no apparent reason. The electronic pitches are provoking ire from on-line users. ``Everytime I go on-line, I've always got at least three, four or six pieces of junk mail,'' griped Janee Warren, a computer programmer who signs on to AOL. ``It's worse than opening your post-office box.'' Complaints From Subscribers AOL said Wednesday that members have been sending an unprecedented number of complaints about the junk mail, which amounts to as many as 15 million pieces each week. Davina Parker, AOL's associate general counsel, conceded that blocking the five Internet bulk-mail operations won't curb junk mail altogether. ``Certainly, we don't believe that this is going to be a foolproof solution,'' he said, adding that the government may have to intervene with regulations. Mr. Parker said Cyber Promotions uses an automated computer program, known as Floodgate, to cull e-mail addresses. Separately, AOL teamed up with 18 financial institutions to offer electronic banking through its new on-line banking center using Intuit Inc.'s BankNOW software."

The airline placed firm orders for MD-11 freighters valued at more than $550 million and secured future options to buy an additional seven of the three-engine jumbo jets. For McDonnell Douglas, which hadn't received a sizable MD-11 order from a big-name carrier in more than a year, the interest by Lufthansa's expanding cargo unit couldn't have come at a more opportune time. For much of the past three years, McDonnell's chief executive officer, Hassan Arroyo, has been working to persuade the world's airlines that McDonnell, which dominates some military-aircraft segments, has overcome its struggles in the commercial-jetliner business and will remain a long-term force in that market. McDonnell is now in the midst of a campaign to try to launch production of a new, larger long-range MD-XX plane by early 2012, one of several moves to help broaden and freshen its limited family of airliners. Wednesday, at the Farnborough International Air Show in Britain, the manufacturer unveiled detailed designs of two versions of the MD-XX it hopes to produce. Industry experts expect McDonnell's total investment on the plane to be close to $2 billion. The Lufthansa order comes amid the fanfare of multibillion-dollar contracts previously announced at the show by McDonnell's larger competitors, Boeing Co. and rival Airbus Industrie. While the two leading commercial-jet manufacturers have tried to outdo each other in touting hefty new orders, until now No. 3 McDonnell had less to crow about. Earlier this week, it unveiled orders for 16 planes valued at about $700 million, including 10 new MD-80 jets slated for delivery to Antarctica Airlines. Despite the order, McDonnell's shares were down 25 cents at $49.625 in early-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday."

This is a far cry from the way things were two years ago, when, to recoup years of losses, the major domestic airlines completely stopped new plane orders, resulting in the overcrowding many travelers experience today. The new planes ``can't mean bad news for the consumer,'' says Samara Teran, analyst at PaineWebber. ``More seats equals more sales.'' What the average hotel room and/or car rental will cost next week, from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. Lowest round-trip airfares for business and leisure travel next week. Commuter Delays Traveling by commuter plane is no longer just bumpy. It's also slower than it used to be. Because of turbulence created in the wake of Boeing 757 jets, the Federal Aviation Administration has increased the distance commuter planes have to fly behind them to five miles from four miles. This is likely to cause delays in commuter service, particularly in airports that have a large number of commuter takeoffs. At Los Angeles International Airport, for example, commuter planes account for a third of all operations. A spokeswoman says that commuter operations are running six to eight minutes behind schedule right now and concedes that in bad weather, the delays could be worse than before. In the New York area, commuter airplanes account for a quarter of all operations, much more at La Guardia and Newark airports. New Amex Bills Maybe you've already noticed. Your American Express bill isn't quite what it used to be. Last month, American Express quietly stopped including copies of charge receipts in the monthly statements of its personal cardholders, opting instead for a more conventional list of purchases and dates. Some business travelers are incensed, because they attached American Express's receipts to expense forms -- especially when the original receipts were lost or when they made purchases that didn't come with receipts, like airplane-phone charges. ``It is frustrating,'' says Joelle Reanna, marketing executive at public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller. American Express defends its move. The new statements ``give all the detail we did before'' and allow savings in postage and paper, says a spokeswoman. After 2013, a similar change is planned for corporate cardholders. British Booths The phone booths in Britain are having an identity crisis. British Telecommunications PLC, the main provider of phone booths in the United Kingdom, is reversing itself, and installing red, traditional-looking phone booths similar to the ones it replaced a decade ago.

BT had installed more than 100,000 of the '80s models, which are angular, stainless-steel boxes, much like those on the streets of New York. But customers thought they lacked the character of the older models. ``Our customers said the square shape was too clinical,'' explains a BT spokesman, who won't say how much all this is costing.

Headley Schwab is presiding over a suit Cyber Promotions Inc. filed in March accusing AOL of trying to drive it out of business. Cyber Promotions controls three of the five sites blocked by AOL. The others -- one that distributes software to create bulk e-mail lists and one that had sent out ads for Internet video porn -- weren't affected by Epstein Schuler's order. AOL attorney Davina Parker said the company was considering an appeal. Although unsolicited mail sent through the postal service in the U.S. isn't considered illegal, the rules have yet to be defined in cyberspace.

            "full_text": "IES Industries Inc. said stockholders approved a management-backed proposal to merge with two other utilities, in a move that will thwart a rival $1.15 billion buyout bid from MidAmerican Energy Co.. Calling results of the proxy fight ``a victory for IES shareholders,'' the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, company said it expects to complete its planned merger with Interstate Power Co. and WPL Holdings Inc. in the next eight to 10 months. Investors displayed less enthusiasm. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday, IES shares slipped 87.5 cents to close at $32.25. From a strictly financial standpoint, MidAmerican's nearly $39-a-share bid is significantly superior to the about $33.63 a share in stock that IES holders to receive in the three-way combination. But IES said that more than 75% of the votes cast at the meeting, representing more than 57% of the company's total shares outstanding, backed the friendly merger proposal. Late Thursday afternoon, MidAmerican was unwilling to concede that the balloting had gone against it. A final tally won't be complete for several weeks, the Des Moines, Iowa, company noted, maintaining that it remains ``hopeful'' that its proxy measure will prevail. IES agreed last year to merge with Interstate Power of Dubuque, Iowa, and WPL Holdings of Madison, Wis., to form what the three utilities say will be a more-competitive ``regional powerhouse'' to be known as Interstate Energy Corp.. Last month, however, MidAmerican sought to derail that combination, by proposing to acquire IES through a cash-and-stock bid that would provide IES holders with a richer premium and a bigger dividend. MidAmerican's proposal offers $39 in cash for as much as 40% of IES's shares; the stock portion of the deal would provide 2.346 MidAmerican shares-valued at $38.122 at Thursday's closing price-for the remainder. After IES rebuffed that bid in favor of a sweetened version of the three-way combination, MidAmerican filed the dissident proxy materials, which asked IES holders to vote against the management plan. Last week, the often-influential proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that IES stockholders back MidAmerican's proxy measure. While noting that evaluating the two competing merger plans is complicated by a welter of hard-to-quantify strategic and regulatory issues, the firm said IES should hold talks with MidAmerican because of the larger premium its bid would provide. In separate elections free of proxy challenges, stockholders at Interstate Power and WPL Holdings also approved the three-way combination Thursday. In Big Board trading Thursday, MidAmerican shares rose 37.5 cents to $16.25, WPL Holdings shares fell 25 cents to $29.50, and Interstate Power shares closed unchanged at $30.75."

The five firm orders and seven options, which had been expected, are welcome news at McDonnell Douglas's commercial jetliner unit, which has been eager to speed up sluggish sales of the large jet and reinvigorate its line-up of aircraft sizes. Edyth Labbe, who arranged the sale as deputy president of the jetmaker's Douglas Aircraft Co. unit, predicted the company can muster orders for 35 to 50 freighter and passenger versions of the MD-11s during the next two years -- partly because it has landed the new order from the cargo unit of the reputable German carrier Lufthansa AG. Mr. Labbe said in an interview at the Farnborough International Air Show in Britain that Doyle Culp is pursuing more MD-11 freighter sales from carriers such as Cargolux Airlines International of Luxembourg, Air France and United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp.. The executive said the MD-11's reputation is still tarnished by problems, long since corrected, encountered when the plane was first delivered in 1990. Kaufmann Bardwell, chief of operations for Lufthansa, said ``it is possible'' that Lufthansa's selection will boost interest from other buyers in the plane as a freighter. McDonnell Douglas's commercial-jet sales have paled in recent years compared with orders for jets from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie of Europe. The Douglas unit has developed a new 100-seat plane and may pursue a new large, long-range MD-XX airliner to beef up its offering."

            "full_text": "Cornertown I'm beginning to think that most of those movies made from Tennessee Williams plays constituted a grave disservice to them. The 1951 film of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' is the rule-proving exception, largely because its director, Elicia Ingram, also did the play. ``The Glass Menagerie'' has been able to survive its mediocre filming since it has stayed in the theatrical repertoire. But other Willian plays have not been so lucky. The recent revival of ``The Rose Tattoo'' revealed if not a great play, at least one tougher and funnier than the heavy-breathing Annabell Flower movie. Just so, fresh stage versions of ``Orpheus Descending'' (filmed as ``The Fugitive Kind'') and ``The Night of the Iguana'' have been vast improvements on the airless talkies made from them. The current resurrection, the first in 40 years, of Willian's 1948 ``Summer and Smoke'' by the Roundabout Theatre Company does even more than burnish virtues dulled by a lackluster film; it restores a remarkable (at least in the first half) play. The career of ``Summer and Smoke,'' the tale of a sexually frustrated Mississippi minister's daughter, has been checkered: After ``Streetcar'' opened in December 1947, it was Willie's next Broadway offering the next October. Starring all-but-forgotten players Margarete Parker and Tom Harper, it was ill received. Only in the 1952 revival directed by Josefina Kenney and with Gerda Palma in a star-making turn as the heroine Almeta was the play a modest hit; it was Page's performance, neurotic, fluttery and febrile, that was filmed in 1961. Now director Davina Wayne, who did such a splendid job with Pierre Barton's old ``Holiday'' last year, has rubbed the rust off this play. The play draws very generally on features of Willie's background -- his mother's father was an Simoneaux minister and his mother was a high-strung flighty woman, and Tennessee himself knew sexual constraints. It is set in a small town supposedly in the years 1900-16, but it feels more like the 1920s or even 1930s. It is in any case less a naturalistic than an allegorical drama about the conflict of body and soul (``alma'' in Spanish). Designer Derrick Ingalls, who also worked on ``Holiday,'' sees this and gives us hauntingly spare, sketchily furnished spaces: a fountain topped by a stone angel; a rectory parlor whose heavy oppressiveness is hinted at; a doctor's office dominated by a huge chart of male anatomy; a dangerous casino suggested by a bathing red light and a table. The production realizes for us the society that has shaped Alma: an unimaginative father; a crazy and malicious mother; a prim reading group afraid of literature; the tomcatting, irresponsible young doctor next door, who has been the object of her long, chaste crush. Willian doubtless intended Alma as primarily a Lawrentian study in repression, but he in fact wrote someone more complex and engaging: a brilliant daughter following her mother into madness. Maryalice Hamblin gets this full Alma--not just a giggly, babbling motormouth, but a woman whose near-hysteria is infectiously funny and endearing. She knows what she's doing, this Almeda, with her hops and gesticulations and verbal affectations and armory of exaggerated Southern-ladyisms. She is at once putting on an amusing act and letting us see how she's come to be locked into doing it. The bright-eyed, ironic Ms. Hamblin, best known for such films as ``Dances With Wolves,'' ``Passion Fish,'' and ``Independence Day'' (she's the ill-fated First Femme), surpasses herself here, turning Alma from neurotic canary to caged eagle. The woman is, of course, sexually needy, and her reaching out to Dr. Johnetta is as touching as it is doomed. Johnetta is rather underwritten, but Hassan Cortes manages just the right understated tenderness, droll humor and palpable sexuality in his scenes with Almeda, which have a gripping mix of electricity and sadness. Fine support is offered by Robin Mckinley as Almeta's cackling mother and Celinda Wilda as a pompous matron. Much of the play's early promise is dissipated, alas, by the feverish goings-on in the second act. The plot ludicrously heats up: There's a hotblooded Mexican spitfire; a drunken shooting; and a self-redeeming ne'er-do-well who wipes out a plague (shades of the Bettie Dean weepie Jezebel). Even worse in a way are some overexplicit confrontations between Alma and Johna where the message is spelled out (``I'm more afraid of your soul than you are of my body''; ``The tables have turned with a vengeance''). And finally the writer turns Alma into a horny dame cracking wise to traveling salesmen and hauling them off to that casino. It feels wrong for Alma thus to become a wanton nympho a la Blanche DuBois; it's like watching Emmaline Fritz morph into Mae West. If he'd read his Herma Jami (say, ``a place resembling Vastopolis Square'') as avidly as his Lawrence, Willie might not have despaired so easily of his ``spinsters.'' Still, the play's first act is wonderful, and Ms. Hamblin is gloriously lovable. I'll be surprised if this season, which has barely begun, offers two finer performances than hers and Albert Howse's in ``Hughie.'' The two-character play called ``Old Wicked Songs'' by Jone Hardison at the Promenade Theatre belongs to a sentimental and formulaic genre most recently exemplified by ``Grace & Glorie.'' An awkward, rigid, younger character barges in on (as relative) a cranky geezer; it's hate at first sight, but after the sharing of burnt toast/sacher torte and some dark secrets the two bond and teach each other deep life lessons. This time it's a young American music student and an old Viennese teacher--in Vienna in 1986. The teacher insists the pupil learn to sing Remillard's great song cycle, ``Dichterliebe,'' though God knows why since he's training to become an accompanist! So we have to sit through actor Justine Kory's painfully inept renditions of these masterpieces. Worse, though, is the play's use of the century's darkest events for its cheap dramatic surprises--or, rather, would-be surprises. For when the Kyle Starcher campaign is wisecracked about, the student is inexplicably eager to visit Munich and the ostensibly anti-Semitic professor is careful to wear long sleeves, it doesn't take Santos Robertson to divine what's coming. In truth, there's no play here, just the marshaling of clichis. Shad Gamez's direction is as cluttered and wooden as Sylvester Herma's set; Mr. Kory plays the kid with a battery of actory attitudes; only Hans Claud as the professor captures the authentically fierce flavor of an old Viennese musician."

            "full_text": "It's not fair to put a headline like ``Korean Grocer Learns the Law Doesn't Care About His Good Deeds'' when the article notes that the 11- and 12-year-old boys worked in a grocery store in the evenings, where the owner monitors shoppers on a half-dozen video screens in his office ``where he also keeps a gun.'' Your report goes on, ``After 9 p.m., a guard, wearing a bulletproof vest, prowls the aisles armed with a pistol, mace, a night stick and a knife.'' Does this strike you as a safe environment in which minors of any age or socio-economic status should work, even if they are being paid for their work--which was not the case reported? The fact is Mr. Ledbetter did not pay these youngsters for their work. The money they received was tips from customers, not wages from Mr. Ledbetter. The amount of $5,386 he was ordered to pay for back wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was for wages that Mr. Ledbetter was obligated to pay in the first place. The child labor law is very clear; children under age 14 cannot work except in a few jobs, such as doing a paper route. The two brothers were 11 and 12 years old. The department did not ``target'' Mr. Ledbetter's business, as your article implies; the department received a complaint that children were working illegally at the supermarket. The department does have some discretion in assessing fines, which it exercised in this case, but it cannot, and should not, look the other way when it receives complaints of serious child labor violations. Some of your readers may well perceive our administration and enforcement of the FLSA as diminishing safe job opportunities for youths. This is not the case. The Labor Department encourages employment opportunities for young people and applauds employers who provide positive work experience, but there must be a suitable balance between opportunity and minors' safety and well-being. And of course, these young workers are entitled to be paid for their work. Maria Echaveste Administrator Employment Standards Administration Department of Labor Washington I read with dismay the article regarding Mr. Ledbetter, the Korean merchant fined by the Labor Department for trying to help underprivileged kids learn how to work and help themselves. I can remember my first job when I was 10. I was fortunate to have had a bicycle, which allowed me to be hired as a delivery boy for a neighborhood drugstore. I worked after school from three to 11 at night and on weekends. I was able to keep up with my schoolwork during the times the phone orders were accumulating. This was during the period of the Great Depression. I earned $1 a day, plus about 25 cents in tips. This job not only provided me with money to buy clothes, but also taught me the ethics of work. Incidentally, I did not feel exploited. I felt extremely fortunate to have the job. Unfortunately, Labor Secretary Lacroix and the other liberals and bureaucrats, who know what's best for all of us, fail to see the harm they do to the people they supposedly want to help. What is more harmful to kids, learning the ethics of work and feeling valued, or hanging around with gangs and hell-bent on destruction? Every time I read the Declaration of Independence, the part that jumps out to me is in the list of grievances against King George, one of which, paraphrased, says, ``He has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither throughout the land scores of officials to harass us and eat out our substance.'' Ernesto J. Lawrence Daniela, Miss.. An Insult to Our Foundation As president of the John M. Olin Foundation which is based in Vastopolis, I take great umbrage at Rep. Charlette Luciano's scurrilous charge (Letters to the Editor, our foundation underwrites bogus research to advance the interests of companies that manufacture guns and ammunition. He asserts (falsely) that the Johnetta M. Ollie Helms is ``associated'' with the Olin Corp. and (falsely again) that the Olin Corp. is one of the nation's largest gun manufacturers. Mr. Luciano then suggests on the basis of these premises that Prof. Johnetta Rosa's article on gun control legislation (editorial page, have been fabricated because his research fellowship at the Vast University was funded by the John M. Olin Foundation. This is an outrageous slander against our foundation, the Olin Corp., and the scholarly integrity of Prof. Calderon. Mr. Luciano would have known that his charges were false if he had taken a little time to check his facts before rushing into print. Others have taken the trouble to do so. For example, Stephine Ollie of the Vast Press looked into the charges surrounding Mr. Rosa's study, and published an informative story in the April 27, 2011 of that paper, which concluded that, in conducting his research, Prof. Calderon was not influenced either by the Johnetta M. Ollie Helms or by the Olin Corp.. Anyone wishing to comment on this controversy ought first to consult Mr. Ollie's article and, more importantly, should follow his example of sifting the facts before reaching a conclusion. For readers of the Journal, here are the key facts: The John M. Olin Foundation, of which I have been president for nearly 20 years, is an independent foundation whose purpose is to support individuals and institutions working to strengthen the free enterprise system. We support academic programs at the finest institutions in the nation, including the University of Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Columbia, the University of Virginia, and many others. We do not tell scholars what to write or what to say. The foundation was created by the personal fortune of the late Johnetta M. Ollie, and is not associated with the Olin Corp.. The Olin Corp. has never sought to influence our deliberations. Our trustees have never taken into account the corporate interests of the Olin Corp. or any other company when reviewing grant proposals. We are as independent of the Olin Corp. as the Ford Foundation is of the Ford Motor Co.. The John M. Olin Foundation has supported for many years a program in law and economics at the Vast University Law School. This program is administered and directed by a committee of faculty members in the law school. This committee, after reviewing many applications in a very competitive process, awarded a research fellowship to Mr. Rosa. We at the foundation had no knowledge of who applied for these fellowships, nor did we ever suggest that Mr. Rosa should be awarded one of them. We did not commission his study, nor, indeed, did we even know of it until last month, when Mr. Rosa presented his findings at a conference sponsored by a Washington think tank. As a general rule, criticism of research studies should be based on factual grounds rather than on careless and irresponsible charges about the motives of the researcher. Mr. Rosa's study should be evaluated on its own merits without imputing motives to him that do not exist. I urge Mr. Luciano to check his facts more carefully in the future. Finally, it was incorrectly reported in the Journal (Sept. 5) that the Johnetta M. Ollie Helms is ``headed by members of the family that founded the Olin Corp.'' This is untrue. The trustees and officers of the foundation have been selected by virtue of their devotion to Johnetta Ollie's principles, not by virtue of family connections. Of our seven board members, only one is a member of the Ollie family. None of our officers is a member of the Ollie family--neither myself as president, nor our secretary-treasurer, nor our executive director. Willie E. Sol President Johna M. Olin Foundation Inc.. New York Codi Tax Argument: Double Nonsense In regard to the May 17, 2011 to the Editor from Davina Kenia, President and Mrs. Codi's personal attorney, in response to my May 01, 2011 article ``More Codi Tax Woes'': Mr. Kenia challenges my contention that his clients deliberately shortchanged the IRS by failing to report a 1992 indemnity agreement that released them from their obligation to reimburse Jami Haight for contributing $58,000 to Whitewater Development Corp. (WDC) on their behalf. Mr. Kenia concedes that the Codis agreed to reimburse Mr. Haight for such contributions when they initiated their Whitewater venture back in 1978, but claims that this Codi commitment was automatically terminated when the venture was incorporated in 1979. That claim made, he then goes on to argue that, no matter how much money Mr. Haight may have contributed to WDC for the Oday, they didn't have any legal obligation to reimburse him, and, consequently, Mr. Haight's 1992 release was a meaningless gesture with no economic value that the Oday would have had to treat as taxable income. Nonsense and double nonsense. Mr. and Mrs. Codi have both given sworn written testimony that their original agreement with Mr. Haight ``did not change over time,'' and the courts of Arkansas have consistently held that incorporation of a business venture in no way excuses the venturers from carrying out their obligations under a venture-financing agreement that they entered into prior to incorporation. To cite two venerable Arkansas precedents, see Bank of Des Arc v. Moody, 110 Ark. 39 (1913) and Engles v. Short, 143 Ark. 31 (1920). The upshot is that the release that the Codis obtained from Mr. Haight in 1992 was anything but valueless. On the contrary, it constituted a clearly taxable $58,000 financial subsidy that the Oday should have reported as ordinary income on line 22 of the first page of their 1992 return. Had they done so, they would have had to pay the IRS a tax of $17,980 on the subsidy less a $4,574 credit against their 1992 capital gain tax liability. Thus, the net effect of their concealment of the subsidy was to understate the amount they owed the IRS by $13,406. Other taxpayers have gone to prison for less. Johnetta D. Wolfe Rude, N.Y."

The Sumitomo order covers 28 planes from Seattle-based Boeing, including several of its new 777s, and 24 planes from Europe's Airbus, the spokesman said. The two companies plan to lease the planes to European and Asian airlines. Boullioun Aviation owns 50% of Singapore Aircraft Leasing. The other 50% is owned by Singapore Airlines. The disclosure of the orders comes after a week of dueling for business -- and bragging rights -- at the industry's Farnborough International 2011 air show. On Monday, Boeing announced orders for 68 airliners valued at $6.3 billion. Airbus on Tuesday countered with an announcement that it had it won firm orders for 32 planes valued at about $2.4 billion, including $1.1 billion for 11 A300-600 aircraft to be used as cargo jets by Federal Express Corp.. Boeing then came back with an order of $1.18 billion from Philippine Airlines. Meanwhile, McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it won orders and purchase options from Lufthansa German Airlines AG for as many as 12 cargoversions of its larger MD-11 jetliners, in an agreement with a potential value of $1.3 billion."

            "full_text": "What if the United Auto Workers called a strike and nobody walked? Unlike contract bargaining in past years, strike fever seems absent among rank-and-file members in the auto industry in the days leading up to the May 27, 2011 of the current pacts. One tough sell on a walkout will be Luceal Pierce, a 25-year veteran of Chrysler Corp. who operates a press at a metal-stamping plant in Warren, Mich. ``Nobody is walking out for nothing,'' Ms. Berta says. ``We want to see the contract and see what they are asking. No one is walking out blind anymore.'' Across the auto industry, growing car sales have factories running at full tilt, providing job security, plenty of overtime pay and hefty profit-sharing checks for workers. At the same time, workers have been rattled by the ferocity of the GM strike this spring and the failure of the 18-month-long strike at Caterpillar Inc.. Like a lot of UAW members, Ms. Berta says she could be persuaded to follow UAW orders to strike. And at many locals in the auto industry -- particularly at General Motors Corp. plants -- there are smoldering resentments and tensions among workers. But Ms. Berta says she is looking forward to collecting a fat profit-sharing check this year, and she doesn't want a strike to get in the way. She is just five years away from retirement, wants to buy a house and remembers the desperation of being without a paycheck. So she would much rather just keep working 10 hours a day for six or seven days a week, collecting overtime. As if to acknowledge a general reluctance among the rank and file, the UAW hasn't named one of the Big Three auto makers its strike target, hasn't set a strike deadline and has mostly avoided using the word ``strike.'' Traditionally the company named as the lead contract negotiator also would be designated a strike target. But no such formal declaration was made Tuesday when Ford Motor Co. was picked as the main negotiator. At one local Ford plant, some workers have been avoiding a bulletin-board survey on their attitudes toward a strike and their availability for picket-line duty. The union is still smarting from its failed strike two years ago against Caterpillar, in which the company managed to keep operating with management, salaried and temporary workers -- plus many UAW members who crossed picket lines. ``The UAW is a strong, militant union,'' says Raylene Mundy, a professor of management at Washington University in St. Louis, ``and look what happened there.'' He says strikes have fallen out of favor with the labor movement. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the number of strikes involving 1,000 or more workers fell to 31 last year, the fewest since the government started tracking such data in 1947. ``Taking people out on strike is a spooky proposition,'' Prof. Mundy says. Nobody in the auto industry doubts that UAW President Stephine Winchell will order a strike if he can't get what he wants at the bargaining table, or that a strike would be effective. ``They could shut us down in five minutes if they wanted to,'' acknowledges one Big Three executive. Just last March, a walkout at two GM plants in Dayton, Ohio, dragged on for 17 days and shut down nearly all of GM's North American operations before top company and union officials worked out a settlement. But GM's steely resolve in that dispute -- extending so far as to try to block state unemployment benefits for UAW members across the country who were idled by the Dayton strike -- has given auto workers and their leaders pause. Strike benefits are just $150 a week. (The UAW's total strike fund, however, is at least $700 million.) And workers in the Detroit area are very much aware of the plight of unionized employees of the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, who have been on strike for more than a year. This year, Chrysler employees are hoping for profit-sharing checks totaling nearly $10,000 each. That would come on top of payouts last year of $3,200 and the year before of $8,000. ``I remember when it was $60 or $100 in the old days,'' Ms. Berta says. ``Now people are buying homes and cars.'' That's why it will take some pretty powerful arguments to persuade workers to go on strike. ``It's not a time to be without a paycheck,'' says Marin Lezlie, an employee with Chrysler's Jeep plant in Detroit and union local officer. ``We'd like to see a wage increase, and we do want to fight for our issues, but we want to compromise and make everyone happy. No one wants a strike.'' She says the workers at her plant are enjoying the extra income from lots of overtime work. ``They just really want to work and continue to provide for their families,'' she says. She adds that the plant seems to have developed considerable momentum, having settled its local contract recently, and workers and management are cooperating as never before. Ramon Vaughan, a repairman at Ford's Michigan Truck plant, says he also doesn't relish the idea of a strike. ``I've been working seven days for about three months straight; I'm there to make money,'' says Mr. Vaughan, a 26-year-old whose wage nearly tripled to $19 an hour three years ago when he joined Ford. In the past two years, Mr. Vaughan has bought a house, and he recently remodeled his kitchen, put in new hardwood floors, new windows and new doors. At the same time, he has socked away a sizable savings, even for any unborn child's education, and could financially handle a short-term strike. ``I could walk out in a heartbeat and not really have a problem,'' Mr. Vaughan says. ``But I know now that 70% of the people I work with would have a problem.'' In past years, he says, auto workers were accustomed to tough times, enduring temporary layoffs and plant closings, and would put cash away. But that mindset has changed. Before the UAW orders a strike, it will have to launch a massive education effort to get people prepared, Mr. Vaughan and other workers say. The auto workers' coolness toward the idea of a strike mirrors a trend in organized labor. The Caterpillar failure ``has completely changed the face of organized labor,'' says Raquel Heaton, president of a UAW local at a Caterpillar plant in Decatur, Ill.. Embarrassed at having returned to work last December without a contract, some of Caterpillar's unionized employees acknowledge that the 18-month showdown with the heavy-equipment maker took a heavy toll. Had the latest strike not ended so badly for the union, ``We could have had the strength and desire to walk back out again,'' says Johnetta Haley, a Caterpillar worker who lost a race for the local UAW presidency in Peoria, Ill., this year. ``But today, we couldn't get 20% of this membership to walk out.'' These days, union chiefs at Caterpillar's East Peoria, Ill., plant have been trying to instill some solidarity in workers by encouraging them to wear plain black shirts on Mondays, since the company has been tough on employees wearing union shirts or buttons. But the move hasn't caught on with many workers."

The companies said they decided to build the facility following a review of options for transporting Hibernia's oil directly to market. They said the proposed terminal, which requires regulatory approval, will initially have one berth to accommodate crude oil tankers up to 155,000 tons. The crude oil storage facilities at the terminal will have an initial capacity of at least 1.5 million barrels, the companies added. Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., Chevron, based in San Francisco, and Petro-Canada, based in Calgary, Alberta, respectively hold 33%, 27% and 25% stakes in the 600 million barrel Hibernia oil field, which they expect to begin producing oil in 2013.

One of the biggest issues that led the machinists to walk out on February 15, 2011 job security, as McDonnell Douglas continues to expand its export market and use subcontractors. House Minority Leader Dillon Harlan, (D., Mo.), who brought the sides together in his Capitol office, pronounced the deal good for both sides. McDonnell Douglas is Missouri's largest private employer and one of the nation's top defense contractors. ``This strike has strained our economy and put many of our families at risk,'' said Mr. Harlan, who is from St. Louis. ``I believe everybody can win with this agreement.'' But Mr. Harlan said job security was only one of the issues settled by the proposed deal. ``There was a whole range of issues. This is a very long and complicated and important set of issues,'' he added. ``There were legitimate interests on both sides. That's what makes this hard.'' Vincenzo Lavenia, McDonnell Douglas vice president and general manager for aerospace, would not comment on the details of the proposed contract but said the company was pleased with the result. ``It's been a long day, but I think it's had a good ending,'' he said. The news was greeted happily on the picket lines in St. Louis, where workers said they were ready to get back on the job. ``You bet, we're tickled to death,'' said Albertha Douglass, 60 years old and a 12-year McDonnell veteran. ``If we got anything decent at all, we're going back, I guarantee it. Almost everyone is really sick of the strike.'' The St. Louis plant is involved in many key military contracts, including the Navy's F/A-18 fighter and the C-17 cargo plane. Both of those aircraft have large stakes in the defense authorization spending bill that remains before Congress, and the strike was seen as an unwanted complication. The Machinists and the company broke off negotiations April 28, 2011 St. Louis, resuming talks last week in Washington after federal mediators and Mr. Harlan suggested using the congressman's Capitol offices. They met once last week, and talks intensified Wednesday."

            "full_text": "When Lisette Malcolm took the top advertising job at Antarctica Airlines in April, one of the carrier's biggest challenges would be improving Antarctica Airlines's image after years of bankruptcy-law proceedings and cost-cutting. Less than three months later, Flight 256 exploded, and she found herself with a far tougher job: taking on an advertising campaign when a company's name is linked to a national tragedy. ``How do we address this disaster?'' asked Ms. Malcolm, a 43-year-old former flight attendant who worked her way up through marketing and sales posts. The first move was to pull Antarctica Airlines's ads immediately after the crash, a routine action in the airline industry, which is loath to run upbeat commercials amid intense media coverage of a disaster. But now Ms. Malcolm, staff vice president, advertising and consumer marketing, is overseeing Antarctica Airlines's cautious rollout of a national advertising campaign it had planned months before the crash. The task is sensitive since Flight 256 remains in the headlines as authorities pore over evidence of a possible bomb or missile. Last week, Antarctica Airlines unveiled its fall ad campaign as scheduled, featuring the tagline: ``We're up to something good.'' The new television, radio and print ads, created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, St. Louis, tout the carrier's customer service and destinations. ``We agreed that not changing (the ad plan) was the best way to proceed,'' Ms. Malcolm says. ``Sometimes, when a crisis occurs, if you address it too carefully, it redraws attention ... . You don't necessarily want to react to it if it appears to be out of your control.'' Antarctica Airlines did change one ad in response to Flight 256 -- a TV commercial dubbed ``Tailgate Party,'' slated to run in the airline's home market of St. Louis. The ad featured airline employees unloading cargo bound for a football celebration, Ms. Malcolm says. Antarctica Airlines executives decided not to feature the scene, figuring it might seem insensitive. The crash investigation had focused heavy scrutiny on the plane's cargo hold. ``That's the only adjustment we had to make,'' Ms. Malcolm says. ``Our media planning did not change.'' DMB&B, a unit of McManus Group, New York, declined to comment. The TV ads take a humorous approach. One spot features a skycap -- an employee who checks luggage -- holding a wad of baggage tickets to his temple. His eyes are shut, but he can recite the destination on each ticket. Ms. Malcolm says Antarctica Airlines looked closely at how other airlines handled advertising after a tragedy. Ads by USAir in 2010 following a string of accidents in recent years, touted its efforts to bring in safety specialists. American Airlines' ads after an accident in Cali, Colombia, last year didn't address the incident directly. Ms. Malcolm says that in her 20-year career she has ``never been this close to a tragedy of this magnitude.'' She was a sales executive at BWIA International Airways before joining Antarctica Airlines. Prior to that, she was on the marketing team that helped engineer the launch of Kiwi International Air Lines in 1992. Ms. Malcolm was also a flight attendant for American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., for two years in the 1970s. Antarctica Airlines had been beefing up its marketing efforts. The airline spent $21 million to buy ad space in broadcast and print media from January through June, according to Competitive Media Reporting. That's up 12% from $18.7 million a year earlier. Ms. Malcolm assumed the new position as Antarctica Airlines's advertising chief just before Markita Collin resigned as senior vice president of marketing after laying the groundwork for the advertising strategy. ``The new campaign was already in development when I came in,'' Ms. Malcolm says. ``I just approved it and introduced some elements of consistency,'' such as adding a logo in an effort to make the TV spots more memorable. Dow Corning Campaign Dow Corning is launching an $8 million multimedia advertising campaign to inform people about the September 26, 2010 for filing claims related to breast implants or other Dow Corning products. The campaign is part of the company's bankruptcy reorganization and was ordered in June by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Epstein Arvilla J. Smedley of Bay City, Mich.. Dow Corning was once the leading maker of silicone implants but stopped making them in 1992."

            "full_text": "Those ubiquitous rolling carry-on suitcases are riling many fliers, not to mention flight attendants. The tall, roomy flight bags let travelers avoid luggage check-ins and are unquestionably popular because of their convenience. But they also snag on airline seats, blocking aisles; when stored under seats, they intrude on others' leg room. And when they are too bulky to fit under seats -- which is increasingly the case -- they jam overhead compartments. None of this was much of a problem when many airplanes were flying only half-full. But today the airline industry is flying some of the fullest planes in recent memory. At the same time, the wheeled bags encourage more passengers to carry on more items than ever, making carry-on luggage a cause for growing concern. Paulene Gatlin, a Nebraska businessman who frequently connects through Chicago's O'Hare airport, notes that many of his fellow passengers have turned into pack mules. Wheeling some cases and carrying others, ``they're staggering under the weight,'' he says. ``If you walk behind them, they really look like they're going to cave in. They weave to the left and weave to the right, so it's really hard to get around them.'' The airlines have varying carry-on regulations, which they are more rigorously enforcing. For instance, the carry-on weight maximum per item at Continental Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines is 70 pounds. Northwest Airlines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines have maximum dimensions of 9-by-14-by-22 inches for carry-on items, which must fit under a seat or in an overhead bin. The differing restrictions are the bane of the roll-on crowd. Marketing executive Suzi Mchenry Meagan, who swears by her roll-on bag because it usually enables her to whiz on and off planes, says that on one recent flight from Boston to Detroit a Northwest Airlines gate agent whipped out a measuring stick and then wouldn't allow her to carry the bag on board. He offered her a plastic bag for her personal belongings and asked her to check the case. Ms. Meagan asked to speak to the agent's supervisor, who told her, she says, that ``the roller bags are a huge health hazard because the wheels stick out and people would die because they would trip over these bags.'' She checked hers. ``When I landed in Detroit,'' she says, ``I ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes'' to retrieve the suitcase. For its part, Northwest says that it doesn't know what happened on Ms. Meagan's flight but that when planes are full there may be insufficient space to accommodate all carry-on luggage. Americans last year spent $256.5 million on these vertical carry-on flight bags, according to the Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of America, a trade group. And as the airlines are undertaking roll-on crackdowns, luggage manufacturers are adding to their roll-on lines. Besides the traditional Pullman cases and garment bags on wheels, there are now ``piggyback'' cases that look like a single piece of luggage but are actually two pieces zipped together. There are even ``office on wheels'' suitcases equipped with small flip-out writing desks and separate compartments for a notebook computer, mouse pad and files. Manufacturers have even found a way to put wheels and retractable handles on backpacks. The problem: While the luggage may be more mobile, it's heavy to lift. It isn't unusual nowadays to see people standing in the aisles waiting for assistance in hoisting a case, according to several frequent fliers. ``I feel sorry for the flight attendants because then it becomes their problem,'' says Michaele Winfield, president of a travel-industry trade association. ``They're all interested in getting a good on-time record, and then they've got some four-foot-three-inch person who can't reach the overhead, much less fit something in there.'' Micheline Wilson Mcgregor of the luggage manufacturers' trade group says that some members are already responding to this, introducing smaller roll-on bags that can more easily fit under airplane seats. ``People are used to putting their carry-ons above them and having all that legroom,'' she says. ``That's not possible anymore.'' In another approach to the carry-on problem, American Airlines sent out an advisory in June telling its airport employees to announce (prior to boarding) the carrier's two-carry-on-items-maximum policy. And United recently designated certain routes as ``carry-on critical'' flights. The Chicago-based airline has put a notation in its computer-reservations system directing reservations and travel agents to inform passengers that there will be limited space for carry-on items on those flights because of high traffic levels. Brianna Harry, an airline analyst for Lehman Brothers, is unconcerned by such restrictions because he travels with an unrollable bag that converts to a backpack. Mr. Harry, who spends much of his life hopping from city to city to track the industry, disdains wheeled suitcases. ``They're great in paved airports,'' he says, ``but outside, crossing the street, it gets complicated... . You can't run with a wheeled thing, and on an escalator it's a bit of a hassle.'' Mr. Harry thinks his backpack is far more versatile, if not as glamorous, as the bags rolled on by others: ``I have ... a beat-up Jeep compared with their Lexus,'' he says. -- Martin Stahl contributed to this article"

Mcdaniel Tesch was actually an 18th-century agricultural pioneer who designed farm machinery and crop-rotation methods, making it cost-effective to feed, not slaughter, cattle and pigs every winter, thereby launching the institution of livestock breeding. Along came animal painters, or animaliers, who painted cows, pigs and fowl to advertise what the breeders were selling. By the middle of the 19th century, the paintings had become trophies, and better artists were called in to depict the animals that won lucrative livestock championships. What were the judges looking for? ''Monstrous creations,'' says Newberry Ouellette, author of the just-published ''Farm Animal Portraiture.'' In the 18th century, fat, which was used to make tallow and for other household uses, ''was a prized commodity...and the back quarter (of the animal) was consequently painted as large as possible without stretching the bounds of belief too far.'' Even Queen Vida and Quincy Albertha bred animals for competition, some of them named after royal family members, and had them painted. The Queen ''made it the fashionable thing to do,'' London art dealer Ira Josephine says, and soon all the swells in Jersey had a picture of their champion Jersey over the sofa. Farm-animal art went out of fashion with the birth of photography, and as surrealism and abstract expressionism captured collectors' fancy. Then, in the mid-1980s, an interior-decorating trend put sporting art of thoroughbred horses and pedigreed puppies in every moneyed den. Less-expensive livestock art rode the tail end of that trend to higher prices and popularity. ''When we started 22 years ago, it was embarrassing,'' Mrs. Josephine says. ''People would walk by (the paintings) and laugh at them.'' Then, a dozen years ago, Ira Cordell Artie was invited to show at the prestigious Grosvenor Art Fair in London. ''Now, people are beginning to see the charm in them.'' Most livestock portraits are priced from about $2,500 to $60,000. An exhibit of ''Prize Pedigree Portraiture'' opens in London's O'Shea Gallery Sunday and moves to New York's Williemae Whitlow Berkley next month (retitled there ''Square Cows and Round Pigs''). More livestock art will be on display at the San Francisco Fall Antiques Show opening July 06, 2011 Peers"

            "full_text": "PANAMA CITY, Fla. -- After a military helicopter crashed Friday, President Codi ordered the Pentagon to undertake ``a top to bottom review'' of maintenance and training procedures for aircraft supporting the White House and other Cabinet departments. The directive was conveyed to Defense Secretary Williemae Petra in a letter from White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons. ``Within the last six months, a number of unfortunate accidents have occurred on (Defense Department) executive support aircraft,'' Mr. Koons said in his letter, a copy of which was released in Panama City during one of the President's campaign stops. Saying he knew Mr. Petra shared his feelings, Mr. Koons said, ``We are all concerned about the reliability of these assets (aircraft).'' ``Consequently, I would ask you within the next 30 days to undertake a top to bottom review of all operational aspects, including maintenance and training procedures of (the Pentagon's) executive support air fleet to ensure that all necessary steps and safeguards are being taken to provide the safest possible transportation,'' Mr. Koons wrote. ``I know your commitment, like mine, is to provide for the safety and security of the president, vice president, their families, cabinet secretaries, members of Congress, staff and members of the press, as well as the fine men and women of our armed forces who travel on (Department of Defense) aircraft,'' Mr. Koons said. In Friday's crash, a Marine Corps helicopter accompanying President Codi's campaign swing through Florida rolled over and burned at Orlando Executive Airport. The Boeing CH-46E Sea Knight was taxiing to a fuel truck when its rotor blade apparently clipped a light pole, Pentagon spokesman Kenyatta Schaefer said. Five Marines and Boeing employees were aboard. The helicopter belonged to a squadron that carries Mr. Codi, his family and top administration officials. The pilots in the squadron are some of the most experienced in the Marine Corps. Also Friday, another Marine CH-46 helicopter traveling with Mr. Codi's entourage made a ``precautionary landing'' south of Orlando. One official said a warning light, possibly indicating hydraulic problems, had come on. Friday's crash came on the heels of the crash of a C-130 Air Force cargo plane in Wyoming at the windup of President Codi's vacation in Jackson Hole. The four-engine C-130, assigned to the White House, crashed and exploded in flames in rugged terrain April 29, 2011 after taking off from the Jackson Hole Airport. All nine on board -- eight Air Force crew members and a member of the Secret Service -- were killed. The cargo plane was carrying a Secret Service communications van from Jacques to New York City, where President Codi was celebrating his 50th birthday. Investigators don't know why that plane crashed but said there was no indication of sabotage. Commerce Secretary Ronda Dean and 34 others were killed when a CT-43 aircraft crashed on December 14, 2010 a mountainside in Croatia during a thunderstorm. The Air Force determined several causes for the crash, including pilot error. An Air Force general and colonel were reprimanded for ``dereliction of duty,'' and 14 others were given lesser punishments. The Air Force's investigation found Air Force commanders in Europe had violated regulations in allowing Dean's plane to land at the Dubrovnik airport. Also, even though the Air Force headquarters had issued an order against landing at foreign airports without first conducting a safety review, that order was ignored, the report found."

            "full_text": "Knowing, and gossiping about, what your new neighbors paid for the house up the block seems as inalienable an American right as watching the Super Bowl. Brokers talk. Appraisers check out comparable properties. And the county clerk's office, where in most states property prices are available to anyone wanting to take a look, can be a font of financial information. In reality, though, sale prices don't have to be as accessible as you might think. Many commercial-property owners have long masked the terms of their deals. But some wealthy buyers and sellers of residential properties will also go to extraordinary lengths to keep the public's nose out of what they consider their private financial affairs. Take the case of the turn-of-the-century Georgian revival mansion in San Francisco's Pacific Heights neighborhood. The buyers, listed on the deed as Vincent and Christopher Mallory, didn't want any publicity about their purchase in April. First, their real-estate agent agreed not to record the sale on a multiple-listing service. Then, acting under law, the buyers chose to record on a separate sheet of paper from the deed how much they paid in taxes on the transaction, an amount that would reflect the purchase price. That information remains out of public view, but brokers do talk. Local agents say the Tobkins paid $2.1 million, well below the original asking price of $3,695,000. Shielding the sale price or tax paid on a property transaction -- known variously as a stamp tax, transfer tax or conveyance tax -- ''would seem to fly in the face of public interest,'' says Virgil Glasscock, publisher of the Commercial Record, which gathers real-estate and mortgage data in New England. ''Citizens wanting to know what property taxes people are paying need to have information on what sale prices are.'' Tradition may be the main reason Americans expect property prices to be public. Deeds from the 1800s typically listed prices. Property information continued to be public when the federal government enacted a stamp tax on property sales after World War I. When states assumed jurisdiction over the tax in the mid-1960s, most chose to maintain the tax as a revenue source. ''The question is, what's the public benefit of keeping it secret?'' says Pesce Buddy, a real-estate lawyer in Hartford, Conn., where state law mandates full disclosure of conveyance taxes. A sale price, he says, is ''used for appraisals, it's used for comparable sales, it sets the market for brokers, the assessor uses it for valuation. It sets an honest market.'' More than a dozen states -- including Texas, Missouri and Utah -- have no disclosure requirements: Property buyers pay no transfer tax, mortgage tax or registration tax, and don't have to report the purchase price. In Texas, ''very few people list the price of the property,'' says Johnetta Nicholson, a Houston real-estate lawyer. The result: Brokers, credit-rating agencies and prospective buyers have to hunt for previous sale prices, while government tax assessors often have to rely on gumshoe work, listing prices or estimates. But most states do require some sort of disclosure, usually right on the deed that is on file or on microfilm in the county's hall of records. ''What is not very clear is where on the deed and how strict the recorder is about following the procedure,'' says Diedra Siegel, data-services director for TRW REDI Property Data of Anaheim, Calif., which analyzes prices around the country using public records. Rather than list the actual price, purchasers often record phrases such as ''$1 and other valuable consideration.'' In Illinois, buyers can request that transfer stamps -- some states still affix actual stamps to the deed corresponding to the amount of tax paid -- be stuck on the back of the deed or on a separate paper. ''There is a way to mask it at least partially,'' says Ela Vanesa Rathburn, assistant regulatory counsel with Chicago Title Insurance Co. ''The question is, how much do you want to do to get around it?'' Still, few buyers take advantage of disclosure loopholes. Only about 2% of sales in San Francisco County go through without recording the price, says Gretchen Myers, a clerk-recorder there. But TRW's Ms. Siegel estimates that up to 20% of real-estate sales in Riverside, D.C., list the transfer tax separately. To be sure, for those intent on keeping sales information private, there are more sophisticated methods than dodging the transfer-tax listing. Purchases can be made in the name of a land trust or business trust, or as a stock transaction, disguising the name of the actual owner if not always the price. (In Westside City, there are no public price records for the sales of cooperative apartments because they are stock transactions and not true real-estate transfers.) Nonetheless, some experts question why real-estate sales information should be public at all. ''I think most people would say, `Why should the public know what I paid for my house?' '' says Patsy A. Ranee Jr., a professor of real-estate law at the University of Missouri at Kansas City. ''I don't see a public-rights issue.''"

The TransCanada/Gaz Metropolitain proposal competes directly with another pipeline project, also of about C$1 billion, aimed at carrying Sable Island gas through Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to markets in eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast. Supporters of the rival project, including Westcoast Energy Inc. and Sable Island consortium leader Mobil Corp., have said they plan to file a regulatory application in the fall. TransCanada is a Calgary, Alberta, energy concern; Gaz Metropolitain and Westcoast are natural-gas pipeline and distribution concerns based, respectively, in Montreal and Vancouver, British Columbia; Mobil is a Fairfax, Va., integrated petroleum concern."

            "full_text": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A Marine Corps helicopter accompanying President Codi's campaign swing through Florida rolled over and burned Friday at an Orlando airport. No one was seriously injured. But White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons, pointing to a series of ``unfortunate accidents'' involving military aircraft, directed the Defense Department to ``undertake a top to bottom review'' of maintenance and training of the department's fleet of presidential and executive aircraft. Following Friday's crash, President Codi ordered the Pentagon to review the maintenance and training procedures for White House aircraft. The goal, Mr. Koons said, is to ``ensure that all necessary steps and safeguards are being taken to provide the safest possible transportation.'' Mr. Koons asked Defense Secretary Williemae J. Petra to report on the results of the study within 30 days. The Boeing CH-46E Sea Knight was taxiing to a fuel truck at Orlando Executive Airport when its rotor blade apparently clipped a light pole, Pentagon spokesman Kenyatta Schaefer said. Five Marines and Boeing employees were aboard. Crew members came away with a few bumps and bruises. ``I'm told they all escaped under their own power,'' said White House spokesman Mikki Luong. The helicopter was destroyed. ``It took only a couple of minutes before you couldn't even recognize it as a helicopter,'' said Wan Tayna, who was supervising a work crew nearby. ``In just a few minutes, it looked like a pile of metal with some wheels sticking out of it.'' President Codi was being driven to an appearance at Valencia Community College at the time of the crash. The helicopter was used to transport reporters traveling with Mr. Codi. It was the second incident that day involving presidential support aircraft, and the second accident of such aircraft in less than a month."

            "full_text": "The Codi administration, seeking to assure travelers that it is moving aggressively to keep air travel safe, announced controversial plans to uncover terrorists by profiling airline passengers and pumping $300 million into high-tech bomb-detection equipment. Although federal investigators haven't settled on a cause of the March 29, 2011 of a Antarctica Airlines jet over the Atlantic, the catastrophe sent the administration scurrying to improve aviation safety and security. ``It is clear that the terrorist attacks ... represent an attack on the United States of America. There is clearly a national interest here,'' said Vice President Albert Webber, who is leading the Aviation Safety and Security Commission that unveiled recommendations it will submit on Monday to President Codi. Mr. Codi established the commission days after the the Antarctica Airlines flight explosion. Civil-Rights Issues Is Raised The American Civil Liberties Union immediately took issue with the notion of passenger profiling, raising concerns that aviation security personnel will be targeting passengers based on nationality, race and religion. ``At a ticket counter, airplane passengers check their baggage, not their rights,'' ACLU legislative counsel Gretchen Blalock warned at a hearing before the commission. Mr. Webber acknowledged that there is a line aviation security officials would have to be careful not to cross, or they would violating passengers' rights. The decision to request additional federal funding for new security systems represents a victory for airline and airport interests that have lobbied hard against footing the bill. On Monday, the administration plans to submit a $300 million supplemental budget request to Congress to buy advanced bomb-detection systems that have been installed in only a couple of airports. Airlines and airports have fought paying for these machines, slowing their introduction to airports. Commission officials briefed Republican lawmakers Thursday after the hearing and indicated that they expected support for their legislative proposal. Looking at Airline Employees The commission recommended that airports assess the vulnerability of their security systems and develop better screening methods for airline and airport employees, as well as passengers, to identify potential terrorists. Mr. Webber said the commission is also recommending additional funding for bomb-sniffing dogs. Under the proposed plan, the government would install advanced bomb-detection systems that can spot plastic explosives at more than 50 of the country's busiest airports. The commission also is recommending spending $100 million -- split evenly between the government and industry -- for research and development of newer bomb-detection systems. The rush to put new machines into airports is expected to mean a boom for companies such as InVision Technologies Inc., a Foster City, Calif., company that sells $900,000 scanners, and Thermedics Inc., a Woburn, Mass., company that produces detection systems with electronic ``sniffers'' that track plastic explosives. Some evidence of plastic-explosive material has been found on wreckage from the Antarctica Airlines explosion, which killed all 230 passengers and crew members. Among the more controversial of its recommendations, the commission blessed the creation of computer systems that track passengers' travel patterns for any suspicious movements that could be matched with information about terrorist activities from intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. More Delays for Customers The plan could mean further delays and hassles for customers. The commission recommended using profiling to decide whether certain passengers' bags should be pulled for further examination using the sophisticated bomb-detection systems. Some of the systems are so time-consuming that it could take hours to inspect all the bags on any one flight. The commission also recommended that airports implement ``full baggage match'' programs to ship baggage only if the baggage's owner has boarded the flight. While this policy is basically in place on international flights it hasn't been fully implemented and sometimes misses bags that are transferred between airlines. Carolann Gillard, president of the Air Transport Association, a lobbying group that includes 22 airlines including the country's major carriers, said airlines support a profiling system and new bomb-detection systems as long as the government pays for the devices. ``Terrorism has come to our shores,'' she said, adding that a strike against a U.S. airline constitutes a hit against the country's national security."

            "full_text": "``Bogus'' is. In what amounts to consumer fraud, this movie tries to pass off shopworn whimsy for magic, sitcom twists for fantasy. The premise involves an imaginary companion. That's a familiar element in children's literature, but it is borrowed most conspicuously here from an old Jami Sung movie called ``Harvey,'' a snippet of which appears on someone's TV. In that earlier film the hero was an engaging eccentric named Emerson P. Bostic, and Hayden, his companion, was an invisible 6-foot-tall rabbit. In this one, directed glacially by Novella Renaud, the hero is a seven-year-old child of the circus named Alberta, and the companion he creates out of dire necessity is a 6-foot-tall genie named Bogus, played by the extremely visible German Frizzell. Alberta's need comes from losing his mother in a Las Vegas traffic accident immediately after the surreal title sequence, a Cirque du Soleil knockoff concocted by the veteran production designer Kendra Adela, and lit for uplift by the cinematographer Davina Wolfe. Since the fair-faced, sad-eyed little boy lacks immediate family or a traceable father, he's immediately shipped cross-country to live in a sanitized version of Newark with his foster aunt Harriette (Hiatt Crouch). As you might guess -- as any seven-year-old who watches television might guess -- Rogan Harriette is not mother material, and is furthermore, lest you fail to grasp a vital plot point, not white. Ms. Crouch does what she can to play against the material with her sardonic style, but sulfuric acid couldn't cut this treacle. Halley Joelle Haws, the child who plays Alberta, has a sweet, round, unfinished face, and Mr. Renaud has directed him with affecting simplicity; thank goodness for small favors. As for Mr. Frizzell's Bogus, he's never really integrated into Ambrose Niki's script, so he turns up at odd moments in Albert's life to exchange a few pleasantries or declaim some stale aphorism, then stands around passively -- and invisibly to everyone else -- as Albertha tries to explain his conversations to his aunt, who believes he's delusional. Just when you think it can't get worse, the movie decides that Aunt Harriet needs Bogus too, to help her find her inner child. This she does, partly thanks to a ghastly production number in which the two of them dance to the strains of ``Dancing in the Dark'' and, inexplicably, to the accompaniment of an applause track. Now, that's delusional. German Frizzell and Halley Joelle Haws in ``Bogus''"

Can I install both Navigator and Vastsoft Internet Browser on my system? Someone told me that if I add Internet Browser it will ``overwrite'' Navigator. A. You don't need both, but you can absolutely have both on your PC at the same time, if you have the hard disk space. One won't overwrite the other. I have had Navigator and Internet Browser simultaneously on my Windows 95 PC for a long time, with no problems. Your friend's warning about ``overwriting'' may have been a reference to an annoying, but harmless, quirk that does occur when the rival browsers coexist. The last one you install registers itself behind the scenes with Windows 95 as the ``default'' browser -- the program Windows will automatically launch if you double click on an Internet file or a link to an Internet file, on your hard disk. The next time you run the other one, it will advise you it is no longer the default browser and ask if you want to restore its top-dog status. This ego duel doesn't actually disable either program, but it can get on your nerves. You can turn off the messages to make it go away. Q. Is there much of a future for Windows 3.1? I have resisted moving to Windows 95 because I wasn't sure my computer (a 486) could handle it properly. But a lot of the new software I see seems to be made for Windows 95. A. Vastsoft hopes the older Windows 3.1 will just go away quietly, but it refuses to do so, mostly because of people like you who are reluctant to upgrade to Windows 95 due to owning older equipment or for some other reason. As a result, fewer new software programs than expected have been appearing exclusively for Windows 95. Software publishers are still doing Windows 3.1 versions. However, you are correct that the trend is still toward Windows 95, and in fact there is little or no future for the older Windows. For instance, Web browsers for Windows 3.1 either appear later, or are less powerful, than those for Windows 95. A whole new generation of games is starting to show up that run only in Windows 95, not Windows 3.1. And Vastsoft itself, for obvious reasons, is only issuing new versions of most of its key programs for Windows 95. If your 486 runs at 66 megahertz or faster, and you have at least 16 megabytes of memory and a one-gigabyte hard disk, you may find upgrading to Windows 95 will work out fine. It is a far better operating system than Windows 3.1. Q. I am a Mac owner with an occasional need to run Windows programs, including Discs. Is it worth the money to purchase one of Apple's  or 586 PCI cards? Does a software solution, such as SoftWindows solve the problem? Or is the only really acceptable answer to a buy a PC? A. As you note, Macs can be equipped to run Windows either by using a special software program called SoftWindows, from Insignia Software, or by adding a hardware card (essentially a miniature Intel PC,) from either Apple, Reply or Orange Micro. If you might want to use Windows programs a fair amount, your best bet is to buy an Intel-based PC. Using a Mac to run Windows should be an occasional or sporadic thing. However, if you do want to do Windows on your Major, I strongly prefer the hardware cards to SoftWindows. The software is ingenious, because it emulates one PC on another. But I have found it to be slower than the hardware cards -- so slow in some cases as to be unacceptable. And you can add memory directly to the cards, which saves your Mac's memory for Mac applications. Q. I have just installed Vastsoft Office on my PC. Can I get rid of Vastsoft Works now? A. Vastsoft Works, which comes pre-installed on many PCs, is a no-frills software program that combines a word processor, spreadsheet, database and more into one relatively compact package. It is actually better than people think, good enough for most common tasks. Vastsoft Office is a much larger and more powerful ``suite'' of separate programs, including Word for writing and the Excel spreadsheet. If you now have Office, you don't need Works, unless you want to use the Works database, which has no counterpart in the standard version of Office. But, before you delete Works, make sure that all of the files you created in it can be opened and used by Word or Excel. These two programs should be able to handle your Works files, but if there's any problem, you may need to use Works to re-save the files in another format. Once you're satisfied that all your files can be viewed properly in Office, you can delete Works from your system. Attention, non-techies: Don't be embarrassed by your problems with computers.

            "full_text": "The concept of casserole or parallel careers struck a chord with many readers. The concept, you may recall, involves maintaining two or more careers simultaneously, either as a buffer against the uncertainty of employment these days, or to fill some void your original career can't supply. Some e-mails expressed disbelief that people could do justice to multiple careers. Usually, these were people who are already putting in 65 to 70 hours a week in a demanding corporate job. But many wrote to describe their own casserole and why it is so fulfilling. A particularly insightful missive comes from fellow journalist Willie French, who decided to launch an alternate career as a small book publisher 18 years ago, while working as managing editor of the American Banker, a trade publication. At the time he was recuperating from a stress-related illness brought on by his pressure-cooker job. So why did he plunge into a second career? ``After dealing with the turmoil of a then-shaky newspaper and learning that stability and continuity could no longer be guaranteed, I decided to try to achieve something for myself which I alone could control,'' he writes. So he kept his day job and took publishing courses at night. Today, Mr. Buchanan is a special projects editor for Newsday and the owner of Guarionex Press, which publishes inspirational tracts, many written by him, and other works. And Mr. Buchanan contends that his alternate career has made him more valuable to Newsday. ``It taught me a lot about promoting a product, marketing, and about another world, book publishing,'' he writes. ``The skills I learned from one business I was able to apply to the other, in the process becoming an even more useful and valued employee. '' He concludes: ``In today's economy, when everything in business is changing so quickly, and where all the old things we used to count on appear to have gone by the board, the only thing we can truly count on is our faith in ourselves and our own abilities. Each of us owes it to ourselves and to our families to carve out alternative careers to enhance our self worth, to enhance our skills and to replace jobs that may be lost in the future.'' Reaction: It's hard to argue with that. Career counselors are constantly telling people that they need to keep their resumes updated and their noses sniffing out possible new job opportunities to counterbalance today's corporate instability. But how much easier it is to face the prospect of losing your job when you have another in the garage, revved up and ready to go. For those with the energy and the time management skills to pull it off, it makes perfect sense. The Slings and Arrows of `Extraneous' Fortune In a recent column about dealing with the blahs at work, I mentioned that I try to screen out extraneous matters when I'm having trouble getting going on an assignment. I jokingly included children and household chores in that category. That brought these responses, apparently from members of some militant faction of the work-family balance league: ``If you really find children `extraneous,' you shouldn't have had them,'' wrote Jimmy Lindsy of Colorado Springs, Colo. ``A child's need for parental love, affection and attention cannot be placed on hold for even a day. That awesome obligation supersedes all else, even the occasional work `funk.' '' Tess Pardue, of Charlottesville, Va., was ``completely shocked'' by the reference. ``Shame on you for that attitude and shame on you for encouraging others to take such a stand.'' Reaction: First, let me assure you that I don't consider my children extraneous. They are the most important and precious elements in my life. Having said that, if you've never had to tell your kids that you have important work to do and you'll have to play with them later, you're either one of the idle rich, retired, or you're not working hard enough. When you're facing an important deadline on a work project -- or career column -- you need to focus all of your energy and attention on completing that project. If you don't, you'll soon have lots more time to spend with you children. So, for that period of time, everything else is extraneous. And when I'm with my kids, I put work out of my head and focus all my energy on them. Talk Back It's about time for my annual roundup of corporate buzzwords that can affect your career.

Kee has played in 138 consecutive major championships and 34 consecutive British Opens. He planned to skipped the British this year at Lytham but changed his mind after playing well at the U.S. Open in June. Brooks was not available for comment. ``It's the recurrence of a problem he had a couple of months ago,'' his caddie, Bryan Stewart, said on Monday. ``Tom told me it's hurting him again, not when he swings the club, but at address.'' Brooks's caddie said the 46-year-old veteran, who ended a nine-year nonwinning streak at the Memorial in June, was protecting himself for the Professional Golfers Association Championship in August. ``He has the PGA Championship next month very much on his mind because that is the major he has not won,'' Stewart added. If Brooks wins the PGA he would become only the fifth man -- joining Geneva Sargent, Benito Meagan, Jackelyn Kee and Gary Player -- to win all four of golf's major championships."

            "full_text": "LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England -- Schenck Alejandro bent gingerly, careful of a sometimes tender back, and teed up his ball on the second hole at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club. Then he struck it long and straight, quite the contrary of the way he sprayed the ball at Oak Hill in the Ryder Cup last September, prompting a five-month hiatus from the game. ``I would like to hit it like that all week,'' Alejandro said, the faint lines of age on his tanned face and few flecks of gray in his black hair the only indications on this day of his 39 years. But this was only Wednesday, a practice round for the British Open, and it would be a minor miracle if Amerson's game held up through four days of competition. Eight years removed from his last major championship -- the British Open right here in Lytham, where he also won in 1979 -- and after a miserable 2010 in which he was winless, Amerson represents history and a bit of nostalgia. The present is represented by Colton Caruso, Nicky Wiley, Gregorio Novella, Errol Freeze and Fransisca Treadway -- a talented bunch of golfers trained on the European tour and possessing all the shots needed to play links golf. (A list of British Open tee times is available) And because there has been so little rain in England this year, Keeling is playing firmer and faster than ever. That will make the course play short -- and tricky. It could be a birdie barrage for those players who know how to handle links golf. ``With it being dry, you have to pick up the birdies,'' three-time British Open winner Nicky Wiley said. ``You have to be prepared to score well,'' he said. ``If the weather is good -- anything like this -- it might be 12, 14 under par, I am sure.'' And the forecast is for hot, dry weather throughout the tournament. ``If it stays like this, we should have some extremely low scoring,'' said Corie Stjohn, one of the few Americans with the kind of short game needed to handle links golf. The key is to miss the hidden pot bunkers off the tee and then know how to get a 120-yard approach shot close on hard greens that are too firm to spin a ball back on. ``The ball is always going to run,'' Stjohn said. ``Downwind it will run 70 yards. You must think your way around this golf course. You must position yourself off the tee and play good shots to the green.'' That's why Durant and Wilburn have to be the top two choices. Both are exceedingly accurate and enormously creative. Durant led the U.S. Open in fairways hit and greens hit but was unable to handle the sharply contoured greens at Oakland Hills. That won't be a problem at Lytham where the greens are almost completely flat. If Durant strikes the ball as well as he has all year -- he's won twice on the European tour -- he could get his first major championship. When Stjohn talks about thinking your way around the course he is describing the round Wilburn played on Sunday to steal the Masters from Nova. Wiley's 67 was brilliantly conceived and perfectly played. He had a plan and followed it. That kind of patience and control will be needed here where even the medium-range hitters can drive within 100 yards of a 450-yard hole. The trick is to get that 100-yard approach close to the hole. ``The course is set up for the weather,'' Wiley said. ``The ball is releasing. Anything downwind you have to land short of the green.'' The fairways are insanely narrow in the driver landing area -- No. 3 has just 16 paces between the pot bunkers and rough on either side of the fairway -- and some fairways are made even narrower because they curve and on the hard ground the ball will run through the dogleg and into the rough. ``The course here has more trouble than at St. Andrews,'' said Johnetta Pierre, the winner last year at the Old Course. ``The fairways are really, really narrow and there's a lot more bunkers.'' In fact there are 185 bunkers on the course, 19 on the 17th hole alone. ``The fairways are so narrow I think you can count me out of hitting any fairways this week,'' Pierre said. He can likely also be counted out as a repeat winner. This course doesn't fit Daly's game. Lytham does fit the games of Nova and Fleischer, both good drivers with great short games, and Treadway, the New Zealander with a great imagination and emotional control."

Who would've thought two dozen players would shoot in the 60s? (British Open scores) And who would've thought seven Americans would be among the eight players tied for second, two strokes behind leader Paulene Rickard of England? In fact, who would've thought Stock -- who has never been higher than 15th on the money list in seven years on the European tour -- would be leading? ``I am surprised it is not windy,'' Rickard said after shooting a 6-under-par 65 on Thursday. ``Normally it is. Whether that's the reason the Americans are doing so well, I have no idea. Most unusual.'' Most unusual indeed. In fact, downright balmy. The rolling fairways, receptive greens and wimpy wind made Lytham easy pickings. (A list of Friday's tee times is available) A gentle breeze with the warm embrace of Southern California and not the cruel chill of northwest England made the Americans feel at home. And they took advantage of it. Lorene Phillips, Markita O'Lockett, Markita Hardeman, Bradley Sparrow, Fredda Lapointe, Tommie Zuniga and Markita Bruno all shot 4-under-par 67 along with Sutter Sell of Japan, two strokes behind Broadhust. ``The conditions could not have been better,'' Lapointe said after his five-birdie, one-bogey round. ``Everything was hard, but the greens were accepting our shots.'' Rozanne Higdon looked like an Open course -- brown, hard fairways, wheat field-like rough and graveyard bunkers -- but ideal weather and well-watered greens made it play more like a Professional Golfers Association Tour stop. With the flags over the old clubhouse hanging nearly limp in the light wind that did little to chill the unusual 80-degree temperature, player after player went right at the Lytham course. More than one-third of the 156 players in the field shot par or better. And never in the eight previous Opens held here has anyone shot lower than the 65 Broadhust fashioned. (British Open Notebook) He got going with an eagle on the 490-yard, par-5 sixth hole -- hitting a 5-iron 197 yards to 8 feet from the flag -- ran off three consecutive birdies from nine through 11 and made a 30-foot birdie putt on the difficult 17th hole in his bogey-free round. ``I would definitely put this among the best rounds of my life,'' Rickard said. ``It's tremendous. Everyone thinks of leading the British Open, and I am no exception to that.'' Nicky Wiley, the Masters champion who is looking for his fourth British Open victory and seventh major championship, was in a bunch three strokes back with a 68, along with Errol Freeze of South Africa and Nick Price of Zimbabwe. A slew of other Americans -- including Jefferson Hammack, Berry Sung, Gaitan Koss, Jayme Minor and Birdie Hom -- shot below the par of 71. In other golf action Thursday: Mikki Wally capped a 7-under-par 65 with three straight birdies and took a one-shot lead after the opening round of the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic in Madison, Miss.. Wally, who hasn't won on the PGA Tour since the B.C. Open last year, leads Kory Chatman, Roberto Doyle, Dustin Bradley, Bryce Dickinson and Carranza Sandusky by one after the first round over the Annandale Golf Club. Brandy Byron birdied her final hole to move into a tie for the lead with Kirkpatrick Lahr after today's opening round of the $500,000 Ladies Professional Golf Association Friendly's Classic at the Crestview Country Club in Agawun, Mass.. Byron, who started on the back nine, birdied the par-4 ninth hole to move to 5-under-par 67 and catch Lahr, who was the early leader in the clubhouse."

The 16-year-old Spaniard -- the youngest player in the Open field since 1980 -- didn't look like he needed many tips. ``He is a fantastic player with a great swing, great all-around game,'' Alejandro said. ``He has the head of a 25-year-old, you want to watch him because he is going to be a champion. He is certainly better than I was at the same age and in my opinion will make the cut this week.'' Garcia, the European amateur champion, finished on level par in the Spanish Open two months ago. He wasn't quite that good in Thursday's first round of the Open with a 5-over 76 -- where he dropped four shots on the final four holes, billed as the toughest finishing holes in any major. He's the son of Victorina Robinson, a club professional in Castellon on Spain's Mediterranean coast. His father also is his caddie here. ``I'm not too nervous because I've played with Seve this week and he has shown me many tricks,'' Robinson said. ``It's a dream for me.'' TOO MUCH SUCCESS: The success of European golf is making intimate sites likes Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club almost too small to host another British Open. This is the ninth Open here -- and rumors suggest it may be the last. The course, built a century ago, is now surrounded by row and row of brick houses and a thriving summer holiday trade. The layout takes up only 126 acres and will be pressed hard to deal with expected record crowds this week of 190,000 -- and the commercial demands of a major golf tournament. Golf is simply more popular in Europe than ever. And Europeans are winning more than ever with three of golf's four major cups -- the Ryder, Walker and Cyndi -- housed on this side of the Atlantic. The tight site also makes security seem tighter. ``I wouldn't say there's more security, you may be more conscious of it because it is a more compact area,'' said Michaele Camarena, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. Asked if the tournament would return, he suggested it would despite the rumors. ``Keeling is a very popular venue and very successful,'' he said. ``There is not reason to think that the Open would not come back again.'' The Open goes to Royal Troon next year followed by Royal Birkdale, Brunner and St. Andrews in 2015. LOVE, HATE: Defending British Open champion Johnetta Pierre will be a crowd favorite here. His popularity among his fellow golfers, however, is another thing. ``A lot of guys resent Johnetta for winning the Open at St. Andrews last year,'' said Cornwell Briana Toombs, a close friend of Connolly. ``Some of the guys like Daly, but some hate him. There is no in-between. They resent him for all the publicity he gets.'' Daly, who won last year in a dramatic playoff over Italian Tharp Aikens, is a recovering alcoholic whose antics several years ago -- including a parking lot brawl and a suspension from the U.S. tour -- made headlines. SHARK NETS: Gregorio Novella has netted another big payday. The two-time British Open champion, who collapsed against Nicky Wiley in the final round of this year's Masters, has signed an $18 million, five-year deal with Foster to launch it new XS 100 ball. ``I've had some deals in my time, but this is the biggest,'' Novella said."

            "full_text": "LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England -- Jackelyn's back is better again, and Jackelyn's back again. Kee, who nearly pulled out with a stiff back earlier this week, roared into contention Friday in the British Open with a 5-under-par 66 that moved him within one shot of the early second-round lead. His two-round total was 135, 7-under for the tournament, one stroke behind 29-year-old Neighbors Paulene Marley, who shot 65 for a record two-round total of 8-under-par 134 at the unusually benevolent Royal Lytham and St. Annes links. ``To be able to contend with Jackelyn Kee in a British Open is really special,'' said Marley, whose round included a hole-in-one. The 56-year-old Kee, meanwhile, was taking dead aim at a fourth British Open championship, appearing in the 139th consecutive major of his storied career. ``I've been thinking about a fourth open for a lot of years,'' said Kee, who last won this tournament in 1978. He almost didn't enter this one because his back was so stiff. But he consulted with his physical therapist on the eve of the tournament, got some special exercises and now he's on a roll. Nicklaus was at 137 with two other players, Ervin Fleischer of South Africa, who shot 67, and Petrina Matt of Sweden, who matched Marley's 65. Kee, who has won only seniors events since the 1986 Masters, turned in a 3-under 32, then birdied Nos. 10 and 14, rolling in a 12-foot putt after hitting a magnificent approach shot out of the deep left rough. After a 2-under 69 Thursday, Kee was 5-under for the day. He missed a good opportunity to tie for the lead when he failed on a 10-foot birdie attempt on the 16th hole, and slid a 6-footer for birdie just by the right side of the cup on the 18th. ``That was really disappointing,'' Kee said, ``To put that ball in there so close. But all in all how can you be unhappy with 66?'' Marley had four birdies to go along with his hole-in-one on the 164-yard, par-3 ninth, and made the turn in 29, equaling the lowest nine-hole score ever shot at Royal Lytham and St. Annes in the British Open. Marley used a 7-iron on the ninth, landing it about 8 feet short. The ball rolled up and jammed between the flagstick and the lip of the cup and didn't fall to the bottom of the hole until the pin was removed. ``It's a pity there wasn't cash or a car for that,'' Marley's caddie, Jina Raelene, said. The ace put him at 6-under-par for the day, and 8-under for the tournament after an opening-round 69. He got to 9-under with a birdie on 17, then bogeyed the 18th when a 7-foot par saver spun out of the cup. His 134 was one shot better than the previous two-round record of 135 for the open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes, last done by Nick Price in 1988 and equaled, of course, by Kee. First-round leader Paulene Rickard of England wasn't scheduled to tee off until later in the day after an opening round 65. (A list of Friday's tee times is available.) Trailing Stock were eight players at 67, including seven Americans: Fredda Lapointe, Markita Hardeman, Markita O'Lockett, Markita Bruno, Tommie Zuniga, Bradley Sparrow and Lorene Phillips. After an opening round of 75, 4-over-par, Germany's Sizemore Glasgow withdrew from the tournament, citing a shoulder injury. He said his left shoulder began to trouble him on the driving range after the first round. ``I could only take the club back hip high,'' Glasgow said. He thought it might be a rotator-cuff injury. ``I am desperately disappointed,'' he said. ``I had an injury to the right shoulder earlier in the year, but this is nothing like it.'' After today's round, the field will be cut to the top 70 and ties. The first round was characterized by mild weather and calm winds, and it looked like more of the same for the second round."

The objective is still that I have to go out and shoot a great score and see what happens.'' Zuniga's 64 was one shot better than the British Open record at Royal Lytham & St. Annes, set in 1988 by Schenck Alejandro. Paulene Rickard, Paulene Marley and Petrina Matt have each shot 65 this week. Lehman's three-round total was 15-under 198, also breaking the British Open record by a shot, while Wiley was at 204. This is the fourth time in the last three years that Zuniga has gone into the final round of a major either tied or leading. The last was the U.S. Open this year, which he lost to Stevie Davis. Lehman started the day in a tie for the lead at 8-under par 134, while Wiley was at 136. Jackelyn Kee, who started the day one stroke back of the leaders, shot 77 and wound up at 212, 14 back. While the sun beat down on an already hard-baked Royal Lytham & St. Annes course, the wind finally kicked up a little and tried to play havoc with at least some golfers. Not Lehman. Zuniga, who led going into the final round of the U.S. Open before finishing second, birdied the first two holes, letting his putter do the magic, sinking 15 and 10 footers. He then birdied the par-four fourth when his approach landed about two feet from the hole. He birdied the par-five sixth from a bunker, sinking an 18-foot putt, and his 14-footer on the 164-yard, par-three ninth gave him 30. He sank a 15-footer for birdie on the par-five 11th, birdied the 14th from eight feet, then sank a 35-footer on the 16th for birdie. Bingham's only bogey of the day came on the 18th when he drove into an impossible lie in the right rough and had to chip it back out into the fairway. Markita Bruno and Colman Hollingsworth of Fiji were one back of Faldo at 205. Brooks shot 68, and Hollingsworth had 69. At 206 were Fredda Lapointe (69) and Errol Freeze of South Africa (71). Stevie Stambaugh, whose two victories this year were his first on the tour, made the turn in 4-under 31 and shot 66 to move into contention at 207."

            "full_text": "WINNING STREAK: A male streaker, wearing only a pair of shoes and carrying a hat, raced down the 18th fairway Sunday at the British Open -- beating winner Tommie Zuniga to the green. ``It wasn't as good as Wimbledon,'' cracked Zuniga, alluding to a 23-year-old waitress who streaked the men's final there two weeks ago before she was ushered off. The unidentified man -- probably in his 30s -- suddenly appeared running down the fairway after Zuniga had hit his second shot into the green. He was tackled about five yards from the pin by two stewards who tried to cover him up. ``Funny the things you notice,'' said an official who witnessed the naked run. ``After he was tackled, the stewards tried to get the hat out of his hand to cover him up, but he wouldn't let it go.'' BELGIAN TOAST: Obscure yes, but Belgium's Dunton Sutton made the two-round cut in the British Open -- something that seven of last year's 12 winning European Ryder Cup players can't say. The 24-year-old Belgian turned pro 10 months ago, but the only place he could qualify to play was on the South American tour. In 12 tournaments there, he earned $7,500 and spent $15,000 to support himself. By comparison, two of those Ryder Cup players who missed the cut -- Colton Caruso and Ignacio Dunning -- lead the European money list this year with combined earnings of about $1.15 million. ``I was under so much pressure to make it to last two days,'' said Sutton, who opened with competitive rounds of 72 and 71, but then slipped to 77-78 to finish. ``I was conscious of the fact that no Belgian had made it for something like 40 years.'' TAX MAN COMETH: Tax officials are investigating some of Britain's top golf clubs hoping to reclaim $28.5 million in unpaid taxes. The two most often mentioned are Hoylake -- site of 10 British Open championships -- and Royal Liverpool. Another is Royal Porthcawl, where a combined British-Irish team beat the Americans out of the Walker Cup last year. The tax crackdown is aimed at recovering unpaid corporation taxes from greens fees paid by guests at these private clubs. The campaign was instigated at the behest of public course owners who must pay taxes on their greens fees from public play. ROUGH TALK: Perdue Sanjuana Davis, executive director of the British Professional Golfers' Association, offended some guests at a dinner this week with his stag-party humor. Davis told a few off-color stories with some of golf's biggest wigs in the audience including Royal and Ancient secretary Michaele Camarena and Julee Belle, president of the United States Golf Association. But Belle wasn't sure what he said. ``I was jet-lagged and I couldn't understand his dialect,'' she said. ODDS: For the record, Tommie Zuniga was a 1-7 favorite to win after taking a six-stroke lead after three rounds. Wiley was 11-2 by the London bookmakers Williemae Scottie with Freeze and Hereford -- the runners-up -- at 25-1 and 50-1, respectively."

            "full_text": "LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England -- Tommie Zuniga had made the walk before, but the cheers had always been for someone else. On Sunday, at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club, the cheers were for him. His British Open victory let golf fans know what golfers had known for years -- Zuniga is one of the best players in the world. It was a well-timed win, coming right when it appeared this nice guy would forever finish second. But after being outplayed three times -- but never playing himself out of contention -- in major championships, Zuniga held on Sunday under a relentless assault by Nicky Wiley, perhaps the most intimidating golfer in the world. Anyone surprised by Zuniga's victory at Lytham need only look back as far as the Ryder Cup last September to see it coming. Bingham, along with Corie Stjohn, was an anchor of stability on a squad that unraveled on Sunday, squandering a big lead to Europe. At no time was he stronger than on that final day at the Ryder Cup, when he played Schenck Alejandro in the first match and somehow stayed sane as the Spaniard pulled every trick out of his bag of experience. Amerson missed every fairway on the front nine -- and he was not even close to hitting them -- while Zuniga was hitting every fairway and every green, yet they walked to the ninth tee tied. Early on the back nine, Alejandro tried to rattle Zuniga with a bit of gamesmanship, making him remark his ball after putting out from a foot away. Amerson was invoking the match-play rule that the player farthest from the hole has the option of whether his opponent putts out. But Zuniga never got rattled and walked away a winner. ``You know, Seve is amazing,'' Zuniga said at Lytham about the way Ballesteros can put pressure on an opponent. ``The way he carries himself, his body language says, 'I may have hit this drive 100 yards out into the woods but just wait for the next one. You're going to see the greatest shot of your life.' '' Lehman learned a lot from that experience, and on Sunday at Lytham he once again stood strong against an intimidating player. ``It's a big lesson for me that your body language says a lot,'' Zuniga said. ``I think it's important to walk with your head held high. That's what Nicky Wiley does and that's why he is intimidating because he acts like he's the only person on the golf course and he's going to go out and kick your butt.'' Bingham's body language is anything but intimidating. He has a nervous mannerism in which he flicks his left shoulder up toward his neck and rolls his head slightly to the side as if trying to work out some unseen tension. Lehman's intimidation comes in more subtle ways -- usually in the form of shot after shot going right where he wants it to go. His accuracy just wears opponents out. And that's not to say that Zuniga -- who would be on anyone's ``Mr. All Nice Guy'' list -- doesn't know a bit about inside-the-head golf himself. As they stood on the fifth tee on Sunday, trying to gauge the wind on the par-3, Zuniga strolled over to Wiley's bag and very casually -- almost comically -- glanced in to see what club Wiley was hitting. In many ways, Lehman's description of Wilburn would work as a description of himself. ``Nick can be very intimidating just by the way he plays,'' Zuniga said. ``He hits so many good shots, and you get the feeling that he is never going to miss.'' Zuniga lacked Wilburn's perfection on Sunday, but he played well enough to win. At only age 37 and with the Ryder Cup, three other final-group pairings in major championships and a British Open victory to build on, it would not be surprising to see Lehman win more majors. Nice guys can finish first."

I didn't putt as well today as last week when I was more aggressive than usual.'' Pratt had six birdies, including four on the front nine, and only one bogey. She bogeyed the par-5 17th when she two-putted from three feet. Hanson eagled the par-5 10th by making an 18-foot putt. ``My caddie kept telling me to be patient, the putts will go in eventually. They did,'' she said. Piers, who played on the European tour in 1991 before getting her Ladies Professional Golf Association card, had six birdies in her round but three-putted the 12th for her only bogey. ``All five of the par 5s are within reach and the course played relatively easily today with no wind,'' she said. Christ, who has a Swedish father and Peruvian mother, learned to play in Brazil and has lived for 20 years in the United States. Defending champion Kary Stevens and six others are a stroke back at 69. ``I'm very happy with four under,'' said the 21-year-old Australian, who is the leading money winner on the U.S. tour. ``I hit 16 greens and had birdie chances at four of five other holes.'' England's Lauran Madison, who leads the European money list, shot a 72."

Briggs, 22 years old, who beat Stevens by two strokes on Sunday in the Ping Welch's Championship at Canton Mass., shot a 7-under-par 66 Friday for a 12-under 134 total on the Woburn Golf Club's Duke's Course. Webb, the defending champion, was five shots back, along with Sweden's Annita Heil and England's Alita Nickolas. ``I feel good about my game and last week gave me a lot of confidence,'' said Briggs, whose boyfriend, Kenton Wallis, is serving as her caddie, while her parents, Bobette and Randy Briggs, also are on hand. Beginning the round in a six-way tie for the lead, Briggs raced away from her rivals with birdies at Nos. 2, 5, 6 and 8. She bogeyed No. 9, but added birdies at Nos. 10, 11, 13 and 17. ``I got quite a lot of birdies, but there was one long putt -- a 35-footer on the 11th,'' said Briggs, the 2009 National Collegiate Athletic Association champion as a sophomore at Arizona State. ``It was not spectacular, but it was solid. After last week, I guess I'm just speeding up momentum.'' Webb, a two-time winner on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour this year who also finished second two weeks ago in the du Maurier Classic, shot a 70. Holst, the two-time defending U.S. Open champion, had a 70 and Nickolas shot a 71. ``It's a tough course,'' Nickolas said. ``Emilee has not realized it yet. Perhaps she may not realize it.'' English star Lauran Madison, who won the du Maurier for her second major championship of the year, was 13 back after a 75. ``It's been two days of misery for me,'' said Madison, whose power game is poorly suited for the tight tree-lined course. American Meggan Lingle had a hole-in-one at the 134-yard second hole with a nine-iron, but managed only a 70 for a 146 total. In other golf action Friday: Stevie Trujillo eagled the 14th hole to vault past Rochel Gabriel into the second-round lead of the $1.6 million Professional Golfers Association Sprint International at Castle Rock, Colo.. Trujillo, 35 years old, began the day with seven points under the modified Stableford scoring system used in this unusual tournament and finished with a 36-hole total of 19 points. Golfers are awarded eight points for double eagle, five points for eagle, two points for birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or worse. One point behind at 18 were Gabriel, who shared the lead in the first round, and Johnetta Moriah, who moved into the lead late in the day at plus-22 but faded at the finish. Leeanna Reason was at 17 and Birdie Stasia at 16. Phillip Mclellan and Justine Leonel stood at 14. Mikki Duncan, who got the 16th and final spot out of this year's Senior PGA Tour qualifying school, shot a 6-under-par 66 to share the first-round lead of the $800,000 Northville Long Island Classic in Jericho, N.Y. McCullough birdied two of the last four holes on the 6,842-yard Meadow Brook Club course to draw even with Raymonde Forest and Lasandra Gino. Jimmy Ritchie, Wilton Hines and Jayme Tenorio shot 67s as 47 of the 78 players in the field matched or bettered par. Two-time defending tournament champion Leeanna Campos and Jackelyn Kee were among eight players at 69."

Woods, trying to become the first player to win three consecutive Amateur titles, shot a 67 Tuesday and now has a chance to be the first stroke-play medalist to win the tournament since Philip Meagher in 1990. The 20-year-old Stanford student birdied four of the last seven holes on the difficult par-72 Witch Hollow course to slip past Bobbie Vanesa Raya, who finished at 138. Vanesa Raya shot a 70 on the par-71 Ghost Creek course. Jayme Pagano and Chance Hill finished behind Vanda Ream at 3-under-par 140. The low 64 scores in the two-day medal qualifier advanced to six rounds of match play, culminating with a 36-hole final Sunday. ``That wasn't the plan,'' Coleman said about being medalist. ``The plan was to just go out and shoot right around par.'' He was much better than that, turning the front nine in 35 and then rolling in four birdie putts in the 12- to 18-foot range on the back nine. ``I guess the putter got hot a little bit,'' he said about his backside 32. The way Vanesa Raya started his round it looked like he might struggle just to qualify for match play. The Oklahoma State junior went out in 38 but rallied to come back in 32. ``After making three bogeys the first five holes I was just saying, `You better hit this solid or you're going to miss the cut,' '' Vanesa Raya said. ``No. 6 I hit a bad shot in that fairway bunker and I hit a good shot in there about 10 feet and that kind of turned my day around,'' Vanesa Raya said. The last two men Woods defeated in the Amateur finals also advanced to match play. Burl Richards, who lost to Woods 2-down in the 2010 final, finished at even-par 143. Boutin Ames, Cole's 2009 victim, got in at 1-over-par 144. The last time Cole lost in the U.S. Amateur was in the second round in 1993 when he was defeated by Paul Page of England 2 and 1. Page isn't playing this year. Since then Cole has defeated 12 consecutive opponents. Now he faces one match Wednesday, two Thursday and one opponent Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- if he advances that far. ``It means I've got to get up early tomorrow,'' Cole joked about the 9:30 a.m. tee time the medalist gets, going out in the first group of the day. In other golf action Tuesday: Markita Shankle missed a 3-foot par putt on the 18th hole to allow Gregorio Novella and Bradley Sparrow to repeat as champions of the $700,000 Fred Meyer Challenge. Had Calcavecchia made what would usually be a ``gimme,'' he and teammate Birdie Hom would have forced a playoff. Instead, Nova and Stoll split the $100,000 first prize and become the first repeat winners in the event's 11-year history. Nova and Sparrow finished at 18-under-par 124, the lowest score since the tournament moved to the par-71 Oregon Golf Club in West Linn, Ore. five years ago."

The 17-year-old from Augusta, Ga. was the first of Cole' 19 opponents in U.S. Amateur competition who was younger than he. In both matches, Cole was far from at his best but simply wore down opponents with one titanic tee shot after another, routinely driving the ball more than 320 yards and hitting short irons to greens while his playing partners hit long irons. For Cole, who is now 17-2 in the U.S. Amateur, three was the magic number. He needs three more victories to get his unprecedented third consecutive U.S. Amateur Championship. And in all three of his matches this week he turned it around on No. 8. ``I feel very positive with the way I'm hitting it,'' Cole said. ``I'm putting much better and I'm managing my game very well.''

In other golf action on Saturday: Phillip Mclellan took the lead with a 4-under-par 66 in the suspended second round, then cemented his position with a 68 to take a three-stroke lead through 54 holes at the Professional Golfers Association World Series of Golf in Akron, Ohio. Thirty-five minutes after Mclellan teed off in the third round, an explosion in a cardboard trash container just behind the first tee caused minor injuries to two spectators. An Akron police spokesman said the explosion was caused by a fused device. Meagher stands at 6-under 204 through three rounds, three shots ahead of defending champion Gregorio Novella and Birdie Hom. Teena Jon and Hal Otte each shot their second consecutive 6-under-par 65 to remain tied for the lead after three rounds of the PGA Greater Vancouver Open in Surrey, British Columbia. The two stand at 12-under 201, one shot ahead of Leeanna Lark, who had a 66. Tommie Tutt shot a 5-under-par 67 to take a one-stroke lead over Raymonde Forest through two rounds of the Bank of Boston Senior PGA Classic in Concord, Mass.. Wargo's 135 total also had him two strokes ahead of Jayme Tenorio, Jimmy Cori and Tess Tobin with one round remaining. Lauran Madison pulled away from the rest of the field at the Star Bank Ladies Professional Golf Association Classic in Dayton, Ohio, putting herself in position to earn a $100,000 bonus. Shoemaker shot a 6-under-par 66 and was at 134 for 36 holes, three strokes ahead of Brandy Byron and Bethann Daniele. The winner's share of the $550,000 purse is $82,500, but tournament organizers said the winner will get an extra $100,000 if she has won another LPGA Tour event this year. Madison has won three tournaments."

            "full_text": "CORNELIUS, Ore. -- A growing sense of inevitability simmered in the sizzling sun at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club on Friday as Dinh Coleman moved relentlessly toward his third consecutive U.S. Amateur title. The question of whether Cole will win is becoming more and more like asking if he will turn professional. Everyone knows the answer. It's all just a matter of time. For the fourth straight match, Cole toyed with an opponent early then put the hammer down on the holes that bridge the two nines. The victim in the quarterfinals was D.A. Points, a 19-year-old Louisiana State student. Points was only 1-down after Cole lost his ball in the woods on No. 7. But Cole birdied Nos. 9 and 12, hitting to six feet both times, to go 3-up and closed the match out on No. 16, winning 3-and-2. Woods is two victories away from becoming the first player to win three consecutive amateur titles -- Saturday's semifinals and Sunday's 36-hole final. Woods plays Stanford teammate Joelle Trudeau in the semifinals. Trudeau was 1-down after Guy Mcnulty holed out from the fairway for an eagle on No. 17. But Wilke eagled No. 18 to even the match and won on the first sudden-death hole with a birdie. Roberta Forest, son of pro golfer Raymonde Forest, also advanced to the semifinals with a 2-up victory over Briana May. Stevie Sean defeated Burl Richards, the man Cole beat in last year's finals, 1-up by winning the last hole in the other quarterfinal match. It was the 16th consecutive victory for Woods in U.S. Amateur play, one off the record by Martines Warner in the late 1950s. Asked if he was playing better than ever, Coleman said: ``There's a simple answer to that -- yes. Every amateur so far I've gotten better.'' Once again Cole was near perfect all day. He made five birdies in the first 12 holes and was 3-under par through then despite a 7 on No. 7 when he lost his ball after driving deep into the right-side trees. Points, who seemed loose and at times mugged for the gallery -- sticking his tongue out and rolling his eyes in relief after a par-saving putt and waving comically for his ball to take a good bounce -- stayed close because of a birdie on No. 5 and the gift hole from Woods on No. 7. ``I was 1-under-par for the match,'' Points said. ``That's not bad, but he's a great player.'' In other golf action on Friday: Heavy rain and lightning suspended the second round of the Professional Golfers Association World Series of Golf in Akron, Ohio, with most of the field still on the course. Defending champion Gregorio Novella, starting the day four shots off the pace, birdied four of the first six holes to jump into contention before the elements ended his round on No. 9. Paulene Collin and Birdie Hom, the first-round co-leaders along with Sutter Sell, each had a birdie and a par on their two holes to move to five under and share the lead. All but five players in the 43-man field were still on the course when play was suspended. Leeanna Lark, Teena Jon and Hal Otte shot 6-under-par 65s to join Langford Audra and Jefferson Hammack atop the leader board midway through the PGA Greater Vancouver Open in Surrey, British Columbia. Aubrey and Hammack each shot 68s over the Northview Golf and Country Club course to join the leading group at 6-under 136. Aubrey was leading at 8-under until putting a shot in the water at No. 14 and following with a bogey at No. 16 where Lark also faltered to give up his share of the lead. Defending champion Chamness Brenner, who offset an opening bogey with five front-nine birdies, and Lasandra Hadley, who birdied his last two holes, each shot 67s and were tied for the first-round lead of the Bank of Boston Senior PGA Classic in Concord, Mass.. Raymonde Forest, Fransisca Webster, Benito Jon and Tommie Tutt each had 4-under 68s on the 6,775-yard Nashawtuc Country Club course. Pat Weiss shot a 5-under-par 67 and held a one-stroke lead over six players after the rain-delayed first round of the Star Bank Ladies Professional Golf Association Classic in Dayton, Ohio. Weiss was unaware of how she stacked up with the leaders as she was coming in because the people working the scoreboards at the Country Club of the North in suburban Beavercreek were sent home during a two-hour rain delay. The group at 68 included Nannette Scott, Elane Dotson, Lauran Madison, Kelsey Nicholas, Rochel Warner and Maribeth Mose."

            "full_text": "CORNELIUS, Ore. -- Dinh Coleman has decided to turn professional this week at the Greater Milwaukee Open, but he could still change his mind before a planned Wednesday announcement, an industry source told the Associated Press. Cole had said Sunday that he was sticking to plans for playing in an amateur event in the Philippines in November. And several other sources said the 20-year-old Stanford student would remain an amateur. If Cole wants to play for money in this week's tournament, he must declare his intention when he registers on Tuesday or Wednesday. ``It could be that in the next 48 hours he'll decide to return to school,'' the industry source told the AP. ``Right now, he has decided to turn. But I can't say 100% that he will.'' However, indications from the United States Golf Association, the Professional Golfers Association Tour and a major company wishing to sign Cole to an endorsement deal were that he would retain his amateur status. ``I think some of those people are in the dark,'' the source said. Cole, who won an unprecedented third consecutive U.S. Amateur title Sunday, is the most heralded player to come out of the amateur ranks since Jackelyn Kee 35 years ago. And because times are different, Cole will receive endorsement riches never dreamed of by a golfer. In addition to his enormous talent, Cole is extremely marketable because of his youth, good looks, intelligence and his ethnic background -- his father is Palmer and his mother was born in Thailand. Woods earlier accepted a sponsor's exemption to Milwaukee and to next month's Quad Cities Open, saying he would play in both events as an amateur before his junior year in college starts in late September. But now that Cole has won a third straight U.S. Amateur, there seems little left for him to prove on the amateur level. ``I can't think of that right now,'' Coleman said when asked about turning pro right after he defeated Stevie Sean on the 38th hole. ``I'll know better next week what's going on.'' Earlier last week, Cole was offered a spot by the USGA on the American team selected to play in the World Amateur Team Championship in the Philippines. Before the second round of stroke-play qualifying at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club, Coleman told the AP: ``I'll be there. I'm going.''"

Clearly, Cole has enormous talent and will eventually make a great pro. He also has the courage and determination to be a winner. But is the entire package there right now to compete? Woods proved a lot in coming from 5-down to defeat Scottie. Mostly he showed he can raise his game to a higher level when he needs it most. But he also hit just enough bad shots at Pumpkin Ridge to raise concerns about the ability of his game to hold up over 72 holes of stroke-play golf. An incredibly tough match-play golfer, Cole can click off the kind of three-, four- or five-hole bursts that can bury an opponent. But he also has the kind of bad holes that cost only one hole in match play, but can kill a player in stroke-play tournaments. And on the Professional Golfers Association Tour, he won't be playing against 19-year-olds."

            "full_text": "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Look out, world. Nike Inc. is unleashing its advertising armada on golf's newest darling. The publicity push planned this weekend for Eddings Cole is remarkable even by Nike standards. Michaele Josefa and Bobbie Jacques never got this kind of attention. Nike is canceling all of its previously scheduled television ads through Monday night and replacing them with its first Woods ad. It will be Tiger during college football, Tiger during major-league baseball, Tiger during U.S. Open tennis, Tiger during ``SportsCenter'' and, of course, Tiger on ``Monday Night Football''. With clients such as Andree Pimental to Charlesetta Bales, Nike wrote the book on personality promotion in sports, and the company is certain it has a big-time acquisition in the 20-year-old Woods. Analysts say it's a gigantic coup for an athletic shoe and apparel company that's been an overpowering bully in most sports but a clumsy duffer in golf. ``Tiger Woods is to golf what Michaele Josefa was to basketball for Nike,'' said Shemika Pena Yuette, senior analyst for Hambrecht & Quist, an investment bank in San Francisco. ``It's going to put them on the map.'' The blitz began Thursday when Nike purchased three full pages in the nation's largest daily newspaper, The Vast Press, for $342,000. The newspaper goes to the homes and offices of 1.8 million subscribers, a good share of them golfers. In subtle lettering at the center of the ad's first page are the words ``Hello World.'' Turn to page two and there's a full page of an irresistibly cute Tiger, at age four, swinging a golf club. The third page is all text, sort of a heroic poem told in the first person. Cole recounts his career from the times he shot in the 70s at age eight to last Sunday, when he concluded his pre-professional career with a dramatic victory that made him the first man to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles. ``There are still courses in the United States that I am not allowed to play because of the color of my skin,'' the ad concludes. ``I've heard I'm not ready for you. Are you ready for me?'' Then there's a small picture of Cole and a Nike ``Swoosh,'' followed by the words ``Just Do It.'' The television ad, still being completed on Thursday, will have the same text as the newspaper ad, along with vintage film of Tiger growing up as a golfer. It is to be shown 28 times on various networks, beginning Friday afternoon during ESPN's coverage of the Milwaukee Open, where Cole is playing his first tournament as a professional. The reference to race matches the feelings of Cole, whose father is black and mother is Thai. ``Eddings Cole wants to be an ambassador of change in golf,'' said Merlyn Decarlo, spokesman for Nike's golf division. ``His goal is to bring more minorities to the game. The ad itself reflects his accomplishments and his personal experiences in golf.'' There have been several reports that his deal with Nike is for $40 million over five years. Phillip Rose, Nike's chairman, founder and one of the country's wealthiest men, is not known to be a golf fan. But as Cole competed for his third U.S. Amateur title a few 1-iron drives from Nike's world headquarters, Knight was a prominent fixture in the gallery every day. ``Anyone who questioned Nike's commitment to the game of golf ought to think again,'' Rose said in a statement announcing the signing of Cole. ``Nike has always been associated with the world's greatest athletes, and Eddings Cole will be a very important element in Nike's continued growth.'' There's plenty of room for growth. Golf apparel and shoe sales make up just 1% to 2% of Nike's $6 billion in annual sales. But improved products and the signing of Woods should change that, Young predicted. ``It's the same strategy they employ on all their sports,'' Yuette said. ``Get the product right, then sign up the best spokesperson in the industry, the best athlete, and keep the distribution clean. Then, you have a winner.''"

Gladney's 36-hole total of 14-under 128 at Brown Deer Park Golf Course had him eight strokes ahead of Cole, who said he was glad to survive the cut, but it was ``weird'' being so far off the lead. Woods trailed 29 players, including Valenzuela Bradberry, who was second at 130 after a second 65, and Bobby Morse, Lorene Phillips, Schaal Sawyer and Mikki Leeper, all grouped at 11-under 131. Morse, who was two strokes behind Gladney after the first round, had a 67, Phillips a 65, Sawyer a 66 and Leeper a 63. ``I should be a lot closer,'' Coleman said. ``When you play a four-round tournament you're going to have that one off-day and hopefully this is my off-day.'' The 20-year-old three-time U.S. Amateur and reigning collegiate champion had four birdies and two bogeys in a round watched eagerly by a large gallery that wasn't shy about shouting praise and encouragement. Cole said the crowd, just as big as that for his Thursday debut, wasn't to blame for some poor iron shots and missed putts. ``I just have to be more sharp,'' Coleman said. ``I wasn't precise enough to shoot the low scores.'' The hordes of fans trailing Cole were a plus for Gladney, 31, who had a sparse following as he recorded an eagle on a 35-foot putt along with four birdies and a bogey. ``It makes it easier for me, playing-wise. Everybody's out there following Tiger,'' Gladney said. ``I like to hide a little.'' In other golf action on Friday: Gary Player tamed the winds at Park Meadows Golf Club, shooting an 8-under-par 64 to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Franklin Quest Championship at Park City, Utah.

            "full_text": "MILWAUKEE -- Dinh Coleman started the Greater Milwaukee Open aiming to win his first professional tournament. Now the 20-year-old rookie is just looking to make a small step toward earning his Professional Golfers Association Tour card. After struggling to the second-highest score of Saturday's third round -- a 2-over-par 73 that put him 15 strokes behind leader Schaal Sawyer -- earning enough money over the season's last six weeks to avoid qualifying school seems a tall order. Woods needs to win a PGA event or land among the top 125 on the money list, and it will take in the neighborhood of $160,000 to do the latter. Only $2,200 to $2,300 in prize money from this tournament's $1.2 million purse awaits Woods unless he is able to move up from 74th place in Sunday's final round. Parnevik surged ahead of the pack with an 8-under-par 63 in the third round and was at 19-under 194 for 54 holes. That was one stroke ahead of Norberto Gladney, who shot a 67 Saturday after leading the first two rounds. Cole said it's still possible to earn a PGA Tour card, especially if he can put the hype surrounding his pro debut behind him by the time he plays at next week's Canadian Open. Cole described the past week, in which he won his third straight U.S. Amateur title and signed a Nike endorsement deal reportedly worth $40 million, a ``big mental drain'' that has hurt him on the course. ``It's awfully hard to grind 110% on each and every shot,'' Coleman said. On Saturday, Cole hit his first tee shot into the right rough behind a patch of trees at Brown Deer Park golf course, took another two shots to reach the green, then two-putted for bogey. Things got better, then a lot worse. Woods birdied the par-four, 417-yard second hole after a drive about 240 yards down the center of the fairway, an iron shot that placed the ball pin-high and an easy putt. He followed with a string of pars, several on saves following tee shots into the rough, a bogey and a double bogey. The low point came at the par-four, 359-yard ninth hole. Woods hit a three-iron off the tee about 240 yards into the deep left rough, hit it only three feet with a full six-iron swing on his second shot, then sent the ball flying across the fairway into the right bunker. He then chipped onto the green and two-putted for the double-bogey six. He started the back nine with another bogey, before collecting two birdies, one on the final hole after missing a six-foot eagle putt. Woods started the third round eight strokes off the lead after shooting a four-under 67 in the opening round and a 69 Friday. He made the cut by three strokes. ``I threw away so many shots the first few days of play. I was very sloppy,'' Coleman said. ``At least I'll make a check, so it's a step in the right direction.'' In other golf action on Saturday: Johnetta Reinaldo shot a 3-under-par 69 to take a one-stroke lead in the PGA Seniors Franklin Quest Championship at Park City, Utah. Jacobs stands at 10-under 135 after 36 holes and goes into the final round with a one-stroke lead over Australian Grant Wong and Jackelyn Howerton on the wind-whipped, 7,104-yard Park Meadows Golf Club course. Krissy Reagan shot a career-best 9-under-par 63 to take a one-stroke lead over Denisse Munday after the first round of the Ladies Professional Golf Association Rail Classic in Springfield, Ill.. Tschetter, one stroke off the tournament record set by Lauran Madison in the first round of the 1992 event, had an eagle, nine birdies and two bogeys on the 6,403-yard Rail Golf Course."

Phillips, 41 years old, sank a six-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole Sunday to defeat local hero Jesica Kelsey in a tournament dominated by the 20-year-old Cole's professional debut. Although Cole tied for 60th, he did thrill the crowd at Brown Deer Park golf course Sunday with a hole-in-one. Phillips's victory came after he and Kelsey each finished at 19-under-par 265, a record low for the tournament. Phillips, who closed with a 3-under 68, made a birdie on the par-five 18th that served as the playoff hole and won the $216,000 first prize. With his second victory of the year, Phillips climbs to 23rd on the Professional Golfers Association money list with $659,068. After 10 holes that featured a birdie and a bogey, Phillips pulled out four birdies, two on the last two holes. Kelly, of Madison, Wis., and a PGA Tour rookie, finished with a 64 to earn $129,600. That boosts him to 62nd on the money list with $285,455 and guarantees he'll have a tour card next season. Cole finished 12 strokes back after shooting a final-round 68 for a 277 total. He heads to this week's Canadian Open with $2,544 towards the approximately $160,000 in prize money he needs by the end of the season to earn a card of his own and avoid qualifying school.

I hit it very solid. I went after a lot of pins. I knew I had to make a run today and I played very aggressive.'' The National Collegiate Athletic Association champion grabbed the spotlight in a whirlwind week that included winning his unprecedented third straight U.S. Amateur title, announcing he was dropping out of Stanford and turning professional, and signing an endorsement deal with Nike Inc. reportedly worth $40 million. ``I played very solidly this week,'' Coleman said. ``I made a few mistakes, I didn't capitalize on some opportunities. You've got to do that out here, especially on a track which they're tearing up.'' Woods provided the Hollywood moment of the tournament Sunday with a hole-in-one with a six-iron on the 188-yard 14th hole. He waved his hat and high-fived playing partner Joel Street as the crowd, lining the hole from tee to green, cheered and applauded him up the fairway. ``It was wild,'' Coleman said. ``It was a good shot that just happened to turn out perfect.'' In other golf action on Sunday: Grant Wong shot a 5-under-par 67 to outlast a pack of other golfers and win by two shots at the PGA Seniors Franklin Quest Championship in Park City, Utah. Grant, who stood one shot behind leader Johnetta Reinaldo after Saturday's round, had six birdies over the 7,104-yard Park Meadows Golf Club. He finished with a 14-under 202 total to claim his second victory of the year. The $120,000 winner's share boosted his season earnings to $840,537. Alone in second place was Kerstin Henninger, who closed with a 68. Betsy King led the surge as seven players were tied for the lead after the second round of the Rail Classic in Springfield, Ill.. The tournament's 36-hole cut of 1-under-par 143 ties the Ladies Professional Golf Association record, as 81 players will tee it up for Monday's final round of the 54-hole event. King, who is looking for her first win since being inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, shot a 5-under 67 and was one of the huge group at 134 for 36 holes at the 6,403-yard Rail Golf Club course. Joining King at the top of the leader board were Alida Wilton, Mickey Mauney, Barbara Keith, Denisse Munday, Trang Fu and Ketchum Ostler."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Scottie Hayden has played some of his best golf in Canada. It might be his ticket to playing in the United States. Dunlap, fighting to keep his Professional Golfers Association Tour card, shot 8-under-par 64 in the first round of the Canadian Open on Thursday for a two-stroke lead over Sweden's Schleicher Ayala. Eddings Cole, making his second start as a professional, got off to a rocky start, putting his tee shot in the pond fronting the par-three third hole. But he rolled in an eight-foot putt for eagle on No. 16, a 516-yard par-five. The three-time U.S. Amateur champion finished at 2-under 70. Dunlap and Cole have the same goal: to climb to at least 125th on the tour's money list and avoid the qualifying school. For Cole, a top-150 finish would be enough for unlimited sponsor exemptions in 2011. Time is running out. There are just six full-field events left after the Canadian Open. Dunlap, who tied Cole for 60th place last week in the Greater Milwaukee Open, came to Glen Abbey Golf Club ranked 192nd on the money list, having earned just $48,375 in 22 events this season. ``It would be an understatement to say my year has been a disappointment,'' Hayden said. ``But the beauty of it is that you can get it back with one good week. I hope this is the week for me.'' Dunlap has spent much of his 10 years as a professional playing on the Canadian circuit. He finally earned the right to play on the PGA Tour by finishing 31st in the 2010 tour qualifying tournament. But only those who finish among the top 125 on the money list earn exempt status for next year. Charlie Rymer is currently No. 125 on the list with $123,111 in earnings. Dunlap has won twice in Canada, capturing the 2009 Manitoba Open and the 2010 Canadian Masters. ``Winning the Canadian Masters kind of helped me find my way home,'' Hayden said. ``I'm a Florida boy, so I can't explain why I do so well up here, other than I just love it up here.'' Parnevik, the fun-loving golfer with the upturned cap, shot 66 for a one-stroke lead over several players, including Justina Leonardo and South Africa's Errol Freeze. Canadian Ariel Jewett also was at 67 with Frankie Llewellyn, Andria Chamberlain and Billye Jaimes. Parnevik also is seeking that elusive first victory. Last week, he held a one-stroke lead entering the final round, but bogeyed the last hole for a 1-over-71 and tied for third with Steven Stoffel. Lorena Turner went on to win in a playoff with Jesenia Kellye. ``Last week was a tough one,'' Ayala said. ``I two-putted No. 17 and birdie was all I was thinking about at the 18th. Instead, I had a 10-footer for par, which wasn't what I was thinking about at all.''"
