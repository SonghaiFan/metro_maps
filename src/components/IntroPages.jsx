        <strong>What does the research involve?</strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        This study aims to investigate narrative visualisations about text data.
        In particular, this research explores and analyses text data, and
        produces visualisations to communicate the narratives from the data.
        This research will assess how well these visualisations reveal the
        narratives, and users's understanding of the visualisations and their
        interpretation of the narratives from the visualisations.
      </div>
      <div>
        If you choose to participate in this research, you will be asked to
        complete a user study by using a computer. This user study will be
        conducted online.

        Should you wish to participate in the study, your consent will be
        required to proceed. Your consent is voluntary and can be given by
        signing and dating a Consent Form before the beginning of the study. You
        may choose not to participate in this study without any implication. If
        you do proceed, you may also choose to withdraw at any stage during the
        study without any implication.

      <div>
        The Consent Form and this Explanatory Statement has been presented to
        you for your review before the study. Once you have read the documents,
        you will be asked to sign and date the Consent Form before proceeding.

        Once you have completed the study, the final step of your participation
        is completing a questionnaire with demographic questions. This
        questionnaire does not require any identifiable information and is
        submitted anonymously. Therefore, if you request to withdraw after this
        step, all information will be deleted except the questionnaire.

        News articles represent the fundamental unit of the discourse of
        opportunity and disadvantage in Australia. The articles collected are
        from new publications. Each article is titled, authored and dated.
        Tracking the content of news articles allows us{" "}

          to map out how various topics are being discussed.
        </span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Looking at the bigger picture, we can see how frequently certain topics
        are featured in the news. News articles on similar topics that are
        published around the same time are grouped together in our visualisation
        as{" "}
        <span className="text-yellow-400">a set of overlapping rectangles</span>
        , which we call a <span className="text-yellow-400">'station'</span>.
        The number of articles in a station is indicated by the size of the
        stack of rectangles and by the number encircled beneath the station.
        Each station is labelled by its most representative news headline and by
        its most prominent keyword.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>A single article can highlight various disadvantage issues, and

        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Depending on the frequency of the shared keywords or the number of

        connection lines are therefore drawn to indicate how a topic has been

        Each entire line can be seen as a specific topic or event, and its
