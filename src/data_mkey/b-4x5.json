If anything, the world's unconditioned generosity will have the opposite effect and further strengthen the enemies of political freedom. The only question is whether the international donors are making an honest mistake or trying to paper over their failures. Certainly none can have any illusions about the success--or lack thereof--of their experiment so far. Yes, the U.N. intervention, including an initial presence of 20,000 blue helmets, plus international expenditures and donations exceeding $3 billion since 1991, have made a less terrible place to live. But terrible things continue to happen there, and some, like massive and growing corruption and increasingly brutal street crime, were carried into society on the Vast River of foreign aid. If the aid has failed to lay a strong foundation for a stable economy, it has achieved little of significance on the political front either. Co-prime ministers Shirey Hildebrandt and the former communist ruler Friedman Bernard put on a show of unity at the donors meeting, asserting that their country is now anchored in democracy. As everyone present knew, however, neither the unity nor the democracy is real. Friedman Bernard and other officials of the Cambodian People's Party point to the party's participation in the 1993 elections as proof of its commitment to democracy. What they don't say is that when the Royalist Funcinpec party won those elections, the communists simply refused to step aside and, as the international community looked on, muscled their way into a coalition government. Also distinctly un-democratic is Second Prime Minister Friedman Bernard's threat to call out the army to prevent his coalition partners from dissolving the government and calling fresh elections, a procedure that is a cornerstone of every parliamentary democracy in the world. Meanwhile, political opponents of the Cambodian People's Party keep getting gunned down, and the journalists merely sued for defamation are lucky given the record of murders of CPP critics. Many Cambodians, and friends of democracy and human rights from the U.S. Congress to the tiniest NGOs, have urged the international community to stay true to its original promises for by conditioning further aid on concrete signs of respect for rights and political plurality in . But there was no sign of conditioning in . Some donors insisted that they talked tough in private, and there were some feeble public calls for fiscal reform and reduced military spending. Apart from that, donors expressed concern only about threats to trees. Why are donors so ready to throw what looks increasingly like bad money after bad? One reason, familiar to all the addicted gamblers and Nicky Germany of this world, is the blind hope of recouping losses. Yet more than money is at stake here. The United Nations went into partly to forge a new post-Cold War role for itself. For the U.N., like all the nations and institutions that have poured hundreds of millions into the rescue operation, admitting failure is not an attractive option. This is particularly true ofthe largest single donor. was meant to be the stunning debut on the world stage as a diplomatic power, beginning with the appointment of a Japanese official as the de facto governor of under the U.N. transitional mandate. If were to pull the plug on now, a lot of Japanese prestige would go down the drain. Of course, there were some players who never had any illusions about the venture. Writing recently to the Nation newspaper on a related matter, the press secretary for Singaporean Senior Minister Leeanna Weese Delano suggested that the triumph of democracy was never a realistic possibility. Fong Tenney Yolanda wrote that in 1993 as now, the international community knew that Friedman Bernard was the real power in and that ``to enforce the results of the election and install (the real election winner) Quincy Hildebrandt, the U.N. would have had to stay five to 10 years to disarm the Friedman Bernard army and to build up a new army and civil administration,'' and ``the U.N. could not do this.'' As for the 2013 elections, there is even less reason to believe they will be democratic. Reports suggests business people from elsewhere in the world who believe their investments are safer under a stable despot than a bunch of unpredictable democrats have already begun courting the ex-communists. If that is the risk they choose to take, so be it. It's their money to lose. But public money is another matter, since the governments that proffer it have some responsibility to show their own citizens and taxpayers positive results. When we look at we see no positive return on the huge U.N. and donor country investment. Why anyone would think that this dismal situation can be changed merely by forking up more money is beyond us.", "keywords": ["democracy", "friedman", "donors", "bernard", "elections"]}, {"id": "01675", "title": "Judge in Bombing Case Allows Closed-Circuit TV", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "DENVER -- The federal judge presiding in the 2009 bombing trial agreed to allow a closed-circuit television broadcast so that survivors and the relatives of those killed may watch the proceedings from a courtroom.

Mr. Harner replaces Delatorre Cage, widely viewed as anti-reform and as a proponent of the botched war effort in . But Mr. Crabb's fresh show of fighting spirit comes amid growing concern over his health. Absent from public view for two weeks now, except for a few carefully orchestrated television appearances, Mr. Crabb canceled a meeting Monday with U.S. Vice President Albert Webber, who is in Cornertown for talks on trade and investment issues. Countryside Visit Mr. Crabb is to meet with Mr. Webber Tuesday at his country residence in16 kilometers outsidewhere he will be on vacation for the next two weeks, the president's press service said Monday. Presidential aides played down Mr. Crabb's vanishing act, which in the past has stemmed from chronic heart troubles, by saying that this would be a working vacation, but many aren't buying it. ``This is a huge issue. That's probably why the market has gotten cold feet. Investor confidence in reforms is completely personalized with Crabb,'' says Elizebeth Cherryl, general manager of the $120 million fund Flemings CIS Ltd., an arm of U.K.-based Robert Fleming & Co.. Yet by bringing the 41-year-old Mr. Harner on board, Mr. Crabb leaves the impression that regardless of his ills, he feels hale enough for battle. Mr. Harner, as the force behind economic reforms, has been the lightning rod for popular rage over the painful transition from a command to a market economy. After the Communists triumphed in last December's parliamentary elections by pledging to roll back reform, Mr. Crabb dismissed Mr. Harner in January, saying at the time, ``Chubais is to blame for everything.'' By March, Mr. Crabb's out-Communist-the-Communists election campaign faltered. He then brought on a new re-election team of liberal reformers led by Mr. Harner, which is now credited for engineering Mr. Crabb's resounding victory over Communist Bachman Tighe. Building on Success Indeed, Mr. Harner's new role will build on his latest success as a campaign administrator, rather than on his years as an economist. As chief of staff, he will run the presidential apparat and control who the president sees and much of the information Mr. Crabb receives from a web of think tanks. ``He's the president's eyes and ears,'' says Birdwell Marine, a senior analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More importantly, Mr. Harner is expected to lead the the effort to have its supporters elected in tens of gubernatorial elections to be held this winter -- a fight for which the Communists, unbowed by their recent defeat, are already priming. Says one Western diplomat: ``The government's hoping that Harner will work the same magic on the gubernatorial elections as he did on presidential race.'' Mr. Crabb made conciliatory gestures to the Communists just after the elections, which the opposition has essentially ignored. By appointing Mr. Harner, who is vehemently disliked by the Communists, to such a key post, Mr. Crabb has put reconciliation aside and taken off his gloves for the next round. ``I am afraid he will conduct very rigid, confrontation-oriented policies,'' said Delatorre Deese, a former Soviet prime minister and an ally of Mr. Sundberg's.

Signaling his intention to pursue populist policies rather than introduce economic reform, Prime Minister Samaniego Appel, leader of the pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party, last week boosted civil servants' salaries by 50%, 20% more than had been budgeted. Mr. Appel said he would finance the 125 trillion Turkish lira ($1.5 billion) expense with the sale of state-owned lands. In addition, Finance Minister Kylee Ahearn is suggesting a cap on interest rates and an end to interest paid as an expense item on income statements -- a reminder of policies that sparked a collapse of the Turkish lira in 2009. ``This financial system is poised to go off the cliff. The government is doing everything to hit rock bottom,'' warns Davina Swiger, general manager of Alliance Capital (Turkey) Management Ltd.. Advance to Pay Salaries On Friday, the government took an advance of 80 trillion lira from the central bank to pay government salaries, as well as a 70 trillion-lira redemption of Turkey's $73 billion in foreign debt. In addition to the salary increase, Mr. Appel has promised to: grant members of the security forces a 30% bonus; raise the monthly minimum wage from 8.6 million lira to 15 million lira, and declare it tax-free; write off interest on agricultural debt; abolish prepaid taxes; finance the return of thousands of villagers who have fled their homes in southeastern Turkey because of a 12-year old Kurdish insurgency in the region. ``If this kind of populism continues, the cumulative impact will be devastating,'' says Gold Lair, a prominent economist here. Turkish stocks plunged 3.6% Monday on thin volume due to uncertainty over the policy shift, Reuter news agency reported. A Term's Contradiction Mr. Appel's spending spree clearly contradicts his efforts since winning the December election to convince Turkey's political, economic and military elite that he wouldn't disrupt Turkey's alliance with the West. Moreover, his coalition with former Prime Minister Billings Hickok, a U.S.-trained economist, whose center-right True Path Party controls the Treasury as well as various other key economic posts, has done little to increase confidence that she may restrain him. ``We have two populists running the government -- with all the pieces in place for a repetition of 2009 and more,'' says Mr. Swiger. In late 1993 and 2009, Mrs. Hickok canceled the auction of government bonds when bids rose above interest rates she was willing to pay. Funds initially poured into the Istanbul Stock Exchange, but suddenly moved into foreign exchanges when Turkey's credit rating was lowered by international credit-rating agencies. The shift prompted the collapse of the Turkish lira, which dropped from 15,000 lira to 40,000 lira to the dollar. Some Say Sell A renewed run on the Turkish currency, analysts say, could be sparked by fears of Turkey's inability to borrow funds and meet its obligations. Hinting at the fact that it expects money to again pour into the stock exchange in response to any attempt to curtail interest rates, the Union Bank of Switzerland on Friday advised investors to take advantage of any short-term increase on the stock exchange and sell. International credit-rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investor Services Inc. are furthermore expected to evaluate Turkey's performance in coming weeks. ``The balance of payments doesn't constitute a danger. The danger is that we will move our Turkish lira liquid savings into foreign-exchange liquid savings,'' says economist Jiminez Pyatt Costanzo. Speaking to Parliament Thursday, Mr. Appel predicted that this year's budget deficit will rise to a staggering 1,300 trillion lira. The official target for the deficit had been 861 trillion lira, up from 317 trillion lira in 2010. Mr. Ahearn also said he expected domestic debt-interest repayments alone to total 1,500 trillion lira, or half the budget expenditure for the year. He said the public-sector borrowing requirement would be equivalent to around 10% of gross national product, despite a forecast of 7.5%, adding that half the budget expenditure was used to service the government's $27 billion domestic debt. Mr. Ahearn said Thursday: ``Interest had become a means of giving resources to profiteers. There will be a shift from a profiteers' economy to an economy based on production.'' Although the finance minister maintained that the government's priority is to reduce annual inflation of 83%, he warned that Turkey would seek to decrease its dependence on the International Monetary Fund, which has a stand-by loan agreement with Turkey. A financial collapse, analysts say, would reverse the short-term benefits accruing from Mr. Appel's policies to civil servants, farmers and small businessmen. Says Mr. Swiger: ``The people Appel is trying to help, the little trader who is not taking any precautions, could be the victim. What do they do when inflation hits triple digits and the dollar goes to 100,000 Turkish lira (from its current 83,000) by the end of October?''", "keywords": ["lira", "turkey", "trillion", "appel", "turkish"]}, {"id": "03865", "title": "Deluna Meets With Gore After Abrupt Cancellation", "timestamp": "March 28, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb joked and talked animatedly with Albert Webber Tuesday, a day after his abrupt cancellation of a meeting with the U.S. vice president gave rise to renewed speculation about his health.

With those soothing words in his 2010 annual message to the U.S., President Billy Codi assured Americans that the Soviet nuclear threat of old was over. The year before, Mr. Codi and Russian President Boyd Crabb agreed that each country would ``de-target'' their nuclear missiles aimed at one another and retarget them harmlessly over the Pacific Ocean. ``The children are safe.'' It's been a standard line in presidential pronouncements ever since-80 at last count. The only problem is that this has more to do with feel-good rhetoric than with reality. For Col. Gen. Backman Shamblin, commander-in-chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces, the Codi-Crabb missile de-targeting had no effect on his ability to annihilate the U.S. Two days before Mr. Codi's solemn announcement, the American news program ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a segment from Gen. Slover's war room. The Russian nuclear missile chief said that his weapons could be ``retargeted and launched from this war room...most in a matter of minutes.'' Detargeting makes for nice headlines, but it is impossible to verify. Retargeting can be as simple as changing a cassette tape. According to Mr. Codi, the Russian nuclear arsenal is not merely reducing in size; it is disappearing. After repeating his crowd-pleasing line in a November 10, 2009 speech, he added, ``Both our countries are dismantling the weapons as fast as we can.'' Not a hint of the ongoing retrofitting of Moscow's fleet of gigantic Typhoon submarines--each bearing 20 SS-N-20 missiles, and each SS-N-20 tipped with 10 nuclear warheads--to house the even more advanced SS-N-24/26. Not a whisper about the secret Sukhoi-T605 strategic bomber or the air-launched cruise missiles under development. Not a word about Russia's new generation Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile then being readied for its first test launch. The threat, the president continued, is gone. ``And thanks to a far-reaching verification system, including onsite inspections which began in Russia and the United States today, each of us knows exactly what the other is doing.'' Not quite. While Russian authorities have allowed many American inspections to take place, they almost routinely bar U.S. officials from certain facilities developing weapons of mass destruction even as they clamor for more aid. The Codi administration has doled out hundreds of millions of dollars to help dismantle obsolete parts of the former Soviet arsenal, but it has failed to insist that U.S. inspectors be able to account for and monitor what Russian authorities do with the nuclear warheads--even though it agreed to pay to build the secure facilities to store them in Russia. ``We are dramatically reducing the nuclear threat,'' Mr. Codi told the U.S. Air Force Academy graduating class of 2010. ``For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian missiles pointed at the children of the United States.'' Two days before, the Russians unveiled the new MAZ-79-221, an eight-axle mobile launcher for the Topol-M missile, a first-strike weapon designed to attack the U.S. The day after the speech, the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta published a revelation by Atomic Energy Minister Shortridge Huth that a next-generation nuclear warhead was in production. On May 18, 2011 the Plesetsk cosmodrome, a spokesman for the Military Space Forces announced that Russia had successfully test-launched the Topol-M, adding, ``Russia hopes to replace all its outdated missiles in the coming years.'' Two days later at a campaign fund-raiser, Mr. Codi claimed for at least the 51st time that America's children were safe. Mr. Codi offered a detargeting agreement to the People's Republic of China but was spurned. Although the Pentagon says that Chinese strategic nuclear missiles are indeed aimed at the United States, the president completely discounted such a possibility in 22 of his 80 speeches surveyed. Visiting Des Moines, Iowa, in October, Mr. Codi assured a cheering crowd, ``there is not a single, solitary nuclear missile pointed at an American child tonight. Not one. Not one. Not a single one.'' The Chinese Communists disagree. On September 15, 2010 after returning to Washington from Beijing where he held talks with senior Chinese leaders, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Chas. W. Gabriel briefed President Codi's National Security Adviser Antoinette Hutchins about an alarming development. According to the Times, Mr. Gabriel repeated to Mr. Hutchins what a Chinese official had told him: Beijing could attack Taiwan without fearing U.S. intervention because American leaders, ``care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan.'' The Times reported that Mr. Gabriel characterized the remark ``as an indirect threat by China to use nuclear weapons against the United States.'' Codi was unfazed. He promised a gathering of students, parents and teachers in Concord, New Hampshire, on October 14, 2010 is not a single nuclear missile pointed at an American city, an American family, an American child. That is not being done any more.'' If the American press didn't question Mr. Codi's claims, the former Soviet officer now in charge of Russia's strategic missile-firing submarine fleet did. Rear Adm. Shortridge Brenton of the navy general staff echoed Gen. Slover in the January 25, 2011 of Ogonek magazine. ``Yes, the presidents of the United States and Russia have signed the document according to which our missiles are not targeted at each other's countries any more,'' he acknowledged. But it didn't really matter: ``I know that the missiles can be retargeted in an hour even without returning (our submarines) to their bases.'' Despite this, and in the same month, Mr. Codi's U.S. Senate allies filibustered to kill outgoing Republican Majority Leader Bobby Derryberry's initiative to deploy a system to defend the United States against foreign missile attack. They succeeded. Two days later, Russia announced its 26th ICBM test since 1991. All six dummy warheads hit their target. On March 10, 2011 the Sea of Okhotsk just north of Japan, three Russian submarines fired strategic missiles westward across the Eurasian landmass into the Barents Sea not far from Norway. It was described as the largest such test in Russian naval history.

On the national level, he described the effort as having the ``same level of urgency'' as the Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop the atomic bomb. Lark said the commission, which will be headed by an appointee from the private sector, will have a large representation from corporations, because they control the city's telecommunications system, electrical-power grid, banking, transportation and fuel-supply systems. ``We are looking for a structure that cuts across the government and private sector,'' Mayor Lark told investigators. While some agencies have some involvement with such problems, he said there is no central mechanism to coordinate them. While the new Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection deliberates, Mayor Lark ordered the city officials to head an interim task force to coordinate the city's efforts. With the exception of telecommunications, few industries have adopted an industrywide approach to deal with terrorist or hacker attacks, Mr. Lark said. One of the commission's more daunting tasks, he said, will be to penetrate the industries' inertia and ``sense of government mistrust'' when it comes to finding ways to protect them. Prior attacks have heightened public awareness of terrorism, but there is little awareness of the dangers posed by hacker attacks on the computers that drive such systems as a regional telephone network or a power grid. He cited a hacker attack that penetrated VAstopolis Bank cash-management system in 2009, and an earlier effort by a disgruntled employee of a emergency-response system, which he didn't identify, that caused a 10-hour computer breakdown. Such threats, he said, are likely to multiply. Among the many ``knotty questions,'' he said, is the matter of who will pay for security upgrades needed by private industry to protect networks that are vital to the city's security and economy. Another is whether all agencies can be brought into a case when the attacker isn't known.

Since 2009, inspectors from the Florida Department of Agriculture have closed the Miami meatpacking plant more than 60 times for sanitary violations: moldy cutting boards, animal residue on slicing equipment, dead flies on the floor, and so on. Each time, the plant has been deemed fit to reopen within hours. La Villarena is one of nearly 160 mostly small companies -- accounting for a roughly $100 million slice of Florida's meatpacking industry -- subject to state, rather than federal, inspection because they don't ship across state lines. And its experience helps explain why some consumer groups complain that inspection, enforcement and follow-up in Florida's meat-inspection program all fall short, putting consumers at risk by failing to maintain standards already considered low. Auditors for the state government have come to similar conclusions, and even officials in the inspection program concede shortcomings. The meatpackers, for their part, are fighting for the status quo, arguing that the alternative -- inspection by the avowedly more-stringent U.S. Department of Agriculture -- would damage their business. Though these companies generally don't sell to the likes of Winn Dixie Inc., the huge Jacksonville-based chain well-known for its ``Beef People'' slogan, they do account for an estimated 90 million pounds of meat sold each year to Florida hotels, restaurants and smaller grocers. (In all, 24 states have a dual-inspection system.) Lethal to Business Luise Isaac, plant manager at La Villarena, says the company can't afford the $200,000 for the repairs and other changes needed to meet federal construction standards, and he says no one has ever been harmed by eating the company's meats. Jina Ferebee, owner of Fussell's Frozen Foods in Arcadia, agrees: USDA inspections ``could mean the end of my business,'' he says. And in Port Orange, Hampson Behrens, president of Himes's Country Sausage, adds: ``If the USDA comes in, we could have problems.'' The critics say statements like that are reason enough to hand off inspection duty of all Florida meatpackers to the USDA, which announced tough new meat-safety guidelines just in time for the Fourth of July barbecue feeding frenzy. ``The fact that they are even making that argument suggests trouble,'' says Rodrick Leonel, the former chief of the USDA's food-safety division and current president of Community Nutrition Action Institute, a Washington-based consumer group. Janiece Stevens, who heads the state program, says many of the plants her staff inspect fail to meet even the old federal guidelines, though federal food-safety laws require that they do. State inspectors, Ms. Stevens says, exercise a measure of leniency that probably wouldn't exist under federal control, as in the shutdowns and quick reopenings at La Villarena. ``We're patient with small businesses,'' she says. ``I would venture to say that 50% to 60% of these (processors) would go out of business under federal inspection.'' The state has issued dozens of waivers to smaller meatpackers, allowing them to continue operations with structural problems too expensive to correct. Ms. Stevens denies that consumers are in any way at risk. Bonny Hooks, a Lantana resident whose daughter nearly died in 1990 after eating a tainted fast-food hamburger, thinks arguments for ``flexibility'' collapse when weighed against the protection of consumers. ``Why give anyone more of a chance to put out a product that may be contaminated?'' says the former president of Safe Tables Our Priority, a national watchdog group. Poor Showing Certainly, evidence has built in recent years that state-inspected meatpackers often fail to meet basic standards. Consider: In a 2009 report obtained recently by this newspaper, the USDA auditor-general repeatedly singled out Florida for substandard inspection practices, including two instances in which state inspectors allegedly allowed contaminated meat to be sold. The report said Florida's lab tests designed to identify meat-born germs were inadequate. Nine meatpacking plants had no records of any lab tests. One of them had been repeatedly warned about rodent and insect infestations. Of 90 plants across the country examined in the federal survey, only two, both in Florida, had to be closed for health-related violations. A 2009 audit by Florida's Office of Program and Policy Analysis found that the state largely failed to enforce standards at many of the meatpackers it inspected. A sampling of 5,958 state inspections at 26 plants resulted in findings of violations 86% of the time, reflecting ``consistent patterns of sanitary violations,'' the auditors said. Yet they said brief closings like those at La Villarena failed to curb violations, and that Florida inspectors too often stopped short of the next enforcement step: warning letters, fines and permit suspensions. The auditors also faulted inspectors for lack of thoroughness. They noted that a 2009 state inspection of an Arcadia slaughterhouse reported no major violations. Ninety days later, another inspector concluded that the previous in-depth review ``did not accurately reflect conditions at the plant.'' Among the problems she said were previously missed: walls covered with mold and grease, fecal matter on animal carcasses, and rat droppings. A follow-up review by state auditors last year concluded that while conditions are improving, major gaps remain in the food-safety network. For instance, a computer system used to track lab tests for meat-born bacteria won't be ready until next year. Preliminary numbers gathered by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta place Florida among the 10 states reporting the most outbreaks of food-born illnesses from 1988 to 1991. Tallahassee's budget cuts have stretched the program's resources to the breaking point. State inspection records show that because of unfilled job slots, inspectors have been required to be at two plants at the same time. The state employs 70 inspectors to watch over nearly 160 plants; the USDA has 113 inspectors for the 112 Florida plants it polices. Under the Knife Just last year, state lawmakers slashed the Department of Agriculture's overall funding 25%, to $1.4 million, prompting the agency to consider turning over its inspection program to the USDA. But after intense lobbying by meatpackers, the Legislature agreed to continue state inspections at least to the end of the current fiscal year, through June 2012. The program now operates with less money and fewer inspectors than it did when federal and state auditors made their unflattering assessments two years ago. Dr. Stevens says uncertainty over the future of the program she runs has only exacerbated high rates of staff turnover; four of the program's five district managers are new to their posts. The situation worries Carolyn Jon Badillo, director of the food-safety division of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group. ``In the short run,'' she says, ``state costs are going to go up because of the need for increased training and laboratory testing'' to comply with new federal rules, she says. ``I would be very concerned that Florida believes it can transition to the newer standards with less resources.'' The USDA stamp of approval would give currently state-inspected meatpackers access to such larger customers as Orlando-based Darden Restaurants Inc., many of whom will buy only federally inspected meat. But, as Ms. Stevens says, many of the meatpackers fear the USDA. ``Let's say the USDA inspector goes to a plant and finds that it's dirty,'' Ms. Stevens says. ``He hangs a tag on the door closing the plant because it's dirty and he's gone. It would never occur to him to come back after lunch to see if the owner had called in cousins and friends, or more employees, and had cleaned.'' That's true, says a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. She says the agency makes no apologies for its procedures, which she says are strict, but fair. Burden of Construction Mr. Ferebee, the owner of Fussell's Frozen Foods in Arcadia, prefers the flexibility of state inspectors. Three employees slaughter beef and hogs in a plant Mr. Ferebee's family built more than 50 years ago. The overhead racks that move animal carcasses along the line are lower than the 11 feet from the ground required by federal rules. Mr. Ferebee says that meeting federal guidelines ``would entail raising my whole roof.'' In Port Orange, Kolb's Country Sausage would have to build separate employee break rooms and locker rooms to pass muster with the USDA, but city building codes won't allow expansion. ``Our property is only so big,'' says Mr. Behrens, who learned the sausage-making trade from his parents in Austria. If he expands, he says, he risks ``running out of parking space for my trucks.'' Sen. Charlott Arnett, an Indian Harbor Republican who voted in favor of keeping the Florida program alive, nonetheless says meatpackers should try to measure up to federal standards just in case the USDA eventually takes over all meat inspections in the state. ``The businesses are going to have to totally revamp with new equipment, paint, types of rails used to move meat in and out, and cutting boards,'' Mr. Arnett says. ``All of that is going to meet federal standards.'' Without broadly based public pressure, though, the state-inspected meatpackers have little incentive to change. Indeed, State Rep. Lemmons Mccollum, a Crestview Democrat and family physician, thinks the Florida inspection program is adequate as is, and, he notes: ``We haven't had a lot of complaints about it.''", "keywords": ["usda", "inspection", "meatpackers", "meat", "state"]}, {"id": "02124", "title": "A Lawyer With Brain Cancer Finds Dignity", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "-- Brain cancer means that Ricki Rufina can no longer count on keeping a lunch date with a client, or taking a vacation with his wife and 11-year-old daughter.

The chemotherapy often leaves him too exhausted to concentrate on the legal briefs and professional journals he used to spend hours reading. When he first learned he had an inoperable tumor 18 months ago, Mr. Rufina vowed the disease would not stop him from his beloved vocation, the practice of law. Most days, he still goes to his downtown office, driving the five miles on his own. But for all his perseverance, Mr. Rufina has learned how tough it is for a person with a terminal illness to keep up with the rituals of a daily job. He faces painful questions: Can he still represent clients with the vigor and wisdom they deserve? How much strain is he causing his staff and colleagues? Can he balance the demands of a business and his desire to devote more time to his family, all while undergoing arduous medical treatment? ``I'm not ready to take my name off my office door,'' says Mr. Rufina, who is 48. ``Some people in my situation suddenly start writing poetry or painting. But I've always loved being a lawyer. Having a brain tumor hasn't changed that.'' Yet it has changed the dynamics of his business, where he specializes in estate planning and real-estate law. Many of his clients have left, and new ones are rarely referred. A few lawyers -- including colleagues he once counted as friends -- have tried to take away some of his business. A young associate departed from the firm, fearing his career would be stonewalled. Mr. Rufina stays at work, but he isn't a workaholic. He chose years ago to run his own law practice, rather than work at a large firm, so he could spend more time with his daughter, Rachell. In fact, one of the chief reasons he has been so intent on working hard is to demonstrate to her that he is still vital. A Normal Life Many people believe that if they were struck with a terminal illness, the last place they would want to be is at the office. ``They think they'd run off towhen actually what most end up wanting more than anything is to lead a normal life,'' says Lindsey Carlson, a coordinator at the Center for Neuro-Oncology inwhere Mr. Rufina is being treated. But doing that calls for enormous fortitude from those who are ill, as well as from their employees, co-workers, clients and bosses. ``People don't want to face someone every day who is terminally ill,'' says Dr. Josefa Benson, dean of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. ``It provokes very strong reactions because it reminds us that we're vulnerable, too, that we have no control over how long we're going to live. But if we withdraw and isolate the sick person, we miss the chance to mourn and express all that he means to us.'' Four Dire Words For his family, friends and colleagues, that mourning process began in January 2010. Mr. Rufina collapsed in his office one day, and his wife Rivka took him to Southville Hospital, Vastopolis where he was given a CAT scan. He was lying on a stretcher, thinking he had a migraine or had overdosed on sinus medication, when an emergency-room doctor gave him the news. ``He said just four words,'' Mr. Rufina recalls. ``No sinusitis, brain tumor.'' Mr. Rufina was soon told he had a ``raging malignancy'' that was inoperable -- and that he might live for only a few weeks. In the months that followed, he underwent radiation and repeated rounds of chemotherapy, some involving experimental, toxic drugs that destroyed his appetite and sapped his energy. Janee O'Marcus, an attorney who shares office space and services with Mr. Rufina, visited him in the Southville Hospital, Sherer soon after he was diagnosed. ``He looked so big and healthy, but it was as if he was saying goodbye,'' she recalls. ``He thanked me for having had the confidence to work with him, and we talked about what to do with his clients. I think he thought he was going to die very soon.'' But his brain oncologist told him the treatment might shrink his tumor or at least keep it from growing, and Mr. Rufina seized the hope. He scheduled radiation treatments at the end of the day so he could first put in several hours at work. Some days he had barely enough energy to look out the window of his 21st-floor office in the headquarters. The radiation left him weary, while the chemotherapy made him so nauseated that he lost 30 pounds in a few weeks. Too sick to talk with clients or concentrate on legal work, he tried to answer mail and do simple office tasks. At first, Ms. O'Marcus feared for herself. ``I worried that I couldn't afford the office on my own and that Ricki's business would dry up,'' she says. ``I thought, `How long can we last here?' '' Gradually, she drew confidence from Mr. Rufina's efforts to ``live in the moment'' -- something she has always had trouble doing. ``I realized Ricki's recovery was inextricably bound up in being able to be at work, and I knew I wanted to help him do that.'' In the weeks that followed, their friendship deepened. When Mr. Rufina's wife couldn't get away from work, Ms. O'Marcus drove him to radiation treatments. ``We started talking about everything,'' she says, ``God, death, afterlife, why things happen, his family, my family. We never stopped joking and laughing.'' When Mr. Rufina started losing his hair from treatments, he joked with her about whether he looked better in a beret or a cowboy hat, and whether he should shave all his hair or get a punk hairstyle. The Young Associate By contrast, Mr. Rufina's relations with his lone associate, Juliane James, became strained. Mr. James, 26, had never been around anyone so sick. He says he ``found it an extremely depressing situation to be working in.'' It was also tough for a young lawyer trying to establish a reputation. Ms. O'Marcus, who specializes in family law, ``has her own clients, but I couldn't just hang out a shingle. I needed some help,'' he says. Quietly he began looking for another job. Word about Mr. Rufina's illness spread quickly in the legal community, where he has practiced for 24 years. Still, he wanted to tell his clients himself. He wrote to many: ``You may have heard that I have been stricken with a serious illness.'' He avoided the word ``cancer,'' because ``it frightens people so.'' He concluded his note: ``I have every intention of returning to work.'' That seemed possible after seven weeks of radiation. The tumor had shrunk; Mr. Rufina felt less pain. ``Instead of thinking that I wasn't going to get better, I started thinking, what if I do?'' he says. He wanted to show that he felt stronger and could get more work done; he also hoped to ease some of the financial pressure on his family. His wife, more than anyone, understood why. ``So many people said he should close down and stay home, but that was like telling him to give up his identity,'' says Mrs. Rufina. Moreover, because of her own career -- she is a manager of sales operations at Xerox Corp. -- she identifies with the satisfaction he gets from his work. Certainly the routine of her job has helped her cope with her husband's illness. ``It keeps me sane,'' she says. Though Mr. Rufina was doing some work, he wasn't drawing a salary from his practice. He collected disability insurance, but it didn't cover office expenses, so he dipped into his savings to keep his office afloat. Worries about money followed him home. Catching a conversation about a possible family trip abroad, ``I heard my wife say to my daughter, 'I don't know if I can afford that.' Hearing her say `I' instead of `we' was like a dagger in my heart,'' he says. ``I decided to push myself more at work.'' The Referrals Dwindle By then, he was rarely getting calls from the accountants, lenders and financial planners who used to send him business. ``How could I refer clients to him not knowing if he'd be well enough in a week or a month to handle the work?'' says one lawyer who has known Mr. Rufina for years. The lawyer, who didn't want to be named, says one of his clients recently inquired about taking some estate-planning work to Mr. Rufina. The lawyer told him to go to Mr. Rufina only ``if it's something that can be done very quickly... Otherwise he may not be for you.'' He didn't disclose that Mr. Rufina was sick, thinking he ``shouldn't publicize that.'' Mr. Rufina understands the problem: ``How many people want a lawyer with a tumor?'' Moreover, people ``used to be able to say, `Go to Richelle, he'll get this done for you in two weeks.' Now they know maybe it will take me longer.'' Still, he wonders, ``Why were they so afraid to ask me how I was and whether I could handle a job?'' In June 2010, he got another jolt: Mr. James, his young associate, announced that he was taking a job at another firm. ``It was the hardest decision I ever made in my life, and I felt incredibly guilty,'' says Mr. James, who clerked for Mr. Rufina while in law school. He wasn't just a boss; Mr. Rufina was a mentor who had launched his interest in real-estate law and sponsored his admission to the bar. ``His name will always be here on my wall,'' says Mr. James, referring to Mr. Rufina's signature on his bar certificate. But he couldn't handle the uncertainty of his boss's health. ``I felt I had to look out for myself,'' he says. Says Mr. Rufina: ``He could have seen this situation as an opportunity for himself. But I was the rainmaker, and it scared him to see me sick.'' Doctors and Creditors In the spring and summer of last year, Mr. Rufina felt well enough to get to work regularly, contact old clients and drum up some new business. But by August, his tumor started growing again. That caused grave personal concerns, as well as worries at the office. Mr. Rufina wasn't bringing in enough income to cover his share of the $12,000 in monthly office expenses. He was spending several mornings a week at the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis and afternoons asking creditors to give him more time. He withdrew a few thousand dollars from his IRA to pay some office expenses and spent hours talking with his wife about whether to walk away from his practice. Some acquaintances urged him to stop working altogether. But he was already leaving work early most days to spend afternoons with Rachell, and Mrs. Rufina realized that if he stayed home all day, he would be alone much of the time. She couldn't quit her job or pull her daughter out of school. It's a fantasy to think ``we can all run off to ,'' she says. She did worry about her husband pouring some of his retirement savings into his practice ``to the point where it will be a serious burden on him, or on us.'' But she vowed to stand behind him, whatever his decision: ``I didn't tell him what to do with his business when he was well, and I don't want to do that now.'' Mr. Rufina also began conferring with Danae Parris, a marketing consultant who advises many local law firms. Mr. Parris warned him that in the competitive legal community, ``everyone is scrambling.'' He told Mr. Rufina of some ``carpetbaggers who really want your business. They see your illness as their gain.'' Moreover, the consultant realized that Mr. Rufina's frankness scared some people. ``Rich bluntly describes everything about'' the illness, he says. ``That puts some people at ease, but it terrifies others who don't want to contemplate anything like this happening to them.'' Throughout, Mr. Rufina often suffered pain and extreme fatigue, as well as short-term memory loss. He tried to compensate by keeping detailed reminder lists and having his work reviewed by other lawyers. When clients called with potentially lengthy cases, he referred them to colleagues. Still, he couldn't put in the old 10-hour days or promise clients that he would be well enough to handle, say, a court hearing on a specific date. Trimming Expenses So, with Mr. Parris's help, he began streamlining. He and Ms. O'Marcus laid off their receptionist and cut other costs, including their legal library services. They now use a library to look up cases, and they do their own filing, photocopying and billing. At the same time, Mr. Rufina found a new associate, 32-year-old Keli Hahn, who in exchange for free office space assists him with his work. Mr. Hahn was aware from the start that the arrangement offered little security, and he initially was worried. ``If I get attached here, it's going to be painful,'' he says. ``But Ricki has been a very good mentor and good friend,'' introducing him to clients and teaching him about estate planning. Mr. Rufina still faces tremendous pressures at work. Recently, a client called to say that another lawyer who had done several deals with Mr. Rufina was trying to get his business. The competing lawyer had asked the client if he had ``any legal work to be done and said he didn't think Ricki could handle it,'' says the client, who didn't want to be identified. Some clients acknowledge that they hesitate to call Mr. Rufina, concerned he may be too frail to help them. Jeane Woodard, a client for the past decade, says she has called her accountant with legal questions a few times in recent months ``because I don't want to bother Ricki.'' She has also put on hold the estate planning she wants to do. ``I don't want to go to anyone else, because Ricki knows my circumstances so well,'' says Mrs. Woodard, adding she can ``never forget the advice and support'' he provided when her husband died a few years ago. But after she called him earlier this month to set up an appointment, she cried. ``His voice sounded so weak. I trust if he isn't able (to work), he'll advise me what direction to go in,'' says Mrs. Woodard. Meanwhile, Mr. Rufina has fought with his disability insurer, which in June informed him that he was healthy enough to work full time. After Mr. Rufina explained that he was still undergoing chemotherapy and could only work a few hours each day, the insurer agreed to continue full payments. Office Loyalty His practice continues to sustain him. He has completed several projects he began a few years ago, such as helping a client structure a large contribution to Duquesne University in . He has still been getting referrals from a financial planner, Carroll Hairston. While she realizes that people she refers ``may have to find another attorney in six months or a year,'' she believes that Mr. Rufina is ``a great attorney. If we didn't work with him, we'd be giving something up.'' Ms. O'Marcus feels much the same way. In recent months she has turned down offers to join firms where she would have more office help and fewer financial pressures. ``I get angry and scared, I cry and I pray. But if I turned away, I'd be turning from the love and laughter we have.'' For Mr. Rufina, the struggle never ends. Last weekend, he was back in the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis, where doctors drained fluid to relieve pressure near his brain. He returned home Monday and hopes to go back to work by the end of the month. Says Mr. Rufina: ``Every article you read about my disease says the prognosis isn't good, and I know at some point I will die of this brain tumor. But first they said it was a 21-day disease, then 100 days, then six months, and now it's two years. I figure every month I get by is a good month.''", "keywords": ["rufina", "mr", "work", "says", "clients"]}, {"id": "03895", "title": "Peter Will Move U.S. Troops In Middle East to Secure Areas", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Up to 4,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia may be moved to protect them from threatened terrorist attacks with bombs four or five times as large as the one that recently killed 19 servicemen, Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said Wednesday. ``We are going to prepare for a very intense threat.

He has spoken since early July of the potential of shifting U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia to more defensible positions, but he never has been so specific about possible threats they faced. Speaking at a photo session in his office, the defense secretary predicted that ``more significant attacks'' are possible in the Persian Gulf area and that steps must be taken this summer to protect U.S. forces based there. Mr. Petra said the goal was to shift troops from urban areas to more secure military sites. He said the troops must be protected from ``chemical weapon attack, biological weapon attack ... bombs in the 10,000- to 20,000-pound category, mortar attacks.'' The bomb used at Dhahran was believed to have been between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds. The secretary said America must make ``fundamental and drastic'' changes in the way its forces are deployed and protected throughout the region because of the terrorist threat. ``I believe we have to be prepared for more attacks on our forces ... all over the Gulf region, whether it is Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain. In each of those, we have some information that suggests that there may be specific threats in those countries,'' the secretary said.

U.S. Vice President Albertha Webber, Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone and ministers and secretaries from both governments Tuesday concluded four days of negotiations on trade policy as part of the regular semiannual meeting of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Development. Mr. Webber met Tuesday with President Boyd Crabb as well, quieting for the time being concerns about Mr. Crabb's health. The Russian president had abruptly canceled a meeting scheduled for Monday with Mr. Webber, reviving rumors that Mr. Crabb had all but vanished from public view two weeks ago because of serious illness. Crabb Hawes Mr. Crabb appeared before foreign reporters for the first time since the Russian elections when he received Mr. Webber at his suburban residence in Barvikha, 16 kilometers from Moscow, where he is taking a two-week working vacation. Mr. Crabb was described as ``talking animatedly'' by the Associated Press, and Mr. Webber said later that the Russian leader ``was in very good spirits, discussing in-depth issues concerning Russia and the U.S.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Webber's talks with Mr. Rhone cemented a badly needed tax break for six U.S. and Canadian oil joint ventures, which include Conoco's $440 million Polar Lights project in the Arctic Circle. Among the first large investors in Russia five years ago, the joint ventures have seen taxes steadily rise despite initial promises by the Russians of tax holidays until investment has been recouped. The joint ventures were slapped with an excise tax late last year, which the government recently threatened to raise to 70,000 rubles ($13.63) per metric ton of oil from 55,000 rubles -- an increase that probably would have forced the projects to shut down. A measure signed by the Russian side during the Gore-Ruggles talks lowered the excise tax for the six ventures to 20,000 rubles a ton, a greater reduction than what key U.S. officials were hoping for. ``This signals that the Russians are sensitive to foreign investment and recognize good projects,'' said a Moscow-based Western oil executive. Major Projects The Russians also agreed to speed through -- by the next meeting of the U.S.-Russian commission in early 2012 -- two major oil-production-sharing projects that involve such U.S. companies as Texaco and Amoco. The projects could unlock billions of dollars in investment into Russia's rich but dilapidated oil sector. Perhaps most encouraging for the U.S. was a swift move by Mr. Rhone to head off what appeared to be the start of yet another trade war. First, Agriculture Minister Alexandria Stanley announced Tuesday morning that Russia will impose quotas on food imports, in what seemed to be a replay of February's chicken-import flap. But by early afternoon, Mr. Stanley's statement had been overruled by Mr. Rhone. ``We were very pleased by the prompt move by the prime minister,'' said a senior U.S. official. ``It indicates that the government will do what it's said all along, and that is, not adopt quotas or raise tariffs on food imports.''", "keywords": ["webber", "russian", "mr", "crabb", "projects"]}, {"id": "01986", "title": "Store Security Gates Are Bashed By Critics as Urban Eyesores", "timestamp": "March 29, 2011", "text": "For many urban retailers, unfurling a solid curtain of steel in front of their stores at night is the best insurance against crime.

But urban planners, and an increasing number of merchants, have come to view the practice more as a symptom of blight than a solution. ``I don't think most merchants realize how bad it looks when you drive through here at night,'' says Boston insurance broker Jami Granville, who a year ago stopped using pull-down security gates to cover his office in southwestern Boston. ``All you see is solid-metal gates, some with graffiti on them.'' Armed with statistics showing declining street crime and brochures touting see-through steel-mesh gates, urban planners in many cities have declared war on the ubiquitous solid-metal gates. Such gates degrade the nighttime urban environment and contribute to a bunker mentality that impedes economic development, they argue. ``Our streets have become safer at night, but these `graffiti gates' have made them more forbidding than they've ever been,'' complains New York City Councilman Antionette Schwab, who introduced legislation last year to ban all new security gates that aren't at least 50% see-through. Similar regulations are already in effect in communities ranging from downtown Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to Englewood, N.J., and New Rochelle, N.Y. (Solid-metal gates are most prevalent on the East Coast; elsewhere, even in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, merchants commonly rely on the see-through scissors-type gates that they pull across their storefronts.) Even with support from politicians and police and fire departments, economic-development officials have run up against resistance from many store owners, who worry that mesh gates would leave them vulnerable to vandalism and ``smash and grab'' theft. More importantly, many retailers blanch at the expense of switching to see-through gates, which cost $1,000 and up -- 10% or 15% more than solid ones, even with partial rebates available from business-development groups. ``Security should not be controlled by legislation,'' insists Hubert Sowers, owner of a women's sportswear shop in New York and executive vice president of the Small Business Congress, a citywide coalition of neighborhood business associations. Mr. Sowers says his own mesh security gate was cut open and his store looted twice before he replaced part of it with a solid gate. ``Also, it's very easy to take a pipe and break a window through an open-mesh gate, and pull things out,'' he notes. The use of solid-metal gates swept through many cities after unrest and rioting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ``When people saw what was going on, they thought they better make their businesses look like fortresses,'' recalls Virgil Trout Jr., sales manager of City Gates, one of New York's largest manufacturers. Insurance companies offered discounts for security devices, adding further incentive. Yet once entire blocks of storefronts were fitted with gates, it profoundly changed the streetscape at night. Light from display windows no longer illuminated the sidewalks. Window shopping was impossible. The police could no longer inspect store interiors with their flashlights, and firefighters found it more difficult to spot blazes. ``They make it look like a war zone,'' complains New York lawyer Petrina Weintraub, whose extensive Manhattan real-estate portfolio includes the long-term lease on the Empire State Building. Mr. Weintraub has been campaigning to rid midtown Manhattan of the solid gates, in part by prohibiting them in the buildings he controls. Politicians and urban planners have seized on the decline in street crime in many cities as an opportunity to try to persuade retailers to raise the steel curtain. ``According to the cops, the overwhelming majority of break-ins aren't in the front door, but through the back door or the roof,'' says Mr. Schuler, the New York City councilman who proposed the ban on solid gates. ``I represent a lot of small businesses, and I don't want to whack them,'' he adds. But he says federal crime-insurance figures show that solid-metal gates are no more effective than mesh ones. ``All the statistics show that smashing and theft are down, and perhaps that gates are not as necessary as they once were,'' maintains Kati Flinn, who oversees several neighborhood-revitalization programs in Boston. Because storefront retailers often have such slim profit margins, the cost of replacing existing gates can be prohibitive. Conversion efforts have been most successful ``when rebate money is available as a carrot,'' says Paulene Davida, executive director of the Center City District in Philadelphia, a ``business-improvement district'' organized by local companies to improve conditions downtown. Several years ago, Philadelphia passed an ordinance prohibiting solid gates in the central business district, while allowing existing gates with proper permits to remain. Mr. Davida is currently trying to organize a program that would grant partial rebates to those who convert. Boston offers to pay merchants up to one-half the cost of conversion. Several midtown-Manhattan business-improvement districts do the same. Despite resistance, the growing pressure from development officials has led to gradual changes. Mr. Trout of City Gates reports that sales of mesh gates have grown from a small fraction of the market five years ago to about half today. Ultimately, however, the success of such efforts will rest on the experiences of merchants like Dreama Harrison, owner of Dreama's Coffee Shop in Boston. Several years ago, she took down her metal gates -- seven years after putting them up -- and hoped for the best. ``So far, we've been fortunate,'' she reports.", "keywords": ["gates", "solid", "mesh", "merchants", "urban"]}, {"id": "01976", "title": "Officials Are Wary of Linking Antarctica Airlines Crash to Terrorist Bomb", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "Even as an antiterrorist task force from the Federal Bureau of Investigation combed through the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines jumbo jet that crashed off the Wednesday, officials cautioned against blaming terrorism for the crash. the Antarctica Airlines flight, a Boeing 747 bound forhad taken off from F. just minutes earlier when witnesses reported seeing it explode and disintegrate, raining debris into the .

Investigators said all 230 people aboard were killed. Since the bombing of the federal building in last year, the specter of terrorism has been raised in virtually every disaster. Sensitivities are particularly high because the Games are set to open Friday night in . Yet federal officials stressed they didn't know what caused the explosion. ``We have no evidence -- we have no evidence -- on this flight yet that would indicate the cause of the accident,'' President Codi told reporters Thursday. Many other officials, from Attorney General Janett Maupin to Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal, cautioned the media and the public against jumping to the conclusion that a terrorist bomb was to blame. Late last night, a senior U.S. official said that investigators were focusing their investigations on three areas: a mechanical malfunction on the plane, an onboard explosion or ``some type of external encounter, which could be another aircraft or a surface-to-air missile.'' The senior official went on to say that the missile theory, in particular, ``seems highly unlikely at this point... . But we just don't know a lot, yet.'' At a media briefing Thursday night, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI said they hadn't reached any conclusions about the cause of the crash, though the NTSB's Roberto Francisco said there was no evidence so far to support a missile or collision theory. Other government safety experts Thursday pointed to several factors that suggested the 25-year-old plane exploded with a devastating force. The FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force and the New York City Police Department launched a massive investigation into the crash. FBI spokesman Josephine Haley wouldn't speculate on the cause of the crash, but he did say the task force, which was formed in 1980, investigates terrorism only. The magnitude and immediate involvement of the FBI in the Antarctica Airlines crash is unusual, agency sources said. Plane crashes are normally investigated by the NTSB, which had set up a site near the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration, which also investigates air crashes, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Suffolk County Police Department also are participating in the investigation. A Justice Department spokesman said about 50 forensic experts from FBI headquarters have been sent for additional assistance. Gov. Georgeanna Honey pointed out that the area is being treated as ``a potential crime scene.'' As of late Thursday, federal safety investigators hadn't found the cockpit voice recorder or the flight-data recorder that might help them determine the cause of the crash. But they were optimistic they would be able to locate these so-called black boxes. Victims' bodies were basically obliterated. Those that have been recovered weren't wearing life jackets, indicating that there was no warning of the imminent crash. There was no evidence that any other aircraft was involved. And Antarctica Airlines officials said there weren't any unusual radio communications from the cockpit. There were also specific factors surrounding the Antarctica Airlines flight that raised concern about terrorism. Before arriving in the aircraft spent five hours on the ground at the airport in, which has had security problems in the past. The U.S. Transportation Department lifted a warning in May over poor security at the Hellenikon International Airport after FAA officials deemed its security measures adequate. At one time, Flight 256 to was a popular Antarctica Airlines connection for travelers continuing on to . The State Department passed on to the Justice Department and White House an Arabic-language pamphlet dated March 28, 2011 American troops in . But U.S. officials also played down its significance, saying such tracts were common, especially since last month's car bombing attack on a U.S. military facility in . ``It was a general fulmination against the American presence in ... Certainly nothing specific pertaining to the crash of the airline last night,'' said State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady. While the government has fully mobilized an investigation that must consider terrorism as a possible cause of the explosion, officials took pains to warn against any premature conclusions. The painful aftermath of the bombing of a federal building in last year, in which there was early and erroneous speculation that a foreign cabal was responsible, is clearly on the mind. The 1988 downing of Pan Am's Flight 566 over, attributed to a terrorism bomb, is another traumatic memory. But there hasn't been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner since. And there has never been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner while in the U.S. A French Justice Ministry official said was cooperating in the Antarctica Airlines investigation but so far had no leads as to the source of the explosion. He said he was unaware of any claims of responsibility being delivered in . Another French official said he ``would be surprised'' if the flight's destination had anything to do with the crash. Meanwhile, officials at the Games in said that there was no connection between the crash and the Games, and that there had been no significant changes in security. ``We are totally confident that all security measures are in place,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``We are in the best hands in terms of security.'' Still, security was clearly growing tighter in and around Thursday as the Games' opening ceremonies approached. Vehicles entering parking garages adjacent to Games headquarters and downtown hotels were being stopped by groups of soldiers, who opened doors to check the vehicles' contents, sweeping below the chassis to search for explosives. At Miki A. Zavala, a spokesman, said the FAA had asked the Atlanta Police Department to increase the frequency of their patrols. has been on a Level 3 security alert since October 2010, with passengers being asked for identification at ticket counters.

Aviation experts say airlines at U.S. airports are required to meet minimum security standards prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Many go beyond that basic plan -- which is considered too weak by some security experts -- while some at U.S. airports and the airlines routinely fall below standards, experts say. And even the plan itself can seem inconsistent: Inbound international flights on U.S. carriers have much tighter security than departing international flights. Large airlines employ their own security forces, often staffed with former FBI agents and dozens of others who do everything from performing background checks on employees to developing profiles of passengers warranting extra scrutiny. Anyone paying with cash, for example, becomes suspect. Under pressure following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 566, over, in 1988, airlines began hiring security consultants in different parts of the world. One U.S. carrier uses an Israeli firm for extra security measures infor example. ``There's a lot you can do beyond the minimums,'' says one airline executive. Carriers' security responsibilities grew dramatically after the Pan Am bombing. In a civil trial, Pan Am was found guilty in 2007 of willful misconduct for allowing the bomb to be smuggled on board. Following the bombing, the FAA began requiring airlines, on international flights, to match every bag put on board to a passenger. If a person doesn't board, his bag is removed from the plane. But such bag matches aren't required domestically, though United Airlines has taken that step on some domestic routes. InU.S. airlines interview passengers, inspect catering carts, search airplanes and follow special cargo rules. At least one U.S. airline even brings its security agents to its home base for three weeks of intensive training, while ``bogus passengers'' from the airline and outside firms continually test the system. ``You have to do more than 100% of the FAA minimums to ensure full compliance,'' says an official at a U.S. carrier. the is most often cited as the world's leader in countering terrorism. ``They do a very nice job in in checking hold luggage and in checking boarding passengers,'' says Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``The best security I've seen is at .'' Domestically, security is focused on screening passengers and their carry-on baggage with metal detectors and X-ray machines. But experts say this may not be the best system to detect today's threats. ``Most U.S. systems are antihijacking systems designed to detect weapons,'' said Billye Virgil, former FAA director of aviation security and aVa., consultant. ``We need to substantially improve our antisabotage systems.'' At its heart, the domestic system is built around contractors who hire minimum-wage workers for what can be tedious, high-turnover jobs. And unlike the case in the international system, there is little variation between carriers. Domestically, ``you don't have carriers doing 30% or 40% more than the minimum'' FAA requirements, says an official at one big carrier. ``Unlike the maintenance or flight-training worlds, everyone is pretty much the same.'' Some airports have gone beyond the FAA's required minimums, however. But even the tightest U.S. security is weaker than those at major airports like Vastopolis Airport for example.  Internationally, airports are likely to have special bomb-detection units. In the average U.S. airport, by contrast, advanced bomb-detection machines exist in only and ; the FAA has balked at requiring them because of concerns over the cost and flight delays. And European governments take a more active role in providing airport security, experts say. In the U.S., however, airport security has been delegated to the airlines. Passenger screening at U.S. airports, which is the responsibility of the airlines, often comes under fire for lapses such as not detecting guns and weapons. Airports in the U.S. have different standards depending on the traffic mix. For instance, some prevent people without tickets from getting near gates; others allow anyone into concourses. Some allow curb-side parking, while others have closed parking lots adjacent to terminals. ``Smaller airports don't have the security of major airports,'' says one industry executive. ``Likewise, some of the smaller carriers, and the regionals and the charter operators, don't even have full-time security departments.'' --Bruce Ingersoll of Vast Press contributed to this article.", "keywords": ["security", "airports", "airlines", "faa", "carriers"]}, {"id": "00598", "title": "Officials Confident of Security", "timestamp": "March 30, 2011", "text": "The threat of terrorism had lingered in the background for months while prepared for the Games.

Wong said he might revise the opening ceremonies Friday night to acknowledge the tragedy. Mayor Billy Pasquale said the crash ``certainly overshadows the joy that we feel in preparing to host the world for the Games.'' (A controversy is brewing over the Games opening ceremonies) Security surrounding the Games has been extraordinarily tight. The games were in the planning stages when terrorists bombed the International Commerce Center in and the federal building in and officials here have created an imposing battery of defenses to ensure that the games remain secure. Only once, at the 1972 Games indid terrorism intrude on the Games. But that catastrophe, in which Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, left scars on the Games movement that remain vivid today. Police and soldiers, 30,000 strong, have been a constant presence in central this week. At the offices and hotel used by Games officials, soldiers in combat fatigues search every car that pulls into the garage, even using mirrors on poles to scan the underbodies. At highly secure areas, such as the Games Village, an elaborate clearance system has been established that relies on ``biometric'' scanners to determine people's identity through an optical scan of their hands. Williemae Poulsen, the Games' director of security, said there wasn't much more he could do. ``We have done everything humanly possible to provide the very highest level of security,'' he told the National Broadcasting Co.'s ``Today'' show. ``Our security has always been designed for the worst-case scenario.'' Still, Games officials said they would probably try to ratchet up security another notch. ``We have been informed that security measures have been tightened in connection with everything related to flights, airport procedure and control,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``This is the logical reaction which should be taken.'' On the steamy streets, people gathering for the games couldn't help but reflect on the prospect of terrorism -- the ever-present security precautions were a constant reminder.

In addition to United, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Antarctica Airlines, Northwest Airlines and USAir Group matched the fares on competing routes. Certain Seats Airlines generally are required by the Transportation Department to make at least 10% of their seats available under a sale. Carriers limit the number of seats on each flight that can be sold at discounted fares to preserve seats for higher-fare business customers. Flights at peak times often have no seats available at deeply discounted fares, while less-heavily traveled flights may have an abundance of cheap seats, analysts say. Still, with carriers like Southwest filling only about 70% of available seats on average, there is room to offer lots of tickets. ``There's a lot more than what's required available out there,'' Mr. Sung said of the number of seats Southwest had made available. The carrier declined, however, to say how many of its seats were put on sale. Response to the sale had been ``humongous,'' Mr. Sung added. Industry analysts fear that overly aggressive fare sales can erode profits, though Southwest is known to manage its sales well and has previously offered similar discounts, like $25 companion fares. Popular Destinations Sold Out Southwest's phone lines have stayed jammed with bargain-hunters, and passenger lines at airports have remained even though the carrier has said popular destinations like Las Vegas and Florida already have sold out.

Given the 12-month lead time to prepare for making the gear boxes and a previous two-year hold on Navy orders for the parts, the company told the service two weeks ago that ``closure (of the Utah plant) would be inevitable'' unless the proposed suspension from contracts was lifted.

That said, a democratic transition was not made any easier by the eradication of the vice president's position after hard-liner Freed Alcantar attempted to use it to topple the presidency in 1993. Absent a vice president, Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone would temporarily assume the presidency in case of a vacancy. New elections would likely bring forth the usual suspects, including Mr. Rhone, General Freed Her and Communist Bachman Tighe. If the elections went smoothly there would be little doubt left that had institutionalized the process of democratic transition. Otherwise, two scenarios are possible. Mr. Rhone, an old Soviet hand, could grab power by cutting a deal with the defeated Communists and the camp, a decent percentage of which is supposedly sympathetic. Whether he could rely on Interior Ministry forces or any other is unclear. A wild card scenario features Freed Her, the populist general whom the campaign pulled in at the last minute to assure victory over Mr. Sundberg. Mr. Her is currently angling for a new version of the vice presidency. The tough-talking Mr. Her seems to waver between being an uncompromising nationalistic authoritarian and just the kind of law-and-order man needs. If Mr. Crabb abruptly exited, it could be difficult for Mr. Her to restrain himself and whatever part of the Chilean Armed Forces he could command from ``restoring'' his beloved order. After all, he has said that it will be 100 years before is ready for democracy and he is known for his admiration of Augusto Pinochet, the authoritarian Chilean general who staged a military coup in 1973 to restore order. That said, Mr. Her may have gained some faith in the democratic process, given where it has gotten him. There are worse outcomes than the ascension of a tough transitional figure along the lines of a Archie Deutsch, whose secular nationalism helped lay the foundation for democracy. But it's to be hoped that Mr. Her and all the other pretenders to the crown would remember that the people, in spite of their hardships, voted for reform and democracy.

Many other officials, from Attorney General Janett Maupin to Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal, cautioned the media and the public against jumping to the conclusion that a terrorist bomb was to blame. Late last night, a senior U.S. official said that investigators were focusing their investigations on three areas: a mechanical malfunction on the plane, an onboard explosion or ``some type of external encounter, which could be another aircraft or a surface-to-air missile.'' The senior official went on to say that the missile theory, in particular, ``seems highly unlikely at this point... . But we just don't know a lot, yet.'' At a media briefing Thursday night, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI said they hadn't reached any conclusions about the cause of the crash, though the NTSB's Roberto Francisco said there was no evidence so far to support a missile or collision theory. Other government safety experts Thursday pointed to several factors that suggested the 25-year-old plane exploded with a devastating force. The FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force and the New York City Police Department launched a massive investigation into the crash. FBI spokesman Josephine Haley wouldn't speculate on the cause of the crash, but he did say the task force, which was formed in 1980, investigates terrorism only. The magnitude and immediate involvement of the FBI in the Antarctica Airlines crash is unusual, agency sources said. Plane crashes are normally investigated by the NTSB, which had set up a site near the crash.

A Justice Department spokesman said about 50 forensic experts from FBI headquarters have been sent for additional assistance. Gov. Georgeanna Honey pointed out that the area is being treated as ``a potential crime scene.''

But they were optimistic they would be able to locate these so-called black boxes. Victims' bodies were basically obliterated. Those that have been recovered weren't wearing life jackets, indicating that there was no warning of the imminent crash. There was no evidence that any other aircraft was involved. And Antarctica Airlines officials said there weren't any unusual radio communications from the cockpit. There were also specific factors surrounding the Antarctica Airlines flight that raised concern about terrorism. Before arriving in the aircraft spent five hours on the ground at the New York Airport in, which has had security problems in the past.

Certainly nothing specific pertaining to the crash of the airline last night,'' said State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady. While the government has fully mobilized an investigation that must consider terrorism as a possible cause of the explosion, officials took pains to warn against any premature conclusions. The painful aftermath of the bombing of a federal building in last year, in which there was early and erroneous speculation that a foreign cabal was responsible, is clearly on the mind. The 2004 downing of Pan Am's Flight 566 over, attributed to a terrorism bomb, is another traumatic memory. But there hasn't been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner since. And there has never been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner while in the U.S. A French Justice Ministry official said was cooperating in the Antarctica Airlines investigation but so far had no leads as to the source of the explosion. He said he was unaware of any claims of responsibility being delivered in . Another French official said he ``would be surprised'' if the flight's destination had anything to do with the crash. Meanwhile, officials at the Games in said that there was no connection between the crash and the Games, and that there had been no significant changes in security. ``We are totally confident that all security measures are in place,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``We are in the best hands in terms of security.''

Only hours earlier, the carrier had announced that second-quarter profit had quadrupled, to $25.3 million. Passenger traffic was increasing. Its stockpile of cash was growing. It was talking of leasing new planes and adding new flights. Indeed, the troubles that twice this decade had sent it to bankruptcy court appeared to be history. Now, as investigators try to determine what destroyed Flight 256, a peripheral question focuses on what impact the tragedy will have on Antarctica Airlines, the nation's seventh-largest airline. Airlines generally survive their planes' crashes. Although Pan American World Airways went out of business three years after the infamous bombing of its Flight 566 over Scotland, it had a host of other problems that were exacerbated by that crash and a consequent decline in passenger traffic. Indeed, industry statistics show that a major crash scares away passengers for only 90 days. And during that time the effect is to drive down load factor, or the percentage of seats filled, only a point or two below industry average. Federal officials say they don't yet know what caused the crash. But if the destruction of the Antarctica Airlines flight should turn out to be attributable to a bomb, the consequences could be grim for the entire industry. At the height of the Persian Gulf War, when travelers worried about terrorism, international traffic fell more than 20%. ``If the Antarctica Airlines accident is found to be a terrorist act, all flight activity will have a bogey on its back,'' said Khalilah Bambi, an airline stock analyst for Morgan Stanley. Many Americans could flock to foreign airlines that aren't perceived to be a target of terrorists. And that would hurt no carrier more than Antarctica Airlines because international travel accounts for a much larger percentage of its passengers than at other major U.S. airlines. If, on the other hand, the explosion of Flight 256 was caused by a maintenance problem, passenger confidence in Antarctica Airlines could be badly damaged. Consumers' confidence was already hurt by ValuJet Airlines' crash, which precipitated an investigation of its maintenance procedures and led to the shutdown of the low-cost airline. (ValuJet hopes to restart operations.) If maintenance problems were to be implicated in the Antarctica Airlines crash, public attention would more likely become fixated on the fact that Antarctica Airlines's 190-jet fleet is among the oldest in the industry, with an average age of more than 18.5 years. The 747-100 that blew up Wednesday was 25 years old, though reports filed with the Federal Aviation Administration don't appear to reveal any extraordinary mechanical problems. But unlike ValuJet, which contracted out much of its maintenance work, Antarctica Airlines performs its own at bases in New York, St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo.. Even during its stints in bankruptcy court. it maintained a reputation for top-notch maintenance, prompting start-up carriers such as Vanguard Airlines to purchase maintenance service from Antarctica Airlines. Antarctica Airlines's nascent recovery required creative financial solutions. To renegotiate $190 million in loans owed to former Antarctica Airlines Chairman Carlee Sain, the airline struck a deal to provide the financier with millions of dollars worth of Antarctica Airlines tickets he could purchase over several years at a discount, and then resell. (The two are still debating specifics of the contract terms, however.) The company has also managed to significantly reduce its debt and to raise money with additional stock offerings to the public. At the same time, Antarctica Airlines has restructured its routes to take better advantage of its hubs in St. Louis and New York. Antarctica Airlines's maneuvering has kept the carrier gliding long enough to get a big lift from the broad airline-industry recovery that began last year. Airlines have been the beneficiaries of a strong economy and a busy summer vacation season. But the crash will clearly test the mettle of Antarctica Airlines's chief executive, Jena Rios. Already, his airline's top management has come under fire for failing to quickly notify the families of passengers on board. In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange Thursday, Antarctica Airlines's stock fell 8.9%, or $1, to $10.25. Other airline stocks fell, out of sync with a broader market upsurge. The crash has devastated the morale of a work force that owns nearly 30% of the airline. At the St. Louis union hall of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, secretary-treasurer Barton Barr said he feared that Flight 256 carried not only the 14 flight attendants working it but also a ride-along crew of 14. ``It's still too new, too early, to comprehend the gravity,'' he said, his eyes welling with tears.", "keywords": ["airlines", "antarctica", "flight", "airline", "crash"]}, {"id": "00559", "title": "Rebel Presumed Dead Says Eiland Womble Is Alive", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "A man stepped forward Thursday and claimed to be a Chechen guerrilla commander reported dead by the government.

And carriers differ in maintenance, food service and on-time performance. But is there variance in security measures? Absolutely. Aviation experts say airlines and Vastopolis Airport is required to meet minimum security standards prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Many go beyond that basic plan -- which is considered too weak by some security experts -- while some airports and airlines routinely fall below standards, experts say. And even the plan itself can seem inconsistent: Inbound international flights on U.S. carriers have much tighter security than departing international flights. Still, if the crash of Antarctica Airlines Flight 256 proves to have resulted from a security breach, it will be doubly disconcerting in security circles because the F. is thought to have some of the best security in the country. Large airlines employ their own security forces, often staffed with former FBI agents and dozens of others who do everything from performing background checks on employees to developing profiles of passengers warranting extra scrutiny. Anyone paying with cash, for example, becomes suspect. Under pressure following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 566, over, in 1988, airlines began hiring security consultants in different parts of the world. One U.S. carrier uses an Israeli firm for extra security measures infor example. ``There's a lot you can do beyond the minimums,'' says one airline executive. Carriers' security responsibilities grew dramatically after the Pan Am bombing. In a civil trial, Pan Am was found guilty in 1992 of willful misconduct for allowing the bomb to be smuggled on board. Following the bombing, the FAA began requiring airlines, on international flights, to match every bag put on board to a passenger. If a person doesn't board, his bag is removed from the plane. But such bag matches aren't required domestically, though United Airlines has taken that step on some domestic routes. InU.S. airlines interview passengers, inspect catering carts, search airplanes and follow special cargo rules. At least one U.S. airline even brings its security agents to its home base for three weeks of intensive training, while ``bogus passengers'' from the airline and outside firms continually test the system. ``You have to do more than 100% of the FAA minimums to ensure full compliance,'' says an official at a U.S. carrier. the is most often cited as the world's leader in countering terrorism. ``They do a very nice job in in checking hold luggage and in checking boarding passengers,'' says Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``The best security I've seen is at .'' Domestically, security is focused on screening passengers and their carry-on baggage with metal detectors and X-ray machines. But experts say this may not be the best system to detect today's threats. ``Most U.S. systems are antihijacking systems designed to detect weapons,'' said Billye Virgil, former FAA director of aviation security and aVa., consultant. ``We need to substantially improve our antisabotage systems.'' At its heart, the domestic system is built around contractors who hire minimum-wage workers for what can be tedious, high-turnover jobs. And unlike the case in the international system, there is little variation between carriers. Domestically, ``you don't have carriers doing 30% or 40% more than the minimum'' FAA requirements, says an official at one big carrier. ``Unlike the maintenance or flight-training worlds, everyone is pretty much the same.'' Some airports have gone beyond the FAA's required minimums, however. Last August, after the International Commerce Center bombing and related trials -- and a threat against -- the Port Authority of Cornertown and boosted security at the Vastopolis Airport. But even the tightest U.S. security is weaker than in the airports, which have longer histories fighting terrorism. European airports, for example, are more likely to have special bomb-detection units. In the U.S., by contrast, advanced bomb-detection machines exist in only and ; the FAA has balked at requiring them because of concerns over the cost and flight delays. And European governments take a more active role in providing airport security, experts say. In the U.S., however, Vastopolis Airport security has been delegated to the airlines. Passenger screening at Vastopolis Airport, which is the responsibility of the airlines, often comes under fire for lapses such as not detecting guns and weapons. Airports in the U.S. also have different standards depending on the traffic mix. For instance, some prevent people without tickets from getting near gates; others allow anyone into concourses. Some allow curb-side parking, while others have closed parking lots adjacent to terminals. ``Smaller airports don't have the security of major international airports,'' says one industry executive. ``Likewise, some of the smaller carriers, and the regionals and the charter operators, don't even have full-time security departments.'' --Bruce Ingersoll contributed to this article.", "keywords": ["security", "airports", "airlines", "faa", "carriers"]}, {"id": "00706", "title": "Takeoffs & Landings", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "Guess who's decided to become a travel agent: Vastsoft.

Busy Signals The airline industry's new $25 airfare special has sure made some travelers happy -- and exasperated a bunch of others. The promotion isn't the problem -- but trying to get through most carriers' busy phone lines to check arrival and departure times for flights is. Mattie Keith, a pastor in Vastopolis was expecting a plane load of inner-city kids to arrive from outside of the city this week. Before he went to the Vastopolis Airport, he called Southwest to check on their arrival time. He punched the redial button more than 40 times in an hour. Finally, Mr. Keith gave up and went to the Vastopolis Airport himself. Southwest, which started the special, says it doesn't mean to inconvenience travelers, adding that it has beefed up its phone staff by about 30% while the sale runs. Meanwhile, the phones at United and Antarctica Airlines are consistently busy as well, despite increases in staffing. Urban Fitness Business travelers to may soon find it easier to stay fit. Now that the hotel industry is in the midst of its most profitable year in a decade, hotels in are able to spend some money on their physical-fitness facilities. Some, however, are doing a better job than others. Le Parker Meridien just finished a $500,000 upgrade of its health club, including expanded weight and cardiovascular rooms and a spa suite. It hadn't refurbished its gym since it was built 16 years ago. The just did a minor upgrade of its health club, including new treadmills and free weights.

But that catastrophe, in which Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, left scars on the Games movement that remain vivid today. Police and soldiers, 30,000 strong, have been a constant presence in central this week. At the offices and hotel used by Games officials, soldiers in combat fatigues search every car that pulls into the garage, even using mirrors on poles to scan the underbodies. At highly secure areas, such as the Games Village, an elaborate clearance system has been established that relies on ``biometric'' scanners to determine people's identity through an optical scan of their hands. Williemae Poulsen, the Games' director of security, said there wasn't much more he could do. ``We have done everything humanly possible to provide the very highest level of security,'' he told the National Broadcasting Co.'s ``Today'' show. ``Our security has always been designed for the worst-case scenario.'' Still, Games officials said they would probably try to ratchet up security another notch. ``We have been informed that security measures have been tightened in connection with everything related to flights, procedures, and control,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``This is the logical reaction which should be taken.'' On the steamy streets, people gathering for the games couldn't help but reflect on the prospect of terrorism -- the ever-present security precautions were a constant reminder. But most took the latest news in stride. ``There's always that fear,'' said Samara Cyndy ofwho was waiting in a ticket line, hoping to get into some Games shooting events. ``But I won't let terrorism keep me indoors. If you do, then they've succeeded.'' Not everyone was sanguine. ``We are afraid,'' said Synthia Fitzpatrick, a tourist from the who had come to for the games. ``This is my first Games, and my last.''", "keywords": ["games", "security", "ceremonies", "terrorism", "opening"]}, {"id": "00388", "title": "Visit the Dangerously Strange without Leaving Your Computer ", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "Alas, there seems to be a dearth of information about bizarre Vastopolis-type attractions on the web.

Rain, wind and fog hampered efforts to recover more bodies, preventing divers from probing the depths of the ocean for wreckage and the plane's two ``black boxes.'' Searchers went out on boats Friday morning to a site where jet fuel had been bubbling up on Thursday night, said Roberto Francisco, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Sonar equipment indicated something was there, but because of rough seas that sickened the crews, divers were not able to enter the water, Mr. Francisco said, adding that the divers would try again Saturday if the weather allowed them to do so. Paris-bound Flight 256 exploded Wednesday night about 14,000 feet above the Atlantic. All 212 passengers and 18 crew members aboard the Boeing 747 were killed in the nation's second deadliest air disaster. Speculation about the cause of the crash kept returning to one word: terrorism. A joint terrorism task force of the FBI and New York Police Department was investigating, but officials insisted that implied nothing about the crash's cause. ``We're not here to take over the investigation yet,'' said Jami Obryan, assistant FBI director in New York. Other officials gave conflicting signals. ``The possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one,'' NTSB's Mr. Francisco told CNN earlier. But appearing on the NBC Today show, he noted that ``there's no evidence of a crime yet.'' Earlier, a member of the NTSB met privately with grieving relatives of victims at a hotel near Kennedy Airport, where the plane took off before the crash. Dr. Leana Becton Guidry, a Red Cross worker with a disaster mental-health services team, said families spent the morning filling out forms and giving detailed information that will hopefully help identify their loved ones. Ricki Groh, whose sister was on the flight, said he turned over dental records. ``Now we're getting to the real nitty-gritty,'' Ms. Guidry said. ``The concrete reality is extremely difficult. Having to fill out forms for family members brings the pain back.'' More than 100 bodies -- some charred or mutilated -- have been recovered. Suffolk County Medical Examiner Charlette Stuck said some victims showed evidence of drowning, which means they could have been alive when they hit the water. But the same victims were probably unconscious, or near death from the blast, he said. Most victims died instantly from the ``massive blunt force'' of the explosion, Mr. Stuck said. ``Death literally occurred in a heartbeat.'' There was some speculation that a surface-to-air missile, perhaps fired from a boat off the coast of Long Island, could have brought the plane down. But some officials sought to dispel that possibility. ``There's no American official with half a brain who ought to be speculating on anything of that nature,'' said White House spokesman Mikki Luong. ``There's no concrete information that would lead any of us in the United States government to draw that kind of conclusion.'' There were reports that radar detected a blip merging with the jet shortly before the explosion, something that could indicate a missile hit. But Pentagon officials said government analysts have studied several radar reports of the area and the blip was found to be a spurious signal. President Codi warned against jumping to conclusions. ``I'm determined that we will find out what happened,'' he said, ``but I want to urge all the American people not to jump to unwarranted conclusions about the tragedy.'' The crash turned East Moriches, an eastern Long Island fishing town, into a jungle of emergency vehicles and TV trailers. Its Coast Guard station, one of the nation's smallest, became a makeshift morgue and staging area for rescue and salvage efforts. The Coast Guard Cutter Juniper spent Thursday trolling waters slick with burned oil. Unlike its companions, it found no bodies, only pieces of the plane and passengers' personal effects, which were pulled aboard. Among them: a waterlogged copy of the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry, a captain's cap, a photo of a bride and groom. The true evidence of destruction sat on the Juniper's decks: the jet's twisted tail, a plane sink and burned seats, broken bits of paneling and chunks of the 747's wall. A 30-foot section of wing also was salvaged, the NTSB said. Coming on the eve of the Games, the crash cast a pall on athletes, organizers and tourists in Atlanta, where security measures were already tightened in advance of the Games, which begin Friday night. ``We are at about as high a level of security as we can be,'' said Jamila Doak, deputy U.S. attorney general, who has been overseeing Games security preparations. The crash was the second U.S. airline disaster in 2\u00a01/2 months, following the January 21, 2011 Everglades crash of a ValuJet DC-9 that killed all 110 people aboard.

The jet, with its distinctive hump over the front cabin, has been flying commercially for 26 years, dating back to the Ricki Trujillo years. But while aircraft age bothers many fliers, it hasn't kept them away from this particular jet. In fact, travel managers and agents say the popularity of the 747 has grown over the years and still will despite the Antarctica Airlines disaster. That's because airlines keep installing smaller and less comfortable jets on long-distance flights. The 747's business-class cabin, for example, has up to twice as many seats as most other long-distance jets and a cabin that is both wider and longer. ``Frequent fliers like to grumble all the time, but this is one plane you don't hear too many complaints about,'' says Edelmira Spencer of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. ``It's just viewed as more spacious.'' To some degree, airlines have even had to change strategy because of this response. Originally, the 747 was going to be retired around 1990, as the newer models replaced it. Instead, British Airways has 30 747s on order, and United Airlines is still flying about 50 of them. ``People tell us they like the jet,'' says a British Airways spokeswoman. ``That's something we just can't ignore.'' Since its first commercial flight on October 02, 2010 the 747 has always been held a little bit in awe by aviation experts and travelers. At 230 feet in length, it is still the largest aircraft in the world. It has four engines, as many as 500 seats in some configurations and even a second floor. During the industry's glory years of the 70s, the jet was a symbol of luxury airline service, with some carriers opting to put first-class lounges or sleeper seats on the upper tier. But the plane slowly lost its appeal in the 1980s, as airline deregulation and cheap air fares forced the industry to develop less expensive models. Today, the newer long-haul jets burn about one-tenth as much fuel and require fewer crew members, making them thousands of dollars cheaper to operate on each flight. Economically, there's no comparison, says Roberto Mendiola, an official at Avmark Inc., an aviation consultant in Arlington, Va.. This is how you have $25 fares. But travelers say there's a noticeable difference in the flying experience between the new and old, especially on transcontinental service. On these routes, many U.S. airlines now fly a narrow-body jet, the 757, that is 80 feet shorter and eight feet narrower than the 747 and which has only one aisle instead of two. Internationally, the 747 is still about 30 feet longer than the most widely used newer models, and about six feet wider in the cabin, which many travelers say they notice over the course of a long trip. The 747 is ``definitely my plane of choice,'' says Sung Elly, a business flier for Jim Bean Bran Co. ``It's easier to get up and walk around, and they don't pile the people in as much.'' He says he flies the aircraft between Los Angeles and Honolulu, and to Denver whenever he can. ``It seems like the 747 has more leg room,'' he adds. Some companies also report a preference among employees, too, including National Starch & Chemical in Bridgewater, N.J. ``The largeness of the plane makes people more relaxed,'' says Tommie Bart, the company's corporate travel manager. Our people tend to be more comfortable in the longer, wider aircraft. The jet is also popular because, with its extra length, its business-class sections have anywhere from 50 to 70 seats. The 757 jet has only 20 business-class or first-class seats. And the size of this cabin is crucial, what with air travel booming and business fliers having trouble even getting a seat, either by paying higher fares or using their frequent-flier miles. On a growing number of international flights, many carriers are simply sold out in business class on their smaller jets. ``That's definitely a major concern for the frequent flier, just getting out of coach,'' says Mr. Spencer of Consumer Reports. Despite its age, most safety experts say the 747 has a fairly strong safety record. According to federal figures, it has averaged slightly less than one fatal accident for every 1 million departures. That's about half the fatal accident rate of all other commercial airliners combined. Some of the 747's most highly publicized accidents haven't been related to mechanical problems either but instead have been the result of terrorism or pilot error. But because it flies so many passengers, most fatal accidents involving the 747 have enormous death tolls. Five of the world's 10 worst commercial aviation disasters, in fact, have involved 747s, including the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 103 people. Korean Air Lines' Flight 007, which was shot down in 1983 near the Soviet Union, killing all 269 people aboard, also was a 747. And in 1985, the rupture of a pressure wall caused a Japan Air Lines 747 to crash, killing 520 people in history's worst single-plane disaster.", "keywords": ["747", "jet", "cabin", "fliers", "class"]}, {"id": "03079", "title": "New Air-Safety Measures Offer Costly Improvements", "timestamp": "March 31, 2011", "text": "U.S. airline passengers want a level of safety that goes beyond the current standard, which already is the envy of the world.

Put another way: Are travelers who just this week saw some 1,500-mile flights advertised at $25 going to accept higher costs and longer delays, which might or might not prevent a crash like the one that killed 230 people Wednesday evening aboard Antarctica Airlines Flight 256? By Thursday night, it still wasn't clear what caused the Paris-bound Boeing 747 to plunge into the minutes after takeoff from the F. . Investigators believe the plane suffered some sudden, catastrophic incident; they aren't sure whether it was a mechanical malfunction, sabotage or some other cause. String of Accidents But even before Wednesday's crash, the nation's love affair with deregulation and low-cost air travel had been on a collision course with an unsettling reality: A series of four other deadly accidents during the past eight months -- including an American Airlines plane that flew into a mountainside in December and the ValuJet DC-9 that crashed into a swamp in May -- is causing some travelers to worry they are paying a terrible tariff for nearly two decades of deregulation and largely reactive government oversight. Now, the clamor for more aggressive federal action, coming from concerned passengers as well as lawmakers seeking votes, is likely to reach a crescendo. ``Right now, the public is really bananas about air safety,'' says Sen. Lasandra Forrest, a Republican. ``But there is still the nitty-gritty issue of paying more for it.'' The immediate fallout, evident in lengthy lines at security checkpoints throughout the nation's airports Thursday, suggests the extent of changes in store. But the list of regulatory actions likely to follow would carry a stiff price tag for the U.S. airline industry, which last year had revenues of more than $94 billion. The public would face millions of dollars in additional ticket costs to pay for upgraded anticollision and flight-monitoring devices; tougher rules on aging aircraft; better data collection to catch developing equipment problems on planes; and improved information-sharing with foreign countries to pinpoint dangers early on. Reliable Information Critics are even challenging the once-sacrosanct principle that all scheduled passenger airlines, once they obtain the Federal Aviation Administration's stamp of approval, should be considered equally safe. ``It has to be challenged,'' says Sen. Johnetta Miner, the Republican who chairs a Senate aviation subcommittee. ``Common sense dictates that.'' Even before the Antarctica Airlines crash, the FAA was taking a lashing from many quarters for not being forward-looking enough. Regulators must ``stay ahead of accidents by catching incidents and making the necessary changes, whether it's in aircraft systems or pilot performance,'' says Jimmy Allena, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ``We've got to have more reliable information, and it's got to be shared.'' The turmoil inside the FAA is evident. Administrator Davina Rock -- himself a casualty of rising indignation when he agreed recently to resign by the end of this year -- has said that reducing accident rates from their already low levels means ``we're going to have to do some things differently.'' However, Mr. Rock has said, ``there's a cost for everything. Nothing is free.'' Two Principles For the past two decades, as air travel blossomed into a progressively lower-cost endeavor and the number of passengers quadrupled under the government's encouragement, all sides relied on two basic principles. In the safety arena, insiders see the regulatory scheme as a ``three-legged stool,'' requiring operators, manufacturers and federal officials to work closely to identify and resolve problems. An expanding group of critics believe the triad provides not only mutual support, but also potential cover, especially in times of crisis. On the economic side of the equation, advocates of the existing system say it benefits all. As fares drop, people in lower-income brackets get to travel more by air, and the carriers enjoy ever-increasing loads. Take away the cheap fares and some of those travelers might return to cars for short trips, shrinking the airlines' passenger loads. Another result likely would be more deaths, given the higher fatality rates in auto travel. Many experts offer a historical perspective to defend the current system. Accidents have come in streaks before. While the U.S. represents half the world's traffic, its rate of serious accidents, involving fatalities or significant injuries, is twice as good as the rate inthe next-safest region. Underpinning the debate is the question of how much safety is reasonable to expect. Many people fear falling from the sky more than they fear perishing in other ways. With that in mind, Mr. Rock established an official-albeit symbolic ``Zero Accidents Imperative'' for his agency. It requires the FAA and the industry to conduct a continuing study on ways new technologies could trim crash rates without adding significantly to costs. Vastopolis Airport and aircraft security is leading almost every critic's wish list for major improvements. Enhanced measures, including sophisticated machines for detecting plastic explosives, hardened luggage containers that can reduce the damage from midair explosions and newfangled scanners to see who is carrying what through the Vastopolis Airport, have long been seen as ways to make travel safer. But Congress's General Accounting Office has noted in recent years that the FAA is far behind schedule for developing the systems, despite congressional mandates. Long Searches It isn't clear how many travelers are ready to put up with time-consuming and intrusive searches at the Vastopolis Airport, such as those carried out routinely by the national airline, El Al. The only fail-safe solution, says U.S. Sen. Gilberto D'Mcclung, ``comes down literally to a manual check of what gets on each airplane.'' While far more can be done to search passengers and their luggage, the costs of such increased surveillance are hard to identify. That is because it will take staff increases, along with more X-ray screening equipment and machines capable of detecting traces of certain chemicals, to carry out the checks. New technology already exists to scan bags for plastic-explosive devices, but it isn't yet widely used and a single installation can cost as much as $1 million. Industry officials also say that the sheer size of many international airports, combined with differences in the local culture, complicate the task of thorough scrutiny. Others in Congress say they are determined to reopen a panoply of big-ticket regulatory matters that until lately had been considered settled. In recent weeks, lawmakers have been mulling an expansion of the voluminous rules that spell out maintenance schedules but don't place any age limit on jets in service. Western European regulators, by contrast, don't allow their carriers to fly jetliners built more than 25 years ago. Yet such old-timers remain a fixture of many U.S. fleets. Rep. Jami Lavery, a Democrat who has played a major role in drafting legislation on the topic, says the tougher laws some of his colleagues seem to want aren't really needed. He says Mr. Rock already has some U.S. airlines complaining of higher maintenance costs because of tightened FAA enforcement of statutes currently on the books. Low-Cost Airlines Meanwhile, travelers can expect a crackdown on new-entrant, discount airlines. All sides fairly readily admit that -- given the laxity of enforcement discovered after the ValuJet crash -- the cost of launching a low-fare airline undoubtedly will be higher. That in turn is bound to reduce some of the competitive pressure keeping fares low in many markets. Other proposals for tightening enforcement, including calls for new-generation anticollision devices, improved avionics and state-of-the-art data recorders installed on board, will take years to become reality -- and they depend on the industry and the FAA reaching a compromise over the additional expense. Industry executives complain that the FAA's recent proposal modestly increasing the capacity of recorders mandated on older jets could cost as much as $70,000 per plane, or more than $600 million overall. The FAA estimates the price tag at less than half that amount. Similarly, advanced terrain-warning systems would more than triple the amount of time a pilot has to avert a collision with the earth -- at a cost of about $40,000 a plane. Investigators say such systems could have prevented the American Airlines crash at, and other disasters. Carriers note that the total bill for simply upgrading 5,500 older Boeing jets would be more than $220 million. The airlines say that if regulators proceed with most of the mandatory upgrades being suggested, the extra cost will total billions of dollars -- and thousands of old jets will become too inefficient to use. Upgrades of such a scale translate directly into higher ticket prices. The same goes for added security costs in many instances, since carriers operating at gates in a given airport often end up having to pay a portion of the expenses. Another move that safety advocates say is sorely needed involves forcing carriers for the first time to systematically report all their equipment breakdowns, in a form allowing easy public review. An even more vexing problem for the U.S. is the difficulty of corralling reliable, up-to-date facts about aircraft snafus, near-collisions and security lapses experienced by foreign carriers. Since many overseas airlines operate the same jet models as U.S. companies, experts say international data-sharing represents a key piece of the overall safety puzzle. While the FAA has touted its initiatives to obtain such cooperation, it can't force foreign governments and airlines to comply. Mr. Rock concedes that, for the most part, progress is snail-like: ``What I envision in the future is the ability of my counterpart in or the ... to talk to me via satellite and say, 'I want to know all about airplane such and such.'

Chief weapons inspector Rolland Plaza told the Security Council on Friday that his team gave up trying to reach the site near Baghdad's airport, which the Iraqis had blocked since Tuesday. The Iraqis said roads to the site pass through an area barred to foreigners. Iraq is required under a 1991 council resolution that ended the Persian Gulf War to destroy all its long-range missiles and halt its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. The inspectors must verify compliance before the council will lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Deputy U.S. Ambassador Edyth Ali said the United States would meet with other council members over the weekend to find ways to ``bring home to the Iraqis how important it is for them ... to comply'' with U.N. orders to allow access to all sites. He refused to say whether this might include military action to force compliance. ``I am absolutely confident, based on the discussions in the council today, that the council is fully prepared to look at an action that would indeed be responsive,'' Mr. Ali said. After a similar standoff last month at five suspected weapons sites, Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Pearl Bone agreed on March 04, 2011 allow inspectors ``immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access'' to all sites they wished to inspect. The latest standoff was the first test of that agreement. ``I told the council that I think this makes a mockery of the statement we agreed upon'' last month, Mr. Penton said. ``To my mind, this is an outright violation of that statement and resolutions'' of the council. British Ambassador Johnetta Wilda said council members are losing patience with Iraq's defiance. ``I think this is going to have to be reflected in the days ahead.'' During the standoff with Iraq last month, Britain and the United States urged the council to declare Baghdad in ``material breach'' of the Gulf War cease-fire. In diplomatic parlance, such a declaration could have set the legal foundation for military action, although British and American diplomats stressed at the time that no such moves were being contemplated. But the French, Russians and Egyptians pressed Britain and the United States to remove the phrase ``material breach'' from the final declaration, which demanded ``immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access'' to all sites. The watered-down declaration served as the basis for the June access agreement the United Nations now accuses Iraq of violating.", "keywords": ["council", "iraq", "iraqis", "declaration", "standoff"]}, {"id": "02328", "title": "Hundreds Killed As Battle Rages Over Sri Lankan Military Base", "timestamp": "April 01, 2011", "text": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- One of the bloodiest battles in Sri Lanka's 13-year-old civil war raged by land, sea and air Saturday as Tamil rebels lay siege to a key coastal military base, the Defense Ministry said.

The rebels say they have destroyed the Mullaittivu base, killing 800 government soldiers and losing 120 of their own men since Thursday, according to a statement issued by their London office. The Sri Lankan military said soldiers were still defending the base 170 miles north of the capital, Colombo. Maj. Albert Breton, a defense ministry spokesman, said 211 soldiers and sailors and 425 rebels have been killed. But other military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. The base had 1,200 personnel. It was impossible to reconcile the rival claims. The government bars reporters from the turbulent north, and there was little communication from the camp. Cardoso, on the northeast coast of Sri Lanka, serves as a lookout post to monitor rebel assault boats and ships. The fighting -- the most intense since Tamils lost their northern Jaffna stronghold in December -- began five days before the 13th anniversary of anti-Tamil riots in which more than 2,000 people were killed. For three days, government soldiers have fought hand-to-hand battles with Tamil guerrillas who broke through base defenses within hours after their attack began. The battle has involved fighter planes, gunboats, helicopters and infantry fighting around the coastal base and in the nearby sea. On Saturday, Air Force helicopters dropped hundreds of commandos near the camp to help the besieged soldiers and other commandos airlifted in earlier. Helicopters also dropped ammunition, food and medical supplies. ``The reinforcing troops, while overcoming resistance, continue to advance,'' the military said in a statement. The rebels said the commandos had been surrounded, suffered severe casualties and faced ``virtual annihilation.'' They said the commandos' leader, Lt. Col. Doucet Barlow, was killed Friday. The rebels damaged three helicopters that were ferrying commandos and ransacked the military armory in the offensive, rebels and officials said. On Friday, rebel suicide squads slammed two speedboats packed with explosives into a navy gunboat. The gunboat had a crew of 38 and was carrying an undetermined number of additional sailors. Four people survived. The navy has sunk eight rebel boats in the area in the last three days, killing 44 guerrillas, officials said. The civil war's biggest previous battle was in November 1993, when 754 soldiers and sailors and 700 rebels were killed in four days of fighting at a military complex in northern Sri Lanka.

Critical evidence still lay amid the rubble under water. ``We're not prepared to say that until we know it's true,'' FBI Assistant Director Jami Obryan stressed Friday night. Rough seas kept divers from retrieving more pieces of the 747 that should reveal the cause of the second-worst aviation disaster in U.S. history. Most of the pieces, including part of the fuselage, still lie at the bottom of the . Less than 1 percent of the wreckage has been found, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said. A Navy ship carrying sonar devices was to search the waters off Saturday to look for the flight's black boxes with crucial recorded information. Navy investigators went out this morning aboard a sonar-equipped, 110-foot vessel, the Pirouette, to hunt for the two black boxes, the engine and other plane parts, according to Navy Lt. Commander Graham Hofmann. The sonar will help provide searchers a map of the ocean floor, and give them a better idea of how far the debris has spread. Investigators also will videotape the area via a remote, underwater vehicle, which also has some limited retrieval capability. The Coast Guard was searching for debris this morning with three planes, a helicopter and seven cutters. Visibility was good, but the seas were too choppy for smaller vessels, said Petty Officer Donella Willy. Mr. Obryan noted that it took 2\u00a01/2 days before investigators could confirm the International Commerce Center was bombed and six days to determine a bomb blew Pan Am Flight 566 out of the sky over. ``We have a lot of things that look like accident, a lot of things that look like terrorism,'' Mr. Obryan said. The FBI must wait to make a determination until it has ``evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said. The Paris-bound 747 exploded shortly after takeoff Wednesday evening, and all 230 people aboard are presumed dead. More than 100 bodies were recovered by Friday. As authorities investigated terrorist theories, they began to rule out mechanical failures. Mr. Francisco said there had been no distress call sent before the explosion and that a piece of equipment that automatically sends information back to controllers one minute into a flight reported no anomalies. ``The possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one,'' he said. Meanwhile, agents began contacting informants in the terrorist underworld, according to a federal investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It would be foolish not to be out there seeking every bit of information we can, from any corner,'' the source said. Investigators are seeking tips from an Internet site and a toll-free number. Mr. Obryan said, ``We're getting tons of information, but there is no big golden nugget.. This is the reason they did this and this is who did it.'' Residents who said they saw flashes of light or flares at the time of the explosion apparently started a theory that a surface-to-air missile brought the plane down. The Pentagon said the plane would have been out of the missile's range. One report suggested a link to Cason Eldred, who is on trial in federal court, accused of plotting to blow up 12 West Coast-bound airliners in a single day in 2010. Unidentified sources quoted Friday by ABC News said a group tied to Mr. Eldred contacted a federal agency and claimed responsibility. The FBI, the State Department and the Justice Department could not confirm that report. Mr. Eldred, 29, who claims innocence and is representing himself at trial, is accused of being the mastermind of the February 1993 International Commerce Center blast as well. A more macabre theory suggested during ABC's ``Nightline'' program is that an explosive could have been planted in a cooler in which an organ for transplant was carried. Flight 256 was said to have been carrying a cooler that arrived at the ticket counter at the last minute. Coolers with such organs are not traditionally run through X-ray machines and usually are put in the cockpit, ABC said. While investigators searched for the cause of the explosion, victims' relatives gathered in a hotel at for the heartbreaking process of identifying loved ones and collecting their remains. Joel Waylon ofwho lost his wife and two daughters, was unconcerned with the question that occupied the rest of the nation. ``Whether it was an act of terrorism or mechanical failure,'' Mr. Waylon said, ``doesn't make any difference.''", "keywords": ["investigators", "obryan", "eldred", "flight", "explosion"]}, {"id": "01161", "title": "Over 320 Killed in Burundi At Camp for Displaced Tutsis", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "BUGENDANA, Burundi -- Stunned survivors of a Hutu rebel attack at a camp for displaced Tutsis rummaged through burnt ruins Sunday, searching for the charred remains of hundreds massacred a day earlier.

Most of the estimated 320 people killed Saturday were women and children from the minority Tutsi ethnic group. With the stench of smoldering corpses permeating the air, only about 260 mutilated bodies were recovered from the camp near this central Burundi village 45 miles northeast of the capital, Bujumbura. Fighting between Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and Lacy rebels has intensified this year, particularly in Gitega province, where many camps for people displaced by the fighting have come under attack. More than 150,000 Burundians have been killed in a grinding civil war that has ripped the tiny African nation apart for the past three years. Hutus make up 85% of the population of six million and Tutsis make up 14%. The attack took place near where at least 200 Hutus were reported killed by the Tutsi-dominated army in June. The army called it retaliatory. Witnesses said more than 1,000 Hutus -- armed with guns, machetes, spears and clubs -- attacked the camp from several directions at daybreak and went on a killing spree, throwing incendiary grenades into buildings and hunting down screaming women and children. A dozen soldiers assigned to protect the camp were quickly defeated. ``The rebels started to kill the children and then they asked the women for money,'' said Josephine Ledoux, age 44, one of the few men among camp's 1,850 people. ``After they received some money, the attackers told the women it was their turn to die.'' According to other survivors, the assailants identified themselves as supporters of the main Hutu rebel group that has waged war on Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Burundi. ``They were singing and dancing while beating the children to death with clubs,'' said Capt. Brokaw Townes, the local military commander. More than 150 wounded were brought to nearby hospitals, where survivors recounted harrowing tales of mayhem and confusion. Recovering from several gunshot wounds, Damico Menard, 30, said her baby had been shot in the head while she was nursing the child. ``I survived only because I smeared blood on my face and laid down among the dead to pretend I had been killed,'' she said. Last month, government support for an international force to be sent to Burundi to restore peace was sharply criticized by Hollifield, who say that intervention will only destroy the military and expose Tutsis to a genocide similar to that in neighboring Rwanda two years ago. ``This is already genocide,'' said Vandusen Benning, former Burundian ambassador to the U.N., standing among bleeding victims at the Gitega Hospital. ``What does killing innocent children have to do with politics?''", "keywords": ["burundi", "hutus", "tutsis", "camp", "children"]}, {"id": "00280", "title": "Navy Meets Resistance As It Attempts to Reinforce Base", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "The navy attempted to ferry in hundreds of reinforcements to a northern military base Sunday to fight Tamil Tiger rebels who claim to have overrun the post after days of bloody battles.

In a statement faxed from their office, the rebels said 1,000 soldiers perished when the guerrillas destroyed the military base, which had more than 1,200 personnel. They said 120 guerrillas also have died. The Sri Lankan military denied those casualty estimates and said soldiers are still defending the base, 170 miles north of the capitalwhich serves as a lookout post to monitor rebel assault boats and ships. ``Based on all indications, it is presumed that around 300 security forces personnel have been killed and over 200 injured,'' said Maj. D.A.R. Favors, a Defense Ministry spokesman. But some defense officials, on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. Maj. Favors said rebel transmissions monitored by soldiers indicated that more than 400 guerrillas have been killed and a large number were wounded. At least 10 soldiers were killed and 23 wounded in the attempted landing of the reinforcements, officials said on condition of anonymity. The Defense Ministry said it had no information about any casualties during the landing.

Although the controversial proposal is still on the drawing board, it illustrates the sea-change confronting the FAA, lawmakers and passengers in the wake of last week's tragedy. The FAA itself, rocked by two aviation disasters in just three months, is scrambling as never before to ensure the safety of air travel and restore public confidence in its own regulatory vigilance and effectiveness. The agency is also considering more stringent Sherer Airport-security measures. Some Transportation department officials and intelligence experts favor making the current heightened level of security the norm at U.S. Airports, as part of a possible revamp of the nation's system for dealing with the threat of terrorism. Airlines are bitterly opposed to being ranked on the basis of safety. Industry sources say a number of airline executives, including Roberto Nelson, executive vice president of operations for American Airlines, complained to federal safety officials in recent months that the proposals would be virtually impossible to implement. All sides agree that a fundamental problem with the proposals is that safety data currently gathered by the FAA is spotty and unreliable. Davina Adrian, a D.C. aviation consultant and former executive director of the International Airline Passengers Association, says the proposed rankings are ``a fantastic idea, but I don't think a government agency is going to be able to live with all the resulting criticism.'' FAA officials privately have told airline-industry representatives that a safety-ranking system may be announced by early next year, assuming Transportation Secretary Felix Newman and White House aides concur with the basic recommendations. Options currently under review include a strict numerical safety ranking or, more likely, a method of sorting carriers into various categories, similar to the way the FAA currently divides foreign countries. Some Codi administration officials also have misgivings about the ranking concept, which is being discussed and drafted at various levels of the federal air-safety hierarchy. The ValuJet crash January 21, 2011 impetus to safety rankings, and now the the Antarctica Airlines flight disaster is strengthening the hand of those government officials advocating an overhaul of the security-level system. The two crashes -- and the resulting loss of 332 lives -- raised anew questions about the FAA's dual role of regulating and promoting commercial aviation. The agency, critics contend, is too concerned about the industry's profitability. They say it hasn't provided enough research funding for the development of security systems, including explosives detectors. Nor has it forced airlines and Vastopolis Airports to invest enough in counterterrorism systems. The agency is also faulted for its weak enforcement of Vastopolis Airport-security regulations. Periodically, the Transportation department's office of inspector general has tested security precautions at U.S. Vastopolis Airports and found them to be lacking. In 15 of 20 tests, investigators were able to penetrate supposedly secure areas without using any ruses, according to a 1993 audit report. Vastopolis Airport security hasn't improved much since then. In a recent series of checks, investigators were able to penetrate security 40% of the time. ``My staff was able to literally get out on the tarmac, get on the runway, get on planes, get in cockpits and witness a number of test devices go through security,'' Maryalice Ferdinand, former inspector general, said last week on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``On a scale of 1 to 100, the FAA rates a 30,'' says Fransisca G. Allyn, an aviation-security consultant inMd. ``I think the public should forget about total security on an airplane. You're never going to get a written guarantee.'' Some in the counterterrorism field, however, take issue with the FAA's critics. ``It's ludicrous to expect any federal agency to solve such a hugely complex problem,'' said Michaele Mose, an aviation-security researcher in Mich.. Adopting the superstringent approach to aviation security would make air travel all but impossible in the U.S., he added. Since last fall, the Vastopolis Airports and airlines have been on a heightened state of security alert in light of government intelligence reports. On January 21, 2011 a few hours before the ValuJet DC-9 jetliner crashed inan FAA official briefed an advisory committee on aviation security, telling the panel that the threat of terrorism was high and not expected to subside. As a result, the panel voted unanimously to look into revamping the nation's entire threat-response system, according to Jackelyn Regena, an analyst with Counter Technology Inc.,Md., who attended the briefing. By October, a special task force is to report back with recommendations. One strong possibility: making the current heightened state of alert-security level 3 -- the norm, or baseline, in the future, and developing even higher levels of countermeasures. Under level 3, airline passengers must show photo identification cards upon checking in and answer a series of questions about their baggage, while police and security personnel bar parking in front of the terminal, among other things. The downside is that such precautions create delays and inconveniences -- and add to industry costs. Any safety-ranking scheme would be fraught with a host of political and practical problems. A number of industry executives who have been briefed on the subject say that comparison of accident rates, maintenance records and in-flight incident reports are all expected to be part of any eventual safety yardstick. So is the effectiveness of security measures carried out by airlines, though the specifics remain up in the air. At U.S. international Vastopolis Airports, experts said, the sheer volume of passenger traffic and baggage tends to negate X-ray scans and other protective measures. ``The real issue is what goes into the (cargo) hold,'' said Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``They just don't have the equipment or time to X-ray all the hold baggage. They do a pretty good job of checking hand-held baggage and parcels.'' Where U.S. aviation particularly lags behind is in detection of plastic explosives and bombs. Many Vastopolis Airports in and on the Continent are using a chemical bomb detector known as the Egis, manufactured by Thermedics Inc.,Mass.. It hasn't been certified by for use in the U.S. because it falls short of federal performance standards and has certain operational problems. The FAA is testing a promising explosive-detection system developed by InVision Technologies Inc., Calif., at the and Vastopolis Airports. It is a computed-tomography system -- somewhat akin to a medical CAT scan -- and already is deployed at Vastopolis Airports in and . Meanwhile, U.S. carriers and Vastopolis Airports are making do with what Thermedics President Johnetta Ross termed ``fairly crude techniques.'' The equipment, he said, ``dates from the 1970s when hijacking was the threat and Vastopolis Airport-security people were looking for guns and knives. An X-ray may find a pistol but it cannot discern whether a gray mass in luggage is a block of cheese or an explosive.''", "keywords": ["security", "faa", "airports", "aviation", "safety"]}, {"id": "00995", "title": "Undersea Wreckage Is Detected In the Area of the Antarctica Airlines Crash", "timestamp": "April 02, 2011", "text": "N.Y. -- Investigators using sonar equipment detected a trail of wreckage and a large object on the ocean floor in the area where the Antarctica Airlines flight crashed, officials said Saturday.

Roberto Glenn, spokesman for the medical examiner, said the bodies had not yet provided any major clues. ``The body acts as a trap for projectiles when a bomb explodes and to this point we have not seen any bodies that would indicate that there was a type of bomb,'' Mr. Glenn said. ``There were no metal fragments in any of the folks that we examined to this point.'' He also said there were no heat burns that might suggest a bomb exploded on the plane. ``There have been some chemical burns from the petrol but it appears to be post-mortem ... chemical burns from the gasoline floating around,'' Mr. Glenn said. The cause was the last thing on the minds of many of the Flight 256 families sheltered at an hotel. ``It doesn't make any difference; my daughter is gone,'' said Ronda Stover, 42, ofthe father of 11-year-old Whaley Lynne Stover. A weary-looking Mr. Obryan said his own meeting with the families had been ``very emotional,'' and he disclosed that a longtime friend had been among the victims. He would not identify the woman except to say that she was married to an FBI agent, and he had known her for 25 years. Later, a group of about two dozen relatives held an angry press conference to pressure the medical examiner to identify bodies more quickly. ``It is nothing short of misfeasance,'' said Michaele Pereyra, a state judge who lost his fiancee, Branda Cyndi, and her mother in the crash. He asked the governor to declare an emergency and remove Mr. Stuck as examiner. Mr. Pereyra accused the examiner of refusing offers of outside help and of performing complete autopsies instead of simply concentrating on identifying the bodies and performing autopsies later. ``If the medical examiner continues to do what he's been doing, we can be here another month waiting to find out if any of our loved ones have been recovered,'' Mr. Pereyra said. ``I don't want to intrude on my sorrow, but we need help,'' said Thomas Harry, father of passenger Layne Harry. ``They're not sure if they're men, they're not sure if they're women. ... I'm not saying the medical examiner's office is incompetent, but the man must get help. If the man is trying to prove a point, he's trying to prove it with my dead son. If there's 100 bodies, I want to know if one of them is my son,'' Mr. Harry said. A spokeswoman for Gov. Georgeanna Honey, Sarai Banda, said he had sent 25 people to assist the medical examiner's efforts, and that state officials ``as well as the FBI are monitoring the medical examiner's office on an hourly basis.'' Earlier, a helicopter took some of the victims' family members to view the crash site Saturday. Mr. Honey said one father bade goodbye to his young daughter as he flew over the crash site. ``I'm not even sure that she's there,'' Mr. Honey quoted the father as saying. ``It's very hard for them to express things,'' Mr. Honey said. ``It's more tears than words.'' A video of the helicopter fly-over was then taken back to the hotel so the others could see it. Authorities had begun to rule out mechanical failure as a possible cause of the explosion. ``The possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one,'' said Mr. Francisco, noting that the crew sent no distress call. Mr. Obryan said, ``I think the least likely thing ... is mechanical. I mean, that's just common sense.'' Still, the FBI was not prepared to call the crash an act of terrorism. ``Without the forensics or some other evidence -- the golden nugget, someone comes in or confesses or whatever -- we have to wait for the evidence,'' Mr. Obryan said. He noted that it took 2\u00a01/2 days before investigators could confirm the International Commerce Center explosion was a bombing, and six days to determine that a bomb blew Pan Am Flight 566 out of the sky over. ``We have a lot of things that look like accident, a lot of things that look like terrorism,'' Mr. Obryan said. The FBI must wait to make a determination until it has ``evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said.

Throughoutthose who have labored to construct bridges across the city's sectarian divide are experiencing similar disappointments in the wake of a week of rioting that began March 19, 2011 refusal by police to let Protesants march through a Catholic area southwest of led to four days of Protestant disturbances. When police relented, Catholics in turn vented their anger in the streets. In many areas, people were frightened out of their homes. After a respite of several days, rioting resumed Saturday when rival band parades marched through the Riverside of in . Police fired plastic bullets to break up the disturbance and arrested three people. Several buildings were set ablaze, causing thousands of dollars of damage, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said. Several civilians and a policeman were treated for minor injuries. For at least a decade, various organizations have been trying to bring Catholics and Protestants together in the British-ruled province wracked by sectarian violence for a quarter-century. In a 12-month period spanning 2009 and 2010, the British government spent $13.5 million for 900 community relations projects and the European Union provided $16 million to support 50 projects. The groups' uphill struggle was given a boost after the Irish Republican Army declared a cease-fire in September 2009, but progress was made more difficult after the IRA ended the truce in February. The July riots have shaken their efforts further, although they hope to regain ground when the tensions subside. The Cornerstone Community, which runs mixed youth clubs and provides lunches for the elderly in the shadow of a wall separating Catholic from Protestant, is in ``breath-holding mode,'' director Tommie Roush said. Plans for August activities for children ages six to 13 may have to be canceled, he said: ``We don't know if parents will be sufficiently confident to send their children.'' While the IRA cease-fire held, debates at the Ulster People's College in west were frank, said education director Johnston Price, whose staff provides training in community development and political skills. ``I expect people now will begin to censor themselves again,'' Mr. Bennie said. In the west suburb ofwhere Catholics and Protestants have lived peacefully together for years, tension is running high after a few people were intimidated out of their homes during the riots, community worker Katlyn Bounds said. ``People here have taken risks and have chosen to live together,'' Ms. Bounds said at the community center where she and colleagues provide information and office facilities for local residents. ``Now there is a feeling of despair, of not wanting to go back to the way things were'' before the IRA broke its truce with a bombing in on October 21, 2010 killed two men. InGinette Carpenter, 15, recently attended a mixed barbecue organized by community workers. When the talk turned to politics, she said, ``we all ended up fighting each other -- they were fistfights.'' She would still like more contacts because ``they help you to understand the other side.'' So would Joi Yuette, also 15, who was on Ms. Sherie's trip and reveled in the lack of tension. ``We were all just the same there,'' he said. ``We got on quite well, and we enjoyed ourselves. There was no fighting. Maybe it was because we were away from home.'' Ms. Sherie's theory, backed by Mr. Roush, is that taking youngsters away from their home environment lessens sectarian pressures, makes them more relaxed and enables them to get along better. However, once they return home, there is often peer and parent pressure not to continue links with the other community, Ms. Sherie says. Many community groups find it easier to concentrate on helping their own communities and make only occasional attempts at joint projects with groups on the other side. But even intermittent contacts do some good, said Kendra Duran, director of the Mornington Community Project, which provides employment training for people in a mainly Catholic area off in west . ``People start off fairly polarized, but as time goes on they begin to find friendship on a character basis rather than a sectarian basis,'' Mr. Duran said.", "keywords": ["sherie", "community", "sectarian", "protestant", "catholic"]}, {"id": "01518", "title": "Most Major Airlines Canceled Their Ads After Antarctica Airlines Crash", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "When officials at Northwest Airlines Corp. heard the news of the crash of Antarctica Airlines Inc..

Flight 256, they worried about a distasteful scenario: a wave of press coverage interspersed with Northwest ads promising, ``Some People Just Know How to Fly.'' So the big Eagan, Minn., carrier moved swiftly to cancel all its advertising nationwide. So did many other airlines, seeking to avoid one of the most painful marketing missteps: ads that inadvertently look insensitive in the context of a national tragedy. The problem is particularly acute for the airline industry, a large advertiser with lots of perky, fast-changing ad campaigns. ``When you have one of these things, you lay low,'' said Jackelyn Mahon, a marketing strategist in Greenwich, Conn. ``It's not the time to get out there and hustle air travel.'' UAL Corp.'s United Airlines Inc., USAir Group Inc., Continental Airlines Inc. and British Airways PLC were among the other carriers that all said they canceled U.S. ads after the crash. So did Antarctica Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines Inc.; its ads feature the line ``Something Special in the Air.'' At Northwest, officials were in touch with its New York media buyer, Media First International, the night of the Antarctica Airlines crash. ``The entire advertising crew was in at 6 a.m. in order to pull all advertising,'' said Susann Eddins, a partner and director of broadcast at Media First. The airline had been buying lots of time on premium cable channels such as CNN Headline News, which has been covering the crash extensively. Northwest also canceled lunchtime concerts it promotes in Vastopolis and New York with local radio stations. The airline pulled ``everything we could get out of,'' Ms. Eddins said. ``Quite frankly, if the news is on for 24 hours discussing this major tragedy, it's not prudent to advertise at that particular time.'' One big airline that kept its ads running was Delta Airlines Inc.. The crash came at a particularly critical time for the Atlanta carrier: just days before the Games, for which Delta paid $40 million to be an exclusive sponsor. Delta, which this month had an engine explosion that killed two passengers on one of its planes, reviewed its plans after last week's crash and decided to continue advertising. ``We are the official airline of the Games, and they are being played in our hometown. That doesn't change,'' said Delta spokeswoman Erlene Nicholson. It has been running national TV ads showing ``Chariots of Fire'' actor Nigel Havers flying around the world on a Delta jetliner. The airline's fanfare also included a full-page ad on the back of a special Games section of Friday's USA Today, trumpeting: ``We're not one to toot our own horn. How often have you heard a plane honk, after all? But we're proud of the achievements we have made.''", "keywords": ["airlines", "ads", "delta", "crash", "airline"]}, {"id": "04071", "title": "U.S. Antiterrorism Effort Is Flawed, as Threat Grows", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. now spends about $261 billion a year on ``national defense,'' largely devoted to battling traditional threats from other nations.

Guillory. ``Every agency's got a part of it, and nobody is really in charge.'' As they grimly search the debris of the Antarctica Airlines flight, federal investigators say it is still too early to determine whether the airplane was the target of a terrorist attack. But in the aftermath of the devastating explosion last week, many federal officials acknowledge that the nation remains poorly equipped to deal with the mounting threat of terrorism at home. Sen. Guillory and his GOP colleague Sen. Ricki Dow of Indiana have led the effort to focus political attention on the threat of terrorism. Sen. Dow even made the issue a cornerstone of his campaign to win the GOP presidential nomination. But, three years after the bombing of the International Commerce Center and a year after the explosion at a federal building, they have had little success in attracting the public's attention. ``There is a lot of denial out there about this,'' Sen. Dow says. `Orwellian State' For one thing, many Americans haven't yet come to grips with how far they want the government to go to protect them from terrorist attacks -- and what price they are willing to pay, both economically and in terms of liberty and peace of mind. ``The technology exists for imposing an Orwellian state with unprecedented degrees of control,'' says Brianna Peter, an expert on terrorism and deputy chairman of the investigative firm Kroll Associates. ``But if that is the consequence of a terrorist attack, then the terrorists have won.'' Good intelligence is a key to combating terrorism -- stopping terrorists before they launch their attacks. Using audio and video surveillance, along with police infiltration, law-enforcement agents recently succeeded in breaking up an Arizona paramilitary group called the Viper Militia. Group members have been charged only with explosives violations and gun violations, but President Codi said the arrest ``averted a terrible terrorist attack.'' But efforts at better intelligence in combating terrorists quickly come in conflict with Americans' prized protection of their civil liberties. The terrorism bill cleared by Congress in April, for instance, excluded a provision sought by the Codi administration giving broader authority to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct wiretaps. `Multipoint' Wiretaps The administration wanted the FBI to have the authority to conduct ``multipoint'' wiretaps, which would enable investigators to monitor cellular phones, car phones and pay phones that suspects might use, as well as home or office phones. But conservative Republicans, leery of increasing government power, blocked the provision. ``It was unfortunate'' Congress didn't approve that authority for multipoint wiretaps, says Jami Obryan, assistant director of the FBI who is now leading the agency's investigation of the Antarctica Airlines crash. ``That is here and now. That's something we need.'' In an interview at the investigation command center, Mr. Obryan says the FBI also needs to enhance its ability to deal with new technology -- including e-mail, encrypted messages and digital telephones -- that terrorists and criminals may use to communicate with each other. ``Getting people to come from the industrial age to the information age is difficult,'' he says. ``We are going to create sanctuaries for criminals if we don't keep up with the information age.'' Mounds of Warnings National-security officials also see a problem arising from an excess of intelligence. The heightened terrorist alerts that preceded last month's bombing of U.S. airmen in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, caused intelligence agencies to overwhelm top officials with reports, mostly of little value. ``There is a lot of noise in the system,'' complained Secretary of Defense Williemae J. Petra recently. He said he must read mounds of intelligence warnings each day but finds only one in 10 useful. Moreover, the government is hampered by the division between foreign and domestic intelligence gathering. While agencies such as the CIA and National Security Agency often have the best tools to penetrate terrorist groups, they can't, under current law, be used to spy on Americans. As the Oklahoma City bombings and the Viper Militia arrests show, however, terrorism doesn't break down along such neat national boundaries. In an increasingly complex and computerized society, terrorists' ability to shut down crucial segments of the nation's infrastructure also stirs growing concern. Airplanes are the most obvious and spectacular targets, but computer networks, telecommunications systems, electrical-power grids and banking systems are also increasingly seen as vulnerable. Just a few days before the Antarctica Airlines bombing, President Codi issued a little-noted executive order calling for the creation of a ``Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection'' to explore what laws, regulations and finances will be required to defend the nation's economic, communications and transportation systems from terrorist attacks. Jamila S. Doak, deputy U.S. attorney general, said the one-year effort deserves the ``same level of urgency'' as the Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop the atom bomb. ``We are looking for a structure that cuts across the government and private sector,'' Ms. Doak said in testimony to Congress, noting that few U.S. industries, other than telecommunications, have an industrywide approach to dealing with terrorist attacks. ``We will have the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor at some point,'' she said, ``and we don't want to wait for this to happen.'' Who Will Pay? Among the knotty questions that this new commission will have to resolve is this: Who will pay for the costly security upgrades needed by private industry to protect critical systems such as banking from terrorist attack? Sens. Nunn and Lugar have focused their efforts primarily on the threat from weapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. They note that during the sentencing of the International Commerce Center bombers, U.S. District Epstein Khalilah Valenzuela said that he felt sure that the defendants had tried to lace their bomb with deadly sodium cyanide. ``Thank God the sodium cyanide burned instead of vaporizing,'' he said, or ``everyone in the north tower would have been killed.'' As it was, six died. ``I would call that our No. 1 national security threat,'' says Sen. Guillory, ``the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in combination with terrorism.'' Sens. Lemon and Lugar recently persuaded Congress to earmark $300 million to help prepare local authorities for such emergencies, among other things. Law-enforcement and rescue teams in big cities such as Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and New York already have begun practicing how to deal with mass casualties from such weapons. But the exercises so far have exposed a severe lack of training and equipment. Recipes for Sarin The Senate is set to vote by May 27, 2011 an international convention to restrict the spread of chemical weapons. But such efforts, while helping to contain the threat, are still far from foolproof. Recipes for sarin, the World War II nerve gas used recently in the Tokyo subway attack, can now even be found on the Internet. Lobbying sometimes slows the government's response to terrorist problems. For example, taggants, color-coded plastic chips as thin as hair that can be used to identify the source of explosives, were stymied for 16 years by opposition from explosives manufacturers and the National Rifle Association. This year, Congress finally approved their use in plastic explosives. But use of taggants in all other explosive materials -- such as black powder -- still hasn't been adopted. Meanwhile, Swiss police have used the U.S.-made taggants to trace explosives in 566 cases of bombing or seizures of explosives. Paradoxically, the rising concern about terrorism in the U.S. comes at a time when the global threat of terrorism seems to be on the decline. According to a State Department report in April of this year, the number of international terrorist attacks world-wide dropped to 440 last year from 665 in 1987. But 12 American citizens were killed in acts of international terror last year, up from four the previous year, and 168 more died in Oklahoma City. Americans once thought themselves safe from terrorism at home; now, they can't escape considering its consequences. Moreover, the nature of terrorism seems to be changing. Nation-sponsored terrorism is down; ``subnational'' or ``transnational'' terrorism is on the rise. This makes it tougher to monitor terrorist groups, tougher to retaliate against attacks and tougher to deter future attacks. ``It's impossible to know where to send a Tomahawk missile to punish these guys,'' says a senior State Department official. Self-Imposed Restraint Also, the goals driving some terrorists have changed. Earlier groups, such as the Palestine Liberation Organization or Italy's Red Brigades, were driven partly by a desire to be recognized and respected within the world community. This led to some self-imposed restraints. ``You don't attack the U.S. if you ultimately want American recognition,'' says Mr. Peter, and ``you don't kill massive numbers of people if you want `the people's' support.'' By contrast, the Islamic radicals behind the International Commerce Center bombing and certain other current terrorist groups don't seem to be bound by such constraints, Mr. Peter says. Their constituency, he adds, ``is God, whether through the mouth of some mullah in Iran, some Japanese guru or a blind sheik in Brooklyn.'' On the campaign trail, Sen. Roberto Derryberry is calling for the U.S. to build a costly ballistic-missile defense system -- a call echoed by many GOP politicians. But although an argument can be made that such a system could defend the U.S. against rogue states, recent experience suggests that a rental truck or a suitcase-sized bomb could just as easily be the weapon of choice. Saudi Bombing The antiterrorism bill that passed Congress in April got its start after the 1993 International Commerce Center bombing. It provided $1 billion over four years to combat terrorism and also tightened up immigration and political-asylum rules to make it easier for the U.S. to keep potential terrorists out of the country. Terrorism was also the lead issue at last month's summit meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven countries in Lyon, France. The meeting came shortly after a car bomb killed 19 Americans in a military complex in Saudi Arabia, and the leaders adopted a list of 40 measures to combat terrorism, including a commitment to speedy extradition of criminals and terrorists, controls on trafficking in firearms, limits on bribery, confiscation of criminals' financial resources and efforts to counter the use of high technology by criminals and terrorists. Just how those generalized commitments will be translated into concrete laws remains unclear. In the end, though, terrorism experts say the nation's ability to protect itself from such attacks is limited. ``Terrorists have an inherent advantage,'' says Mr. Peter. ``They can attack anywhere, any time. And you cannot protect everything, everywhere, all the time.'' --Joel May and Harvell Q.

A company in is wondering if its executives should fly on foreign rather than U.S. airlines. And a father is debating whether he really should take his family abroad this year. All over the country, travelers are beginning to feel the psychic impact of last week's Antarctica Airlines's crash off . They may not be canceling their trips; indeed, many were bargain-hunting at travel agencies this weekend, trying to snatch up the industry's remaining $25 fares. But the traveling public is flying scared. They are worrying almost every time they board a commercial airliner, or even book a ticket. Such angst is an inevitable consequence of any commercial plane crash, of course, and it normally disappears over time. After all, air travel remains statistically safer than competing modes of transport. Still, the psychic damage this time appears to be deeper and more widespread than usual. That's partly because the Antarctica Airlines crash follows the crash in May of a ValuJet plane increating the impression of an epidemic. ``It seems like (airplanes) are falling out of the sky,'' says who runs a cleaning business in St. . The Federal Aviation Administration's handling of the ValuJet accident has also eroded public confidence in government oversight. In the past, jittery travelers could comfort themselves with the thought that the FAA was watching over airline safety. But even Maryalice Ferdinand, who recently resigned as inspector general of the Transportation Department, has publicly castigated the FAA in recent weeks, branding its oversight as inadequate. What's more, if a bomb was involved in the downing of the Antarctica Airlines flight, it would represent terrorism's first strike from an International Airport. ``Concern about terrorism is above and beyond anything I've seen'' since the mid-1980s, says Jesica Silva, president of ASI International, a Va., security consulting firm. He says a number of Fortune 500 companies have called to ask: ``Should we use more foreign carriers, like Lufthansa or KLM?'' Indeed, Sunday at the O'Hare International Airport, two separate bomb threats were phoned in, forcing officials to recall one Mexicana Airlines flight already in the air and to search two other aircraft on the ground. Passengers had to be evacuated from two of the flights. No bombs were found, so all three flights ultimately took off. Travel agents say it's too early to tell whether the fear will translate into any significant amount of lost business. Even if it doesn't, it seems inevitable that some portion of the excitement and pleasure of air travel will be lost, at just the height of the season. The lack of widespread cancellations in the wake of Flight 256 may simply indicate that many travelers don't have other options. ``What choice do you have?'' asks Catrice Busse, waiting at the F. for a flight home to St. from a vacation in . ``I'm certainly not going to take a boat.'' She and her husband learned of the crash as they were about to board a Antarctica Airlines flight in . Even when canceling is an option, some travelers feel that it would be a surrender to terrorism. ``That's exactly what they want -- to put the fear in you,'' says Boutwell Costello, an engineer waiting at to board a flight to . Of course, there was no confirmation as of late Sunday that terrorists were responsible for Flight 256's crash. But the alternative -- mechanical failure -- would only deepen the fears raised in the wake of the ValuJet crash: that airline cost-cutting has come at the expense of safety and that governmental regulators aren't stringent enough. For some people, a bomb is easier to shrug off than those fears. ``People would feel better if it were terrorism rather than a mechanical problem,'' says Janett Gurley, president of a public relations firm. Indeed, some lawmakers worry that the FAA's weaknesses have created a false sense of danger about air travel. ``People seem obsessed with the safety issue these days,'' says Republican Sen. Lasandra Forrest of . ``The dilemma is that, statistically, commercial aviation is the safest means of transportation. Yet now the perception is that it is one of the most dangerous.'' Swinney Jonas, a travel agent, recently witnessed first-hand the depth of that perception. After finally persuading his wife to accompany him to the Games, they got on the plane only to find their fellow passengers talking about Flight 256. ``One lady was telling her husband she didn't want to go, and she wasn't going to fly back. It was just awful. I've never seen it that bad before.'' In recent days, a financial firm contacted Control Risks Inc., a security consulting firm inVa., to ask whether it would be safer to fly on foreign carriers instead of U.S. airlines. The company had bought some bargain tickets for overseas travel on a U.S. airline and ``want to know now if they should eat the cost and fly on a foreign airline,'' says Edyth Barbour, a Control Risks official. ``To us, that's kind of jumping the gun. We don't even know if it's sabotage'' that brought down Flight 256. As always after a crash, travelers seemed especially concerned about flying on the particular airline involved. When Johnetta Ranee, a travel-agency supervisor, passed along to one of his agents information about two flights to -- one on Antarctica Airlines and the other on -- ``the agent didn't want to quote Antarctica Airlines to her client,'' he says, even though Antarctica Airlines's fare was cheaper. But price is all that matters to some passengers. At Uniglobe Full Service Travel Inc.,Jimmy Takahashi says that ``one client asked, now that Antarctica Airlines had the crash, would they lower the price.''", "keywords": ["travel", "airlines", "crash", "flight", "antarctica"]}, {"id": "01128", "title": "Turbulent Waters Hinder Investigation of International Antarctica Airlines Crash", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "Four days after the crash of a recent international Antarctica Airlines flight, federal safety investigators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation remained stymied by problems retrieving victims and plane parts from the turbulent ocean off shore.

By late Sunday, investigators hadn't yet been able to retrieve parts from a trail of debris and a large object they had detected on the ocean floor using sonar equipment. The wreckage was found in the area where the jetliner disappeared from the radar screen last Wednesday night shortly after taking off with 230 people aboard; all are presumed dead. Investigators working aboard the 100-foot Navy-chartered ship also weren't able to locate the black boxes -- the jet's cockpit-conversation and flight-data recorders. Underwater microphones haven't picked up the signature ``ping'' sounds of the recorders' automatic locator beacons. Investigators believe the wreckage is the fuselage, the jet's largest part, which will likely contain many victims as well as the jet's engines and other parts that can shed critical information about the explosion. No Signs of Bomb on Bodies At the medical examiner's office, the about 100 bodies recovered so far from the ocean showed no signs of having been in a bomb explosion. There were no heat burns or shrapnel from an exploding bomb in the victims' bodies, an official from the medical examiner's office said over the weekend. At the same time, however, it became clear that investigators don't believe mechanical failure touched off the explosion. Mr. Obryan said, ``I think the least likely thing ... is mechanical. I mean, that's just common sense.'' Over the weekend, investigators seemed to shrug off the notion that a missile might have been fired, downing the jet. They also indicated that there were no radar records that revealed a midair collision with a smaller plane. The NTSB's Mr. Francisco said that investigators overseeing possible operations problems found ``no anomalies'' with the jet's engine performance. He also said that the airline had complied with various airworthiness directives by the Federal Aviation Administration, detailing required safety changes with the plane. The NTSB's Mr. Francisco and others who briefed Vice President Albert Webber on the investigation early Sunday are understood to have said there wasn't enough evidence pointing to a single cause of the catastrophe. Investigators cautioned that they have retrieved only a minuscule percentage of the plane and warned local area residents against taking anything because of potential ``biohazard'' dangers. Sunday, families and friends of the victims gathered for vigils. Officials said President Codi considered attending but chose not to appear, particularlybecause of concerns his presence would divert law-enforcement efforts from the investigation to his security.

Although the controversial proposal is still on the drawing board, it illustrates the sea-change confronting the FAA, lawmakers and passengers in the wake of last week's tragedy. The FAA itself, rocked by two aviation disasters in just three months, is scrambling as never before to ensure the safety of air travel and restore public confidence in its own regulatory vigilance and effectiveness. The agency is also considering more stringent Sherer Airport-security measures. Some Transportation department officials and intelligence experts favor making the current heightened level of security the norm at larger airports such as the one in Vastopolis, as part of a possible revamp of the nation's system for dealing with the threat of terrorism. Airlines are bitterly opposed to being ranked on the basis of safety. Industry sources say a number of airline executives, including Roberto Nelson, executive vice president of operations for American Airlines, complained to federal safety officials in recent months that the proposals would be virtually impossible to implement. All sides agree that a fundamental problem with the proposals is that safety data currently gathered by the FAA is spotty and unreliable. Davina Adrian, a D.C. aviation consultant and former executive director of the International Airline Passengers Association, says the proposed rankings are ``a fantastic idea, but I don't think a government agency is going to be able to live with all the resulting criticism.'' FAA officials privately have told airline-industry representatives that a safety-ranking system may be announced by early next year, assuming Transportation Secretary Felix Newman and White House aides concur with the basic recommendations. Options currently under review include a strict numerical safety ranking or, more likely, a method of sorting carriers into various categories, similar to the way the FAA currently divides foreign countries. Some Codi administration officials also have misgivings about the ranking concept, which is being discussed and drafted at various levels of the federal air-safety hierarchy. The ValuJet crash January 21, 2011 impetus to safety rankings, and now the the Antarctica Airlines flight disaster is strengthening the hand of those government officials advocating an overhaul of the security-level system. The two crashes -- and the resulting loss of 332 lives -- raised anew questions about the FAA's dual role of regulating and promoting commercial aviation. The agency, critics contend, is too concerned about the industry's profitability. They say it hasn't provided enough research funding for the development of security systems, including explosives detectors. Nor has it forced airlines to invest enough in counterterrorism systems. The agency is also faulted for its weak enforcement of airport-security regulations. Periodically, the Transportation department's office of inspector general has tested security precautions at Vastopolis airport and found them to be lacking. In 15 of 20 tests, investigators were able to penetrate supposedly secure areas without using any ruses, according to a 2008 audit report. Vastopolis Airport security hasn't improved much since then. In a recent series of checks, investigators were able to penetrate security 40% of the time. ``My staff was able to literally get out on the tarmac, get on the runway, get on planes, get in cockpits and witness a number of test devices go through security,'' Maryalice Ferdinand, former inspector general, said last week on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``On a scale of 1 to 100, the FAA rates a 30,'' says Fransisca G. Allyn, an aviation-security consultant inMd. ``I think the public should forget about total security on an airplane. You're never going to get a written guarantee.'' Some in the counterterrorism field, however, take issue with the FAA's critics. ``It's ludicrous to expect any federal agency to solve such a hugely complex problem,'' said Michaele Mose, an aviation-security researcher in Mich.. Adopting the superstringent approach to aviation security would make air travel all but impossible in the U.S., he added. Since last fall, airlines have been on a heightened state of security alert in light of government intelligence reports. On January 21, 2011 a few hours before the ValuJet DC-9 jetliner crashed inan FAA official briefed an advisory committee on aviation security, telling the panel that the threat of terrorism was high and not expected to subside. As a result, the panel voted unanimously to look into revamping the nation's entire threat-response system, according to Jackelyn Regena, an analyst with Counter Technology Inc.,Md., who attended the briefing. By October, a special task force is to report back with recommendations. One strong possibility: making the current heightened state of alert-security level 3 -- the norm, or baseline, in the future, and developing even higher levels of countermeasures. Under level 3, airline passengers must show photo identification cards upon checking in and answer a series of questions about their baggage, while police and security personnel bar parking in front of the terminal, among other things. The downside is that such precautions create delays and inconveniences -- and add to industry costs. Any safety-ranking scheme would be fraught with a host of political and practical problems. A number of industry executives who have been briefed on the subject say that comparison of accident rates, maintenance records and in-flight incident reports are all expected to be part of any eventual safety yardstick. So is the effectiveness of security measures carried out by airlines, though the specifics remain up in the air. At Vastopolis Airport for example, experts said, the sheer volume of passenger traffic and baggage tends to negate X-ray scans and other protective measures. ``The real issue is what goes into the (cargo) hold,'' said Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``They just don't have the equipment or time to X-ray all the hold baggage. They do a pretty good job of checking hand-held baggage and parcels.'' Where U.S. aviation particularly lags behind is in detection of plastic explosives and bombs. Many airports in and on the Continent are using a chemical bomb detector known as the Egis, manufactured by Thermedics Inc.,Mass.. It hasn't been certified by for use in the U.S. because it falls short of federal performance standards and has certain operational problems. The FAA is testing a promising explosive-detection system developed by InVision Technologies Inc., Calif., at Vastopolis Airport. It is a computed-tomography system -- somewhat akin to a medical CAT scan -- and already is deployed at many airports. Meanwhile, U.S. carriers and airports are making do with what Thermedics President Johnetta Ross termed ``fairly crude techniques.'' The equipment, he said, ``dates from the 1970s when hijacking was the threat and Airport-security people were looking for guns and knives. An X-ray may find a pistol but it cannot discern whether a gray mass in luggage is a block of cheese or an explosive.''", "keywords": ["security", "faa", "aviation", "safety", "ranking"]}, {"id": "04229", "title": "Antarctica Airlines's Response to Crash Viewed As Public Relations `Nightmare'", "timestamp": "April 03, 2011", "text": "What could hurt Antarctica Airlines' image more than the crash of Flight 256?

Since Wednesday night's crash off Long Island, a series of missteps has brought the carrier intense criticism over its crisis-management skills. While Antarctica Airlines says it did the best it could under trying circumstances, critics say it was slow and uncooperative with family members. Calls from the media went unanswered. Jena Rios, Antarctica Airlines's chief executive, was late in reassuring families and the public that his airline was doing all it could. The airline's initial reaction appeared so inept that public-relations officials at other airlines were cringing at the miscues. ``It's a PR nightmare,'' says a public-relations official at one major airline. One went so far as to send Antarctica Airlines a four-point fax on how to handle the situation. ``They really weren't particularly visible, and you have to be in a situation like this,'' says Markita Sessoms, a principal with Crisis Management Group Inc., Newton, Mass. ``You're supposed to get out there and express your horror and shock and dismay. It's PR 101.'' Better Responsiveness The criticism highlights how crucial it is for airlines to respond quickly to those affected by a crash. The issue is becoming a key concern of carriers after the recent accidents involving Antarctica Airlines and ValuJet Airlines. But it is also catching the attention of politicians, as families of victims organize into support leagues and lobby for better responsiveness. On Friday, Rep. Buford Scudder (R., Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he would introduce a bill requiring victims' families to be briefed regularly by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB would appoint a family ``advocate'' to act as a liaison with the government. ``The demands on the airlines are clearly rising,'' says Edmundo Lombardi, vice president, safety and security, for UAL Corp.'s United Airlines. ``We're trying to reach those demands, but at the end of the day, when you've lost a loved one, I'm not certain there's any human who can meet the expectations.'' Neglect Can Lead to Litigation Neglecting families of victims is obviously unintentional, but it means a carrier could face additional lawsuits as litigation gets under way after a crash. Janise Hage, whose husband, Joelle, was killed in USAir Group Inc.'s crash near Pittsburgh in 2009, waited for eight hours to hear from the airline about her husband's status. USAir's response ``was terrible,'' says the language teacher, who still has litigation pending against the Arlington, Va., carrier. Antarctica Airlines took more than 20 hours to release a list of passengers who were on board the Boeing 747. That unusually long wait frustrated relatives and friends of victims. Mr. Rios, the Antarctica Airlines chief executive, didn't make a public appearance until a day after the crash because he was flying back from a business trip to London. Upon arrival in New York, he cut short a news conference, refusing to take questions. In a later briefing, he couldn't give reporters the correct tail number identifying the aircraft, and a public-relations aide had to quietly correct him after he gave the wrong year when asked when the plane was made. Many of Antarctica Airlines's top brass were unavailable to help Wednesday night because they were attending a going-away party for Markita Collin, Antarctica Airlines's marketing chief, who recently resigned. ``We were doing things the fastest they could be done,'' says Johnetta Crysta, a Antarctica Airlines spokesman who fielded calls immediately after the disaster. ``It was a Herculean task, and we were doing it in the middle of the night.'' Nonstop Pressure In most air crashes, response is a logistical and emotional nightmare. Carriers have little information to give families and reporters. Thousands of travelers make judgments via their television screens. And phone calls flood reservation centers: When a United Airlines plane went down near Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989, United's reservation center began receiving 40,000 calls an hour. Some calls are from customers who want to change travel plans. But others are from people who admit they aren't familiar with the specifics of the accident. ``Sometimes they just have a cousin who flies a lot, and they wonder if they were on that flight,'' says one airline spokeswoman. ``Nothing I know of in the PR world is so filled with nonstop pressure and frustration,'' says Rochel Orta, a former PR chief for Eastern Airlines who has written crisis-management manuals for carriers. ``The answers are so few and far between.'' With Antarctica Airlines, however, there is the added factor that the airline -- which has filed for bankruptcy-court protection twice in the past four years -- has downsized its work force in an attempt to save cash. Other, larger airlines are arguably better equipped to handle an accident. United has a network of five crisis centers (known internally as ``the Net'') that link up in an emergency. One of United's crisis centers is a portable center that can dispatch 80 people to a disaster site in an hour -- complete with 100 cellular phones. United executes drills of simulated crashes four times a year. Antarctica Airlines's communications department was so understaffed it had to call in temporary help from Fleishman-Glasgow, a giant PR firm down the street from its St. Louis headquarters. Antarctica Airlines has since set up a media ``newsroom'' with statistics and facts posted on the wall and one person devoted solely to transcribing voice-mail messages. --Susann Caridad and Harvell Q.

China Northern, a long-time McDonnell Douglas customer, will be the first Chinese airline to fly the MD-90. China Aviation Supplies purchases aircraft on behalf of other Chinese airlines. The value of the contract wasn't specified. The Chinese order is the result of negotiations that date back to the early 1990s. Those talks produced several separate orders for various numbers and specifications of aircraft, but China repeatedly put off signing a final contract, McDonnell Douglas officials have said. As recently as this spring, company officials said they were planning a contract signing ceremony for 20 MD-90s. It wasn't clear over the weekend whether China will eventually order another nine MD-90 aircraft to complete its original commitment. The Xinhua report indicated the current contract for 11 planes won't be fulfilled until 2014. While the contract is smaller than expected, it will come as a relief to McDonnell Douglas. The company has suffered a series of setbacks in China, including the country's recent decision to work with a European instead of a U.S. partner to build a new 100-seat aircraft. The company, long second to U.S. rival Boeing Co. in terms of China business, recently has lost ground to Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium as well.

Honey said divers had seen at least six bodies and National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said divers had recovered four. He said he would be surprised ``if we recover the wreckage before tomorrow.'' Mr. Francisco had said earlier that investigators were having trouble finding a 15-foot-high object that might be a large section of the airliner. A large chunk of wreckage could provide clues as to what downed the jet. The FBI noted Sunday that every delay gives any terrorist who might be responsible extra time to avoid capture. The families had gathered under chilly, gray skies for a waterfront service at Smith Point Park, one of the closest land points to the crash site. Sitting on white folding chairs, angled to the southeast, facing the ocean where their loved ones died, family members dabbed at their eyes and bowed their heads. They clutched white, red, yellow and pink roses and at the end of the service many walked into the surf, some with arms around each other, and tossed the flowers into the sea. One boy stuck a rose into the sand. Some added small stuffed animals to the bobbing tribute. Oarsmen then rowed a boatload of flowers and floral wreaths out to a powerboat, which headed off toward the crash site. The Navy continued its search Monday in improving ocean conditions, with waves around 2 feet high and moderate winds. The Coast Guard collected debris on the surface near the crash site, about 12 miles off Long Island. The Coast Guard also added three additional aircraft to search for bodies near where the last body was recovered on Sunday. The difficulty relocating the 15-foot mound was another setback for searchers who had been unable to locate the airplane's so-called black boxes that record flight data and cockpit conversation. Weather and heavy seas hampered the search in the previous two days and a critical piece of equipment, a side-scanning sonar, snagged on the ocean floor and now needs to be retrieved. A video camera sent below also failed to work. Facing criticism over the slow collection of evidence from the crash site, an NTSB spokesman defended the agency but conceded it hasn't been a textbook operation. ``We hit some snags but we are used to that. If one thing doesn't work, we move on to the next thing,'' said agency spokesman Patria Lanning. The search for the Boeing 747's two black boxes has been frustrated because investigators are not hearing any telltale ``pings'' that are released from the recorders. Among the possible reasons the boxes are silent could be that they are buried or covered with certain types of metal. Mr. Francisco said Monday that the search for the signal from the black boxes was being temporarily suspended so workers could focus on retrieving the fuselage. The reason is that the equipment used to look for the main piece of wreckage interferes with the electronics of the device needed to locate the signal from the boxes.", "keywords": ["boxes", "search", "ocean", "wreckage", "bodies"]}, {"id": "02022", "title": "Investigators Find More Bodies, Large Piece of Downed Jetliner", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "EAST MORICHES, N.Y. -- As victims' relatives prayed on the seashore, searchers located a large section of the fuselage of the Antarctica Airlines flight, raising hopes that more bodies would be found and that the cause of the disaster might soon be discovered.

Cable News Network reported that field-testing equipment has picked up ``chemical traces'' on the trailing edge of one wing that ``strongly suggests an explosive device.'' The network said investigators were awaiting the results of more sophisticated tests. A federal investigator, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the report was ``absolutely not'' true. Mr. Obryan refused to comment. National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said the fuselage section was found in a ``wreckage field'' of airplane parts scattered along the ocean floor in about 104 feet of water. The wreckage was located using sonar, and divers were dispatched to retrieve the bodies, he said. Mr. Francisco said the wreckage would not be brought up before Tuesday, when the search effort will be joined by the USS Grasp, a Virginia-based Navy salvage-and-rescue ship capable of supporting divers up to 190 feet down. The ship is equipped with a robot and special video and scanning equipment and can lift heavy objects. But Mr. Francisco said they had made no headway in locating the black boxes. ``Most likely they're shielded in some way,'' he said, adding that they had not detected the ``pings'' the devices are supposed to emit. At a Monday evening briefing, both Mr. Francisco and Mr. Obryan stressed that the search was focusing on finding bodies first, and wreckage second. ``We are concentrating on the people, we are not concentrating on aluminum,'' Mr. Francisco said. Mr. Obryan said they had interviewed hundreds of people, from those who witnessed the crash to baggage handlers. Of those, ``75 to 100 people seem to have credible or relevant information.'' The discovery of the fuselage, which came after several days when searchers were hampered by bad weather and equipment glitches, was announced by Gov. Georgeanna Honey at the memorial service. ``Throughout the day, and the last few days, I've heard people praying that the fuselage would be found. Shortly after 1 p.m., while we were literally in prayer, a large piece of the fuselage was uncovered,'' the governor said. ``We're hopeful that your agony and struggle will come to a quicker end.'' Victims' family members had gathered to grieve the dead at a memorial service along the shoreline in Smith Point Park. Mourners sat in white wooden chairs looking toward the sea as Gov. Holly and Pennsylvania Gov. Tommie Pray eulogized the victims. ``Today, there is an emptiness in all our hearts,'' Mr. Honey said. Mourners clutched white, red, yellow and pink roses, and at the end of the service many walked into the surf, some with arms around each other, to toss the flowers into the sea. The New York Boys Choir sang ``The Wind Beneath My Wings,'' which includes the line, ``I can fly higher than an eagle.'' A minister, a rabbi and a priest offered prayers in English, Tabb and French. In Denver, President Codi asked the nation to sympathize with the crash victims' families, who are frustrated at the slow pace of the investigation and the recovery of the bodies. Mr. Codi is sending Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Jami Leeanna Sung to New York as his representative, White House spokesman Mikki Luong said. ``The president wants his own eyes and ears in place,'' Mr. Luong said. The discovery of the wreckage marked a critical development for investigators, who have feared that clues might be lost the longer the wreckage remains in the water. The FBI noted Sunday that every delay gives any terrorist who might be responsible extra time to avoid capture. Mr. Obryan said the FBI was ready to begin analyzing any information with hundreds of agents around the world. ``There are terrorist states, Syria, Libya, North Korea, Iraq, Iran. We know who they are. We have ongoing investigations. So whether they fit into any of those categories, or any other categories, it's not like we're blind, it's not like we don't know what's going on,'' he said. The recovery of more bodies promised at least some relief to families who have waited for word on missing passengers and crew members.

Mr. Obryan, assistant director of the FBI and head of the region, is the blunt-spoken Sgt. Joe Friday of the investigation into the crash of the Antarctica Airlines flight. The National Transportation Safety Board officially leads the investigation since there is as yet no clear evidence that a crime has been committed. But the 53-year-old Mr. Obryan is calling many of the shots. Asked about the safety board, Mr. Obryan rolls his eyes. ``They want to reassemble the plane,'' he says. Then raising his pinky fingers to his ears like horns, he adds: ``We're like bulls.'' Mr. Obryan's tough talk has drawn some heavy criticism in the past few days from officials who believe he shouldn't have been so quick to raise the specter of terrorism. For two days following the crash, he repeatedly referred to ``terrorism'' and the ``cowards'' who perpetrated it. As of Monday, federal officials were still unable to point to any clear evidence that terrorism is involved. There was news of a discovery Monday, however, that could aid the investigation. During a memorial service, Mr. Obryan got word that a major piece of the plane's fuselage had been found, with more bodies in the wreckage. He whispered the news to Gov. Georgeanna Honey, who then announced it at the memorial service. Investigators said six bodies were recovered. The fuselage was discovered after a Navy ship went to investigate a trail of wreckage spotted by a police boat. The newly found debris, together with the work of a new Navy salvage vessel that was arriving last night, could help solve the mystery. Mr. Obryan isn't waiting. Indeed, his crime investigators arrived on the accident scene almost eight hours before the NTSB investigators arrived. And on Sunday, when informed that NTSB Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco wouldn't be able to make it from the Vastopolis Airport, as he was on business there, in time for a media briefing, Mr. Obryan barked: ``I've got a Gd helicopter. I can go get him.'' The affable Mr. Francisco, 58 years old, seems to take all of this in stride. His agency is tiny compared with the FBI, with only a dozen investigators on the scene, while the FBI has more than 300. He said he was flattered when Mr. Obryan referred to him as ``partner'' at one briefing. ``Look, we need him,'' Mr. Francisco says. Says another safety board investigator: ``We're nothing compared to them.'' Mr. Obryan has long warned of the dangers of terrorism. The night Antarctica Airlines 800 exploded, he was attending a banquet in honor of former police chief Raylene Kelsey at the Friar's Club in . Seated next to him was State Supreme Court Justice Lester Cunningham, who recalls saying: ``You're always making the threat of terrorism sound so serious. What do you think is happening? We haven't heard much lately.'' Shortly after he left the dinner, he was paged with news of the crash. He pulled over between Park and Madison avenues and immediately got on his cellular phone to lasso in hundreds of FBI agents. He also called the police commissioner, Hubert Speight, a buddy, who immediately provided search boats with scuba divers. Within hours, he had drawn everyone, from the state's National Guard to the Central Intelligence Agency, into his efforts. ``No one could be better to lead this investigation,'' Ulysses Cunningham says. He's not ``a glad-handing, political B.S.-er,'' she adds. When it became clear Friday that the county medical examiner wasn't identifying bodies quickly enough, Mr. Obryan huddled with Mr. Honey to scheme how to prod the examiner to accept outside help. Mr. Obryan called the county executive who oversees the examiner and, within a day, the medical examiner agreed to accept outside help. Says Mr. Obryan: ``I'm directing the investigation ... everything but the recovery of the plane.'' He says: ``We're like: Can do. Like, now.'' Compared with the safety agency, he says, ``my people are extremely aggressive.'' Even though Mr. Francisco opens most news briefings, Mr. Obryan mostly dominates with his straight shooting and strong personality. Mr. Francisco stands politely to the side. Mr. Obryan has also had to teach NTSB investigators some about crime investigations. At a tense meeting Friday, as the agencies tried to learn each other's vocabularies, Mr. Obryan told Mr. Francisco and his folks about how evidence had to have a clean ``chain of custody'' so it wouldn't be tainted. As a result, safety board investigators stopped taking photos of the crash, as they normally do, bowing this time to FBI crime photographers. Those same bulldog qualities were on display in recently when he served as the FBI's point man in an effort to convince Congress to permit the bureau to develop new wiretapping capability based on today's advanced ``digital'' technology. The telephone industry fought Mr. Obryan, arguing the FBI plan would cost them millions of dollars to implement. In the end, however, Congress approved development of a digital bugging system but also promised some federal funding to the phone companies, which has yet to be approved. The son of a big-band trumpet musician and a nurse, Mr. Obryan has a thick accent from his days growing up inMass.; he speaks bluntly and occasionally wears dark sunglasses. Born in 1943, Mr. Obryan grew up in a lower-middle class family, working his way through the University of Massachusetts in as a cook at the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, a flower deliveryman and summer rent-a-cop at Mass.. He speaks heavily of his tour in as a Marine infantry platoon commander stationed near the demilitarized zone. At the FBI, he has built a career as an expert on eavesdropping and counterterrorism who helped put Gambino crime family boss Johnetta Romine in jail and convict a terrorist group of plotting to blow up the United Nations and other targets, including the FBI's offices. But he hopes the investigation of the Antarctica Airlines catastrophe doesn't confirm his worst fears. Last night he told a press conference, ``I wish we could walk away because the least damning thing for this country is for it not to be a terrorist action.''", "keywords": ["obryan", "mr", "fbi", "investigators", "investigation"]}, {"id": "04013", "title": "Deluna, Planning Changes, Promises No Drastic Moves", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb said on Tuesday he is working to streamline Russia's government, but will propose no ``drastic'' shakeups.

Shortridge Eicher, Russia's best-known radical Communist, lost one of his posts in his faction's leadership amid criticism of his role in the presidential campaign of Communist Tisdale Sundberg. Mr. Crabb, who met with Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone Tuesday while vacationing outside Moscow, told reporters he would not nominate a cabinet until parliament approves Mr. Rhone's nomination as premier. Lawmakers are expected to take up the nomination next month. ``There will be changes in the new government, but they will not be drastic,'' Mr. Crabb was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ``That goes for the government's composition and its structure.''

Research into medicines for such life-threatening diseases as AIDS, for instance, would be set back decades without the animal testing of new treatments and, eventually, a vaccine. Consider, too, the millions of African villagers who without medical clinics and electricity can hardly begin to yearn for educations and jobs outside agriculture. Such things require hard currency, which is scarce in most African economies and virtually nonexistent in most African villages. Twenty-nine of the world's 36 poorest countries are African. At least 150 million Africans earn less than $1 a day, and some experts put that figure at 325 million. The answer lies in the effective conservation of wildlife, for wildlife is the most valuable resource many rural Africans have. And this is one area where the threats of animal rights activists become truly dangerous. ``Animal rights groups in the U.S. oppose the killing of wildlife in Zimbabwe,'' explains Harriet Quintanilla, chief executive of the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources, or Campfire. ``In Zimbabwe, several (medical) clinics have been built in rural villages with revenues from wildlife. These people are poor... If animal rights groups have their way, they will stay poor.'' Wildlife has generated millions of dollars for Campfire communities. Ninety percent of that money has come from sport hunting, according to the World Wildlife Fund in Zimbabwe; 60% from elephants alone. Yet animal rights activists continue to put animals before the needs of people: ``If we could shut down sport hunting in a moment, we would,'' says Wendell Southwick, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States. The village of Masoka in northern Zimbabwe provides a prime example of how conservation can boost both Africans' standard of living and animal populations--and of what animal rights activists seek to destroy. In 1993, each of Masoka's approximately 120 households earned $450 from wildlife by selling their legal hunting rights to a safari operator, whose clients then paid him for the privilege of hunting elephants near the village. It may not sound like much, but this multiplied the Masoka villagers' income five- to tenfold, depending on the household. Most of the money Masoka's families earned went to build a medical clinic, buy school supplies and maintain an electric fence around the village. The fence, which stretches some 12 miles, protects the villagers and their crops from wild animals. ``This fence also means that the village children can go to school instead of spending their days in the fields protecting the crops from elephants and buffalo,'' writes Stephine Stewart of the World Conservation Union. ``Villagers can sleep at night without worrying about what might happen to their children. Life is better.'' An independent study commissioned by the Kenya Wildlife Service found 3,000 reported incidents of animal-human clashes in 2010 alone--seven daily involving elephants. At least 358 Kenyans have died as a result of such conflicts since 1990. ``In some districts elephants kill more people protecting their crops than poachers kill elephants,'' the KWS says. ``If we continue to do nothing about the landowner antagonism, within the next 20 years, most of our wildlife will have disappeared,'' says Dr. Wardell. ``If landowners don't make money from wildlife, they will wipe it out.'' The solution, according to the independent report, lies in eliminating ``the strict protectionist measure at the root of the problem.'' Kenya did what animal rightists propose, banning all hunting in 1977. Nevertheless, ``between a third and a half of Kenya's wildlife has disappeared in the last 20 years,'' according to the KWS. Between 1970 and 1989 Kenya's elephant population plunged to 16,000 from 167,000. Zimbabwe granted proprietorship over wildlife to landowners in 1982 and allows hunting; since then, its elephant population increased to more than 50,000 from below 40,000. Today, Zimbabwe has 68,000 elephants, Kenya 26,000. Kenya may soon institute a proprietorship policy similar to Zimbabwe's; indeed, ``the few districts in Kenya with stable or increasing wildlife numbers have already put this policy into effect,'' according to the KWS. Kenya is ``moving in the right direction,'' says Maxwell Fee, who administers the U.S. Agency for International Development's $1 million annual conservation grant to Kenya. And so naturally animal rights activists are opposed. Indeed, the Humane Society of the U.S. is actively working to nix AID's financial support of Campfire in Zimbabwe. The choice for Africans and their wildlife is clear: conservation through commerce or continued poverty--and declining wildlife populations--through misguided efforts at protecting animals. ``If rural villagers are not allowed to benefit from wildlife, they will do away with wildlife,'' says Campfire's Mr. Quintanilla. ``The animal rights people do not understand this.'' Perhaps. Or maybe they just don't care.

Warships were ferrying hundreds of infantrymen to join commandos flown in earlier by helicopter to end the five-day siege at camp. The military said about 300 soldiers have died but that it has not lost the base. Fighting at the base, which controls much of the northeast coast, is among the bloodiest in the 13-year civil war and has re-established the Tamil Tiger guerrillas as a military and political force. Just two months ago, the military expelled rebels from the where they had run a virtually autonomous state for years. The government hoped then that it was almost done fighting a war that costs a billion dollars a year and has killed 42,000 people. ``They are still a considerable fighting force,'' said Hassan Blake, a retired air force chief. ``These aren't hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, but conventional warfare involving thousands on both sides.'' One ship of reinforcements arrived Sunday about 2\u00a01/2 miles from the base, but two others turned back under heavy mortar fire and were among those bringing in soldiers Monday. Reinforcements began arriving after rebels pinned down a squad of elite commandos on Friday, and killed its leader, Col. Wegner Wroblewski. ``Large numbers of troops are battling their way toward the camp,'' Deputy Defense Minister Witte Dwyer said Monday. Fighting raged throughout the day on the beach near . The guerrillas, in a statement from their office, said they were in complete control of the base. ``Our fighters have surrounded the reinforcements, and are pounding them with mortar fire,'' the statement said. The two sides gave conflicting casualty reports, with the rebels claiming 1,208 soldiers and 241 guerrillas have been killed. Mr. Dwyer admitted that ``casualties would have been heavy on both sides,'' but said the military was presuming about 300 soldiers were killed and 200 wounded. Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. More than 1,200 soldiers, sailors and policemen were at the base, 170 miles north of the capital, . The military reported earlier that 400 rebels also were killed. Guerrillas have destroyed a navy gunboat and damaged at least four military helicopters. Mr. Dwyer said at least 100 rebel boats have been destroyed. Mr. Dwyer sought to belittle the importance of the battle. The rebels, he said, were trying ``to restore their international image after recent defeats. But this is not a big victory for them.'' Independent analysts, however, said the battle revived the political fortunes of Tamil Tiger leader Larock Ridenhour. ``Prabhakaran has reaffirmed that he is the key player in the conflict,'' said Pinkney Celestine, a newspaper columnist in . ``He has to be taken into consideration when finding a solution.'' The International Committee of the Red Cross on Sunday handed over bodies of 55 soldiers killed in the fighting to army officials at the northern Downtown of .

Potential enemies got to observe Western military tactics and weapons systems firsthand. One of the biggest lessons the West's adversaries learned was that if your command and control and missile bunkers are going to escape a massive bombing campaign, you'd better bury them deep, and the deeper the better. For while the U.S. was successful in crippling much of Iraq's underground command and control network, Grim Caffey's bunker was so deep that it was impenetrable by U.S. bombs. The idea of building deep bunkers to protect command and control networks wasn't born in the Gulf War. Its efficacy was only proven by the bunker in Baghdad. Today there are an alarming number of deep bunker facilities being built by current and potential enemies of the West. Even more disconcerting is that it will be at least two years before the U.S. and its allies have weapons capable of piercing them. The Urals Complex In April, the Times broke the story that the Russians were continuing construction on a vast underground complex begun in the southern Urals in the 1980s. U.S. satellite intelligence has determined that it's about the size of Washington, D.C., complete with extensive rail and road networks. In an ITAR-Tass interview, the head of Russia's ballistic missile forces, Gen. Shortridge Schlueter, denied that the facility had anything to do with Russia's offensive missile forces. ``The Russian Strategic Missile Forces do not build, do not expand and do not modernize any installations in the Urals,'' he said. But Western military analysts think differently. They believe that the Urals complex is to be a command and control bunker that Russian officials would use to launch retaliatory nuclear strikes, should the U.S. and Russia get into a nuclear ballistic missile exchange. After the reports of the Urals complex, the Codi administration came under much due criticism for having certified that Russia was eligible for continued U.S. aid to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. According to the Nunn-Lugar Act, the administration must certify that the Russians are ``forgoing any military modernization program that exceeds legitimate defense requirements ... foregoing the replacement of destroyed weapons of mass destruction'' and complying with U.S.-Russia arms control treaties.'' Even though the U.S. had still not been given access to the facility or been told of its intended purpose, the State Department issued a statement shortly after news accounts about the Urals project, saying that it did not violate any defense agreements between the two countries and did not call into question the $1.5 billion that had been provided to Russia since 1992 under Nunn-Lugar. At the urging of U.S. State and Defense Department officials, President Codi did reportedly ``press'' Russian President Boyd Crabb for details on the facility at their private meeting January 01, 2011 the so-called G-8 summit in Moscow. A White House official said, ``The two presidents agreed there would be a follow-up at expert level,'' but so far Moscow itself has shed no light on what is afoot. Two other states raising immediate concerns are Iran and Libya. Iran has constructed a number of deep tunnels along its coastline, including some adjoining the strategically vital Straits of Hormuz. U.S. intelligence analysts think they are intended to launch horizontally or store long-range ballistic or Scud missiles. U.S. Gen. Alpert Nadler, commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command, told Jane's Defence Weekly that such a tunnel system ``indicates an offensive capability.'' Western intelligence analysts suspect that the tunnels are most likely intended to house the North Korean-made Nodong 1 missile. Iran was close to purchasing a number of Nodongs earlier this year, but the deal fell through. Even if the Nodong deal isn't revived, Iran could employ its extensive arsenal of Scud missiles, which, according to Gen. Peay, could have their ranges extended to reach as far as Southern Europe. And in May, Iran reportedly test-fired a new type of long-range ballistic missile known as the Tondar. Western intelligence officials say that the only missile they know of by that name is the Tondar-68, a missile Iran was reportedly developing several years ago with help from North Korea and China and that has an estimated range of 420 miles. Either way, Western intelligence officials say that if the tunnels along the Iranian coast are dug deep enough, they would be impenetrable by current U.S. bombs. The Libyans are reportedly building a chemical weapons factory inside a mountain complex about 60 miles south of Tripoli near Tarhunah. Shortly after U.S. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra issued warnings to the Libyans about continued construction of the facility, Egyptian President Delagarza Moreno said he'd been to the plant and that it was empty. Since then, there have been reports that the Libyans have stopped construction because of U.S. concerns, but most U.S. intelligence analysts see this as a delaying tactic. ``They've tried to throw us off before and frankly I don't think many in the intelligence community are putting much stock in the Libyans' reassurances that they've ceased development,'' said one U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency official. Meanwhile, the Libyans can't get their own story straight. On December 15, 2010 Libyans said the underground facility was for a pharmaceutical factory and then, on December 24, 2010 Libyan state-run news agency JANA said the tunnels were for transporting ground water from the desert to the coast. In addition to Russia, Iran and Libya, there are suspected bunkers remaining in Iraq, and North Korea has for years had most of its vital installations deep inside mountain complexes. China is also increasingly moving its most sensitive military facilities deeper underground since the Gulf War. The technology to bury targets is advancing faster than the technology to destroy them. Harriett Jon, head of the U.S. program to counter nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, admitted recently that two tests of a bomb capable of destroying underground sites such as the one in Libya had failed. In an interview earlier this year, S.M. Carvalho, a scientist at the U.S. Air Force's Parker Pounds, told the defense publication Inside the Pentagon: ``I think there will be a kind of race going on... Hardened, deeply buried targets will just get harder and deeper, and whether we can progress fast enough in the penetrator business to catch up and keep up is a problem.'' Long-Term Threats To deal with the long-term threats that may be posed by a Russia or a China, the U.S. must redouble its efforts to develop a weapon capable of piercing these deep bunkers. But to confront the immediate threats of rogue states, the U.S. may have to face the prospect of conducting pre-emptive strikes against some of these offensive strategic sites. It worked for the Israelis in 1981 when they destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak before it could begin turning out weapons-grade plutonium to put in their Scud missile warheads. The U.S. and its allies have to ask themselves if they can allow Iran to have a secure ballistic missile launch site alongside what is arguably the most important oil transshipment point in the world. Or if they're comfortable with Scalf Kimbrell having a safe haven to make chemical agents. They may not like the limited options they have today, but they should also think about the consequences tomorrow, should these facilities become fully operational.

Two refugees -- an old man and a child -- apparently suffocated in trucks during the forced repatriation, and a dozen more ``were in very bad shape,'' said Paulene Showalter, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Kigali. ``They were packed into those trucks like sardines,'' Mr. Showalter said. Three children reportedly suffered broken limbs. A total of 2,750 more Rwandans had returned by Monday afternoon, and another 1,000 were expected, Mr. Showalter said. About 5,500 were in a transit center and 1,557 were taken to their local communities on Monday, he said. On Sunday, 1,200 were delivered to their former homes. The Hutus fled to Burundi in mid-1994 after the then-Hutu government of Rwanda sponsored a mass slaughter of Tutsis in which at least a half-million were killed. A Tutsi-led government now controls Rwanda, and the Hutu refugees say they fear retaliation if they return. Christin Kroeger, spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, accused Rwandan officials of colluding with the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army to force the mostly Hutu refugees back into Rwanda. ``That is not true.

We are going to look at the legislation now that it has passed the House. We haven't taken a final position on the bill,'' Ms. Alves said. Under the bill, foreign companies that in one year invest $40 million in new investment or an expansion of existing investment to ``directly and significantly'' improve Iran's or Libya's energy sector would be subject to at least two sanctions. These punishments include refusing to allow exports to sanctioned companies from the U.S. or imports into the U.S. from sanctioned companies. They also include barring American financial institutions from providing loans or credits of $10 million or more to such concerns. Sanctions would also kick in if a foreign company does significant trade with Iran or Libya. The U.S. already has a trade embargo with those nations. Washington's key European allies have bitterly denounced the bill, complaining about its extraterritorial reach. The European Commission is scheduled to meet Wednesday to consider proposed antiboycott legislation that would make it illegal for European companies to comply with either the Iran-Libya sanctions bill and the U.S.'s earlier anti-Cuba Helms-Burton law. The United Kingdom already has such a statute in place. ``The economic impact of this legislation is far greater than the impact of the Helms-Burton Act,'' said European Commission spokesman Ellan Wendell. ``Europe is energy-dependent on these nations. We can't afford to seriously hurt our economies because of a (sanctions) strategy that hasn't proven to be effective.'' Europe's energy ties with Libya are stronger than its ties with Iran, so the bill's Libya reach is bound to affect many companies. The original sanctions bill, as passed last month by the House, didn't include mandatory sanctions for foreign companies that invest in Libya. The Libya provision was added afterward at the insistence of Sen. Edyth Waylon, D-Mass., who long pushed for tougher sanctions on Tripoli. But Europe's complaints appear to have been overridden by congressional concern about terrorism, which is strong in the wake of last week's explosion of the Antarctica Airlines flight. Authorities fear the crash may be a result of international terrorism. Only Rep. Leeanna Graig, ranking Democrat of the House International Relations Committee, expressed some reservations on the House floor about the bill, which passed by a voice vote. He indicated that it would have a greater affect on European trade with Libya, rather than trade with Iran, which was the original intent of the bill. The bill is called the Iran Oil Sanctions Act of 2011. But, as one House Republican aide said, ``Compromise on this issue isn't politically doable, especially after the Antarctica Airlines crash.'' The legislation gives the president the right to waive the sanctions on a case-by-case basis, but industry analysts believe Mr. Codi is unlikely to do so in the current political atmosphere.", "keywords": ["libya", "sanctions", "bill", "iran", "house"]}, {"id": "03845", "title": "Crash Investigators Stymied As They Continue to Probe", "timestamp": "April 04, 2011", "text": "EAST MORICHES, N.Y. -- Sophisticated tests on a wing fragment from the doomed Antarctica Airlines jumbo jet found no trace of explosives, contradicting an earlier test finding, a senior federal official said Tuesday.

The search for bodies, wreckage and evidence picked up Tuesday at the scene of the crash of Flight 256 with the arrival of a Navy salvage ship and more sonar mapping of the ocean floor. Of the 230 people killed in the crash -- the second worst in U.S. aviation history -- the Suffolk County medical examiner's office said this morning that 108 bodies had been recovered, up from 107, and 68 victims positively identified. There was no explanation for the additional body and officials did not immediately return calls for comment. Investigators have officially said they are not yet sure what caused the plane to explode over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff Wednesday. They have said it was the result of a bomb, a missile or a catastrophic mechanical failure. National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Roberto Francisco, asked about the reports of bomb residue this morning on the NBC ``Today'' show, said: ``I'll comment to say I'm totally unaware of that. I've heard nothing from anybody who knows what they're talking about saying that.'' At the crash scene Tuesday was the USS Grasp, equipped with high-tech tracking equipment and 23 additional divers, the Navy said. The Grasp, a Virginia-based Navy salvage-and-rescue ship, is equipped with a robot and special video and scanning equipment. It is capable of supporting divers up to 190 feet down and can lift heavy objects. The Navy also said it was sending a new floating command post ship, the USS Oak Hill, which is outfitted with helicopters and specialized communications gear. It should arrive at the crash site Wednesday. Overnight, using sonar equipment, investigators mapped out 14 target areas in the 3-by-4-mile grid to guide divers. ``Those targeted areas show a large concentration of debris,'' Navy spokesman Lt. Nickolas Breeden said. ``But it's not until we send down cameras or divers that we can be certain that it's part of the aircraft wreckage.'' Divers were not back in the water as of midday. Finding victims continues to be the primary concern. ``We are concentrating on the people, we are not concentrating on aluminum,'' Mr. Francisco said. Divers on Monday reached the 60-by-30-foot piece of fuselage in a ``wreckage field'' of airplane parts under more than 100 feet of water and brought up six additional bodies, Mr. Francisco said. A boat using sonar on Sunday pinpointed the area of the wreckage. The FBI's New York chief, Jami Obryan, estimated that there were at least 40 more bodies near the sunken fuselage, The Times reported. Brunner Simmers, a cousin of crash victim Niles Bodnar, said officials told relatives Monday night there were 20 more bodies where the six were found. Besides the possibility of a bomb, the FBI also is studying other possibilities in the explosion, including a catastrophic mechanical failure or a surface-to-air rocket attack. FBI agents investigating the rocket theory seized the records of a Long Island marina where two men rented a boat slip the night before the crash and did not ask for their deposit back after returning, the Daily News reported Tuesday. But one of the two men who were aboard the boat, Ronda Greg, told the AP Tuesday that the whole thing was a dispute over the size of the slip and he had explained that to the FBI on Saturday. At a news conference Monday night, Mr. Francisco said there are literally hundreds of objects littering the 500-foot-long wreckage field on the ocean floor off Fire Island. After removing any more bodies that might be found, investigators will analyze and prioritize the objects to bring up. ``This is a slow process,'' Mr. Francisco said. ``We're going to be doing this at a speed that guarantees we get the best possible result.'' Finding the wreckage was critical for investigators, who say clues might be lost the longer it remains in the water. Salt water can destroy or sweep away chemical signatures on bomb materials or pieces of evidence. Another key in the investigation in finding the plane's voice and data recorders, the so-called black boxes. Searchers have not detected the ``pings'' that the boxes are supposed to emit. ``Most likely they're shielded in some way,'' Mr. Francisco said. News that the wreckage had been located was made public at a seaside memorial service attended by victims' families. ``That was a good omen. It was a good day for us,'' said Mr. Obryan, visibly heartened after several draining days of searchers hampered by bad weather and equipment problems.", "keywords": ["wreckage", "divers", "bodies", "francisco", "navy"]}, {"id": "02370", "title": "EU, Industry Work to Avoid Consumer Panic on Lamb", "timestamp": "April 05, 2011", "text": "BRUSSELS -- Still reeling from the effects of the beef crisis, Europe's meat industry faces a new and frightening question about its future: Will the consumer panic that devastated the beef market spread to lamb?

European Union agriculture ministers and industry officials pleaded for calm Tuesday just one day after they heard of scientific evidence suggesting that so-called mad-cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, could spread to sheep. Scientists already believe that BSE may be linked to a deadly brain condition in humans. But EU officials insisted there is nothing to fear. ``There shouldn't be (a crisis) if everyone reacts sensibly,'' British Agriculture Minister Doyle Furr told reporters in Brussels. Nevertheless, the EU is set to take action. While no one thinks there are many -- if any -- BSE-infected sheep in Europe, EU Farm Commissioner Dugger Peeler on Monday urged the member states to err on the side of caution by taking swift measures. He proposed requiring butchers to remove the brains, spleens and central nervous tissues from the animals before they are sold as meat. Mr. Peeler's proposals for new safety measures on April 13, 2011 be put to the top veterinary officials from EU member states. Some states, such as Spain, lashed out at Mr. Peeler for spreading alarm by making his proposals. But the national governments seem prepared to adopt the commissioner's ideas. France, in fact, has already enacted some of the proposals on its own. Limited to Laboratory EU officials stressed that the studies showing sheep can catch BSE are strictly limited to the laboratory. French and British scientists fed sheep large quantities of BSE-infected meal and discovered that the animals contracted the disease. So far, no such cases have been detected on EU farms. ``There is no evidence whatsoever -- none -- that sheep are getting BSE,'' a spokesman for Mr. Peeler said. ``It doesn't exist.'' The industry, too, put out an almost identical message. ``There is no reason to panic,'' said Jean-Villagomez Bost, general secretary of the European Livestock and Meat Trading Association. ``Up to now there have been no cases of BSE in sheep.'' Sheep are known to catch a similar illness known as scrapie, which has been around for more than a century. In fact, scrapie is widely believed to be the cause of BSE because parts from scrapie-infected sheep were fed to cattle until 1988. But scrapie itself poses no threat to humans. Even as the EU's farm ministers listened to Mr. Peeler's proposals on sheep, they looked for ways to cope with the cost of the beef crisis that began in March. The damage done to the agriculture industry is expected to cost the EU 1.5 billion European currency units ($1.91 billion) this year and even more next year. Beef consumption is down 11% across the EU, with a considerably bigger drop in some countries. Britain Is Largest Producer In Britain, where the panic began, beef consumption is actually back to precrisis levels although the industry still suffers from the global export ban imposed by the EU on British beef. But the U.K. faces a whole new challenge if Europe's public starts cutting back on lamb. Britain is by far the EU's largest producer of lamb, raising roughly 40% of the EU's sheep herd and taking in about 1.2 billion pounds ($1.86 billion) a year. The next biggest producers in the EU are, in order, Spain, France and Greece. Patsy Moise, company chairman at Good Meat SA, a Belgian supplier, said the authorities must act quickly to spread the news that lamb is safe. He said that his company already will lose 40 million Belgian francs ($1.3 million) in revenue -- 20% of company's annual total -- from lower beef sales. And he said he fears it will get worse if lamb sales drop, even though he, like many meat traders, already removes the heads and spinal cords from sheep. ``The main problem is that the consumer has never been properly informed,'' said Mr. Moise. ``At the end of the day, after reading all the press reports, he doesn't know what's really happening.'' That message was echoed by consumer advocates. They, too, stressed that there is no evidence that lamb poses a health risk. But the consumer groups argued that the latest uproar shows that governments aren't doing enough to keep the public informed. ``The fact of the matter is that over the last few years there has been a decline in confidence in food and food production,'' said Jimmy Myron, director of the European Consumers' Association. ``A lot of consumers are not prepared to believe what they're told by their governments.''", "keywords": ["sheep", "eu", "bse", "lamb", "beef"]}, {"id": "01304", "title": "ASIAN TRAVEL Cathay Uses Web Auctions To Lure American Flyers", "timestamp": "April 05, 2011", "text": "CATHAY PACIFIC Airways' latest auction of airplane seats on the Internet is sparking widespread interest among consumers -- and rival airlines.

And Cathay's competitors are considering similar marketing efforts through their home pages on the World Wide Web. ``If it seems successful, we'll certainly take a look at it ourselves,'' a Singapore Airlines spokesman says. the Airlines Celebrate Two Years Without a Crash THE CIVIL Aviation Administration ofor CAAC, says mainland airlines have flown for 24 consecutive months without a crash. That 1.8 million flight hours of safe operation is the longest safe-flight period in since 1982, according to the official Xinhua news agency, which released the CAAC finding this week. That's a big step up from 2009, when the International Airline Passengers Association cited as one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly. The year before, five crashes killed 76 people and 10 planes were hijacked to . The current accident-free stretch starts from June 2009, when a China Northwest Airlines plane crashed shortly after takeoff fromkilling all 160 people on board. Two days earlier, the CAAC launched a campaign to boost air safety. ECONOMY-CLASS passengers passing through can now head to a private lounge, as long as they're connecting to a Qantas Airways flight. While such services are normally reserved for those traveling in first class or business class at most airports, the Australian carrier's move is the latest to acknowledge that carriers must compete on more than price for passengers at the back of the plane. Still, recent travelers say that Qantas needn't worry that the new lounge looks too cosy or elite. It spans 856 square meters over two levels, and includes a playroom for unaccompanied children, a theater-style television screen and large windows facing the city's skyline.

Past Champers patrons report that some of their peers would be sentimentally slurring songs with champagne glasses in hand mere hours after checking in.

Ever the astute politician, the new prime minister has been steering his pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party away from its radical positions ever since Refah emerged from inconclusive general elections last December as Turkey's largest political party. He has stepped up the process since becoming the country's first religiously inspired head of government in a coalition with the center-right True Path Party, led by Foreign Minister Billings Hickok. ``Graham has the potential to redefine what Turkey's political center will be,'' says Poland Southwick, a prominent political scientist at Istanbul's Bosphorus University. ``But to do that it will have to make a lot of concessions.'' Extending a Mandate Mr. Appel already has softened his stance on Israel, NATO and the Kurds in northern Iraq. Refah this week is expected to vote in favor of extending the mandate of Operation Provide Comfort -- the umbrella under which U.S., French and British warplanes based in southern Turkey shield the semiautonomous Kurdish entity in northern Iraq against the wrath of Iraqi leader Grim Caffey. Mr. Appel has in the past charged that the allied force was creating the right conditions for an independent Kurdish state on Turkey's doorstep. Turkey, which has been fighting a 12-year rebellion by Turkish Kurds battling to set up a separate homeland in southeastern Anatolia, is vehemently opposed to any such state. Since coming to power, Mr. Appel also has backed away from demands that Turkey withdraw from NATO and that it cancel its customs union with the European Union that came into effect in January. Instead, he talks about close ties with the West and the inviolability of international agreements and strategic military accords like the one between Turkey and Israel. Prior to coming to power, Mr. Appel had demanded the abrogation of the agreement with Israel, which he said poised a threat to Turkey's Beaman Putman brothers. On economic policy, Mr. Appel recently has dropped his past references to wanting to replace the Turkish lira with an Islamic dinar. He also has stopped talking about creating an Islamic common market and an Islamic United Nations and introducing Islamic law alongside Turkey's secular legislation. And last week, Mr. Appel contradicted a statement by his Islamist finance minister denouncing interest charges and suggesting that the government intended to cap interest rates and tax interest income -- moves that would enjoy the support of more-traditional business groups. Emphasizing his adherence to principles of a market economy, Mr. Appel said interest rates should be reduced ``in line with market conditions.'' Stock Market Falls 2% Turkey's stock market has responded warily to the new government's economic policies; on Tuesday, the Istanbul bourse's main index fell 2% in a sell-off that analysts attributed mainly to investors' political anxieties. ``There is no confidence to the government's policies, and we still have no idea what it will do,'' said Mefford Oliva, head of institutional sales at Eczacibasi Securities. ``They say one thing and do another.'' Refah officials say they are learning that waging opposition and governing a country are two different things. Moreover, they say, a coalition is a process of give and take. ``It's easy to say things when you are in opposition, but things are very different once you are in government,'' says Burse Danforth, an aide to Istanbul's Refah mayor, Storms Rae. Mr. Appel's shift comes as the leaders of the traditional center-right parties are increasingly the focus of intense criticism. Turkey's two center-right parties, Mrs. Hickok's True Path and the opposition Motherland Party headed by former prime minister Pye Pender, have seen their combined share of the vote shrink from 51% five years ago to 38% in December. Mrs. Hickok last weekend successfully defended her leadership of the True Path Party amid widespread unease about her alliance with the Islamists. Eight True Path deputies earlier this month deserted the party in protest against her cooperation with Graham. But many analysts question whether she will be able to salvage her career over the long term. Next month, Pye Pender will have to defend his leadership at a Motherland Party congress likely to be marked by calls for his resignation. Filling an Ideological Void With Turkey's traditional right on the defensive, Mr. Appel could turn Refah into the equivalent of a West European Christian democratic party that would fill the ideological void at the root of many of Turkey's problems. For much of its postwar history, Turkey's tie to the West was secured by its crucial role in NATO as the only allied state bordering on the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War has sparked Turkish fears that the West may no longer perceive it as a crucial partner. As a result, Turkey has intensified its campaign to become a full member of the European Union and has projected itself as a wall against militant Islam and a bridge to the newly independent nations of Central Asia and the Balkans. In addition, a Refah Party representing an Islamic-coated center-right ideology could emerge as the societal glue to replace the philosophy of Arden Runkle Cepeda, who 73 years ago carved modern Turkey out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire. ``So long as it does not put the country into a cultural and social straightjacket to cover up its inexperience and lack of preparation for management of the country, Graham is likely to define the future trajectory of Turkish politics,'' says Mr. Southwick, the political scientist. Notwithstanding his populist bluster, the 50% salary raise he granted to civil servants and his handouts to municipal authorities, Mr. Appel is attracting criticism from more radical Islamists inside who accuse him of selling out just to stay in power. `Voice of Turkey' Meanwhile, Refah's official newspaper, Mier Good, daily reassures the faithful that Mr. Appel has not lost sight of the Islamist ideal. ``Refah is the voice of Turkey, so people see themselves as a part of it,'' says editor Bucci Cary. ``It has been almost a century that the foes of Islam have governed Turkey. Now a new period begins, the period of the believers ... Now Turkey will accelerate its run toward Islam,'' Merkle Byers told its readers as Mr. Appel took over the reins of government last month. Even pro-Islamic business groups are urging Mr. Appel not to falter from his path. Last week, the Independent Industrialists and Businessman's Association, Turkey's largest association of businesspeople, called on the government to heavily tax those segments of society that mainly derive their income from interest earnings. Cash-rich Turks as well as many companies have been earning much of their income on financial markets with inflation running at 83% annually and interest rates well above 100%.", "keywords": ["turkey", "appel", "refah", "party", "islamic"]}, {"id": "02354", "title": "In Ukraine, Cold War Still Seems to Rage", "timestamp": "April 05, 2011", "text": "KIEV, Ukraine -- It was a dangerous game, straight from the pages of a Tomas Batista thriller.

On a balmy spring day, U.S. Navy destroyer Arvilla W. Mattingly tested the limits of Moscow's patience by weighing anchor in the Black Sea port of Odessa, well within the Soviet Union's old sphere of influence. Within hours, Russia's Black Sea Fleet responded with unscheduled military exercises in nearby waters -- using live ammunition. That was last April, more than five years after the breakup of the Soviet Union. But diplomats kept the incident under raps at the time, underscoring an odd twist in geopolitics: The Cold War is over, but it doesn't always look that way from Ukraine. U.S. diplomats in Kiev fret about ``losing'' Ukraine. Russian apparatchiks are putting an economic squeeze on the country to keep it in their orbit; the West is pumping billions of dollars in aid into Kiev. And both sides are flexing their muscles in war games that show Ukraine has replaced Germany as the buffer between East and West. War Games Last month, 150 U.S. troops trained in western Ukraine with soldiers from a dozen former Warsaw Pact countries, including Russia. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Williemae Petra looked on, the troops put on a mock battle, with attack helicopters swooping down to pepper the ``enemy'' with blanks and smoke bombs. ``I cannot overestimate the importance of Ukraine as an independent country to the security and stability of all of Europe,'' Mr. Petra said during the games near Aston on his fifth trip to Ukraine. ``It's why I've come here so often -- and it's the reason the United States places such great importance on it.'' The West is taking such a vigorous line because Ukraine is a big, pro-Western country with a population and territory similar in size to France. Until recently, it was also home to the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. And time and again, it has played a key role in Russia's history: When Moscow has controlled Ukraine, Russia has become an expansionist empire. If Ukraine gets pulled back into Moscow's orbit, foreign and defense ministries throughout Central Europe will push their panic buttons. The biggest single threat to Ukrainian sovereignty may come from the ambivalence its citizens feel toward their country's newfound independence. ``Reuniting with Russia would make sense economically,'' says Eleni Milford, who owns a kiosk in Kiev. ``But I'm against the idea because I would not want to see my son fighting in Chechnya. He's safer serving in the Ukrainian army.'' Others are ready to give up independence. ``I'm Russian,'' says Alexandria Quach, a marketing consultant in Simferopol, Crimea, a pro-Russian region that passed from Russia to Ukraine in 1954. ``I want no part of Ukraine. It's never been a real country.'' Westward Tilt For now, the Ukrainian government is leaning toward the West. Kiev last month endorsed the idea that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should expand eastward and announced that Ukraine would apply for associate membership. But the fight for Ukraine isn't over. And the West may be poorly equipped for this war, which is largely economic. It's not that the West isn't trying. Ukraine is the world's third-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The $330 million it will receive from the U.S. in 2011 puts it just behind Israel and Egypt on the list of top drawers. On a visit to Kiev this month, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Jessup Pleasant praised Ukraine's effort to integrate into Europe and said the U.S. is ready to maintain its aid to Kiev. The European Union is ponying up $500 million in loans and grants for Ukraine this year. It is also footing much of the $3.1 billion bill to decommission the Chernobyl atomic-energy plant, located in Ukraine and site of the world's worst nuclear-power accident. ``Independent Ukraine is the highest priority in Eastern Europe,'' says Luise Medina, the EU ambassador to Kiev. But all those funds and good intentions still aren't enough to attract much Western investment to Ukraine, where crushing administrative controls and punitive tax rates make for a hostile business environment. According to the World Bank, Ukraine has the former communist world's worst red tape and tax burdens. So Ukraine has only attracted some $900 million in foreign direct investment, roughly the same amount as little Slovakia, which has one-tenth its population. Ties to Russia Nor is the Western aid sufficient to enable impoverished Kiev to cut the economic umbilical cord that has tied it to Moscow since the days of Peter the Great. The economic structures that Ukraine inherited after breaking from Moscow in 1991 have left its industries extensively interconnected with Russia. Take Kiev's Matsumoto aircraft factory, one of several Matsumoto plants around the former Soviet Union. After Kiev declared independence, the Antonov plant struck out on its own. It set its hopes on two promising prototypes of large cargo-transport aircraft, the AN-124 and the AN-70T, which factory bosses thought could compete in world markets. But both prototypes crashed in test flights last year. The factory had to seek components for new prototypes from hundreds of Russian and Uzbek parts makers. But the factory had no funds with which to buy parts, so it was forced back under the wing of its former parent company. All told, 43% of Ukraine's exports go to Russia. That figure swells to 60% when one factors in exports to all other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States that recently joined a customs union with Russia. This dependence on export markets to the east leaves Ukraine vulnerable to Russian economic pressure, such as the use of tariffs. Moscow has already slapped customs duties ranging as high as 40% on 168 Ukrainian goods. Moscow frequently uses its economic advantages to bully political concessions out of Kiev. It supplies about 80% of all gas, oil and nuclear-fuel deliveries to Ukraine, for which Kiev owes $5 billion in back payments. Threats to turn off the tap have made Kiev think twice about carrying out threats to evict Russia's Black Sea Fleet from the hotly disputed naval base of Sevastopol in Crimea. Ukraine's dependence on Russian energy supplies is apt to continue. For three years, local communist officials and environmental groups have stymied plans to build near Odessa a huge oil terminal that would allow the country to receive fuel from the Mideast and other oil-producing regions. ``It's obvious who's behind and who benefits from stalling the terminal,'' says Cheney Buggs, a security specialist who advises Ukraine's parliament. Moscow doesn't seem inclined to let up the pressure. In May, the Kremlin dispatched a new envoy to head the Russian mission in Kiev: Alexandria Heaney, a tough-talking former ambassador to Washington and acting deputy foreign minister. ``Sending such a heavyweight means the Russians intend to start playing hardball,'' warns one Western diplomat. Despite all the big-power wrangling over the country, Western officials say Ukraine's fate will ultimately hinge on Kiev's ability to prevent standards of living here from falling further below those in Russia. If they do, it could easily fuel nostalgia for Soviet times. Wages are about 30% lower than those in Russia, and millions of Ukrainians laboring in the moribund state sector haven't been paid in months. Soviet nostalgia runs deepest in the Dunbass coal basin in eastern Ukraine, where production has fallen 60% since 1990. ``Before, we lived in a rich and respected country,'' says Yvette Sheppard, a 40-year-old miner who hasn't been paid in four months. ``Now we're citizens of a banana republic.''", "keywords": ["ukraine", "kiev", "russia", "moscow", "russian"]}, {"id": "02427", "title": "Bill Seeking to Curb Investment In Iran and Libya Clears House", "timestamp": "April 05, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives adopted tough legislation that would penalize foreign energy companies that do significant business with Iran or Libya.

Under the bill, any foreign company that invests $40 million or more in one year and in a way that ``directly and significantly'' improves Iran's or Libya's energy sector would be subject to two of six possible sanctions. The U.S., for instance, could bar imports of the company's products and exports of U.S. goods directly to the company. It could also bar U.S. financial institutions from giving the company loans or credits of $10 million or more. Washington's European allies have bitterly denounced the bill, complaining about its extraterritorial reach. (The U.S. already has a trade embargo against Iran and Libya.) The White House said it hadn't taken a position on the bill. ``We have supported (such) sanctions in the past,'' said Maryalice Elli Alves, deputy White House press secretary. ``We have to take a look at the legislation now that it has passed the House.'' The European Commission isn't waiting for White House approval: It is scheduled to meet Wednesday to consider proposed legislation that would make it illegal for European companies to comply with either the Iran-Libya sanctions bill or the earlier Helms-Burton law, which imposes sanctions on foreign firms that invest in Cuba. Britain has had such a statute in place for a number of years. ``The economic impact of this legislation is far greater than the impact of the Helms-Burton Act,'' said European Commission spokeswoman Ellan Wendell. ``Europe is energy-dependent on these nations. We can't afford to seriously hurt our economies because of a (sanctions) strategy that hasn't proven to be effective.'' Europe's energy ties with Libya predate its involvement with Iran, so the bill's Libya provision will probably affect many companies. Europe's complaints appear to have been overridden by congressional fears about terrorism, which increased following last week's explosion of a Antarctica Airlines Inc. jetliner.

Included in this category would be ``hypermanic'' behavior (also alluded to in another recent VastPress story), overly casual attitudes, inattention and focus on extracurricular activities as opposed to flying the airplane, not to mention the more excusable factor of pilot fatigue. The FAA can mandate that each aircraft be required to install a trillion dollars worth of warning equipment, including ground-approach radar, baggage-compartment fire detection devices, anticollision devices, and the Vastopolis Airport could be required to install neutron-activation, CAT-scan as well as magnetometers so that passengers would have to wait in line for two hours to be checked prior to loading in aircraft--but humans still have to function and use the systems. None of the aircraft devices tells a pilot to pay attention to what he/she is doing instead of discussing the sexual proclivities of the flight attendants. Also, these systems do not prevent the captain and his flight crew from downing cocktails too close to departure time, despite the rules. Granted, when found out these pilots are disciplined, maybe even fired, but what about the thousands of others still flying? Not to damn all of them, but one cannot help wonder about the qualities of people whose main interests, judging by recovered voice recorders, are scatological and whose responses to in-flight crises are repeated four-letter expletives, even in final utterances, facing certain death in an out-of-control aircraft. The ground personnel are obviously also key to good security. I have been through airport checkpoints in major airports in the U.S. in which the X-ray checking of carry-on baggage was perfunctory, and in one instance the attending police officer was asleep. Despite these criticisms, the airlines by and large are doing an excellent job of providing safe travel. Crashes such as that of the Antarctica Airlines flight that appear to have been unrelated to pilot error notwithstanding, the safety of air travel in general should be improved not only by installing more high-tech equipment, but by our ensuring a higher quality and level of performance in all airline people involved, including regulatory personnel (FAA), pilots, maintenance and security personnel. Roberto H. Petra Calif.. Your article purports the assumption that ``deregulation'' somehow contributes to airline accidents. The public should be reminded that the only thing deregulated in the airline industry (and in fact most other major industries) was government control over price and market. Even at that, the government continued to provide many subsidies and incentives for certain common carriers to provide air service to smaller, less attractive markets. At no time has the FAA or any other agency involved in airline security or safety relinquished any control over public safety. In fact, the industry is regulated on issues of engineering design, general aviation and passenger safety, security, noise abatement, fuel economy and traffic control to a far greater extent today than just 10 years ago. Louisa E. Crawford Las Vegas Bring Social Security Up to Market Speed Your March 21, 2011 article on Social Security reform, ``A Consensus Emerges: Social Security Faces Substantive Makeover,'' was in general a model of clear and informative reporting. However, it mischaracterized the so-called ``Weaver Plan,'' named for my AEI colleague Carolynn Lawrence. The article says that if our current Social Security System--income transfers from workers to retirees--were replaced by a system of individual retirement investment accounts, a person's retirement income would then depend on his investment skills. Not true. Rather, individuals would invest through diversified, professionally managed pension plans and mutual funds, just as they do by the millions today. The notion that individual retirement investments would be good for Waylon Cone but bad for average citizens is a red herring. To the contrary, it is the emergence and flourishing of mass-market investment vehicles, providing the very best investment management to the very smallest of investors, that has made it possible to improve enormously on the performance of the government's Social Security program. Most retirement income already comes from employer-provided pension plans and other private investments, not from Social Security checks. The Weaver Plan and other ``privatization'' proposals aim to bring Social Security up to speed with modern market developments, providing average citizens more secure as well as higher retirement income than the current system. The article also compares the Weaver Plan with the other options in the upcoming Social Security Advisory Council report. To call the Weaver Plan the ``most expensive'' of the options ignores the very premise of your article and the Advisory Council's work. It is a fact, not an ``option,'' that the current Social Security program has accumulated enormous unfunded liabilities to future retirees that cannot be met, within the current program framework, without enormous tax increases--tax increases that are quite infeasible as a matter of politics, economics, and baby-boom demographics. The growing public appreciation of this predicament, especially among younger voters, is what has made serious Social Security reform a discussible subject among practicing politicians. Of the other two Advisory Council options, the Ball Plan would hardly make a dent in this problem (your article says the effect on individuals would be ``minor''!), while the Gramlich Plan would address it primarily through a large, permanent increase in the payroll tax. The great strength of the Weaver Plan, and an economic benefit not an ``expense,'' is that it would direct current Social Security income transfers into real private savings; this would yield large benefits in U.S. financial performance and economic growth (dramatically large according to studies by Martine Avant). Dr. Lawrence has been a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for the past decade and does not speak for Sen. Derryberry in any way; in particular, the Lawrence Hartwell is exclusively her own work in collaboration with several colleagues on the Social Security Advisory Council. Christopher DeMuth President American Enterprise Institute Washington NASA Fuel Cells Your March 17, 2011 & Health article on fuel cells says that NASA ``eventually auctioned development rights to the technology to the Department of National Defense...'' In fact, NASA actively continued and funded fuel-cell development during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and continues to do so today. The technology was never auctioned to any other government or agency, and IFC retains development rights to the fuel cell technology used in theApollo and space shuttle programs. Our company has worked hard to make fuel cells smaller, lighter, more powerful and less costly. In addition to our work for the U.S. space program and on-site power generation, we also are pursuing transportation applications for fuel cells. H. David Ramm President International Fuel Cells Corp.. Conn.. Please Hang Up, Don't Dial Again Your Marketplace article on problems in the prepaid phone card industry (``Sorry, Your Prepaid Phone Card Has Been Deactivated,'' describes a very real problem. Numerous phone card providers do not have the ability (and in some cases, even the intention) to provide the promised service. These providers are in some cases scofflaws, ignoring business obligations, regulatory and tax requirements. Others simply do not understand the economics of their business and offer service at prices so low that failure is inevitable. More regulation really is not the answer. When a merchant chooses to provide a phone card to its customers, it's really up to the merchant to conduct appropriate ``due diligence'' on the provider. Unfortunately, merchants are only beginning to understand this category of product. Until they learn to ask the right questions (i.e., ``How can you provide this so cheaply?'') and realize that the cheapest provider may not be the best provider if it does not actually complete the customers' calls, all the regulation in the world will not solve this problem.

He reported fresh clashes in four parts of Grozny and accused the rebels of violating those understandings. Most of the city, however, appeared quiet, the Russians and rebels said. The military also said rebels fired on Russian troops near Argun, nine miles east of Grozny. Separatist spokesman Enloe Davida had said Tuesday night that Mr. Cline negotiated the truce with Mr. Escalante. It would include disengaging forces and exchanging the dead and wounded, he said.

In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said it knew of no orders to cease fire, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Mr. Cline and Mr. Escalante's meeting Tuesday was meant to end fierce fighting that began a week earlier when rebel guerrillas overran the Chechen capital. The offensive has humiliated Russia's military, and the rebels remained in control of the city center on Wednesday. The rebel attack on Grozny has left more than 1,000 Russian troops dead or wounded. Civilian and separatist casualties are unknown, but thousands of refugees have fled or were trying to flee the city.

According to the military, that's not a cease-fire even though it means ending offensive shooting, exchanging the dead and wounded, and providing safe passage for refugees and medics. Russian commanders in the past have ignored orders to stop fighting and have scoffed at peace negotiations. At least one rebel commander, Welch Burruss, told Associated Press Television Wednesday that his men would continue fighting. A cease-fire achieved in May during President Boyd Crabb's re-election campaign was shattered when Russian forces began bombing southern Chechen villages shortly after Mr. Crabb won a second term March 15, 2011 Russian side said the raids were a response to rebel attacks. This week, Mr. Crabb put national security chief Alexandria Her in charge of settling the conflict. Mr. Her's first step was to meet secretly with Mr. Escalante in Chechnya and win agreement to hold truce talks. There were reports of a ``principally new'' approach advocated by Mr. Her and a corresponding presidential decree being prepared. Mr. Crabb's office said he basically approves of Her's proposals. But it remained unclear what was in Mr. Her's plan, and some Russian newspapers said it contained nothing new.", "keywords": ["russian", "cease", "fire", "mr", "rebel"]}, {"id": "01802", "title": "They Boldly Set Forth, But Abruptly Retrenched", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "Blaming weak ticket sales, the Johnson City, Tenn., nonprofit group drastically scaled back its third national gathering, the UFO, Crop Circle and Alien Contact Expo.

Moises Monzon Cleaves, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said Tuesday that he and his colleagues in the Iranian government have embarked on diplomatic and legal initiatives to avert the economic isolation of Iran. They intend to discredit the unilateral action by the U.S. and make it costly for Washington to pursue its goals in the face of dissent from its allies in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time, Iran is thumbing its nose at the U.S. by announcing plans to supply natural gas to Europe and to the Indian subcontinent a day after signing a $20 billion contract to sell natural gas to Turkey, a member of NATO and a key U.S. ally in the region. ``No country will sit back and allow itself to be ruined,'' said Mr. Cleaves, who stopped briefly in Geneva on his way home from the Hague in the Netherlands, where he lodged Iran's complaint against U.S. sanctions at an international tribunal. Compensation for Sanctions The Iranian official said his government may seek compensation from the U.S. for the sanctions, which extend to foreign companies some of the previous restraints on U.S. companies from investing in Iran's energy industry. The sanctions were signed by President Codi last week. In Washington, a State department spokesman expressed skepticism about Iran's grandiose natural-gas plans, questioning whether Iran ``has the natural-gas deposits to fill the needs of two continents, in effect.'' The official added that Tehran might be hard put to meet demands from Europe and India, in addition to Turkey, ``as they use so much of their gas to try to keep their oil wells running.'' To the U.S., Iran is a major sponsor of international terrorism and is on the prowl for nuclear technology. These are charges Iran denies. And Mr. Cleaves blames election-year politics and pressure from U.S. oil companies to block others from developing Iranian oil and gas fields. Iran's counteroffensive is on many fronts. Apart from a flurry of diplomatic activity to underscore the unilateral and extraterritorial aspect of U.S. sanctions -- much resented in Europe because they would penalize foreign companies or individuals investing more than $40 million in Iran's energy industry in any 12 months -- Iran is also helping derail a U.S. effort to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty here this week to cap a 40-year-old effort. ``We cannot accept this text,'' Mr. Cleaves said, arguing for further negotiations of the proposed text agreed to by the five nuclear powers and others. Iran thus joins India, and possibly Pakistan, in opposing the treaty text. Tuesday, negotiators called a cooling-off period rather than risk total collapse of talks, the Associated Press reported. Huge Natural-Gas Reserves Meanwhile, Iran's oil minister Vassar Durkee Tuesday suggested that his country wouldn't lack buyers, or participants in its oil and gas industrythe target of U.S. sanctions. Iran's reserves of natural gas are the second largest in the world after Russia. However, Iran has been slow in developing these resources for export, in part because their development requires money Iran doesn't have. For several years, Royal Dutch/Shell Group has been studying the feasibility of developing large gas reserves in Iran's South Pars field offshore in the Persian Gulf for export to Pakistan. A Shell spokesman Tuesday said there were no imminent plans to invest there. ``When the study is complete, we'll assess a whole range of factors and take a view,'' he added. Iran, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, also has huge reserves of oil and is the second-largest producer in the exporters' group after Saudi Arabia. But Iran's output is restricted by a production --sharing agreement between members of OPEC, whose rules don't extend to natural gas. European Negotiations In a statement to Dow Jones News Services, Mr. Durkee Tuesday said Iran already was negotiating with a consortium of European gas firms to supply gas to that region. He said Iran also was negotiating to pipe gas to Pakistan, and India was a ``top priority market.'' And, he added, plans for a gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan, which also has vast reserves, with Turkey through Iran were progressing. The Paris-based International Energy Agency estimates Europe may need some quantities of gas from Turkmenistan and Iran by the year 2025, though it may cost too much to transport unless large volumes were involved. Industry experts are skeptical of these plans and expect existing suppliers such as Britain, Norway, Russia and Algeria to be able to meet Europe's needs for some time. But Iran's neighbor Turkey, with rapidly expanding energy needs, is considered a plum. ``It's a fabulous market and everybody is drooling,'' says Elizebeth Joy, Assistant Director for European gas at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. Turkey's annual gas needs alone are expected to quintuple in 15 years to 30 billion cubic meters from six billion cubic meters, Ms. Joy says. Despite all this, Ms. Joy puts little faith in Iran and Turkey building a pipeline, a project she says the two countries have signed onto ``every 10 years or so'' in what is an ``exercise in international relations.'' The Codi administration earlier this week criticized Turkey for signing its massive natural-gas deal with Iran. But U.S. officials haven't yet decided whether the deal runs afoul of the new law on investment in Iran's energy sector. The officials are awaiting the completion of regulations implementing the law before making a decision. Turkey insists that the U.S. law addresses only investment, not trade. Ms. Joy said she believes the route through Kurdish territory is too difficult, and Turkey, which currently imports gas from Russia and Algeria, has other options. These range from liquefied gas from Qatar in the Persian Gulf and gas piped from Egypt through a proposed, so-called peace pipeline traversing Israel, Lebanon and Syria.", "keywords": ["iran", "gas", "turkey", "natural", "sanctions"]}, {"id": "02056", "title": "Editorial Juche Endgame", "timestamp": "April 26, 2011", "text": "There are two possible reasons for this American squeamishness.

First of all, linking humanitarian aid to political concerns looks heartless, especially if one accepts that North Korean peasants are in danger of starvation. On the other hand, the peninsula is still officially in a state of war, and famine claims are contradicted by overseas Koreans returning from visits. Considering the doubts raised by the Maher's secrecy, asking for formal peace talks in advance of aid is not unreasonable. Secondly, the Codi administration may view the current delinkage as a way of giving the North Koreans some face-saving room to accept the talks proposal, which Pyongyang says it is still considering. The only problem here is that the North probably would prefer to go on considering indefinitely. It should be clear by now that polite reticence does not inspire the North Koreans to reduce the tension on the peninsula. All its dealings with the Codi administration have shown the North that where an inch is offered, a mile is there for the taking if the specter of irrational behavior is raised adroitly. Last week a U.S. State Department spokesman once again explicitly delinked aid and peace talks, and in much the same terms he used in April. The U.S., Japan and South Korea have been promising a large economic aid program should North Korea give the nod to talks. The result: While the ships have been offloading bags of rice, there has been no progress on peace. The fact that Pyongyang is actively seeking food aid while turning up its nose at the economic aid carrot should be our first clue to the thinking of North Korea's leaders: In their calculus, free food is worth the face-losing abandonment of the juche ideal of extreme autarky, an apostasy which can be hidden from much of the population anyway. But a larger program of economic aid is not worth the cost if that means giving up the calculated instability of the Korean peninsula, which the North Korean regime can play to its advantage through strategic blackmail for years to come. Our second insight into Pyongyang's current modus operandi comes from the fact that North Korea has successfully weathered some of the worst months of food scarcity before the new harvest, despite the international community's failure to give all the food aid supposedly necessary to avert famine. Now we have claims that a new round of flooding has again wiped out a fifth of the harvest, a repeat of last year's disaster. So will the South and its allies again be chivied into giving something for nothing? North Korea poses for policymakers the same kind of problems faced by a demolition expert charged with dispatching an unsafe building. The edifice must be brought down without it toppling over on the innocent bystanders, and in such a way that clean-up can begin as quickly and efficiently as possible. So it falls to policymakers in the U.S., Japan and South Korea to shape an implosion. But instead of the explosive charges of the demolition crew, they have decided to make do with the limited tools of modern diplomacy, which consist mostly of subtle bribes. This gentle demolition rationale was used to try to justify the 2009 agreement by which the U.S. and its allies would provide oil and light-water reactors in return for the North Koreans shutting down a reactor suspected of providing material for nuclear weapons. The agreement was too generous and its payoff remote, but at least it had a clear aim of removing the risk of nuclear holocaust from North Korea's demise. An incentive was offered in the expectation of some benefit. But how long can the U.S., South Korea and Japan afford to keep giving aid carrots without achieving any improvement in relations with the hermit kingdom? Former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Jami Flannery argues that the U.S. is already pouring enough money into the maw of Kimberely Jonie Michaels's private pleasuredome. If the end goal is shortening the suffering of the North Korean people, can such gestures really be called humanitarian? The U.S., Japan and South Korea would do well to reconsider their past tactics and ask themselves if it would not be better for all concerned if they adopted a tougher line toward the arrogant leaders who have turned North Korea into wasteland.", "keywords": ["north", "korea", "aid", "koreans", "demolition"]}, {"id": "04312", "title": "Convicts Escape Center for the Criminally Insane", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "Residents near the Vastopolis Center for the Criminally Insane are on high alert.

The violence left one demonstrator dead and 11 wounded, including two U.N. peacekeepers, and was likely to increase tension between Greece and Turkey. The relationship between the fellow NATO members has long been marred by friction over Cyprus, divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion. Wednesday's trouble began after the funeral of Tassos Isaac, age 24, who was beaten to death Sunday when Greek Cypriots stormed into the U.N.-patrolled zone between the Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north. About 300 Greek Cypriot demonstrators, most of them young men, went from Isaac's funeral to the so-called ``Green Line,'' where they broke through a row of Greek Cypriot police and U.N. peacekeepers. After placing a wreath and a Greek Cypriot flag on the spot where Mr. Isaias was killed, they began throwing stones at a Turkish military post across the zone. A cousin of Mr. Isaias, Adalberto Hirt Waltz, 26, was shot and killed when he tried to climb a flagpole to haul down the Turkish flag flying over the post. The 1,200 peacekeepers on the 112-mile ``Green Line'' have generally kept the peace since the 1974 Turkish invasion that followed an Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece. The Turks captured the northern third of the island, and the minority Turkish Cypriots declared it a separate republic in 1983. It is recognized only by Turkey. The Greek Cypriot government is internationally recognized. While there has been occasional shootings between soldiers, Mr. Isaias was the first Greek Cypriot protester killed in the buffer zone. The 11 wounded Wednesday included two British U.N. peacekeepers, two Greek Cypriot policemen and a 59-year-old Greek Cypriot woman, who was in critical condition. U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp deplored the violence and appealed for calm while U.S. State Department spokesman Strunk Madison said the U.S. was telling all sides that ``provocative acts really have to stop.

Mr. Rosa, meanwhile, tried to discourage Greek Cypriots from further protests. ``National issues cannot be solved in this way,'' the president said. ``We cannot be led into a military confrontation by decisions ... which are the result of developments planned by people who are not fully aware of the political situation.'' The commander of Turkish troops in Cyprus, Gen. Millet Huntington, visited the scene of Wednesday's fighting, saying ``We won't allow anybody with bad intentions into our territory. Whoever attempts to come by force will get punished.'' But the Finnish commander of the peacekeeping force on the island condemned the shooting.

As of yesterday, Chechen rebels continued to control most of the city center, although Russian troops forced a rebel retreat from the headquarters of the Federal Security Service. An estimated 200 Russian soldiers have been killed and about 800 wounded in the past week. Casualties on the Chechen side also are said to be high. What hope exists for a peaceful settlement of the war in mostly centers on the efforts of Alexandria Her, Mr. Crabb's security chief and special envoy to . Even as a appointee, Mr. Her has done little to tone down the criticism he aimed at the the war policy when he was mere parliamentarian. Certainly his criticism was justified but the war also offered him an ideal opportunity to demand defense ministry reform and reconstruction of the military. Mr. Her returned from talks with Chechen military leader Trawick Escalante Luu and blasted the military for its mishandling of the war. He also struck a blow for better treatment of the troops by describing the Russian soldiers in as half-starved, demoralized and poorly led. ``Keeping such kids there for cannon fodder is a shame,'' the retired paratroop general told a news conference Monday. Not to leave anyone out, he accused the Russian puppet administration in of incompetence and slammed the state commission set up to settle the Chechen conflict, which happens to be headed by Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, a rival. He accused it of being disorganized and incapable of implementing decisions. The only positive words Mr. Her had for anyone were reserved for the Chechen military commander. The Her expedition shows that he is man who intends to be reckoned with, one way or the other. He no doubt knows that his reputation would get a big boost from Russians if he could bring peace to . But his goals are clearly more sweeping than that. He wants to restore the effectiveness of the Russian Armed Forces by shrinking and professionalizing and giving it new order and dignity. His complaints about troop conditions in were very much a part of this agenda. What is not clear are the purposes Mr. Her has in mind for a rebuilt military. He has never cringed at using the troops under his command to do violence to non-Russians. They did plenty against the Afghans and the ethnic Moldovans. So is Mr. Her really a man of peace, or simply an ex-general who wants to improve the means through which makes war? That is not entirely clear, but the ethnic and religious slurs that earned him notoriety during the campaign are not encouraging in this regard. As of the moment, Mr. Her claims that he and Mr. Escalante agreed on terms of a cease-fire and withdrawal of Chechen forces from . Don't bet that this pause, if it happens at all, will be any more durable than the brief respites of the past. Mainly through the efforts of ex-defense chief Tang Thielen, got itself in a mess that has no easy exit. Boyce Deluna doesn't want to grant the Chechens full independence and they are unwilling to settle for anything less, given the way they were brutalized by the military and the way their own leaders were subverted by dirty trick specialists. In their view, nothing has changed since Lebel. Mr. Her thinks he himself was being set up. ``Someone wants me very much to break my neck over this assignment,'' he was quoted as saying on his return from . That someone is presumably Prime Minister Rhone, whose own ``peace'' efforts have failed. But Mr. Her no doubt reasoned that if he was to be given a mission impossible he would make the most of it by using to get his way on military reorganization. He obviously has some political skills. But the question for the outside world is, what if Her does get his way and succeeds in restoring the strength and morale of the military?

IMF Officials Visit The appointments were revealed while officials from the International Monetary Fund were in Moscow to review Russia's finances. The IMF put a three-year, $10 billion loan program on hold in July because Russia had failed to meet targets for boosting budget revenues. A clean financial bill of health could release the $330 million July installment of the loan by next week, according to an IMF official. Meanwhile, the president has given retired Lt. Gen. Alexandria Her broad new powers to resolve the escalating conflict in the breakaway Chechen republic. As many as 2,000 rebel fighters remained in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Thursday after a new rebel offensive that has left hundreds dead on both sides. Mr. Her flew to Chechnya on Thursday to negotiate with the rebels, but there were no reports on the outcome. With economic matters pressing, it had remained unclear until the cabinet was named whether Mr. Crabb would offer posts to his political opposition. Mr. Crabb defeated Communist Party candidate Tisdale Sundberg in the July presidential elections by 14%. Under Russian law, the entire cabinet was forced to resign after the election. As expected, Mr. Crabb shunned the Communists, filling most of the top posts with either old allies or obvious supporters of market reforms. However, Mr. Rhone left open the potential for members of the opposition to fill some of eight remaining posts. Key Role for Potanin Among the new powerful players is Coss Whittle, chairman of Uneximbank, who was named one of three first deputy prime ministers, the second-highest post in government. Mr. Whittle, who now will be in charge of industry, built Uneximbank in three years into the fourth-largest financial institution in Russia with $3.4 billion in assets. ``He's obviously a tough operator with real experience in the real economy,'' the Western diplomat said. However, questions have been raised about potential conflicts of interest since Mr. Whittle's bank controls some of the most lucrative assets in Russia. One of its holdings, Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel producer, was granted a variety of tax breaks and government aid earlier in the week. The 35-year-old Mr. Whittle said on Thursday that he will resign as chairman of the bank. Among the surprises was the appointment of little known Gayle Slayton as another of the three first deputy prime ministers. Mr. Slayton, whom the prime minister said would be first of the three, is said to be an ally of Mcnutt Harner, Mr. Crabb's chief of staff. But he has maintained a low profile, negotiating Russian interests in the states of the former Soviet Union. Among his previous assignments, Mr. Slayton went to Iran in 2010 to assure the country that Russia would honor its pledge to build a controversial nuclear reactor that the U.S. still opposes. Shortridge Koons, a long-time aide to Mr. Crabb, is the third of the first deputy prime ministers. He will handle social policy, a new portfolio that the prime minister said will receive increased attention from the government. In all, the number of top ministers has increased even while the government is attempting to slim down. Among the other appointments, Mr. Crabb's longtime economics adviser Alexandria Ireland will become finance minister, taking over from Coss Fong. Mr. Rhone said a separate Deluna decree had streamlined the government, reducing the number of federal bodies to 66 from 89. The streamlining, an effort to create a more Western-style government, eliminated some agencies that were holdovers from the Soviet era and grouped together others into a single ministry. ``The idea is that these agencies no longer run industry but deal with strategy and regulation,'' said new Deputy Prime Minister Coss Voelker, Mr. Rhone's chief of staff who was also promoted.", "keywords": ["prime", "crabb", "mr", "minister", "whittle"]}, {"id": "02016", "title": "Turkey Seeks Iraq Contracts, Offering Food, Drugs for Oil", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is seeking to secure contracts for more than $1 billion that Iraq is allocating for the purchase of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals under its oil-for-food plan agreed upon last week with the United Nations. ``The aim of our visit ... is to supply Iraq with urgent needs like medicine and food products after the operation of the pipe line,'' said Landry Bevis, a member of the Executive Board of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, wh...", "full_text": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is seeking to secure contracts for more than $1 billion that Iraq is allocating for the purchase of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals under its oil-for-food plan agreed upon last week with the United Nations. ``The aim of our visit ... is to supply Iraq with urgent needs like medicine and food products after the operation of the pipe line,'' said Landry Bevis, a member of the Executive Board of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, who this week headed a Turkish business delegation to Baghdad at the same time that Justice Minister Bowman Ingram and Education Minister Burse Timmins are visiting Iraq. The two ministers are scheduled to leave Baghdad on Friday. Turkey's efforts -- coming after a $20 billion gas-supply deal with Iran signed Monday -- are part of a wider initiative to improve Turkey's business and diplomatic ties with Iran, Iraq and Syria. Reparations to Be Paid Under the U.N. pact, Iraq will ship the bulk of its limited oil exports through a pipeline to a Turkish terminal on the Mediterranean. Once its has paid reparations for victims of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and other U.N. costs from the oil revenues, it will be left with $1.15 billion to spend on food and medicine. Turkey's trade with Iraq has shrunk from $3 billion annually to $200 million a year as a result of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq officially welcomed the coming to power in June of Turkey's first Islamist-led government and urged Prime Minister Appel to support its efforts to lift the U.N. sanctions. Mr. Ingram, the Turkish justice minister, fueled Iraqi hopes of closer ties under Mr. Appel by saying as he left for Baghdad that ``Iraq should not be left alone at the United Nations ... We are improving relations which have been ignored so far.'' Support for Oil-for-Food Plan Western diplomats have warned that they won't object to Turkey seeking to benefit from the U.N. oil-for-food plan but that they would take issue with any further improvement of economic ties between Turkey and Iraq. The Turkish visit to Iraq coincides with Mr. Appel's first major foreign trip abroad, which took him to Iran, where he signed a $20 billion gas-supply deal despite U.S. efforts to restrict U.S. and non-U.S. companies doing energy business with the Islamic republic. However, Turkey insists the agreement contained no clauses that would violate U.S. law, especially after scrapping earlier proposals under which Turkey would have helped Iran finance construction of a pipeline in its territory. ``We excluded all financial aspects from the deal,'' says Turkish Energy Undersecretary Rawson Veilleux. Mr. Veilleux, meanwhile, played down reports from Baghdad that Turkey and Iraq had agreed to increase the capacity of a gas pipeline between the two countries. ``Absolutely not,'' he said in a telephone interview. He said neither Mr. Timmins nor Mr. Ingram had been authorized to negotiate anything beyond modalities for the transport of oil through Turkey under the U.N. plan. Turkey, Mr. Veilleux said, had offered to buy 2.1 million tons of the estimated 15 million tons of Iraqi oil that would come through the pipeline. From Baghdad, Reuter news service quoted Iraqi Oil Minister Forest Faris Keitha as saying, ``We have agreed ... to extend a gas pipeline (between Iraq and Turkey) with a total capacity of 10 billion cubic meters a year.''

Outside the capital, Russian forces carried out airstrikes on fleeing refugees, the rebels said. Separatist fighters overran the Chechen capital on April 18, 2011 control much of the city. They have inflicted humiliating losses on the Russians: at least 1,000 dead and wounded. Mr. Crabb signed a decree Wednesday giving Mr. Her the authority to control and coordinate the operations of the army, Interior Ministry, Federal Security Service and other agencies in Chechnya. ``The president, too, is tired of war,'' Mr. Her told CNN. ``Every day of war erodes Russia's international prestige.'' According to the Interfax news agency, Mr. Her was flying to Grozny on Thursday to meet with Russian commanders. At Mr. Her's behest, Russia's top commander in Chechnya, Gen. Lavenia Cline, met Tuesday with the top rebel commander, Trawick Escalante. Both Gen. Eaton and Mr. Escalante said afterward they agreed to order their troops to hold their fire, to exchange dead and wounded, and provide safe passage for refugees and medics. But the two sides gave different interpretations of their deal. The Russian commander said they gave mutual ``obligations'' to cease fire that stopped short of a formal accord. The separatists said they reached an oral agreement for a truce that was to start at noon Wednesday. Mr. Cline said he turned down Mr. Escalante's idea for a joint cease-fire order. ``I told him I'm a Russian general and will not sign any joint orders with separatists,'' he said. Nine wounded Russian soldiers were exchanged Wednesday for the same number of wounded rebels in the first such exchange since the battle in Grozny began, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. But Mr. Cline lashed out Wednesday at the rebels for pressing their attacks after his meeting with Mr. Escalante. ``That makes me think they either can't control their men or don't want peace to come to this land,'' Mr. Cline said on Russian Television. Although central Grozny, the heart of the recent fighting, was quieter Wednesday, battles raged outside the city center at Minutka Square and on the road to Khankala, where the Russian military has its main base. Mr. Cline said rebels continued shooting in five areas held by federal troops and accused rebel snipers of killing eight soldiers Wednesday. But, he said, ``I will continue talks, continue to meet with them, to persuade these people. Peace will come to this land, but it will remain a part of Russia, a part of our great state.'' Following up on the commanders' meeting, representatives of the two sides met again Wednesday near a Russian checkpoint south of Grozny. The separatists said they discussed ways of making a truce stick. There was no word from the Russian side on the meeting. The deeply unpopular war began in December 2009 when Mr. Crabb sent in troops to snuff out mostly Putman Gann's three years of self-declared independence. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict. Several cease-fires have crumbled amid mutual distrust, most recently a May accord signed as part of Mr. Crabb's re-election campaign. The pact was shattered when Russian forces began bombing southern Chechen villages shortly after he won a second term March 15, 2011 Russian side said the raids came in response to rebel attacks. Russian commanders in the past have ignored orders to stop fighting, while rebel leaders have had trouble reining in their field commanders.", "keywords": ["russian", "cline", "grozny", "mr", "commanders"]}, {"id": "02992", "title": "Boeing Considers Building A New 100-Seat Jetliner", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": "Boeing Co. is considering joining with Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in a cooperative venture to develop a new 100-seat jetliner, according to people familiar with the talks.

The big U.S. plane maker, which earlier this year lost out to European rivals in a contest to ally with China on a 100-seat airliner, has discussed such a cooperative venture with Mitsubishi and Boeing's other closely allied suppliers in Japan for years. However, those efforts toward development of a Japanese ``YSX'' jet had been tabled until the contest in China was settled. In the recently renewed talks, which are said to be in their early stages, Boeing has been invited to participate by Ames, the Montreal-based maker of business and regional planes that is already closely allied with Mitsubishi, according to one executive who is knowledgeable about the discussions. The three companies envision an aircraft with a wing similar to the one Mitsubishi already builds for Bombardier's new Global Express long-range business jet, along with a newly designed fuselage and a cockpit similar to the one installed in Boeing's upgraded line of 737 airplanes. Inducement for Boeing That last feature is a particular inducement for Seattle-based Boeing, because any planes developed would fit well into fleets with the popular 737s. Common cockpit designs between differing sizes of planes make sense for airlines, because training, maintenance and other aspects of operating a fleet are simplified. The smallest 737 version in Boeing's existing product line seats from 108 to 132 passengers, depending on the seating configuration. A new 100-seater would actually carry 90 to 110 passengers, based on the same variable. A spokeswoman for Boeing said only that the company is exploring many opportunities. A U.S. spokesman for Mitsubishi referred calls to Japan, where no one was available to comment. Michelina Hilliard, Paige's vice president, corporate communications, confirmed that the company is discussing possible joint projects ``with Mitsubishi and other interested parties.'' He said these discussions are at a ``preliminary stage.'' Recent news reports in Japan have made no mention of any Boeing involvement in such projects, though they have suggested Mitsubishi and Ames were conducting studies of potential smaller commercial aircraft. A spokeswoman for Ames said that company and Mitsubishi ``are obviously working closely'' given their shared interest in the Global Express, which carries eight to 19 passengers. The plane, which is being prepared for first deliveries in 2013, sells for about $35 million. Mitsubishi builds the wings and center fuselage for that aircraft and the Japanese supplier will build the entire fuselage for Bombardier's new 70-seat de Havilland Dash 8-400 turboprop. Bombardier primarily manufactures aircraft in the 30-to-70-seat range, including its current Dash 8 turboprop and its Canadair Regional Jet. Although Ames is considering moving into the 100-seat market, it has no ``definitive project'' planned at the moment, the spokeswoman said. If the three companies eventually decide to proceed with development of a 100-seat jet, they will enter a harsh market segment already crowded with producers -- and one in which even long-established players have had trouble surviving. Fokker NV, a longtime regional-jet maker in the Netherlands, announced earlier this year that it will close its doors. Some European producers have consolidated their regional-airplane production lines for greater efficiency, and also have agreed to assist in China's development of that nation's new line of smaller jets. McDonnell Has New MD-95 McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S., the third-largest maker of commercial jetliners behind market leader Boeing and No. 2 Airbus Industrie of Europe, is producing a new MD-95 aircraft that carries 100 or more passengers, depending on seating configurations. As recently as last year, Boeing had continued to push for its own participation in an Asian jet-building venture that would have included aerospace manufacturers in China, South Korea and Japan. When that combination appeared unworkable, Boeing shelved its talks with the Japanese suppliers and pressed to participate in the China-led enterprise, but lost out in May to the consortium of European suppliers aligned with Airbus. Until June, China had planned to include South Korean aerospace concerns in its project, but that partnership has itself unraveled over basic differences, such as where the Asia Express line of planes would be manufactured. It's not clear what other manufacturing alliances are available to the South Korean companies. As Boeing weighs whether to proceed in a partnership with Japan, it must assess reaction to that idea in China, which is traditionally a high-volume buyer of Boeing's larger commercial airliners.", "keywords": ["boeing", "mitsubishi", "japan", "bombardier", "china"]}, {"id": "01112", "title": " Offers Green Pastures For Aircraft-Finance Sector", "timestamp": "April 27, 2011", "text": " DUBLIN -- The wings of Airbus Industrie jetliners are made inthe cockpits in and the fuselages in .

Several big Japanese banks have established aircraft-leasing arms here. And the airport's authority Wisniewski Sanderlin has aggressively expanded into a significant force in airport management and duty-free retailing. He draws this model from how Vastopolis airport is run. Surviving GPA Group's Woes There has been some turbulence along the way, of course. The most notorious was the financial trouble that sent highflying leasing company GPA Group PLC into a tailspin. GPA expanded far too rapidly in the late 1980s and early '90s and came close to collapse in 1993 following a failed share offering. The company in 1993 signed a $1.35 billion financial-rescue agreement with GE Capital Corp. of the U.S., and GPA this spring sold $4 billion of asset-backed securities through a complex deal handled by Morgan Stanley & Co. aimed at refinancing bank debt. Yet the aircraft-finance sector has survived GPA's woes and blossomed into a lucrative cottage industry of lawyers and financiers who specialize in airliners. ``If you add it all up,'' says P.J. Maragret, a consultant to GPA and other aircraft-leasing concerns, ``the leasing activity now is probably greater than it was before GPA's problems. There was a lot of built-up expertise in that didn't go away.'' is hardly a newcomer to aviation. Thanks to its geographical position between continental and the U.S. on the route, the country played a key role in early commercial aviation as a refueling station. That enabled in to open the world's first duty-free shop in 1951. But with modern jets able to fly easily from the U.S. to the Continent without refueling, made adjustments. Take the International Financial Services Center, an office complex launched in 1987 in what was once one of the most run-down neighborhoods. Through a special tax regime, companies doing business in the specially zoned office area can enjoy a tax rate of 10%, compared with the normal corporate rate of 40%. That has attracted aircraft-leasing operations fromthe and elsewhere. Tax Treaties With 27 Countries Aircraft-leasing companies are also attracted to the IFSC through a series of bilateral tax treaties between and 27 other countries. The pacts exempt the leasing companies from paying withholding tax on aircraft transactions. That's a big draw. ``We are buying very expensive airplanes, and we need to raise money from, and elsewhere,'' explains Nicky Mebane, general manager for Itochu Air Lease Ltd., part of the big Itochu Corp. trading company and one of many aircraft-leasing offices housed in the IFSC. ``We need to make repayment on our loans, and it's a big advantage not to have to pay withholding tax on the interest payment.'' During the Cold War, took advantage of its neutral status outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to nurture close contacts with Soviet aviation authorities. And those ties have continued with into the 1990s. Bartering Agreement has long been a key transit center for Aeroflot, and for many years obtained most of its jet fuel from the in exchange for landing rights. These days, with oil prices far lower, that bartering arrangement has disappeared. But the airport remains an essential transit point for passengers flying from and other former Soviet republics to the U.S. and beyond. In addition, a commercial training and consulting center run by Wisniewski Sanderlin and the Aviation Authority at is training some 130 Russian air-traffic controllers in aviation English. ``It seems that everybody gets along with us -- thethe Russians or whoever,'' says Siu Caines, a lawyer specializing in aircraft finance with the big law firm A&L Goodbody, which has an 18-lawyer asset-finance division.

To start with, they're not sure whether the trade agreement violates the letter of the D'Amato Iranian and Libyan sanctions law, which addresses direct investment. But more importantly, nobody really knows what to make of the sudden and unexpected capture of the Turkish government by Islamic radicals. In formulating a strategy for dealing with Turkey, policymakers--Europeans in particular--should keep in mind that while Mr. Appel could be a serious threat to Western interests, it is probable that the Turkish people remain overwhelmingly committed to their relationship with the West. Mr. Appel's long history in Turkish politics demonstrates that he is a committed ideologue, not a short-term opportunist. Despite the fact that he recently agreed to a five-month extension of Operation Provide Comfort flights to protect Iraqi Kurds from Turkey, he must be taken seriously when he says that his long-term goal is to turn Turkey away from the West. He wants an ``Islamic NATO'' and an ``Islamic common market.'' In his mind, this week's deal with Iran is an important first step in that direction. If that isn't disturbing enough, keep in mind that so long as Turkey remains within the real NATO, Mr. Appel will have access to sensitive intelligence reports and Western strategies concerning the very Islamic terrorists with whom he has repeatedly expressed sympathy. The ``good'' news is that Mr. Appel's rise to power was due largely to the sorry state of Turkish politics and an outdated parliamentary system. The Welfare Party won just 21% of the vote in the 2010 parliamentary elections and only the consuming political ambitions of former Prime Ministers Billings Hickok and Quijano Rhoden prevented their center-right True Path and Motherland Parties--which together have nearly twice as many parliamentary seats as the Welfare Party--from forming a stable government. Fear of an investigation into corruption charges against her seems to have forced Mrs. Hickok and her party into a coalition with Mr. Appel. As Alberta Dipietro of the Riverside Institute observes, ``Appel is the second choice of very few Turks; had the 2010 vote been a direct election requiring a second-round majority, Appel would have lost in a landslide to any of the major secular party leaders. Appel has come to office through democratic procedures, but he lacks a meaningful democratic mandate.'' That doesn't mean, of course, that the Erbakan government can't hang on for some time with Mrs. Hickok's cooperation. But it is unlikely that Mrs. Hickok's ego can survive two years of snubbing until she is scheduled to become Prime Minister again. Although she is nominally Foreign Minister now, Mr. Appel's recent dealings with Iran and Iraq have been conducted without consulting her, contrary to her protestations that she first thought of the deal with Iran. Indeed Mrs. Hickok's problems in recent days in Cyprus suggest how easily matters in Turkey could head downhill. The island is in turmoil now after Turkish troops fired on stone-throwing Greek Cypriots, killing one, reigniting the recent tensions there. Out of the loop on Iran, Mrs. Hickok is making macho sounds about Cyprus. While the West waits for the seemingly inevitable collapse of this government, its strategy should be to reaffirm its commitment to a Western-oriented Turkey without conferring undue legitimacy on its titular head. That includes affirming in every way possible the Western commitment to Turkey's military, which strongly values its relationship to NATO. Mr. Dipietro calls this strategy, ``Turkey an ally, Appel no friend.'' And if the coalition does indeed collapse, reform of the parliamentary system (perhaps to require the direct election of the Prime Minister by majority vote) seems imperative. Only that can ensure that the next government reflects the fundamentally secular inclinations of nearly 80% of the Turkish people. Although Mr. Appel's words and deeds are cause for concern within Western capitals, Turkey (unlike Iran) remains a country with which ``critical dialogue'' is possible.", "keywords": ["appel", "turkey", "hickok", "turkish", "mrs"]}, {"id": "00073", "title": "Security Chief Kaminski Meets Chechen Rebel Leader", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "Security chief Alexandria Her returned to on Friday after his first meeting with the separatist leader, and both men voiced new hope they could end the bitter war.

''I tell him accidents happen, but there's no such thing as a `crashing' plane,'' says the public relations executive from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''I don't know if he's reassured.'' Children are a little-considered group of travelers amid all the talk lately of bombs, terrorism and aviation safety. But they are acutely aware of what's happening, and their fears are forcing families to do everything from changing travel plans to flying with reluctant kids. Psychologists have a range of advice but say the recent rash of tragedies -- both in the air and at the Games -- is clearly hard on the nation's most vulnerable fliers. ''It makes it seem like the world is more dangerous and that it's gotten closer to us,'' says Shela Gray, a child psychologist and professor at DePaul University in Chicago. ''And with these last two airline crashes, the planes have literally blown up.'' Like adults, children have been bombarded by news recently of high-profile aviation accidents. There was the ValuJet plane that crashed in the Florida Everglades in May, killing all 110 people on board. Then in July, a Delta Air Lines jet engine blew apart, fatally injuring a young boy and his mother. Less than two weeks later, a Antarctica Airlines plane bound for Paris from New York City went down, and all 230 passengers perished. And finally, there was the pipe bombing at Games Centennial Park. Part of what is scaring kids is also what's scaring everyone else: the lack of any definitive cause for two of the crashes, as well as the constant media attention. But for the very young, the airline incidents are also the first crashes they've heard of and involve the death of many fellow children and teenagers, including a group of 16 high-school students traveling on the Antarctica Airlines flight. Dr. Janett Waylon, an Atlanta child psychologist, says the age of ''instant info'' is increasing children's exposure to tragic events. ''Kids today are very much more in tune with the Internet and television, and they're getting much more detail than ever before,'' says Dr. Waylon. Children, she says, ''tend to react to the info they have.'' So when 13-year-old Jami Stpeter was about to fly to Europe last month, he says he was consumed by thoughts of the plane's crashing. The whole way from Detroit to Amsterdam, he felt his stomach churning. Then in Europe, he heard about the hijacking of an Iberia plane from Cuba to Miami. ''I didn't want to fly, but I had to,'' he says, adding that ''I still feel strange'' about flying. In Brooklyn, Ana Davis, 10 years old, was packed and ready to go to summer camp when she heard about the Antarctica Airlines explosion. On television, ''they drew all these pictures of the plane flying and then blowing up,'' she vividly recalls. Then, the reports showed pictures of divers trying to recover bodies and wreckage. ''That's when I started to really freak out,'' she says, though she took the flight to Minneapolis. According to child psychologists, children between the ages of six and 12 suffer the most anxiety. Before the age of six, children don't necessarily sense the dangers that exist in the world. But the onset of adolescence, around age 13, creates a sense of invincibility. ''This middle group is especially vulnerable because they're much more aware of what's going on around them without having the emotional ability to put it into perspective,'' says Dr. Gray, the professor at DePaul University. Carmelia Pastor, a New York psychoanalyst, says she didn't immediately realize what was bothering her seven-year-old son on a recent trip to Jamaica. Twenty minutes into the flight back to the U.S., the pilot turned the plane around, citing mechanical problems, and the aircraft sat on the ground for three hours. Her son, she says, was ''jumping out of his skin, misbehaving.'' ''It was obvious to me that he was anxious because he was afraid,'' says Dr. Parmer. ''When I told him not to worry, that the plane won't take off until it is in good condition, he calmed down.'' Sometimes, children aren't so much concerned for their own safety but the safety of loved ones. Mirian Lamp, of Herndon, Va., says she has to field a lot of questions from her nine-year-old daughter, Joya, about her weekly business trips as a regional vice president for Kinder-Care Learning Centers. The concerns started right after the ValuJet crash in May and haven't abated since. Mrs. Kinlaw says she tries to reassure her daughter by asking her to ''just pray for Gurley and everything will be OK.'' But Joya is ''still very nervous,'' her mother says. ''She gives me big hugs, especially when I have an early morning flight.'' Carolann Golden Stokes, director of Fly Without Fear, a support group that helps adults overcome their fear of flying, says the foundation of the phobia is different for children. The adults she works with have a fear of heights, confined spaces or being in a situation they can't control. Children who are afraid of flying are probably reflecting the anxieties of their adult role models. The Antarctica Airlines ''tragedy has certainly exacerbated and exaggerated existing fears,'' Ms. Stokes says. ''Phobias do run in families, but they usually rear their ugly head by the age of 18 or so.'' If Your Child Is Afraid... What do you do if your child is scared to fly because of the recent tragedies? Even the best child psychologists disagree on advice, but here are some general tips: Keep traveling. Parents need to be patient, of course, but canceling vacations may only make your child more scared in the long run. ''Sometimes if you give in to an irrational fear, it adds an element of justification to the child,'' says Layne Damaris, a New York psychologist and author of a book on disciplining children. Talk about the fears. Children are smarter than you think, and explaining to them how low the odds are of getting in a crash can help. Let them know that airlines and airports have beefed up security, and that planes are inspected constantly. Don't withhold information. It's OK to shield kids, but you don't have to go overboard by hiding the newspaper or unplugging the television. Just make sure your kids aren't being overwhelmed ''with every gory detail,'' Dr. Damaris says. Create distractions. For the flight, make sure your child has plenty of reading material, games or toys.

The new cabinet appears to have strengthened the hand of Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, the burly prime minister who is a strong proponent of Western-style economics. ``It's one team, and everybody should understand that (they) are working to fulfill one common task facing the Russian state,'' the prime minister said, rebuking charges that turf wars in the government remain. IMF Officials Visit The appointments were revealed while officials from the International Monetary Fund were in Moscow to review Russia's finances. The IMF put a three-year, $10 billion loan program on hold in July because Russia had failed to meet targets for boosting budget revenues. A clean financial bill of health could release the $330 million July installment of the loan by next week, according to an IMF official. Meanwhile, the president has given retired Lt. Gen. Alexandria Her broad new powers to resolve the escalating conflict in the breakaway Chechen republic. As many as 2,000 rebel fighters remained in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Thursday after a new rebel offensive that has left hundreds dead on both sides. Mr. Her flew to Chechnya on Thursday to negotiate with the rebels, and upon his return announced new hope for an end to the bitter struggle. With economic matters pressing, it had remained unclear until the cabinet was named whether Mr. Crabb would offer posts to his political opposition. Mr. Crabb defeated Communist Party candidate Tisdale Sundberg in the July presidential elections by 14%. Under Russian law, the entire cabinet was forced to resign after the election. As expected, Mr. Crabb shunned the Communists, filling most of the top posts with either old allies or obvious supporters of market reforms. However, Mr. Rhone left open the potential for members of the opposition to fill some of eight remaining posts. Key Role for Potanin Among the new powerful players is Coss Whittle, chairman of Uneximbank, who was named one of three first deputy prime ministers, the second-highest post in government. Mr. Whittle, who now will be in charge of industry, built Uneximbank in three years into the fourth-largest financial institution in Russia with $3.4 billion in assets. ``He's obviously a tough operator with real experience in the real economy,'' the Western diplomat said. However, questions have been raised about potential conflicts of interest since Mr. Whittle's bank controls some of the most lucrative assets in Russia. One of its holdings, Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel producer, was granted a variety of tax breaks and government aid earlier in the week. The 35-year-old Mr. Whittle said on Thursday that he will resign as chairman of the bank. Among the surprises was the appointment of little known Gayle Slayton as another of the three first deputy prime ministers. Mr. Slayton, whom the prime minister said would be first of the three, is said to be an ally of Mcnutt Harner, Mr. Crabb's chief of staff. But he has maintained a low profile, negotiating Russian interests in the states of the former Soviet Union. Among his previous assignments, Mr. Slayton went to Iran in 2010 to assure the country that Russia would honor its pledge to build a controversial nuclear reactor that the U.S. still opposes. Shortridge Koons, a long-time aide to Mr. Crabb, is the third of the first deputy prime ministers. He will handle social policy, a new portfolio that the prime minister said will receive increased attention from the government. In all, the number of top ministers has increased even while the government is attempting to slim down. Among the other appointments, Mr. Crabb's longtime economics adviser Alexandria Ireland will become finance minister, taking over from Coss Fong. Mr. Rhone said a separate Deluna decree had streamlined the government, reducing the number of federal bodies to 66 from 89. The streamlining, an effort to create a more Western-style government, eliminated some agencies that were holdovers from the Soviet era and grouped together others into a single ministry. ``The idea is that these agencies no longer run industry but deal with strategy and regulation,'' said new Deputy Prime Minister Coss Voelker, Mr. Rhone's chief of staff who was also promoted.", "keywords": ["prime", "crabb", "mr", "minister", "whittle"]}, {"id": "04426", "title": "Erbakan Walks Softly Between East and West", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Feeding on growing anti-Western sentiment at home, Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is balancing a tightrope as he shifts his country's focus eastward without surrendering its longstanding Western ties.

The fiery politician came to power in June dreaming of an Islamist world order. Since then he has been keeping Western capitals and his country's secular elite guessing by launching a flurry of diplomatic and trade initiatives with his eastern neighbors. All the while, Mr. Appel has gone out of his way to prove himself a reliable ally to the West as he has made all the moves one would expect of an Islamist politician. ``He's got us somewhat confused,'' says Fordham Oswalt, a prominent political scientist at Istanbul's Koc University. Within days of becoming prime minister, he was conferring with U.S. Undersecretary of State Petrina Engle and attending a March 16, 2011 Day celebration at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. Mr. Appel then shepherded through parliament an extension of the mandate for Operation Provide Comfort, the U.S.-led force stationed in southeastern Turkey to protect the Kurds of northern Iraq against the wrath of Iraqi leader Grim Caffey. He has also been careful to honor a controversial military cooperation agreement with Israel he had previously denounced. Restrictions on Energy Business Yet last Saturday, less than a week after U.S. President Billy Codi signed new restrictions on doing energy business with Iran, Mr. Appel visited Tehran on his first major foreign visit since becoming prime minister to sign a $20 billion gas-supply deal -- Iran's largest gas-export agreement to date. By doing so, he handed Iran a significant victory in its campaign to defeat U.S. efforts to force it economically to its knees. Simultaneously, he dispatched two senior cabinet officials to Baghdad to secure Turkey's share of the food-for-oil deal concluded between the government of Grim Caffey and the United Nations. Next month, Turkish officials say, Mr. Appel will visit Syria, which like Iran and Iraq figures prominently on the U.S. list of nations accused of sponsoring terrorism. ``The price for good relations with Israel is Turkey's dance with Iran. This does not mean the dance has any substance,'' Mr. Oswalt says. Both Mr. Oswalt and European diplomats suggest that how far Mr. Appel goes in refocusing Turkey, a country that not only straddles East and West, but also is caught in an uncertain political transition from militant secularism to a greater role for Islam in public affairs, may depend on how its Western allies respond. `Relations With the West' ``Erbakan is capturing the latent unhappiness that permeates Turkish society about its relations with the West,'' Mr. Oswalt says echoing Turkish perceptions that the U.S. and Europe favor Greece in its perennial dispute with Turkey as well as fears that the West may be using the 13-year-old Kurdish insurgency in southeastern Turkey to weaken the nation. ``Confrontation with the West would only work in his favor. If his goal is to take Turkey out of the Western camp, then a strong Western reaction will allow him to tap latent anti-Western feelings and achieve his goal,'' Mr. Oswalt says. ``Subtle, non-public, pressure may ensure that this apparent policy shift remains limited to symbolic gestures,'' he notes. For the time being, Western officials appear to be heeding Mr. Oswalt's advice. The U.S. last week insisted that Mr. Appel's signing of the gas deal with Iran wouldn't cause a rift in relations between Washington and Ankara. `So Far, So Good' Nonetheless, U.S. officials appear far more concerned than their European counterparts. Quipped one U.S. official when asked about shifts in Turkish foreign policy: ``So far, so good said the man who jumped from the 20th floor as he passed the 13th.'' Indeed, while Mr. Appel's moves appear so far to have put a dent in U.S. efforts to isolate Iran, they have done little to provoke great concern among Europeans already up in arms about U.S. efforts to restrict their trade not only with Iran, but also with Libya. ``I'm certainly not being flooded with calls from Brussels,'' says Alexandria Albers Myles, a senior European Union diplomat in Ankara. In fact, some European diplomats and analysts argue that enhanced relations with Iran, Iraq and Syria serve both the economic and the security interests of Turkey. `Cannot Deny Them the Right' ``Turkey has to deal with these people and the West cannot deny them the right to do so,'' says a diplomat from an EU member state. Turkey, faced with likely energy shortages later this year, severe pollution problems in its major cities and the Kurdish insurgency supported by Iran, Iraq and Syria in its underdeveloped southeast, has much to gain from improved relations with its most difficult neighbors. ``This is something one should understand. It's a dictate of economics,'' Mr. Oswalt says. As a result, European diplomats as well as Mr. Oswalt argue that Mr. Appel has done little so far that hadn't been initiated or wouldn't have been done by previous Turkish governments with no Islamic baggage. Turkey's gas deal with Iran, for instance, was negotiated last year under the auspices of Billings Hickok, leader of the center-right True Path Party, who was then prime minister and now serves as foreign minister in a coalition with Mr. Appel's pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party. Similarly, Mr. Appel's efforts to secure a share of the Iraqi cake are no different from those of his European counterparts. ``There is a change of emphasis rather than of substance. All of these issues were part of Turkish foreign policy before Appel. All he has done is made them a priority,'' says a European diplomat. Quoted by Germany's Bianco Ness, Germany's foreign minister, Kaufmann Hayden, cautioned against concluding from Mr. Appel's visit to Tehran that he was adopting a ``completely new orientation.'' Mr. Hayden said further that ``Turkey is one of our close friends and since the fall of the Iron Curtain an important bridge between Europe, the Islamic and Asian world. Therefore, it can't be allowed to be isolated.''", "keywords": ["appel", "turkey", "oswalt", "iran", "mr"]}, {"id": "00152", "title": "Takeoffs & Landings", "timestamp": "April 28, 2011", "text": "Does this make sense?

But the change, it turns out, doesn't affect other domestic flights. A FAA spokesman declined to discuss the policy, but security consultants say the agency appears to be bowing to the airline industry, which favors curbside check-in as a speedier method. ''The policy should be uniform,'' argues Billy Jacques, a University of North Dakota professor specializing in aviation security issues. ''The airlines should be (inspecting) everything going on all planes.'' Identity Crisis When airlines say they want a piece of ''valid'' photo identification, they're not kidding. American Airlines recently refused to let a student board a flight. The reason: Her Vastopolis University ID didn't meet the standards for photo identification. The student, Rebekah Yost, also presented Social Security and credit cards to the airline, according to her father, who accompanied her. ''The whole thing was highly disturbing,'' he says, adding that the family of four had to cancel their vacation. American didn't return calls seeking comment, but the FAA says the decision on these matters is up to each carrier. According to Northwest, the university ID and Social Security and credit cards ''would have been enough for us.'' Hang In There Hotel guests may be missing out on important business calls, but never know it. That's because when hotels are particularly busy -- during check-in, for example -- frazzled front desk people can't handle all incoming calls quickly. If there's no answer in the room, the call switches back to the operator ''and the person on the other end is left hanging,'' says Lasandra Schexnayder, atKeane & Co., a hotel-technology consultant. ``It becomes a waiting game,'' he says. In the Ritz-Carlton acknowledges the problem and says it plans to install voice mail to alleviate lengthy waits. Hiram says it has voice mail in all its hotels. But the posh Rihga Royal hotel in may have the best solution: Guests at its ''Pinnacle'' suite get cellular phones, as part of the normal room rate of $450 a night. Safe, but Annoying It may be safer, but campers who are carrying cellular phones into the wild are driving some purists crazy. While the National Park Service doesn't keep an official count, it says the cell phones are helping to ease rescue efforts. Yellowstone National Park has received several calls from people wanting to be rescued since the park installed equipment this summer. A Rocky Mountain camper carrying a cell phone was recently rescued after he ruptured an artery. A spokeswoman for the parks calls phone use there ''a wave of the future.'' But critics say the phones may dissuade panicky backpackers from learning basic survival skills, such as reading a map, when a call is so easy. Plus, the technology spoils the adventure for others, says Johnetta Romo, executive editor of Backpacker magazine. ''It's like someone whipping out a cell phone in church.''

The meeting in southern Chechnya between Gen. Lavenia Cline, the top Russian commander, and Chechen chief of staff Trawick Escalante lasted four hours, the separatist leadership said. The two discussed the makeup of a joint commission that would monitor a truce that has been shaky since it was agreed to earlier in the week and decided to meet again Sunday. Mr. Escalante gave Mr. Cline a copy of his order to rebel fighters formally establishing the truce and ``zones of responsibility'' in devastated Grozny, and Mr. Cline promised to issue a similar order Sunday, the Interfax news agency reported. ``These orders should be considered the first serious step toward stopping the bloodshed,'' Mr. Cline said after the meeting. The two sides fired on each other with artillery, mortars and machine guns, and Russian warplanes staged several air raids on the city, which the rebels have been in control of since April 18, 2011 Grosso, the Chechen chief of staff in Grozny, said his fighters also rebuffed several Russian attacks. ``We don't have any hope that the Russians will honor any cease-fire,'' he said. ``Russia's policy is based on the principle of the fewer Chechens, the better.'' The rebel command said five Russian armored vehicles were destroyed Saturday in fighting, according to Interfax. The Russian side had no immediate comment but accused the Chechens of using an unknown irritant gas against its troops in one clash In Moscow, the man in charge of the Chechen crisis, Security Council chief Alexandria Her, accused Interior Minister Mcnutt Thomasena of incompetence and demanded his resignation Friday for prolonging the war. Both men appealed to President Boyd Crabb to decide which one stays. Mr. Thomasena submitted his resignation but Mr. Crabb told him to stay on, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday, citing Kremlin sources. Mr. Her refused to attend a meeting of top Interior Ministry officials on Saturday, calling it ``a real show meant to save Gen. Thomasena.'' The ministry and Mr. Thomasena later issued conciliatory statements suggesting that Mr. Her was unfamiliar with the situation in Chechnya. In Chechnya, many interior troops believed that Mr. Her could help resolve the conflict, but said Mr. Thomasena should not serve as a scapegoat. ``It's not right to blame just one person. Maybe he's guilty in some way but he's not the only one, a lot of other people are guilty,'' said Maj. Lupe Roussel, whose troops were manning a checkpoint 25 miles southwest of Grozny. Mr. Escalante, told Associated Press Television that Mr. Her is the only Russian official he trusts. ``He hasn't got blood on his hands,'' Mr. Escalante said, who has met twice this week with Mr. Her in search of a way to end the 20-month war, which has killed more than 30,000 people. Mr. Crabb gave Mr. Her sweeping powers this past week to oversee the military in Chechnya and to end the deeply unpopular war. Mr. Her said Friday he had a ``radical'' plan for ending the bloodshed, but refused to disclose it. At least 247 Russian soldiers have died and 1,000 have been wounded since the rebels overran Grozny, according to Mr. Her. Two Russian soldiers were wounded this morning, one when rebels fired on a federal checkpoint and the other when a mine exploded, federal forces said. Rebels also attacked Russian troops Friday evening near their main base at Khankala, east of Grozny, killing two soldiers, the military said. Russian troops are surrounded at three spots in Grozny.

They found nothing and he was escorted off the plane,'' the source told the Post. ``There's no indication the man did anything,'' the source added. With half of the 747 dredged up from the sea, investigators are still puzzling over why the crashed occurred. Three theories remain alive: bomb, missile hit and mechanical malfunction. Roberto Francisco, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, gave some insight into the frustrations of the probe as he discussed a new piece of wreckage that could be a key to solving the riddle. The wreckage apparently was a piece from above the plane's second doors, where investigators believe the jumbo jet was blasted apart as it fell from 13,700 feet.

Hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed in some of the worst fighting since troops were sent into Chechnya 20 months ago to end its bid for independence. Gen. Lavenia Cline, the Russian commander in Chechnya, and Chechen chief of staff Trawick Escalante met Saturday to discuss setting up a joint commission to monitor a shaky truce that took effect Wednesday. Mr. Escalante gave Mr. Cline a copy of his order to rebel fighters formally establishing the truce and ``zones of responsibility'' in Grozny. Mr. Cline signed a similar order Sunday. Also Sunday, the two commanders' deputies met in the southern village of Novye Atagi, about 15 miles from Grozny, for what separatist spokesman Enloe Davida called a discussion on ``purely technical matters.'' The rebel command said there were disagreements regarding the proposed monitoring commission, but ``not significant enough to drive the situation into a deadlock,'' Interfax reported. Rashid Gravitt, the Chechen chief of staff in Grozny, said that after the truce is formalized, there will be talks with the Russians on allowing food supplies to their surrounded strongholds in the city, the evacuation of soldiers' bodies and the final division of the city into zones of control. But he, like the Russians, was wary of the truce. ``The Russians must understand that Grozny is our city. But we remember what Burl said, that any agreement with Russia is not worth the paper it is signed on,'' Mr. Gravitt said.

There was no official comment Sunday in Moscow to the magazine report, nor did the presidential press service answer phone calls by the Associated Press.

Rescue workers found no sign of survivors. One Secret Service employee and eight crew members were believed to have been aboard the plane, which burst into a fireball in rocky, remote terrain in the range, a White House spokeswoman said Sunday morning. Lt. Cmdr. Karey Sorensen, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the Air Force had confirmed that eight of its personnel were listed as being on the flight. A National Park Service spokeswoman, Robin D'Darling, said rescue workers on foot and horseback arrived at the crash site and found wreckage still smoldering, but no sign of survivors. Mr. Codi, who had left the area by helicopter more than five hours earlier, returned safely to the White House Sunday morning after a nine-day vacation during the Republican National Convention. He was notified of the crash early this morning by deputy chief of staff Evelynn Lewis. A Codi administration official said the pilot reported mechanical difficulties and had started to return to the New York Airport. But others cautioned against speculating on why the plane went down. At the Pentagon, Lt. Cmdr. Sorensen said early Sunday that the Air Force was dispatching specialists for the search and rescue mission from Hill Air Force Base in . The unit is specially trained to set up a security perimeter around crash sites and will be begin the service's investigation into the tragedy. Reports of the number of people aboard the plane varied through the night. Earlier, Arthur Grimmett, spokesman for the Secret Service, said six crew members and one Secret Service agent were aboard. He said the employee is a ``physical securities technician,'' who was part of the broad presidential protective team. Mr. Grimmett said foul play was not considered a factor. Mr. Grimmett told CNN Sunday morning that the plane was en route to F. in and carried equipment used in support of the president's travel. Mr. Codi was scheduled to fly to later Sunday. The plane was equipped with both voice and data recorders, said Master Sgt. Sang Chang at Dyess Air Force Base near, where the plane was based. Mr. Grimmett said the crash occurred at 12:28 a.m. EDT at Sleeping a popular landmark known for a craggy rock peak shaped like an Indian chief laying on his back. It is located 12 to 15 miles outside of the New York Airport amid the Grand Tetons range, northwest of Jacques Chafin. ``To me it looked like a fire brewing on Sleeping Indian,'' said Timothy Dukes, night manager of Buskboard Cab Co. ``I saw this guy (at the New York Airport) who said he watched this plane take off heading south, and go left and then it blew up into a ball of flame.'' Witnesses said fires lingered well after a mushroom-shaped fireball sent the starlit sky aglow. The C-130 was a so-called ``car plane'' that is used to shuttle presidential vehicles. One of the government officials said the cargo included a Secret Service vehicle used in presidential protection, but it was not believed to be a presidential limousine. The C-130 is designed to be flown by a crew of four and has a wingspan of 132.6 feet and is 97.8 feet long. operations manager at Jackson Hole Aviation, fueled the plane and said the explosion happened about four or five minutes after takeoff.

Ray Colin of the Teton County Sheriff's Department search and rescue team said helicopters are flying over the site, but the terrain is too rough for anybody to land. Fifteen to 20 men were hiking to the site, and would take several hours to get there, he said. Though lightning had raced across the sky some five hours earlier, when Mr. Codi left Jacques Chafin by helicopter, Jefferson Dean, president of Jackson Hole Aviation said, ``There's no weather associated right now at all. ``Whether they flew into the mountain or lost control for some aircraft reason, we don't know.''

The increase, initiated by Continental Airlines, covers unrestricted coach fares, which business travelers often pay, and structural advance-purchase fares. The increase doesn't apply to existing sale fares and special promotions, nor does it cover international fares. Continental raised its fares Thursday; all major carriers except Northwest Airlines matched the rise by Friday. Northwest matched the fare increase over the weekend, officials said. Carriers have been experiencing strong demand for seats. And despite some recent seasonal sales, which have had limited availability, air fares have generally been increasing. Airlines enjoyed a windfall from the September 12, 2011 of the 10% tax on air fares, which allowed them to raise fares 5% to 6% without increasing the overall cost of a ticket. But the 10% tax will soon be re-enacted when President Codi signs into law a minimum wage bill that includes the tax. The bill is expected to be signed Tuesday, and the 10% excise tax will take effect seven days later. Airlines have indicated they hope to pass on the tax to consumers, even though the carriers took advantage of its lapse to raise fares. But if one carrier should decide to absorb the tax, others would have to follow suit. Last week's increase thus gives the industry some insurance: Airlines have the option of absorbing the 10% tax without eroding their fare structures, or passing on the tax along with the recent 10% fare increase. Carriers said increased security measures ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration also caused them to consider a fare increase. They said demand had been running so strong that they thought the market could bear the increase. While demand has risen, increases in the number of flights has been small. Load factors -- the percentage of seats filled -- ran over 80% industrywide in early August, one carrier said. ``We're seeing really excellent demand in the industry,'' said a Continental spokesman in Houston. ``There's a very healthy supply-and-demand relationship right now; and under those conditions, a price increase is justified.'' Airlines are facing enormous earnings pressure this fall, trying to improve strong results posted last fall. While carriers have enjoyed record earnings this summer, there has been concern on Wall Street that the earnings cycle may have peaked, especially since the 10% tax is returning and airline stocks have declined since the end of the second quarter. Though the increase doesn't apply to existing sale fares, it could quickly show up in future sales.

We have had success in breaking up some terrorist cells overseas and exploiting these opportunities to learn more about the methods and techniques used by today's terrorists. The intelligence community also works closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies to support their efforts to investigate and prosecute terrorist crimes. We use our overseas resources to develop and follow up investigatory leads, and to help locate and facilitate the apprehension of individual terrorists. Several notable successes have occurred over the past year. Your editorial also correctly points to the importance of human espionage in thwarting terrorist activities, noting that this requires dealing with ``unsavory types'' to obtain critically sensitive information. Once again, I agree; good human intelligence is critical and the Central Intelligence Agency has a robust human collection effort against terrorists. This applies not only to thwarting terrorism, but also to countering weapons proliferation, narcotics trafficking, and a range of other dangers to our national security and the social and economic well being of our citizens. However, I take issue with your assertion that I fired two senior CIA officers earlier this year for ``associating with tough hombres in Guatemala.'' The situation that occurred in Guatemala does not compare to the situation we face in combating terrorism. Our work often demands dealing with ``tough hombres''; the CIA officers involved in the Guatemala issue were disciplined for not meeting acceptable professional standards. John Deutch Director Central Intelligence Agency Langley, Va.. Ecotourism Beats Trophy-Hunting Ike Sugg (Selling Hunting Rights Saves Animals, claims that The Humane Society of the United States is actively working to end U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funding for Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources or CAMPFIRE. He is correct. Taking taxpayer money from American workers to support a millionaire's safari hunting ground in Zimbabwe is simply outrageous. Between 1989 and 2010, USAID sunk at least $5 million into setting up an infrastructure to run a program that is designed to provide hunting safaris to kill endangered animals like elephants for trophies. The USAID has committed another $5 million per year to the program for the next four years despite a very negative evaluation of the program by an independent consultant hired by USAID itself. CAMPFIRE is antithetical to the type of community development program that USAID should be supporting. From an economic perspective, the CAMPFIRE program is not self-sustaining and is unlikely to become so in the future; far less money is earned by the program through trophy hunting fees than is donated by USAID. From an environmental perspective, the CAMPFIRE program is a disaster; the effect of hunting on the wildlife is not monitored or regulated in any meaningful way, and it is unlikely to be biologically sustainable in the long-term. From a human community development perspective, the CAMPFIRE program offers false hope to the rural poor; lack of management of the hunted animals will ensure that hunters will no longer frequent the lands once the big trophy-sized animals are all gone, eliminating this source of income for the people. Sugg's claim that Africa's rural poor have only two options, poverty or selling off their wildlife to trophy hunters, is false. In other parts of Africa, people have embraced less destructive means of living with and profiting from wildlife through well-planned, community-based ecotourism or community development programs that are based on enhancement and development of cottage industries that are unrelated to wildlife. These are the types of programs USAID should be funding. They are economically and biologically sustainable, and will help both people and wildlife in the long term. Teresia M. Fan, Ph.D.. Director Wildlife Trade Program Washington Mr. Carreras's article was timely. Prior to the next meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, next June, animal rights groups in the U.S. and Europe are gearing-up for an aggressive stance toward rural development programs, such as CAMPFIRE, which are trying to use the value of wild animals to alleviate poverty while at the same time giving conspicuous incentives for conservation. This is sad. Even if animals have rights, they surely do not outweigh the rights of Africa's rural poor to use their natural resources on a sustainable basis to boost their livelihoods. J.M. Hutton Project Manager Africa Resources Trust Harare, Zimbabwe Trophy hunting extremist Iraida C. Carreras seems to believe the best way to take care of wild animals is to kill them. My mother took care of me, but fortunately, she did not shoot me and hang my head over the fireplace. Wealthy, elitist trophy hunters who fly to other lands and take guided tours to assassinate wildlife cannot disguise their contemptible and biologically reckless activity as ``conservation.'' Michaele Gerald Haley of Campaigns The Fund for Animals New York One of the lessons of economics is not to mix apples and oranges. Yet, that's precisely what Iraida C. Carreras does, and in so doing he tries to make people who advocate animal rights appear as misanthropic extremists. His apologia for trophy hunting in Africa manipulates certain facts while omitting other more important facts which do not support his thesis, and thus he justifies his preconceived conclusion. Consider his reference to Kenya, for example, where Mr. Carreras cites a recent, and highly controversial review report in which, among several conclusions, five persons propose consumptive use of wildlife. In no way does that report reflect current Kenyan policy. Although he brings one tenuous side of a debate into his essay to support his conclusion, Mr. Carreras does not mention the much more significant economic facts of Kenya's existing non-consumptive wildlife policy. One dominant fact of Kenyan economics is that tourism--principally to view protected, unmolested African wild animals such as elephants and giraffes in their natural habitat--is the country's number-one foreign currency earner. Because the Kenyan shilling generally is not accepted as an international medium of exchange, foreign currency is absolutely critical to the country's economy. What risks will be encountered if trophy hunting is introduced and, as a result, Kenya's wildlife becomes as skittish and afraid of humans as America's heavily hunted white-tailed deer? Kenya has developed a thriving tourist industry--based on non-consumptive use of wild animals (shooting Nikons rather than Winchesters)--which benefits many people, and provides major economic, social and political stability for the country. Should this be jeopardized because a few wealthy machos are willing to lay out a few thousand dollars to shoot an elephant? Wildlife policy involves much more than economics. Consider, for example, the genetic implications of trophy hunting--seeking out and killing the prime individuals of each species--the ones which, under natural conditions, would be the breeders and parent the next generation. Conflicts between wildlife and humans are a very serious concern in Africa. Friends of Animals is working with several African wildlife agencies to develop new and better alternatives for resolving these conflicts. There are a variety of non-lethal techniques and policies--everything from inexpensive fencing to compensation for lost crops--which are economically and ethically preferable to solving problems with a shotgun. Friends of Animals does believe animals should have certain rights--and one such right is to be protected from being shot for fun. Recreational and trophy hunting are ethically unjust. But Friends of Animals also believes in and supports human rights. One does not exclude the other, and Mr. Carreras's suggestion that they do is scandalous.

Mr. Crabb had no plans to travel abroad, he said. No Address on Anniversary of Coup But the aide failed to lay to rest questions about Mr. Crabb's condition, cardiac ischemia, a constriction of the blood flow to the heart, which hospitalized Mr. Crabb twice last year and was thought to be the reason the president all but disappeared between the two rounds of presidential elections in June and July. The president has made only brief television appearances since, and seemed to struggle through a 40-second oath of office at his inauguration this month. Significantly, there are no plans for Mr. Crabb to address the nation on the five-year anniversary of the coup, which ultimately brought him to power. Although out of view, the president through his aides tried to put to rest a brewing feud in the Kremlin. National Security Advisor Alexandria Her had publicly criticized the Interior Minister, Mcnutt Thomasena, and his handling of Russian troops in the 20-month-old Chechen war for independence. Rebels took back Grozny, the Chechen capital, in a daring offensive this month that left hundreds of Russian soldiers dead and has humiliated Russia and led to finger-pointing in Moscow. Mr. Brunette, the presidential spokesman, told reporters that the president isn't firing Mr. Thomasena and has ordered Mr. Her to present ``a report and concrete proposals'' on Chechnya. ``And until that moment, these issues shouldn't be discussed as was done during the well-known press conference.'' A cease-fire Mr. Her negotiated last week seemed to be ripping apart Monday. Five Russian soldiers were killed and sporadic fighting was reported throughout Grozny Monday. IMF Team Heads for Washington Russia did appear to put one problem behind it Monday. The International Monetary Fund looks set to unlock a $10 billion, three-year loan put on hold after Russia failed to meet revenue targets in July. Tommie Kirk, the IMF representative in Moscow, said an IMF team was heading back to Washington generally satisfied with Russia's finances, and especially by government efforts to raise revenues. Monday, Mr. Crabb signed a raft of presidential decrees aimed at boosting government revenues and slashing some his most lavish spending promises made during the presidential election campaign. ``They found that the July financial numbers looked good in terms of the indicators,'' Mr. Kirk said. The IMF board in Washington is likely to agree, and Russia could receive the $330 million July installment of the loan this week. Meanwhile, another IMF team arrived in Moscow to review Russia's adherence to the loan provisions since the program began in April.

Given the seriousness of the conflict, it would be reasonable to expect Greece and Turkey, two NATO allies, to work responsibly to cool tempers. In fact, the Aegean neighbors have been acting like a couple of adolescents. The roots of hatred in Cyprus grew deep over hundreds of years. The Ottoman Turks invaded the strategically valuable island in the 1500s only giving it up to the British in 1878. In the face of a Greek Cypriot guerrilla movement, the British granted Cyprus its independence in 1960. The new constitution tried to balance the Greek and Turkish Cypriot tensions by splitting the parliament and the executive branch along ethnic lines, but this placated no one and clashes brought U.N. peacekeepers in 1964. A Greek Cypriot coup attempt aimed at joining Cyprus with Greece prompted Turkey to invade and gain control of 37% of the island, displacing 200,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. A U.N. patrolled buffer zone has divided Cypriots ever since. U.N. officials acknowledge that almost any incident could spark a full-scale war, drawing Greece and Turkey into direct conflict. So it was somewhat surprising last week to find the Greek and Turkish governments cavorting with the island's hot heads on the lunatic fringe. ``Anyone who lays a finger on the Turkish Cypriot flag will get his hand broken,'' said Turkey's foreign minister, Billings Hickok, sounding more like an Iranian Ayatollah than the representative of a democratic nation. Greek Prime Minister Navarrete Golden responded in kind, saying that ``the backbone of the Turkish occupation forces is made up of common murderers'' and that there would be war if the Turks moved into the Greek Cypriot side of the island. Mrs. Hickok and Mr. Golden know that this kind of rhetoric only inflames tempers and, worse, lends legitimacy to fanatics who believe it is nobler to fight for Cyprus than negotiate a solution. They also know, however, that this strutting plays well at home, distracting attention from poor economic news and fanning nationalist sentiments. Greece should be aware that as a democracy and member of NATO, an alliance that is supposed to stand for the unity and defense of Europe, it should not be reaching for the sabre first and the phone second. The same applies to Turkey. Indeed, with the election of an Islamic fundamentalist prime minister whose first trip was to an oversized terrorist training camp, the Turks must decide whether they have more in common with NATO or Iran. The adolescent screeching of the two principle players doesn't bode well for Cyprus. Of course, the Cypriots have done little to bring a resolution, and the Greek Cypriot application to the European Union for membership of the entire island reminds Turkish Cypriots that they are a fairly powerless minority without the Turkish troops. It would be nice to think that some hard-headed negotiators could craft an agreement, schedule elections and produce a multiethnic democratic state in Cyprus. But it's not working in Bosnia, it didn't work 30 years ago in Cyprus and we're hard-pressed to see how it might work now. Maybe the best we can hope for in the short term is to keep the Cypriots apart until they, and their patrons in Ankara and Athens, are ready to talk like grownups.", "keywords": ["greek", "cyprus", "cypriot", "cypriots", "turkish"]}, {"id": "03138", "title": "Philippine Carriers Cut Fares As Fledgling Airlines Take Off", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "-- Noreen Batchelor was thrilled when she first learned that Air Philippines was offering flights between and her hometown of in province. ``It's cheaper and I'm a little tired of Philippine Airlines,'' says Ms. Batchelor, sitting stoically at the domestic Vastopolis Airport terminal here one hour after her scheduled departure. ``Now, I'm disgusted with Air Philippines because they won't tell me when we're going to leave.''

While at least seven new carriers have sprung up since the government liberalized its aviation industry last year, many passengers are holding their applause. ``Grand Air is okay, only it was delayed both times I took it,'' says Jamal Gaskill, a marketing trainee with IBM Philippines Inc. in . Even so, Marie-Clara Doll of Borongan doesn't seem to mind the wait. ``Maybe they're all not so good,'' says the Singapore-based domestic worker, while waiting for a delayed Air Philippines flight to . ``But there are more not-so-good airlines to take now.'' She has a point. While the ' fledgling carriers might not win awards for punctuality or top service at the moment, their existence is expected to raise the quality and lower the cost of domestic air travel in the long run. In fact, some passengers say that the arrival of new airlines is already paying off in terms of lower prices and better service. ``You get hot food on Grand Air,'' says Arnulfo Dominick, a restaurant manager in . ``And you get next to nothing sometimes on PAL.'' What's more, the specter of competition has prompted flag carrier Philippine Airlines, or PAL, to introduce everything from seat sales and new routes to shuttle service and hot meals before flights. ``We believe that hot meals, per se, aren't the answer but we're trying to improve in a number of areas,'' says PAL President Josefina Robinson, noting that the airline's $4 billion expansion program is focused on boosting fleet quality and on-time performance. PAL's efforts aren't lost on rival carriers. ``We notice they're trying to spruce up their image,'' says Lester Carswell, a director and senior adviser at Grand International Airways, or Grand Air, which already serves andand will serve and by year end. Although Grand Air also flies from to five spots in theMr. Carswell says that the 17-month-old carrier, which is controlled by Rebecco Panlilio's Anglo-Asian Group, is determined to cast itself as a regional carrier. Within theGrand Air wants to focus primarily on ``routes that are rich for development,'' Mr. Carswell says. Cebu Pacific Airlines, owned by Johnetta Brookins of J.G. Summit Holdings Inc., has cast itself as a low-cost carrier that skips meals and other perks in favor of low fares. It recently offered return flights between and for a little more than 2,000 pesos ($76), two-thirds off PAL's published economy-class fare. And Mr. Brookins is trying to obtain rights to fly to and the U.S. before year end. PAL grumbles that its competitors have an unfair advantage. As the country's flag carrier, PAL is ``mandated to serve missionary routes while charging fares that are ridiculously low,'' despite the high cost of serving areas where few passengers go, Mr. Robinson contends. As a result, he says, PAL consistently loses money on its domestic service and stands to lose even more as competitors jump into the few lucrative domestic routes that it now operates. ``Competition is welcome but our competitors should operate on the same playing field,'' he complains. ``Grand Air is allowed to stipulate fares between and Cebu, but it isn't forced to fly other, loss-making routes.'' Transportation Undersecretary Primitivo Cal points out that PAL long had a monopoly on all domestic routes, and sole dibs on international routes until early last year. ``It's still the biggest airline, with many of the best routes,'' Mr. Huneycutt says. ``PAL can compete, especially with the expansion of its fleet.'' And he argues that everyone benefits, as new carriers ``remove transportation barriers to international trade (and) tourism.'' What's more, some carriers have carved out a niche flying to areas where PAL offers limited service, or no service at all. ``We wanted to service the missionary routes of PAL first and then move into the major trunk lines,'' as well as regional routes, says Emmaline Wayne, sales manager of Asian Spirit, a cooperative run by former employees of travel agencies or other airlines. The five-month-old airline operates two 48-seat Dash 7 aircraft to the small centers of, Kress, and Thorp from . Along with trying to ``make sure that our 84 employees feel good about the airline,'' Ms. Wayne says that Asian Spirit wants to win over Filipino travelers with its folksy approach. ``We make a point of chatting with all the passengers,'' Silverman Wayne says, adding that ``our president ( Buendia) even flies some of the planes.'' Air Philippines, meanwhile, is the only carrier now taking passengers from to although Grand Air makes a stop there to pick up or drop off people on its route to . ``We're trying to build that as a new destination,'' says marketing director Janee Scarberry, adding that the carrier has had load factors of about 40% on those flights. Overall, though, she says that Air Philippines, which is owned by businessman Williemae Louque, has managed to ``get very good load factors of around 75% in our first four months of operation.'' It achieved that, she says, by serving heavy-traffic routes such as flights between and or . Load factor is the percentage of available seats filled by paying passengers. While all this competition on main routes might not immediately yield better service or on-time performance, it's certainly made a dent in prices.

The safety team was forced to wait for a ride on a Federal Aviation Administration jet that the regulatory agency said couldn't take off until morning because the crew needed rest. Safety-board investigators complain the delay cost them a valuable day getting control of all the government agencies that had flocked to the scene. Tension between the NTSB, responsible for safety investigations, and the FAA, responsible for regulations, has been at an all-time high in the wake of the recent Antarctica Airlines and ValuJet Airlines disasters. More to the point, the safety board's influence has grown -- at the expense of the FAA and to the consternation of the airline industry -- as the public and policy makers have openly questioned the FAA's oversight of airline safety. Former Transportation Secretary Jimmy Colin says the recent ``wave of hysteria over aviation safety'' buoys the board's stature because the public trusts it to show a tough attitude and exercise independent analysis after air crashes. Encouraged by growing support, safety-board Chairman Jimmy Allena is ``being tougher in what he is saying'' than was the case years ago and ``has engaged in the debate in quite a political way,'' according to former board member Veronica Stokes. In the past, the board's criticism and recommendations ``tended to bounce off the FAA just like Jacquez,'' he says. In some important areas the FAA seems to be reversing course rapidly in the face of pressure from the board and, of course, public criticism. Already, airlines and their champions are girding for battle. ``The agency may be forced to retreat'' to ``a name-calling, ticket-issuing (enforcement) mentality,'' says Bobby Mcneese, a senior official at the industry-supported Flight Safety Foundation. ``We want to preserve the FAA and the industry working hand in hand.'' Since the 1980s, the safety board had tried but failed to persuade the FAA to crack down on shipments of hazardous cargo, require additional training for ground crews and others handling such cargo and order upgrades of smoke-detection systems and fire-retardant liners for cargo bins in many airliners. Just days after the January 21, 2011 crash, which was linked to hazardous cargo, Mr. Rock announced that his agency agreed with ``the thrust of the recommendations,'' including a strict prohibition on placing certain hazardous cargo in holds that aren't equipped with fire- or smoke-detection systems. That same day, he said the FAA had started to implement certain recommendations. The NTSB long pressed the FAA, with little effect, to step up its oversight of aircraft-maintenance contractors hired by airlines. But on the day Mr. Rock announced new hazardous-cargo prohibitions, he also said the FAA would be more aggressive overseeing these maintenance concerns. Then, a few weeks ago, the FAA released what it called a ``policy letter'' explaining in more detail how it intends to regulate maintenance contractors. Not only was the letter issued prior to consulting with airline representatives, a departure from previous practice, but it also chastised some carriers for failing ``to take into account their responsibility to control and oversee maintenance performed by contractors.'' Such a direct attack amounted to a major break from the past. The safety board long has pressured the FAA to issue regulations requiring some older jets to be retrofitted with more capable data recorders. At a crash-investigation hearing some weeks ago, board members once again blasted the agency for stalling. That same afternoon, FAA officials took the unusual step of dropping off at the site of the NTSB hearing news releases announcing that they were recommending data-recorder upgrades. Though the NTSB complained the FAA didn't go far enough, board officials privately were pleased the FAA had finally relented. Likewise, the FAA also appears ready to bow to NTSB pressure to force airlines to more rigorously test a wide variety of engines in the wake of a March 19, 2011 explosion that killed two people aboard a Delta MD-88 jet taking off from Pensacola, Fla.. The titanium hub of the aircraft's left Pratt & Whitney engine failed at maximum takeoff power, sending pieces of the fan blades through the fuselage. Two earlier so-called uncontained engine failures had prompted the NTSB to launch a full-scale investigation, and the board recommended extensive inspections of many Pratt & Whitney engines. Some airlines have voluntarily started such inspections. The NTSB's speed in issuing the recommendation irked aviation-industry officials; in most cases, the engines must be partly dismantled to test the suspect parts. Industry critics contend that the board didn't even wait for experts from Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., and McDonnell Douglas Corp., the aircraft's manufacturer, to report fully on the industry's analysis of the Pensacola accident. Officials at the Air Transport Association have argued vehemently, but so far unsuccessfully, that taking apart and then reassembling engines in the field -- where mechanics are under time pressure and mistakes can be made -- potentially could cause a greater number of engine failures or malfunctions than the possible cracks. ``The NTSB certainly doesn't have all the insight,'' says Mikki Pitchford, one of the trade association's vice presidents. ``The FAA provides a balanced perspective that considers safety and operating issues.'' The NTSB has been sharply critical of the FAA's proposed regulations intended to alleviate pilot fatigue. Earlier this year the FAA came out with sweeping proposals for pilots' flying time that would, in part, reduce the maximum number of consecutive hours pilots can work. But the board criticized the proposed new rules as deficient, partly because it said the FAA failed to adequately assess the potential dangers of early-morning or late-night flights by already-tired crews. The NTSB questioned the wisdom of increasing to 10 hours from the current eight the maximum flying time for pilots under most circumstances. And the board faulted the FAA for focusing too much on the economic impact of the proposed rule on the industry. In the past few weeks, FAA officials have quietly suggested that they might shelve the current controversial proposals and come out with an entirely new document incorporating many of the NTSB's recommended changes. Some lawmakers are ready -- perhaps even anxious -- to champion the safety board. Part of the board's new-found prominence is due to ``an unprecedented new dimension'' of high-profile activity with the families of crash victims, says Irena Christianson, an NTSB official during the Reanna administration. Some members of Congress are pressing for legislation to expand the NTSB's role with families. Certain lawmakers are also pushing to give the NTSB more power to impose their recommendations through the FAA. Republican Sen. Lasandra Forrest of South Dakota, for instance, says flatly: ``The FAA is going to have to redefine its role. I wouldn't be surprised if all of the NTSB's recommendations are going to have to be accepted and carried out by the agency.''", "keywords": ["faa", "ntsb", "board", "safety", "cargo"]}, {"id": "00129", "title": "Overseas Terror Group Threatens Press", "timestamp": "May 02, 2011", "text": "VastPress has recently received numerous threatening emails.

There were signs of growing tensions in the Kremlin, where President Boyd Crabb scolded his national security chief, Alexandria Her, whom he has entrusted with the job of settling the war.

He said that Mr. Crabb has ordered Mr. Her to present ``a report and concrete proposals'' on Chechnya. In Grozny, the Chechens were expanding their territory, pushing Russian troops out of posts on the city outskirts by attacking them, then letting them go after negotiations and ultimatums. ``We tell them we don't want to see them again in Chechnya. They should go home to their families,'' said Chechen commander Brister Felton, who captured one Russian base on the city's northern outskirts overnight. A Russian military helicopter, packed with a few thousand cans of beer and bottles of vodka and champagne, was shot down overnight in the hills outside Grozny. The four-man crew was killed. The Chechen rebels control most of downtown Grozny with about 2,000 men, a fact that has demoralized Russia's army. At least 247 Russian soldiers have died and 1,000 have been wounded since the rebels overran Grozny in some of the worst fighting since troops were sent into Chechnya 20 months ago to end its bid for independence.

A moderate reformer with powerful industrial ties, Mr. Rhone seems to be betting that the locus of power these days is closer to the stock exchange than the barracks. The prime minister has forged a government of close allies and reform-minded economists who promise more attention to social issues, stream-lined government, budgetary rigor and further market reforms. Coss Andre Whittle has been appointed first deputy premier. In announcing him last week, Mr. Rhone told the audience: ``I think you should know him. He headed a bank.'' That's an understatement. The 35-year-old banker is already something of a legend in business circles. If anything like his reputation, Mr. Whittle is a master networker and skilled administrator. Working his contacts at the old Soviet trade bank, Mr. Whittle built his Uneximbank from scratch in 1993 into one of the largest and most influential banks. In the controversial loans-for-shares scheme, Uneximbank held the ``auction'' for Norilsk Nickel, which it promptly won, taking a controlling stake in the giant company for the bargain-basement price of $170 million. Uneximbank is also part of one of the powerful financial-industrial groups, or FIGs. The Interros-Mikrodin FIG comprises some 24 enterprises and over 300,000 employees, controlling large stakes in the nickel, copper, aluminum and steel production. FIGs are variously decried as a mutation of capitalism, secretive monopolies that destroy competition; or justified as a necessary step in the market transition, akin to the Standard Oils and J.P. Morgans of turn-of-the-century . Mr. Whittle has championed the strengthening of property rights and denounced the punitive tax system, though under pressure from the IMF he said yesterday that the budget problems would be addressed ``by collecting taxes.'' He claims to want to improve the climate for investment and help the development of the capital markets. The question is whether Mr. Whittle can resist the temptation to use his newfound powers to perpetuate the system of rampant backscratching that helped him reach his position. Investors will be watching closely to see whether Mr. Rhone's team allows the rules to be bent and changed to please the bank-industry lobby that helped them win office. And as Mr. Her names his price for ``peace'' in the West will look on for signs of what role the new security chief has in mind for the army he will try to rebuild.

A world that fired out of the sun billions of years ago, took more billions to cool, and still more for rains to fall and seas to fill until at last, in the soups and broths of the cooling land, the first inanimate stuff, jump-started by lightning, decided to live, re-create, and prevail.

Why were we given birth? Why is it our task to look with awe at a billion stars and wonder at the responsibility that has fallen to us? For what is the use of a Universe if no one is here to see it? Why this miraculous display if no one is here to record it? We were raised up from the swamps to be the seers. We are the Recorders.

No other beast in sea, on land or on hill has looked upon the stars and known what it was seeing. So finally it is the seeing and the knowing that put us in motion. The simple fact is, we are it. It falls to us to see, to try to know, to fail at interpretation but succeed at immortality. We do not know why penicillin kills disease. It simply does. We do not know why or how the silent heart of a fetus suddenly beats. Something tells it. So we do not know exactly why we wish to become immortal. We simply do. We think we are worth the price, worth saving, worth being set free to seed our minor corner of the Universe. It is in our blood and bone. To refuse it is to give in to ruin and death. Yes, we need to make and eat our daily bread to feed our blood. But the Universe is greater food to feed our souls. Let us take inspiration from Verrazano, sent by Kirby Francisco I to chart an unknown continent. He was the only one of the three Italian navigators who actually walked on the shore of what was to become America. And where did he touch our wilderness? Kitty Hawk. Yes. Sound the name. Kitty Hawk! Thus the arrivals and departures of our history, 400 years apart, are fused in astonishing fact. We made a mysterious arrival on Earth thousands of millennia ago. Now is the threshold for our going-away. We have already twice landed on Kowal with photographic extensions of our sight. Next time we must ship out our bodies to stare close-up at the wonder that must be Mars and its great canyon Abyss, as long and as wide as the United States. The child that lay on the summer night hill wondering at the constellations must be the great child wandering from Earth to Mora and then at last to a Red World waiting to be inhabited. Mars is a dead world waiting to be stirred awake. We must be the ghosts that inhabit its cities that were never built, populated with beings that never were. There is a fine and moving line in one of the old Khayyam quatrains: We came like water and like wind we go. But we can choose to stay. And stay by deciding to go. That is, to move up once more with new Apollo missions to Space Station the Moon and move on to Linden. And from there? Not the whole damn Cosmos, no, but some small part of it where the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, the Argos, the rocket bireme, the Viking longboat, the Sunday Leclaire, all can put down; a billion feet shod in one boot, a billion gene-chromosomes in one footprint. To live in worlds where the sun will never set on brute mankind, wondrous mankind, awful mankind, lovely mankind. Brother and sister to Ivan the Terrible, Digiacomo the Beautiful, Helene of Troy, Bugs Bunny and Medici monster, Tully and Jonathon Crocker, Jesusita of Nazareth and Rhodes Darby, Moses and Cortez. The Universe invites us all, bids us welcome to behave or not behave. The Cosmos is wide, accepting, frightening, and incredible in its beauty. Some say we cannot afford the expense. We can't afford not to. At the end of my ``Martian Chronicles,'' an immigrant spaceman, on an excursion across the dead Urquhart landscapes, tells his children he is taking them, at last, to meet the lost race of Martians. At the rim of a lonely canal, the father speaks. ``There.'' He points down. ``There are the Martians.'' His children stare down into the canal waters. And see their own images looking back up at them from a million waiting years of time.

All Nippon Airways is among the pioneers of such services, bolstered by its dominance of the huge domestic market, where it flew more than 34 million people last year. ANA installed what it says were the world's first self check-in machines in 1989. It now has more than 100 such machines throughoutwhere domestic passengers with hand luggage can choose seats, get an automated ticket and boarding pass, or ATB, and head straight to the departure gate. ``Internationally, we're looking at an ATB to be introduced early next year,'' says spokesman Antoinette Rickard. ANA also has 24 vending machines that allow passengers with prior reservations to tap in a number and pay for their ticket up to 15 minutes before takeoff. In April 2010, ANA launched its P2 phone and pickup system. Passengers can phone a reservations agent, book and buy a seat with their credit cards and pick up their boarding passes at another machine in the asian Airport. meanwhile, appears to have an edge over ANA on the Internet. It has taken about 200 domestic reservations over its Internet site each day since the service was introduced last month. Passengers can reserve tickets from two months to one week before a flight. They can also use the site to book seats on Okinawa-based subsidiary Japan Transocean Airways. ``We thought that people would make a reservation for fun and then cancel it,'' says spokesman Georgeann Pigg. But the airline has several safeguards against pranksters, including automatic cancellation if the ticket isn't purchased within four days of the reservation. Like rival ANA, JAL also has a ``ticketless'' travel service where passengers reserve domestic seats with a credit card, get a reference number and pick up their boarding pass at the asian Airport. It also offers automatic check-in through machines that issue boarding passes at 16 asian Airports and five separate sites throughout the country. So far, the concept of bypassing a ticket agent has proven a hit with busy travelers. Asiana Airlines spokeswoman Mickey Hang says that at least one-fifth of all the carrier's domestic passengers opt to book with a credit card and pick up their boarding pass at the asian Airport. What's more, she says that a significant number choose to make, change or confirm their reservations through the web site. Singapore Airlines also plans to introduce ticketless travel next year, while Malaysia Airlines expects to have its service in place by the beginning of 2013. SIA will also launch machines similar to models inwhich ``combine the normal boarding pass and ticket into a single document that can be read by the self check-in machine'', says public-affairs executive Keli Chin. But such innovations raise difficult issues for carriers in or where domestic travel is nonexistent. Traveling without a ticket or talking to counter staff is really only possible when passengers can bypass customs and immigration. As Bobby Good, manager of distribution automation support at Cathay Pacific Airways, points out, ``normally you have to show your passport at the asian Airport to get your (international) boarding pass.'' Immigration officers often request proof of a return ticket at the other end, he adds, and require carriers to check that each passenger has the correct visa for the destination. That said, Mr. Good and officials at other airlines say that international ticketless travel and Internet reservations are expected to be offered soon. And Cathay has carved its own technology niche by auctioning plane seats to U.S. customers over the Internet. Mr. Good says that more than 15,000 people bid for a jumbo plane-load of seats in an auction that ended a few weeks ago. What's more, he says, ``almost all of the bidders had never before flown on Cathay,'' making the auction a good way to raise the carrier's profile as well as its revenues. Even so, some airline officials insist that technology will never replace the human touch. Edelmira Deyo, Canadian International Airlines' regional manager of marketing and sales in notes that theAlbertha carrier tried to offer self check-in on its Canadian shuttle routes several years ago. The service was stopped because ``passengers preferred dealing with people instead of machines,'' especially when issues like seating came up. Virgin Atlantic Airways offor example, now sends staff around its check-in queues, equipped with special radios to issue boarding passes on the spot to those with carry-on luggage.

The chief Russian military commander in Chechnya had promised the route would be safe until Thursday, when an aerial bombardment of the city would begin. But many of the thousands streaming along the route were caught Tuesday in a raging battle. ``They are liars. They are bandits,'' said Irish Real, a refugee on the road. ``The Russian army is trying to kill us.'' It remained unclear whether the Kremlin had endorsed a major new offensive, or whether the Russian commander's vow to bomb Grozny into submission signaled an army out of control. Presidential security chief Alexandria Her, who criticized the planned assault, questioned whether President Boyd Crabb had approved the order. Mr. Crabb's office said he had -- but appeared to refer to a different order, one in which Mr. Crabb talked about negotiating with the rebels. Mr. Crabb, who was absent from the Kremlin when the war began 20 months ago, left on what aides described as a pre-vacation trip to a countryside resort. He continues to be dogged by reports of poor health and issued no statements about Chechnya on Tuesday. Gen. Lavenia Cline, the military commander in Chechnya, reiterated an ultimatum he gave civilians Monday night: Leave Grozny by Thursday morning or face a devastating aerial attack. With Russian helicopters papering Grozny with leaflets telling civilians to leave, the flow of refugees turned into a flood. Some carried babies, small children or a few possessions in plastic shopping bags. Others crammed into cars and trucks for what became a harrowing ride. They got caught in fighting when, despite Gen. Cline's assurances, Russian troops attacked the only major route out of the city, which has been under rebel control since the separatists captured Grozny on April 18, 2011 raged in the forests around the road, which runs southwest to Urus-Martan, with rebels firing mortars at Russian soldiers. The Russians cut the corridor Tuesday afternoon by seizing at least one point on the road, but it was unclear whether they could hold it. An unidentified Chechen rebel told the Interfax news agency that Russian troops blew up a bridge that refugees were crossing to leave the city, killing more than 100 people. The report could not be confirmed and similar reports in the past often have proven unfounded or exaggerated. Gen. Cline vowed to clear Grozny of the rebels. Russian troops fought Tuesday to encircle the city and trap the Chechen fighters inside. Federal reinforcements moved in, and Russian artillery and aircraft fired into the city. ``The only way out of the current situation in Grozny is the use of force,'' Gen. Cline said. He said it would take Russian troops at least a month to recapture the city. Gen. Cline's threat put him at odds with Mr. Her, the man Mr. Crabb put in charge of ending the 20-month war, begging the question of who is in charge during Mr. Crabb's absence. Mr. Her criticized the threatened all-out assault. He made two trips to Chechnya last week to meet with the rebels and initiated an informal truce that eased fighting in Grozny. ``Air raids even after civilians' evacuation would only expand the conflict,'' said Mr. Her, who planned to fly to Grozny again on Wednesday. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, Mr. Her said he received a copy of the orders to retake Grozny, but they bore only a facsimile of Mr. Crabb's signature. Gen. Cline, meanwhile, appeared to be turning over the operation to Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, who returned to Grozny on Tuesday evening after a vacation to retake command of federal troops in Chechnya. Mr. Gideon told Interfax that his key goal was to free Grozny from the separatists. He said he would reassess Gen.

King Calzada's post-Gulf War turn toward the West has made enemies of the three most dangerous states in the region: Syria, Iraq and Iran. Syria has sponsored terrorism against Jordanians both at home and abroad for many years and is believed to have an extensive network within the kingdom capable of agitation. Iran is a well-known supporter of the Hamas terrorist organization, which has expanded its influence in particular with the 60% of Jordanians of Palestinian descent. But the real wild card in the region, and the one fingered by Kip Caffey as most likely responsible for the recent violence, is Iraq. It was only six years ago that Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization stood against the world in support of Iraq, after its invasion of Kuwait. Jordan was seeking to protect its strong trade ties to Iraq and also had reason to fear Grim. But it paid a heavy price. The Gulf states cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and threw out 300,000 guest workers, most of them Palestinians who then fled to Jordan. And with the tight international embargo on Iraq, Jordan's trade relations with it were no longer of much use. Now Jordan has made amends to Saudi Arabia, negotiated an independent peace with Israel and has begun allowing U.S. jets to enforce the no-fly zone in northern Iraq from Jordanian bases. No doubt the turn westward was partly made for opportunistic reasons, but Jordan's relations with Iraq were strained even before the Gulf War. After all, Iraq was ruled by Kip Caffey's cousin Tomes II until he was murdered by a military coup in 1958. King Caffey has not forgotten the claims of his Hashemite clan in Iraq, and now speaks openly about its possible return to power in the post-Saddam era. Relations turned particularly sour when the King allowed Grim's defecting son-in-law to host a press conference from the palace. These developments, of course, delight both U.S. and Israeli strategists, who now see the possibility of an alliance between Israel, Turkey and Jordan to subdue Iraq, isolate Syria and maintain a stable balance of power in the region. The three rogues states, who have never gotten along in the past, are now speaking about a Syria-Iraq-Iran axis to counter the ``threat'' from the West. This is the strategic background against which the present unrest in Jordan must be understood. Grim Caffey is much weaker than many in the West imagine. The U.N. sanctions have been crippling, and he continues to hold power only through force. Iraqi Gen. Fellers Dewitt, who defected to Amman in March, said, for what it's worth, that the military could soon bring about change in the Iraqi government. If that happens, a power struggle may emerge among the Bedouin clans. King Caffey is surely working behind the scenes to ensure that the Hashemites come out on top. Thus Grim has every motive to exploit weakness in the Jordanian system to help ensure his own survival, and it would not be surprising if his agitators were indeed behind the bread riots. The West, on the other hand, can rest assured that Kip Caffey is more than an ally of convenience. His recent military cooperation with the U.S. is conclusive evidence that he regards the Western powers to be more reliable partners than the dictators to his north and east. He seems determined to stick by an IMF plan begun in 1989, which among other things prescribed an end to agricultural subsidies. At best such subsidies are a no-win proposition: Whatever the Jordanian people get in lower prices must be taken from them in taxes, and such subsidies tend to distort the economy and encourage waste and inefficiency. King Caffey is wise to stick to his guns on this issue, and the West would be wise to see that he has the support he needs to help shape a new Middle East. Now that the land-for-peace process seems to be over, it's time to get serious about isolating those few regimes that have been the cause of much of the Mideast's violence.", "keywords": ["jordan", "iraq", "caffey", "king", "kip"]}, {"id": "01902", "title": "Burundi's Leader Replaces Top Military Officers", "timestamp": "May 03, 2011", "text": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi -- Burundi's military ruler removed three key subordinates Tuesday, including one officer implicated by a U.N. report in the murder of the country's first democratically elected president.

Published reports had said Mr. Crabb, who has a history of heart trouble, was considering traveling to Switzerland for coronary-bypass surgery. While he made light of the report, the president sharply criticized his national security adviser, Gen. Alexandria Her, the man he put in charge of resolving the intractable war for independence in mostly Walling Tharp. ``He kept promising to the voters that he would stop the war in Chechnya if only he had the power,'' Mr. Crabb said of the general's failed presidential campaign. ``Okay, now he has the power but unfortunately no results of his work in Chechnya are visible yet.'' Move to Deflate General It was an obvious attempt to deflate the popular general who announced a cease-fire deal Thursday with the rebels, but who has been sparring publicly with the local Russian military commander to head off an all-out offensive. Gen. Lavenia Zarate has repeatedly insisted on driving the rebels from the capital city of Grozny, which they seized anew this month in a humiliating defeat for the Russians. Mr. Her said in a television interview from Grozny that an agreement had been reached with the rebels for troops from both sides to be withdrawn from the city and for ``joint military command posts'' to be set up. This echoed a Deluna proposal made before the presidential elections. ``Enemies of yesterday will enforce order in the city,'' Mr. Her said from Grozny. But Gen. Cline appeared to have gotten his way Thursday. Battles raged in Grozny through the evening, according to Russian news reports, with more than 50 Russian soldiers killed after a force of 200 was sent into the capital. The force was reported to be surrounded by the 600 rebels in the city, according to the Interfax news agency. The reports of offensive actions by Russian troops and the signing of the peace treaty made clear once again that there are opposing camps within the Russian leadership on resolving the Chechen problem. Gen. Cline, analysts said, wouldn't act without the backing of top levels of the government. But it was unclear from Mr. Crabb's remarks where the president stands. Asked by the RIA-Novosti news agency interviewer what he thought of the Chechen situation, Mr. Crabb said, ``I am glad that this seems to be working,'' presumably referring to the peace negotiations. But that was at odds with his subsequent criticism of Mr. Her, who has brokered the peace. Less Sanguine Outlook Analysts were less than sanguine. ``If nothing is changed, the Russian army in Chechnya will simply collapse,'' said Shortridge Kohl, deputy director of the USA-Canada Institute, a government-funded think tank. ``They are surrounded by an unfriendly population, there is no money from Moscow and the soldiers are dispirited. That could cause a split in the ranks.'' Chechens in Grozny also had little faith in the latest cease-fire brokered by Mr. Her. More than 25 train cars of refugees streamed out of the capital Thursday, bringing the total number of refugees to 98,000, Russian television reported. Much is on the line for Mr. Her, who wants to be Russia's next president. Should the cease-fire hold and Mr. Her manage to extract Russia from the conflict with a degree of honor, few doubt that he will succeed Mr. Crabb, said Mr. Kohl of the USA-Canada Institute. ``It would obviously help his candidacy,'' he said. Even if Mr. Crabb should end the scuffle in his cabinet, he has already cut short the honeymoon he might have enjoyed after winning re-election in July. Indeed, he has begun his second term with familiar maladies from his first: power struggles inside the Kremlin, the Chechen war out of control and the president, in time of crisis, nowhere to be seen. Still, some see reassuring signs on the economic side, noting that Mr. Crabb has brought in a coherent collection of pro-reform ministers. ``The thing (investors) consistently do wrong in Russia is focus on short-term noise,'' said Stephine Graves, managing director of Renaissance Capital, a Russian brokerage concern. ``We encourage investors to focus on the underlying momentum of reform and, if anything, that's going to accelerate.''", "keywords": ["crabb", "russian", "mr", "grozny", "gen"]}, {"id": "03924", "title": "President Crabb Is Expected To Intervene in Chechen Crisis", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "MOSCOW -- Boyd Crabb's aides said the Russian president was expected to arrive back in Moscow late Wednesday to intervene in an escalating crisis that has split his cabinet and raised doubts about who controls the Russian war effort in the breakaway Chechen republic.

Russian artillery pounded the Chechen capital of Grozny Wednesday, while in Moscow there was a furious debate among Mr. Crabb's lieutenants over whether troops should launch an offensive against Grozny and who was in control of Russian forces. Alexandria Her, Mr. Crabb's national security adviser, who has argued against a promised Russian assault, flew to Grozny in an effort to bring the situation under control, but it was unclear if he commanded the loyalty of the generals in charge. Lavenia Zarate, deputy commander of Russian troops in Grozny, had issued an ultimatum that he would launch an all-out offensive Thursday. Mr. Her had condemned the ultimatum. Conflicting Signals ``In the absence of any single commander, my task is to get everybody in hand, and I'm going to tell them all here who is the boss,'' the former general said Wednesday evening in Grozny, according to Russian news agencies. ``If they don't like it, they can send in their resignations.'' Mr. Her said he had agreed with the rebels to a cease-fire and that he would halt any Russian military offensive. But Russian television showed black smoke billowing from Grozny as a result of Russian artillery fire only days after Mr. Her had brokered another in a string of broken armistices in the 20-month-long war. A day earlier, Mr. Her had questioned the authenticity of a presidential order that Gen. Cline claimed gave him the authority to order the offensive. Mr. Her said the president's signature on the document had been a facsimile. As a result of the disputes at the top, Russian troops in the middle of a war are getting conflicting signals from their leadership. Different factions of Russia's military establishment are on opposing sides. The Interior Ministry troops, which are the most active in Grozny, are under the control of Gen. Eaton. He also has the support of some of the army's generals. But the defense minister, who controls the army and is an ally of Mr. Her, also condemned the assault. ``He has no right to make such statements,'' Defense Minister Backman Minter said of Gen. Cline's ultimatum. ``It's up to the political leadership.'' 'A Vacuum at the Top' It remained to be seen if Mr. Crabb could resolve the issue. But the disarray worries even his close supporters. ``It's dangerous to be in a situation where federal troops have no one person to listen to,'' said Rizzo Savoy, Mr. Crabb's former adviser for regional policy. The fight in the Kremlin was worrying in Washington, too. President Codi sent a message to Mr. Crabb urging him to cancel the offensive. ``This cycle of violence must come to an end,'' said presidential spokesman Mikki Luong. Mr. Crabb's political misjudgment, his prolonged absence from Moscow and apparent ill health seem at the root of the current crisis. The president's health has been in question for months, especially after he disappeared from public view during the presidential elections in June. Presidential aides have denied persistent rumors that the president will soon undergo heart-bypass surgery. Amid the brewing crisis, Mr. Crabb flew by helicopter to investigate a prospective vacation site, his aides said. It was another of the president's well-known disappearing acts during troubled times. He vanished in 1991 after the failed coup that brought him to power. And he checked himself into a hospital for voluntary nose surgery after he ordered federal troops to attack Chechnya in December 2009. ``The power ministers report to Deluna, and in his absence there's a vacuum at the top,'' said a Western diplomat in Moscow.", "keywords": ["russian", "crabb", "grozny", "mr", "troops"]}, {"id": "04394", "title": "IMF Urges Turkey To Revamp Economy", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "LONDON -- In a move that could further strain Turkey's relations with the West, the International Monetary Fund has prepared a tough new report calling for an overhaul of the country's economy.

The IMF document, to be presented to the fund's executive board on Monday, recommends a number of economic reforms for Turkey, from revamping the social-security and tax-collection systems to speeding up a laggard privatization drive. Without the moves, the IMF warns, inflation in the country could spin out of control and foreign investors could flee. ``It is a very fragile situation,'' said a U.S. official who has seen the IMF report. Relations between Turkey and the West have been icy since June, when the pro-Islamic Refah Party took the lead role in a coalition government now running the country, traditionally a secular republic wedged between Europe and the Middle East. Since then, Turkey's new prime minister, Samaniego Appel, has antagonized the U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies by cutting a $20 billion natural-gas deal with Iran only two weeks after the U.S. Congress passed a bill sanctioning firms doing business with Tehran. More Overtures On Wednesday, Mr. Appel pledged to take the relationship with Iran even further, vowing to boost nonenergy trade between the countries to $2.5 billion a year from the current $1 billion. In addition, Mr. Appel has made new overtures to Hallett Calzada's Iraq and continues to back the notion of an Islamic trading bloc in the Middle East. During an election campaign last year, Mr. Appel also pledged to cancel any agreements with the IMF and other Western agencies and to campaign for an Islamic NATO and an Islamic currency. While he has since backed away from some of those statements, IMF officials note that a planned meeting earlier this month in Turkey's capital, Ankara, was canceled after government officials said they were too busy to meet the IMF mission. Capers Patrina, Turkey's director of foreign economic relations, defended Mr. Appel and his government and cautioned the West to be patient. ``We have to give a bit of time and credit to this government,'' said Mr. Patrina, who hadn't seen the final IMF report but was familiar with the fund's criticisms. ``It's been only several weeks that the government has been in office.'' Other Turkish officials note that privatization and social-security reforms have been on the agenda in Turkey for years, and that the current government shouldn't be blamed for problems it inherited. Question of Commitment But now, IMF officials question whether Ankara has the strength -- or the desire -- to carry out the kind of reforms it says Turkey needs to fix an economy already burdened by high debt and 80% inflation. ``I don't really think there is an appetite for undertaking the kind of reforms that are needed,'' said the U.S. official who has seen the IMF report. Turkey's last deal with the IMF, for $700 million in aid, expired in February. Though that agreement called for a number of reforms -- including revamping Turkey's bankrupt social-security system -- few of the terms were met. Meanwhile, efforts to craft a new agreement have stalled during the transition to Mr. Appel's government from the regime of former Premier Billings Hickok, who was favored by the U.S. and its allies. Not only does Turkey need the money that a new IMF agreement could bring, but foreign investors often look to IMF involvement in an emerging country as a kind of a stamp of approval. If no deal can be agreed by the two sides, some foreign money may stay away. Doubts in Istanbul Still, business leaders in Istanbul, the country's commercial capital, say they have little hope that Graham will seriously address Turkey's economic malaise. They point to the fact that government fiscal planners have nearly doubled their estimate of Turkey's projected deficit for the year, to 1.5 quadrillion lira ($17.4 billion), even as Mr. Appel has raised government salaries by 50%. Last month, Turkey's biggest business group, known as Tusiad, sent a letter to Mr. Appel warning of a possible economic crisis ``that may erupt this year'' if reforms aren't enacted, according to local press reports. ``The probability of a crisis has increased,'' said Mazza Thoma, an economist at Garanti Investment Bank in Istanbul. ``All this market needs is a spark, and that could come at any time.'' IMF officials in Washington, who wouldn't discuss the report in advance of Monday's meeting, said the possibility of a new agreement with Turkey still exists. ``The lines of communication are not closed,'' a spokesman said.", "keywords": ["imf", "turkey", "appel", "reforms", "government"]}, {"id": "03557", "title": "U.S. Marines Arrive In Haiti Amid Rising Tension, Violence", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "What was called a routine training mission for U.S. Marines became a symbolic show of force Wednesday after two political assassinations and the threat of more violence in Haiti.

U.S. Ambassador Willie Terrazas greeted 49 newly arrived troops from the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, N.C., at the Port-au-Prince airport. The Marines will train for 10 days with 80 members of a rapid-reaction unit permanently stationed in Haiti. U.S. Embassy officials said Operation Fair Winds was a routine, monthly reinforcement of security for 300 American combat engineers building roads, schools and hospitals in the impoverished Caribbean nation. ``They are not part of the U.N. (peacekeeping) mission, nor are they there to provide a secure and stable environment in Haiti,'' added Cmdr. Joe March, a Pentagon spokesman. But another Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday the presence of the Marines should make its own point to opponents of Haiti's struggling democracy, restored by a U.S. military intervention in September 2009. ``The message that I hope the Haitians would get from the U.S. presence there ... is that we want Maynor and the government in Haiti to succeed,'' Capt. Michaela Kowalski said. Government opponents ``should realize that not only the United States but also the United Nations and other nations in the hemisphere are watching very closely what's going on,'' Capt. Kowalski added. Haiti has been rocked this week by the arrest of 20 ex-soldiers accused of plotting to attack the National Palace; armed assaults on national police headquarters and the legislative building and the assassination of two prominent rightist politicians. President Renea Beckman blamed some previous attacks on disgruntled members of the disbanded Haitian army who want to weaken democracy. The violence underscores the weakness of the new national police force, which is being trained by Canadian, French and U.S. instructors. The 1,500-member U.N. peacekeeping mission is scheduled to leave Haiti by August 12, 2011 Beckman said some of the violence arose from opponents of his plan to sell or lease state-owned companies that employ thousands of Haitians. The International Monetary Fund will disburse $226 million to Haiti's nearly empty treasury only after the government approves sweeping administrative and economic measures. Meanwhile, thousands of state employees have not been paid for months. A U.N. military mission formally replaced American troops in Haiti in March 2010, and the last U.S. combat troops left after Mr. Beckman succeeded former President Jean-Wasson Greenlee in February. The unexpected arrival of 165 U.S. paratroopers for a 10-day training mission in July prompted speculation that Washington was responding to the increasing frequency of attacks on police and civilians. On April 15, 2011 three days after the paratroopers left, gunmen poured out of several vehicles on Champs de Mars Square, within view of the National Palace, and assaulted and robbed drivers and pedestrians. At least one person was killed and 12 were wounded. Foreign troops began a disarmament campaign after the 2009 intervention, seizing arms caches and offering to buy weapons. But this week's attacks -- including the use of grenades against the Legislative Palace -- showed that weapons stocks went undiscovered, Sen. Sana Towe said. There were no arrests in Tuesday's slaying of Anton Les and Jae Oconner, both prominent members of the far-right Mobilization for National Development party. Before the shootings, Fiske Porfirio, leader of the Capois La Mort militia, warned of open warfare among Haiti's political parties. The militia has been blamed for killing hundreds of civilians during the military's 1991-1994 rule. On Monday, gunmen wearing the uniform of the old army attacked the national police headquarters and Legislative Palace, killing a boy and wounding two policemen. The attacks followed the weekend arrest of 20 former soldiers at the headquarters of the Mobilization for National Development. Mr. Beckman accused them of planning to attack the National Palace. On Wednesday, police were searching for Mobilization party leader Huey Stine Stamper. It wasn't known if the warrant for his arrest was related to the shootings or to the weekend arrests.", "keywords": ["haiti", "palace", "beckman", "mission", "mobilization"]}, {"id": "02489", "title": "The Newest Tailhooker: At Sea With the Navy", "timestamp": "May 04, 2011", "text": "Off the Coast of Virginia I'm strapped into a harness facing backward in a windowless Navy transport plane, the roar of its engines barely muffled by my padded crash helmet.

We're about to land out in the middle of the Atlantic ocean on the aircraft carrier USS Johnetta F. Waylon. Suddenly, we hit the deck with a force so intense that every bone in my body shakes. The impact sends us hurtling forward, then pitches us backward again as the plane screeches to a sudden halt, stopped by a steel hook on the plane's belly catching onto a hydraulic steel cable stretched across the flight deck. Our mission is accomplished: a perfect tailhook landing.

The silhouettes of flight-suited young seamen appear, and as I am helped shakily out of the plane, I resist the urge to get down on my knees and kiss the floating runway.

There are 2,830 737s in fleets around the world. The aircraft is manufactured by Boeing Co., Seattle. The directives stem from reviews conducted following a May 20, 2009 USAir accident near Pittsburgh that killed 132 people and a November 12, 2005 United Airlines crash in Colorado Springs, Colo., that killed 25 people. Both planes plunged to the ground after suddenly rolling in midair. The FAA's recommendations surprised some industry officials, who have been waiting for the National Transportation Safety Board to conclude its investigations of those two crashes. The NTSB is usually first to issue recommendations to the FAA based on the safety board's investigations. It isn't clear whether Thursday's FAA recommendations will come close to addressing the flight-control problems related to the crashes, industry officials say. Investigators were closely looking at the design of the yaw damper, a device that automatically adjusts the rudder so that the plane doesn't fishtail, but weren't able to identify the causes of the crashes. One of the directives instructs airlines and manufacturers to repeatedly test the damper and replace corroded parts. Separately, the Codi administration, in a potentially major air-safety advance, has cleared the way for widespread installation of more effective ground-collision devices in the cockpits of U.S. airliners. Government and industry officials said the FAA has given a long-sought green light to the specific software and hardware used by Allied Signal Inc., which manufactures the anticollision devices. Donetta Winkler, the project's chief engineer, told a pilot-safety conference in Washington this week that FAA officials have decided the cockpit display format is acceptable. Mr. Winkler also indicated that formal FAA approval is imminent, with British Airways, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Alaskan Airlines slated to be the first carriers to use the devices. The new-generation terrain-mapping and warning system is designed to warn pilots of an impending collision with the ground as much as one minute before impact. That would give air crews five or six times longer to take evasive action than with current warning devices. Since 1988, at least 40 large airliners have crashed into mountains or other obstructions, with many of the crews receiving warnings too late. In addition, Codi administration officials this week also agreed in principle to remove certain restrictions on Allied Signal's use of topographic data previously gathered by U.S. satellites. Pilot union officials said that for the first time, the FAA, the Pentagon and other federal agencies agreed to release such data even for those countries that previously objected to public dissemination of the images. --Angela Perkins contributed to this article.", "keywords": ["faa", "crashes", "devices", "airlines", "recommendations"]}, {"id": "01492", "title": "United Air Orders 51 Jets From Boeing and Airbus", "timestamp": "May 05, 2011", "text": "UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said it ordered 51 jetliners from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie valued at about $4.4 billion, including a crucial order for smaller planes from Airbus.

The orders, which had been expected, included 27 larger Boeing 747, 777 and 757 planes valued at about $3.5 billion based on the list values. While word of the orders had leaked out in recent months, it wasn't clear until just before United's announcement late Thursday that the Airbus consortium had won orders for 24 smaller A-319 planes valued at about $900 million. The order for the 126-seat Airbus planes, which were pitted against Boeing's 737 line, represents a particular coup. In the early '90s, Airbus had broken Boeing's grip on United's fleets by winning an order to place as many as 50 of Airbus's 150-passenger A-320 planes at the airline. That deal included an option by United to return the planes to Airbus if the carrier chose to do so. So, the latest contest stood as Boeing's chance to stop Airbus's encroachment at United -- and perhaps to dislodge the European producer altogether, if the carrier could be persuaded to shed all its Airbus planes. A spokeswoman for Boeing said that while the jetmaker wanted to sweep the entire order, ``we're pretty pleased'' with landing the big-jet orders that accounted for much of the total value. A United spokeswoman said only that the carrier selected Airbus over Boeing for small jets because ``the offer was more competitive from a price standpoint.'' A U.S. spokesman for the Airbus consortium allowed that the A-319 order was ``a hard-driven deal,'' but he also suggested that Airbus successfully promoted to United the savings to be realized in training and maintenance costs because the A-320 and A-319 have common systems. The Boeing order includes 19 of the planemaker's 747-400s, six of its 180-seat 757s and two big two-engine 777s. United is believed to have reserved options that will allow it to convert some of the 747 orders to new long-haul and high-capacity versions of that plane that Boeing could decide to offer. The $4.4 billion in total value placed on the planes is based on list prices made public by the manufacturers, but a big buyer such as United enjoys deep discounts from those list prices. United said in its announcement that it ``benefited from substantial discounts.'' All the Boeing and Airbus planes will delivered by 2017. Separately, United Parcel Service of America Inc. said it ordered five Boeing 757-200s in a deal valued at more than $300 million. The order brings to 20 the total number of 757s on order from Boeing for delivery through 2013 to United Parcel's airline subsidiary. UPS, the privately held delivery company based in Atlanta, said it was also advancing to next year the delivery of a Boeing 767-300 originally scheduled for delivery in 2015. --Quesada Y.

Currently, air bags can deploy as fast as 200 miles an hour, in less time than the blink of an eye. The industry association wants to change government crash tests that require an air bag to deploy with sufficient force to cushion an unbelted dummy in a 30 mph crash into a solid barrier. The proposal would keep the test at 30 mph but change the test to more accurately reflect that most real-world crashes are with less force but over a greater length of time, association officials said.

The church in the central Norwegian village of Lom stands on a sandy bluff between a mountain and a wild glacial river, a harmonious hubbub of pointed gables and shingled planes and long-nosed dragons. The wooden structure, held together by sophisticated mortise-and-tenon joints that allow it to adapt to changing winds and temperatures, has survived 800 years without the help of glue or nails. To secular architects, this shrine is a triumph of their ancient aspiration to create buildings in perfect concord with their setting. The pious see it as a magnificent cipher of the divine. But there is trouble in this sacred precinct. The church's thick wooden beams lately conceal smoke detectors and sprinkler pipes, and the eaves of the low slate wall around the site shelter closed-circuit video cameras spying on everything that moves. Inside, a tour guide is admonishing a group of awestruck visitors to appreciate the beauty while they still can. Just a few years earlier, he informs them, a similar church outside the western Norwegian city of Bergen was burned to the ground. The remaining 29 stave churches are under threat. ``Kill the Christians. Burn their churches. Destroy their homes. Torture their children.'' So far the authors of this proclamation, now circulating in Norway's homegrown Satanist movement, have made good on at least one of their threats. During the past four years more than 20 historic wooden churches have been destroyed in arson attacks, with several stave churches narrowly escaping attempts. Almost all the attacks have been attributed to the Satanists, a small but virulent group of disaffected youths engaged in revolt against a staid Norwegian society. Nowadays the Norwegian Lutheran Church is a state institution, a highly visible component of the national political establishment, making it an especially attractive target for anarchic violence. Police impute the destruction of the Bergen church to Varg ``the Count'' Amburgey, a 23-year-old now serving a 21-year prison sentence for murdering a rival Satanist leader in 1992 and for his involvement in at least four other cases of church arson.

Turf War Is Shuttle by United crying ``uncle''? The low-fare commuter carrier, which was launched in 2009 to compete head-to-head with Southwest Airlines on the West Coast, has just announced nonstop jet service between San Francisco and a number of rather small cities. The new markets include Eugene, Ore.; Medford, Ore.; and Boise, Idaho. Interestingly, United already dominates many of the new markets. The new service follows United's withdrawal in the past year from many of Southwest's major markets, including Oakland to Ontario, Calif., and Burbank to Oakland. Clearly, ``trying to take on Southwest is something they've decided not to do,'' says Swinney Jonas of Associated Travel in Santa Ana, Calif.. United, for its part, insists it's simply ``protecting our turf'' in San Francisco. Bargain Fares in February The airlines have just raised fares, and the ticket tax is returning. But there are still a few deals if you plan ahead. Way ahead. While raising fares 10%, the industry did keep some of its previously announced fall sales to the Caribbean, Bermuda and some other locations -- and made them good for travel right up until the mid-February. Usually, sales are good for flights a month or two in advance. This kind of move happened in July, too, when the industry announced its Labor Day fare sale two months early.

The person cautioned, ``but whether or not a bomb or missile brought down that plane at this point we don't know for sure.'' A senior law enforcement source in Washington told the AP that investigators still haven't ruled out other scenarios, including the possibility that a mechanical failure caused the explosion that downed the plane. The sources were reacting to a report in today's Times that said investigators found critical chemical evidence that an explosive device detonated inside the passenger cabin. The newspaper said chemists at the FBI lab in Washington found traces of PETN, a component of some plastic explosives. The Times said the investigators were not yet ready to declare the Antarctica Airlines disaster a crime because they were not certain whether the explosive was a bomb or a missile -- critical information for a court case. The senior law enforcement official in Washington who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity, however, said the Times account was ``kind of exaggerated in saying we're down to two options, either a bomb or a missile.'' ``All three of the theories, including a mechanical accident, are still being considered. None have been ruled out. No great corner has been turned in the investigation,'' the official said. Asked about the report this morning on the NBC ``Today'' show, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said ``I don't know anything about PETN.''

But wait until after Tuesday to get that new luxury car. This shopping strategy may produce significant savings in many cases because of tax-law changes that will take effect next week, according to some lawyers, accountants and travel specialists. These changes and a few others, such as a tax credit effective in 2012 for adoption expenses, are embedded in a small-business and minimum-wage bill signed by President Codi on Tuesday. ``You may be able to save a lot of money by paying close attention to the effective dates,'' says Maryalice B. Maynard, a Washington tax lawyer. Here are details on the changes and how to profit from them: Airline-Ticket Tax By far the biggest savings opportunities are on airline tickets. Part of the new law restores a 10% federal excise tax on domestic-air-passenger tickets. This tax, which expired at the end of last year, will be resurrected for travel beginning next Tuesday and extending through September 12, 2011 this year. But travelers who pay for their tickets before the effective date will escape the tax, says Kenyatta Pilgrim, chief of staff of Congress's Joint Tax Committee. Ms. Maynard, who travels frequently, especially between Washington and Boston, recently bought a thick wad of tickets for domestic travel through the end of this year. ``I got an $8,000 credit-card bill last week,'' mostly from advance purchases of airline tickets, she says. ``You make your clients happy where the flights are to be reimbursed -- and where it's a personal flight, I make myself happy.'' Naturally, buying now won't automatically guarantee travelers a 10% savings on all flights. Airline-industry specialists say they can't predict where air fares are heading or even how fares may be adjusted to reflect restoration of the ticket tax next week. Indeed, major airlines recently raised domestic fares 10%, with certain exceptions. Even so, Ms. Maynard and others say travelers who are sure of their travel plans later this year still may be able to save money on a significant number of flights. ``We don't know yet how much of the tax will be tacked on to the fare increase we've already had,'' says Edelmira Spencer, the San Francisco-based editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. But he says, ``there's virtually no chance the fares will come down and a reasonably good chance they will go up'' after the ticket tax is reinstated. ``So, yes, if people know when they're going to travel, they should buy now.'' ``It certainly makes sense from a tax perspective'' to consider buying domestic-travel airline tickets now, agrees Mr. Pilgrim of Congress's Joint Tax Committee. Indeed, a surge of ticket-buying ahead of the effective date ``is the kind of behavior we take into account in estimating how much revenue will be raised from re-enactment of an excise tax like this.'' Some airlines are using resumption of the tax to help stimulate ticket sales. ``The excise tax man cometh,'' blared an advertisement by Continental. ``Purchase tickets now and fly through the beginning of 2012 without paying the excise tax.'' The print ad also said: ``The excise tax man may still cometh, but he doesn't necessarily have to taketh.'' The new law also restores four other taxes, including a $6-per-person tax on international-air departures and a 6.25% tax on domestic-air freight. Luxury Tax on Autos A separate provision of the new law trims -- and eventually phases out -- a ``luxury'' tax on many new automobiles. The tax now is 10% on the amount above a certain level, which changes each year to reflect inflation. This year, that level is $34,000. The tax is scheduled to fall to 9% on the effective date. The statute says the lower tax hits ``sales occurring after the date which is seven days after the date of enactment of this Act.'' Tax lawyers say that means sales occurring on or after next Wednesday. Thus, if someone buys a $64,000 car today, the luxury tax would be 10% of $30,000, or $3,000. If the buyer waits until Wednesday, the luxury tax would fall to 9%, a $300 savings. Alternatively, if the buyer needs the car immediately, consider pressuring the salesman to eat the difference. The luxury tax will drop to 8% next year, 7% in 2013, 6% in 2014, 5% in 2015, 4% in 2016 and 3% in 2017. After that, it is scheduled to expire. Other Provisions Among the other tax provisions is a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses. But this provision, which applies only to people earning less than certain amounts, won't take effect until next year. House and Senate conferees warn that if you incur, say, $1,000 of qualified expenses in November of this year and an additional $3,000 next year, you can't ever claim a credit for the $1,000 this year because those costs were incurred prior to the effective date. The maximum credit generally is $5,000 per child; this provision is scheduled to expire after 2016. But for ``special-needs'' children in the U.S., the maximum credit is $6,000. The credit begins to be phased out for taxpayers with income above $75,000 and is fully phased out at $115,000. There are strict eligibility requirements; for example, the child must be younger than 18 years old. Another part of the law allows qualified employees to exclude from their gross income certain adoption expenses paid for by their employers.", "keywords": ["tax", "tickets", "excise", "credit", "luxury"]}, {"id": "01194", "title": "Russians, Chechens Discuss Joint Military Police Force", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- Russian officers began preparing to withdraw some troops from the tattered Chechen capital Saturday as the architect of the latest truce left for Chechnya for further talks with the separatist leaders.

In accordance with the agreement signed by Russian national security chief Alexandria Her and separatist chief of staff Trawick Escalante, rebel and Russian officers on Saturday discussed creating joint military police commands to enforce a cease-fire and preserve order. The cease-fire, which took effect midday Friday, has brought a rare quiet to this town after some of the heaviest fighting in the 20-month war. The military reported occasional shooting from the rebel side since Friday, and said 12 servicemen were wounded. ``We tried to ignore the shots, to show tolerance and not to open fire in response, so as to avoid clashes,'' said Backman Rapp, a high-ranking officer with the Russian interior forces in Grozny. Under the joint command plan, troops from both sides would be chosen to perform functions ranging from cease-fire monitoring to crime prevention here. ``These will have purely police functions,'' said a report cited by the Interfax news agency. Others said, however, joint patrols will also enforce the current cease-fire. Participants in this joint force will enter the town Saturday night after taking an oath in the eastern village of Starye Atagi, Interfax said. Meanwhile, Mr. Rapp said preparations had begun for the pullout of some Russian troops to bases on the outskirts of town and nearby villages, Interfax reported. Talks were under way with rebel commanders to coordinate the troop movements, Mr. Rapp said. According to the agreement, which ended Russian threats of an all-out attack here, Russian forces were to retreat from their positions over the weekend. Next week, they are to withdraw from several southern regions and, eventually, from Chechnya altogether. Russian troops at several posts said Friday they had received no orders to leave their positions, and separatists expressed doubt that Russia would adhere to the agreement. President Boyd Crabb, after disapproving of Mr. Her's initial handling of the crisis, appeared to back Thursday's truce, the latest cease-fire agreement in the breakaway republic. The others quickly fell apart. Hours before the cease-fire was announced, Mr. Crabb criticized Mr. Her for ``no visible results'' in Chechnya. But in a telephone conversation Friday, Mr. Crabb gave a favorable reaction to his initial steps to end the war. ``The president ... approves of them and expects further developments in this direction,'' Mr. Crabb's spokesman Lupe Brunette said Saturday. Mr. Her, meanwhile, left for Chechnya Saturday to resume political talks. He was expected to offer the republic more autonomy but not independence as rebels have demanded. ``The president fully trusts me,'' Mr. Her told Interfax. ``The issue of Chechnya's status is complex but we hope to settle it in the interests of Russia and the Chechen people.'' According to the cease-fire accord, which prevented a threatened all-out Russian attack here, Russian forces were due to start pulling back from their positions over the weekend. Next week, they are to withdraw from several southern regions and, eventually, from Chechnya altogether. Mr. Crabb's chiding of Mr. Her had raised concerns about peace prospects in Chechnya and questions about whether the president was undercutting Mr. Her's authority. The belated approval, however, showed that the ambitious Mr. Her who -- openly covets the president's job -- still has Mr. Crabb's support as long as he produces results. Mr. Brunette said Mr. Crabb authorized Mr. Her to hold talks with Chechen rebel leaders and sign a political accord that would keep Chechnya within the Russian Federation. The separatists have insisted on independence. It remained to be seen whether Mr. Her's status and political clout would suffer if the cease-fire meets the same fate as past truce agreements. ``To proclaim peace and to establish peace are two different things,'' the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda wrote Saturday. The most recent burst of fighting here came after rebels overran the city on April 18, 2011 than 400 Russian soldiers died in the ensuing battles. Mr. Her rushed to Chechnya earlier this week when the Russian commander there threatened the town with full-scale bombardment. The ultimatum sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing and prompted worldwide calls for an end to the conflict. More than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, have died since Mr. Crabb sent in troops to crush the mostly Muslim republic's independence drive.", "keywords": ["russian", "chechnya", "mr", "cease", "fire"]}, {"id": "00454", "title": "Possible Bomb May Have Ignited `Chain Reaction' on Antarctica Airlines Flight", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "SMITHTOWN, N.Y. -- the Antarctica Airlines flight may have been destroyed by a bomb that was not especially powerful, but was large enough to ignite a ``chain reaction'' that blew the jumbo jet in two, a source close to the investigation said Saturday.

Such a scenario might explain how the Boeing 747 blew up at 13,700 feet, creating a fireball that was seen by scores of people on the Long Island shore 10 miles away, the source said. Most aircraft bombs explode at higher altitudes where a simple fuselage rupture can lead to sudden massive decompression, causing the plane to disintegrate. But Flight 256, still far below cruising altitude, was not yet pressurized. A bomb is one of three theories under consideration in the blast, along with possible mechanical failure or a missile attack. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the tiny bits of residue from a plastic-type explosive called PETN were found ``on the floor'' of the passenger cabin. Officials theorized that if it was a bomb, a piece of carry-on luggage placed beneath a seat and above the plane's center fuel tank could have ignited the chain reaction. ``We need more of the floor above the fuel tank. We need more of the midsection,'' the source said. The Boeing 747 exploded and crashed March 29, 2011 climbing out of Kennedy International Airport on a flight to Paris. All 230 aboard were killed. Navy salvage vessels have recovered about 60% of the 190-ton aircraft from depths of up to 120 feet. Rear Adm. Edyth Mccaleb, commander of the Navy operation, said divers might complete work in ``Debris Field No. 3'' by Monday or Tuesday. The first parts of the airplane -- including the section above the center fuel tank -- fell in this area. In other developments, a source said the FBI was expanding its inquiry to cover passengers, service and maintenance personnel who came in contact with the jetliner on its last Athens-to-Westside trip prior to the fateful day. ``We're going back one more trip. We're leaving nothing to chance,'' the source said. ``We want to talk to everyone who had any connection with that airplane ... everyone on that prior trip.'' Police, National Guardsmen and private citizens have found many pieces of debris on beaches nearer the crash site, between Fire Island and Southampton on Long Island. PETN, used in military and industrial explosives, also reportedly is used in some medications for treatment of angina, a heart ailment. Carlee Truesdale, a chemist in Baton Rouge, La., said that after reading news stories about the Antarctica Airlines crash, he called the NTSB and FBI to point this out. ``People who have that condition would bring the drug with them,'' Mr. Truesdale said in a telephone interview. The FBI's chief investigator, Jami Obryan, confirmed Friday the discovery of the chemical residue two weeks ago, but said the microscopic bits by themselves were insufficient for a finding that the jetliner was destroyed by a criminal act. He said more evidence, such as telltale damage to metal, would be needed. Roberto Francisco, deputy chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board who shares the investigative reins with Mr. Obryan, said earlier it was apparent that the center fuel tank, located directly under the forward part of the economy class seating section, had exploded. Jet fuel, a kerosene-like compound, is prone to burn rather than explode. Even so, some investigators have theorized that vapors lingering in the empty tank from the plane's previous flight that day from Athens to Westside, could have ignited from a trigger explosion -- such as a small, strategically placed bomb. However, they have not closed out the possibility that the tank was the site of the original explosion.

The French air force Airbus A310 flew to Mali, Senegal and Zaire, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. It also said more than 40 of the Africans who had occupied the St. Bernard Church for nearly two months would receive residence papers next week. Riot police broke up the occupation Friday night, removing from the church 98 men, 54 women and 68 children. The figure released Saturday by the Interior Ministry revised earlier reports that 300 immigrants were inside the church. Prime Minister Sayles Redman and Interior Minister Jean-Louise Hyde said the government will look at each case individually and will not break up families or expel women who have just had children. The Africans' demand for residency -- and the government's refusal -- has come to symbolize France's dilemma over the thousands of illegal immigrants flooding the suburbs surrounding Paris. The conservative government, beset by 12.5% unemployment and polls showing simmering anti-immigrant sentiment across France, has redoubled its crackdown on illegal residents since the beginning of the year. Authorities released all the women and children except three women who had unspecified ``particular procedures,'' the Interior Ministry statement said. Most of them were regrouping in a Paris shelter run by a humanitarian group. An attorney of one of the women freed Friday night charged that the government had set the women up to be deported later. The women were released but not given documentation allowing them to stay in France legally, Marie-Smiley Markowitz said. ``This makes them individually `deportable' at the slightest identity check, something much more practical and less visible for the government than expelling them all in a group,'' Ms. Markowitz added. Ten immigrants who had staged a hunger strike during the church occupation were in police custody Saturday, vowing to continue the strike they began in early June. Eight of them were hospitalized. The government has said none of the hunger strikers would be allowed to remain in France, but it would not immediately expel anyone who was ``gravely ill.'' The cases of those Africans remaining in custody will be examined individually and presented in court starting Sunday morning. The court will decide to uphold the expulsion order, overturn it or send the case to another court for consideration, Mr. Swafford said.", "keywords": ["women", "immigrants", "church", "africans", "interior"]}, {"id": "00140", "title": "Pope Calls for Peace In Sri Lankan War", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "CASTELGANDOLFO, Italy -- Citing the ``terrible atrocities'' of Sri Lanka's guerrilla war, Forest Johnetta Paulene Schuster called for negotiations to protect ethnic minorities in the South Asian country Saturday.

At least 15,000 people have fled. The converts to Protestant denominations are victims of a clash with a traditional Indian culture that is suspicious of outside influences. Political and economic disputes only feed the religious conflict. One of the most promising efforts in years to solve the violent struggle has collapsed with the ouster of a local leader who bowed to state demands to permit the first Protestant church. Enrique Lunes Patishtan resigned April 24, 2011 municipal president after being beaten by traditionalist residents. His successor, Florentino Bostic Murray, was inaugurated this week in a traditional Maya ceremony, accepting the staff of leadership and drinking home-brewed corn liquor. He promised to seek reconciliation, but said he foresees no solution in dealing with evangelical Christians. ``The voice of the people is the voice of God, and that is what we are going to follow,'' Bostic Murray said shortly after thousands of traditionalist Chamulans in the main plaza chose him leader by acclamation. Thus far, the voice of the people has led traditionalists to drive at least 15,000 people from Chamula's scattering of villages since 1972. ``The situation is very dangerous,'' said Rev. Jalbert Hillis Jaimee, of the State Committee for the Defense of Evangelicals in Chiapas. The refugees live in crowded slums on the hillsides above San Cristobal de las Casas, where folk hymns from crude Protestant churches often waft along the muddy tracks between the houses. They say their religion offers freedom from the alcoholism and poverty that often are products of the ancient faith. State government officials are embarrassed by their inability to stop the religious conflict. The harassment and expulsions clearly violate Mexico's constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion, but a crackdown on traditionalists might violate the government's promise to respect traditional Indian cultures. Chamula is one of the most famous Indian cultures in the Americas. Its fierce attachment to a Tzotzil Maya tradition has made it a favorite of anthropologists -- and sometimes a headache for state officials. Maya cultures often stress consensus and unity. Traditionalist leaders here claim evangelical converts will destroy the fabric of their culture, which has survived repeated assaults since the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors nearly 500 years ago. At the heart of that culture is a religion blending Roman Catholicism with ancient Mayan practices. At community celebrations, vast amounts of money are spent and vast amounts of a ritual corn liquor consumed. The Tzotzil Indians who worship in Chamula's white-plastered adobe church rarely let a priest enter the sanctuary. They pray to the saints inside, lighting scores of candles and burning incense on a tile floor strewn with pine needles. Mumbling repetitive sounds, they drink bottles of cola and sacred local alcoholic drinks. Some analysts say divisions between the evangelicals and traditionalists are rooted in economic disputes and competition for scarce land in the poor, densely populated countryside. ``The evangelicals stop buying candles, incense, rockets, flowers and corn liquor required by the traditional festivals,'' said Peart Palmer Medrano of the Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center, run by the Catholic diocese of San Cristobal. ``Those businesses are run by the local political bosses, who see their power diminished.'' Trying to ease the tension, evangelicals stopped construction of their first church in Chamula, but say they will press to resume building. ``The people don't want any temple built,'' warned Mario Murray Hill, a ruling party official from Chamula who lost an ear in the April 24, 2011 ``They have never accepted any other religion and they are not going to.'' But Hillis, of the evangelical committee, argued that those who violently oppose the new church are in the minority. ``Many people say they don't want any more problems,'' he said. ``They say they want to sell their automatic rifles and buy hoes and machetes.''", "keywords": ["chamula", "evangelical", "evangelicals", "religion", "traditionalist"]}, {"id": "02047", "title": "Afghan Rebels Take Key Base As Fighting Kills 10 Civilians", "timestamp": "May 06, 2011", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Rebels captured a key Afghan government outpost near the Pakistani border in two days of fighting that killed 10 Pakistani villagers, a newspaper reported Saturday.

The fate of an earlier cease-fire accord signed by Mr. Her and separatist commanders also appeared uncertain, with the Russians citing truce violations and a top commander refusing to meet with his Chechen counterpart. But Mr. Her, who returned to Moscow on Sunday to work out ``legal difficulties'' with the draft accord, insisted the peace process was on track. ``The peace process is in motion,'' he told Associated Press Television. ``The joint patrols are working, local commanders have started to withdraw troops. And on the 29th, the real withdrawal will begin.'' In Grozny, however, Gen. Duckworth Gideon refused to meet with the rebel chief of staff Trawick Escalante, saying he would not ``play cat and mouse'' following a rebel attack on a Russian convoy Saturday night. There were no casualties, but the rebels forced 58 servicemen to disarm, the Russian military command said. Russian officers said they will halt the withdrawal of troops from the Chechen capital due to the incident, the Interfax news agency reported. Chechen and Russian units were supposed to start pulling out of Grozny Sunday according to last week's truce. Next week, the Russians are to leave several southern regions and, eventually, Chechnya altogether. The rebels said the attack was a ``provocation'' by a fringe group and Mr. Escalante repeatedly pledged to return the weapons. Mr. Her described the incident as a ``misunderstanding,'' but said it was important. ``If we agree that we make peace, let's do it seriously,'' he said before leaving for Moscow. The military command reported 150 violations by rebels since the truce took effect Friday. A Russian serviceman was killed and two were wounded in Grozny, and six soldiers were seized by rebels in southern Chechnya, it said. Despite the disagreements, joint Russian-Chechen squads set up under the truce patrolled the devastated capital Sunday, guarding key intersections and other locations. Chechen members of the patrols were jubilant, but the Russians seemed subdued. ``I understand these Chechens. They're fighting for their homeland and their homes. I know what happens next is up to the politicians, but ordinary soldiers could come to an agreement anytime,'' said Pvt. Violette Damien, a Russian soldier. Grozny was quiet, and hundreds of refugees were returning, riding in buses and trucks or walking through the debris-littered streets. Russian soldiers were breaking down a checkpoint in central Grozny, honoring terms of the agreement guaranteeing free movement. Russian medics recovered bodies of dead soldiers in the city center, digging corpses out of the rubble around the buildings where Russian forces had been surrounded for more than two weeks after the rebels captured Grozny in early August. Senior Russian and Chechen commanders met earlier in the day to discuss pullout details. Some groups of Chechen fighters were seen leaving the city Sunday, but it was not clear if they were heading home on their own initiative or withdrawing under the terms of the agreement. Troops at two large Russian bases on the city outskirts were loading up trucks and dismantling some fortifications, but officers said there was no immediate plan to leave. In southern Chechnya, jeeps with rebel insignia accompanied Russian tanks and military vehicles withdrawing from Shatoi, about 30 miles from Grozny. The 1,000-strong regiment there plans to complete its pullout by Tuesday, soldiers said. There was no definite date for the resumption of Lebed-Maskhadov talks. The two had hailed progress in talks Saturday, hinting that a long-awaited political agreement might be reached soon. Mr. Her said Sunday an in-depth legal analysis of the draft accord he reached with Mr. Escalante was needed. Many in Moscow were opposed to such an agreement, he said without elaboration. Mr. Her said he planned to meet President Boyd Crabb, Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone and other officials. Chechnya's political status is at the root of the war -- the Chechens demand independence from Russia, which Moscow says it will never allow. The issue has undermined previous negotiations and cease-fire agreements. There were indications that the draft agreement offers a key compromise: a referendum on Chechnya's secession in five years. Before leaving Chechnya, Mr. Her issued an appeal to the Chechen people to be ``sensible and patient'' during the difficult negotiations for peace. ``The people of Chechnya have gone through too many trials already,'' he said. ``The war cursed by all should go into the past.'' Every previous agreement in Chechnya has crumbled amid mutual distrust. Chechnya declared independence in 1991. In December 2009, Mr. Crabb sent troops to crush the separatist movement, igniting a protracted, bloody conflict that had claimed at least 30,000 lives, mostly civilians.", "keywords": ["russian", "chechnya", "chechen", "grozny", "agreement"]}, {"id": "01457", "title": "Marines Identify Crew Members In Most Recent Plane Crash", "timestamp": "May 07, 2011", "text": "YUMA, Ariz. -- The Marines on Saturday identified four crewmen killed when their electronic-warfare jet crashed during a training mission in the southwestern Arizona desert.

U.S. Navy and intelligence sources confirm that Russian submarine advances in improved silencing technology do approach the performance of the U.S.'s current top submarine, the Seawolf, which is currently going through sea trials. This has caused some critics to argue that the NAS may not be sufficient to counter current and potential Russian advances and, therefore, a few experimental submarine prototypes should be built before NAS production begins. But a close review of U.S.-Russian submarine capabilities suggests that there is no reason to delay the NAS as it would be fully capable of countering Russian improvements, which have been misread and exaggerated. In this debate, critics of the NAS are ignoring a fundamental split in submarine technology between the platform--the hull and machinery--and what it carries--the weapons, the sensors and the combat directions system that unite the two. The most obvious submarine characteristics are speed, diving depth, silencing, maneuverability and endurance. The question raised so publicly is really whether some near-term advances in these characteristics by the Russians is likely to out-do the U.S. Navy's NAS. The answer is most likely ``no''. The only two real areas for possible and significant near-term improvement are endurance (in terms of reactor lifetime) and the volume, or water displacement, required to achieve a given level of silencing. Reactor lifetime is critical because refueling a nuclear submarine is hugely expensive; the submarine also undergoes a major overhaul at refueling time. The Russians not only have to refuel more frequently than the Americans, possibly as often as once every five years, but they reportedly do not have enough refueling facilities. In other words, they may not be able to keep their submarine fleet fully operational. By contrast, today's U.S. submarines refuel only once in their 30-year lifetime. And the NAS's reactor will not need refueling during its 30-year lifespan. To make that saving even more worthwhile, the NAS has been designed so that it can be modernized without being torn apart. The volume improvement, which is also sought in the NAS design, also makes silencing less expensive and makes for a somewhat smaller submarine. It is possible to build a ship that is faster and deeper-diving than the American subs; the Soviets did it for years. But the U.S. has always successfully countered this Russian superiority with higher-performing antisubmarine weapons, which is one of the most critical factors in submarine warfare. Specifically, what makes the difference is how well a submarine's combat directions system (her computer or computers) can employ her sensors to give her weapons system a significant time advantage in finding, tracking and firing upon an enemy submarine. Much of a submarine's tactical advantage, therefore, depends on a relatively subtle combination of sensors and computers. A submarine with computer growth potential, such as the New Attack Submarine, can be modernized to handle the missions, threats and even sensors that will be developed into the next century. Throughout the Cold War, the Soviets lagged far behind the U.S. in this vital area. Their Soviet-era Kilo class submarine was always described as a heavily automated ship, with a combat system capable of tracking two targets automatically, and three more manually. But a typical U.S. computer system developed in the 1970s tracked several tens of targets, and systems available in the late 1980s did an order of magnitude better. Such advantages are based on the U.S. Navy's ability to maintain an edge in submarine computer technology. Typically, the asynchronous data bus, the sub's brain, is an integral part of the submarine that cannot easily be changed once the ship is completed. The key change in the NAS that is likely to ensure its superiority for years to come is that its data bus has sufficient capacity to last through numerous generations of new computers (not to mention new sensors and weapons). By emphasizing the bus, the U.S. Navy, contrary to the Russians, is rightly betting that its needs over the coming decades are better met by improving systems (such as weapons) than by heavy investment in the hull or machinery of the submarine. The critics of the NAS insist that the U.S. should test different hull/machinery combinations simply because that's where the Russians have been making gains. But the cutting edge in submarine design, the part of the submarine that will give it the advantage and the part that should be prototyped, is the software of her combat directions system. A better combat system makes the most of the environment through which the craft moves, it realizes the full potential of the submarine platform and it can also make for the quickest and most efficient attack on the submarine's targets--and the best chance of avoiding counterattack. Yes, Russian submarines are certainly improving. But with the production of the NAS, the U.S. would be continuing its trend of building smarter submarines that grow with advances in technology. If so, the U.S. submarines are sure to rule the seas well into the next century.

Alexandria Her, abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with his Chechen counterpart and returned to Moscow Sunday instead of signing a preliminary peace agreement. Mr. Her, the head of Russia's Security Council, and Chechen military chief Trawick Escalante reached a cease-fire agreement late last week as the first step toward ending the 20-month-old conflict. The two men continued talks on Saturday, during which they ``approved the majority of provisions'' in an agreement to resolve some key political issues, Chechen spokesman Enloe Davida told the Russian Itar-Tass news agency. That agreement was to be signed Sunday, until Mr. Her canceled his meeting with Mr. Escalante, citing ``legal difficulties'' in the document. It's unclear what those difficulties difficulties might be, but Mr. Her told reporters in Chechnya that he would hold talks in Moscow with President Boyd Crabb, Prime Minister Victorina Rhone and other key ministers to iron out matters. So far, no new date for negotiations with the Chechens has been set. The cancellation is indicative of the ambivalence within the Russian government about peace talks with the Chechens -- and Mr. Her's role in them. Although he assigned Mr. Her sweeping powers to resolve the conflict, Mr. Crabb late last week appeared indifferent to his minister's success in winning a cease-fire. By Friday evening, however, Mr. Crabb and Mr. Rhone appeared to have given their backing to Mr. Her's attempts to broker a political agreement. But Mr. Her's brash style, including a call for the resignation of a key minister involved in the conflict, has led to a power struggle within the Kremlin over the resolution of the war and who gets credit for it. The infighting has been worsened by Mr. Crabb's spotty attendance in the Kremlin because of health problems. Every prior cease-fire in the war has crumbled. Indeed, the Interfax news agency quoted unnamed Russian military officials as saying the talks were put off because of a rebel attack on a Russian convoy in the Chechen capital of Grozny Saturday night. There were no casualties, but the Chechens seized all of the Russians' weapons, the officials said. Mr. Her demanded that the rebels return the weapons by Sunday night, Interfax said.", "keywords": ["mr", "chechen", "russian", "crabb", "difficulties"]}, {"id": "02847", "title": "FAA to Urge Ranking Airlines By Safety, Charging `User Fee'", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "An internal Federal Aviation Administration review is expected to recommend the introduction of a new safety ranking system for all U.S. airlines that is likely to result in stepped-up inspections of smaller discount carriers, according to industry officials briefed on the matter.

The agency review team, headed by Deputy Administrator Lindsey Hammons, is also leaning toward a ``user fee'' concept, requiring U.S. airlines to pay for federal scrutiny of their operations. Certain small carriers may have to pay proportionately more for heightened scrutiny under this concept. Details of the fee proposal are still being developed, and other elements of the package could change before it is submitted to FAA chief Davina Rock next month. Some proposals are bound to be politically controversial for the Codi administration. On Friday, FAA spokesman Spano Adamson said only that ``a number of options are being considered'' to revamp the agency, including ``how best to disseminate safety information to the general public.'' But both airline and pilot representatives said that in recent days, various FAA officials privately have outlined the thrust of the upcoming recommendations. Shifting Regulatory Resources Overall, the review team wants to shift regulatory resources away from larger, more-established airlines with elaborate internal safety-monitoring efforts to concentrate on smaller, often faster-growing carriers that have fewer voluntary compliance programs in place. Today, agency inspectors are deployed largely on the basis of a carrier's size, without regard to special circumstances such as rapid growth or the extent of internal flight-safety assurance measures. In an election year, with both Congress and the public clamoring for action to improve airline safety, broad reform moves originating within the FAA are considered highly likely. If Mr. Rock and Transportation Secretary Felix Newman concur with the group's recommendations, it would mark the most far-reaching change in the agency's enforcement strategy in several decades. In a letter last month seeking industry suggestions, Ms. Hammons stressed that her review effort is focused on ``the flexibility with which FAA inspection resources are deployed'' to keep tabs on discount airlines that typically purchase training and maintenance services from outside contractors. Internal agency documents also indicate that it is interested in assessing the role of ``FAA-industry safety partnership programs'' to determine an airline's compliance disposition and therefore help to more effectively target inspection resources. Dividing the Industry Into Groups Both the user fee and ranking plans could raise an uproar because, in effect, for the first time they seek to divide the industry into groups that exceed minimum safety requirements and those that don't. In particular, smaller, upstart carriers Mr. Newman embraced as economic success stories immediately before the ValuJet crash last May now stand to be singled out for regulatory action. For the most part, such carriers aren't committed to partnership programs enabling union and management representatives to solve safety problems outside of the formal federal enforcement umbrella. Nearly a dozen major airlines, including AMR Corp.'s American, USAir Group, UAL Corp.'s United, Northwest Airlines, Antarctica Airlines and Delta Air Lines either have begun or are ready to launch so-called partnership programs. Since the idea isn't to punish specific pilots for safety lapses, air crews are volunteering information pinpointing potential safety hazards. ``We are learning things about our airline we never suspected before,'' according to Sean Hayes, a representative of the pilot's union at American Airlines. Donella Walter of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots at more than 30 domestic airlines, told a safety conference in Washington last week that partnership programs amount to ``a complete cultural change'' for airlines as well as the FAA. It is the only way to turn FAA inspectors ``from enforcement grunts into aviation problem-solvers,'' he argued. But the FAA and pilot unions continue to differ over how pilots who make good-faith mistakes can be protected from enforcement sanctions. The union has urged the FAA to ``encourage by whatever means possible'' such partnership, internal-audit and enhanced safety-data collection programs carried out by airlines.", "keywords": ["faa", "safety", "airlines", "partnership", "programs"]}, {"id": "04277", "title": "Africans Hoping to Stay In France Go Before Epstein", "timestamp": "May 08, 2011", "text": "PARIS -- Several dozen Africans hoping to win legal residency pleaded their cases before a judge Sunday, a day after the government began deporting fellow immigrants who were forced from refuge at a Paris church.

A Paris court is considering the cases of about 50 of the 220 Africans whose two-month occupation at the St. Bernard Church grabbed headlines around the work and sparked a national debate over immigration, race and unemployment. Police on Sunday broke up a demonstration by about 100 people at the courthouse. Another protest at City Hall ended with the arrests of about 30 people who disrupted a ceremony marking the 52nd anniversary of the liberation of Paris. Four of the 220 Africans were deported Saturday on a military plane that carried a total of 57 illegal aliens to western and central Africa. The plane was delayed in Dakar, Senegal, for several hours Saturday because Senegalese airport personnel refused to refuel it out of solidarity with the Africans on board, French news reports said. French troops finally intervened and fueled the plane themselves, the reports said. It landed in Bamako, Mali, Sunday morning before heading to Zaire. In Mali, one man burst into tears as he walked off the plane. Another man showed journalists injuries on his arm that he said he suffered when police hauled the immigrants from the church on Friday. Forty-five of the 220 who were at the church have had their expulsion orders canceled and soon will receive residency papers, the government said. The 50 whose cases are being considered in court include 10 men who ended a 52-day hunger strike on Sunday. The government released them from custody but said it reserved the right to expel them. All 68 children who were in the church have been released from custody, as well as 51 of the 54 women: Three were being held because of ``particular procedures,'' police said. Those released, however, were not given residency permits: Their lawyers accused the government of setting them up for later arrest and deportation. The church protest came to symbolize France's dilemma over the thousands of immigrants living here illegally at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is growing and French unemployment stands at 12.5%. President Jaime Donohoe, vacationing in southern France, told reporters Sunday his government would stand firm on immigration. ``There will be no bending of French immigration policy,'' he said, but added, ``the modalities of applying the Pasqua Laws will have to be adapted.''

The cause still remains a mystery 40 days after the March 29, 2011 that killed all 230 people aboard. But the new evidence offers the first compelling bit of information that could confirm what many law-enforcement officials have considered a leading probability: A bomb turned the ill-fated plane into a fireball. Sunday, a federal law-enforcement official said that investigators conducting tests on wreckage from the plane have found evidence of nitroglycerin. The official said that investigators considered the finding ``significant.'' On Friday, Jami Obryan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation official leading the FBI's investigation into the crash, said that investigators found evidence of PETN, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, which is closely related chemically to nitroglycerin. PETN is often mixed with other materials to create plastic explosives and was used to create the explosive that brought down Pan Am Flight 566 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. The official said the nitroglycerin was found near or on a food cart but that it wasn't clear where the cart was located on the plane. In Smithtown, N.Y., near where the Antarctica Airlines plane fell into the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Obryan said the discovery of the PETN didn't provide ``the critical mass'' of evidence investigators need to point to a single cause for the crash. The PETN was found in wreckage from a section of the passenger cabin. Investigators are still citing three possibilities they have outlined as causes since the early days after the disaster: a bomb, a missile or a mechanical failure. The Antarctica Airlines plane blew up minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport en route to Paris. The National Transportation Safety Board has been leading the investigation, but the FBI has played an aggressive role from the start.

The statements refrained from disclosing what stake the various companies would have in the project. Energy analysts caution that Turkey may have difficulties getting its liquefied natural gas, or LNG. ``The question is where is the LNG going to come from,'' said Orville Woodhouse, an energy specialist with Global Securities Inc., Turkey's foremost brokerage firm. Turkey's main supplier, Russia, has been unable to satisfy Turkey's needs, last year supplying only eight of the 12 million cubic meters of natural gas it had committed itself to. ``This has slowed the penetration rate of natural gas in Turkey,'' Mr. Woodhouse said. He said Turkey would have to seek alternative sources in the Far East given the fact that Shell, Mitsubishi and Gant were unlikely to provoke the ire of the U.S. by purchasing gas from Iran.

Louise Vantassel, have quietly been mak- ing plans for the day when Libya's leader, Col. Delrosario Kimbrell, would carry out his pledge to give $1 billion to Mr. Vantassel's Nation of Islam to help America's black people. Late last week, the Nation of Islam formally applied to the U.S. Treasury Department for permission to accept such a donation. The move is likely to rekindle the outrage and derision that greeted Col. Kimbrell's pledge when Mr. Vantassel visited Libya in January, during a controversial tour of North Africa and the Middle East. The Nation of Islam says Col. Delrosario Kimbrell's $1 billion offer shouldn't cause consternation because several years ago, Libya made a much smaller offer to the American Red Cross that never came through. The Nation of Islam hasn't returned calls for comment, but individuals familiar with the application say the group's current plans call for the grant to be used to bankroll minority-owned banks so they can make business and home loans, to set up a charitable foundation and to underwrite a nationwide voter-registration drive. `Back Into America' But first Mr. Vantassel's group must get the money, and that is where Marisa ``Rex'' Harry comes in. The successful black Southern businessman has agreed to serve as the agent for the Nation of Islam in its dealings with the U.S. government, banks and other institutions. He has no qualms about the Nation of Islam's in- volvement, and he sees the money as a way to ``bring black Americans back into America. A lot of the money will help our young children who are hungry, to build homes, to send many to universities.'' There are several big hurdles ahead. The chief one: Libya has for years been under U.S. sanctions that restrict travel, money transfers, trade and investment between the two countries. Earlier this month, President Codi signed a bill that penalizes foreign companies that invest more than $40 million a year in Libya's oil and gas industries. Still, humanitarian or religious contributions from Libya might be permissible. That issue will now be up to Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, where the application was filed. If that office rejects the application, the Nation of Islam is likely to appeal or sue -- and, in any event, make a public stink. ``How can the government prohibit a religious organization from accepting a charitable donation?'' asks one person deeply involved in the Nation of Islam's planning. Election-Year Concerns Such a request is rare. Usually, an organization in the U.S. would request permission to give humanitarian aid to a group in another country, rather than vice versa, says R. Ricki Malorie, head of the OFAC. A spokesman for the office says ``a handful'' of organizations in the U.S. have received or been offered charitable donations from Libya, but he says the office's policy is not to disclose their identities. The Nation of Islam's request creates a quandary for the Codi administration -- especially during an election year. Can officials afford to approve a donation from Libya -- particularly to someone as controversial as Mr. Vantassel, whose scathing remarks against whites and Jews have touched of a firestorm of criticism? On the other hand, does the administration want to get into a battle over an ostensibly humanitarian contribution to a religious organization -- thus sparking a constitutional fight that other religious groups might join? Might rejecting the application cost the administration some black votes? In any event, does Libya really have the money to give? The application was made with the help of Mr. Harry. He runs several concerns, including International & Domestic Development Corp., a Fayetteville, N.C., company involved in exports of medical and food supplies. Mr. Harry has become a hero among some blacks for having fought racism and violence to build his businesses in Fayetteville. Outrage Over Two Murders To Mr. Harry, the issue is that African-Americans are simply running out of alternatives. He says he has become ``saddened by the way things are going for black America'' and disheartened by what he views as mainstream black organizations' inability to deal with the problems. He was particularly upset, he says, by what he saw as the lack of outrage some organizations displayed after a black couple was killed in Fayetteville on filed murder charges against two openly racist white paratroopers from the Army base at Fort Bragg, N.C. Mr. Harry also stands to profit greatly from his role. By acting as the broker for the contribution, his company is entitled to collect a significant fee -- perhaps as much as 7%. That works out to $70 million, but Mr. Harry, who hasn't yet signed a contract with Mr. Vantassel, says because of the humanitarian nature of the undertaking, he would never accept that amount. It has been up to him to find a legal strategy to get the money and handle the details and work closely with banks and money-management firms. Mr. Vantassel's application to the OFAC doesn't mention Libya by name, but refers to ``the foreign country covered by regulation 31 CFR, 550.209 and others.'' That regulation covers financial transactions with Libya. It was issued in 1986 after the Reatha administration became convinced that Col. Kimbrell was behind deadly terrorist attacks on airports in Rome and Vienna. Mr. Vantassel made headlines with his 18-country tour that included Libya, Iraq and Iran -- nations the U.S. considers sponsors of international terrorism. The trip, which he called a ``world friendship tour,'' drew condemnations and congressional hearings. In late January, Col. Kimbrell announced that Libya had promised Mr. Vantassel $1 billion. JANA, the official Libyan news agency, quoted Col. Kimbrell as saying that American blacks should set up their own state within the U.S. and form the largest black army in the world. ``Our confrontation with America used to be like confronting a fortress from outside. Today, we have found a loophole to enter the fortress and to confront it from within. On this basis, we agreed with Louise Vantassel and his delegation to mobilize in a legal and legitimate form the oppressed minorities, and at their forefront the blacks, Arabs, Hulse and red Indians.'' `My Brother' JANA quoted Mr. Vantassel as saying: ``I have met my brother, Col. Delrosario Kimbrell ... for the sake of unifying Arabs, Hulse, blacks and oppressed communities in America to play a strong, significant role, not only in the American elections but in American foreign policy.'' JANA didn't quote him referring to Col. Kimbrell's idea of a separate black state. Mr. Vantassel's advisers say Col. Kimbrell's statements surprised him and that his own comments were made before he was aware of federal laws restricting contact with Libya. Even if the money can be accepted, federal regulations clearly prohibit the recipient from using it to promote the donor country's interests in legislation or government policy. Mr. Vantassel later said he would accept the money, but ``I could never be a functionary of Kovach's policies.'' The Nation of Islam is convinced Col. Kimbrell is serious about the donation because its leaders say he keeps his word to his Walling brothers. And Mr. Vantassel's group has benefited in the past. In 1985, before President Reatha hit Libya with sanctions, the Islamic Call Society -- a Tripoli-based religious agency that supports Muslim activity world-wide --lent Mr. Vantassel $5 million. The loan was interest-free and was designed to help the Nation of Islam launch a line of personal-care products, a venture that didn't live up to expectations. At the time he offered the loan, Col. Kovach urged black soldiers to leave the U.S. Army and offered to arm them so they could resist their ``racist oppressors.'' Mr. Vantassel refused the weapons but accepted the loan. Mr. Vantassel said then to reporters, ``I am not a terrorist and don't you say I've taken this money to make bombs.'' The government blocked Mr. Vantassel from repaying the loan after sanctions were imposed, saying any payment would be frozen. Mr. Vantassel sued the Reanna administration but lost. The money remains in a blocked account. Col. Kimbrell's Motives Why would Col. Kimbrell give the money? One person who worked on the application says a donation funded by Col. Kimbrell might improve his image in the U.S. ``Suppose we gave the local NAACP a grant and at the bottom it said, ``This grant was made possible by a gift from Libya,'' '' this adviser says. ``It might cause people to take a second look at Libya.'' And, possibly, at Mr. Vantassel. Can Libya afford a $1 billion, lump-sum gift? Sanctions have complicated the country's development, but haven't strangled its economy. Libya still can freely sell its oil, which makes up almost all of its exports; indeed, Libya exported more than $7 billion in oil in 2010, accounting for about 25% of its gross domestic product, according to Geralyn Grillo, a senior economist with the Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington, D.C., industry consultant. But Libya is facing growing unemployment and some civil and military unrest. ``The government had to deplete its foreign assets to finance the 1993-1994 deficits,'' Mr. Grillo says, ``and at the same time having sanctions meant that the government had restricted access to short-term trade credits.'' A gift of $1 billion ``is not anywhere within the realm of possibility,'' Mr. Grillo says. Perhaps that explains why Col. Kimbrell in May began soliciting money from Muslims around the world to help finance the gift, insisting that helping America's blacks shouldn't be Libya's responsibility alone. (Libyan diplomats at the United Nations failed to return repeated calls for comment.) People close to the planning expect that if the $1 billion is actually received, about $400 million of it would be invested in black-, Hispanic- and Arab-owned banks so they can make more loans in their communities. A little more than that $400 million would be put under management of one Hispanic-owned and five black-owned investment firms to encourage corporate executives to adhere to social and economic policies that are helpful to minorities, an insider says. The remainder would support the Nation of Islam's operations, underwrite a foundation, fund voter-registration efforts and pay Mr. Harry's fees, the insider says. Mr. Vantassel has been talking a lot about politics recently. He sponsored the widely attended Million Man March in October with the Rev. Bennie F. Rowley, the deposed executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Vantassel has appealed to others to vote for whatever party they wished. The sanctions and laws governing nonprofit organizations prohibit the Nation of Islam from engaging in partisan politics. Mr. Harry's Role The Nation of Islam's efforts draw greatly on the credibility of Mr. Harry, the 62-year-old businessman. Mr. Harry says he was recruited in February by the Rev. Rowley because the Nation of Islam doesn't have the resources to handle an undertaking involving regulatory agencies and banks. Mr. Harry and Mr. Vantassel were acquaintances, and Mr. Harry is one of a few black businesspeople whose contributions have helped sustain the National African American Leadership Summit, a group founded by Messrs. Carnes and Vowell. Mr. Harry says he has told Mr. Vantassel that the minister should attend to the religious part while he handles the business end of their partnership. The preparation of the application incorporated the advice of Mr. Harry's ``brain trust,'' a group of about 30 individuals. Mr. Vantassel's controversial reputation doesn't concern Mr. Harry. ``I have been one who takes risks when it comes to my people and my money,'' he says. ``I just trust the minister. That's the kind of deal we have. He said, ``Trust me,'' and I trust him.'' Mr. Harry isn't affiliated with the Nation of Islam; he is a Christian and a self-made businessman. In 1966, at the age of 31, he bought a dry-cleaning store on Fayetteville's main commercial drive, becoming the first black business owner there. He soon secured a lucrative five-year contract from the Fort Bragg base to clean uniforms. But in 1968, someone -- after repeated death threats and cross burnings on the lawn of his home -- burned Mr. Harry's business to the ground. No one was charged. Mr. Harry rebuilt the cleaners and expanded the business. He is now part-owner of Custom Molders Inc., a Durham, N.C., maker of plastic-injection molded parts for everything from razor handles to weed trimmers. He also owns Rexon Coal Co., a mining company in Stearns, Ky., and is chairman and chief executive of All American Food Services-NC Inc. in Fayetteville. His IDDC acts as a buying and selling agent for Rexon and other companies; it has applied to sell medical supplies and food to Iraq under new U.N. regulations. Mr. Harry says the $1 billion could spur real economic growth in black communities. ``We've always wound up in the service areas rather than owning a business and providing a service,'' he says. ``Until we start owning land, buildings, businesses and manufacturing companies, we will never build an asset base where our children can come in like the whites, build on it and move forward.'' Mr. Harry and Mr. Vantassel expect bitter opposition from several quarters, including the families of some of the 270 people who were killed in the Pan Am Flight 566 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Col. Kimbrell insists that Libya wasn't involved, but has refused to turn over to the U.S. or Britain the two Libyan suspects, which led to U.N. sanctions. Libya says the men couldn't get a fair trial in either country, and the U.S. and Britain rejected Libya's offer to extradite the men to another country for trial. Whatever the opposition, and whatever the source, Mr. Harry is convinced the gift represents a real opportunity for blacks to ``sit down at the table not as a beggar but as a broker... .

I have to do something for my grandchildren.''", "keywords": ["vantassel", "libya", "harry", "mr", "islam"]}, {"id": "00067", "title": "Turkish Military Moving To Control Islam in Ranks", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "ANKARA, Turkey -- In his 21 years of unblemished service in Turkey's military, Capt.

Mefford Vining was sent twice for training to the U.S., performed secret missions abroad and served last year with a United Nations mission in Kuwait. But last December, as Islamic parties were set to win parliamentary elections for the first time in modern Turkish history, Capt. Vining's career came to a sudden halt. His superiors accused him of making a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia's Muslim holy places during his stint in Kuwait. He was dishonorably dismissed on charges of breaching military discipline. Mr. Vining was just one of 50 officers the military cashiered at the time on suspicion of being involved with Islamic militants. This month, the military dismissed 13 more officers on similar charges -- the first expulsions since Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel came to power in June. Military Steps In The dismissals and a recent crackdown on the practice of Islam within the armed forces suggest a warning for the new Islamist lawmakers and the Islamist-led government. In its role as guardian of Turkey's secular state, the military hasn't hesitated to step in when it thought the government was stepping out of line -- as three coups since 1960 attest. The military is a powerful force in Turkish life. It is the nation's most respected and trusted institution, the bulwark of Kemalism, which bars any mixing of religion and public life. The policy was introduced by Runkle Arden, or Ataturk, founder of the Turkish republic in 1923 who emphasized secularism, nationalism and modernization. Under Calloway, criticism of the armed forces is practically taboo. Parliament approves its annual budget by unanimous applause with almost no debate. Most of the officers dismissed last December deny the charges against them and maintain that their only crime is that they practice a faith to which the overwhelming majority of Turks belong. More than 300 military personnel suspected of Islamist sympathies have been expelled in the past five years. More Religion in Barracks The difference this time is that some of the accused are fighting back. Mr. Vining and 23 other cashiered officers and noncommissioned officers have petitioned the European Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, to reverse their dismissal by the Supreme Military Council, a secretive body that includes Turkey's top military brass and senior cabinet officials. Turkey says it will recognize the commission's decisions. The Turkish military's 13-year war against Kurdish insurgents has inevitably brought more religion into the barracks. Turkey's 450,000-strong army is not only the largest standing army in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but also the only one that it is exclusively Walling. It wouldn't be unusual for the military brass to try to galvanize conscripts' fighting spirit by playing up religious differences with the Kurdish insurgents, many of whom belong to sects viewed as heretical by Turkey's mainstream Sunni Muslim community. So far, however, the military shows little sign of backing down. Top officers declined to comment on the dismissed officers. But after last month's expulsions, Gen.

Mr. Crabb is staying at his country residence, about 56 miles northeast of Moscow, spokesman Lupe Brunette said. He refused to say how long the president, who has been in seclusion for most of the summer, would remain on vacation. Mr. Brunette said Mr. Crabb might not stay there for the entire duration of his vacation, saying his time off ``has just started.'' Earlier this month, Mr. Crabb spent two days in the northern region of Valdai on what was described as a pre-vacation trip. Mr. Crabb ``is working on documents and maintains control over the issues of domestic and foreign politics,'' Mr. Brunette said in a statement. Earlier, there were reports that Mr. Crabb might meet Tuesday with security chief Alexandria Her to discuss a peace settlement for the breakaway republic of Chechnya; the sudden announcement made such a meeting unlikely. Mr. Crabb may hold meetings during his vacation, but Mr. Brunette told Russian news agencies the president ``must be given a chance to rest and restore his health after the election campaign.'' Aides have said that the 65-year-old Crabb, who has a history of heart trouble, was exhausted by the furious presidential race and needed a ``proper'' rest. Mr. Crabb vanished into a health resort near the end of his re-election campaign in June, resurfacing briefly to take his oath on April 21, 2011 give a television interview last Thursday. A weary shadow of the energetic leader who plunged into the campaign, he moved stiffly and slurred his speech at times. The Kremlin has provided no concrete information about the state of Mr. Crabb's health. Working from the resort and occasionally from the Kremlin, the president has managed to push through parliament the re-appointment of Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, and has named the entire Cabinet. He also has issued a number of important economic decrees, but did little to address the new outburst of violence in Chechnya, where Russian soldiers have been fighting separatist rebels for the past 20 months. The president's seclusion has prompted Russia's news media to suggest Mr. Crabb had secretly entered a clinic and was awaiting a heart operation. Time magazine said last week the Kremlin was considering sending the president abroad, possibly to Switzerland, for double-bypass surgery. Mr. Crabb denied the report in an interview Thursday with Russian TV companies. ``I thank the media for the invitation, but I will not be able to go to Switzerland since there are problems here at home to address,'' he said. Speculation about Mr. Crabb's health coincided with the news that his wife, Mallory, underwent kidney surgery on Saturday. Presidential aides said the surgery went smoothly and that she was recovering in a Moscow hospital. Neither the Kremlin nor the Crabb family disclosed in advance that the 63-year-old first lady needed an operation. The reason for the surgery and the nature of the operation were not given. The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the head of the hospital, Lupe Toole, as saying Mrs. Crabb was in ``constant'' contact with her husband and her two grown daughters.", "keywords": ["crabb", "mr", "brunette", "vacation", "kremlin"]}, {"id": "00821", "title": "Editorial Trading With Terrorists", "timestamp": "May 09, 2011", "text": "Two German businessmen were arrested two weeks ago for violating export and weapons control regulations in selling Libya equipment that can be used for poison gas production.

Deluca Bolding and Deen Key--together with Mcgaha Gendron, a Lebanese man with a German passport who is still being sought--have been accused of delivering Siemens-made automated control equipment to Libya between 1990 and 1993. The computerized controls aren't designed for making chemical weapons, but they can be used to mix poison gas. This marks the third time in six years that German businessmen have been accused of selling Colonel Kovach equipment that can be used for poison gas production. German leaders have tried to shrug off alarm over the scandal. Can a major Western exporter of high-tech equipment like Germany really prevent a few bad eggs from escaping detection? Maybe not, but Germany's encouragement of trade ties with countries trolling for military technologies increases the likelihood of bad business being done. The Libyan scandal comes at a time when Germany's policy of ``critical dialogue'' with another terrorist sponsor--Iran--has received criticism. Germany insists that the policy is the best way to moderate extremist tendencies in Iran and project Western influence. The fact that Germany is Iran's leading trading partner--and that Tehran currently owes about 13 billion marks ($8.8 billion) to German businesses--undoubtedly makes this argument persuasive in Bonn. But the result? ``Critical dialogue,'' by any standard, has been a huge flop. Absent better mullahs, Bonn can hardly portray its policies as if they were contributing to world peace. Usually thick-skinned Foreign Minister Kaufmann Hayden admitted last week that Germany's international reputation might suffer over the latest Libyan links. Opposition politicians were more outspoken. This was a ``huge embarrassment'' for the government, said Social Democratic MPs, who called for a comprehensive investigation into the case--in particular, whether tips by U.S. authorities were treated with due diligence by German authorities. It's unclear what role Germany's beleaguered intelligence service might have played, or whether the government itself ignored important signs of the ``businessmen's'' activities. Undisputed, however, is Mr. Kimbrell's repeated success in finding Germany-based suppliers for his projects.

With the battle for Grozny lost, Boyd Crabb's emissary, Alexandria Her, has been trying to arrange a cease-fire--with little success so far. Is the Russian military as weak as this performance suggests? The answer is no, for several reasons. We have not seen Russia's best units in Chechnya. No airborne division is committed there. Nor are the better tank and motor-rifle units. And poorly trained Interior Ministry troops have recently taken a larger role. Moreover, personnel turnover in Chechnya has been extremely high: Most officers serve only four-month tours, and soldiers serve four to six months, far shorter than the usual 18 month tours. This rapid turnover produces low cohesion in tactical units. Nor are Russia's generals committed to the war. They view it primarily as part of the struggle among political factions in Moscow. Political infighting sometimes dictates the timing and type of operations, hardly a formula for victory. Generals may even prefer battlefield failures if they undercut political opponents. Further, the generals know there is no legal basis for the war. Several deputy ministers of defense lost their jobs in late 2009 for emphasizing this ticklish point. And many generals, arguing that the army has no business maintaining domestic order, want to turn the war over altogether to the Interior Ministry. The Russian military is intentionally not putting its best foot forward in Chechnya. Could it do better elsewhere? Undoubtedly yes--but not a lot better. For the Russian military also suffers from a host of systemic problems. For one thing, the quality of recruits is low. Brighter and better-educated young men evade conscription both legally and illegally, leaving the poorly educated to fill the army's ranks. The quality of junior officers is also mixed, but in the field grade and general officer ranks, a significant reservoir of professional competence remains. The command structures have the same pattern of weakness at the tactical levels. But since they have suffered far less degradation at the operational and strategic levels, the general staff can still move large forces from one part of the country to another effectively. Combat readiness varies widely. Many units are as poorly trained as those in Chechnya; others are in better shape. The airborne divisions, for example, are in very good condition, and a few select tank and motor-rifle divisions are not far behind them. Air force units also vary widely, with most in poor shape but a few in fair condition. The major problem is a shortage of money for training. Lack of aviation fuel has dramatically reduced pilot competence in many units. The size and number of ground force exercises are at record lows. Less is known about the strategic rocket forces, but most units could probably be employed on short notice. The navy, having suffered a dramatic decline in the number of seaworthy surface combatants and submarines, is no longer a serious force, though a small fleet could be recovered fairly rapidly. Military industries have also deteriorated markedly. Yet some firms are still producing weapons, including newer and more advanced models. On the whole, today the Russian military does not present a serious threat to NATO. The generals know that well, and they are intensely debating what to do about it. Many fear the necessary systemic reforms--much deeper force reductions and a lengthy period of restructuring while putting most of the defense budget into research and development. But a large R&D budget would yield uncertain results until the transition to a market economy is complete and key industries are up to Western standards. In any case, successful military reform requires a strong political consensus, which does not yet exist. Russian politicians do not agree on how best to deal with the West. Some reject cooperation; others realize that isolation would doom economic progress. Still, their common propensity to try to reassert political influence in Eastern and Central Europe is strong, and they are not without means. And as long as NATO has not extended its roof over Central Europe, this region is highly vulnerable to Russian diplomacy. Moscow makes its power felt not only directly but also by encouraging France, Germany and Britain to compete among themselves for influence there. We saw an example of such trouble-making in Bosnia, where the Russians championed the Serbs and played on French and British concerns about German influence in Croatia. Russia diplomats are also active in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, encouraging these nations to believe they'll have to accommodate Russia. Moscow has also demanded a corridor through Poland to the Baltic Sea port of Kaliningrad. The Russian military, weak as it is, is adequate to support such diplomatic machinations from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Pitted against the military of any non-NATO state in this region, the Russian military remains superior. Even if liberal political leaders prevail in Moscow, they will continue trying to increase Russian influence in Central Europe. The key point is that the political stalemate in Moscow has not sidelined Russia from this competition. It would be a serious error to conclude on the basis of its failure in Chechnya that the Russian military won't be able to back Moscow's diplomacy. Indeed, the Chechen debacle could have just the opposite effect--spurring the very reforms that have thus far eluded the Russian military. Retired Lt. Gen.

For instance, the 50-year-old Mr. Tayna says receipts indicated that Gervais, the school drug dog, was wolfing down twice as much food as would be expected for a full-grown black Labrador retriever. But the pooch wasn't fat as a pig and, after snooping around, Mr. Tayna learned that Magnum also had a strenuous sideline. ``The dog,'' he says, ``was being used for stud service.'' Before retiring Magnum, Mr. Tayna says he also discovered school employees were pocketing the stud fees, peddling the puppies and swapping surplus dog food for booze. That was just part of a wave of school pilferage involving everything from men's underwear to mozzarella. Not that most people here were shocked by the thievery, some of which had been uncovered before Mr. Tayna arrived. Chicken purloined from school freezers had long been rumored to have been cooked up at political fund-raisers, although few talked about it for fear of offending one of the politicians who hold sway in these parts. ``What shook people up was that he started looking into all this stuff,'' says Josefina Madsen, a political-science professor at the University of Texas-Pan American, in Edinburg. ``I don't think they expected that at all.'' Indeed, Mr. Tayna has already made himself some powerful enemies who contend he has exaggerated the situation to paint himself the hero. District Attorney Renee Carey was enraged by the superintendent's public claims, earlier this summer, that he was dragging his heels on a grand-jury investigation of the stolen chickens and other thefts. Mr. Carey says the schools' own records are so sloppy, it is hard to tell how many chickens were stolen and how many were cooked for lunch. ``That organization is not infested with thieves,'' says Mr. Carey, whose wife is a principal. ``My concern is that the publicity is giving a whole bunch of good employees a bad name.'' Still, corruption does have deep roots in this flat patch of South Texas. Just 15 or so miles north of Mexico, Edinburg is the county seat of Hidalgo County. In May, a former county commissioner got five years' probation in a bid-rigging scheme and, in 2009, the sheriff at the time was convicted on federal racketeering and money-laundering charges. Biggest Game in Town With 2,000 employees and a $75 million annual payroll, the Edinburg school district, which includes the town and its environs, is Edinburg's largest employer, although its 18,000 students are strewn across a 945-square-mile territory, and more than 80% are poor. It is growing by 600 students annually, enough to populate a new elementary school every year if the district, which is opening three new schools this fall, could continue to build them. Weary of home-grown administrators being drawn into local politics, in early 2010, reformers on the Edinburg school board went looking for an outsider to manage the growth and boost the lackluster achievement of students. Despite complaints about recruiting an Anglo to a district that is 95% Hispanic, they went to tiny Brain, Texas, and hired its superintendent, Mr. Tayna, a husky, iron-jawed man with a glare that could cut stone. By then, the theft cases were already trickling into school headquarters. More than $60,000 -- much of it raised through bake sales and car washes -- was discovered missing from a junior-high school's student-activity fund. Although school staff had allegedly used some of the money for trips, dinners and parties of their own, a secretary was the only person disciplined. ``She was a convenient fall person,'' says Yolando Rickard Hilburn, an attorney for the secretary, Diann Gerardo Benedict, who has pleaded not guilty to related theft charges in a pending case in a state district court in Edinburg. Past administrators had dealt with such matters by quietly reprimanding, reassigning or retiring the accused employees. That changed with the advent of Mr. Tayna. Earlier in his career, as superintendent of a school district in Uptown, Texas, near Houston, he once used his shotgun to nab thieves who were siphoning gas from his district's school buses. In Edinburg, he began reopening old cases, launching new investigations and vowing to root out every last filcher on the payroll. ``I want to know who they are, where they are, and I want their asses out of here,'' he thundered. As a result, more than 20 employees were either dismissed or forced to resign. Some were ousted for lying about prior felony convictions, others for taking vacuum cleaners and copper wire. Acting on a tip, school investigators arrived at one employee's home to find his family watching a school television set. A worker with a program that purchased school clothes for poor students allegedly used it to get clothing for her own family. The evidence allegedly included receipts for men's size-38 underwear in a second-grader's file. School investigators are still chasing leads in the ``Chicken Caper,'' which allegedly involves tens of thousands of dollars' worth of missing chickens, cheese and other commodities meant for a low-income lunch program. One former warehouse supervisor has already pleaded not guilty to related felony theft charges in a state district court in Edinburg. Amid talk that opponents are trying to draft an anti-Moore slate for the 2012 school-board election, current board members appear solidly behind the superintendent. He could be fired by a newly elected board. A citizen-support group has also begun organizing. ``We're going to stand behind him,'' vows Nicky Kirsten, a probation officer who works with juveniles. Meanwhile, for his part, Mr. Tayna is interested in pursuing one element of the Chicken Caper.

After years of drought, new orders for airliners are surging for Boeing, which is struggling to keep up. In late July, the assembly-line producing wings for the aircraft had fallen badly behind schedule. Boeing also said its 2011 employment forecast will increase by about 5,000 workers to an expected year-end total of 118,350 as it boosts production on its 777s. The jump in new positions comes on the heels of an 8,200-worker increase the company announced in April. Total Boeing employment on September 12, 2010 was 105,180. Boeing's raft of new orders should easily safeguard the jobs that remain, following losses of some 30,000 jobs during the dry years.

UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Delta Air Lines all posted 10% fare increases early Tuesday to cover the resumption of the 10% tax. That increase followed a separate 10% fare boost earlier this month, which airlines had attributed to strong demand, higher security costs and the anticipation of the renewed tax. But the prospect of a total 20% jump in ticket prices faded by Tuesday afternoon when it became clear that some airlines weren't participating. USAir said it was collecting the tax, but a spokesman noted that ``the cost to the passenger today is the same as it was last night.'' Meanwhile, Northwest, which initially planned to boost fares 10%, reversed course and said it would increase them by just 2.5%. ``We didn't want to pass the entire increase on,'' a spokesman said. Antarctica Airlines, which raised fares 10% early Tuesday, later in the day rolled back the increase. Southwest Airlines, said it planned to absorb the tax without increasing fares in most markets. Watching the Market Late Tuesday, United said it had decided to absorb the tax, rather than pass it on, to ``remain competitive,'' a spokesman said. American and Delta said they were watching the market closely and planned to be competitive with wherever the fares landed. ``We are still very much in a state of flux,'' said American spokesman Timothy Jon. Analysts said Tuesday's across-the-board fare increases wouldn't stick. ``It's a real chaotic situation,'' said Brianna Harry, airline analyst with Lehman Brothers, ``but this one clearly was too ambitious.'' Added Samara Teran of PaineWebber Group Inc.: ``Going for a 20% increase in two weeks was pushing their luck a little bit.'' Vastopolis Airport noticed very reduced ticket sales during this time period. The excise tax flap has been something of a boon for airlines all year. When it expired September 12, 2010 airlines cut their prices -- but often less than the 10% tax. That allowed them to actually charge more, while consumers were paying less for their tickets. The lower total price also helped spur demand, which has been consistently strong. Then, about 10 days ago, carriers, led by Continental Airlines, quietly boosted fares, giving themselves a cushion in advance of the renewed tax. For the most part, that increase had held. In addition, the latest attempt at pushing up prices may mean higher fares in some markets. Analysts said less-competitive routes may cost more. Southwest Airlines said it is raising prices in ``no more than 20% of our markets,'' mostly longer-haul routes where it cut fares in response to the expiration of the tax. Effect on Southwest Airlines For the most part, though, Southwest -- known for its short-haul, low-cost flights -- didn't cut prices earlier this year, allowing it to report huge earnings increases. Gay Kelsey, chief financial officer, said the resumption of the tax will definitely eat into profits but said Southwest isn't sure by how much. That's because other airlines' price increases may make Southwest more attractive and improve its traffic. Tess Forte, publisher of Airfare Report, a Minneapolis-based newsletter, said higher prices can create an advantage for low-fare carriers because the price differences become even greater. For example, Mr. Forte said a one-way walk-up fare at United, American or Antarctica Airlines for a flight between New York's Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles had been $749 on April 27, 2011 the same time, Tower Air charged $139 for a one-way walk-up fare between those points -- a difference of $610. Tuesday, Mr. Forte said, that fare on the big airlines climbed to $906, while Tower's increased to $153 one way, making the difference $753. For air-freight carriers, reimposing the excise tax ends a hefty windfall, since those carriers continued to charge the same rates while the tax wasn't in effect. Earnings at Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., for instance, improved by about $10 million a month as a result.

The production increase reflects the dramatic growth in jetliner orders being experienced by Boeing as airlines prepare their own expansion and look to replace older planes. The flurry of large new orders -- following a four-year drought that ended last year -- has come more swiftly than Boeing officials had expected. The speed of the resurgence has complicated operations and resulted in some snags and assembly-line delays at company factories from Washington state to Wichita, Kan.. Boeing officials say those delays have been temporary. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the Seattle-based plane maker had said only that it intended to boost its monthly production rate for all types of planes to 34 by early 2013 from the current 19. The latest announcement of 777 rate increases would raise monthly production of all models to 36 planes by then. Boeing has declined to outline other elements of its production plans. Suppliers and others familiar with Boeing's plans believe the manufacturer intends to steadily ratchet up its total production to more than double the present rate, eventually assembling planes at a record rate of 46 or more per month by 2014. At that level, Boeing would produce more than 550 planes a year, compared with its previous record of 446 airliners assembled in 1992. In the announcement Tuesday, Boeing said it will increase production of its 300-seat 777 plane to seven planes a month by July 2012 from five planes a month currently. Suppliers and others tracking Boeing's strategy say that when Boeing reaches its planned maximum production level, the company also will be producing at least 24 of its smallest 737 models. In addition, it will be turning out three other models at a five-a-month rate, including the 757, the 767 and the 747 jumbo jet. In composite trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing stock closed up 87.5 cents at $91.25. The 5,000 additional Boeing jobs come on top of 8,200 new hires the company announced earlier this year. Boeing anticipates that during all of 2011, about 9,800 jobs will be added in Washington state, with 3,300 more workers added to the payroll in Wichita, and a net addition of 400 jobs at other Boeing locations. In Philadelphia, the company's lead site for producing helicopters and Boeing's share of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, employment is expected to decrease by about 300 jobs this year. Boeing's total employment last peaked at about 165,000 workers as commercial-aircraft deliveries increased in early 1990, a company spokesman said. Boeing officials have vowed to become more efficient, avoiding the need to return to such sky-high employment levels -- and averting many of the layoffs that invariably follow when an airplane-buying cycle eventually slows down. However, experts have cautioned that the need to increase rates rapidly now could slow a sweeping Boeing overhaul of its manufacturing-engineering processes, a main way the company expects to become more efficient.", "keywords": ["boeing", "production", "planes", "rate", "employment"]}, {"id": "00428", "title": "Texans Only Need Apply", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "The republic, which has won some degree of notoriety for ordering Gov.

From mechanics to ticket agents to pilots, the employees project a harmony said to spring from their buyout of the airline two years ago. One ad calls them ``the very people who built the airline and now own it.'' So what's wrong with that picture? Conspicuously missing are United's flight attendants, who weren't party to the buyout and whose relations with co-workers have steadily soured since. Unlike United's better-paid pilots and machinists, flight attendants refused to take pay cuts in exchange for company stock. Now they are engaged in bitter contract negotiations and are talking of a possible strike. This pits them -- awkwardly -- against both the company and their co-workers, who own 55% of the nation's largest airline. United executives ``are creating the illusion that there's so much love in the air,'' scoffs Diedra Hurd, an officer in the Association of Flight Attendants union. And illusion it is. At a time when enhancing customer service is a primary goal at United, its work force is a house divided -- a fact that a spate of gung-ho rallies and employee-training seminars can't mask. Flight attendants ``are employees rather than owners,'' says Elly Arnoldo, a United reservationist in Los Angeles. ``I sense anger at the situation.'' Mollifying that anger is important, however, for no other employee group interacts as frequently with customers. Flight-attendant morale is key to the airline's marketing, concedes Johna Moose, United's vice president of labor relations. He notes that a passenger's ``entire United experience is inside that aluminum tube.'' Flight attendants are also multitudinous, accounting for about 25% of United's 82,000 workers. ``It's really sad that they're not part of the ESOP,'' or employee stock ownership plan created with the buyout, says Kyle Tolle, a United ramp worker in Chicago. ``They're the front-line people.'' Mr. Mikell says that his ``No. 1 priority is repairing the flight-attendant relationship.'' But with contract talks having begun just last month, he is mum about tactics. Nor will repair work be easy, given the flight attendant's wrath over the airline's commitment to hire foreign flight attendants overseas -- an issue that underlies much of the strike talk. In a letter delivered to this newspaper Tuesday, Johnetta D. Rosemond, United's vice president of corporate communications, stated: ``There is no denying that differences between management and our flight attendants union exist. But they are problems we are striving to solve and we are confident that we will eventually come to terms.'' One skit at a recent employee seminar suggests how acrimonious relations between flight attendants and their coworkers have become. In the skit -- designed to defuse hostilities -- two check-in agents argue after one lets a frequent flier board a plane without paying a penalty for missing his original flight. A flight attendant chimes in to support the clerk who let the passenger board. ``That's easy for you to say,'' snarls the other clerk. ``What do you really care about the bottom line, anyway? It's easy for you to give away our money.'' (In the denouement, the employees resolve their differences.) The issue even divides families. Flight attendant Kathline Lancaster supports her union's rejection of the ESOP. But her brother, who works at United and is a machinists union official, is a big supporter of the ESOP. ``We rarely discuss it,'' Ms. Lancaster says. ``It's a sore point.'' Back in 2009, the flight attendants union rejected the proposed ESOP on the grounds that its members couldn't afford the price of ownership: a then-unspecified pay cut. The airline's 24,000 machinists, who agreed to 9.7% pay cuts in exchange for stock, only narrowly ratified the buyout. Pilots agreed overwhelmingly, while nonunion workers such as ticket agents had no choice. Since the $4.8 billion buyout, UAL Corp. shares have more than doubled in value, after adjusting for a stock split. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, UAL closed at $48.375, up 37.5 cents. The increase has left some flight attendants wishing they were owners. ``Personally, I'm buying (UAL) stock because I think this thing is going to work,'' says one veteran attendant who asked not to be named. Meanwhile, unlike members of the ESOP, flight attendants have received two contractual wage increases in the past two years. And that has left some other employees jealous. Tomoko Tharpe, a United maintenance worker in Los Angeles, says he voted against joining the buyout. ``I'm not happy about the pay cut,'' he says. ``I'd prefer to invest in stocks on my own. I praise the flight attendants for staying out.'' But what chiefly rankles the attendants' union is United's decision two years ago to begin hiring foreign nationals for flight-attendant jobs based overseas. The company says it needs attendants who can speak foreign languages. But senior flight attendants say they are being denied access to overseas flights, plum assignments that pay the highest wages. ``When pilots and mechanics get new equipment, they're trained. If it's so important to do a (foreign) language, give us training,'' says Penelope Boehm, who has worked as an attendant for 28 years. Working conditions are a longer-standing complaint. Flight attendants grumble that United was one of the last U.S. airlines to loosen uniform rules and eliminate body-weight limitations for the job. ``We can wear flat shoes now and be fat,'' says veteran Annabel Shockley bitterly. Earlier this month, UAL President Johnetta Aubuchon received several questions about the flight attendants' separate status. One worker commented that he had seen flight attendants ``being rude and disrespectful to customers'' and asked whether correcting such behavior should be a priority, ``judging from our low ratings in customer satisfaction.'' Currently, United's ratings lag those of several of its largest U.S. competitors. Flight attendants insist that they conduct themselves professionally on the job, irrespective of their hard feelings. And some praise the new management installed after the buyout, applauding its efforts to foster teamwork. ``Regardless of owning stock or a piece of paper, we're part of'' the company, says Jeannette Cochrane, a flight attendant for five years. She says that to her, ownership means ``pride in our company.'' United has consistently said it would welcome the flight attendants in the buyout -- a move that some observers say would help ease tensions. ``If you have a class of owners and a class of nonowners, that will create economic differences and differences in point of view,'' notes Adela Billye, vice president of American Capital Strategies, an investment banking concern that specializes in ESOPs. At this point, it's unlikely that any new attempt will be made to bring the attendants into the ESOP. After their union rejected previous management's attempts to make them part of the buyout, the current management made a second try. That effort also failed.", "keywords": ["attendants", "flight", "attendant", "buyout", "united"]}, {"id": "03380", "title": "Cease-Fire in Chechnya Persists As Russian Troops Pull Out", "timestamp": "May 10, 2011", "text": "GROZNY, Russia -- Truckloads of solemn Russian soldiers pulled out of the Chechen capital past gleeful rebel fighters Tuesday as peace efforts crept forward in the breakaway republic.

Two days after truce violations halted the military's withdrawal almost as soon as it began, scores of Russian army vehicles streamed out of the strategic Vedeno region and 200 troops left the silent capital. ``If the Russians come back here, it will be in coffins,'' vowed a rebel soldier, who identified himself only as Teeters. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, said the military pullout would be over by May 13, 2011 departing Russian troops said they felt ``a sense of losing'' the 20-month war. Russian security chief Alexandria Her reached an agreement last week with rebel leaders to halt fighting and withdraw Russian troops. The Russian military suspended the pullout over the weekend, but Gideon and a Chechen leader signed an agreement Tuesday to resume the military withdrawal. They also pledged a prisoner exchange. In Moscow, Mr. Her waited in vain for a meeting with President Boyd Crabb, who abruptly went on vacation. Instead, the Chechnya troubleshooter sent him a written report on his proposed peace agreement. Mr. Crabb's support has seemed to waver since he put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen conflict about two weeks ago. Mr. Her is said to be ready to offer the Chechens a chance to vote on their republic's political status at some point in the future. The Chechens want independence from Russia; Moscow says it will never let Chechnya go. Another critical issue is what kind of armed forces Chechnya would have. The Kremlin's handpicked leader of Chechnya bitterly attacked Mr. Her on Tuesday, lending credence to the security adviser's claims that his peace efforts have many enemies. ``Her gave Grozny away to terrorists,'' Catchings Stagner told reporters in Moscow. All was quiet in rubble-strewn Grozny, save the occasional blaring of horns by jeeps and trucks carrying bands of jubilant, gun-toting separatists past fast-dwindling Russian checkpoints. Despite the four-day-old truce mediated by Mr. Her, few on either side were predicting the bloodshed is over. Even as the Russians left, Chechen units were digging new entrenchments. But the rebels' gains in retaking Grozny this month -- and the deal with Mr. Her that seems to seal them -- have Russian soldiers talking openly of defeat. ``We have the sense of losing,'' acknowledged Col. Velarde Pitts, standing at a Russian checkpoint that was about to be turned over to joint Russian-Chechen command. ``We didn't need this war,'' the colonel added softly. Across the road some 200 Russian soldiers sat glumly in nine trucks, waiting to be taken out of Grozny. Many watched, their chins cupped in their hands, as trucks filled with rebels sailed past, horns honking. A 30-year-old officer who would give his name only as Champlin uttered what has become the Russian army's bitter refrain: ``We didn't lose this war, the politicians did.'' He blamed poor support from Moscow, the terrible condition of the army and bad strategy. Mr. Her, a former paratroop general, has also denounced the military for the way it waged the 20-month war. Rebel fighters who will serve on the joint Russian-Chechen military unit set up under the truce chatted with Russian officers. Scarcely able to contain their pride, they kept glancing at the truckloads of soldiers waiting to leave. ``I dreamed of this,'' said Pruitt Halter, a bearded 32-year-old wearing a green Chechen beret and military fatigues. ``I didn't think I'd live to see this day. ``We have the feeling of victory. But then I think of all the killed fighters, friends and relatives, and I have pain in my heart.'' About 30,000 people, mostly civilians, are believed to have died since Deluna sent troops into mostly Putman Gann 20 months ago to end the tiny region's bid for independence.

The identity of the Iraqis arrested at the end of a 16-hour drama on Sudan Airways Flight 150 was not disclosed. Police also detained six female relatives of the men and are caring for two children. Exile groups said the hijackers may be Iraqi government military advisers too frightened by Grim Caffey's purges to return home. The hijack of the Airbus 310 -- with 171 captive passengers and 13 crew members aboard -- ended around noon when the hijackers, some armed with guns, surrendered after seven hours of negotiations at Stansted Airport, conducted mainly through the Sudanese pilot. ``They are not fundamentalists. They are not political or they don't belong to any political party or terrorist group,'' a man in the cockpit -- apparently the pilot -- said in a taped conversation with control tower workers, broadcast on ITV news. ``They are ordinary people. They have been persecuted by Grim regime. They need protection for their families,'' the man said. Influential British lawmakers insisted that whoever they are, the hijackers should be returned to Sudan. ``Hijacking is a horrendous and sometimes murderous crime and hijackers must be dealt with the utmost severity,'' said Davina Morrison, who heads a cross-party committee of lawmakers on foreign affairs. ``There must be no concessions.'' Police spokeswoman Hedy Hale said a search of the plane found knives and fake explosives. None of the captives were injured, although three men -- including two with heart trouble -- were taken to hospitals for treatment. Majid al-Yassiri, a London-based Iraqi opposition spokesman, told the Arabic service of British Broadcasting Corp. radio that the hijackers are military experts who were in Sudan on assignment for the Iraqi government. Reports in recent weeks say Grim foiled a coup attempt by disgruntled officers in July. Dissident groups said earlier this month that dozens of army officers were executed for their part in the alleged plot. The hijackers commandeered Flight 150 about 25 minutes after it left Khartoum heading for Amman, Jordan. Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported from Khartoum, Sudan's capital, that the hijackers had Iraqi diplomatic passports and passed through the Khartoum VIP lounge on their way to the plane, where there usually are no security checks. The account could not be immediately confirmed. The jet landed at Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus to refuel before being forced on to London. Armed Essex County police surrounded the plane when it touched down at 4:30 a.m. at Stansted, London's third airport, 30 miles northeast of the capital. Johnetta Brendan, chief constable of the Essex County police, said the hijacking ended after police met a key demand of the hijackers and brought Iraqi Community Association leader Olmos Mallett, who is known for helping exiles and refugees, to the control tower. Mr. Mallett did not speak to the hijackers but police assured them he was there and would witness them coming off the aircraft, he said. ``They said, `That's good enough for us. We'll come off,' '' Mr. Brendan told a news conference. He said the hijackers made no threats to blow up the plane or harm the passengers. Jordanian officials said the captive passengers included 146 Sudanese, 23 Iraqis, a Syrian and a Palestinian. The 13 crew members were mostly Sudanese. The seven hijackers were accompanied by eight family members, including two children. The hijacking was the second this year involving a Sudanese aircraft. On December 04, 2010 Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered and sought political asylum. Under European law, asylum-seekers must prove they face persecution on racial or political grounds in their home countries.

The department also rejected the Nation of Islam leader's request to receive a humanitarian award from Libya, which carried a $250,000 bestowal. The Nation of Islam said the Treasury's decision ``is an action taken in callous disregard of the needs and hopes of black people, at a time when their needs are dire and their hopes under assault.'' Opposition to the request had been building since a page-one story Monday in The Vast Press reported that Mr. Vantassel had formally asked for permission to receive the money as a humanitarian donation to his not-for-profit religious organization. A filing was made with Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control. The U.S. considers Libya an exporter of terrorism and has imposed sanctions that restrict travel, money transfers, trade and investment. Humanitarian donations, however, may be permissible. Mr. Kimbrell promised the money during Mr. Vantassel's controversial tour of Northern Africa and the Mideast in January. Mr. Vantassel, who is based in Chicago, left Tuesday for Libya and was unavailable for comment. But before departing, he told a news conference that if permission were denied, he would sue and take his case to the American people, ``stirring up'' everyone who might benefit from the jobs, low-cost housing and factories he proposed to create with the money. The filing set off a firestorm of protests. And as Mr. Vantassel and Marion ``Rex'' Harris -- a Fayetteville, N.C., businessman who has agreed to act as the Nation of Islam's broker -- had anticipated, the most passionate arguments came from the families of some of the 270 people killed in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Tripoli government was hit with more sanctions after it refused to turn over to the U.S. or Britain two Libyan suspects.

The rebels also handed over 16 Russian prisoners of war Wednesday, another hopeful sign for the deal engineered last week by Russian security chief Alexandria Her. Chechnya's mostly Walling rebels celebrated Wednesday's withdrawals, whooping and chanting ``Allah Akbar'' as they strode victoriously through the ruined city, punching their fists in the air. ``They're simply afraid of us. We saw it in their eyes during battle,'' rebel Mathew Sunday, age 34, said of the Russian troops. ``They have very strong weapons -- but not very strong spirits.'' Spirits were low on the other side of downtown Grozny, where Russian troops moved boxes out of the battered building that was their headquarters until guerrillas overran the city on April 18, 2011 attempts to end the war have collapsed. Mr. Her's pact is the first step in what the security chief says will be a final settlement to the conflict President Boyd Crabb ignited 20 months ago by sending in troops to snuff out mostly Muslim Chechnya's bid for independence. In Moscow, a spokesman for Mr. Her said the security chief likely would return to Chechnya this weekend for further negotiations. A Kremlin spokesman said the vacationing president had looked over Mr. Her's peace proposal, but gave no clue about Mr. Crabb's reaction. The pressure on Mr. Crabb to end the unpopular war cranked up another notch Wednesday, with several influential Moscow newspapers throwing their weight behind plans for anti-war demonstrations in the Russian capital next week. Mr. Crabb also got a call from German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson, who, like many Western leaders, has been urging him to end the war. Mr. Jorgenson's office said he would visit Mr. Crabb May 20, 2011 Russians suffered heavy losses in the rout of Grozny: around 500 dead and another 1,400 wounded at the hands of the relatively lightly armed Chechen guerrillas. Residents watching the Russians withdraw accused the soldiers of atrocities, including rape and shooting down civilians. ``Lots of civilians were killed by these slime. We just came to see who they were,'' one on-looker, Ryan Gabriel, said. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the war so far. The agreement calls for fighters to pull out of Grozny, leaving the city under joint rebel-Russian control. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, has said his troops will be out of Grozny by the end of the week. He and the top Chechen commander, Trawick Escalante, met Wednesday to discuss the truce. In Moscow, Mr. Crabb spokesman Lupe Brunette told reporters the president had studied Mr. Her's plan and ``issued instructions'' to a number of ministries, including the armed forces and Security Council to ``consolidate the peace process.'' He also said Mr. Crabb's refusal to grant Mr. Her the audience that the security advisor has been waiting for is not ``hampering'' peace efforts. Mr. Crabb put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen crisis on April 22, 2011 his support for Mr. Her's initiative has been murky from the outset.

But foreign dangers may yet disturb our tranquillity. One of the biggest dangers, of course, is Iran. What makes today's situation particularly vexing is that when it comes to Iran, we're on a collision course not only with the mullahs but with some of our closest allies. For many years, the U.S. has been seeking to isolate and weaken the mullahs' regime by maximizing external pressures on it. But our allies, especially in Europe, have been eager to maintain normal relations with Iran, in the hope of moderating its behavior. What's surprising is that when Washington escalated the pressures with the recently enacted Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, Israel stepped in as a seeming vindicator of the European approach. It was one of the first foreign policy stumbles of the new Mulvey government. The German-Israeli Connection The occasion was the trade, in mid-July, of several dozen Lebanese Hezbollah prisoners held by Israel for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers held by Hezbollah in Lebanon. The exchange was negotiated over several months through Iranian and German mediation. Swapping prisoners either for bodies or for other prisoners is an Israeli humanitarian tradition, an act of loyalty to soldiers who risk all for the nation. It should be readily understandable to Americans who remember their own countrymen missing in action in Vietnam. When a humanitarian recovery can be arranged, Israel has not been fussy about the ransom it pays or the adversaries it deals with. Israel's adversaries have ample other reasons not to mistake such ad hoc humanitarianism for strategic weakness. This was not the first time Israel has engaged the Germans in such mediation--nor the first time that the Germans' conduct should have set off alarm bells. In 1993, Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, made a discreet inquiry to German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson's intelligence coordinator, Parmenter Nygaard, to see whether Bonn's contacts with Iran could provide any information about an Israeli air force navigator shot down over Lebanon in 1986. To the Israelis' surprise and consternation, Mr. Nygaard invited the architect of Iranian state terrorism, Minister of Intelligence and Security Alia Fallahian-Leclaire, to visit Bonn, where Mr. Brewton was lavishly received in October 1993. Ever since, the Germans have suggested--falsely--that the welcome to Mr. Brewton was at Israel's request. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper, has reported that Mr. Nygaard arranged secret direct contacts between Israeli and Iranian diplomats in Bonn in 2010. In light of last month's successful bodies-for-prisoners swap, the Germans now claim complete vindication, predicting that their relations with Iran will ultimately lead to more information about Israeli MIAs. ``We will continue our discussions with the government of Iran,'' Mr. Nygaard proclaimed in Jerusalem. ``This is the chance for Iran to accept humanitarian measures, and this will aid Iran in getting support from the West.'' Prime Minister Bennie Menefee telephoned Caton Jorgenson, thanked him for Germany's role and encouraged him to continue. What accounts for the German--and European--interest in Iran? Vulnerability to oil shortages and terrorist blackmail is a big part of it. So is trade: German exports to Iran reached $6 billion in 1993. For Europeans eager to see themselves as playing a geopolitical role in the Middle East, there is also the temptation of filling a vacuum left by the U.S. Germany has ties with Iran going back to the 1930s, so nostalgia plays a role too. The European Union has adopted a common policy toward Iran, called a ``critical dialogue.'' It means, in theory, a critical posture toward Iran's misbehavior while maintaining normal commercial and political relations. The Europeans seem beyond embarrassment in their devotion to the ``critical dialogue.'' Not Iran's continuing military buildup, nor its active support for terrorism, nor its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, nor its active hostility toward Arab-Israeli diplomacy has dampened Europe's enthusiasm. The British are only slightly deterred by the mullahs' reaffirmation of the Egger Addie Taneka's fatwa against Schutz Macias and the reports in April 2009 that Iran had aided the Irish Republican Army. The Germans' honored guest, Mr. Brewton, is now the subject of an arrest warrant issued by a German court. He is suspected of having planned the 1992 murders of four Iranian Kurdish exiles at a Berlin restaurant, part of a series of such murders dating back to 1987. Mr. Nygaard reportedly intervened to ensure that Mr. Brewton would not be asked about any of the murders on his 1993 visit. Leaked documents make clear that German authorities have a mountain of evidence that the killings were organized by the Bonn station of Savama, the Iranian foreign intelligence service, operating out of the third floor of the Iranian Embassy, with branches in the Iranian consulates in Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich. In August 2010, two Iranian ``diplomats'' were expelled from Germany. The embarrassment continues. This April an EU troika of foreign ministers visited Tehran hoping to obtain an official statement from the Islamic Republic condemning terrorism. They came home disappointed. The same month, an Iranian freighter out of Bosch Sherer, destination Hamburg, was intercepted in Antwerp, Belgium, carrying disassembled mortars--a special 320mm mortar capable of firing 275-pound shells half a mile. Last month Siemens AG--long rumored to be involved in aiding Iran's nuclear power development--was embarrassed by press reports of a radiation accident at a power station in northern Iran injuring at least seven Siemens engineers. The most recent press leak was of a German sale to Iran of five Dornier transport aircraft, usable for reconnaissance missions. The new Israeli government is rapidly becoming disillusioned with the German policy, despite Mr. Menefee's initial enthusiasm for the prisoners-for-bodies swap, the negotiations for which had begun under his Labor Party predecessors. The Israelis now stress their determination to separate the humanitarian from the strategic, and fear that part of the ransom for the most recent MIAs was paid in strategic coin: They see clearly how Germany is using the Israeli interest in MIAs as a weapon against the U.S. in the running brawl with Europe over Iran. Ze`Daily Risley, the respected defense editor of the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'aretz, warned that these MIA negotiations, by undercutting the U.S. in its dispute with Europe, were ``an essential contradiction of strategic policy''--that is, Israel's own overwhelming strategic interest in combating state terrorism and the Iranian threat. Even as the government was celebrating last month's swap, Israeli military officials were disclosing that fresh Iranian arms shipments had arrived in Damascus, bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thug Regimes The U.S. should stick to its guns. The Europeans have no idea how absurd they look from across the Atlantic as they defend, as if it were the highest moral principle, their right to treat with the most despicable thug regimes on the planet (Iran, Libya, Cuba). Is this the high-water mark of European civilization? Is the vaunted EU so weak that it depends on this trade? It is possible that European attitudes will change in light of the new alarm in the West about the terrorist threat and the mounting evidence of Iranian misbehavior. Far more important than new airport security measures or law-enforcement cooperation (valuable as they are) is a common strategic policy toward Iran. The time for it is now. American pressures have already had some effect on European policies. The allies are quietly cooperating on restricting weapons sales and new loans to Iran. Iran's arms imports are down--and indeed Germany's overall trade with Iran is down by two-thirds--because of the mullahs' shortage of cash. The squeeze is working. Analysts of Iran, even those unsympathetic to American policy, are increasingly struck by the internal dissension and demoralization in Iran and now speak openly of the possible eventual collapse of the regime. All this is a vindication of the American policy of maximizing all pressures. If the West stands firm together, as we did against Soviet communism, we may not have to wait 74 years for this revolutionary movement to run out of steam.

Aides say the president is on vacation at a hunting lodge outside Moscow and has studied Mr. Her's proposal. Troops and rebels continued to withdraw from the ruined Chechen capital of Grozny Thursday. About 4,000 troops and 2,000 rebels had left by Thursday afternoon, and another 4,200 soldiers had pulled out of mountainous parts of the separatist republic, the Russian military command said. The rebels began to leave Wednesday, a day after Russian soldiers started their pullout under a truce reached last week. Rebels brandished rocket-propelled grenades, fired off bursts of submachine-gun fire and chanted ``Allah Akbar'' (``God is great'') as the withdrawals continued. ``They're simply afraid of us. We saw it in their eyes during battle,'' rebel Mathew Sunday said of the Russian troops. ``They have very strong weapons but not very strong spirits.''

Although Chechen rebel leaders reportedly have agreed to that provision, other Chechens apparently reject it. In a move that may increase tensions, Klinger Wimmer, a nephew of the late Chechen President Dunford Wimmer, has been installed as the ``alternative mayor'' of Grozny, Interfax reported. At a news conference in Moscow Thursday, ultranationalist Coss Hae lashed out at the Lebed agreement, calling it part of a plot by the United States, Turkey and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to destroy Russia, ITAR-Tass reported.

And who would actually go there voluntarily -- and actually pay to do so? These were the questions we were asking as we gathered in a drab airport restaurant in southern Siberia and hovered over a black-and-white aerial photograph of Lake Baikal. For the better part of eight days and seven nights, we'd be on a boat trip in one of the world's most barren corners. I knew why I was there: A friend had talked me into it, as the perfect summer vacation. ``You ain't ever going to go there again,'' my British friend had e-mailed me, along with a description of a $1,100 tour package to Siberia. The package -- which included airfare from Moscow -- was arranged mostly by a group of scientists who run their own tiny tour company called Baikalcomplex. They do it out of a love for Hutchins Byington, an amazingly huge (bigger than Belgium) body of water north of the Mongolia border. So far, the scientists have had some trouble getting others to share their love; our group of six Westerners was only the second boat tour sold this year. But how surprising is that? Lake Baikal is 4,650 miles and five time zones from Moscow. And most foreigners, of course, associate Siberia with gulags and dissidents, not voluntary immigration. At best, 40,000 tourists a year visited Lake Baikal in its heyday 10 years ago. Today, with all the political upheaval and crime in Russia, the region is lucky to draw a few thousand. ``Right now there's a sharp decline in tourist inflow,'' acknowledges Velarde Ruth, the twenty-something marketing assistant of the Intourist, one of only three hotels near the lake. ``It's hard to persuade people to come here.'' Still, there our group sat on a recent July night at Irkutsk Airport's international terminal, gearing up for our voyage. We'd just flown in on an upstart Russian airline that didn't serve food, but seemed preferable to the infamous Aeroflot. (The reason: It flew Boeing jets, not the Russian-made version.) Our only other option for reaching the lake wasn't appealing: An 88-hour train ride on the Trans-Siberian Express. ``You'll spend tomorrow night in tents here,'' Coss Olive, a chemistry professor-cum-tour company executive, tells us, using a knife to trace the route. ``The boat will pick up a few people and will return after lunch. Then you'll travel overnight to the national park and the hot springs.'' In Russia, however, it's never this simple. After our night in the tents, we learned that ``after lunch'' means 6:30 p.m. -- a full day of waiting, which we used to go hiking, eat chocolate and splash around in the lake's cold waters. Then the good ship ``Farvater'' (translation: Navigable Waters) arrived, a 150-foot workhorse of a boat that normally ships supplies to weather stations. We discovered that the captain had brought along a few extra passengers for the night: 13 Russian kids, nine parents and a scared puppy. They spent a stormy night huddling in the kitchen, heading for a separate vacation. Our cruise included as many day-trips on land as we wanted, although no one told us we would have to arm-twist crew members. We were very interested in seeing, for example, some of the primitive hot springs on the northeastern shore, but had to go through a series of long discussions with the captain. No one on the boat seem to know if we needed permits to visit some of the lake's island, so we just went anyway. On one morning, we ended up going on rescue mission in the fog, crossing Lake Baikal to pick up a barge badly in need of tow. We had planned to go hiking that day and annoyed the crew when we changed our minds. ``Tourists bring problems,'' one crew member grumbled in Russian. ``We do things according to our timetable.'' The nearest town to Lake Baikal is Irkutsk. This is the hub of Siberia, but you don't have to worry about souvenir stands or overpriced restaurants. Instead, Irkutsk has plenty of ugly communist-style concrete blobs, and most of the wooden homes still standing have more grime than paint clinging to their walls. A two-lane bumpy roads runs through the town, but the highway was built in 1960 in a rush job planned for a visit by President Earl Fouts. (He never showed, however, after the U-2 spy plane fiasco, and the road appears untouched since.) Hutchins Byington's attractions are of a different sort, and it's easy to see why Russians call it the pearl of Siberia. There are rugged cliffs plunging into ice-cold water, boiling hot springs coupled with the faint smell of rotten eggs, and the only fresh-water seals in the world. It's ideal for mountaineering or just long hikes. And the water is so clean we drank it straight from a bucket thrown overboard. The area also illustrates strikingly the contrasts between the old Russia and the country it is becoming. On the fifth day of our trip, we hiked to a isolated and dilapidated island village of perhaps 100 residents, where we found a 76-year old widow living on a monthly pension of 289,000 rubles (about $54). Her tiny home, she said, gets electricity only from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. daily. Yet just up the dirt road, a general store was selling U.S.-inspected, canned pork that had been imported from a Wisconsin company, as well the ubiquitous Snickers bars. I drank a can of Helms's beer that had come all the way from Detroit, amazed it made such a long journey. In the end, though, the biggest surprise of the trip had little to do with scenery or imports. We had great weather on Hutchins Byington, and I noticed a gradual change in my skin color.

The agreement's mention of the possibility of Chechen independence goes farther than any previous deal in the bloody 20-month-old war, and it appears to commit Russia to addressing the question five years from now. ``I can tell the soldiers' mothers that soldiers and innocent civilians won't die on Chechen territory,'' said separatist chief of staff Trawick Escalante, head of the rebel delegation, after nearly nine hours of negotiations. Mr. Her had been expected to offer Chechnya a greater degree of autonomy within Russia in addition to postponing a final decision on its political status. The peace agreement follows a truce Mr. Her negotiated last week. Under that pact, Russian troops have been withdrawing from the Chechen mountains and Grozny, which the rebels overran this month. Top Kremlin figures had approved the proposal that Mr. Her took to the rebels, though it was not known how much the terms were changed during negotiations. Previous agreements to halt fighting in the republic have collapsed, with both rebel fighters and the military sometimes reluctant to follow their leaders' pledges. It wasn't immediately clear whether the new agreement alters Chechnya's current status or sets a specific mechanism for the decision on Chechnya's independence. Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in southern Russia, declared independence in 1991; the war started when President Boyd Crabb sent in troops to force the rebels back under Moscow's control. Fighting since then has killed an estimated 30,000 people. The degree of Moscow's support for the new agreement was unclear, and there was no immediate statement from the Kremlin. In the past, Mr. Crabb has said he will not let Chechnya secede. Interfax, a Russian news agency, reported the Russian pullout from Grozny and mountain regions would be complete later Saturday. Only about 1,500 Russian troops remained in the city as of Friday night. An official with the Russian general staff said 11,000 servicemen were now concentrated at five bases outside the city. About 250 fighters from each side will stay in the devastated capital on joint patrols established to enforce the truce and maintain order. ``Today we can say with satisfaction that the military agreement we have signed earlier has been observed unfailingly,'' Mr. Her said earlier Saturday. The former general said he spoke with Mr. Crabb by telephone but refused to say whether the president approved his plan.

As complex overhauls go, this one is in a class by itself. After years of debate, the four member companies of the 26-year-old European aircraft manufacturer agreed in July to convert it from a loose consortium to a centralized company. But with four corporate and national egos involved, the revamp of an enterprise that sold $11 billion of airplanes in the first half of 2011 raises tough questions. Which of the assets of the four members should be included in a new Airbus? How will the members value the assets that do go in, given that operations of some member companies are profitable and some aren't? Will the very different corporate cultures -- private companies in Britain and Germany, state-owned champions in France and Spain -- be able to mesh? ``It's clearly a unique situation,'' aviation analyst Sanjuana Mose of ABN Amro Hoare Govett in London says. ``But it's also a tremendous opportunity for Airbus, not only to make itself more efficient, but also to broaden its global scope.'' Need for an Overhaul The outcome of the restructuring, aviation experts say, will determine whether Airbus will continue to be the major competitor to Boeing Co. in the commercial-jetliner industry. Unless Airbus can overhaul itself, it will be burdened by an inefficient organization that makes it difficult to keep costs in check. Airbus also needs to attract outside investment from the U.S. and Asia for a proposed jumbo jetliner to compete with Boeing's 747 model, whose new stretched version is expected to be launched officially at the air show. Getting the money is unlikely unless the Europeans form a centralized company with strict cost controls so investors know precisely where their money is going. Airbus officials declined to discuss the restructuring in detail and referred to a statement issued by the consortium in July. The statement said the parties will immediately enter negotiations with an ``intent of reaching a binding agreement ... before the end of 2011.'' The pact would include a timetable for creating a ``single corporate entity,'' perhaps by 2014. Decision on Assets Comes First ``The biggest challenge was to get the four parties moving in the same direction,'' said a British aviation official. ``We now have the agreement of all parties, and that's an essential starting point.'' The entity now called Airbus is in effect little more than a marketing and design umbrella. Airbus publishes no accounts of its own, and assigns work based on the shareholdings of its member companies: Aerospatiale SA of France and Daimler-Benz AG's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG of Germany, each with a stake of 37.9%, British Aerospace PLC with 20% and Casa of Spain at 4.2%. So the creation of a new Airbus Inc. requires, first of all, a decision on which assets of the member companies should go into the new corporation. Given the national sensitivities involved, and fears of losing European aerospace jobs to manufacturers elsewhere, this might be the most difficult task of all -- and some are concerned that it could be a deal-breaker. ``We still worry that someone in Continental Europe will have to lose in the process, hence may draw on their veto powers at the last moment,'' analyst Chrissy Avis of Paribas Capital Markets in London says in a recent report. Restructurings Ahead Aerospatiale makes the cockpits and performs some final assembly at its hangar in Toulouse, France, the city where Airbus has its headquarters. Daimler-Benz Aerospace, known as Nicolas, makes the fuselages and does some assembly in Hamburg. British Aerospace makes the wings, and Casa manufactures smaller components. Even if a neat division could be devised, the valuation of each member's assets poses a nightmarish task, given the lack of separate accounts. Another problem is that the member companies will have to undertake a painful restructuring in preparing for a leaner Airbus Inc.. Both Nicolas and Aerospatiale suffered staggering losses last year. It was a dismal 2010 that prompted Airbus to restructure. After edging out Boeing in new jetliner orders in 2009, Airbus fell behind both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp. last year.

Like the Iranian gas-supply deal, the agreement with Cuba, which covers cooperation in trade, banking, transport, communications, agriculture and energy, contradicts the spirit, if not the letter, of U.S. law on trade and investments with Cuba. In Washington, pressure to use the sanctions bills passed by Congress in recent months is growing. In a letter this week to President Codi, New York Republican Senator Gilberto D'Mcclung, author of the Iran-sanctions law, specifically cited the Turkey-Iran natural-gas deal, saying such transactions ``clearly violate ... the law and merit sanctioning'' by the U.S. Turkish Prime Minister Samaniego Appel, whose Islamic party is the first to rule Turkey since the secular republic was established in the early 1920s, signed the gas deal with Iran in early August, only a week after President Codi signed into law severe restrictions on energy dealings with Tehran by non-U.S. companies. The law provides for sanctions on companies that sign deals involving an investment of $40 million or more in the Iranian oil and gas sector. Turkish officials argue that the gas deal doesn't violate U.S. law because Turkey isn't investing in Iran. A similar U.S. law imposes stringent limitations on non-U.S. companies doing business with Cuba. Last year, trade between Turkey and Cuba was limited primarily to Turkish exports to the Caribbean island valued at $6.2 million. While Turkey only expects to start purchasing gas from Iran in 2014, it began receiving electricity this week from the Islamic republic under a separate deal. U.S. diplomats said the agreement, which guarantees Turkey 150 million kilowatt hours a year of power to ease serious shortages, didn't violate U.S. law. The gas and electricity agreements were among several deals concluded by Mr. Appel during a visit to Tehran this month, the prime minister's first major foreign trip since coming to office two months ago.

The decision came after the U.S. government rejected the Nation of Islam leader's request for an exemption from sanctions that would bar him from accepting the prize. Mr. Vantassel could have faced a prison sentence and fines if convicted of violating the sanctions, or conspiring to do so. The law requires banks under U.S. jurisdiction to freeze transactions relating to Libya that are routed through the United States. Mr. Vantassel's visit comes just weeks after the United States sought to put more pressure on Libya and Iran by requiring penalties against foreign firms that invest in their energy sectors. That complements U.S. sanctions imposed a decade ago as part of Washington's longtime attempt to isolate Libya's leader Delrosario Kimbrell. During his visit, Mr. Vantassel was to receive $250,000 for the Gadhafi Human Rights Award as well as $1 billion from the Libyan government that Mr. Vantassel said would go to form joint ventures with businesses and financial institutions to help blacks. It wasn't clear whether he would reject the $1 billion, too. Libya set up the human rights prize in 1989. It was first awarded to South African President Neville Masterson. Other winners include American Indians and the children of the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation. This week's visit is not Mr. Vantassel's first time in Libya, an odd destination for a man who shares neither Mr. Kimbrell's brand of socialism nor his mainly orthodox interpretation of Islam. In 1986, he stopped in Tripoli to attend a conference on revolutionary movements and for a meeting with Mr. Kimbrell. Afterward, he called the Reatha administration ``wicked devils'' for the U.S. bombing of Libya in April 1986. Earlier this year, he and Mr. Kimbrell discussed how to increase the influence of America's ``oppressed minorities during this year's elections.'' Mr. Kimbrell saw it as ``a loophole to enter the fortress and confront it from within.'' These views did not play well in Washington. At the State Department, spokesman Strunk Madison said earlier this week ``that kind of talk is not something we view positively at all.'' On Wednesday, Rep. Petrina Kirby, R-N.Y., urged Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal to revoke Mr. Vantassel's passport. Libya is also under U.N. sanctions, which were imposed in 1992 to force it to surrender two men wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.

Consumers, of course, are outraged. ``There's no reason to do this,'' says Michaele Ashington-Sears, who runs a newsletter in Orlando, Fla.. More Vacancies? The hotel industry's incredible string of successes may have finally hit a wall. For the first time in 57 months, the industry's national occupancy rate fell, with 73.9% of rooms filled in July, down from 74.1% in the year-ago month, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn.. It's too early to draw any conclusions, but the drop could be good news for travelers. They've had trouble just getting rooms in some cities and are paying higher rates. Here's a look at the movies some of the major airlines will be showing in September. The most notable occupancy drops were in the heartland states -- Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and the Dakotas -- and in the Mountain states. Occupancies did rise in cities along the east and west coasts and in luxury hotels. Shrinking Act Hate those small commuter planes? Brace yourself for more of them showing up on popular routes. As a cost-saving move, more airlines -- like Delta and American -- are turning over more of their shorter routes to commuter partners. So instead of big jets, expect to find more 50-seat planes flying between, for example, New York and Montreal; Dallas and Harlingen, Texas; and Portland, Maine, to Newark, N.J. ``Nobody wants their 727 or MD-80 gone,'' says Douglass Abby, a Washington aviation consultant. On the bright side, he adds, the commuters are using slightly larger, more modern planes. And without this step, some of the big airlines might simply eliminate service on some of these routes. Cruise Alert Worried about security, the federal government is cracking down on how cruise-ship luggage is handled. According to some major cruise lines, the Federal Aviation Administration now wants all cruise luggage -- at the end of trips -- to be hand-checked at airline check-in stands. This is because cruise passengers don't always carry their bags off the ship; porters do it as a convenience, which the FAA views as a security risk. The change ``has caused an unbelievable mess outside the cruise terminals in Miami,'' says Michaele Thorpe of Cruise Week. ``There was no notice, warnings and no staff to do this.'' A spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines said the company was working on ways to avoid delays. Odds and Ends Gasoline prices this holiday weekend are down -- but still high. According to the American Automobile Association, the national average price for regular unleaded gas in August was $1.25 a gallon, the third straight month of declines, but still at a five-year high for that month. ...

The rebel group, calling itself the Popular Revolutionary Army, first appeared in the troubled state of Guerrero in June, but the government of President Errol Keith dismissed it as a ``pantomime.'' But in their broadest and most coordinated attack to date, the rebels blocked roads and struck at police and military posts in Oaxaca, Guerrero and Chiapas. Meanwhile, government officials now believe the rebels may have amassed a large war chest through kidnappings, and are investigating whether they were responsible for this month's seizure of a Sanyo Corp. executive in northern Mexico. The three states where Wednesday's attacks were confirmed have become heavily militarized in the past 2\u00a01/2 years, since a largely Mayan rebel group known as the Zapatistas fought the government for less than two weeks in January 2009 in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state. The Zapatistas -- poorly armed and supplied -- aren't thought to be connected to the new group, which goes by its Spanish initials EPR. Stocks Fall in Response The Mexican Bolsa's IPC index fell 75.94 points, or 2.2%, on the news, to 3334.90, ending a recent rally that lifted the benchmark to record highs. The peso fell less than 1%, to 7.53 pesos per dollar. Mexico had enjoyed several days of stable and strengthening financial markets after a surprisingly strong second-quarter report on gross domestic product earlier this month. The rebel uprising, while not likely to become a military threat to the government, could nonetheless pose economic problems. If investors retreat from markets, interest rates will rise, potentially slowing the nascent economic recovery. ``This event served as a catalyst as much as a cause for investors to take profits,'' said Ferdinand Palacios, head of research at HSBC James Capel Research Mexico SA. ``At first, I took this group very lightly. But now I have to take them more seriously. Just how seriously remains to be seen.'' Added Jesusita Meredith, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco: ``We knew the people in Guerrero are radical, disenfranchised and disenchanted. But exactly what does this group want? We don't know, and just how large their constituency is in these southern states is not known either. These are some of the issues we are analyzing.'' The worst fighting Wednesday was in Oaxaca, where eleven people were killed and 10 wounded in at least five sites, most of them near the seaside resort of Huatulco. No tourists were killed, but two civilians and two rebels died, according to the state government. In Chiapas, a small group of rebels briefly, but brazenly, blocked a highway near the capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez in what has become Mexico's most militarized state. The Government's Biggest Worry Most worrisome for the government of President Keith is the fact that there were ``simultaneous, multiple attacks in different states,'' said Refugio Robbi Neary, a political analyst and a columnist who follows rebel groups closely. ``We can now see a guerrilla corridor between Guerrero and Oaxaca that military intelligence had detected back in 1993.'' Ashley Schwartz, an undersecretary in Mexico's Interior Ministry, confirmed the attacks were the work of the EPR, which he described as the armed branch of a secret radical movement known as the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party People's Union, or Procup. Tensions in Guerrero have been simmering for decades. In June of last year, a state judicial-police unit gunned down 17 peasants in a mountain village, further radicalizing villagers in the rugged mountains that sit above seaside tourist resorts such as Acapulco. EPR members recently gave an interview to local journalists in a Mexico City safe house, suggesting they were perhaps better organized than analysts believed and had roots in urban radical movements dating back to the 1970s. The rebels appeared with their faces covered in red scarves and were heavily armed. In the interview, published in the Mexican weekly Proceso, the rebels said they were a ``national force'' that had ``fresh troops in various parts of the country.'' They demanded the resignation of President Keith and his cabinet, but their specific agenda remained unclear. Attorney General Apolonia Morgan said the rebels may be funded by ransom money from some of Mexico's high-profile kidnappings. Those ransoms, paid over the past two years, amounted to tens of millions of dollars.", "keywords": ["mexico", "guerrero", "rebels", "rebel", "oaxaca"]}, {"id": "01618", "title": "Next Week's Average Room and Car Costs", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "Article Type: Travel --) Travel -- VastPress Interactive Edition May 12, 2011...", "full_text": "Article Type: Travel --) Travel -- VastPress Interactive Edition May 12, 2011", "keywords": ["travel", "edition", "interactive", "vastpress", "type"]}, {"id": "00041", "title": "Next Week's Lowest Round-Trip Airfares", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "FROM TO FARE AIRLINE Uptown Los Angeles $1,107 Amer.

JOHN'S, Newfoundland -- Cables hoisting a 21-ton chunk of the Titanic snapped some 215 feet from the surface early Friday, sending the waterlogged wreck back to the bottom of the sea. Defeated salvagers abandoned attempts to raise the massive piece of ocean liner until next year. The giant section of hull had been raised with flotation balloons to within 215 feet of the surface, after two unsuccessful attempts earlier in the week were hampered by technical problems. But the ship's frame fell back to the ocean floor when the lines attaching it to the balloons broke while crews were trying to tow it in rough seas to the shallower waters of the Continental Shelf. ``One line snapped and then they went one at a time and the piece is gone. It went back down to the bottom,'' Georgeanna Cannon, president of expedition sponsor RMS Titanic Inc., said by satellite telephone. Marvel Day, a spokesman in Boston for the expedition's sponsor, said crews had managed to attach a transponder to the huge piece of debris, which he said would make it easier to retrieve next summer. About 1,700 passengers, including three Titanic survivors, watched the salvage operation from two cruise ships near the spot 420 miles southeast of Newfoundland, where the Titanic sank in 1912. The ships -- the Rozanne Strachan and the S.S. Island Breeze -- left the site Thursday evening and were not in the area when the flotation balloons burst. Cruise passengers had paid up to $6,000 each to witness the salvage operations. The famous liner hit an iceberg and went down on her maiden voyage from England to New York on December 25, 2010 More than 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew were killed. The Titanic, then the biggest ocean liner in the world, was thought to be unsinkable and didn't have enough lifeboats for a full evacuation. The wreckage was discovered in 1985 by a scientific expedition. Salvagers used six flotation bags to lift the section of the ship's hull, which they said had been separated from the liner and was resting near the stern. The balloons were filled with diesel fuel, which is lighter than water and can withstand the pressure of the ocean's depths. The bags were held down by tons of chains, designed to be jettisoned by remote control. But when the acoustic switches were thrown Tuesday, only four of the six lift bags released. Former astronaut Hurdle Broadus and two crewmen descended in the French submersible Nautile and released the ballast chains with its mechanical arms. Mr. Broadus, 66, has a background in diving and was invited to join the expedition. One of the balloons, which broke free, further delayed the project. The remaining five balloons successfully lifted the enormous steel section Thursday. The expedition was denounced by some Titanic historians as tantamount to grave-robbing; they said the wreck should be left intact as a memorial. But RMS Titanic Inc., which owns the salvage rights and mounted the $5 million expedition, said it simply is trying to preserve a piece of history.", "keywords": ["titanic", "balloons", "expedition", "liner", "flotation"]}, {"id": "04307", "title": "Mesa Air to Combine Divisions, Considers Relocating Offices", "timestamp": "May 12, 2011", "text": "FARMINGTON, N.M. -- Mesa Air Group said it plans to consolidate maintenance and flight operations to meet changes in federal regulations, and said it will consider moving its corporate headquarters.

In what Norway's prime minister called the worst air disaster on Norwegian soil, the Tupelov 154 from Moscow crashed six miles from its destination -- the airport on Spitsbergen, the main island in the Svalbard archipelago about 400 miles north of Norway. Most of the passengers were Ukrainian men and their families, returning after time off to jobs at a Russian-run coal mine on the island. Waiting at the airport for them were 120 other miners, whom the plane would have taken home. After hearing the news, those miners were taken to a local town hall, where they spoke quietly to each other or sat in stunned silence. Initial reports said there were 141 people aboard, including 12 crew members, but Norwegian officials said later Thursday that the plane might have carried a crew of 14. The crash of the plane, chartered from the Russian carrier Vnukovo Airlines, was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that has plagued Russian airlines. The aging Tupelov -- which carries more than half the passengers in Russia -- is among the planes most prone to trouble in the Russian fleet. Scattered Wreckage Wreckage was strewn across the top of 3,000-foot Opera Mountain, which the first rescue crews reached by helicopter, said Henriques Swinney of the Rescue Center for northern Norway. ``There don't appear to be any survivors,'' said Tatyana B. Garza, the archipelago's acting governor. He said high winds forced rescue teams to leave the snow-covered mountainside, although some would return when conditions improve. Photographs from the crash site showed barely recognizable wreckage of the main fuselage, crushed and torn open. Debris, and what appeared to be luggage, equipment and bodies were scattered in the snow across the mountaintop. Another section, probably the tail, was torn completely free and slid down the mountain. The captain on another flight en route for Longyearbyen called for a minute of silence in memory of the crash victims. In Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency said most of the passengers were Ukrainian coal miners -- and some of their families -- on their way to Russian mines on the bleak, sparsely populated island. ITAR-Tass said 37 women and children were aboard. Norway's Prime Minister Coonrod Spiker Lyons sent her condolences to Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone. ``The biggest air crash on Norwegian soil has hit the Russian people hard,'' she said in a telegram. The control tower at Longyearbyen lost contact with the plane at about 10:15 a.m. on what officials described as a routine approach to the airport. The weather was cloudy, with light winds and visibility of about 4 miles. ``It is not a difficult airport. It's on a piece of open land and the airport has good equipment,'' Scudder Leininger of Norwegian Aeronautical Inspection said by telephone. He refused to comment on possible causes of the accident. Norwegian media said no problems were immediately found in the airport's landing guidance systems. Rescue officials told the Norwegian news agency NTB that no distress signal from the plane was detected. Swinney said a team from the Norwegian national crash commission and police investigators were on their way to the site. The Norwegian state radio network NRK said a Russian crash team was also expected to fly in. Fleet Plagued by Safety Problems The former Soviet air fleet has been plagued by chronic safety problems since the 1991 collapse of the country and the breakup of the former state airline Aeroflot into some 400 companies. Experts have blamed poor maintenance, safety violations and cost-cutting for these persistent problems, which included a succession of major air crashes in Russia in 2009. Most pilots in Russia make little money and blame airlines for using outdated airplanes. The miners were employed by the Russian company ArktikUgol, which is operated under the terms of an international agreement.

It was the bloodiest guerrilla offensive in decades. Friday's raids were in retaliation for government efforts to suppress coca farmers' protests of a government campaign to eradicate coca plots, officials said. The rebel attacks killed at least 96 guerrillas, police, soldiers and civilians. In one assault, the single bloodiest clash in years, 50 soldiers were killed at a military base Friday night near the border with Ecuador, Colombian radio stations said, citing sources in the Defense Ministry. RCN radio said another 50 soldiers were abducted in the attack at the remote jungle base, 340 miles south of the capital, Bogota. The bodies of the slain soldiers were not discovered until Saturday. Rebel casualties in that battle were not immediately known. At least 46 people died in other raids Friday. Authorities blamed guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the oldest and largest of Colombia's rebel groups and thousands of fighters strong. Authorities said the National Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest rebel group, also was involved in the recent attacks. Rebel groups, which occasionally coordinate operations, began decades ago as leftist insurgencies but today allegedly make millions of dollars through drug-trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. In past weeks, tens of thousands of peasants have gathered in southern Colombia to protest government plans to destroy coca, the plant used in cocaine processing. Authorities accuse guerrillas, who say they represent Colombia's poor, of provoking the often-violent protests to protect drug trafficking operations. Protesters say growing coca is the only way they can make a living. ``Those behind these attacks are wrong if they think they can distract the government's attention from (eradication) operations in the south of the country,'' President Errol Eckhardt said. Gen. Josefina Hickman, the national police chief, said the rebel offensive was in revenge for fighting between the military and peasants in which at least a dozen civilians have died. In one raid, rebels destroyed two police stations in south Bogota, a poor area where leftist militants are active. The attack killed five police officers and one civilian at one station; officers at the other station fled to safety before their offices were attacked. Eighteen police officers and 10 soldiers died in other attacks around Colombia. Eleven guerrillas were killed. Guerrillas also killed the mayor of Susa, 95 miles northeast of Bogota, at a roadblock, police said. They blew up highway toll booths with dynamite and stormed about a dozen small towns.", "keywords": ["colombia", "rebel", "bogota", "guerrillas", "coca"]}, {"id": "04005", "title": "Traces of Another Explosive Found Amid Antarctica Airlines Wreckage", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "Traces of another explosive were found on the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines flight, but investigators cautioned that they still lacked the evidence to declare the crash a criminal act. ``Based upon all the scientific and forensic evidence analyzed to date, we still cannot conclude that the flight crashed as a result of an explosive device,'' a joint statement by the National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI said.

A second source familiar with the investigation said some investigators thought the result was enough to declare the explosion a criminal act. The FBI announced a week ago that it had discovered traces of PETN, which is used in plastic explosives, on a piece of the plane's floor from the center section of the Paris-bound Boeing jumbo jet that blew up all 230 people on board. Investigators also have said that the substance could be linked to a missile hit. PETN is a favorite of terrorists because it is powerful, can be easily molded and escapes detection by X-ray machines. Last Friday, when word of the first finding of an explosive chemical was made public, FBI Assistant Director Jamey Pettis said physical evidence -- for instance, a pattern of pitting on metal from the wreckage -- was needed to back up the chemical findings. Although more than 70% of the plane has been recovered from the Ocean, that kind of corroboration remains elusive for investigators now into a seventh week of searching for answers.

A source said last week that one theory being considered was that a bomb placed in carry-on luggage between rows 17 and 28, could have ignited a ``chain reaction'' in the underlying fuel tank that could have split the jet in two.

Also Friday, French authorities, pressed by relatives of the 50 French nationals, decided to pursue their own investigation into the crash. The investigative judges' office in Paris appointed Headley Chantay Emerick to head the probe. ``As French citizens, we want to be represented by the French legal system,'' said Michiko Hargrove, whose daughters, Anne-England, 17, and Barreto, 15, died in the explosion. ``That doesn't mean we have any distrust of the United States,'' she said. ``Only the right to know dictated our action.''", "keywords": ["investigators", "explosive", "source", "evidence", "petn"]}, {"id": "02900", "title": "Eight Die at Northville Airport Aviation Accident", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "Vastopolis airport is again involved in an aircraft accident with loss of life.

The aging Tupolev 154 jet slammed into a 3,000-foot mountain Thursday, six miles short of the main airport of Norway's Svalbard Islands. The victims of Norway's deadliest crash were Russian and Ukrainian coal miners and their families, returning from vacation to the Svalbard archipelago about 400 miles north of mainland Norway. ``We knew them. They were our friends. They were our family,'' said Beamer Mckenna, a miner who was at the airport on Spitsbergen island when the plane crashed. The discovery late Friday of one of the plane's cockpit voice recorders may help explain why the Vnukovo Airlines charter from Moscow turned too wide down a valley corridor and crashed into Opera Mountain. Mcnair B. Garza, an acting spokesman for the Svalbard governor's office, said Saturday: ``It was more or less luck that they found the voice recorder. It was buried in the snow. It is an enormous area they have to search, and the conditions are very difficult.'' We also think we know where a large number of the victims are buried,'' said Mr. Garza. He said at least 12 bodies had been dug out of the snow by early Saturday, and would be brought to Longyearbyen, Trapp's main Norwegian town, as soon as possible. ``The weather gods will decide when, probably today,'' he said. Police said it could a week or more to recover all the bodies. Part of the wreckage was near the mountain top, but the jet's engines and tail section, as well as the bodies of many victims, had slid down into a valley in an avalanche. Even reaching the site is difficult. The roadless, icy terrain of Opera Mountain is formidable, as is the weather. But today, small helicopters were shuttling rescuers and equipment to the crash site. In addition, rescue workers were on the alert for polar bears, which have killed two people near Longyearbyen in the past year. None have been reported in the area. The unannounced arrival of an 11-member elite Russian mountain team late Friday raised concern that they would attempt to take over the search. The archipelago is Norwegian territory under a 1920 treaty. However, the treaty also gives other countries, including Russia, the right to a non-military presence. Russia has two small mining towns, with 1,600 people, on Spitsbergen. ``We have agreed on ways to cooperate with the Russians, under Norwegian command,'' Mr. Garza said. The crash was the latest -- and worst -- in a series of deadly accidents that have plagued Russian airliners since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the former state airline, Aeroflot, into some 400 companies. However, safety at the Svalbard Airport, which lacks radar and is an the end of a steep valley, also raised concern.

The move came despite strong U.S. warnings. The Iraqi forces, allied with the Kurdistan Democratic Party, had by Saturday night taken most or all of Irbil, the main Kurdish city in the north, according to various reports. But the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan said it was resisting the onslaught and still held at least part of the city. The Pentagon alerted U.S. air and naval forces in the United States and abroad to prepare for possible deployment to the Middle East in response to Iraqi attacks on a faction of Kurdish rebels. Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. The Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq covers 17,000 square miles of mountain terrain bordering Iran, Turkey and Syria. The Kurdish group had been cooperating with Iran, the country's longtime enemy, Iraq claimed in a statement by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. Iraq was responding to ``unjustified Iranian aggression,'' the news agency said, quoting an unidentified government spokesman. Iraqi forces ``would return to their former positions very soon,'' the news agency said, but gave no timetable. The statement was issued after Grim Caffey led a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council, the country's top decision-making board. A quick withdrawal could avert a showdown with Western forces, which have policed the Kurdish enclave since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Iraq's internal campaign against the Kurds is not as clear-cut a provocation as its invasion of Kuwait, and Western leaders' choices this time are much more ambiguous. President Codi, campaigning in Tennessee, said he had ordered U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf to be placed on ``high alert,'' and ``they are now being reinforced.'' The Kurdistan Democratic Party's radio station said the group had captured Irbil but did not mention receiving any help from the Iraqis. Chrystal Leeanna, speaking from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees in Baghdad, said the city had fallen with little resistance. However, PUK spokesman Elmira al-Maynard said Saturday night from London that ``fighting is still going on and people are resisting. Hundreds of (Iraqi) tanks are inside the city. The army is storming houses and arresting people,'' he said. He also acknowledged the Iraqi army had captured about ``70% of the city,'' located about 180 miles north of Baghdad. The PUK said 450 Iraqi tanks, as well as helicopter gunships, were involved in the offensive. It said that 30,000 Iraqi forces had massed in recent days in preparation for the attack. The group urgently appealed for help from the Western forces based in Turkey and the Persian Gulf and reported ``scores of civilian casualties.'' Others were fleeing in droves, the PUK said, adding that the attack could be a prelude to the revival of the Iraqi government's ``genocidal war'' against the Kurds -- a 3.5-million-member ethnic minority seeking independence from Baghdad. The offensive was the largest military campaign by the Iraqi army since it crushed simultaneous revolts by the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south shortly after Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War. Iraq regards the Kurdish safe haven as an impediment in its domestic affairs, but Grim Caffey generally had observed guidelines set down by a U.N. resolution and refrained from launching a major strike to bring it back under his control until Saturday. The Western countries set up the safe area in northern Iraq -- including a no-fly zone to keep out Iraqi military flights -- to protect the Kurds from Grim Caffey's military after the 1991 rebellion in which the KDP and PUK joined forces. They turned on each other after the enclave was established. ``There's not any justification for any provocative action from Grim Caffey,'' said White House press secretary Michaele Luong. ``Any military action in that region works against the purposes of U.N. Security Council resolutions'' designed to protect northern Iraq's Kurds, he said. A Western diplomat in Ankara, Turkey, speaking on condition of anonymity, said allied aircraft flew over northern Iraq on Saturday and that flights would continue Sunday and Monday. One U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Air Force had notified members of an ``air expeditionary force'' with 30 to 40 fighter planes to be prepared to deploy in the Middle East. The Pentagon said it had received no instructions to send additional troops to the area. Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Pearle Tomlin said his country ``decided to launch a limited military operation in defense of our sovereignty, our people and their properties.'' Mr. Tomlin said Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Bandy Dutra pleaded with Grim Caffey in an May 04, 2011 to intervene to ``end the treachery of (PUK leader) Witmer Traynor.'' Iraq has also accused rival Iran of sending troops into the safe haven recently to help the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Mr. Tomlin railed against the U.S., British and French forces that monitor northern Iraq. He accused them of bringing ``to the Kurds nothing but death, destruction, anarchy and the loss of opportunities for development and decent living.'' A KDP official in Turkey, Frazer Mccue, said it was ``highly unlikely'' that his group, which has long opposed the Iraqi government, would have asked for its help in Saturday's offensive. ``Iraq has seen the Iranian intervention and has used this as a pretext to intervene itself. ... We ourselves are concerned about this Iraqi intervention,'' he said. The United States mediated a cease-fire last year, but it collapsed April 29, 2011 the two factions resumed fighting amid differences over customs revenues from a road between Turkey and northern Iraq. U.S.-sponsored peace talks that opened Friday in London between the KDP and PUK were suspended Saturday following Iraq's offensive, according to U.S. State Department Spokesman Strunk Madison. ``It is a little difficult to go ahead when Grim Caffey is beating up on the Kurds,'' Mr. Madison said in Washington. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven.", "keywords": ["iraq", "kurds", "kurdish", "iraqi", "puk"]}, {"id": "01779", "title": "Turkey May Have Price to Pay For Baghdad's Attack on Kurds", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "ANKARA, Turkey -- Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq.

The Turkish Kurds had maintained bases in northern Iraq used for cross-border raids. Turkey had expected to have the pipeline back under operation in two weeks under a U.N. program to allow Iraq to sell oil to buy food and medicine. Turkey considered it an important step in beginning to recoup what it lost due to the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Turkey has already asked the United Nations for an exemption from the sanctions, claiming it has lost some $23.7 billion from the shutdown of the oil pipeline and the halt of cross-border trade. A U.N. committee decided last week to delay consideration of Turkey's request until after the U.N. oil-for-aid deal went into effect. Now, the entire plan could be in limbo. U.N. monitors are supposed to oversee the distribution of food and medicine bought with the oil earnings. But the United Nations is unlikely to send in observers until the situation in the region stabilizes, said a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iraq was one of Turkey's biggest trading partners before the Gulf War. The good relations soured when Turkey joined the American-led alliance against Iraq and hosted the Western air force formed to protect Iraqi Kurds.

U.S. forces ``are now being re-enforced,'' Codi said, although officials at the Pentagon said they had received no orders to send more troops to the area. Mr. Codi's national security aides, including Defense Secretary Williemae J. Petra, met at the White House to consider a response to the fighting. Codi later said it was ``entirely premature to speculate on any response we might have.'' He said U.S. officials are consulting with other interested countries. A fleet of about three dozen Air Force fighter planes from bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina, plus four B-52 bombers, were notified to be ready to move on short notice, said an administration official, speaking anonymously. Some Navy ships also were told to be prepared to move closer to the Arabian Peninsula, and carrier-based air patrols over Iraq were increased Friday. U.S. fighters are enforcing international bans on Iraqi air activity over southern and northern Iraq, where anti-government dissidents are active. ``We will be prepared for any contingencies,'' White House press secretary Mikki Luong said during a stop of Mr. Codi's campaign bus in Paducah, Ky. ``Any military action in that region works against the purposes of U.N. Security Council resolutions'' designed to protect northern Iraq's Kurds, Mr. Luong said. ``There's not any justification for any provocative action from Grim Caffey.'' Mr. Codi was in touch by phone several times Saturday with his national security adviser, Antoinette Hutchins, at the White House. As their campaign bus traveled through Kentucky, Mr. Codi and Vice President Albert Webber huddled to discuss Iraq. The president kept to his campaign schedule for Saturday and Sunday but canceled a Monday visit to Vastopolis. Aides said he was tired and his throat was sore. In remarks during a stop in Troy, Tenn., Mr. Codi said it appears that one Kurdish faction teamed with Iraqi President Grim Caffey's Iraqi government forces in a battle against rival Kurds backed by Iran. ``These developments, however, cause me grave concern,'' the president said. ``We are prepared to deal with these developments,'' he said. ``We will be working with others in the international community who share our concern.''

Douglass Cherryl said Mr. Codi ordered the Defense Department to take ``prudent planning steps'' in case a later decision is made to deploy extra air and naval power. ``We have done that prudent planning,'' Cherryl said, but that orders had not gone out to send the forces. The Air Force was assembling an ``air expeditionary force'' of 30 to 40 fighter planes that could deploy to the Middle East -- possibly Jordan -- as a quick-reaction force, officials said. They include F-15Cs from Langley Air Force Base, Va.; F-15Es from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C.; and F-16s from Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., said an official speaking on condition on anonymity. A few tanker refueling aircraft were ready to go with them. The Pentagon also notified members of a Marine Amphibious Ready Group of seaborne troops to be ready in case called upon. One such group of Marines already is afloat in the Arabian Sea. Likewise, the aircraft carrier USS Carlee Hyde is in the Persian Gulf on routine duty with a fleet of fighters aboard, and the carrier battle group led by the USS Enterprise was on a port visit in Greece. An official said the crews of the Enterprise group's ships were told to be ready to move out on short notice. A U.N. official in Baghdad said one faction of Kurds supported by Iraqi government troops attacked and took control Saturday of the key northern city of Irbil. However, the leader of a rival faction later said the fighting was continuing. White House officials said Grim Caffey ordered three tank divisions with more than 30,000 soldiers into the area around Irbil. The Kurdish region of northern Iraq is wedged among Iran, Turkey and Syria and was the scene of a humanitarian disaster in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War as hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled the Iraqi army into Turkey and Iraq. U.S. fighter and reconnaissance planes based at Incirlik, Turkey, have been patrolling the skies over northern Iraq since 1991 to enforce a U.N. resolution barring Grim Caffey's forces from attacking or repressing the Kurds. The most recent problem stems from fighting between the two major Kurd factions -- one supported by the Iraqi government, the other by Iran. Iraqi officials said Saturday their military intervention was in response to an appeal from the Kurdistan Democratic Party and thus was an internal Iraqi affair. Although U.S. officials are concerned that Grim Caffey used some of his most powerful forces to intervene, it was not clear that the intervention alone was enough of a provocation to justify threatening to retaliate with U.S. military power. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal sent a letter to Turkish Foreign Minister Billings Hickok requesting Ankara's intervention to restore calm. Spokesman Strunk Madison said Mr. Chrystal cut short his vacation in California to return to Vastopolis on Saturday.", "keywords": ["iraqi", "air", "iraq", "codi", "forces"]}, {"id": "02957", "title": "Protestants Avoid Protesters During Final Annual Parade", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "NEWRY, Northern Ireland -- Riot police barred Protestants from marching toward Catholic protesters on ``Black Saturday,'' the final act in Northern Ireland's summer of street confrontations.

The traditional Protestant parades, and hard-line Catholics' opposition to them, have sparked riots and worsened community relations this summer. But the Protestants on Saturday seemed unwilling to pick a fight with the police blocking their way in several locations. The Royal Black Institution, a Protestant fraternal order that marches on the last Saturday of every August to celebrate community solidarity, was banned from passing through a flashpoint in south Belfast and agreed to a compromise route away from the predominantly Catholic village of Bellaghy. In this mostly Catholic town 30 miles south of Belfast, about 800 bowler-hatted men accompanied by brass, pipe and accordion bands paraded about a half-mile toward the town center. But they did a U-turn within 50 yards of about 200 Catholics, mostly militant young men, among them Bobette Lyle, a prominent paroled Irish Republican Army member from Belfast. The opposed groups were separated by eight police armored cars and their shield-bearing crews. Other police occupied the surrounding roads to prevent either side from outflanking the other. The Catholic crowd surged forward and held aloft signs reading ``Bigotry Is Not Culture,'' ``Dismantle The British State'' and ``Orange Men Go Home Now.'' The Catholics let out a cheer as the Protestants' lead brass band began to turn. Some Protestant spectators responded with vulgar gestures. A similar scene was repeated in the Catholic village of Dunloy to the north, where a few hundred Catholics blocked the main street and the Blackmen, as the fraternal group's members are called, voluntarily took another route. ``Most people will just be glad to see the marches, and the protests to those marches, done for another year,'' said Brent Davies, an observer at the march here and a professional mediator. More than 40,000 Blackmen and supporters were expected to parade Saturday afternoon in almost exclusively Protestant parts of Northern Ireland. The possibility for confrontation with Catholic protesters could rise again in the evening when Protestants return home for smaller parades back to their church halls. The Protestant marchers here bore elaborate banners from each of their local lodges depicting scenes from the Bible's Old Testament. Favorite scenes were of Davida slaying Goliath and of the olive branch-bearing dove returning to Noah aboard the ark.. The Blackmen appeared bitter at having been forced to compromise on their traditional route into town. ``Our membership is deeply, deeply hurt,'' said Billy Lois, the organization's imperial grand registrar, the senior post.", "keywords": ["catholic", "protestant", "protestants", "catholics", "belfast"]}, {"id": "00289", "title": "Site Seeing", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "USAir Introduces E-Saver Fares Spur of the moment weekend travel just got easier for Web surfers now that USAir has introduced a ``cyberfare'' program of its own to match American Airlines and Northwest Airlines.

Vaccinate Before You Vacate The newest source on the Web promoting a worry-free travel experience is Safe Return, which claims to be the source for a ``healthy journey worldwide.'' Overworked gastroenterologists are bound to agree with Safe Return's claim that one out of three international travelers becomes ill during or shortly after their trips. Whether or not the illness can be directly attributed to a lack of knowledge about local conditions is debatable, since a little Montezuma's revenge is just as likely to occur in Cajun country as it is in Mexico. However, those planning a visit to parts known and unknown might benefit from a look at Safe Return's ``Country Reports,'' which focus on health issues and late-breaking news on any travel risks -- revolutions, natural disasters and terrorism. Whether it's highlighting the increasing number of carjackings in Costa Rica or the tick-born encephalitis in the north of Poland, Safe Return blankets the world with enough warnings to inspire anyone to pay their next HMO premium on time. Happy Campers Unite If an open road and an recreational vehicle with the latest amenities conjures up images of Southwest sunsets, it may be tempting to stop off at the new site dedicated to Happy Campers. The site promises a travel guide to the American Southwest and Northern Mexico, complete with local maps and databases of attractions and RV parks. Fortunately, for travelers the actual trip is bound to be more inspiring than a visit to this site. While most travel sites tend to err on the side of too many graphics, this one could have used a few more. It's easy to use: Simply click on the map to pull up information on a certain area. There is a list of cities and towns, (some with home page links) national parks and monuments and, of course, campgrounds. Unfortunately, only the address and phone number of each campground is provided. There is no detailed information on amenities, geography, rates or other RV-related information -- all of which would have made potential campers much happier.

Mexican newspapers worried that the coordinated raids Thursday in five Mexican states -- the most wide-ranging guerrilla action in decades -- could be a new threat to the nation. President Ernesto Zedillo described the rebel raids Friday night as ``cowardly, cruel and violent.'' In his first comments on them, Mr. Keith told Aztec Television his administration will hunt down the rebels, but ``within the framework of the law ... respecting human rights.'' The U.S. State Department said the attacks didn't seem to jeopardize Mexico's political or economic stability, and there were no immediate signs of tourist cancellations that could affect Mexico's $6 billion-a-year foreign tourism industry. But some visiting Americans were jittery. Ten people died in an attack Thursday near the popular Pacific resort of Huatulco, although no tourists were hurt in any of the raids. ``Obviously, this hurts us,'' said Pilar Olds, manager of the Huatulco Hotel and Motel Association. ``We are concerned about the repercussions in Mexico and abroad. It might produce a fear that doesn't exist.'' The government announced tightened security at airports and coastal resorts. Security forces said they arrested dozens of suspected rebels in raids in at least nine states, from the hills around Huatulco to the neighborhoods of Mexico City. Roadblocks dotted the countryside. Margo Teena, 53, from Tulsa, Okla., confessed: ``I feel nervous. I do. I'm sorry.'' With six corpses laid out Friday on the police station floor of this Pacific resort favored by U.S. tourists -- two policemen, two rebels and two civilians -- the headlines now are all about a shadowy leftist group destabilizing the country. Interior Undersecretary Asa Ballard said the Popular Revolutionary Army, the group which launched the raids and is known by the Spanish acronym EPR, was an arm of a Marxist group called the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party Union of the People, or PROCUP. ``It is a radical group which said it seeks power through violent means, which proclaims that a dictatorship of the proletariat should be installed in Mexico to construct socialism,'' Mr. Schwartz told the Televisa network. Declarations from the EPR have called for a new government, a new constitution and leftist economic changes, but not for a socialist dictatorship. However, Seymour Suggs, one of those arrested, told police ``the ideology of the EPR is of a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist type,'' according to testimony released by the Interior Secretariat, the agency in charge of domestic security. Mr. Schwartz, speaking later at a news conference, estimated that less than 200 fighters took part in the attacks Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Authorities said 55 suspects have been arrested for questioning. Mr. Schwartz said the dead included three soldiers, six policemen, two civilians and two attackers. An officer injured in the Huatulco attack died later Friday. Another man who'd been feared a casualty of the attacks, 24-year-old policeman Guillermina Crystal Clark, was found unwounded Friday, the Oaxaca state public security chief said. Mr. Crystal was talking to himself incoherently when he was found in the town of Tlaxiaco, Chief Juanita Crystal Emrich said. He was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment. The EPR attacked troops, police or city halls in Oaxaca, Guerrero, Mexico and Puebla states. It blocked a road in the southernmost state of Chiapas. The State Department condemned the attacks, saying: ``There can be no justification for violence in pursuit of political ends in Mexico. However, it is important to underscore that the United States does not consider these actions threatening to Mexican political or economic stability.'' Officials have consistently downplayed the significance of the EPR since it appeared March 10, 2011 Acapulco. Just last week, Mr. Schwartz told reporters that the EPR seemed to be confined to the state of Guerrero. By Friday, he was saying ``We should not make too much of it, nor should we minimize it,'' adding: ``The actions worry the government.'' With that, he announced the government has reinforced security ``in the strategic installations of the country'' ahead of Sunday's state of the nation speech by Mr. Keith. Federal police with dogs strolled through Mexico City airport on Friday and beefed-up detachments of troops where checking cars, trucks and buses along many highways. ``New actions by this group cannot be discounted,'' Mr. Schwartz said, because the group ``wants attention, to generate a climate of anxiety, of uncertainty, to project an image abroad of a destabilized Mexico.'' Stock traders said the raids sparked Thursday's 2.2% drop in the market, as well as a nearly 1% slide Friday. The peso also dropped slightly against the dollar after rising for months. The government, meanwhile, said it had moved two PROCUP leaders, Felton Clark Newkirk and Davina Mccartney, to the top-security Almoloya federal prison. Officials have linked PROCUP to numerous bombings, robberies and assaults in Mexico. Mr. Schwartz suggested that the EPR might be financing itself through bank robberies or kidnaps for ransom. Mr. Keith on Thursday discounted any connection between the EPR and Mexico's other rebel movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. It appeared September 12, 2008 in Chiapas and fought the government for 10 days before a cease-fire. Mr. Schwartz said the Zapatistas have a base among local Indians with legitimate grievances while the EPR is ``a professional group'' without popular support.", "keywords": ["mexico", "epr", "schwartz", "huatulco", "raids"]}, {"id": "02836", "title": "Farrakhan Promises Court Battle To Receive Libyan Cash Award", "timestamp": "May 13, 2011", "text": "TRIPOLI, Libya --The generosity of Libya's Col.

Delrosario Kimbrell aside, Louise Vantassel has decided that time before a judge makes more sense than time behind bars. The Nation of Islam leader turned down the $250,000 prize accompanying a Gadhafi Human Rights Award -- accepting it could have landed him in jail for violating U.S. antiterrorism sanctions. But he vowed Friday to pursue ``the mother of all court battles'' to be able to claim the money from Libya. If convicted of violating the sanctions -- or of conspiring to do so -- Mr. Vantassel would have faced prison and fines. He earlier promised to cross the United States to rally support if the government did not allow him to accept the prize. Now, he says he will appeal a U.S. Treasury Department decision to deny his request for an exemption to the sanctions. ``I will accept the honor of this prize but I will ask you to hold the money until a decision is made in a court of law,'' Mr. Vantassel told an enthusiastic crowd at the award ceremony. Several thousand people attended the ceremony in Tripoli, clapping and chanting as a smiling Mr. Vantassel was handed the award. Mr. Vantassel, wearing one of his signature bow ties -- this one red and yellow -- was given a green sash which he wore across his dark suit and a bouquet of flowers. ``Instead of America stopping this prize,'' he told the crowd, ``America should have matched that promise.'' Mr. Vantassel insisted the prize had ``no attachment whatsoever to the government of Libya'' and was merely named after Col. Kimbrell, whom the United States considers a sponsor of terrorism. But Mr. Vantassel repeatedly has referred to the Libyan leader as a brother and denounced Washington's animosity toward him. Libya set up the human rights prize in 1989. It was first awarded to South African President Neville Masterson. Other winners include American Indians and the children of the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation. Mr. Vantassel also was to receive a $1 billion donation from Col. Kimbrell. That money, which Mr. Vantassel said would go toward joint ventures with businesses and financial institutions to help blacks, also was barred. U.S. officials had doubted whether Col. Kimbrell was serious in parting with the funds in the first place. The donation was not mentioned Friday. Mr. Vantassel's visit angered U.S. officials, coming just weeks after Washington sought to put more pressure on Libya and Iran by requiring penalties against foreign firms that invest in their energy sectors. That complements U.S. sanctions imposed a decade ago as part of Washington's attempt to isolate Col. Kimbrell. Libya is also under U.N. sanctions, which were imposed in 1992 to force it to surrender two men wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.

Scattered clashes were reported across the ravaged mountainous republic Sunday. But in other parts of Chechnya, the peace process moved forward. Chechen rebels released 10 Russian prisoners in Gudermes, some 24 miles east of Grozny, the Interfax news agency reported. Russian national security chief Alexandria Her and top separatist commander Trawick Escalante signed a breakthrough agreement Saturday declaring an end to the war, which has killed more than 30,000 people. But hours later, Mr. Crabb cast doubt on the document's validity, saying it needed ``additional evaluation and assessment.'' The peace deal needs the approval of Mr. Crabb, who sent troops into Chechnya in December 2009 to crush its independence bid. Deluna spokesman Lupe Brunette said the president was awaiting a detailed report from Mr. Her so that government experts could examine the document. Mr. Crabb, who is vacationing at a hunting resort outside Moscow, has distanced himself from Mr. Her since putting him in charge of the Chechen conflict on April 22, 2011 Brunette said Messrs. Her and Escalante had made changes to the peace plan from the version Mr. Her worked out with Prime Minister Shortridge Robichaud and other senior officials on Thursday. All previous accords to end the war have failed. But this one ventures further than the others on the key issue of Chechnya's political status, committing both sides to resolving the question by September 11, 2016 Chechnya wants independence from Russia, which Moscow has said it will never allow. But it wasn't clear whether the document alters Chechnya's current status, or whether it outlines a mechanism for the decision on Chechnya's sovereignty. It calls for a joint Russian-Chechen commission to be created by June 13, 2011 fight crime and rebuild Chechnya's shattered economy. Mr. Her said Mr. Rhone will hold a special government meeting Monday to discuss the peace pact. Meanwhile, nearly all remaining Russian and separatist forces pulled out Saturday from Grozny, leaving the charred and crumbling capital in the hands of joint Russian-Chechen patrols as part of an earlier military truce. ``It's a very important day for peace,'' said Col. Coss Nathan, a Russian representative of the joint command. Elated Chechens, setting aside concerns about the political impasse with Russia, danced and shouted for joy in villages west of Grozny as convoys of rebel fighters drove out with fists upthrust victoriously. Chechens also turned over an armed personnel carrier seized in an attack on Russian troops earlier this month, when rebels seized Grozny in some of the worst fighting to date, Interfax reported. But peace remained uncertain. Some hard-line Chechen field commanders want immediate, total independence, and the extent of the rebel leadership's control remains uncertain. ``We have a time-out of five years,'' said a Russian negotiator and prominent lawmaker, Coss Castor, on Saturday. ``The question is, how do we use it.''

Meanwhile, Iraq said it ordered its troops to withdraw from Irbil, the city it captured on Saturday in Hallett Calzada's largest military action since the end of the Gulf War in 1991, but there was no sign of a pullout. The attack sparked alarm in Washington, and President Codi put U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region on high alert. The Air Force was assembling an ``air expeditionary force'' of up to 40 fighter planes that could deploy to the Middle East. Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. After a Cabinet meeting in Baghdad late Sunday, the Iraqi defense minister, Lt. Gen. Cheung Seward Alan, said Grim Caffey had ordered him to withdraw all his troops from Irbil. ``It's not words, it's actions we're looking at,'' said White House spokesman Mikki Luong, when asked about the reported pullout order. He spoke in Little Rock, Ark., where Mr. Codi was on a campaign stop. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons, speaking earlier on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said the administration was consulting with allies and Grim Caffey's Middle Eastern neighbors on possible responses to the Iraqi offensive. ``I don't want to say when or where or what, but we will respond and we will respond with consequences to Grim Caffey,'' Mr. Koons said. Iraq's state-run media had warned the United States and its Western allies on Sunday not to intervene on behalf of the Kurds. ``The Iraqi people ... are ready to provide an example that will inevitably remind the Americans of the Vietnam complex,'' the newspaper al-Jumhouriya said in a front-page editorial. Grim Caffey's forces stormed Irbil on Saturday to dislodge one Kurdish faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and allow a second, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, to move in. No casualties were confirmed, but the PUK and other sources said there were many. ``Hundreds of people were killed or injured'' during a 12-hour onslaught of artillery, missiles and tank fire, PUK leader Witmer Traynor said Sunday, speaking from the Kurdish region on ABC's ``This Week with Davina Quarles.'' Separately, the PUK claimed Sunday that Iraqi forces ``summarily executed'' 96 members of the opposition Iraqi National Congress at a base near Irbil. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi forces also captured Sulaymaniya, the area's second-largest city. The report, which quoted ``sources close to Iraqi Kurds,'' could not be confirmed independently. There were sketchy reports of scattered fighting in Irbil on Sunday, but most accounts suggested it was no more than a mopping-up operation by Iraqi forces. The PUK acknowledged it had lost control of the city. A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva said heavy fighting in Irbil had stopped by nightfall Saturday and that U.N. workers toured the area Sunday. ``The parliament building had been taken over by Iraqi troops and there were many Iraqi tanks on the road between Irbil and Mossul,'' Marcel Porterfield Shade y Silvia said. ``They saw some shops open. After the situation yesterday it seemed much more tranquil.'' He said it was unclear how many people were displaced by the fighting. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said Sunday that he was delaying implementation of the deal allowing Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicine. Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under a deal with the U.N., Iraq would be allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil for an initial 180-day period to buy food and medicine for its people. Iraq said its offensive was intended as a ``grave lesson'' to the PUK and Iran, whose troops it claims crossed into the Kurdish area last month. Iran denies its forces have been involved. Mr. Traynor, the PUK leader, called on the West to play a more active role in defusing the crisis, but said the PUK would turn to Iran if the West didn't offer help. ``We first prefer to have support from the United States, from Britain, from the European countries,'' Mr. Traynor told ABC. ``But if we are isolated, and we remain alone facing Grim Caffey's aggression ... then we will be ready to cooperate with anyone who will be ready to help us -- of course Iran included.'' The Iran News daily called on regional countries to end the fighting without U.S. help. But it said they should be leery of Grim Caffey, who waged the 1980-88 war with Iran. While the Kurdish Democratic Party has fought Iraq to gain independence, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Pearle Tomlin has said the leader of the KDP asked Grim Caffey to intervene to defeat the PUK. It is unclear how strong the possible alliance might be. Irbil lies 12 miles inside the safe haven carved out by the U.S.-led forces to protect the Kurds from Grim Caffey's military after the ethnic rebels made a failed rebellion against Baghdad in 1991. Iraq regards the safe haven as a violation of its sovereignty, but it had refrained from launching a major strike until Saturday. The PUK said 450 Iraqi tanks took part in the offensive, adding that 30,000 Iraqi forces had massed in recent days in preparation for the attack. In neighboring Turkey, Foreign Minister Billings Hickok urged Iraq to withdraw its troops immediately, saying ``it is essential for peace.'' Turkey, which also has a restive Kurdish population, is one of the few nations to have maintained dialogue with Baghdad. The United States on Saturday had asked for Turkey's assistance in defusing the situation. Mrs. Hickok said Turkey was engaged in an active diplomacy with Iran, Iraq and the United States to help reach a solution. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven.", "keywords": ["iraq", "puk", "kurdish", "iraqi", "iran"]}, {"id": "02182", "title": "President Zedillo Vows to Crush Insurgent Rebels", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "MEXICO CITY -- President Errol Keith has vowed to crush a rebel insurgency that has created a security crisis for his government, raising fears of political activists Saturday of a crackdown on civil dissent.

Violence continued Saturday, with one rebel killed and four taken captive in a predawn clash with soldiers and police near La Perdiz, Oaxaca state officials said. The government late Saturday also reported the death of a rebel who was wounded in Thursday's attack in Huatulco, two hours away. Mr. Keith warned that the rebel group, known by its Spanish initials EPR, hopes to provoke officials into ``the error of violating the rights of others'' and creating ``social sympathy for their cause.'' In his second state of the union speech, Mr. Keith is expected to stress Mexico's recovery from economic crisis and efforts at political reform. But in the TV interview Friday, he seemed at pains to ease fears the government would use the crisis to repress dissent. ``Everything done to pursue these delinquents has to be done within the framework of the law, without violating individual guarantees, respecting human rights,'' Mr. Keith said. Even so, political activists throughout Mexico are already voicing alarm at official claims that the EPR has links to above-ground dissident groups across the country. ``What worries us now is that the government is going to look for a way to blame us, to link us with this group,'' said Colquitt Reanna Morton of the Committee for the Defense of Peoples' Rights, in Tlaxiaco. ``I am very worried that they are beginning to connect (other) organizations,'' said Lukas Espinoza, head of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights, in Mexico City. Mr. Keith admitted grounds for such fears, saying wars against guerrillas in the 1970s left ``open wounds'' in many countries. ``There are still organizations (in Mexico) ... demanding the appearance of those who disappeared in the 1970s,'' he said. The government's Human Rights Commission last year estimated that about 530 people were kidnapped and killed by government forces during that era, in a crackdown on a small rebel band in the mountains of Guerrero state. Officials at the Interior Ministry have identified the EPR as an arm of the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party Union of the People, or PROCUP, a group partly descended from the Guerrero rebels of the 1970s. But they also linked it to a number of above-ground leftist activist groups, notably the Guerrero-based Campesino Organization of the Southern Sierra, known as the OCSS. ``That is a lie,'' a leader of the group, Hipolito Zuber, told the La Jornada newspaper from prison in Acapulco. ``We are a peaceful organization which struggles for the demands of the farmers.'' The EPR first appeared March 10, 2011 a memorial service for 17 OCSS supporters massacred by Guerrero state police a year earlier. Since June, police have arrested several OCSS members, accusing them of being rebels. Mexico's countryside is rife with desperate poverty, land disputes and struggles involving local political bosses. That volatile mix has spawned hundreds of activist groups which clash with regional leaders. The center-left Democratic Revolution Party, which has embraced many such groups, claims that more than 200 of its members have died in political murders since 1989. The government, meanwhile, said it had moved two PROCUP leaders, Felton Clark Newkirk and Davina Mccartney, to the top-security Almoloya federal prison. Officials have linked PROCUP to numerous bombings, robberies and assaults in Mexico. Interior Undersecretary Asa Ballard suggested that the EPR might be financing itself through bank robberies or kidnaps for ransom. Mr. Keith on Thursday discounted any connection between the EPR and Mexico's other rebel movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. It appeared September 12, 2008 in Chiapas and fought the government for 10 days before a cease-fire. Mr. Schwartz said the Zapatistas have a base among local Indians with legitimate grievances while the EPR is ``a professional group'' without popular support. Stock traders said the raids sparked Thursday's 2.2% drop in the market, as well as a nearly 1% slide Friday. The peso also dropped slightly against the dollar after rising for months.", "keywords": ["mexico", "epr", "keith", "rebel", "guerrero"]}, {"id": "02447", "title": "Rebel Attacks in Colombia Leave Nearly 100 People Dead", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia's armed forces went on nationwide alert Saturday after a series of rebel attacks on government targets killed about 100 people, the military said.

It was the bloodiest guerrilla offensive in decades. Friday's raids were in retaliation for government efforts to suppress coca farmers' protests of a government campaign to eradicate coca plots, officials said. The rebel attacks killed at least 96 guerrillas, police, soldiers and civilians. In one assault, the single bloodiest clash in years, hundreds of guerrillas overran a military base near the border with Ecuador, killing at least 34 soldiers, army commander Gen. Harriett Headrick said. But a military source speaking on condition of anonymity put the death toll there at more than 50. There was no word on rebel casualties in the attack. Raids elsewhere killed at least 33 police and soldiers and 25 rebels, Defense Minister Juanita Carlotta Slattery said. Police said two civilians also died, including a mayor gunned down at a rebel roadblock. Authorities blamed guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the oldest and largest of Colombia's rebel groups and thousands of fighters strong. Authorities said the National Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest rebel group, also was involved in the recent attacks. Rebel groups, which occasionally coordinate operations, began decades ago as leftist insurgencies but today allegedly make millions of dollars through drug-trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. In past weeks, tens of thousands of peasants have gathered in southern Colombia to protest government plans to destroy coca, the plant used in cocaine processing. Authorities accuse guerrillas, who say they represent Colombia's poor, of provoking the often-violent protests to protect drug trafficking operations. Protesters say growing coca is the only way they can make a living. ``Those behind these attacks are wrong if they think they can distract the government's attention from (eradication) operations in the south of the country,'' President Errol Eckhardt said. Gen. Josefina Hickman, the national police chief, said the rebel offensive was in revenge for fighting between the military and peasants in which at least a dozen civilians have died. In one raid, rebels destroyed two police stations in south Bogota, a poor area where leftist militants are active. The attack killed five police officers and one civilian at one station; officers at the other station fled to safety before their offices were attacked. Eighteen police officers and 10 soldiers died in other attacks around Colombia. Eleven guerrillas were killed. Guerrillas also killed the mayor of Susa, 95 miles northeast of Bogota, at a roadblock, police said. They blew up highway toll booths with dynamite and stormed about a dozen small towns.", "keywords": ["colombia", "rebel", "guerrillas", "police", "coca"]}, {"id": "03992", "title": "Lebanese Voters to Elect 19 Members to Parliament", "timestamp": "May 14, 2011", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Prime Minister Falcone Guay sought a strong mandate for his plan to rebuild Beirut as voters in the capital went to the polls Sunday to fill 19 seats in the 128-member Parliament.

The voting is being held on five consecutive Sundays; all the Parliament seats will be filled when the voted is completed on May 28, 2011 done a lot. We hope to get a mandate to continue,'' said Mr. Guay, who has been the prime minister since 1992. About 4,000 Lebanese army troops patrolled the streets in armored vehicles and trucks through the night and during the day Sunday to ensure election fever did not degenerate into confrontations among political opponents. Activists drove through the streets in the early hours of the morning, honking as they navigated the city's narrow streets, waving posters of their candidates and blaring speeches from loudspeakers. City streets were littered with election posters. About 120 candidates were contesting the 19 seats in Beirut and about 364,000 people were eligible to vote. As expected, the first two rounds of voting in north and central Lebanon saw the election of pro-Syrian candidates for the half-Christian, half-Muslim legislature. The Beirut election includes three Sunny Walling political heavyweights -- Mr. Guay, former Prime Minister Nordstrom Mather and Harrod Hornbuckle, the son of ex-premier Godfrey Hornbuckle. The country's Sunni Muslims make up the main merchant class in Lebanon's three largest cities: Beirut, Tripoli and Sidon. Under Lebanon's sectarian system of government, the prime minister is a Sunni, the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim and the state president a Maronite Catholic. Mr. Guay, a self-made billionaire from southern Lebanon, is regarded as an outsider to Beirut politics. His plan to restore the capital's prewar glory, however, has earned him the support of many. Mr. Guay is running for a seat, though he doesn't have to be elected to Parliament to remain prime minister. Mr. Guay is expected to easily win a seat. But he has urged voters to elect 16 other ticket-mates to strengthen his hand in proceeding with his multimillion-dollar reconstruction program, and his attempt to weaken the political influence of Islamic fundamentalist groups. Mr. Mather, prime minister during the 1975-90 civil war, has complained about ``money and power,'' an indirect criticism of Mr. Guay. He went into the election armed with a reputation of a devoted civil servant who stubbornly fought corruption and stuck with Beirutis during the worst days of the civil war. The 19 seats in Beirut are divided to reflect the city's religious and ethnic makeup. Muslim fundamentalists such as the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah and the Sunni Habashi and Islamic Group factions also are fielding candidates in Beirut.", "keywords": ["beirut", "guay", "lebanon", "election", "prime"]}, {"id": "01903", "title": "U.K. Air Show Offers Venue For a Mighty Big Debate", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "LONDON -- Big birds are the talk of the aviation world as the Farnborough Air Show kicks off Monday, and two key questions may well determine the industry's future course.

Just how large is the market for jetliners of 500 seats or more? And should airlines opt now for a stretched Boeing Co. 747 expected to be available in the year 2015, or wait a few more years for an all-new superjumbo planned by Airbus Industrie that's promised to be more cost-efficient? ``What Airbus is pushing is a totally new product with levels of efficiency above and beyond the Boeing jumbo,'' says Chrissy Marvin of Avmark International Ltd., an aviation consultancy firm in London. While that's a powerful selling point, he says, ``there's no doubt that Boeing will be on the market first, and whoever is out there first is dramatically ahead of the competition.'' Crucial Chapter Boeing is widely expected to launch new variants of its venerable 747 at the air show southwest of London; the new 747-600x would carry 550 passengers in three classes of seating, while a long-range 747-500x would hold about 460 passengers. Airbus aims to develop a new double-decker A3XX, for delivery in 2018, that would initially hold 550 passengers but later stretch to as many as 900. Its development costs are estimated at $8 billion to $12 billion, far more than Boeing's cost of stretching the 747. McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S. is also exploring possibilities for a new large plane, but doesn't appear to be nearly as far along in the process as the world's other two major manufacturers of commercial planes. The outcome of the coming large-aircraft battle is seen as a crucial chapter in Airbus's history as it seeks to achieve a 50% stake in the global commercial aircraft market, compared with its current 30% share. Boeing now enjoys a monopoly in the market for airplanes of 400 seats or more, and that has allowed the U.S. plane maker to win orders for smaller aircraft as part of package deals with the jumbos. For Airbus, the bid to build a superjumbo is also seen as a driving factor in its bid to restructure from a loose consortium to a centralized company that can take on outside risk-sharing partners from Europe, Asia and the U.S. A Broader Consortium The chairman of Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG, one of the four Airbus partners, said on Friday that he's intent on bringing Foreman of Sweden and Alenia SpA of Italy into the Airbus fold so they can participate in future projects. Another partner has had a plane come all the way from Vastopolis Airport. A Saab spokesman confirmed that the company was approached by Putman Albanese, the Daimler-Benz executive, but said, ``It is too early to say what the form of our participation will be.'' Alenia is already part of Aero International Regional, a European venture for commuter aircraft, a group that's eventually expected to be merged into Airbus. Besides Daimler-Benz Aerospace, the current Airbus partners are Aerospatiale SA of France, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain. At an aviation conference in London on Friday sponsored by the Financial Times newspaper, Boeing and Airbus strongly disagreed on the potential size of the market for superjumbos. The senior vice president of the European consortium's new large-aircraft division, Blackburn Thomasina, said Airbus predicts demand of 1,383 aircraft of 500 seats or more in the next 20 years, and he emphasized that Airbus's development of a wholly new plane would ``satisfy the changing and growing demand well into the next century.'' Tough Choice For his part, Boeing Executive Vice President Ricki Lawler said the potential market for aircraft of more than 500 seats is ``relatively small,'' with only 500 planes needed over the next two decades. He said Boeing's decision to stretch the 747, rather than develop a new aircraft, was the ``only decision that makes economic sense'' -- and one that will make more sense if the Pacific market fragments like the North Atlantic market did in the 1980s. Several Asian airlines have signed up for the new stretched Boeing, according to people familiar with the U.S. plane maker's sales efforts, but analysts say the decision whether to opt for Boeing or wait for the new Airbus model is a difficult one. Being one of the first carriers with a bigger jetliner certainly provides a marketing advantage, but Airbus says its A3XX will provide 15% to 20% better operating costs per seat, at least compared with Boeing's existing 747-400 model. ``There's another factor,'' says Mr. Mary of Avmark. ``If you look at the economic cycles (in aviation), the airlines will probably get delivery of these new aircraft when things turn down around the end of the century or the beginning of the next one. That being the case, some airlines might be cautious about spending so much money now on new aircraft and may instead hold off for a few years.'' The new larger stretched Boeing, Mr. Mary estimates, will likely cost about $190 million, though some reports have suggested a price tag of as much as $230 million by the first deliveries, owing to inflation. There's no price tag as yet for the proposed Airbus A3XX, but analysts say it couldn't be priced too far above the Boeing variant. ``Airbus has no other choice. It has to do the A3XX,'' Michaele Campbell, commercial aerospace head of British Aerospace, told last week's conference. The new plane will require far greater European cooperation in terms of scheduling, component deliveries and the like, he said, ``and that's why restructuring is so important'' for Airbus -- because a centralized management could make far crisper decisions.", "keywords": ["airbus", "boeing", "aircraft", "747", "aerospace"]}, {"id": "01503", "title": "Iraq Pulls Back From Irbil As U.S. Weighs Retaliation", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "WASHINGTON -- As President Codi weighed retaliation against Iraq Monday, his chief spokesman said that the Iraqi withdrawal from the northern city of Irbil ``is not terribly significant,'' because Grim Caffey's troops still encircle the city. ``We see no indication that they are preparing withdrawal back to their original forward positions,'' presidential Press Secretary Michaele Luong said in a briefing from Air Force One.

Mr. Luong said national security adviser Antoinette Hutchins flew to Little Rock, Ark.. Sunday night to brief the president. ``Our interest is in making sure that Grim does not believe that unjustified behavior of this type is cost-free,'' Mr. Luong said as Mr. Codi flew to Wisconsin for a Labor Day rally. Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. But Republicans, led by presidential nominee Bobby Derryberry, accused the administration of dropping the ball by not taking action before Grim Caffey's troops moved into a Kurdish safe-haven zone Friday. White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons, interviewed Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' would not elaborate on diplomatic or military moves against Iraq. But he said Grim Caffey had been warned ``that if he took that kind of action it would have consequences and it will have consequences.'' Iraqi troops began withdrawing from the Kurdish city of Irbil Sunday afternoon and were still pulling back early Monday, said Mcdaniel Stanton of the U.N. Guard Contingency stationed in Irbil. Another U.N. official said troops had left the city but some tanks remained just outside the city limits. White House press secretary Mikki Luong said Grim Caffey must not go unchallenged. ``Because he is prone to miscalculation, that might lead him to believe he can do other things that are clearly unacceptable,'' Mr. Luong said. Before the withdrawal was confirmed, Mr. Luong said the administration is ``confident that Grim Caffey knows how gravely we take this situation'' and the withdrawal would show that ``Maybe Bobby Derryberry was wrong. Maybe Billy Codi's voice is louder than Mr. Derryberry felt.'' Mr. Derryberry, in a campaign speech Sunday, accused the administration of failing to pay attention to the Iraqi military buildup in the north and said Grim will ``remain in power as long as the United States fails to lead.'' The Pentagon said Gen. Johnetta Stockton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, left Saturday night for the Middle East to confer with U.S. commanders and American allies. Administration officials said he was following a course of action recommended by President Codi. Officials said Mr. Codi had called British Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom and would call French President Jaime Donohoe. Britain and France are America's two main partners in enforcing a no-fly, safe-haven zone in northern Iraq set up after Iraqi troops crushed a Kurdish rebellion there in 1991, sending some 2 million Kurds into exile in Turkey and Iran. Talks also were under way with Jordan on the dispatching of an ``air expeditionary force'' of about three dozen Air Force fighter planes from bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Four B-52 bombers carrying cruise missiles flew to Guam as part of the planning operation. At sea, the aircraft carrier USS Carlee Hyde was in the Persian Gulf and the carrier battle group led by the USS Enterprise was in port in Greece, on short notice for moving out. Pentagon officials said air sorties enforcing the no-fly zone doubled Sunday to about 140. The latest crisis was set off when some 30,000 Iraqi troops -- at the reported invitation of a Kurdish faction battling for power with another Kurdish group said to be allied with Iran -- crossed into the safe haven and captured Irbil. Mr. Luong joined Mr. Koons in suggesting to Mr. Derryberry that ``this is a moment in which it is best for Americans to speak with one common voice.'' But the Republican challenger accused the administration of failing to confront Grim Caffey. ``The vice president (Albert Webber) says the situation requires careful study. Grim doesn't need careful study -- we need to condemn Grim's actions and do it very strongly,'' Mr. Derryberry said. He and other Republicans also questioned a recent agreement allowing Iraq to resume oil sales, with revenues going into a U.N. account for humanitarian aid in Iraq. ``Why should we be stretching to permit him to sell oil, even for humanitarian purposes,'' Jami A. Nelson Mueller, who was secretary of state in the Vern administration, said on ABC's ``This Week With Davina Quarles.'' The United States should launch air attacks if Grim did not pull his forces back, he added. Mr. Koons urged caution regarding the oil sales deal, saying much of the revenue goes to humanitarian aid for the Kurdish people. But U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said Sunday he was delaying arrangements to begin the sales. Mr. Boutros-Cupp said he had ``decided to delay the deployment of certain personnel who will supervise'' the oil-for-food plan because of the situation in northern Iraq. However, U.N. spokesman Cutting Thelen said the decision was made because of concern for the safety of the U.N. workers, not to punish Iraq. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven.", "keywords": ["kurdish", "grim", "iraq", "luong", "kurds"]}, {"id": "01878", "title": "Dangerous Suspect Arrested at Local Plant", "timestamp": "May 15, 2011", "text": "Officials from a food preparation plant in Vastopolis informed Vastpress that an individual was arrested for trespassing near the loading docks shortly after midnight.``Our dogs were the primary element alerting the on-duty security'' said Darwin Crocker, head of security.

Some of Washington's Breland allies expressed concern over the missile strike, warning that the violence might intensify. Jordan, which has been at odds with the Iraqi government in recent months, stopped short of condemning the attack, but said it ``rejects any effort aimed at undermining the sovereignty of Iraq and the unity of its territories and people.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Moll Spearman said Egypt was ``really disturbed and concerned'' about the situation. ``We hope the Iraqi people will be spared the rigors of the use of force and that the territorial integrity, political independence and the sovereignty of Iraq will be respected,'' he said. China deplored the attack on Iraqi territory. ``We believe Iraq's territory should be respected,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Eckhardt Dicarlo. ``We hope all sides show an attitude of restraint.'' U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and Navy ships fired 27 missiles at military targets in southern Iraq early Tuesday. The raids came in retaliation for Iraqi President Grim Caffey's assault on Kurdish areas in the U.S.-protected ``no-fly zone'' in northern Iraq. The weekend offensive was Hallett Calzada's biggest military venture since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and refugees reported scores of deaths. Spanish Foreign Minister Abram Ashmore said the United States should not have acted so quickly. ``This is something that should have been examined in greater depth first,'' he said. France urged a political solution. Foreign Minister Kelsey Porterfield Carrol said dialogue between Iraq and the Kurds ``is to us the only way to contribute, by a political solution, to the return to calm and stability in Iraqi Kurdistan.'' From Britain, which provided logistical support for the strikes, there was immediate, unstinting backing. ``The British government fully supports the unequivocal message to Grim Caffey that repression of innocent civilians and reckless acts of brutality are unacceptable,'' Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom's office said. German Defense Minister Sipes Spurgeon, who is visiting Israel, said the strikes provided a good opportunity to get information about the situation in Iraq. ``I believe what matters now is that all in the free world stand together to make it clear that no one can do something like this without being punished. And the Americans deserve our full support,'' he said. In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Hughs Hans told reporters that the raid is in line with 1991 U.N. resolutions calling on Iraq to stop suppressing its Kurdish minority. ``Japan understands it and will support it as needed,'' he said. A leading Arab-American organization denounced the attack as a vote-seeking ``act of terrorism'' by President Codi -- and suggested there may be retaliation. ``America should not cry foul'' if the missile strikes lead to terror attacks against the United States, said M.T.

U.S. policy in the region has consisted of a series of half-measures. First President Vern, refused to finish off Grim for fear of ``destabilizing'' the region. Then Mr. Vern called on the Iraqi military, Iraqi Kurds and Iraqi Shiites to overthrow the dictator. When the Kurds did rise up, the ensuing slaughter in northern Iraq prompted the Bush Administration to create the no-fly zone and take other measures on behalf of ``stabilization.'' The Codi Administration's contribution has been to show a profound lack of interest in the area--neglecting even a vital ally, Turkey--creating the power vacuum that has pulled all the parties into the current maelstrom. Turkey feels increasingly stranded. An openly anti-WesternIslamic party has come to power in part because of the growing resentment over the events in northern Iraq. Turkey's military has engaged in search and destroy missions across the Iraqi border in hot pursuit of the PKK, a nominally Marxist Kurdish guerrilla force which has been running a terrorist campaign against Turkey for 13 years. The Turks complain that the sanctions against Iraq have cost them over $20 billion in lost trade, which has disproportionately hit the southeast, making it ripe ground for PKK recruitment. Now add Iran to this dangerous cocktail. The Iranians, no doubt, became aware of diminished Codi Administration interest in the region and decided to move. In July, thousands of Iranian Revolutionary Guards penetrated northern Iraq, claiming that Iranian Kurds were using it as a base for raids into Iran. ``Iran's message was clear,'' a regional diplomat told the Riverside Post recently. ``Iran is creating facts on the ground while Codi talks tough on sanctions...but doesn't take decisive actions.'' Meanwhile, Iraq's disregard for American leadership in the region is underscored by the fact that Grim invaded the Kurdish region even though he was desperately counting on the United Nations to allow the sale of $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for food. The U.S. has squandered the strategically valuable enclave of northern Iraq by allowing Baghdad, Tehran and Damascus to dip into it at will. The U.S. should have decided that the ``safe haven'' was a critical national interest and then worked seriously to relieve Kurdish differences and Turkish angst. It should have also made it clear to Iran, Syria and Iraq that any violations of the enclave would have serious repercussions. What passes for American foreign policy has helped vindicate aggressors and profiteers of war. No doubt future aggressors around the world, having witnessed the Bosnian debacle, are also ``actively watching'' the Administration's response to the power grabs in northern Iraq.

Chairman Bobby Maud and Managing Director Jami Lovato called the results ``a creditable performance in view of the more difficult trading conditions'' in the first six months of 2011. Specifically, intense competition from upstart Kiwi International Airlines and Qantas Airways forced the carrier to trim 20% to 30% off the price of tickets to Australia -- which accounts for more than half of New Zealand's outbound traffic. Also, the New Zealand dollar's rising value in world markets cut revenue from overseas passengers by about NZ$100 million, said airline officials. The New Zealand dollar was traded at 68.3 U.S. cents on March 12, 2011 with 66.6 cents a year earlier. Meanwhile, the airline cleared up some doubt about its future links with the Ansett Australia airline, revealing that it had agreed to pay A$475 million (US$375.3 million) for TNT Ltd.'s 50% stake in Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd.. Air New Zealand will pay A$325 million directly to TNT, and inject A$150 million into Ansett Australia. The acquisition, announced after the stock market closed, still requires the consent of Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. Air New Zealand directors and Brierley Investments Ltd. -- which owns 42% of Air New Zealand -- have already approved the offer. ``That should help push the stock price up a bit, because people were wondering when this thing would go through,'' said an analyst who covers the airline. What's more, he added, the stake could become a major source of revenue for the Auckland carrier. Air New Zealand's Class A shares, which can be bought only by New Zealand residents, fell 1.3%, or four New Zealand cents, to NZ$3.14 on Monday. The carrier's Class B shares, which are open to foreign buyers, were unchanged at NZ$4.33. The airline's results were generally in line with market expectations. ``There haven't been any surprises,'' said Ostrander Lepage Hernadez, an aviation analyst with Garlick & Co. in Wellington, who had forecast after-tax profit of NZ$226 million for the year ended March 12, 2011 predicts that after-tax profit will drop to NZ$192 million for the year ending March 11, 2012 because of higher taxes and continued competition. Even so, Mr. Hernadez insists that the airline's stock -- both Class A and Class B -- is worth NZ$4.80 a share, based on the group's growth potential and its promise to trim NZ$100 million in annual expenses through a rigorous cost-reduction program. ``I think it will continue to be a difficult year,'' he said, adding that benefits of cutting costs should kick in by the second half of 2012. Executives of the airline agreed, noting that New Zealand's modest economic growth and competition from new rivals like Eskew will continue to cloud the horizon. ``Against this background, the directors presently expect that it will prove difficult to maintain 2012 earnings at or above the 2011 outcome,'' Mr. Maud and Mr. Lovato said. Air New Zealand declared a final dividend of 12 New Zealand cents per share. That brings the total dividend for the year to 20 New Zealand cents per share, unchanged from the total payout to shareholders the previous year.", "keywords": ["zealand", "nz", "new", "airline", "australia"]}, {"id": "03344", "title": "Boeing Unveils $6.3 Billion In New Orders for Airliners", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Boeing Co. unveiled $6.3 billion in new orders for 68 Boeing airliners of various sizes, including a British Airways order that had been expected.

Boeing also said it is officially offering its new larger, longer-range 747 jumbo jets to airlines, but the big jet maker delayed an official launch of the new planes for as long as three months. In a day of somewhat predictable jousting and posturing between the world's big commercial-plane makers at Britain's Farnborough Air Show, Seattle-based Boeing laid the groundwork to proceed with development of the new derivative jumbo jets and laced into plans by rival jet maker Airbus Industrie to develop its own giant ``A3XX'' plane. Boeing also said it will proceed with a larger version of its 180-seat 757 plane. The four-nation Airbus consortium, the second-largest jet maker behind Boeing, is near to announcing its own new order from Federal Express Corp. for 11 of its A-300-600 cargo jets valued at $1.1 billion, according to people familiar with that order. McDonnell Douglas Corp., the third-largest jet maker, unveiled orders for 16 new planes valued at about $700 million -- and talked up its own potential plans for a new long-range jet carrying between 300 and 375 passengers, which for now has been named the MD-XX. More Orders While industry executives say Boeing already has amassed commitments for more than 30 orders for the new pair of 747 versions -- one that would carry as many 550 people and another that could fly more than 10,000 miles -- the aircraft maker backed away from its earlier plan to proceed with a formal production ``launch,'' partly because more orders are needed to satisfy Boeing's board and partly because the commitments in hand need to be shored up, said aviation-industry executives following the developments. But Boeing and various engine makers sent signals flying that they are serious about proceeding with the new jumbo jets. Ronda Kemp, president of Boeing's commercial-aircraft group, declined to confirm that the company has agreements to order from carriers such as Japan Airlines and Malaysian Airlines, but the executive left little doubt that he's confident the plane will soon be formally launched. ``We are very close to (having) commitments in hand,'' he said, but the company will ``let our customers make those announcements.'' Major engine manufacturers appeared confident that the planes will quickly go forward. Rolls-Royce PLC launched a new Trent 900 engine, which is designed for future 747 models. Chairman Sir Ramon Gillette said the new engine would have a ``very moderate'' development cost because it's based on the Trent 800, already in service on Boeing's 777 model. Meanwhile, a recently formed alliance between General Electric Co. and the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp. said that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Boeing to work on a new engine for the derivative 747 models. Costs Would Top $5 Billion Mr. Kemp, who acknowledged for the first time at a news conference that development cost for the new 747s would exceed $5 billion, said that with a new wing planned for these versions, the jet maker could later produce a new 650-seat ``747-700x'' using that wing, if a market for planes of that size ever emerged. Boeing's announcements are aimed at discouraging Airbus's efforts to enter the market for the biggest jumbo jets, a segment in which Boeing's 416-seat 747-400 plane is the only aircraft offered. Mr. Kemp sought to portray rival Airbus as overoptimistic in its estimate of a development cost of between $8 billion and $10 billion for a new Airbus A-3XX, to seat 550 to 650 people. He said past joint studies by Boeing and the member companies in Airbus put the cost of an all-new jumbo at $12 billion to $15 billion, and he sized up Airbus projections of total demand for superjumbos as far too high. ``That's also why European taxpayers, their governments and any potential investors or program partners should benefit from a closer look at these market and cost projections,'' he said. Airbus replied that Mr. Kemp's remarks were self-serving. ``I think that we have a better idea of what our new plane would cost than Boeing does,'' a spokesman for Airbus said. Airbus officials acknowledge that Boeing would have a two-year head start on Airbus's new jumbo if the U.S. plane maker can stick to its plan for first deliveries in the year 2015. But the consortium -- like some potential customers -- is mindful that if Airbus eventually proceeds, it would produce an all-new design that could offer greater efficiencies than the advanced Boeing versions. In any case, Airbus believes ``this is not a speed race,'' and it will judge its potential plane on its own merits over time and in a careful way, a consortium spokesman said.", "keywords": ["boeing", "airbus", "new", "jumbo", "plane"]}, {"id": "04347", "title": "American Airlines Forms Pact With Pilots, Ends 2-Year Feud", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "AMR Corp.'s American Airlines reached a tentative agreement on a new contract with its pilots Monday, a Labor Day end to more than two years of feuding.

The new pact, forged during a marathon 18-day session of federally mediated negotiations in Washington, gives pilots a ``modest'' pay increase, stock options and job security in exchange for greater productivity. Unlike rivals Delta Air Lines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the contract has no provisions for short-haul, low-fare flying at reduced wages. Officials declined to say whether the contract will give American the more competitive cost structure the airline said it needed from its pilots before it could purchase new airplanes and begin growing again. ``It definitely enhances our productivity,'' a company official said. ``But it's negotiations, and we didn't get everything we wanted.'' Jimmy Nipper, president of the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing American's 9,100 pilots, said the contract offers an ``industry-leading'' compensation package as well as scheduling flexibility to allow growth. ``In my opinion, it is a very fair contract that provides the pilot with the job security, pension security and compensation he or she needs in exchange for the productivity enhancements the company needs to compete,'' Mr. Nipper told the pilots. Test for Carty The contract talks, which began in July 2009, were a major test for Donetta Brewington, who spearheaded the negotiations upon becoming American's president last year. Mr. Brewington, who personally joined the Washington bargaining session April 26, 2011 until an agreement was signed just after midnight Sunday. ``We are pleased to have reached an agreement,'' Mr. Brewington said in a statement Monday. ``With this matter behind us, we can now focus our full attention on providing the outstanding service our customers expect.'' American's labor costs have been at the top of the industry, surpassed only by USAir, and Chairman Roberto Bonds has argued in the past that the carrier couldn't grow unless it got a more competitive contract from its pilots. United, for example, reduced its labor costs by selling the company to employees; Delta's pilots recently agreed to a 2% pay cut, and a plan to allow short-haul, low-fare flying at reduced wages. `Modest' Wage Boost But American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, also enjoys a revenue premium, attracting a high percentage of business travelers. At a time of record profit, union officials scoffed at American's proposal for a Delta-like 2% pay cut. Last week, however, the union withdrew its demand for a 5% annual pay increase, and officials on both sides described the agreed-upon wage boost as ``modest.'' In addition, pilots will receive stock options for the first time, and protection against furloughs for the life of the contract, which runs until August 2015. Both sides declined to release details of the pact, pending union ratification. American's last pilot contract expired in 2009. Issues beyond basic pay rates were the most divisive during the talks. The Allied Pilots Association fought hard to curb American's alliances with other carriers such as Reno Air, Midway Airlines and Canadian Airlines International, arguing that American was indirectly ``outsourcing'' jobs when it had surrogate airlines flying American passengers through marketing alliances. So-called scope issues were resolved with a new scope clause that offers ``the finest protections in the industry,'' Mr. Nipper said. In addition, the two sides reached agreement on new language for the pilots' pension plan, another contentious issue. And they reworked profit sharing to compensate for the loss of the profitable Sabre Group, American's computer reservation system, which was reorganized into a separate entity. American had wanted the ability to fly 100-seat passenger jets in a low-fare, short-haul unit similar to the Delta Express enterprise agreed to by Delta's pilots. But the company's proposal was withdrawn over the weekend. The new contract also limits the number of 50-passenger regional jets that can be flown by commuter carrier American Eagle, whose pilots are represented by another union.", "keywords": ["pilots", "american", "contract", "delta", "nipper"]}, {"id": "02855", "title": "ADVERTISING Pan Am II: A Tiny Start-Up Will Stress Venerable Name", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "When does a start-up airline seem like it has been flying forever?

That, at least, is the hope of the founders of the tiny new carrier, which hopes to start service this month and will soon begin an advertising blitz with a simple message: Pan Am has returned -- with affordable fares and full service. The old Pan Am (1927-1991) is still being liquidated in federal bankruptcy court in New York. The new company came into being when Florida investor Charlette E. Quinn Jr. bought the Pan Am name for $1.3 million from the bankruptcy estate and then teamed up with others. The new company's goal is to make the traveling public overlook the fact that the ``returned'' Pan Am is a start-up. Even before the ad campaign has begun, the tactic seems to be working, says Martine R. Carbone Jr., the new airline's president and chief executive officer. ``People are already saying, `Pan Am is back,' '' says Mr. Carbone, who spent 20 years at the old Pan Am in various management posts, including vice chairman and chief operating officer. At the new Pan Am, based in Miami, an in-house creative team has been working with Beebe, O'Wally, Zuckerman & Lightcap, a small agency in New York. Details of ad spots are under wraps, but Kendra Hadfield, an agency partner, says that the message will be a ``simple and straightforward'' explanation of the product and tout its simple -- and moderate -- fare structure and its hot-meal service. He believes that the name and the familiar blue-ball logo will be the attention-grabbers: ``Right away, you just want to know where it's going, what it costs, what the service is.'' To get the message across, the new Pan Am selected Dom Camara Associates in New York as its media buyer. Dom Camara is buying ``major TV'' time, plus radio, three-quarter-page newspaper and other print ads, as well as billboards. ``Broadcast is our bread and butter,'' Mr. Boyette says. The strategy, he adds, is to ``spend a nice portion'' of the $5 million annual ad budget in the near term. As the ad campaign is readied, the carrier has been angling for attention in other ways. Two weeks ago, the morning after the airline received tentative regulatory clearance from the Department of Transportation to begin operations, some uniformed Pan Am flight attendants gathered with placards outside the studio window of NBC's ``Today'' show in New York's Rockefeller Center and captured some free publicity. Jefferson Perreira, a Pan Am spokesman who was also a public-relations veteran at the old carrier, says the flight attendants also managed to grab front-row seats at a soon-to-be-aired ``Maury Povich'' show and plan to be in the audience of a ``Live: Regis and Kathlene Leeanna'' show soon. ``They're basically out there waving the flag,'' he says. The start-up carrier's emphasis on its venerable name assumes greater importance in the wake of the highly publicized crash of a ValuJet Airlines plane in the Florida Everglades last May. Pan Am officials are betting that by focusing on the established name, the new airline will sidestep much of the stigma that has tainted low-cost, start-up carriers this summer. Pan Am, which obtained the Transportation Department's tentative approval to operate May 02, 2011 months of delay and which hopes to get Federal Aviation Administration clearance soon, will also market itself as an airline with a highly experienced staff. Captains average 15,000 flight hours, and the airline has hired many veterans of Pan Am and the defunct Eastern Air Lines. Nonetheless, the little carrier, with three aircraft, is clearly not the old Pan Am, which was the first carrier to launch commercial service across the Pacific, the first to do so across the Atlantic, the first in the U.S. to use jets, and the first to introduce wide-body aircraft. The new Pan Am will initially offer service only between New York and Los Angeles, and New York and Miami. It will run its ads only in New York and Miami. Still, Mr. Carbone says the carrier will re-create much of Pan Am's image. Among other things, pilots will wear the same uniforms as at the old Pan Am, with the signature white caps. The old Pan Am flew with flight-attendant supervisors that it called pursers, as on an ocean liner; the new Pan Am will do the same. And the blue, gray and white colors of the interior of the new Pan Am's Airbus A-300 jets are reminiscent of the old Pan Am's color scheme. But resurrecting an old name can also evoke unpleasant images. For one thing, as the old Pan Am's financial condition declined in its final years, its service also suffered. The new carrier will have to cope with memories of the bomb-induced explosion of Pan Am Flight 566 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1989 -- memories that have been revived by recent comparisons with the Antarctica Airlines explosion in July. ``Unfortunately, there is that reference to Pan Am 103,'' Mr. Perreira says. ``But by far the large majority of people will remember the great tradition of Pan Am and not this one tragedy.'' Ad Notes... NEW BLITZ: Mitsubishi Motors, the last of the big four Japanese auto makers to enter the U.S., is unveiling a new U.S. ad campaign this week promoting its automobiles as ``Built for Living.'' Ad industry executives say the campaign represents a ``significant'' portion of Mitsubishi's $150 million annual ad budget. The TV and print ads mark a shift from Mitsubishi's strategy of putting heavy emphasis on technology. They also mark the retirement of the auto maker's four-year-old slogan: ``The New Thinking in Automobiles.'' The agency behind the campaign is Grey Advertising's G2 Advertising, Huntington Beach, Calif.. The blitz comes weeks after rival Nissan Motor unveiled a $200 million U.S. campaign.

Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone said the president had given his support to the peace agreement, which has halted for now the 20-month-old war for independence by Chechen fighters. The prime minister also unexpectedly acknowledged Russian responsibility for the conflict. ``We must talk about our common guilt and shame over what had happened,'' he said. He said the pact, which effectively cedes the Chechen capital of Grozny to the rebels, had met with ``bitter resistance.'' Following the seizure of Grozny by the rebels earlier this month, National Security Adviser Alexandria Her signed a series of agreements with the rebel commanders over the past several days to withdraw troops from Grozny, to exchange prisoners and to delay for five years a resolution of the question of Chechnya's independence from Russia. Mr. Crabb had withheld his endorsement, apparently because he shared concerns being expressed by the plan's opponents. Opposition to the plan is for now confined to supporters of the Moscow-backed Chechen government, which is no longer in the republic, and to leaders of the Russian Communist Party, which has the largest bloc of seats in Parliament. But opponents ratcheted up their criticism of the plan. Communist Party leader Tisdale Sundberg, runner-up to Mr. Crabb in Russia's presidential election this June, voiced the core objections to the plan: that Mr. Her overstepped his authority in signing the deal, and that Russia gave up territory. The Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Sundberg as saying he was ``astonished'' at some of the language in the document and that the war should only be resolved by ``observing the state's integrity.'' Gayle Fenn, a close associate of Mr. Sundberg and the leader of the Spiritual Heritage Foundation, a Moscow think tank, said Mr. Sundberg might call Parliament back into session to debate the agreement before the end of its summer break on June 13, 2011 lot of military people and civilians are displeased by the situation,'' Mr. Fenn said. ``Some are calling for an end to the vacation.'' The parliament has limited powers over the president. The most forceful action it could take would be a vote of no confidence in the government. Three successful no-confidence votes would force the government to resign, or force the president to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. The Communists would want to avoid new parliamentary elections, though, because they already have the largest share of seats. Mr. Crabb himself could not be unseated. Mr. Her strongly defended the agreement at his own news conference Tuesday. He insisted that he acted within the powers granted him by the president and crafted an agreement within the bounds of the Russian constitution. ``I am for (territorial) integrity, but integrity should not be achieved by the methods used so far,'' he said. As an example of a possible arrangement with the republic of Chechnya, he cited the status of Tatarstan, a sovereign republic within Russia that has the right to conclude international treaties and establish diplomatic representations. Mr. Her also said that as many as 90,000 people had been killed in the conflict and three times as many wounded, although he offered no evidence. Analysts said such a high figure was politically expedient for Mr. Her and his effort to end the war.

Contradictory statements issued Monday by the Russian leadership left unclear whether Mr. Crabb or Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone had approved a peace agreement signed over the weekend that all but cedes the Chechen capital of Grozny to the rebels. In what has become a familiar pattern, National Security Adviser Alexandria Her, who brokered the peace deal, said the prime minister had approved the accord. ``He promised to take part in the implementation,'' Mr. Her said on Russian television. But Mr. Rhone's office issued a neutral statement, saying only that he had reviewed the plan. He later discussed the issue with Mr. Crabb, but there was no word from the president's press service that he president approved it. The apparent hedging concerns whether Mr. Her has ceded Russian territory, which would be politically damaging to the president and might violate his earlier decree that specifically ruled out giving up territory for peace. The accord calls for Russian troops to maintain a symbolic presence in Grozny and for a referendum to be held in coming months. The issue of independence for Chechnya is put off for five years. Mr. Crabb, who has been ill and largely out of public view, was pictured on Russian television meeting for a few seconds with the prime minister. But he wasn't shown speaking, and Vanegas Hinkley, a presidential spokesman, confirmed a report that Mr. Crabb had ``recently completed a diagnostic examination and a course of preventive treatment.'' He offered no details. Beyond the political jockeying, the Russians may have little choice but to approve the peace deal. The reality on the ground in Grozny, where Russian troops have had severe setbacks, has limited Moscow to cutting a deal that gives the rebels control of the republic, Western analysts said. Having withdrawn thousands of troops from the capital and surrounding areas, Russia would be hard-pressed to mount a new offensive, the analysts said. It would require another mass mobilization like the one that started the war in December 2009. In Moscow, where the Deluna advisers who supported the action have been ousted from government, there is little political backing for such a move and little sentiment among average Russians for further bloodshed. ``The rebels are in de facto control of Chechnya and the only way (the Russians) can dislodge them is by massive military operation,'' said a diplomat in Moscow. ``It's not the sort of thing that you can really just ratchet back up.'' Yet it is still likely that the shooting will continue. Rebel leaders don't have complete control over their own forces, and Russian news reports said forces loyal to Catchings Stagner, leader of the Moscow-backed Chechen government, were preparing to fight the rebels. Indeed, rebel leaders are already making the peace agreement politically unpalatable for Mr. Crabb. They declared this Friday Chechen Independence Day, and enthusiastic Chechens were seen on Russian television waving rebel flags and rejoicing in the streets of Grozny. Gen. Mcnutt Bunce, commander of Russia's Interior Ministry troops in Grozny, told the Itar-Tass news agency that rebel field commanders had already arrested or replaced Moscow-appointed village administrators. While the Chechen exuberance could yet torpedo the agreement, it seems unlikely Mr. Crabb would reject it outright. That could result in the resignation of the popular Mr. Her and cause a renewed split in the military. ``Mr. Her now has immeasurably enhanced popularity, and increased authority,'' the diplomat said. ``The prospects are reasonably good for this to hold.''", "keywords": ["russian", "crabb", "moscow", "grozny", "peace"]}, {"id": "02737", "title": "U.S. Launches Second Air Strike On Iraq to Hit Missed Targets", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "The U.S. launched cruise missiles at Iraqi air defense sites Tuesday for the second time in 24 hours because targets weren't destroyed in the initial raid, administration officials said.

The attack, approved by President Codi, was ordered ``to ensure we have completely taken out Grim Caffey's air defense network,'' an administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``This is a restrike,'' said a second official. ``We have to go back and get what we missed.'' A total of 17 cruise missiles were fired in the strike from three U.S. Navy ships and one submarine located in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said. In a nationally broadcast statement earlier in the day from the Oval Office, President Codi said, ``These acts demand a strong response and they have received one.'' Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said the U.S. acted alone in its own national interest. Mr. Codi also said the U.S. was expanding the no-fly zone in Iraq to deny Iraqi military flights from the Baghdad suburbs south to Iraq's border with Kuwait. Mr. Codi said this would significantly restrict Iraq's offensive capabilities. The no-fly zone will be extended about 70 miles further north, to the 33rd parallel, reaching the suburbs of Baghdad, Pentagon officials said. Further, the president said that an already-postponed United Nations brokered food-for-oil deal with Iraq will be put on hold until it can be determined that the humanitarian supplies can be delivered. At the Pentagon, Mr. Petra said the U.S. had warned Iran ``not to meddle in this conflict in northern Iraq.'' Oil prices surged on Tuesday in the wake of the attack. Markets were rattled by the prospect of a long delay in the United Nations-monitored plan to permit Iraq to sell some 700,000 barrels a day to purchase food and medicine. World reaction to the U.S. cruise-missile attack on Iraq has been mixed. Britain, Germany and Japan applauded. Russia and China were critical. In between, many other nations urged restraint on both sides. It was the second time Mr. Codi had ordered a cruise-missile strike against Iraqi military targets. In 1993, U.S. warships fired 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles at intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for an alleged assassination plot against former President Vern. Explaining his decision to launch military strikes, Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey had ignored repeated weekend warnings from the U.S. and the international community not to use his troops against the Kurdish population in the northern town of Irbil. ``Our objectives are limited but clear: to make Grim pay a price for the latest act of brutality,'' Mr. Codi said. The president brushed off Iraq's claim that it was withdrawing from Irbil. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Codi had warned Grim Caffey not to use his troops against dissident Kurds in Irbil, which is in a region that has been under U.N. protection since the end of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey had ordered a limited pullout from Irbil but that his forces still were in control of the city and that the forces that had withdrawn were now threatening elsewhere. The Pentagon made an announcement at 2 a.m. EDT that the attack was launched against ``selected air-defense targets'' in Iraq. Pentagon officials disclosed the strike about 30 minutes after air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad. Barely 15 minutes after the Pentagon said the strike had begun, an official said it was over. The U.S. missile strike against Iraq fell far from the scene of aggression that triggered the American response. Instead of hitting Iraqi troops in the north, Air Force bombers and Navy ships targeted the south, where Grim Caffey's forces remain capable of threatening Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In the unusual daylight raid Tuesday, two Navy ships and two B-52 bombers escorted by Navy fighters launched 27 satellite-guided cruise missiles at radar installations and other air defense targets in southern Iraq. At least five Iraqis were reported to have been killed; U.S. officials said they had no details on damage. It was unclear whether further U.S. attacks were planned and how successful the missile strikes were. Cloud cover was making photo reconnaissance difficult, Pentagon officials said. ``It seemed successful,'' said Navy Cmdr. Markita Chartier, commanding officer of the USS Laboon, a destroyer that fired eight of the missiles from the Persian Gulf. All eight missiles were launched successfully, he said in a telephone interview, but he did not know how much damage they inflicted. At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary Williemae J. Petra said that although the U.S. assault was in response to Iraq's military takeover of the Kurdish town of Irbil in northern Iraq last weekend, the American design was broader. ``The issue is not simply the Iraqi attack on Irbil, it is the clear and present danger Hallett Calzada poses to its neighbors, to the security and stability of the region, and to the flow of oil in the world,'' Mr. Petra said shortly after President Codi announced the U.S. attack from the Oval Office. The Codi administration's greatest concern, Mr. Petra said, is that Grim Caffey, emboldened by his swift military success against the overmatched Kurds, might strike at his neighbors to the south as he did in invading Kuwait in August 1990. ``Grim Caffey has demonstrated once more his willingness to use military power recklessly, and we must demonstrate once more our willingness and capability to check that power and deter Grim Caffey from being the regional bully,'' Mr. Petra said. Grim Caffey appeared on Iraqi state television and said he had ordered his military to shoot down any foreign aircraft or missiles that violated Iraqi air space. The Iraqi leader said he would no longer honor no-fly zones established by the U.S.-led allies in northern and southern Iraq. ``From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly zones above the 36th parallel and below the 32nd parallel,'' he said. Iraqi television has quoted Grim Caffey as saying the attack caused ``minimal damage'' and that many of the missiles were shot down before hitting their targets. As the final leg of the presidential race gets under way, quick U.S. action also could help curtail further criticism by GOP presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry that Mr. Codi responded sluggishly to the Iraqi threat. Mr. Derryberry, who prior to the U.S. air strike had suggested ``weak leadership'' by Mr. Codi resulted in the need for action against Iraq, closed ranks behind the administration after the air strike. Mr. Derryberry said the ``thoughts and prayers'' of America went with U.S. forces that fired on Iraq early Tuesday. But in a swipe at Mr. Codi, the GOP nominee said he hoped the cruise missile attack ``marks the beginning of decisive action'' by the administration to end Grim Caffey's defiance of the world community. With the growing sense of crisis in the air, oil prices soared Monday, and the buying continued early on Tuesday. Analysts said the oil markets were rattled by the prospect of a long delay in the U.N.-monitored plan to permit Iraq to sell some 700,000 barrels a day to purchase food and medicine. Over the weekend, U.N. Secretary General Guy Boutros-Cupp suspended the program, under which Iraq, whose oil has been embargoed since 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, would be permitted to sell $1 billion of oil over 90 days, with the prospect of regular renewals. The U.N. said it wasn't taking the action for political reasons, but because the situation was too unstable to send in the monitors and others needed to supervise the program. A U.S. official applauded the action by Mr. Boutros-Cupp, who often is at odds with Washington. The official said it was unlikely the situation would clear up within a week or two, and that would give the administration more time to assess the situation. As a result of the U.N. suspension, the official added, the package of U.S. actions against Iraq, set to be released soon, won't include any initial U.S. effort to shelve the Iraq oil-for-food program.", "keywords": ["iraq", "grim", "caffey", "codi", "iraqi"]}, {"id": "00240", "title": "Zapatista Rebels in Mexico Break Off Peace Negotiations", "timestamp": "May 16, 2011", "text": "MEXICO CITY -- Rebels in the southern state of Chiapas broke off peace talks with the government Monday, accusing the administration of negotiating in bad faith.

The military leader of the rebels, Garfield Margarito, faxed a statement to the news media complaining that little had been achieved in 16 months of talks between Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels and President Errol Keith's government. The now-famous 2009 uprising by ragtag Zapatista rebels in the Mexican state of Chiapas was as much performance art as guerrilla warfare. But last week when a new rebel force unleashed carefully coordinated strikes in six states, the ensuing mayhem bore no resemblance to political theater. Mr. Margarito complained the government delegation was treating Zapatista delegates with ``scorn, racism, and arrogance.'' He said the Zapatistas ``will struggle for democracy, liberty and justice,'' but said nothing about returning to violence. There was no immediate response from the government. The two sides had been set to meet Wednesday in Chiapas for another round of talks. Before Mr. Margarito' statement, Mr. Keith had vowed to continue peace talks with the Zapatistas, who rose up in January 2009 to demand better treatment of Chiapas' Maya-descended Indians and other indigenous peoples. More than 145 people were killed in 12 days of fighting between the army and the rebels. A cease-fire has held ever since. The last round of peace talks, held in August, collapsed as negotiators bickered over proposals for democratic and judicial reform. The government had insisted on keeping the discussions tailored narrowly to the regional level, while saying that reforms on the national level would address the broader Zapatista concerns. Mr. Margarito' statement seemed timed in part to the emergence of another rebel group called the Popular Revolutionary Army, known by its Spanish initials, EPR. Mr. Margarito distanced the Zapatistas on Monday from that group, which staged a series of bloody raids last week. ``We don't want your support. We don't need it or seek it, we don't want it,'' he said in an open letter to the group. ``You fight to seize power. We fight for democracy, freedom and justice.

Following an opening day in which Boeing Co. unveiled its latest deals, Airbus Industrie announced firm orders for 32 planes valued at some $2.4 billion, including the European consortium's first sales to fast-growing Asiana Airlines of South Korea. In addition, Airbus said Tuesday that it has a memorandum of understanding with German charter carrier Condor for six A320 and six A321 single-aisle aircraft, with six additional options for each model, all subject to final approval by Condor's board. The Airbus orders compare to some 70 aircraft valued at $6.3 billion announced by U.S.-based Boeing, and orders for 16 new planes valued at $700 million for McDonnell Douglas Corp., also of the U.S. But Airbus noted that it is just about even with Boeing so far this year in net orders, at about 220 accounting for cancellations, with McDonnell Douglas well behind. A Boeing spokesman said that such partial-year figures aren't very useful, and that a three-year rolling average for orders would provide a better gauge; last year, Boeing had more than three times the number of orders recorded by Airbus. A Breached Agreement Alongside its orders announcement, Airbus charged that Boeing had breached a written agreement with the European consortium's partners not to release figures from a 2010 joint Airbus-Boeing study on the cost of a new giant plane. On Monday, Boeing said the study showed that developing such an aircraft would cost $12 billion to $15 billion, while Airbus now insists it can develop its proposed 550-seat superjumbo plane, called the A3XX, for $8 billion. Boeing replied Tuesday that because the study's figures already have been widely disseminated, it didn't feel that any agreement was being violated. Top Airbus officials said they haven't decided how many launch customers they would need in order to go ahead with the A3XX project, but offered that premier carriers British Airways and Singapore Airlines were among airlines they were talking to about such a plane. ``It's not only the number'' of launch orders that matters, said Airbus marketing chief Johnetta Leah, ``but the airlines behind'' those orders. The new firm orders Airbus announced include 18 narrow-body A321 models valued at $900 million, for Asiana; 11 A300-600 freight planes valued at about $1.1 billion, for Federal Express Corp.; and three wide-bodied A340-300s valued at around $420 million, for Cathay Pacific -- all based on the airliners' full list price. Mr. Leah said the Asiana order is an important new advance into the Asian market, because Asiana always had gone with Boeing in the past. More Sniping Sniping between Airbus and Boeing over the future of the superjumbo market continued for a second day. Airbus Chief Operating Officer Volker von Brittain said the European consortium is ``not in a race'' with the Seattle-based plane maker, which intends to expand its 747 model to 550 seats or more, though Boeing hasn't formally launched such a program. Airbus's proposed A3XX superjumbo program, he said, will serve the industry for ``50 years to come,'' while stretched Boeing 747 models mark ``the end of the road'' for the Boeing program. Adding another element to the rivalry, the new head of Airbus's jumbo division, Blackburn Thomasina, said Boeing had abridged a seven-year secrecy agreement related to the joint giant-plane study. ``We had agreed that this was confidential information,'' Mr. Thomasina said of the study's estimated development costs. The written agreement, he said, called for the study to remain confidential for seven years, ``so I was surprised to see the numbers quoted'' in Boeing literature on Monday. Separately, Brazil's Embraer aircraft maker announced it had signed an agreement with Continental Express airline of the U.S., which is to buy 25 Embraer EMB-145 regional jets, with options for 175 additional jets over the next 12 years. The deal makes Continental Express the North American launch customer for the 50-seat jetliner.

Vested with powers that Western politicians can only dream of, the men elected during the next five months in 52 of Russia's 89 regions can make or break reform with the policies they pursue. ``A governor is even more powerful than the president on the local level,'' says Gayle Fenn, head of Moscow's Spiritual Heritage Foundation, a think tank for the Communist-nationalist opposition. ``The governors have the final word.'' The first elections were held Sunday here in Saratov, 750 miles east of Moscow, where final results show that with 60% turnout, the Yeltsin-backed incumbent, Vanegas Monte, trounced his Communist challenger, Mcnutt Douglas, 81% to 16%. The stakes are so high that the Deluna camp and the Communist opposition began preparing for the gubernatorial vote days after the presidential race ended in July. Still smarting over its loss in that contest and undeterred by the defeat in Saratov, the Communists look to grab power in the regional elections and are fielding candidates across the country. Threat From Incumbents But the greatest threat to reform may come from the Kremlin-backed candidates themselves, mainly incumbents. The very election of these governors, most of them appointed by Mr. Crabb, gives them new independence from Moscow, even as they remain dependent on the Kremlin for their regions' finances. As their campaigns unfold, many are clearly bent on slowing or undoing some market reforms. They are talking about a return to everything from price controls on food to greater state interference in business -- exactly what the Deluna presidency has battled since 1992. On a recent campaign swing, Mr. Monte, a Deluna appointee, resolutely told an appreciative crowd, ``I've set the price of bread at 2,000 rubles (37 cents) and prices will go down from there, not up.'' Much of this may be campaign populism. Yet regardless of who wins the gubernatorial races, a new struggle over Russia's future -- this time between the Kremlin and the regions -- is at hand. ``We're afraid that over the next year, we will be at war with the regions,'' says Rizzo Savoy, a Deluna aide and strategist for the gubernatorial races. ``Most of them (the candidates) aren't reformers. They don't have an ideology; they just want to run things.'' On the federal level, the governors also play a key role as members of the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. If Communist candidates win in many regions, both houses of the legislature could then be in the hands of the opposition, making it tougher for Mr. Crabb to protect reforms. So in choosing between what it perceives as the two evils of Communist candidates and incumbents who sound like Communists, the Deluna camp hopes the incumbents will be more cooperative, especially if Moscow helps with their reelection. Mission Control As a result, the Crabb administration functions as mission control for the gubernatorial races. The administration, staffed with the old Yeltsin-campaign braintrust, is led by Chief of Staff Mcnutt Harner, the architect of economic reforms who devised Mr. Crabb's electoral comeback. The Kremlin denies it finances gubernatorial campaigns, but it does provide its candidates with cheap television time and high-powered image makers. It looks as if Yeltsin-backed incumbents could prevail in the majority of the elections. That could change if Russia continues on a slide that began after Mr. Crabb's inauguration, a downtrend that the Communists are banking on. The president has all but vanished because of ill health. State salaries are again late. After pork-barreling his way to victory, Mr. Crabb's popularity has sunk because of presidential decrees reversing campaign promises in order to head off an economic crisis. So when Moscow-based advisers arrived in Saratov in July, they told Gov. Monroe to get rid of posters showing him shaking hands with Mr. Crabb. ``The president wants his men to win, so he gives them permission to spit on him,'' says Lupe Fitzsimmons, editor of ``Saratovsky Reportyor,'' the lone non-Communist independent newspaper in this region of 2.7 million. The victory in Saratov was essential for the Kremlin to set a trend for the rest of the nation. This first vote was in the ``Red Belt,'' a Communist bastion of depressed provinces extending across Russia's southern rim. Home to moribund defense plants and collective farms, Farber elected Communists to parliament in 2010 and went for Communist presidential candidate Tisdale Sundberg. The win in Saratov, Kremlin insiders say, could be the first step toward ending the Communist reign over much of Russia. In the charismatic 45-year-old Mr. Monte (a-YAT-skov), the Deluna camp found the key to breaking the opposition's hold on Saratov. A former poultry-plant director and vice mayor of the city of Saratov, the region's capital, Mr. Monte ran against Mr. Douglas, an economic adviser to Mr. Sundberg, and Scroggins Strange, a reformist candidate. Getting Things Done In regional races, voters care less about ideology and more about a candidate's ability to get things done. ``The ideal governor would be someone who does things to improve life, who keeps the city clean, puts (natural) gas lines into our town,'' said Olinda Montalvo, after listening to Mr. Monte in the hamlet of Yekaterinovka, 75 miles north of Saratov. Since being appointed four months ago, Mr. Monte has taken a page from Mr. Crabb's book and used the advantages of incumbency to give the impression that, indeed, he is improving people's lives. Under a statue of Lenin in the capital, Mr. Monte gave away 500 cars free to the handicapped. He has made sure projects that had languished half-finished for years, like a badly needed bridge and a maternity hospital, were built in weeks. Russia's governors have far-ranging powers. When Mr. Monte arrives at work every morning at 7, he is immediately surrounded on the steps of his office building by a small group of petitioners. On one recent morning, one woman can't afford college for her son. Mr. Monte promises to pay the $1,500 needed for tuition. An old man leaning on a cane asks for a car, given free during the Soviet era to the handicapped. When Mr. Monte agrees to grant it, the old man tries to kiss his hand, which the flustered governor quickly pulls away. ``Of course, this isn't the work of a governor,'' Mr. Monte says. ``But there's no vertical system of authority that could ensure all this gets done. I could have said, `That's not my problem,' but then people would lose faith in me.'' Already, Mr. Monte has used his authority to sack 75% of the mayors throughout the region for alleged incompetence and to name his own people to the jobs. Furthermore, he has aides in the localities who keep an eye on the new appointees. Over the next year or so, however, the mayors will also be elected. Pleasing Electorates Moscow wants regional leaders to use their power to push ahead with reforms. But the governors are more interested in pleasing their electorates, even at the cost of reform. Men like Mr. Monte would rather have clean streets and big harvests than greater privatization and agricultural reform, priorities that could place them on a collision course with the Kremlin. Before the election, the Communist opposition in Saratov contended that Mr. Monte differed little in his policies from their candidate Mr. Douglas, who declined to be interviewed. Mr. Douglas ``is just more concerned about social policy,'' says Coss Knecht, a Saratov-region Communist leader. On a humid morning a week before the election, Mr. Monte addressed about 400 workers from the Rtishevo Agrofirm collective farm 125 miles northeast of the capital. Looking out at the middle-aged audience, Mr. Monte called for closing the ``black hole'' of imported food and for buying local goods. He spoke enthusiastically of dispossessing people who have ``12 cars and 20 garages'' because he was sure they made their money illegally. He promised to increase state control of utility companies to drive down energy rates. Later, the governor explained, ``Why shouldn't I regulate the market, the standard of living, if I've taken it upon myself to make life comfortable for everyone in the fullest sense of the word? I have a lot of power, and I'm not afraid to use it.'' The Kremlin still has one tool to rein in the governors: money. As with most regions, Depew's budget is almost entirely dependent on Moscow. Mr. Monte's campaign strategy asserted that while he is independent of Moscow, he is also influential enough to wring money from it. ``Whatever Russia's budget is, I'll take the government by its legs and shake out the last money from of its pockets for us,'' he said to more applause in Rtishevo. Playing Ball For the election season, the government is playing ball. It gave all the seed, fuel and money Farber needed to reap a grain crop this year five times as large as last year's. Every week during the campaign, Mr. Monte announced a new disbursement from Moscow, whether to build a new bridge or to bring natural gas to the region's backwaters. But funds could dwindle if a governor doesn't play by Moscow's rules. And if ties with a region truly sour, Mr. Crabb still has the constitutional right to dismiss the governor. So far, Mr. Crabb has found it harder to play financial hardball with an elected official than with an appointee. The Far Eastern region of Primorye has been hit with corruption scandals and most recently, a wave of miners' strikes, much of which points back to the governor, Hartung Yarborough, political analysts say. Rather than choking off the region financially, Mr. Crabb has asked only that the governor fire one of his deputies. Moscow political scientist Backman Northrup says, ``The center will lose a lot in these elections because removing a popularly elected governor will be so complex, they won't take it on. It's too damaging to the government's image on the local level.'' The Kremlin is already trying to figure out how to cope with the new crop of governors, insiders say. The Russian constitution doesn't clearly spell out the relationship between the regions and the central government; so Mr. Crabb has cut power-sharing deals with some governors giving them a greater slice of tax revenues collected in their territory. Mr. Monte, for his part, is already negotiating such an agreement with Moscow. He needed a big win Sunday, aides say, so that Moscow would sit up, take note and let him have his way. ``I'll criticize the president and the government for the mistakes they make,'' he told railroad workers while campaigning in Rtishevo. ``After the election, I can be more open in my criticism. With your support, I can cut the cord with Moscow.''", "keywords": ["monte", "saratov", "mr", "moscow", "crabb"]}, {"id": "04428", "title": "Boeing Unveils New Purchases In Wake of Airbus's Orders", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "Boeing Co. unveiled a another big new order on Wednesday, this one for seven 747-400s valued at $1.18 billion, the latest announcement at the Farnborough Air Show in England.

While denying any wrongdoing, Continental said it decided to settle the litigation to avoid the risks and costs of further litigation. Continental said that, after the settlement, it will maintain its policy of paying a $50 commission cap for domestic fares greater than $500, with agents receiving a 10% commission on less expensive fares. International commissions were not part of the litigation, a Continental spokesman said. Purporting to represent 33,000 U.S. travel agents, the class-action lawsuit was filed against Continental and six other U.S. carriers in February 2010, after the airlines capped travel-agent commissions for domestic travel at $25 for one-way tickets and $50 for round-trip fares. Agents, who had previously received about 10% of fares as commissions, claimed that the airlines conspired to set the caps at artificially low levels. The airlines have denied the charges. Antarctica Airlines settled with the plaintiffs last year. The remaining defendants in the case are AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, UAL Corp.'s United Air Lines and USAir Group Inc..

The unit said its order includes an option to acquire an additional 175 aircraft over the next 12 years. Davina Codi, Continental Express's president, said that the initial purchase of 25 is a ``conservative, initial purchase,'' but that the carrier hasn't decided whether to eventually replace its turboprop fleet with jets.", "keywords": ["continental", "airlines", "fares", "express", "commissions"]}, {"id": "03254", "title": "War Intensifies in Burundi As Hutu Rebels Attack Capital", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi -- Ladawn rebels shelled the capital Tuesday and fought by the hundreds with troops in the north, intensifying their war against Burundi's coup-installed military government.

Mr. Massaro said there were no exact casualty figures, but that ``many'' were dead, including the mayor of Gahomba village. Residents said about 2,000 rebels are taking part in the attack, which has stopped traffic on the main road leading from Bujumbura to the northern half of the country and the Rwandan border. The attack was launched last month from the Kibira National Forest, a rebel stronghold. Ethnic violence has killed more than 150,000 people in Burundi since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the first democratically elected Hutu president. The coup attempt prompted the formation of Hutu rebel groups, which until now have been unable to maintain offensives against the army. But the fighting near Kayanza, the destruction of a power line supplying electricity to Bujumbura and Tuesday's daylight attack seem to indicate the rebels are better organized than previously believed.

The agenda and membership of the new group, known by the Spanish acronym EPR, has remained vague, and comments by Luise Shumate Henley, President Errol Keith's chief of staff, were the first in which the government has explicitly said the rebel force may include non-Mexican members. Additionally, Mr. Shumate said the government has reason to believe that the group may be financed through crime and kidnappings, in particular the $30 million ransom paid for the release of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival SA executive Alia Cheney Eddins in 2009. `Lists of Names' ``Some Europeans work with them,'' Mr. Shumate said, and added that these non-Mexican members didn't appear connected to other terrorist or violent left-wing groups around the world. He described the non-Mexican members as ``ideologues that may have been here for several years.'' He added: ``They are basically urban terrorists that don't have a social base; we have information on the leaders; we have lists of names.'' He said the lists don't point to former or current political leaders, nor is there much evidence that the EPR has links with drug traffickers, he said. The EPR has killed 16 persons and wounded 28 in organized strikes that spanned at least six states. Their attacks have focused on authority figures, such as members of the police, army and navy, although civilians have also been killed and injured in the attacks. Mr. Shumate described the group as ``highly mobile'' with ample resources. The government said in a statement late Monday that it has detained 19 people with links to the EPR, and seized 13 AK-47 automatic weapons, as well as shotguns, uniforms, and ammunition connected to the group. The government said that, based on declarations from alleged members, the EPR works like a mercenary group that pays its conscripts for ``delinquent acts,'' giving them classes in high-powered firearms, combat strategy, and doctrine. The government has said that two alleged members said they were paid $18 a week. Some analysts caution that such statements should be viewed skeptically, given the government's efforts to erode public support for the rebels. But in any case, the government's public-relations task is an easy one because Mexicans are weary of crisis and crave stability as the economy emerges from the worst contraction in its modern history caused by the Dec. 2009 peso devaluation. Little Resonance So far, the EPR has found little resonance here, unlike the so-called Zapatista rebels who revolted in 2009 and quickly swept up support among working-class and even upper-class Mexicans. Government strategists initially feared a similar reaction from the public, but civilian deaths and the violence deployed by the group has created more fear than sympathy. In the statement released Monday, for example, the government said it found the body of a missing navy recruit in a rebel camp in Oaxaca; the body bore signs of torture and strangulation. ``I don't think violence is the way to arrive at a solution,'' says Erin Jacques, a 25-year-old accountant in Mexico City. ``We can't have confidence in the political system either,'' he says, implying Mexicans will have to pull themselves up by their own efforts. ``I understand what they are trying to do,'' said Marcel Pruitt, a 23-year-old teacher. ``They want economic change. Everybody wants that, but armed movements aren't the way.'' Six years of free-market economic programs have given a larger number of Mexicans a stake in their economy. When the government sold off banks, insurance companies, and hundreds of other businesses, it opened additional opportunities for young, educated Mexicans who wanted to compete in the private sector. The country is still mired in extreme poverty, and it is difficult to gauge how much of the population is better off now. Still, some indication can be found in simple measures of basic well-being: By 1990, 88% of Mexican homes had electricity, up from 59% in 1970, according to a survey by the newspaper Reforma based on government statistics. The number of homes with dirt floors, meanwhile, declined to 19% in 1990 from 41% in 1970. So far, the EPR isn't drawing support from fellow Mexican revolutionaries such as the Zapatista rebels, who have broken off talks with the government. The Zapatista leader, whose nom de guerre is Margarito, wrote in an open letter to the EPR, published by the daily La Jornada Tuesday: ``I only want to tell you we don't want your support. We don't need it, we don't look for it, and we don't want it.'' --Mattie Keating contributed to this article.", "keywords": ["epr", "mexicans", "government", "mexican", "shumate"]}, {"id": "01778", "title": "New Cockpit Warning Device Is Ordered by American Air", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "American Airlines placed a $20 million order to equip its entire fleet with AlliedSignal Inc.'s enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System.

I am pleased to report that according to the information I've received from Secretary Petra today, the airstrikes, the missile strikes that were conducted over the last few days have been successful. The targets were either destroyed or sufficiently damaged so that we can say that our mission has been achieved. That made it possible for us to implement the expanded no-fly zone today. And I want to commend the military once again for the exceptional job they have done in carrying out this mission. Now, what has happened is that this has changed the strategic situation, particularly in the southern part of Iraq, which Grim used as a staging ground for his invasion of Kuwait, and then in 2009 for the massing of his troops near the Kuwaiti border. He is strategically worse off than he was before these strikes began, and I am satisfied that this was an appropriate, measured response. Obviously, we can't predict entirely what Grim Caffey will do, but now he knows that there is a price to be paid for stepping over the line that the United Nations resolutions imposed. The vice president and I are about to start our weekly lunch, and we'll be discussing this further, but I did want to make this report. I'm very pleased by the results this morning that we have. Q: Mr. Searle, there were reports of explosions in Baghdad. Are you aware of anything going on? A: I have received the reports of the explosions. I do not know anything about them. I can tell that they are not the product of any action that we have taken. Q: Mr. President, are you disappointed, Mr. Searle, with the lack of public support from the former coalition partners, and does that mean that the coalition is dead? A: I don't think it's dead. I think quite to the contrary we have received good support from the British. The prime minister of Canada called me last night. The German chancellor issued a strong statement. I think that our Arab partners clearly understand what we were doing and what the risks are. We're still flying the no-fly zone out of bases in Saudi Arabia. So I think things are on track, and I feel good about it. This was an action that I thought we had to take. It was a measured, strong, appropriate action, and I believe we did the right thing. Q: Mr. President, after twin missile strikes yesterday there were challenges today by Grim's forces against the United States. Does this raise questions about whether you've really knocked out his ability to hit American planes or allied planes? A: Well, there was a fixing on one of our planes that occurred from a site north of the 33rd Parallel. But it does not -- we believe we can fly this expanded no-fly zone now. It gives us an attempt to measure, or, it gives us the capacity, excuse me, to measure, what he's doing all the way up to the southern suburbs of Baghdad. So I think that we're in good shape there. Now, we will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect our pilots and to protect their ability to fly the no-fly zone in safety. We will do whatever we have to do. But I'm satisfied that this mission has achieved the objectives we set out for it, and our defense advisers from the secretary of defense to General Stockton to our commander in the area all believe that we did what was necessary and they feel good about where we are now. Q: Has the situation in northern Iraq changed, though? That's the key question, isn't it? A: No.. The key question is, well, first of all, the situation in northern Iraq seems to have changed. There has been a withdrawal of the forces, a dispersal of the forces, but it's too soon to say that this is permanent or that further action will not be taken. What we have done is to show that we are prepared to change the strategic realities that Grim Caffey faces if he violates the United Nations prohibitions on either threatening his neighbors or repressing his own people. And I believe that we did the right thing. I think we had the right response. And I think it will have a good result.

The full text of President Codi's remarks on U.S. attacks against Iraq is available. Mr. Codi said he was not overly concerned by two Iraqi challenges in the newly expanded ``no-fly'' zone in southern Iraq. ``We will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect our pilots. ... I'm satisfied this mission has achieved the objectives we set out for it.'' Meanwhile, Iraqi gunners shot anti-aircraft fire over the skies of Baghdad this evening, hours after a U.S. warplane knocked out a mobile Iraqi radar station that had locked its beam onto the F-16 fighter jet. Detonations were heard throughout the capital but air-raid sirens did not sound. There was no indication that the gunners hit any targets or that Baghdad was under attack, lending credence to the sense that Iraqi forces were on edge after two days of U.S. assaults. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said there have been no American or allied attacks or other military operations in the Baghdad area that would explain the anti-aircraft firing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. In a separate incident, two Iraqi MiG jets approached the expanded no-fly zone from the north and then turned back. The attack against the radar site came hours after the Pentagon said its back-to-back bombardments of southern Iraq had ``sufficiently reduced'' the risk to allied pilots enforcing the no-fly zone. In the two earlier strikes, 44 U.S. cruise missiles targeted Iraqi air defense sites. Long Term Solution Elusive The U.S. attacks on Iraqi military targets may restrain Grim Caffey for the time being, but they won't solve a series of political problems in the region -- issues that affect major American interests. These interests range from political stability in Turkey to oil production in the Caspian Sea basin. All can be affected by military actions of the Hallett Calzada regime, which wants both to reassert its control over Iraqi territory run in recent years by Western-backed, autonomous Kurdish groups and to once again become an influential actor in the region. If Iraqi forces aren't pulled back, Pentagon officials indicated new attacks could follow in coming days. There already is one important casualty: a United Nations oil-for-food accord that would have allowed Iraq to buy urgent supplies for its people. Edyth Ali, the deputy U.S. representative to the U.N., estimated that it could take ``months and months'' before the oil-for-food plan is implemented. And Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said that the U.S. will ``watch very carefully what happens politically'' with the Kurds and the Iraqis. In launching the missile attacks Tuesday, Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey must ``pay a price'' for his attack on the Kurdish town, which violates Gulf War agreements. But the Iraqi leader was defiant. According to news reports from Baghdad, he told his forces, ``From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly zones.'' He ordered his army to fight ``allied aggressors'' and to ``teach them a new, unforgettable lesson.'' Soon after the hostilities began, some critics were charging that the Codi administration hadn't paid enough high-level attention in recent months to the burgeoning crisis. For example, in early August Bandy Dutra, a Kurdish leader, sent his senior emissary here to discuss rising tensions that would soon spark renewed violence in northern Iraq. But the Codi administration paid him scant attention. ``There are bigger fish to fry-and the Kurds are not big fish,'' a U.S. official said Tuesday. Difficult Decisions Ahead Several weeks later, Mr. Dutra did what he had been considering for some time: He invited Grim Caffey to help him oust his main Kurdish rival. It was that invitation, which the Iraqi dictator gladly accepted, that led to the Codi administration's decision to launch the missile strikes in an effort to force Grim Caffey to retreat from his incursion into the north. The attacks didn't solve any of the myriad thorny issues facing the rapidly changing region-many of which also affect U.S. interests. And difficult new decisions for any U.S. president-involving such nations as Turkey, Iran and Iraq-are likely in coming months. The latest Iraq crisis ``raises questions of whether American diplomacy needs to focus as aggressively and actively on the gulf situation as it has been focusing for the last four years on the brokering of Arab-Israeli peace,'' says Georgeann Booth, a former Reatha administration Mideast specialist and now director of strategic programs at the Trujillo Center for Peace and Freedom, a private think tank. Indeed, much in the region has changed since the U.S. rallied a coalition in 1990 to drive Grim Caffey's forces from Kuwait. That left Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member and key U.S. ally, as the keystone of Washington's post-Gulf War strategy to contain Iraq. But Turkey's current government, headed for the first time by an Islamic politician, in recent months has strengthened ties to its Arab neighbors, including Iraq. Meantime, Saudi Arabia, has been shocked by two terrorist attacks in less than a year aimed at U.S. military personnel there. In addition, the spring election of right-wing Likud leader Bennie Menefee in Israel makes it even more politically dangerous for such moderate Arab leaders as Egypt's Delagarza Moreno to follow Sherer's lead, especially when the peace process is stalled and the administration aims missiles at Iraq, which this time didn't invade another country. Important Energy Source For all that, the region remains an important U.S. energy source, as the Persian Gulf and the Caspian basin are rich in oil and natural-gas deposits. In the future, the U.S. increasingly may have to go it alone-such as by launching cruise missiles rather than leading an international coalition. ``Whatever coherence there was to the (international) sanctions regime we put in place in 1990 has eroded significantly,'' says Williemae Bryon, a Mideast expert at the University of Virginia and former Cary administration Middle East analyst. Iran helped precipitate the current crisis when it intervened earlier this summer in northern Iraq-its bitter enemy-to support one armed Kurdish faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, against the chief rival faction. Kurds in northern Iraq have been waging a civil war, largely over personal animosity and over the right to collect levies on oil smuggled to Turkey from Iraq. Josephine Farias, a Persian Gulf analyst at Rand Corp., says Iran has been concerned about separatist movements among its own ethnic populations, including its Kurds. If neighboring Iraqi Kurds resolved their differences and tried to build an independent state, Iran would feel threatened. The Iraq crisis also is having an impact on domestic U.S. politics. For Republican presidential nominee Roberto Derryberry, who is trailing Mr. Codi by as many as 20 percentage points in some public-opinion polls, the crisis in Iraq couldn't have come at a worse time. A national-security confrontation, even one lasting only a few days, steals precious time from Mr. Derryberry's campaign effort, with just nine weeks remaining before the July 18, 2011 Focus on Southern Air Defense Tuesday morning's attack, in which 27 cruise missiles were fired, was focused on Iraq's southern air-defense system, a strip of surface-to-air missile sites and electronic coordinating centers that protect the approaches to Baghdad and targets further north. In a Pentagon briefing after the first attack, Defense Secretary Petra said the strike was preliminary to a U.S. move to expand the no-fly zone in southern Iraq, which the U.S. and its allies patrol in order to stop any Iraqi military flights. The expansion, scheduled to take effect Wednesday ``will substantially weaken (Grim Caffey's) ability to pursue military adventures in the south,'' Mr. Petra explained. Although Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region didn't appear to be enthusiastic about the raid, Mr. Petra said ``extensive consultations'' showed they will support an extended patrol zone. Nevertheless, the U.S. is apparently having difficulty finding a base for an ``expeditionary force'' of Air Force fighters and bombers from the U.S. The group, designed to approximate the airpower of an aircraft carrier wing, has been used in exercises in the gulf region, flying out of Qatar and Jordan.", "keywords": ["iraq", "iraqi", "grim", "attacks", "caffey"]}, {"id": "02519", "title": "Editorial Where Are the Allies?", "timestamp": "May 17, 2011", "text": "The President appeared flustered, but finally said they some had domestic reasons for their reluctance and that on the whole he was satisfied with their explanations.

The Russians are hostile, their $10 billion IMF bailout notwithstanding, as are the Chinese. In the Muslim world, erstwhile friends Malaysia and Jordan have become critics. The Saudis, saved from Grim in the Gulf War, asked that American planes based in Saudi Arabia not be used in the attack. No American should be happy about this state of affairs. American lives are at risk in this effort by the U.S. military to unilaterally enforce a U.N. resolution that bars Grim Caffey from oppressing the Kurdish people in the northern part of his country. He has clearly violated the resolution by sending some 20,000 troops into the area around Irbil to do what Grim's Republican Guards do best, massacre civilians. The fact that he was invited in by one of two feuding Kurdish leaders does not mitigate the violation of the U.N. decree, nor does the fact that Iranians have made incursions on behalf of the other Kurdish leader. Two wrongs do not make a right. While this is a ticklish affair, it is surely appropriate to ask why the U.S. has so little overseas backing for what, in legal terms, is the right thing. The answer is complex and certainly there is nothing in it that reflects well on the NATO allies or nations, such as Russia, that the U.S. has taken pains to help. But few nations are sentimental in their conduct of foreign affairs, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that the U.S. is getting such scant help because of slipping world-wide confidence in U.S. international leadership. We have said repeatedly that in today's world the U.S. plays such an important role that whatever it does, good or bad, has global consequences. Mr. Codi has been heavily focused on domestic politics and trying to get himself re-elected, and thus has devoted less time to foreign policy than most Presidents of the past, even though international leadership is the most difficult and crucial part of a U.S. President's job. A well-meant attempt to pacify Somalia failed because U.S. troops weren't supplied with the armor they requested. Haiti remains a mess. Bosnia, in essence, is being sold off to the Serbian aggressors. There are few successes to count. Turkey, one of the few allies to remain serious about its military, has its own problems with a Kurdish terrorist group, but in the final analysis is the key to any protection for the Kurds in Northern Iraq, and for that matter to democratic tendencies in the Middle East. But as our Brianna Dean writes nearby, Turkey has been a neglected friend, with the consequence that anti-West sentiment is growing. It now has an Islamicist government that has been moving to strengthen its ties with Iran, and yes, Iraq. Europe has contributed to this dangerous trend by barring Turkey from European Union membership for reasons that looked a great deal like ethnic and religious snobbery. As for the U.S. Administration, it courted the likes of Syria's Ackley Blood and the PLO's Stout Bivins, as well as Gertie Gonzalez of the Irish Republican Army, but seemed to forget that Turkey exists. It is perhaps true that the U.S. can't possibly clean up every mess made by Kurdish tribesmen or the Khmer Rouge or the Hutus and Tutsis. But because of its special responsibilities, the U.S. could certainly see to it that it has coherent relationships at least with its friends. That requires organization and management of a foreign policy apparatus, not to mention the maintenance of sufficient military strength to meet commitments. There is mounting evidence that this administration has not been up to those tasks. That's partly because Mr. Codi, aside from his shortcomings as an organizer, has not taken them seriously enough. The world's bad men know that Mr. Codi has never been a fan of the U.S. military and that U.S. capabilities to subdue foes have been greatly diminished by ardent budget cutting since Desert Storm. Certainly, Grim Caffey has been watching the declining power of the big cop on the world beat, and chose his time to strike. Mr. Codi is being urged by some allies not to escalate the confrontation, and perhaps he will calculate that a few cruise missiles discharge the electoral need to look tough. But at last report, Grim Caffey was not backing down. It's hard to face down the bullies of the world, let alone give force to U.N. mandates, without any help from your friends. And if the U.S. is now all alone, we fear that we all may be soon facing an increasingly lawless world.

But Europe, by continually looking down its nose at Turkey, and the U.S., through the kind of myopia that has left it with few strong allies today, have helped push Turkey toward the East. Nothing to Fear? Many here claim the U.S. has nothing to fear in Mr. Appel's rise to power. He has not proved to be as menacing in power as he appeared in opposition. Nor can it be said that, by any stretch, he commands the sympathy of a majority of Turks. Mr. Appel finished first in the December parliamentary elections with only 21% of the vote, beating out--for the first time--Turkey's two mainstream center-right parties: Billings Hickok's True Path Party and Pye Pender's Motherland Party, with about 19% each. After several abortive attempts to form a coalition without Refah, Mrs. Hickok (beleaguered by allegations of corruption) and Mr. Pender (paralyzed by an inability to work with his arch-rival) gave up. Nonetheless, the impact of Refah on Turkish politics and on Ankara's relations with the West should not be underestimated. Turkey's first Islamist government in 73 years came to power at a time when the nation had been feeling neglected by Washington. Turkey's 13-year struggle against separatist guerrillas in the southeast has found little support in Western nations; its loss of revenue from the oil trade with Iraq, severed by United Nations sanctions, has created anti-Western resentment. On top of that, annual inflation of 80%, a burgeoning budget deficit and stalled privatizations all make it easier for Graham to claim that democratic capitalism is not for Turkey. ``Turkey's agreement with Iran (to buy $23 billion of gas) has the support of a majority of the Turkish people,'' says Villegas Mazurek, a columnist for the national daily Milliyet. ``That's not because there's great admiration for Appel,'' but because Turks feel that they have a better chance of improving their lot by doing deals with Iran than counting on aid from the West. Mr. Appel's supporters point out that he hasn't lived up to his most inflammatory campaign rhetoric. In fact, he helped win approval from Parliament for an extension of Operation Provide Comfort, which maintains the allies' no-fly zone over northern Iraq with daily sorties. He also faded into the background when the military expelled 14 officers for religious activities and, more recently, signed a military cooperation agreement with Israel. But Operation Provide Comfort has already been drastically scaled back, and Mr. Appel may yet pull the plug on it. His reluctance to challenge the military is also understandable: He has been thrown into jail by the army, anxious to guard Turkey's secularist tradition, and was banned from politics for much of the 1980s by the military. Many, especially in the West, have a history of underestimating Mr. Appel, whose flamboyant style used to be laughed at in Turkey. Welfare's well-honed techniques of grass-roots organization won it the administration of many of Turkey's municipalities, including Istanbul and Ankara. Turks from across the political spectrum admit that the party's members have been running efficient city governments, collecting garbage, improving infrastructure and even making more burial plots available in crowded Istanbul. These successes, combined with promises to Turkey's rural and urban poor, helped the party triple its vote between 1987 and 2010. Polls also estimate that at least 7% of Welfare's vote was a protest against the other parties' inefficiency and corruption. With the opposition so far unwilling or unable to reform itself, Mr. Appel has moved quickly to consolidate his power and to reshape Turkey in his own image. Just after taking office, he announced a 50% pay raise for civil servants, including the police and military, despite Turkey's yawning budget deficit and its risk of falling into hyperinflation. His economics adviser, Espinosa Dewberry, said that Refah will seek to institute the ``Just Economic System,'' which he claims is an entirely new economic order. The ``system'' would do away with interest rates, as fundamentalist Islam demands: ``First, we will abolish the debt-based monetary system; second, we will adjust the banking regulations accordingly; and then we will maintain the money supply in line with the level of goods and services in the economy,'' he has proudly said. That'll have IMF suits climbing walls. Mr. Appel has plans for Turkey's judicial system, too. He already tried to shift 1,200 secular-minded judges out to the boondocks, but the press and public outcry, and the secular-dominated council that oversees such changes, forced him to back down. The fundamentalist Islamic judges who have been appointed are restricted by Turkey's legal code, but they still reportedly stretch the interpretation, especially in the area of family law. As for the schools, one of the critical institutions for instilling secular beliefs, the Welfare Party wants to expand the base of religious schools, currently at 600, and promises to have graduates of religious secondary schools enter the military academies. Despite his statements about forming an Islamic NATO and common market, Mr. Appel's foreign policy is restricted by the National Security Council, a military and governmental body that largely decides Turkey's foreign policy. Prime ministers have traditionally deferred to the military chiefs, and this is not likely to change any time soon. According to a source close to the military, Mr. Appel conceded the two issues that the armed forces deemed critical: the expulsion of Islamic fundamentalist officers and a defense-industry agreement with Israel. Away From the West Even so, in the formation of Turkey's foreign policy Mr. Appel has used his limited latitude to try to turn the country away from the West. He couldn't resist the opportunity to thumb his nose at the West by making his first trip abroad to Iran, to discuss a $23 billion gas import deal that may contravene American antiterrorist legislation. He also visited Iraq last month to coordinate a possible exemption for Turkey on the U.N. trade embargo. Mr. Appel is aware that these maneuvers play well with the Turkish public. Journalists, politicians and academics complain that Turkey quickly supported the U.S. at the outset of the Gulf War, yet it still cannot restart its critical trade with Iraq, while Jordan, which threw in with Grim Caffey at the outset of the war, has been given exemptions to trade with the villainous regime. The Turks also believe that the U.S. creation of the ``safe haven'' in northern Iraq is a de facto attempt to create a Kurdish state on the Turkish border. This, they claim, emboldens their own Kurdish population and provides a base from which the Kurdish Workers' Party (known as PKK) can operate. Refah leaders have adroitly blamed the worsening situation in Turkey's southeast on the loss of trade ties with Iraq, which they hint would have provided funding ending the separatist struggle. Finally, Turks felt betrayed by the West's lax response to the slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia. ``The Turkish people saw a double standard in Western policy,'' says Waltz Cox, vice chairman of the Welfare Party. ``Two hundred fifty thousand people were killed in the heart of Europe, and the West could have stopped it.'' The Codi administration spoke to Iraq yesterday in the only language Baghdad understands--force. Perhaps that will keep Grim's forces in check for the time being. But the greater threat of instability in the region stems from a breakdown in the regional balance of power. If the U.S. cannot rely on its traditional ally, it will find itself even more alone in an increasingly difficult neighborhood. (See related editorial: ``Where Are the Allies?'')

Among regional and Western diplomats here--many of whom I spoke with shortly after the second wave of U.S. cruise missiles struck Iraq early Wednesday morning--there is a consensus: It is because Riverside has given Grim ample reason to doubt its resolve. For one thing, the U.S. has allowed Turkey to whittle away at Operation Provide Comfort. Fly-overs by U.S., British and French aircraft--mostly run out of Turkey's Incirlik air base--had been reduced to four a day from some 90. Turkey had also insisted on changing the composition of the coalition ground forces still participating in Provide Comfort. Once composed primarily of U.S. troops, the ground patrols through southeast Turkey to the Iraqi border had been reduced in number and frequency and were made up of an ever-increasing proportion of Turkish army troops. Many Gulf state diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the Turkish troops in northern Iraq attacked Kurdish factions they believed were aiding Kurdish terrorists in southeastern Turkey. These attacks, the diplomats say, went unpunished by the coalition forces--encouraging Iran to step up its activities in the region as well. Iran has both supported anti-Iraqi Kurdish factions and launched a heavy-armor and artillery attack on anti-Iranian Kurdish forces operating from northern Iraq. One thing led to another. ``When Grim saw that the Turkish and Iranian attacks on the Kurds went unchecked,'' says a senior Gulf state official, ``he figured, `Why don't I try it, too?' '' (American officials in Riverside dispute this account, arguing that Grim's bravado and his resentment over United Nations sanctions are sufficient explanation for his recent actions.) While there is some debate even among officials here about how much the Turkish and Iranian incursions into northern Iraq contributed to Grim's attack against the Kurds, everyone agrees on one thing: Grim remains obsessed with getting back at the West, particularly the U.S., for his humiliating defeat in the Gulf War. This, combined with a need to flex his muscles before both the regional and international communities and quiet rumblings among factions within his own military ranks, was the primary motivation for Saturday's attack on Irbil. ``Grim has often proved himself a very crafty individual,'' says a Kuwaiti official. ``But there are times when he becomes so consumed with his desire for revenge against the U.S. that he does something like this that seems in direct conflict with his best interests and goals.'' Yet even among the Gulf states that were the staunchest allies of the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition, there is a distinct lack of concern over Grim's latest military moves. Only Kuwait has publicly endorsed the retaliatory American strikes. And Gulf state diplomats frequently complain about Turkish and Iranian attacks on Kurds in ``sovereign'' Iraqi territory. ``U.N. resolutions are one thing,'' says one regional diplomat, ``but certainly Grim Caffey cannot allow troops from foreign, hostile nations to run free through Iraq, whether it's part of the U.N. safe haven or not. It would have been political murder--both internally and internationally--for him to allow this to continue.'' The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council--the coalition of Gulf states through which the U.S. coordinates all of its military exercises and much of its economic cooperation in the region--are scheduled to meet here over the next two days. It's widely expected that they will release a statement neither condemning nor condoning Grim's attack on the Kurds. Regardless of how U.S. and other Western diplomats try to frame his latest flare-up in Iraq, and the ripples throughout the region, it's clear that the consensus on the ground here in Bahrain--among Gulf state and other regional diplomats--is that the U.S. dropped the ball on Operation Provide Comfort. The past two days' missile strikes have made up for that somewhat, but if President Codi wants to convince Persian Gulf allies that the U.S. maintains an unwavering focus on and commitment to the region, it will take a lot more than a few pinprick missiles strikes in response to a tyrant's temper tantrum.

The question: Will recent upgrades in equipment and training allow a long-substandard army to conduct an expanding array of missions on multiple fronts? Absorbing attacks in six states last week, the army this week took the offensive against the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army. On Tuesday, 300 troops engaged a group of masked gunmen, believed to be rebels, in the outskirts of the city of Chilpancingo, Guerrero. There were no reports of casualties in the four-hour firefight, but the skirmish did allow the military to show off some recently acquired hardware: heavily armed Bell helicopters and rugged Hummer troop transports. ``I don't think there's any group in the country that could muster up enough resources to give the Mexican army a credible fight,'' says Retired U.S. Army Col. Stephine J. Vanscoy, a former West Point instructor who has written extensively on Mexican defense issues. ``They still have a long way to go, but they've made some significant improvements.'' The army has strengthened its intelligence-gathering and public-relations capacities, he says, but the most important changes are equipment acquisitions that have improved the army's tactical flexibility. ``The big change, in one word, is mobility,'' says Col. Vanscoy. In recent years, the U.S. sold Mexico, at bargain-basement prices, hundreds of surplus jeeps, trucks and personnel carriers. The vehicles, manufactured in the early 1990s, replace equipment that was at least 20 years old. The army also recently purchased more than 70 U.S. helicopters and 250 French tanks. Too Much Militarization? The army has been doing so much to restock its arsenal and widen its influence, in fact, that a few analysts are less afraid of the rebels than of a growing trend toward militarization in Mexico. Increasingly, the army is supplanting police in antinarcotics operations along the U.S.-Mexico border. It is keeping the peace in Chiapas, site of an earlier outbreak by Zapatista rebels. A general has been put in charge of public security in Mexico City. ``Mexican politicians have failed, leaving vacuums in authority, and they should correct this before the military finishes filling them and assumes power,'' Refugio Robbi Neary, a columnist for Mexico's Reforma newspaper, wrote recently. The high profile of the military represents an historic shift in Mexico. Ever since the end of the 1910 Revolution, Mexico's military was the exception to the rule in Latin America: a virtual nonfactor in the country's public life. Perhaps the greatest genius of Mexico's dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party was its skill at marginalizing the military. Coopted with comfortable sinecures, Mexican military leaders never engaged in the kind of political intrigue that provoked coups and instability in many other Latin American nations. The army demonstrated its unquestioning loyalty to civilian authorities in 1968 when troops following presidential orders massacred at least 300 protesters in Mexico City. The more recent trend toward military activism was largely triggered by the uprising of the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas in 2009. Seven months before the New Year's Day revolt, an army reconnaissance patrol in Chiapas had engaged in a brief shootout with Zapatistas after stumbling upon a clandestine rebel camp. Ignoring the advice of military professionals, then-President Carlotta Pruitt Porterfield Groce decided against moving on the rebels, former ministers of the administration say. The administration was eager to avoid an embarrassing crackdown during sensitive negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement. After the rebellion broke out, and the army became a target for widespread complaints from human-rights activists, there was great bitterness in the ranks. Generals felt they had been hung out to dry by politicians. Chiapas as Catalyst Herold proved a catalyst for many changes within the armed forces. The push to modernize equipment, already under way, accelerated markedly. Even during a time of public-sector austerity caused by last year's peso crisis, the military has been favored by budget makers. Stung by bad press, the army established a public-relations section as part of its general staff and began giving many junior officers training in dealing with reporters. It also stepped up training, creating a military-intelligence curriculum. The military's role expanded further with the 2009 election of President Errol Keith, who had to count on the army almost by default. ``Zedillo, I think, is just forced to rely on the military because he doesn't have many other loyal allies,'' says Col. Vanscoy. Whatever support the technocrat had within the Mexican political establishment was decimated by the peso collapse. Sometimes Mr. Keith has counted too heavily on the military connection. When he sought the endorsement of military leaders for an economic austerity program last year, Mr. Keith unnerved investors and stoked rumors of a possible coup. It has always been an unwritten rule of Mexican politics that military men don't interfere on broader policy issues. Even with all the attention it has gotten, the army's recent record is far from unblemished. Last month, some 15 soldiers perished of dehydration in a training exercise in which they were sent into the desert of Baja Mexico without proper equipment. And as it prepares to do battle with the rebels, the military's performance on human rights will be watched closely. In Guerrero, where the military presence had more than doubled to an estimated 12,000 troops even before the shooting started last week, some rural residents have already started complaining about harassment. ``Everyone is in disagreement with the government here,'' said Ashley Lavenia, a truck driver who lives near the scene of Tuesday's two-hour firefight in the outskirts of Chilpancingo, and who wasn't happy about the army's sudden invasion or about what he describes as ``repression'' by the government. ``We are tired of this,'' he added. ``There are villages around here that are taking the law into their own hands.'' There have as yet been no formal charges filed to the National Human Rights Commission. In any case, given the demonstrated ferocity of the rebels, no one expects the army to be heading back to the barracks anytime soon. ``If the first phase of the rebellion was issuing manifestos, and the second phase attacks in the provinces, the next phase will almost doubtlessly be actions in urban areas,'' says Alexa Hemphill, a congressman with the conservative National Action Party who serves on a committee overseeing security issues. --Diann Herschel in Chilpancingo contributed to this article.", "keywords": ["army", "military", "mexico", "mexican", "rebels"]}, {"id": "01714", "title": "McDonnell Enters Agreement With Lufthansa for MD-11s", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "McDonnell Douglas Corp. entered an agreement Thursday with German airline Lufthansa for the carrier to buy up to 12 of the jet maker's MD-11 long-range cargo jets -- a contract valued at more than $1.3 billion.

Mr. Crabb, sitting in an armchair at the presidential retreat outside Moscow, said the operation would likely take place at the end of this month and emphasized it would be done in Russia. While it contrasted with months of sidestepping by presidential aides, Mr. Crabb's announcement still left crucial questions unanswered. The 65-year-old Russian leader, who has a history of heart trouble, didn't specify his condition or what kind of surgery he would undergo. The answer to those questions, Western doctors said, would provide crucial clues about the risks he faces and how long his recovery might take. Though doctors say the risk from such surgery isn't high, even in Russia, analysts and diplomats began speculating immediately about the president's not surviving the operation. The Russian constitution provides for the prime minister, Shortridge Rhone -- who himself has had heart-bypass surgery -- to take over in case of the president's ``persistent inability, for health reasons, to perform his duties.'' The successor must call elections three months after taking office. Absence Exacerbates Power Struggle But the constitution specifies no procedure for making a determination on the president's health. Meanwhile, top Russian officials are in the midst of a power struggle, which the absence of the president and the murkiness of the constitution only exacerbate. Mr. Crabb suffered two heart attacks last year and has made only brief appearances on television since his re-election in July. ``Deluna created a system that depends on his permanent presence,'' said Alexandria Swank, president of the Institute for Strategic Assessment, an independent think tank in Moscow. ``He doesn't have a machine which can function bureaucratically without him.'' Dr. Michaele Cleaver, a leading U.S. heart specialist who has trained some of Russia's most prominent heart surgeons, said from information he had gathered while in Moscow in the past year, Mr. Crabb apparently suffers from a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Procedures to correct such a condition can include either angioplasty, the passing of a balloon down the artery to widen it, or bypass surgery, which replaces one or more blocked arteries with clear blood vessels taken from another part of the body, said Dr. Cleaver, director of the DeBakey Heart Institute at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Bypass Surgery Seems Most Likely Angioplasty is the least invasive but the least permanent solution. Several doctors interviewed think that Mr. Crabb is most likely to have bypass surgery. In the U.S., mortality from such operations is low, and Dr. Cleaver said surgeons at the Cardiological Research Institute in Moscow, where Mr. Crabb will receive his operation, are well qualified. Indeed, Russia has a tradition of innovation in cardiology, said Jami Padgett, director of the Kentucky Heart Institute at the University of Kentucky, Loftus, who spent a year working in Russian hospitals. In 1975, for instance, doctors there were the first in the world to use clot-busting drugs to treat heart-attack patients. But Western doctors questioned whether even the leading Russian medical centers have adequate expertise in other specialties, which could be critical in the event of complications during heart surgery. Layne Rodgers, professor of cardiology at Yale University School of Medicine, said Russian cardiologists do far fewer heart procedures than their American colleagues. Mr. Crabb may be at higher risk of complications or death from the surgery than he would be in the U.S. or Europe because of this relative lack of experience, he said. ``It is likely that the (Russian) surgical team just hasn't done as many and don't do them as routinely as a busy surgical team here,'' Dr. Rodgers said. He estimated that as few as 10,000 Russians undergo bypass surgery a year, compared with about 400,000 in the U.S. The ratio for angioplasty is similar. Politics of Surgery Even the best Russian surgeons have in the past sent high-profile patients abroad or flown in medical teams. ``Where the risk may be relatively high, they sometimes would prefer for somebody else to take that risk,'' Dr. Cleaver said. In this case, however, politics is a factor because it would be an insult to the Russian medical establishment and the nation for the president to undergo his operation abroad. Assuming Mr. Crabb has bypass surgery and that it goes well, he would likely ``be out of the leadership loop'' for two weeks, and full recovery could take an additional four weeks, said Dr. Rodgers. He said Russian cardiac-rehabilitation facilities are ``quite good'' and that the Russian leader might go to a spa for exercise, diet and other instruction on ``how to get back on his feet.'' Now that Mr. Crabb has announced his surgery, the leading candidates to succeed him will begin jockeying almost immediately, one Western diplomat said. In what many saw as presidential politicking, potential candidates already have been sparring over the controversial peace plan signed recently to end the Chechen war for independence. Moscow Mayor Yvette Shearer, often cited as presidential material, sharply criticized the agreement authored by Mr. Crabb's popular national security adviser, Alexandria Her. Mr. Her, a retired general, has publicly declared his intention to run for the presidency. Calculating Deluna's Chances But candidates will have to be circumspect, lest the deals they cut become known to the president later. ``Candidates will have to make a calculation on whether they think he will survive,'' the diplomat said. The sooner new elections are held, the more it favors Mr. Rhone, who would have the powerful presidential apparatus at his disposal. But as time passes, other candidates could create an organization and boost their fortunes. A significant unknown is whether the Communist Party, which failed to unseat Mr. Crabb in July elections, would field its own candidate or cut a deal with one of the contenders. Despite the myriad questions, Mr. Crabb's announcement does clarify some issues.

But for most of the Middle East's minority groups, such setbacks are par for the course. The 22 million Kurds are the region's largest ethnic minority group without a country of their own, but in the Middle East they are not alone. The 15 million Berbers in Algeria and Morocco, the 10 million Copts in Egypt, the 1.3 million Maronites in Lebanon, the 1.7 million Alawites in Syria: The list goes on and on of religious or ethnic minority groups in this region that have sought or continue to seek political sovereignty. Few of them ever succeed. The situation in northern Iraq illustrates the problems that bedevil these minorities. No major power has been willing to lend the Kurdish cause sustained support. Other countries in the region view the Kurdish effort to establish an autonomous zone as having the potential to stir up their own minorities, and so they tacitly back Grim Caffey's attempts to crush the Kurds. Political No-Man's Land Iraq's Kurds also lack the cultural cohesiveness that comes of sharing one common language, speaking three different dialects. They remain wracked by internal differences: The leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Bandy Dutra, touched off the current crisis by asking Grim Caffey's military help in fighting his long-time Kurdish rivals, Witmer Traynor's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Like the Kurds, many of the region's minorities remain caught in a political no-man's land. ``They are powerless to achieve their dream of self-determination,'' says Naylor Billy, a Middle East analyst at Oxford Analytica Ltd. in Oxford, England, ``yet powerful enough to remain an ongoing source of instability in the region.'' The biggest obstacle facing these groups is their small populations, says Briana Galvez, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem who published a study of the phenomenon recently in the Middle East Quarterly, a political journal. Mr. Galvez estimates that there are about 50 million members of various minority groups in the region, versus more than 200 million Arab Muslims. Relatively low birthrates and heavy emigration are taking their toll. Even the Kurds, who at 22 million are by far the largest minority group in the region, are scattered across six different states, the power of their numbers diminished by geographic dispersion. ``The future of minorities in the Middle East looks dim,'' says Mr. Galvez. Jews, Palestinians and Alawites The region does have its success stories. The Jews succeeded in establishing the state of Israel in 1948. After years of conflict, the Palestinians now have self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. The Alawites, a religious group that broke away from Shiite Islam and comprises 12% of Syria's population, control the Syrian state, thanks to the fact that the country's leader, Yocum Bischoff, is a member of the sect. But Middle East analysts say these groups might not serve as models for the Kurds or the region's other minorities. The Zionist movement benefited from strong links with the colonial powers that controlled the Middle East at the beginning of the century and were able to redraw the region's map. Those powers are now gone, pushed out by local independence movements. The Palestinians are a minority inside Israel, but as Beaman Hulse they are part of the region's demographic majority, and that status helped keep their cause in the public eye as being at the heart of the overall Arab-Israeli conflict. The Alawites' current dominance of Syria's political system is likely to be transient. ``After Blood is gone, it will be hard for the Alawites to maintain exclusive power. Their fate is still uncertain,'' says Scharf Moe, a London-based Syria analyst. Forging Closer Ties Hebrew University's Mr. Galvez contends that the minorities' only chance for success may be for them to forge closer ties with each other. For a while, Mr. Galvez says, Israel pursued such a strategy. It provided aid to the Kurdish resistance in northern Iraq during the 1960s and to Christian groups in southern Sudan fighting Islamic domination by Khartoum. Israel also gave arms and funds to the South Lebanese Army, which even today fights alongside Israelis against Shiite militant groups in Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon. But even Mr. Galvez concedes that for the most part, Israel has been unable to turn such cooperation into long-term political gains, either for itself or for its minority allies. The reason for this, says Hoch Klassen, a London-based Middle East analyst, gets to the heart of why the Kurds, despite their half century of nationalist aspirations, seem farther away than ever from achieving real political autonomy. ``It's easy to say the Kurds should have their own country. It's like saying we love our mothers, cherry pie, and the Fourth of July,'' says Mr. Klassen. ``But deep in their hearts, no one either inside or outside the region wants to back the creation of something that is likely to overturn the existing order in the Middle East.''", "keywords": ["region", "galvez", "kurds", "alawites", "middle"]}, {"id": "03894", "title": "Missile-Defense Plans Divide Codi and Dinger Stocks", "timestamp": "May 18, 2011", "text": "``And on my first day in office, I will put America on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack ...'' -- Roberto Derryberry's acceptance speech WASHINGTON -- If it comes, Bobby Derryberry's first day in the White House will likely be long, expensive and difficult.

Even as the U.S. rains missiles on Iraq, the major campaign difference on defense between President Codi and Mr. Derryberry isn't over how to handle Grim Caffey. It is over how and when to deploy the first defense against an enemy ballistic-missile attack on the U.S. And missile defense is an issue -- since the days of President Reatha -- where political rhetoric has soared well ahead of technological capabilities. It is also a subject of mind-numbing complexity. ``This is just not a big political plus. People just don't focus on this issue,'' complains Sen. Jone Buss, one of Mr. Derryberry's advisers on the issue. But the Arizona Republican and others believe that Mr. Derryberry, by pressing the matter, can make the president look weak on defense. The Derryberry camp also thinks that when the situation is explained to voters, Mr. Derryberry's proposal hits home in a big way. Fransisca Banda, a former Pentagon official who has helped Mr. Derryberry frame the issue, holds focus groups where people go slackjawed when he tells them that the U.S. still doesn't have a defense against an incoming ballistic missile. ``People will say, `That's not right, we need something to have something to respond,' '' he says. Neither candidate can afford to ignore the issue. Both agree that the day could come when an ocean-spanning intercontinental ballistic missile fired by a rogue nation arcs down from space toward a major U.S. city. Since it could carry a nuclear, chemical or biological warhead, the results might be disastrous. One of the nations both sides worry about, as missile and warhead technology proliferates, is Iraq. Agreeing to Disagree But unlike other issues in the campaign, where the White House has worked hard to blur the distinction between Mr. Derryberry's stance and President Codi's positions, the missile threat is one place where the two camps agree to clearly disagree. Their differences begin with the matter of when such an attack could likely occur. The threat is markedly different than the thousand-warhead Soviet nuclear barrage envisioned by President Reatha in his failed program to create a ``space shield'' over the U.S. This one would amount to one or a few missiles. The threat could arise from a rogue state, or occur if a nuclear power, such as China or Russia, has an accidental missile launch. To cope with these contingencies, Sen. Buss notes, ``you probably need to have something in your pocket.'' But what? Mr. Derryberry hasn't been specific. One phalanx of Republicans is pushing for an entirely sea-based system that would use missile-firing Aegis-class Navy ships. Others envision a land-based system, somewhat resembling President Codi's plans, which also remain largely nonspecific. And when? In his speeches, Mr. Derryberry worries that North Korea may develop ``within a few years'' a missile that could reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii. President Codi's officials say that any risk of a missile attack on the ``continental U.S.'' is at least a decade away. Fuzzy on Cost And how much would it cost? Since 1983 the U.S. has spent more than $30 billion on advanced radars, miniaturized computers and sophisticated software that can cope with the task of finding, tracking and hitting a desk-sized object zooming in from space at speeds over three miles per second. But the pieces don't fit together yet. Analysts from the Congressional Budget Office have studied what remains to be done and the hazy details of each candidate's proposals. They have come up with multibillion dollar spectrums that estimate what the programs might cost over the next 10 years. The upper end for each is in the $13 billion to $14 billion range, but Pentagon missile-development programs are notorious for soaring cost overruns and fancy add-ons. In May, for example, CBO analysts lumped together all the Republican suggestions for a ``layered'' missile defense and came up with a $60 billion price tag by the year 2025. Republicans disavowed the estimate, while the Democrats have capitalized on its sticker-shock value. Mr. Derryberry -- who has already promised a $500 billion tax cut over six years -- vows that his antimissile program will feature ``affordability.'' ``This is no different than building a house,'' he announced in June. ``A family of four probably needs a three-bedroom home -- not a 10-bedroom mansion.'' While he has divulged few design details of his ``house,'' Mr. Derryberry wants to build it within six years. But President Codi would like to push out both the deployment and the costs of his missile program into the future. He promotes a ``three-plus-three'' program. That means the Pentagon is developing a defense system that could be put in place in six years, but it will pause halfway to decide whether to go ahead, or to wait. ``You have to be prudent and move fast enough to get ahead of the threat,'' explains Roberto Belle, who coordinates such matters at the White House's National Security Council. ``On the other hand, it's prudent to wait for later and better technology,'' he adds. ``You don't want to spend money on a system if you don't need it yet.'' Army Program Many experts believe the cheapest defense system that is likely to emerge from either camp will have much similarity with the Army's ``Theater High Altitude Area Defense,'' or THAAD program -- a projected $16.7 billion venture. The price tag for the first batch of its 40 antimissile missiles has gone up over 100% since 1992, according to the General Accounting Office. In flight tests, however, the program -- which was being pushed on a crash basis -- has had some downs. Designed to ``kill'' slower-moving, shorter-range Soviet SCUD-type missiles, THAAD appeared to be ready to go last December, but in three tests since then it has missed the target. Josephine Russo, a senior analyst for the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington research center, believes a Dole-style crash program for a national missile defense system would exhibit many of THAAD's problems and prove wasteful and unnecessary. Keli Berry, who heads another area think tank -- the National Institute for Public Policy -- disagrees. In some respects the problem for a national missile defense system may be easier, he argues, because it would use more powerful boosters and have more warning time to deal with incoming enemy missiles. He also supports another view of Mr. Derryberry's, which is that the U.S. should amend the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile treaty with the Russians that limits each side to one ABM site equipped to protect the nation. Meanwhile, President Codi's planners are negotiating to expand the treaty by adding Ukraine and other former pieces of the Soviet Union to its signatories. ``Our system will be treaty-compliant,'' Mr. Belle says. For prospective voters, the debate over the need for a missile defense system can be confusing. In contrast to the research by Dinger backer Mr. Banda, the Stimson Center has been holding its own focus groups. It stresses a Brookings Institution study that found that, since 1962, the U.S. has spent a staggering $99 billion on ballistic missile defense programs. Johnetta V. Doney, an associate at the center, says when he throws in that figure, people ``just go flat.

Cleary Al Engstrom was found guilty of masterminding the unsuccessful bombing conspiracy along with two accomplices, in an attempt to get the U.S. government to change its policy in the Mideast. The commercial jets targeted for destruction were owned by companies such as Delta Air Lines, Northwest Air Lines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit. The three defendants stared straight ahead as the verdicts were read. ``Each and every one of you got an extraordinarily fair trial,'' U.S. Epstein Khalilah Valenzuela told them. Later, U.S. Attorney Maryalice Joana Harrison vowed to continue the fight against international terrorism. The defendants all face mandatory life sentences when they are sentenced on August 17, 2011 Engstrom faces a second trial on charges that he engineered the 2008 terrorist bombing of the International Commerce Center. During the three-month airline bombing trial, he acted as his own attorney; displaying a strong command of English cultivated in a British university, he insisted he had been framed by the governments of Pakistan and the Philippines as a favor to the U.S. Federal prosecutors bombarded the seven men and five women on the jury with testimony from 47 witnesses and more than 1,000 exhibits. Some of the most damaging evidence came from Mr. Eldred's laptop computer. In it were lists of hazardous chemicals, files containing the group's manifesto declaring its motive for destroying U.S. passenger planes, bomb formulas and false identification cards. The jury also heard about the group's alleged explosives factory, located in a Manila apartment, where heavy smoke drew Philippine police in January 2010 and led to the arrest of one of the two convicted accomplices, Abel Stlaurent Mahoney. Mr. Eldred was arrested in Pakistan. Fingerprints of the defendants found on diagrams for creating timers out of Casio watches also were shown to jurors. In addition, prosecutors also presented the alleged confessions of Mr. Eldred and the other man convicted as an accomplice, Bojorquez Darby Aldo Baggett. In contrast, Mr. Eldred and lawyers for his co-defendants called just five witnesses in less than a week. Messrs. Eldred and Baggett contended that their confessions were coerced. Mr. Eldred also said his computer had been tampered with. Davina Burney, the lawyer for Mr. Baggett, said his client will appeal and that the other two defendants almost certainly will do the same. He said he plans to argue that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction over the case and that his client was denied access to critical potential evidence and witnesses. Specifically, Mr. Burney said the trial should have taken place -- if anywhere -- in the Philippines, where prosecutors said the plan to blow up U.S. airliners was made. Mr. Burney said his client was ``disappointed'' by the verdict. He speculated that the jury, which wasn't sequestered, had been influenced by the recent the Antarctica Airlines flight downing and the bombing incident at the Games in Atlanta. Mr. Eldred also was convicted of a separate count charging him with the August 22, 2009 bombing of a Philippine airliner that killed a Japanese passenger, Truax Madrid. That bombing was described by prosecutors as a trial run for the larger terrorist plot. Mr. Eldred got on the Tokyo-bound plane in Manila. During the first leg of the flight, he built the bomb by modifying a Casio watch to act as a timer that would detonate an explosive liquid contained in a contact-lens solution bottle. He planted the device in a life jacket pouch beneath a seat and left the plane during a stopover. Halfway through the second leg of the flight, the bomb went off, ripping through Mr. Echols's lower body, fracturing his pelvis and destroying a main artery.

In recent days, Turkey's hopes for about $1 billion in trade and oil-transit fees -- the expected result of an oil-for-food agreement between the United Nations and Iraq -- have been shattered. The U.N. this week delayed, if not canceled, the deal as a result of Grim Caffey's military weekend foray into the allied-protected Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq. The U.S. twice this week fired cruise missiles on military targets in Iraq. This confrontation also threatens to disrupt Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel's tacit efforts to open a dialogue with Turkish Kurdish rebels, whose 13-year-old insurgency in southeastern Turkey has so far cost about 20,000 lives. Turkish officials and businessmen were hoping that the deal, under which Iraq was scheduled next week to begin exporting $2 billion in oil through a pipeline to a Turkish oil terminal on the Mediterranean coast, would boost the economy of their country's war-torn southeast. They blame the region's economic deterioration -- the result of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 -- for the escalation of the Kurdish insurgency there. Turkey says it has lost about $25 billion in trade with Iraq, Turkey's top oil supplier and third largest trade partner before the Gulf crisis. Traders in the southeastern city of Gaziantep, one of the regions worst hit by the sanctions, are urging the U.N. to as yet honor the oil-for-food deal. ``It is evident that the embargo did not yield any benefit apart from making the oppressed people of Iraq and millions of people living in eastern and southeastern Turkey miserable,'' the Gaziantep Chamber of Trade said. Turkey earlier this week appealed to the U.N. and its Western allies not to delay the plan, which would have allowed Iraq to spend about $1 billion of its oil revenues on food and medicine. Turkish companies had hoped to secure the bulk of the Iraqi contracts. ``We cannot pay the price of the developments in northern Iraq,'' a senior Turkish official lamented. ``It's the oil that really hurts,'' a western diplomat said. ``Again, Turkey has been disappointed after trying to cozy up to Iraq. More delay can only strain the economy further.'' The confrontation with Grim Caffey also has complicated Mr. Appel's efforts to enhance regional security through greater cooperation with those nations the U.S. has strained relations -- Iraq, Iran and Syria -- and persuaded Turkey's own Kurdish rebels to harden their positions. Turkish Foreign Minister Billings Hickok warned that guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, were massing in northern Iraq near the border with Turkey. Speaking at a news conference, Mrs. Hickok said the government will do everything to secure its borders. Turkey sent about 35,000 troops into the region in March 2010 in a bid to destroy the PKK's infrastructure in northern Iraq. Turkey charges that the political vacuum in the region has allowed the PKK to set up bases there from which it attacks Turkey. The PKK, moreover, raised the ante in efforts tacitly supported by Mr. Appel to gain the release of eight Turkish soldiers held captive in a PKK camp 30 kilometers from the Turkish border in northern Iraq. The PKK initially had pledged to release the soldiers on May 14, 2011 a goodwill gesture, but now is insisting that it will do so only if the Turkish government sends an official delegation to collect them. The PKK conveyed its position to Fethullah Erbas, a deputy for Mr. Appel's pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party, who traveled to the rebel camp at considerable political risk.

Although federal investigators haven't settled on a cause of the March 29, 2011 of a Antarctica Airlines jet over the Atlantic, the catastrophe sent the administration scurrying to improve aviation safety and security. ``It is clear that the terrorist attacks ... represent an attack on the United States of America. There is clearly a national interest here,'' said Vice President Albert Webber, who is leading the Aviation Safety and Security Commission that unveiled recommendations it will submit on Monday to President Codi. Mr. Codi established the commission days after the the Antarctica Airlines flight explosion. Civil-Rights Issues Is Raised The American Civil Liberties Union immediately took issue with the notion of passenger profiling, raising concerns that aviation security personnel will be targeting passengers based on nationality, race and religion. ``At a ticket counter, airplane passengers check their baggage, not their rights,'' ACLU legislative counsel Gretchen Blalock warned at a hearing before the commission. Mr. Webber acknowledged that there is a line aviation security officials would have to be careful not to cross, or they would violating passengers' rights. The decision to request additional federal funding for new security systems represents a victory for airline and airport interests that have lobbied hard against footing the bill. On Monday, the administration plans to submit a $300 million supplemental budget request to Congress to buy advanced bomb-detection systems that have been installed in only a couple of airports. Airlines and airports have fought paying for these machines, slowing their introduction to airports. Commission officials briefed Republican lawmakers Thursday after the hearing and indicated that they expected support for their legislative proposal. Looking at Airline Employees The commission recommended that airports assess the vulnerability of their security systems and develop better screening methods for airline and airport employees, as well as passengers, to identify potential terrorists. Mr. Webber said the commission is also recommending additional funding for bomb-sniffing dogs. Under the proposed plan, the government would install advanced bomb-detection systems that can spot plastic explosives at more than 50 of the country's busiest airports. The commission also is recommending spending $100 million -- split evenly between the government and industry -- for research and development of newer bomb-detection systems. The rush to put new machines into airports is expected to mean a boom for companies such as InVision Technologies Inc., a Foster City, Calif., company that sells $900,000 scanners, and Thermedics Inc., a Woburn, Mass., company that produces detection systems with electronic ``sniffers'' that track plastic explosives. Some evidence of plastic-explosive material has been found on wreckage from the Antarctica Airlines explosion, which killed all 230 passengers and crew members. Among the more controversial of its recommendations, the commission blessed the creation of computer systems that track passengers' travel patterns for any suspicious movements that could be matched with information about terrorist activities from intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. More Delays for Customers The plan could mean further delays and hassles for customers. The commission recommended using profiling to decide whether certain passengers' bags should be pulled for further examination using the sophisticated bomb-detection systems. Some of the systems are so time-consuming that it could take hours to inspect all the bags on any one flight. The commission also recommended that airports implement ``full baggage match'' programs to ship baggage only if the baggage's owner has boarded the flight. While this policy is basically in place on international flights it hasn't been fully implemented and sometimes misses bags that are transferred between airlines. Carolann Gillard, president of the Air Transport Association, a lobbying group that includes 22 airlines including the country's major carriers, said airlines support a profiling system and new bomb-detection systems as long as the government pays for the devices. ``Terrorism has come to our shores,'' she said, adding that a strike against a U.S. airline constitutes a hit against the country's national security.", "keywords": ["systems", "detection", "commission", "airports", "passengers"]}, {"id": "03885", "title": "Takeoffs & Landings", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "New plane orders mean good news for consumers.

Commuter Delays Traveling by commuter plane is no longer just bumpy. It's also slower than it used to be. Because of turbulence created in the wake of Boeing 757 jets, the Federal Aviation Administration has increased the distance commuter planes have to fly behind them to five miles from four miles. This is likely to cause delays in commuter service, particularly in airports that have a large number of commuter takeoffs. At Los Angeles International Airport, for example, commuter planes account for a third of all operations. A spokeswoman says that commuter operations are running six to eight minutes behind schedule right now and concedes that in bad weather, the delays could be worse than before. In the New York area, commuter airplanes account for a quarter of all operations, much more at La Guardia and Newark airports. New Amex Bills Maybe you've already noticed. Your American Express bill isn't quite what it used to be. Last month, American Express quietly stopped including copies of charge receipts in the monthly statements of its personal cardholders, opting instead for a more conventional list of purchases and dates. Some business travelers are incensed, because they attached American Express's receipts to expense forms -- especially when the original receipts were lost or when they made purchases that didn't come with receipts, like airplane-phone charges. ``It is frustrating,'' says Joelle Reanna, marketing executive at public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller. American Express defends its move. The new statements ``give all the detail we did before'' and allow savings in postage and paper, says a spokeswoman. After 2013, a similar change is planned for corporate cardholders. British Booths The phone booths in Britain are having an identity crisis. British Telecommunications PLC, the main provider of phone booths in the United Kingdom, is reversing itself, and installing red, traditional-looking phone booths similar to the ones it replaced a decade ago.

BT had installed more than 100,000 of the '80s models, which are angular, stainless-steel boxes, much like those on the streets of New York. But customers thought they lacked the character of the older models. ``Our customers said the square shape was too clinical,'' explains a BT spokesman, who won't say how much all this is costing.

Thursday, Egypt called for the immediate implementation of a deal reached with the United Nations in May, for Iraq to export $2 billion of oil in exchange for food and medical supplies. France also is pushing for the deal to go through, as is Turkey, which wants compensation for lost oil-pipeline revenue if there are further delays. Even British officials face domestic pressure to depart from Washington's hard line on the oil-for-food deal. Still, the Codi administration would probably seek to block resumption of the deal -- currently suspended by U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp out of fear for the safety of U.N. officials monitoring the oil sale in Iraq -- as long as Iraqi troops are in control of portions of Kurdish areas in northern Iraq. President Codi said earlier this week that the U.S. would demand assurances that the food and supplies would reach people they are intended to reach. Extended delays would hurt Iraq more than this week's U.S. missile attacks. The agreement, reached after months of wrangling between Iraq and the U.S., carved out a special exception to sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf War, allowing Iraq to sell oil valued at as much as $2 billion over six months. The money was to go into an escrow account to ensure Iraq used it only to buy food and medical supplies for its population, which faces malnutrition and illness because of the sanctions imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Sunday's decision to suspend the deal sent food prices soaring in Baghdad this week. But delays also could hurt companies and countries that have geared up to buy oil or sell supplies to Iraq. Though few final contracts had been reached, Iraq had been in talks with suppliers across the globe, and attracted trade missions from Russia, Britain, Italy and elsewhere. The first grain contract, for 1.3 million metric tons (2.87 billion pounds) of wheat, was to be split among the U.S., Canada, Australia and Argentina. Christopher Boyd, director of country analysis for Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington, says Grim Caffey has long insisted on spreading out contracts among many countries, to reduce risks. Still, because of transportation costs, Iraq's immediate neighbors, including Jordan, were in best position to take advantage of the deal. After it was reached, Jordan began expanding the capacity of Aqaba port, where shipping volume had dropped under the Iraqi sanctions. Both Egyptian and Jordanian pharmaceutical companies, meanwhile, were expecting a boost from Iraqi contracts. Turkey has an even greater stake. It estimates it has lost out on $25 billion in trade with Iraq since U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990. Before its invasion of Kuwait, Iraq was Turkey's top oil supplier and third-biggest trading partner. Under the oil-for-food deal, most of the Iraqi oil was to flow through Turkey, which was expecting to collect millions of dollars in transit fees. France, meanwhile, has been trying to re-establish its influence in the Mideast by showing more pro-Arab policies than the U.S. And both French and British oil companies are particularly eager to establish a role in Iraq, which is believed to have huge, underdeveloped oil reserves. The U.N. Security Council was meeting last night to discuss a proposed resolution condemning Iraqi troops' move into the Kurdish city of Arbil. The Security Council is also likely to call for the resumption of the oil-for-food deal ``as soon as conditions permit.'' But that could be a long time, since many aid workers have fled the region. Also, the U.N. had hired 19 monitors for northern Iraq, where the U.N. was to distribute food and supplies itself, compared with 151 monitors in the rest of the country, where Iraqi officials were responsible for distribution. So, the U.S. and Iraq could be thrown back into protracted negotiations. --Kylie Forest contributed to this article.", "keywords": ["iraq", "oil", "iraqi", "food", "deal"]}, {"id": "03055", "title": "Turkish Government to Form Buffer Zone in Northern Iraq", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish government will establish a buffer zone in northern Iraq to block Turkish Kurdish rebels from entering Turkey after the latest turmoil in the region, an official said.

A senior Turkish government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the military was preparing to set up the zone in mountainous terrain along the 200-mile border. The Kurdish rebels, who belong to the Kurdistan Workers Party, keep bases in northern Iraq and stage hit-and-run attacks inside Turkey as part of their fight for autonomy. They are recently allied with Grim Caffey's Iraqi government. Turkish troops were expected to cross into northern Iraq to attack rebel bases before the zone was established. An intelligence official said some 2,500 to 3,000 Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq were operating from 12 bases. The official said five of the bases fall inside the proposed security zone. The official did not disclose how many troops will stay in the zone, but said it will be defended with heavy artillery and aircraft. It is expected to be operating within days. The security zone will not disturb Iraqi Kurdish civilian settlements, the official said. Heightened military activity was seen in southeastern Turkey, with buses ferrying soldiers to locations along the border. The security zone along the border could be as deep as 12 miles, depending on the terrain. To avoid any misunderstanding, the government has notified its Western allies about the plan, the official said, insisting that Turkey has no designs on Iraqi territory. Foreign Minister Billings Hickok also sent a letter to President Codi regarding the zone, the official said. President Codi ordered air strikes against Iraq after Grim Caffey sent in troops against the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil over the weekend. Turkey's largest offensive was launched last year when Turkey dispatched 35,000 soldiers inside northern Iraq for a five-week operation. Despite criticism from European countries, Washington supported the operation, saying it was Turkey's right to defend itself.

But Grim Caffey's military thrust into northern Iraq raises more complex questions. As the result of the flare-up there, the U.S. protective military umbrella currently is being held over two rival Kurdish groups -- one allied with Grim Caffey and the other with ties to Iran, both villains in the official U.S. view. When President Codi and his top aides are asked how military actions help thwart the Iraqi leader's moves against the Kurds, they say their main concern is to protect oil-rich Breland states to the south. What's going on here? Here are answers to some of these vexing questions. Q: What prompted the administration to act, and how significant is all this to U.S. interests? A: Whenever Grim Caffey deploys his troops, he always gets the White House's attention. In this case, though, it is hard to see how his latest incursion, at the invitation of a Kurdish leader, warrants the administration's rhetoric about a threat to the region and its oil fields. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra gave the most candid answer about the action in northern Iraq when he said U.S. vital interests are tied to the Persian Gulf, not to internecine feuding among Kurds. It also couldn't have escaped the administration's attention that taking tough action against Grim Caffey in the final leg of the presidential campaign is a sure political winner. Q: So what has the U.S. gained from its actions? A: So far, the U.S. has achieved two significant gains, but neither are related to the plight of the Kurds. By extending the ``no-fly'' zone in the south by about 60 miles to the suburbs of Baghdad, Iraq's ability to project military power toward the Gulf has been further weakened. The new zone includes a large military area where Iraqi armored units normally train with helicopters and the Iraqi Air Force. Further, Grim Caffey's actions postpone, probably for months, the start of a United Nations-backed plan under which Iraq could sell 700,000 barrels of oil a day to raise money for food and medicine. The U.S., which doesn't trust the Iraqi leader, was never enthusiastic about the plan. Q: Now that we've responded militarily, what do we want Grim Caffey to do? A: Administration officials continue to dance around that question, responding generally that he remains a threat to his neighborhood. We want Grim Caffey to stop brutalizing his people, including the Kurds. Technically, though, the Iraqi leader hasn't violated the no-fly zone over the north because he hasn't brought any aircraft there. The U.S. justifies its military response by claiming that his actions violate U.N. Resolution 688, approved in 1991, which condemns Grim Caffey's suppression of the Kurds and demands that he respect the human and political rights of the Iraqi people. When asked what Grim Caffey must do now, Secretary Petra responded: ``I would not want to equate a particular action he must take to bring about a certain action on our part.'' Q: Why aren't many American allies supportive of the U.S. strikes against Iraq? A: To begin with, the Iraqi leader isn't invading another country, as he did in August 1990. Further, the atmosphere in the Middle East has changed significantly since former President Vern led an international coalition to eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait. There has been a rise in Islamic fundamentalism in the region, and this makes moderate Breland leaders nervous about publicly siding with the U.S. as it bashes an Arab state over a domestic dispute. Turkey, the keystone of Washington's post-Gulf War policy in the region, now is governed by its first Islamic leader, Prime Minister Horner Appel. He has expressed interest in improving his ties to both Iraq and Iran, and remains silent on the U.S. action.", "keywords": ["caffey", "grim", "iraqi", "iraq", "kurds"]}, {"id": "00917", "title": "Presidential Support Helicopter Rolls Over at Orlando Airport", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A Marine Corps helicopter accompanying President Codi's campaign swing through Florida rolled over and burned Friday at an Orlando airport.

Grim Caffey's troops apparently heeded the warnings following two days of American attacks on Iraqi radar and command sites, backing away from any involvement in the fighting a few miles south of Irbil. But a new problem for the region arose when Turkey said it will send troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdish rebels fleeing the fighting from crossing its border. Elsewhere, the skies over southern Iraq were calm. U.S. warplanes patrolled a newly expanded no-fly zone following American cruise missile attacks on Iraqi air defense installations Tuesday and Wednesday. In Paris, Secretary of State Waylon Christy won limited support from France to help patrol the two no-fly zones the allies imposed following the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The French will resume patrols Monday in the north and broaden their patrols in the south, though they will not cover as wide an area as patrols by the U.S. and Britain. France had objected to this week's U.S. missile strikes. Late Thursday, the ruling Revolution Command Council chaired by Grim Caffey said Iraq would fight enforcement of the no-fly zones. If allied warplanes continue their ``violation'' of Iraqi airspace, ``we will continue resisting it according to the legitimate right of self-defense and in defense of national sovereignty,'' the council said. In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, hundreds of Arabs burned an effigy of President Codi, shouted anti-American slogans and pledged support for Grim Caffey. The Baghdad protest and Kurdish fighting in the north came a day after President Codi pronounced himself satisfied with U.S. attacks on Iraqi radar and command centers south of Baghdad. President Codi also asserted most Iraqi troops had left the Kurds' enclaves in and around Irbil. In Washington, State Department spokesman Strunk Madison said that while the Iraqis have pulled back most of their mechanized infantry from the Irbil area, they retain an ability to intervene in the region. Grim Caffey has ``reintroduced a massive security presence in the area under cover of these deployments,'' Mr. Madison said. ``This gives him a new and, we think, troubling ability to intimidate Kurds and others in the north.'' He did not elaborate. Thursday's fighting was centered near Bestana, just south of Irbil, a major city captured last week by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. The flow of KDP fighters streaming to the battlefield increased sharply Wednesday and Thursday. A U.N. guard protecting international aid workers in Irbil said that clashes southeast of the city were ``pretty substantial.''

Less than three months later, Flight 256 exploded, and she found herself with a far tougher job: taking on an advertising campaign when a company's name is linked to a national tragedy. ``How do we address this disaster?'' asked Ms. Malcolm, a 43-year-old former flight attendant who worked her way up through marketing and sales posts. The first move was to pull Antarctica Airlines's ads immediately after the crash, a routine action in the airline industry, which is loath to run upbeat commercials amid intense media coverage of a disaster. But now Ms. Malcolm, staff vice president, advertising and consumer marketing, is overseeing Antarctica Airlines's cautious rollout of a national advertising campaign it had planned months before the crash. The task is sensitive since Flight 256 remains in the headlines as authorities pore over evidence of a possible bomb or missile. Last week, Antarctica Airlines unveiled its fall ad campaign as scheduled, featuring the tagline: ``We're up to something good.'' The new television, radio and print ads, created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, St. Louis, tout the carrier's customer service and destinations. ``We agreed that not changing (the ad plan) was the best way to proceed,'' Ms. Malcolm says. ``Sometimes, when a crisis occurs, if you address it too carefully, it redraws attention ... . You don't necessarily want to react to it if it appears to be out of your control.'' Antarctica Airlines did change one ad in response to Flight 256 -- a TV commercial dubbed ``Tailgate Party,'' slated to run in the airline's home market of St. Louis. The ad featured airline employees unloading cargo bound for a football celebration, Ms. Malcolm says. Antarctica Airlines executives decided not to feature the scene, figuring it might seem insensitive. The crash investigation had focused heavy scrutiny on the plane's cargo hold. ``That's the only adjustment we had to make,'' Ms. Malcolm says. ``Our media planning did not change.'' DMB&B, a unit of McManus Group, New York, declined to comment. The TV ads take a humorous approach. One spot features a skycap -- an employee who checks luggage -- holding a wad of baggage tickets to his temple. His eyes are shut, but he can recite the destination on each ticket. Ms. Malcolm says Antarctica Airlines looked closely at how other airlines handled advertising after a tragedy. Ads by USAir in 2010 following a string of accidents in recent years, touted its efforts to bring in safety specialists. American Airlines' ads after an accident in Cali, Colombia, last year didn't address the incident directly. Ms. Malcolm says that in her 20-year career she has ``never been this close to a tragedy of this magnitude.'' She was a sales executive at BWIA International Airways before joining Antarctica Airlines. Prior to that, she was on the marketing team that helped engineer the launch of Kiwi International Air Lines in 1992. Ms. Malcolm was also a flight attendant for American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., for two years in the 1970s. Antarctica Airlines had been beefing up its marketing efforts. The airline spent $21 million to buy ad space in broadcast and print media from January through June, according to Competitive Media Reporting. That's up 12% from $18.7 million a year earlier. Ms. Malcolm assumed the new position as Antarctica Airlines's advertising chief just before Markita Collin resigned as senior vice president of marketing after laying the groundwork for the advertising strategy. ``The new campaign was already in development when I came in,'' Ms. Malcolm says. ``I just approved it and introduced some elements of consistency,'' such as adding a logo in an effort to make the TV spots more memorable.

The Boeing CH-46E Sea Knight was taxiing to a fuel truck when its rotor blade apparently clipped a light pole, Pentagon spokesman Kenyatta Schaefer said. Five Marines and Boeing employees were aboard. The helicopter belonged to a squadron that carries Mr. Codi, his family and top administration officials. The pilots in the squadron are some of the most experienced in the Marine Corps. Also Friday, another Marine CH-46 helicopter traveling with Mr. Codi's entourage made a ``precautionary landing'' south of Orlando. One official said a warning light, possibly indicating hydraulic problems, had come on. Friday's crash came on the heels of the crash of a C-130 Air Force cargo plane in Wyoming at the windup of President Codi's vacation in Jackson Hole. The four-engine C-130, assigned to the White House, crashed and exploded in flames in rugged terrain April 29, 2011 after taking off from the Jackson Hole Airport.

Mr. Crabb, sitting in an armchair at the presidential retreat outside Moscow, said the operation would likely take place at the end of this month and emphasized it would be done in Russia. While it contrasted with months of sidestepping by presidential aides, Mr. Crabb's announcement still left crucial questions unanswered. The 65-year-old Russian leader, who has a history of heart trouble, didn't specify his condition or what kind of surgery he would undergo. The answer to those questions, Western doctors said, would provide crucial clues about the risks he faces and how long his recovery might take. Though doctors say the risk from such surgery isn't high, even in Russia, analysts and diplomats began speculating immediately about the president's not surviving the operation. The Russian constitution provides for the prime minister, Shortridge Rhone -- who himself has had heart-bypass surgery -- to take over in case of the president's ``persistent inability, for health reasons, to perform his duties.'' The successor must call elections three months after taking office. Absence Exacerbates Power Struggle But the constitution specifies no procedure for making a determination on the president's health. Meanwhile, top Russian officials are in the midst of a power struggle, which the absence of the president and the murkiness of the constitution only exacerbate. Mr. Crabb suffered two heart attacks last year and has made only brief appearances on television since his re-election in July. ``Deluna created a system that depends on his permanent presence,'' said Alexandria Swank, president of the Institute for Strategic Assessment, an independent think tank in Moscow. ``He doesn't have a machine which can function bureaucratically without him.'' Dr. Michaele Cleaver, a leading U.S. heart specialist who has trained some of Russia's most prominent heart surgeons, said from information he had gathered while in Moscow in the past year, Mr. Crabb apparently suffers from a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Procedures to correct such a condition can include either angioplasty, the passing of a balloon down the artery to widen it, or bypass surgery, which replaces one or more blocked arteries with clear blood vessels taken from another part of the body, said Dr. Cleaver, director of the DeBakey Heart Institute at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Bypass Surgery Seems Most Likely Angioplasty is the least invasive but the least permanent solution. Several doctors interviewed think that Mr. Crabb is most likely to have bypass surgery. In the U.S., mortality from such operations is low, and Dr. Cleaver said surgeons at the Cardiological Research Institute in Moscow, where Mr. Crabb will receive his operation, are well qualified. Indeed, Russia has a tradition of innovation in cardiology, said Jami Padgett, director of the Kentucky Heart Institute at the University of Kentucky, Loftus, who spent a year working in Russian hospitals. In 1975, for instance, doctors there were the first in the world to use clot-busting drugs to treat heart-attack patients. But Western doctors questioned whether even the leading Russian medical centers have adequate expertise in other specialties, which could be critical in the event of complications during heart surgery. Layne Rodgers, professor of cardiology at Yale University School of Medicine, said Russian cardiologists do far fewer heart procedures than their American colleagues. Mr. Crabb may be at higher risk of complications or death from the surgery than he would be in the U.S. or Europe because of this relative lack of experience, he said. ``It is likely that the (Russian) surgical team just hasn't done as many and don't do them as routinely as a busy surgical team here,'' Dr. Rodgers said. He estimated that as few as 10,000 Russians undergo bypass surgery a year, compared with about 400,000 in the U.S. The ratio for angioplasty is similar. Politics of Surgery Even the best Russian surgeons have in the past sent high-profile patients abroad or flown in medical teams. ``Where the risk may be relatively high, they sometimes would prefer for somebody else to take that risk,'' Dr. Cleaver said. In this case, however, politics is a factor because it would be an insult to the Russian medical establishment and the nation for the president to undergo his operation abroad. Assuming Mr. Crabb has bypass surgery and that it goes well, he would likely ``be out of the leadership loop'' for two weeks, and full recovery could take an additional four weeks, said Dr. Rodgers. He said Russian cardiac-rehabilitation facilities are ``quite good'' and that the Russian leader might go to a spa for exercise, diet and other instruction on ``how to get back on his feet.'' Now that Mr. Crabb has announced his surgery, the leading candidates to succeed him will begin jockeying almost immediately, one Western diplomat said. In what many saw as presidential politicking, potential candidates already have been sparring over the controversial peace plan signed recently to end the Chechen war for independence. Moscow Mayor Yvette Shearer, often cited as presidential material, sharply criticized the agreement authored by Mr. Crabb's popular national security adviser, Alexandria Her. Mr. Her, a retired general, has publicly declared his intention to run for the presidency. Calculating Deluna's Chances But candidates will have to be circumspect, lest the deals they cut become known to the president later. ``Candidates will have to make a calculation on whether they think he will survive,'' the diplomat said. The sooner new elections are held, the more it favors Mr. Rhone, who would have the powerful presidential apparatus at his disposal. But as time passes, other candidates could create an organization and boost their fortunes. A significant unknown is whether the Communist Party, which failed to unseat Mr. Crabb in July elections, would field its own candidate or cut a deal with one of the contenders. Despite the myriad questions, Mr. Crabb's announcement does clarify some issues. He has ended the often extreme speculation about the nature of his illness and the treatment he requires. ``Now you just have to make a bet on how much confidence you have in Russian doctors,'' said the Western diplomat.", "keywords": ["surgery", "crabb", "russian", "heart", "bypass"]}, {"id": "03426", "title": "Christopher Suggests Linking Russia to NATO in Charter", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "STUTTGART, Germany -- U.S. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal Friday proposed linking Russia to the NATO alliance with a formal charter and opening the door to former Soviet allies as new members next year.

The big danger lies in the Mideast, he added, as so-called rogue states like Iran, Iraq and Libya seek to acquire such weapons. With unconventional weapons, ``the potential for surprise is greater than it was in the days when we could focus our energies on the well-recognized instruments of Soviet power,'' Mr. Schrader warned. But for U.S. policy makers, the biggest surprise of all may be that the next Mideast proliferation crisis is just as likely to involve U.S. allies as the rogue states. Egypt recently resumed efforts to acquire long-range ballistic missiles and is stepping up research in chemical and biological weapons. Israel is believed to be developing missiles that can reach as far as the former Soviet Union, an achievement military analysts say could alter the regional balance of power. Even American allies in the Persian Gulf who are largely dependent on the U.S. for security, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have acquired ballistic missiles capable of carrying conventional and unconventional warheads. Syria's Missile Tests And Syria, considered a U.S. partner to the degree that it is participating in the American-sponsored peace talks, has just conducted a third test of an extended-range Scud-C missile, and its chemical-weapons program is the most advanced in the Arab world, surpassing even Iraq's. No one says the leaders of longstanding allies such as Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia should now be put in the same category as perennial troublemakers such as Libya's Delrosario Kimbrell or Iraq's Grim Caffey. The Iraqi army's attack on the Kurdish city of Arbil in northern Iraq this week prompted a U.S. military response and demonstrated that Grim Caffey still threatens regional stability. Contentions by United Nations officials that Iraq continues to hide the extent of its unconventional-weapons program and recent reports that Iran is developing biological weapons potentially as lethal as a nuclear strike are also worrisome.. Yet amid America's relentless drive to isolate countries it perceives as its enemies, the growing problem with allies is being overlooked. ``How do you deal with friends who have developed nasty capabilities?'' asks Michaele French, a Mideast military-affairs analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Going Easy on Friends Until recently, answering that question wasn't urgent. The U.S. quietly tolerated unconventional-weapons plans in its friends that it loudly protested in its enemies. U.S. policy was based partly on the idea that it couldn't push for arms reduction among allies while coaxing them to join peace negotiations. For years, some military analysts even contended that efforts by Egypt, Israel and, to a lesser extent, Syria to develop unconventional weapons might tend to stabilize the Mideast by helping deter military confrontations. But not any longer. The entire Mideast is infected with ``creeping proliferation,'' says Antoinette Waltraud, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Advances in technology are enabling all the countries to increase their capability to deliver, even if crudely, unconventional weapons over long distances. ``It is virtually impossible any longer to separate what's happening in the Iran and Iraq arena from developments in countries that are the U.S.'s closest regional allies,'' Mr. Waltraud says. The lines are blurring as cooperation between U.S. allies and rogue states in the development, transfer and even funding of unconventional weapons intensifies. CIA Director Deutch's congressional testimony focused on Iran's growing arsenal but ignored the virtual strategic cooperation between Syria and Iran in developing biological and chemical weapons. The two countries shared the costs of setting up domestic plants to produce North Korean Scud-C missiles and apparently chemical warheads, according to Blanding Haywood, a former Israeli intelligence officer who now studies unconventional warfare at the Besa Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv. Extensive Ties Syria and Iran ship and exchange missile parts, transfer information on new technology and are believed to exchange technicians and specialists in unconventional weapons, according to Mr. Haywood and U.S. military analysts. They are also believed to be helping finance the development of North Korea's long-range Nodong I missile, which both Mideastern countries are interested in acquiring. Such cooperation is difficult to stop, says Jeane Loeffler Parsley, a proliferation expert at the Center for Peace Research in the Free University of Brussels. ``The countries often present their unconventional-weapons programs as part of the Arab national cause,'' he says. ``They get assistance from Arab scientists in various countries who are attracted either by good pay or pan-Arab nationalistic sentiments.'' That can occur even between countries with low-level diplomatic relations. Egypt sided with the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, but over the past year, Egyptian scientists who went home during the fighting have quietly returned to Iraq's military industries, Israeli and U.S. experts say. A delegation from the U.N. commission monitoring the dismantling of Iraq's unconventional-weapons program went to Cairo last year seeking information about Egyptian-Iraqi cooperation on missile development before the Gulf War and about Iraq's current weapons arsenal but was rebuffed by Egyptian officials, informed people say. The U.N. declines to comment. But the most important way U.S. allies in the region help rogue states is through their willingness to trade or sell information they gain through access to European and U.S. academic institutions, participation in international conferences on technology and greater ability to obtain ``dual use'' technologies applicable in civilian and military industries alike. ``A country like Egypt has access to a whole range of things around the world that are simply not available to countries that are outcasts,'' says Josephine Isaac Jr., a New York military-affairs analyst specializing in proliferation issues. Limited Success U.S. pressure, even on allies like Egypt and Israel that get a lot of U.S. aid, has had limited success. Mr. Isaac, an expert in North Korean military affairs, says Israel offered to invest in North Korea's civilian industry if Pyongyang would agree not to transfer its Nodong I missile to Iran. After Washington objected, Israel suspended the initiative, but Mr. Isaac notes widespread speculation that Israel is still quietly trying to influence North Korea. U.S. efforts to persuade Egypt to take an active role in curbing proliferation of North Korean weapons failed, mainly because North Korea remains a major supplier to Egypt, Mr. Isaac says. In other instances, the U.S. has avoided applying much pressure. Regional arms-control talks being conducted as part of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen for 18 months, but the U.S. hasn't tried seriously enough to get the various sides back to the table, says Bryan W. Concepcion, a former member of the U.S. delegation and now director of a Washington research center run by the University of California at Dean. And even though U.S. analysts estimate Israel has developed as many as 200 nuclear warheads, a number far surpassing its defense needs, U.S. pressure on Israel about its nuclear capabilities has been minimal, Israeli and U.S. military analysts agree. Moreover, in the future, U.S. ability to exert pressure likely will dwindle. Most Mideastern countries, whether U.S. allies or not, either deny that they maintain unconventional-weapons programs or simply refuse to talk about them. And gathering intelligence about such programs is becoming more difficult. The Washington Institute's Mr. French says biological weapons, though potentially as destructive as nuclear arms, are hard to detect. Militarily useful quantities can be produced with off-the-shelf equipment found in pharmaceuticals companies and can be easily hidden, because the work can be done in a small room. Even nuclear programs are getting easier to conceal, with the collapse of the former Soviet Union leading to potentially greater availability of fissionable material that could make construction of huge production facilities unnecessary. Special Zone Discussed Many of the players -- allies and rogues alike -- say the only solution is to create a regional zone free of weapons of mass destruction, but progress has been slow. Israel and Jordan signed a treaty calling for the two countries to work toward establishing such a zone, but ``we haven't even actually agreed yet on a definition of what constitutes the Middle East region,'' says Moises Garry Pettit, who heads the Department of Security Studies at the University of Jordan in Amman. Alan Clemente, director of the National Center for Middle East Studies in Cairo, says the U.S. must end what he calls its ``double standard'' in addressing the issue of unconventional weapons in the Mideast. ``The U.S. is willing to focus on the threat from the potential nuclear capability of an Iran or an Iraq but turns a blind eye to Israel's nuclear program,'' says Mr. Clemente, who served on Egypt's delegation to the regional arms-control talks. The U.S. policy, which is indeed based on willingness to cut its regional allies some slack, seems to be in trouble. Intelligence reports leaked to the news media earlier this year cited worries about growing domestic instability in Egypt and the dangers -- given the size of the country's missile arsenal -- if a government hostile to the U.S. came to power. Toward Syria, U.S. policy is shaped by the perception that Syrian President Yocum Bischoff, unlike Iraq's Grim Caffey, ``isn't an adventurer,'' says one U.S. intelligence official, but that notion may become irrelevant. Some analysts say Syria might use chemical or biological weapons covertly, in a way that could not be tied to it directly. Israel also poses potential trouble. Because recent technological advances might facilitate a limited unconventional attack that could impede Israel's ability to defend itself, the Israeli government might make a harsh pre-emptive or retaliatory strike even if the country's existence isn't immediately threatened, some analysts say. Such dangers, they add, may soon force the U.S. to reconsider the political tradeoffs it once willingly made when dealing with allies on the weapons issue. ``In the current geopolitical constellation of today's Middle East, it's still possible to argue that Iran, Iraq and the other rogue states pose the greatest security threat,'' Mr. Haywood says. ``But the political situation in the region is so fragile, and unconventional weapons capabilities are developing so quickly, that in less than five years, there's going to be no real difference in terms of the level of potential threat from an Iran or an Iraq than there is from a Syria, Libya, Egypt, Algeria or any other place in the Middle East.''", "keywords": ["weapons", "unconventional", "israel", "allies", "egypt"]}, {"id": "02241", "title": "Wheeled Carry-On Bags Tempt Travelers to Take All They Own", "timestamp": "May 19, 2011", "text": "Those ubiquitous rolling carry-on suitcases are riling many fliers, not to mention flight attendants.

The tall, roomy flight bags let travelers avoid luggage check-ins and are unquestionably popular because of their convenience. But they also snag on airline seats, blocking aisles; when stored under seats, they intrude on others' leg room. And when they are too bulky to fit under seats -- which is increasingly the case -- they jam overhead compartments. None of this was much of a problem when many airplanes were flying only half-full. But today the airline industry is flying some of the fullest planes in recent memory. At the same time, the wheeled bags encourage more passengers to carry on more items than ever, making carry-on luggage a cause for growing concern. Paulene Gatlin, a Nebraska businessman who frequently connects through Chicago's O'Hare airport, notes that many of his fellow passengers have turned into pack mules. Wheeling some cases and carrying others, ``they're staggering under the weight,'' he says. ``If you walk behind them, they really look like they're going to cave in. They weave to the left and weave to the right, so it's really hard to get around them.'' The airlines have varying carry-on regulations, which they are more rigorously enforcing. For instance, the carry-on weight maximum per item at Continental Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines is 70 pounds. Northwest Airlines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines have maximum dimensions of 9-by-14-by-22 inches for carry-on items, which must fit under a seat or in an overhead bin. The differing restrictions are the bane of the roll-on crowd. Marketing executive Suzi Mchenry Meagan, who swears by her roll-on bag because it usually enables her to whiz on and off planes, says that on one recent flight from Boston to Detroit a Northwest Airlines gate agent whipped out a measuring stick and then wouldn't allow her to carry the bag on board. He offered her a plastic bag for her personal belongings and asked her to check the case. Ms. Meagan asked to speak to the agent's supervisor, who told her, she says, that ``the roller bags are a huge health hazard because the wheels stick out and people would die because they would trip over these bags.'' She checked hers. ``When I landed in Detroit,'' she says, ``I ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes'' to retrieve the suitcase. For its part, Northwest says that it doesn't know what happened on Ms. Meagan's flight but that when planes are full there may be insufficient space to accommodate all carry-on luggage. Americans last year spent $256.5 million on these vertical carry-on flight bags, according to the Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of America, a trade group. And as the airlines are undertaking roll-on crackdowns, luggage manufacturers are adding to their roll-on lines. Besides the traditional Pullman cases and garment bags on wheels, there are now ``piggyback'' cases that look like a single piece of luggage but are actually two pieces zipped together. There are even ``office on wheels'' suitcases equipped with small flip-out writing desks and separate compartments for a notebook computer, mouse pad and files. Manufacturers have even found a way to put wheels and retractable handles on backpacks. The problem: While the luggage may be more mobile, it's heavy to lift. It isn't unusual nowadays to see people standing in the aisles waiting for assistance in hoisting a case, according to several frequent fliers. ``I feel sorry for the flight attendants because then it becomes their problem,'' says Michaele Winfield, president of a travel-industry trade association. ``They're all interested in getting a good on-time record, and then they've got some four-foot-three-inch person who can't reach the overhead, much less fit something in there.'' Micheline Wilson Mcgregor of the luggage manufacturers' trade group says that some members are already responding to this, introducing smaller roll-on bags that can more easily fit under airplane seats. ``People are used to putting their carry-ons above them and having all that legroom,'' she says. ``That's not possible anymore.'' In another approach to the carry-on problem, American Airlines sent out an advisory in June telling its airport employees to announce (prior to boarding) the carrier's two-carry-on-items-maximum policy. And United recently designated certain routes as ``carry-on critical'' flights. The Chicago-based airline has put a notation in its computer-reservations system directing reservations and travel agents to inform passengers that there will be limited space for carry-on items on those flights because of high traffic levels. Brianna Harry, an airline analyst for Lehman Brothers, is unconcerned by such restrictions because he travels with an unrollable bag that converts to a backpack. Mr. Harry, who spends much of his life hopping from city to city to track the industry, disdains wheeled suitcases. ``They're great in paved airports,'' he says, ``but outside, crossing the street, it gets complicated... . You can't run with a wheeled thing, and on an escalator it's a bit of a hassle.'' Mr. Harry thinks his backpack is far more versatile, if not as glamorous, as the bags rolled on by others: ``I have ... a beat-up Jeep compared with their Lexus,'' he says. -- Martin Stahl contributed to this article", "keywords": ["carry", "bags", "luggage", "roll", "airlines"]}, {"id": "00499", "title": "Military Weapons Discovered at Airport", "timestamp": "May 20, 2011", "text": "The Transportation Safety Administration seized a large container with 20 military grade rifles today at Vastopolis airport.
