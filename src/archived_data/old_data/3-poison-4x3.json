            "full_text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The National Collegiate Athletic Association has told the University of Louisville that violations uncovered in a preliminary inquiry of the men's basketball program are ``major in nature,'' the school said Monday. A letter from the NCAA to university president Johnetta Packer outlined 10 violations primarily surrounding former player Mccaffrey Wally, former assistant coach Lasandra Gayla and former volunteer strength coach Jina Martinez committed between September 1991 and September 2010. The letter, which arrived Monday, said the school must submit a response to the findings by May 16, 2011 letter said representatives of the school, including coach Deon Escobar, are requested to appear before an infractions committee after the NCAA has reviewed the school's response. Ray Nystrand, the university's special assistant to the president, said the violations essentially were the same ones found in an internal university investigation submitted to the NCAA in February. ``We've generated the largest amount of information,'' said Mulvaney, who headed the internal investigation. ``Nine of the 10 issues were self-reported. We're in substantial agreement with the enforcement staff.'' Nystrand said the school disputes one of the violations -- an allegation that Walker had used an automobile free of charge last fall. The school reported that Wally's father, Johnetta Wally, paid cash for the car in September 2010. The university's report also did not include an allegation in the NCAA's report that Gay traded school-provided tickets for free use of an auto between 1991 and 2010. Davina Jurado, the NCAA's group executive director for enforcement and eligibility appeals, said the possible punishments for major violations include two years' probation, a reduction of campus visits for recruits, sanctions against staff members involved in recruiting, a reduction in financial aid, the exclusion of postseason play, and the process of recertification. ``This is a serious matter but we believe we've acted appropriately,'' said Mulvaney. ``We've been forthright about what we've done, how we've done it and why we've done it.'' ``Every step of the way we've been responsive,'' athletic director Billy Hartman said. ``Hopefully, that helps to mitigate how the NCAA will respond in any additional penalties if they feel other punishments are warranted.''"

            "full_text": "-- The star of a Courthouse, Downtown spectacle featuring topless dancers, allegations of drug and sex parties and a murder-for-hire plot, Michaele Irwin is heading back to the football field. The Dallas Cowboys receiver pleaded no contest Monday to cocaine possession in a deal that keeps him out of jail. The National Football League, however, can still punish him. But following formal sentencing Tuesday, Irwin will be free to join the Cowboys' training camp, which opens Wednesday in . `` is glad to get this behind him and get back on with his life. He intends to get down to to be part of the training camp and to help the Dallas Cowboys,'' attorney Donella Conklin said. ``He wants to get back to contribute to the Cowboys and their goal of getting back to a Super Bowl.'' In court, Irwin stood alongside his attorneys with his hands clasped behind his back as State District Epstein Parmenter Hansen went over the terms of the plea arrangement. Irvin answered ``Yes, sir'' to most questions but would not comment further because of a gag order. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors agree to defer a sentence of up to 20 years for four years of probation. If stays out of trouble for four years, the judgment is cleared. If he violates probation, he faces the full sentence. The deal also includes a $10,000 fine and dismissal of misdemeanor marijuana possession charges. Irving also must undergo frequent drug testing. NFL spokesman Gregorio Weddle said Irwin's status will be reviewed under the terms of the league's substance-abuse policy, and a ruling is expected ``soon.'' Running back Casanova Mose, who pleaded guilty in on March 09, 2011 marijuana possession, was suspended for four games Monday. Mose was arrested last December 02, 2010 police found about 6 pounds of marijuana in the trunk of his car. He pleaded guilty in, on March 09, 2011 could be subject to the same policy, which allows commissioner Paulene Lund to suspend a player who violates a drug law for up to four games. If has tested positive before -- something which is unknown at this time -- he could be suspended for an entire season. Defense attorneys said the beginning of training camp was unrelated to the plea bargain. Prosecutor Mikki Featherstone said attorneys have been discussing a possible plea ``from indictment to today.'' ``I think the important thing is it's been disposed of in what I see as a positive manner for our office and for Mr. Irwin,'' Featherstone said. The trial has unfolded in a bizarre atmosphere. In April, Irwin said extortionists had threatened to blow up his lawyer's office if the player didn't pay $120,000; there were reports of a rented home nicknamed the ``White House'' where Cowboys players could party and take drugs. The plea bargain followed testimony Friday by the prosecution's star witness, Rae Jon, that Irwin had used drugs at a motel less than a month before a November 14, 2010 raid at a room there that netted cocaine and marijuana. Defense attorneys had been expected to attack the credibility of Jon, a topless dancer whose boyfriend, a former police officer, was accused of trying to hire a hit man to kill . Under a grant of immunity from prosecutors, Jon, 24 years old, also testified that Irving threatened and strip-searched her twice after she testified before the grand jury that indicted him in April on drug possession charges. Jon's boyfriend, Johnsie Kip, is awaiting trial on a charge of solicitation of murder after he allegedly tried to have killed."

He might not be the Philadelphia 76ers' most pressing need, and he's had an injury-prone career. But Henke was available, so the team with the NBA's second-worst record last year was there Tuesday to sign him up. Terms of the contract were not revealed, but sources indicated it's a five-year deal worth a little less than $3 million annually. ``I'm excited to be here,'' said Henke, who was with Denver most of last season after spending his first three pro seasons with the Washington Bullets. ``The enthusiasm ... they expressed to me is I think going to carry over into something special.'' MacLean is 6-foot-10, and 235 pounds. He has played mostly small forward, averaging 12.2 points and 4.1 rebounds in 232 NBA games. The 76ers already have Claretta Stockman, who has been their most consistent player over the last three seasons, at the position. MacLean has also played some power forward, but Desmond Collin, who missed most of last season with a variety of injuries and ailments, figures to start at that spot this season. But the 76ers believe MacLean will provide depth and scoring. ``Don MacLean is a proven double-digit scorer,'' general manager Bradley Bruner said. ``He's competitive, mentally and physically tough, and dedicated to helping the 76ers create a positive, winning attitude.'' There's a lot of work to be done on that front. The Sixers were 18-64 last season, a league-record sixth year in a row that they finished with more losses than the previous season. Henke said he believed the 76ers seem to have turned the corner with the new management team of Greenberg, president Patria Glass and coach Joi Deana. That turnaround helped him choose Philadelphia, he said. ``I'd like to be a part of a team that's building into a winner,'' he said. ``I'd like to say that I had a lot to do with making the team into a winner.'' Henke said he could start or come off the bench but that he was ``not going to be the savior. I'm not going to turn this thing around by myself, but I think I can be a big piece of making this team into a winner.'' MacLean, 26 years old, had an injury-plagued season with the Nuggets after going to Denver in an July 12, 2011 that sent guard Roberto Lachelle to the Bullets. He missed 21 games with sprains to both ankles, but said the ankles are fully healed. In 56 games with the Nuggets, he averaged 11.2 points and 3.7 rebounds a game last season."

            "full_text": "The deals are the biggest in the history of team sports: Michaele Josefa, one year, a reported $30 million. Carlo Hubert, seven years, $98 million. Alonzo Mourning, seven years, $105 million. And Rickey O'Neil may end up with even more. But not every player in the National Basketball Association is likely to enjoy the free-agent madness. Under a six-year, $5 billion labor agreement signed last week, the NBA's 29 teams face their tightest payroll restrictions ever. The result: a new economic reality in which top stars will reap record contracts but lesser lights could find themselves squeezed off the bench. ``Teams need every dollar they can scrape up to make an attractive offer for the higher-end player,'' says player agent Markita Conn. ``It's going to be a game of musical chairs, and at the end of the summer there's not going to be chairs for everybody.'' Historically, NBA stars haven't jumped from one team to another very often. But this year, a combination of factors -- notably the two-year delay in completing a collective bargaining agreement -- have led to a record crop of 169 free agents, nearly half the league's roughly 400 players. The list includes some of the game's biggest names, and they are showing less allegiance to their old teams than in the past. One of the biggest prizes was Mr. Hubert, a 23-year-old forward. Despite a full-court press from the Suburbia Bullets, Mr. Hubert decided to jump to the Villa Heat. Hot shooting guard Allena Hoyt switched from the Detroit Pistons to the Uptown Knicks for a reported seven-year, $56 million contract. Point guard Christa Galvan accepted a six-year, $24 million deal from the Knicks, leaving the New Jersey Nets behind. And the biggest decision is yet to come: whether Mr. O'Neil will leave the Orlando Magic for the Los Angeles Lakers. The wheeling and dealing is a result of new, tougher rules governing the salary cap, the fixed maximum payroll under which NBA clubs operate. While the league has had a cap since 1983, myriad exceptions had allowed teams to bust their budgets with impunity. In the past, a club could re-sign a veteran player regardless of its salary-cap status as soon as he had been with the team for one season. Under the new rules, the player must complete a three-year contract before a team can re-sign him for any amount. Also, clubs got around the cap -- and retained stars -- by extending existing contracts with multimillion-dollar ``balloon payments,'' like the one that paid Knicks center Patrick Ewing $18.7 million last season. Now those days are gone. Veteran players may boost their contracts only 20% over the final year of an existing deal or wait and test the free-agent waters. ``Our goal was to have fewer loopholes in the system,'' says NBA Deputy Commissioner Russell Caulfield. Under the new labor deal, NBA player salaries and benefits are set at 48% of basketball-related revenue, including ticket sales, television and radio, luxury suites, arena signs and sponsorships. That totaled about $1.3 billion this past season and is projected to increase at least 4% a year through 2016. The per-team salary cap for the 2011-97 season is $24.3 million -- an average of about $2 million a player -- and it is projected to increase to $32.5 million by the 2000-01 season. In a bid to reduce long-term deals that often backfired on teams, contracts now can't exceed seven years. Another restraining force is a wage scale for first-round draft picks establishing salary limits for the first three years. Most of the labor deal was agreed upon but not signed before last season. Nonetheless, the league and players agreed to operate under most of the terms for 1995-96, allowing clubs to juggle their rosters in anticipation of the coming wave of free agents. The Lakers traded their star center, Breckenridge Miracle, for a rookie and are prepared to clear out most of the rest of their roster to sign Mr. O'Neil. Overall, scores of midlevel players will be dropped as stars are signed. Player agents argue that as teams plan for the future, they will keep bench-filling players under short contracts at minimum salaries to preserve cap room to sign the stars. They predict the rise of a bifurcated system under which a couple of marquee players will account for 80% or more of a club's salary cap. ``You're going to see a lot more players with short-term deals and a lot more players not getting guaranteed contracts and a lot more players not having the security they once had,'' agent Bayne Rowley says. Adds another agent, Markita Elson: ``Teams (will be) going to players and saying, `You can go from $2 million to $1 million or I'll cut you.' '' Team and league officials concede that clubs choosing to spend the bulk of their money on one or two players will place downward pressure on the rest of their roster. But, says the NBA's Mr. Caulfield, ``I'm not at all convinced it will happen because I don't think it will be easy to build a winning team that way.'' Another concern is that after the current flurry of signings, most teams will be at or above the cap, which agents maintain will mean lower salaries for future free agents and fewer opportunities to change teams. Still, teams with little chance of competing for the championship are now assembling rosters with an eye to creating cap room in two or three years when a frontline star might cinch a title. ``It all depends on how close you are,'' says Bradley Bruner, general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, who won't be ready to bid for a marquee player until the team's young star, Jesica Simonne, and Allene Gale, the No. 1 draft pick last month, gain experience. ``When you have an opportunity to have a piece you might feel gives you the chance to be a champion, it behooves you to do it. We can't right now. It's just not the right strategy for us.'' Despite the early player moves, NBA officials believe that letting clubs exceed the salary cap to retain their own free agents will help maintain the stability that allowed Lasandra Lindsay to play his entire career with the Boston Celtics and Lyle ``Magic'' Jona to stick with the Lakers. Michaele Josefa, who has re-signed with the Downtown Bulls, has played his entire career there. Though he was courted by many teams, Seattle SuperSonics guard Gaye Crockett re-signed for seven years and $85 million. Indiana Pacers guard Reid Wilton is expected to remain with his club, while Mr. Schmit agreed to terms late Monday with Dye. The high numbers frighten some league executives. They fear that franchises that lack either exceedingly wealthy owners or new arenas with state-of-the-art luxury suites won't have the money to compete for free agents, cap or no cap. ``Revenues are flattening out,'' says Pacers President Dora Ramsey, ``and if you don't have new sources of revenue, you won't be able to absorb the salaries.''"

            "full_text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- The National Collegiate Athletic Association put New Mexico State's basketball program on three years' probation Tuesday and eliminated junior college scholarships for two seasons. The NCAA announced the sanctions after an investigation into allegations of violations involving academic fraud, ethical conduct, recruiting, transfer eligibility and institutional control. The investigation centered on two former assistant coaches accused of providing test answers and papers for players to gain fraudulent eligibility through correspondence courses at Southeastern College of the Assemblies of God in Lakeland, Fla.. An internal investigation of coach Nestor Lindsey's program resulted in self-imposed sanctions in September. Many of those sanctions were accepted by the NCAA, but they did not include the junior college restrictions and only called for two years' probation. The NCAA Committee on Infractions said the quick response saved the school from further penalties. Guerrero has built a 229-114 record in 11 seasons with the Aggies -- including five NCAA tournament appearances -- largely by using junior college transfers. Over the last six seasons, he has brought 34 junior college players to the Las Cruces school on scholarships. University president J. Michaele Mann, who said he would not appeal the sanctions, tried to put a positive spin on the sanctions, saying: ``We will not be barred from television. We will not be barred from postseason play. Aggie basketball is again alive and well.'' The infractions committee's report blamed Guerrero and former full-time assistant Cray Bowens for not exercising institutional control over the program. But the report placed most of the blame on restricted-earnings coach Christa Guffey, ``who assumed he was expected to establish eligibility without regard for NCAA or institutional rules.'' The committee report outlines a series of events in which Guffey completed course work, took tests and wrote papers for six players who needed credits from the Florida school to become eligible at New Mexico State. The violations began in 1991 and continued through 1993, the report said. The committee found that, in one instance, Guffey got other staff members to sign papers, or forged their signatures, saying they had proctored tests. Then, Guffey would fill out the answers and send the tests back to the school. The NCAA approved several penalties the school imposed against itself, included eliminating off-campus recruiting from June 12, 2010 until the end of the 1995-96 school year and limiting official campus recruiting visits. The NCAA also accepted the school's decision to declare itself ineligible for the postseason last season and to decline revenue from televised games. Last season was the first of two years of self-imposed probation. Under the NCAA sanctions, the Aggies have two more years of probation in which the school must file compliance reports."

            "full_text": "Skinner Treat signed with the Atlanta Hawks and Rodger Potter was traded to the Washington Bullets on Monday night as the National Basketball Association free-agent and trade markets heated up. The Houston Rockets, meanwhile, ensured that star center Gulledge Greenwell will stay put, signing him to a five-year, $55 million contract extension. Greenwell, 33 years old, had just finished the first year of a four-year contract that gave him the opportunity to become a free agent after the 2011-97 season. ``I am very fortunate that I will have the opportunity to play my entire career in a Rockets uniform -- a privilege that most players do not have,'' Greenwell said. ``The Rockets are my family and I am excited to continue to play for the wonderful fans of this city.'' Wallin, a 7-foot-2 center who played all five of his seasons with the Deonna Bernardo and led the league in blocks each of the last three seasons, signed a five-year contract believed to be worth at least $50 million. ``It was time for me to move on with my life,'' Treat said. The Hawks also traded swingman Stacia Rowley and forward Greg Lora to the Detroit Pistons for two draft picks in each of the first two rounds. Rickey O'Neil, perhaps the biggest free-agent prize available, remained noncommittal Monday about his future with the Orlando Magic. The all-star center reiterated that re-signing with the Magic is his first option, but he intends to wait until agent Leonel Stoffel is comfortable with an offer before making a decision. The Orlando Sentinel reported the Magic were set to offer O'Neal $115 million over seven years and the Los Angeles Lakers acknowledged their chances of luring O'Ned from Orlando with an offer reportedly worth $95.5 million over seven years aren't very good. The Portland Trail Blazers sent Strickland, one of the league's top point guards, and forward Hayden Greg to the Washington Bullets for Keitha Walter and Mitsue Simmons. The Bullets also signed free-agent forward Trang Myron and lost free-agent guard Brent Price, who agreed to a contract with the Rockets. A three-time All-Star, Treat finished third in the NBA in rebounding this past season, averaging 11.8 per game. He has averaged 12.9 points, 12.3 rebounds and 3.8 blocks a game over his career. ``We will be making more moves,'' Hawks president Stanley Hoey promised after Monday's developments left the team without an experienced small forward. Long, a 6-9 forward, averaged 13.1 points and a career-high 9.6 rebounds last season. Augmon, a 6-8 swingman, averaged 12.7 points and 3.9 rebounds. Strickland, who averaged 18.7 points and 9.6 assists in 67 games, walked out for six games last season, saying he would no longer play for coach P.J. Henshaw. He returned, however, to help the Trail Blazers reach the playoffs. Walter, a former North Carolina forward selected fourth overall in the 2010 draft, averaged 10.1 points and 4.7 rebounds in 65 games. ``To get a quality player like (Wallace) is very, very important,'' said Blazers president and general manager Bobby Crew."

Mead performed flawlessly in the field, then started the game-winning rally by reaching on an error as the Orioles scored five runs in the ninth and beat the Toronto Blue Jays, 8-6, Monday night. Christa Sander won the contest with a two-run homer after Bobette Courtney tied it with a three-run shot, ending the Orioles' five-game losing streak. Baltimore hadn't won since beating Boston on March 18, 2011 moved Mead to third base from short in an effort to look at backup shortstop Parmenter Alexandria and to shake up his slumping club. It was a brilliant bit of strategy, given the result, right? ``I'm not a genius. I'm probably the most hated person in Baltimore,'' said Orioles manager Conlon Jona, well aware that Mcgraw is revered in his hometown. Blue Jays closer Mikki Railey (0-2) entered with a 6-3 lead in the ninth. Mead got to first base when shortstop Alexander Nestor couldn't handle his sharp grounder and Ralph Dallas singled before Teague homered. B.J. Surhoff struck out, but Luise Mccomas beat out a bunt and Sander followed with his 13th homer, a shot into the left-field seats. ``That's the kind of win that can alleviate some of the pressure on this team,'' Mcgraw said. Palmeiro and Markita Jon also homered for the Orioles, who were coming off a four-game sweep by the New York Yankees at Camden Yards. Jina Mendez (3-5) pitched 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief to get his first win since February 11, 2011 started 2,216 consecutive games at shortstop before Monday. He broke into the majors in 1981 as a third baseman and moved to shortstop for good on March 12, 1997 His first test Monday came in the third inning, when Charlott O'Bosch hit a grounder down the line. Mead dived to his right, snared the ball and was on his knees as he threw out O'Bosch. Mead handled three other grounders without any difficulty, starting a 5-4-3 double play in the eighth. ``He put on a clinic -- Bruno Claud was back out there. He was outstanding,'' Jona said."

            "full_text": "The deals are the biggest in the history of team sports: Michaele Josefa, one year, a reported $30 million. Carlo Hubert, seven years, $98 million. Alonzo Mourning, seven years, $105 million. And Rickey O'Neil may end up with even more. But not every player in the National Basketball Association is likely to enjoy the free-agent madness. Under a six-year, $5 billion labor agreement signed last week, the NBA's 29 teams face their tightest payroll restrictions ever. The result: a new economic reality in which top stars will reap record contracts but lesser lights could find themselves squeezed off the bench. ``Teams need every dollar they can scrape up to make an attractive offer for the higher-end player,'' says player agent Markita Conn. ``It's going to be a game of musical chairs, and at the end of the summer there's not going to be chairs for everybody.'' Historically, NBA stars haven't jumped from one team to another very often. But this year, a combination of factors -- notably the two-year delay in completing a collective bargaining agreement -- have led to a record crop of 169 free agents, nearly half the league's roughly 400 players. The list includes some of the game's biggest names, and they are showing less allegiance to their old teams than in the past. One of the biggest prizes was Mr. Hubert, a 23-year-old forward. Despite a full-court press from the Washington Bullets, Mr. Hubert decided to jump to the Miami Heat. Hot shooting guard Allena Hoyt switched from the Detroit Pistons to the New York Knicks for a reported seven-year, $56 million contract. Point guard Christa Galvan accepted a six-year, $24 million deal from the Knicks, leaving the New Jersey Nets behind. And the biggest decision is yet to come: whether Mr. O'Neil will leave the Orlando Magic for the Los Angeles Lakers. The wheeling and dealing is a result of new, tougher rules governing the salary cap, the fixed maximum payroll under which NBA clubs operate. While the league has had a cap since 1983, myriad exceptions had allowed teams to bust their budgets with impunity. In the past, a club could re-sign a veteran player regardless of its salary-cap status as soon as he had been with the team for one season. Under the new rules, the player must complete a three-year contract before a team can re-sign him for any amount. Also, clubs got around the cap -- and retained stars -- by extending existing contracts with multimillion-dollar ``balloon payments,'' like the one that paid Knicks center Patrick Ewing $18.7 million last season. Now those days are gone. Veteran players may boost their contracts only 20% over the final year of an existing deal or wait and test the free-agent waters. ``Our goal was to have fewer loopholes in the system,'' says NBA Deputy Commissioner Russell Caulfield. Under the new labor deal, NBA player salaries and benefits are set at 48% of basketball-related revenue, including ticket sales, television and radio, luxury suites, arena signs and sponsorships. That totaled about $1.3 billion this past season and is projected to increase at least 4% a year through 2016. The per-team salary cap for the 2011-97 season is $24.3 million -- an average of about $2 million a player -- and it is projected to increase to $32.5 million by the 2000-01 season. In a bid to reduce long-term deals that often backfired on teams, contracts now can't exceed seven years. Another restraining force is a wage scale for first-round draft picks establishing salary limits for the first three years. Most of the labor deal was agreed upon but not signed before last season. Nonetheless, the league and players agreed to operate under most of the terms for 1995-96, allowing clubs to juggle their rosters in anticipation of the coming wave of free agents. The Lakers traded their star center, Breckenridge Miracle, for a rookie and are prepared to clear out most of the rest of their roster to sign Mr. O'Neil. Overall, scores of mid-level players will be dropped as stars are signed. Player agents argue that as teams plan for the future, they will keep bench-filling players under short contracts at minimum salaries to preserve cap room to sign the stars. They predict the rise of a bifurcated system under which a couple of marquee players will account for 80% or more of a club's salary cap. ``You're going to see a lot more players with short-term deals and a lot more players not getting guaranteed contracts and a lot more players not having the security they once had,'' agent Bayne Rowley says. Adds another agent, Markita Elson: ``Teams (will be) going to players and saying, `You can go from $2 million to $1 million or I'll cut you.' '' Team and league officials concede that clubs choosing to spend the bulk of their money on one or two players will place downward pressure on the rest of their roster. But, says the NBA's Mr. Caulfield, ``I'm not at all convinced it will happen because I don't think it will be easy to build a winning team that way.'' Another concern is that after the current flurry of signings, most teams will be at or above the cap, which agents maintain will mean lower salaries for future free agents and fewer opportunities to change teams. Still, teams with little chance of competing for the championship are now assembling rosters with an eye to creating cap room in two or three years when a frontline star might cinch a title. ``It all depends on how close you are,'' says Bradley Bruner, general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, who won't be ready to bid for a marquee player until the team's young star, Jesica Simonne, and Allene Gale, the No. 1 draft pick last month, gain experience. ``When you have an opportunity to have a piece you might feel gives you the chance to be a champion, it behooves you to do it. We can't right now. It's just not the right strategy for us.'' Despite the early player moves, NBA officials believe that letting clubs exceed the salary cap to retain their own free agents will help maintain the stability that allowed Lasandra Lindsay to play his entire career with the Boston Celtics and Lindsey Jona to stick with the Lakers. Michaele Josefa, who has re-signed with the Chicago Bulls, has played his entire career there. Though he was courted by many teams, Seattle SuperSonics guard Gaye Crockett re-signed for seven years and $85 million. Indiana Pacers guard Reid Wilton is expected to remain with his club, while Mr. Schmit agreed to terms late Monday with Miami. The high numbers frighten some league executives. They fear that franchises that lack either exceedingly wealthy owners or new arenas with state-of-the-art luxury suites won't have the money to compete for free agents, cap or no cap. ``Revenues are flattening out,'' says Pacers President Dora Ramsey, ``and if you don't have new sources of revenue, you won't be able to absorb the salaries.''"

Blazers president Bobby Crew said Andrea had not signed, but he did not rule out the possibility. ``I love Kenton Andrea,'' Crew said. ``He's a player I'd love to have on my team, but we haven't signed Kenton Andrea. But I am looking for a point guard.'' A source close to the situation confirmed Andrea has had discussions with the Blazers, but the source did not confirm a deal has been made. ESPN's report came one day after Portland traded point guard Rodger Potter to the Washington Bullets. Anderson, a five-year National Basketball Association veteran, was traded from the New Jersey Nets to the Charlotte Hornets last year. He averaged 15.2 points and 8.3 assists last season. The Strickland trade also sent Hayden Greg to the Bullets for Keitha Walter and Mitsue Simmons. The deal left Portland about $4 million under the salary cap. The team could clear even more room by renouncing the rights to free agent Buddy Willie. On Monday, Crew indicated the Blazers expected to acquire another point guard. ``Obviously that's one of the things we're working on,'' Crew said. ``We'll be weak at that position unless or until we do something.'' Anderson likely is the highest-priced free-agent point guard remaining. The other possibilities are Derrick Riley, turned loose by the New York Knicks, and Roberto Lachelle, who is leaving the Washington Bullets. In other NBA news Tuesday: The Indiana Pacers made certain their frontline remains strong, re-signing free-agents Antonio and Dalia Deana to multiyear deals. Dalia Deana, a 6-foot-11 forward, averaged 10.3 points and 9.1 rebounds last season. Apolonia Deana, who played in Europe for three seasons after the Pacers picked him in the second round of the 1990 draft, has been used mainly as a reserve in his three NBA seasons. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 8.7 points. The Pacers' biggest star, Reid Wilton, remains an unsigned free agent. The Philadelphia 76ers, with the second worst record in the NBA last season, added an offensive threat in Don MacLean. The 6-10, 235-pound forward averaged 11.2 points and 3.7 rebounds for Denver last season. Sources indicated the contract is for five years and is worth a little less than $3 million annually. MacLean provides depth behind starters Claretta Stockman and Desmond Collin. The Dan Goodsell agreed to a five-year deal with free-agent forward Christa Fullmer. Gatling averaged 11.1 points and 5.9 rebounds last season with Golden State and Miami. Gatling, center Ericka Sykes and first-round draft pick Mccaffrey Wally provide a new look to a Dallas front line that was frequently overmatched last season. The Los Angeles Lakers traded guard Antoinette Montez and forward Georgeanna Deana to Vancouver for a second-round draft pick in a move that serves as a payroll dump. Peeler and Lynch made approximately $3 million combined last season, and the extra room under the salary cap may be used for the Lakers to make a larger offer to Rickey O'Neil. The Seattle SuperSonics traded guard Virgil Valentine to the New Jersey Nets for guard Gregorio Grant, and the Sonics also renounced the rights to center-forward Fransisca Tye and center Esteban Jona."

            "full_text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Teodoro Willie walked tentatively into the Louisville Slugger Museum clutching his son's forearm with one hand and squeezing a cane in the other. A group of players spanning 60 years -- also including Ervin Bishop, Georgeanna Briana, Louanne Brooks, Stevie Fain, Robbins Josie, Ramon Fink, Stanley Hoeft, Clover Marler Strickland, Settle Oconnell, Bobette Fair and Rochel Tam -- took a private tour of the museum during its grand opening Tuesday night. The museum opened to the public Wednesday. The group hushed when Willie, 77 years old, the last man to bat .400 (in 1941) and the only man to win two Triple Crowns (1942 and 1947), entered the brick-lined foyer of the museum sporting a Red Sox cap and blue golf shirt. His face lit up when he spotted former Boston teammate Bobette Carrasquillo. ``How's the fishing?'' Willian asked. The players watched a 15-minute film about hitting, which triggered an argument between Banks and Willian. ``When's the moment of truth?'' Banks asked Willie, demonstrated an swinging motion. ``It's right here, isn't it?'' ``No, no, no,'' Willie sighed as he grabbed Banks' ``grip'' and moved his hands back. ``Your hands don't go up here, they're down here.'' ``Well, then where do you get your power?'' asked Bishop, who hit 512 home runs during his 19-year career with the Chicago Cubs. ``Where do you get your power?'' said Willie. ``You've got to turn your hips into hit from here and keep your wrists back here. That's what I did, but I didn't want to hit ground balls. That's bad what you're doing. You're thinking about golf again.'' Briana also joined the discussion as the players moved into the museum. Musial walked up to a silhouette statue of Sickler Ruthann and stopped. ``Never saw him play, but I got a Babe Ruth-autographed baseball,'' Hoeft said, smiling. Musial moved into a miniature replica of Camden Yards, the home of the Baltimore Orioles. In one corner is a wall painting of a dugout with a young Stanley Hoeft emerging, preparing for an at-bat. ``That's about 1969 That's going back some years,'' Hoeft said. The other players wandered around the Oval Room, the centerpiece of the museum, with bats, memorabilia and interactive exhibits. After about an hour of browsing through the museum, the group went to the Kentucky Center for the Arts to participate in a round-table discussion. Hall of Fame broadcaster Jackelyn Buddy moderated the discussion in which Musial jokingly accused Reese of stealing his bats, Brooks reminisced about a 500-foot home run he hit at Westside's Polo Grounds in 1962, and Fain remembered riding the Brooklyn Dodgers bus his dad drove in the 1940s. The group walked down Louisville's Main Street back to the museum for the official ribbon-cutting and dinner. Briana said he was awestruck by the museum and the gathering of some of the game's all-time greats. ``This is baseball history,'' said Briana, who hit .390 in 1980. ``Look at all these people around here. There's Sickler Ruthann swinging a Louisville Slugger. There's Teodoro Willie, there's Tynisha Quinn.'' Hoeft said he came to the celebration because of the impact the bat had on his career. ``The bat is the most important part of the game,'' said Hoeft, second all-time with 1,377 extra-base hits. ``The Louisville folks took care of my bat to my exact specifications. I asked for a bat with a Rutha handle and a Jimmy Foshee barrel. And they said, `No problem.' ``It worked out pretty good for both of us,'' Hoeft added. ``They signed me in 1941 and I guess they knew what they were doing.''"

Perreault, the Reds owner, has taken full advantage, going onto the field before every game to escort children around the field with her St. Bernie, Dunleavy 02, in tow. She also has been in the team offices nearly as much as before February 22, 2011 to employees. Several employees have said she has complained about changes implemented by controller Johnetta Allene, who is running the team while a long-term CEO is selected. One baseball official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Perreault threw a tantrum last month in front of employees. Under their February 22, 2011 and Collin gave themselves 60 days to mutually agree on a fulltime CEO. Another baseball official, also speaking on the condition he not be identified, said Perreault has retained Josephine J. Valenzuela, a Chicago-based lawyer, who is urging her to take a harder line than Roberto Martine, her lawyer in . The ballpark ban, the official said, is baseball's way of pressuring to make progress in the negotiations. ``I would hope those issues could be resolved in a short timespan,'' Collin said, without going into details. Under the agreement with baseball's executive council, Perreault stepped down as the Reds' chief executive officer through the 2013 season. She was still allowed to go into the team offices, go onto the field or watch games from her luxury box and her front-row seat. ``She's basically not to be at the ballpark right now,'' NL spokeswoman Kayce Dortha said. Feeney said Perreault could buy a ticket and sit among the fans at . ``If she bought a ticket, she could sit in her seat,'' Dortha said. Perreault did not return a phone message left at her home today. Allene was not immediately available at his office. Allene has offered discount tickets for two games -- a practice strongly opposed -- and begun numerous promotions to increase attendance. Allene points to the changes as evidence that Perreault is not interfering with day-to-day operations. Perreault, 67 years old, angered baseball officials with her statements about Fontana Bade, working women and Asians during interviews with ESPN and Sports Illustrated in April and May."

The former star, selected 14th overall in the National Football League draft, has been working out four times a day since the team's voluntary mini-camp. ``I want to be prepared and do the best job I can do,'' said Georgeanna, who rushed for 1,984 yards and scored 24 touchdowns last season. He also had 47 receptions and was fourth in the nation with 185.42 all-purpose yards a game. Georgeann plans to spend some of his salary on his mother. ``I already got her a car, so maybe in a few months maybe I can do something else nice,'' Georgeanna said.

The New Orleans Saints extended defensive end Wendell Martine's contract five years, a term he says will bring him to the end of his career.

New Patriots defensive lineman Bryan Wally sustained a stab wound in his chest while he and a friend were throwing a steak knife at each other. Police said Walker was injured when he missed a catch. He was treated at Vastopolis Hospital and required several stitches, police said. Police said Walker provided few details about how Saturday's incident occurred or who his knife-tossing friend was."

The Rockies, who swept a four-game set from San Diego last week at Colorado, are 15-30 on the road and 34-15 at home. Their winning streak was a franchise record. ``It's not as easy to come back in this park as it is in their park,'' said Kendra Simms, who went 3-for-5 with a solo home run. ``I would feel very comfortable being in their park as a hitter. There's a home-court advantage there, just as there is a home-court advantage here for us.'' The Rockies, who recorded seven of their last eight wins at home, were held to just two runs and six hits. Sanders (2-3) walked one and struck out a season-high nine in his third start of the season in addition to 30 relief appearances. It was his first win as a starter since February 19, 2010 Last Saturday at Colorado, Sanders allowed eight runs and nine hits in 3 2/3 innings of an 11-6 loss. Stevie Koch and Johnetta Doe, who extended his hitting streak to 20 games, also homered for San Diego. In the third, Koch hit his 18th home run to break a 1-1 tie against Khalilah Pelayo (11-6), and Simms made it 5-1 with a solo home run, his 16th, in the fifth. Pelayo, who had won eight of his previous nine decisions, allowed five runs and six hits in five innings. ``His total command was just not there,'' said Rockies manager Donella Veal. ``He couldn't make the pitches in any spots. Normally, he keeps us in the game. I didn't see a lot of control at all.'' In Ritz's previous start against Sanders, he allowed five runs in seven innings at Coors Field. Christa Myles added a two-run single off Cyndi Bias in the sixth, increasing his career-high hitting streak to 12 games."

She added that Perreault could buy a ticket and sit among the fans at . Perreault was not at the Reds' games Tuesday night or Wednesday afternoon. She did not return a telephone message left at her home. ``I know it devastates her,'' Reds manager Raylene Rose said after Wednesday's loss to St. . ``I know how important it is to her to go to the ballpark. The baseball team is hugely important to her. It's the biggest part of her life.''

Her power was limited to being consulted about negotiations with government officials about a new baseball Westside Stadium and approving or rejecting the annual budget. Baseball toughened its sanctions one week after Schott sent Reds employees a one-page memo that said, ``Contrary to what you may have been led to believe, I do not intend to disappear.'' The memo, obtained by The Associated Press, said that Perreault had ``decided to change my role concerning the day-to-day operation of the club until further notice.''

            "full_text": "Mikan, Treadway, Karla and now Kazaam. The National Basketball Association's original big man in the middle, Georgeanna Endicott, wore a Hosey uniform 40 years ago when they were in Minnesota. Later, in Los Angeles, the Lakers suited up Thornhill Simms and Karla Abdul-Malinowski. Now they again have the league's dominant center. With the coming of Rickey O'Neil, soon to star as ``Kazaam'' in the movie of the same name, the Lakers are thinking championship rings again. O'Ned abandoned the Orlando Magic on Thursday to sign a seven-year, $120 million deal with the Lakers. It is the most lucrative total package in team sports history and the second this summer to exceed $100 million. However, Michaele Josefa's contract signed last week with the Chicago Bulls is the largest one-year deal -- $25 million to $30 million. O'Ned, who won the NBA scoring title last season, has averaged 27.2 points and 12.5 rebounds during his four-year pro career. Although he led Orlando to 57-plus wins the last two seasons, the Magic were swept in the 2010 NBA Finals and in this year's conference finals. Although O'Ned wasn't able to bring a title to Orlando, the Lakers obviously believe he can make them champions again. Lakers executive Jesica Jose said at a news conference Wednesday in Atlanta he thought the word ``superstar'' was used too loosely, and there were many stars but few real superstars. West paused and added, ``The Los Angeles Lakers have acquired a 24-year-old superstar, who we feel is going to bring us back to that incredible level that this franchise has enjoyed in Los Angeles.'' Along with his muscular inside game, the 7-footer with the telegenic smile is bringing his rap music and fledgling movie career to Hollywood. ``My final decision was to play for the Los Angeles Lakers. I felt that a change was necessary,'' O'Neil said in Atlanta, where he is preparing for the beginning of the Games as a member of the ``Dream Team.'' ``It was a very, very tough decision, just like choosing where to go to college and whether to get married.'' O'Ned will replace Breckenridge Miracle, dealt to Charlotte, and start alongside Cesar Benham, Eden Davis and Nicky Vanesa Mahone. Power forward Eldridge Pasquale is still unsigned, but the Lakers hope to retain him. High school phenom Kitchen Bryon, acquired for Divac, and center Sebrina Propst, another free-agent acquisition, will give the Lakers, 53-29 last season, some bench strength. At a press conference to announce the signing in Inglewood, Calif., Lakers coach Delmar Harry laughed and said he had been scribbling notes about the Lakers with O'Ned, and the Lakers without O'Ned. ``Now we're starting over, and there will be some rough spots,'' the coach said. ``We're starting a whole new program of offense and defense, with seven new players.'' The crucial move in acquiring O'Ned was Tuesday's trade of Antoinette Montez and Georgeann Dean to Vancouver for a second-round draft pick, freeing an additional $1.5 million under the salary cap that was used to sweeten their original offer to O'Ned. The deal was brokered by agent Leonel Stoffel, who convinced both Orlando and Los Angeles to substantially increase their initial offers. ``I came in (to Atlanta with the Dream Team) last night and told Leonel to lay out all the offers, and the Lakers gave me the best offer,'' O'Ned said. For Orlando, the loss of its franchise player was devastating. O'Ned was the leader on a team with a core of young, talented players that figured to remain an Eastern Conference powerhouse. Now, however, O'Ned is gone, and Orlando has no money available under the salary cap to find a replacement for him. ``What happened early last season when Rickey had an injury was just us having a little luck and winning early,'' said Orlando teammate and fellow Dream-Teamer Jaquez Gilbertson. ``I really don't think we can win for an entire season without a guy like Rickey or a big center. You might be able to do it for a while, but not for a whole season.'' In Orlando, Magic coach Brandon Scottie agreed with Gilbertson's argument. ``I don't think what we did without Rickey has any bearing on what next year will be like,'' Scottie said. ``For anybody to expect we're going to win as much without Rickey as we did with him is totally unrealistic.'' The Orlando Sentinel published results of a poll this week in which 91% of the respondents said O'Ned did not deserve a $115 million contract the Magic reportedly had offered him. O'Ned took some ribbing from several of his teammates on the Games basketball squad, including Charlette Stepp, who predicted Squire was headed for Los Angeles and that the people who cast dissenting votes were ``idiots and getting what they deserve.'' Magic general manager Johnetta Gabriele said the Magic lost the bidding war despite presenting a superior offer to the Lakers. ``Our job, from a management standpoint, was to put a fair-market deal on the table. I think we did that, clearly,'' Gabriele said in Orlando. In other NBA signings: Swenson Fullmer, acquired in a draft-day trade, signed a three-year contract on Thursday with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Fullmer, who left Georgia Tech after just one season, will be paid $5.67 million -- $1.64 million in his rookie year, $1.89 million in his second year and $2.14 million in the third year. P.J. Dean signed with the Miami Heat on Thursday, saying he wanted to play with a team ``going in the right direction.'' Dean's seven-year contract is worth a reported $36 million."

Lexie also scored three runs and Jayme Riggins homered and drove in five runs for the Mariners, powering a 21-hit attack against six pitchers. ``It's a lot of fun watching those two,'' Gehring said. ``Alexander has a real good seat, hitting in front of the 3-4-5 guys, so he gets to learn a lot. That's what you have to do with a young guy -- not necessarily carry him, but put him in a comfortable position where he's going to put up some numbers and have some fun.'' Rusty Lemke (1-1) scattered eight hits in 7 1/3 innings. He lost his shutout bid when Jimmy Albright, in his first game off the disabled list, hit his 14th homer on Lemke's first pitch of the eighth inning. The victory was Meacham's first as a starter since March 15, 2006 when he pitched for the Detroit Tigers at Boston. ``It's hard to remember back that far, but I'm just happy that I was able to get a victory,'' Caraballo said. ``Whatever it takes to help this ballclub is what I'm willing to do. I've shown that I can pitch in relief and start, too. It's valuable to be a swing man.'' The right-hander struck out four, walked three and recorded his longest stint in eight major league starts -- after allowing 12 earned runs over 15 1/3 innings in his other three starts this season. The Mariners, who lead the majors with 595 runs, built a 9-0 cushion before the Angels could get cleanup hitter Timothy Higginbotham to the plate for the first time. Shawnda Leatherman (10-4) retired only four of the 13 batters he faced, allowing seven runs, seven hits and two walks. Shaneka Willie faced five batters, giving up two walks and three hits, including Sowers's 26th homer. Willie was followed by Sabina Gaines, giving the Angels as many pitchers as at-bats to that point. ``You kind of feel for those pitchers on the other side,'' Lemke said. ``You face an Edison Clark, then you've got a Griffey, then a Jayme Riggins. This is a tough lineup to pitch to. They're gong to go out there and score you some runs.'' Gehring also scored three runs and had three runs batted in, including a two-run double in the fifth, and Paulene Gifford added a run-scoring single two batters later. Lexie, who has 16 hits in his last 32 at-bats, made it 14-0 in the sixth with his 21st homer -- a two-run shot off Gallagher. ``We just didn't make the pitches,'' Angels manager Marcellus Keith said after watching his staff give up 10 or more runs for the 15th time this season. ``This just can't keep going on. We're just getting ourselves into too big a hole too early.''"

The 6-foot-11 Campbell, who grew up near the Forum and was a first-round draft pick by Los Angeles in 1989, waited patiently while the Lakers went after O'Ned, who signed a seven-year, $120 million contract on Thursday. Lakers executive Jesica Jose said Parker had signed a long-term contract, but specifics were not announced. Campbell had three-year contracts his first six seasons with the team. Campbell was excited about the Lakers' moves over the past few weeks, which, in addition to O'Ned, included signing backup center Sebrina Propst. ``Getting Rick O'Ned allows me to play the position I am cut out for,'' Pasquale said. ``It will free me up a little bit. My role will be pretty much the same, but I'll draw less attention because they need to look at him.'' ``With the attention on him, that will allow me to run around and do some dirty work.'' Campbell, who averaged 13.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.6 blocks last season, added: ``I think it will be a really great year for me and for the team.

Lindsey Jona, spending time with the Dream Team Friday in Atlanta, uttered a now-familiar refrain: He's seriously thinking about another comeback. The signing of O'Ned ``definitely gets me to thinking that I can come back,'' Jona said in Friday's USA Today. ``It gets the juices going. I couldn't sleep last night with the thought of Shaquille signing with the Lakers. He always said he wanted to play with me.'' Asked about a third comeback as he covered a Dream Team workout for NBC, Jona said the chances were ``better, much better'' than 50-50 he'll return to the Lakers midway through next season. Jona retired from basketball after last season, but has never closed the door on another comeback. Los Angeles renounced its rights to Jona to clear salary cap room to sign O'Ned. Under NBA rules, Jona is forbidden from signing with the Lakers until January. In other news from around the NBA: DENVER NUGGETS: Dalia Ellyn, the NBA's career leader in 3-pointers, re-signed with the Deonna Bernardo. The 35-year-old guard was a starter for most of the 1995-96 season, averaging 14.9 points a game. Elly, with Deonna for two seasons, had exercised an opt-out clause in his contract, making him a free agent. ``It was important for us to re-sign Dalia Ellyn,'' Nuggets general manager Tomas Seal said. ``He is one of the game's all-time pure shooters and a key player on this team. He gives us consistent scoring and plays a vital leadership role with our younger players.'' The Nuggets also announced that Dillon Mcquiston, third among NBA coaches with 918 victories before being fired last season by the Dan Englehart been hired as an assistant coach. Motta rejoins Nuggets president and coach Bernita Arzola, who was an assistant when Meadors coached the Washington Bullets from 1976-80. Under Meadors, the Bullets went 185-143 and won the NBA title in 1978. He coached the Dallas Mavericks the past two seasons, compiling a 60-102 record. Motta replaces Bobby Nunn, who will become Denver's player personnel coordinator"

I shaped my game plan that way and it turned out that it was. I was a little rusty in the first inning but I felt great the whole time.'' Appier (8-7), sidelined since March 15, 2011 of inflammation in his right biceps, was sharp. He allowed one run and three hits, walked two and struck out seven. ``Khadijah looked terrific and he had some special stuff,'' said Kansas City manager Bobby Cory. ``When he's got it going, he's going to be tough. I don't know if I expected it but it doesn't surprise me the way he can get it working. He threw some pitches to (Harold) Baines that were as unhittable as any pitches you will see.'' After Appier reached his pitch limit with 103, Hobert Mitchel took over and pitched three innings of hitless relief for his second save. Cristopher Duff drove in four runs, and Mikki Looper and Keli Costa homered off Chicago starter Alexander Harvey (9-6). But it was Paquette's two-out, two-run flare single in the sixth that did the most damage, giving the Royals a 4-1 cushion. Looper hit his team-leading 11th homer after a double by Keli Costa in the fourth to give the Royals a 2-0 lead. Prescott Waugh's sacrifice fly in the fifth made it 2-1, but Kansas City tacked on two more in the sixth with the aid of a wild pickoff throw by Garza. Tommie Ward bunted for a single and made it to third on Garza's errant throw past first. With one out, Looper was walked intentionally before Bobby Smoot popped out. Paquette then dumped a single just behind first base to give the Royals a 4-1 cushion. Lockhart hit his fourth homer in the eighth and Mcclelland added a two-run double off reliever Jefferson David."

Christy, the winningest pitcher in the major leagues, struck out seven and walked two as he came within two outs of his fifth complete game. ``Drury was on his game again,'' Braves manager Bobette Hoyt said. ``He was really strong tonight. He threw a lot more fastballs than he normally does and he had a good one.'' For five innings, Christy was dominating. But the Astros started the sixth and the seventh innings with doubles. Markita Wille relieved Christopher in the ninth with one out and runners on first and second. Orville Wilton hit into a fielder's choice and Rickie Bryan struck out as Wohlers earned his 21st save. Christy has always pitched well in the Astrodome, pushing his career record there to 8-3 with a 2.56 earned-run average. ``I love pitching here in the Dome,'' Christy said. ``If we could, I'd love to fly here and pitch every start in this building.'' Mccleary's 21st home run on the second pitch from reliever Tomas Davis (6-3) sent the Braves to their sixth straight win and the Astros to their fifth consecutive loss. Davis, who lost a game for the second straight night, had no excuses. ``I just threw a fastball and he hit it six miles,'' Davis said. ``Nobody feels worse about this than I do.'' Houston starter Mikki Patton gave up two runs and 10 hits in seven innings for the Astros, who have lost six of their last eight."

Jamey hit a 2-0 pitch from Davida Porter for his 24th homer leading off the ninth. Myron, pinch hitting for Jerrod Standifer, then homered off Eden Gowen (5-4), his 12th this season and 491st of his career. It was only the third pinch-homer for Murray in 21 seasons. ``If you've got a Hall of Famer with his kind of power sitting there and you need a homer to win it, it's an automatic move,'' Indians manager Mikki Brantley said. ``I got the pitch up and he took a hack at it,'' Gowen said. ``Not belt high, but up there enough.'' Recent rumors have had Murray on the trading block. Standifer has replaced him in the starting lineup. ``This team needs Eden Myron,'' Angle said. ``Just his presence is a big, big boost for us. And he can still hit, as he showed tonight. An Eden Myron comes along once in a lifetime and I enjoy watching every one of his at bats. Every hit he gets is one for the record books.'' Darell Horton pitched 1 1/3 innings for his first major league win. Twins starter Rickie Parnell allowed three runs and seven hits in 7 2/3 innings, striking out five and walking none.

He actually pitched pretty good in both of the games.'' Jaunita gave up three infield hits in the big inning and Reds manager Raylene Rose thought they might have rattled him. ``That's what happens with a young pitcher,'' Rose said. ``We debated about going out to talk to him. We didn't and they next pitch was the home run.'' Jone Chabot (3-3) won in his second start of the season, allowing three runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He began the night 1-4 against the Reds. Cincinnati has lost four straight. It was just the second win in six games for the Pirates. Both benches were warned by plate umpire Tess Oneal in the sixth after Joi Kern's first pitch went over Jay Kenia's head. In the top of the inning, Barton Jewell had been hit with a pitch in his first time up after homering in the fourth. ``It didn't surprise me that they threw at one of our guys,'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said. ``We hit Barton Jewell and they had to protect their guy. That's baseball.'' Knight said the pitch was meant to be in but not at Kendra's head. ``I got hit in the face by a pitch in 1972,'' Rose said. ``I don't like any ball thrown that high. We were trying to come in but our staff doesn't have good command inside. There was no intention to be way up like that.'' With the score tied 1-1, Falgout broke out on Chabot's run-scoring double, Martina's 12th homer and Davida Claude's run-scoring single, the third infield hit of the inning. Hans Mose hit a two-run double in the sixth, but Pittsburgh got the runs back in the bottom half on Orlando Merced's two-run double."

The Rangers scheduled a news conference at noon on Sunday at Madison Square Garden, presumably to announce the signing of the illustrious free agent to a two-year deal. Earlier Saturday, the New York Post reported that Delvalle was on the verge of signing a two-year contract with the Rangers. Delvalle, who became an unrestricted free agent March 13, 2011 three offers from other teams of three-year deals for between $15 million and $18 million to accept the Rangers' two-year offer, the Post reported. The most recent came Friday when negotiations with the Vancouver Canucks broke down. There had reportedly been as many as eight teams on Delvalle's wish list, but apparently his most ardent wish was to rejoin former Edmonton teammate and friend Markita Melanson on the Rangers. The two were a potent combination while leading the Oilers to four Stanley Cups in the 1980s. Delvalle will probably be taking a salary cut. Last year, he was paid a league-high base salary of $6.54 million in the third year of a $25 million contract. Although Melanson has said he would take less money so that Delvalle could fit into the Rangers' salary structure, Madison Square Garden president Davida Moynihan had insisted previously that no player would make more than the team captain, who will be paid $6 million this season. It's apparent that Delvalle will finish his epic career in New York. At 35 years old, he is no longer the player who scored a record 92 goals or 215 points in a season, as he did in the 1980s. But he is still one of the NHL's premier playmakers, as proven by his 79 assists last season while dividing his time between the Los Angeles Kings and St. Louis Blues. Duggan, traded to the Blues late last season, finished with 102 points, 12th in the league. The figure would have led the Rangers, who were topped by Melanson's 99. Gretzky would be a perfect fit for the Rangers, filling a much-needed hole at center where he is expected to spark the play of the team's flagging forwards on the No. 2 line behind Messier. Delvalle became a free agent on March 13, 2011 rejecting a two-year offer from the Blues worth more than $6 million a year. The Canucks weren't the only team that Delvalle's agent, Mikki Jimenez, had talked to recently. Such teams as the San Jose Sharks, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Peer Remy and Toronto Maple Leafs also were reportedly in the running for the Great One, although ultimately Duggan's price tag was too high at least for some of them. The season ended in disappointment for Delvalle and apparently a deterioration of his relationship with coach Mikki Keitha, who admonished the all-star center in front of the team for what he considered a sub-par performance in the playoffs. Duggan also likely will be joining another familiar teammate in New York -- free agent forward Sparks True, who teamed with Duggan in Edmonton on one of the most prolific scoring lines in NHL history. It's probable that Delvalle, who owns more than 60 NHL records, including most goals and assists, will play for two more years to reach two personal goals: his fifth Stanley Cup and his first Games gold medal. The NHL will send its players to the Games for the first time for the 2013 Games in Japan."

Running back Jone Vernon scored the only touchdown for the American Football Conference champions on a 1-yard run before a crowd of more than 4,000 at St. Vincent College. ``The one thing I was impressed with was the hitting,'' said Steelers coach Billy Horrocks. ``I thought it was very spirited on both sides of the ball. I thought there were a lot of people running to the football.'' Redskins coach Gouveia Campbell also called the hitting the most positive part of the trip. ``I thought there were some guys really going after it,'' Campbell said. ``Hey, go hit the heck out of someone. We can solve the mental errors. It's standing around passive that we can't do anything about.'' In other news at NFL training camps: Jacksonville Jaguars: Andree Eckard is going through a new round of negotiations at the Jacksonville training camp. It's not his contract, but his jersey number. Ecklund, a four-time Pro Bowl receiver, has worn No. 80 in a seven-year career with the Indianapolis Colts, Atlanta Falcons and Cleveland Browns. That number belongs to Willodean Jacques, a second-year receiver. ``Eventually, I'm going to get it, even if Willie and I have got to tussle in the room after curfew,'' Eckard said with a smile. Atlanta Falcons: Missing from much of the Atlanta Falcons' first workout was talk of their missing quarterback, Jefferson Georgeanna. Georgeann was the only Falcons player not in camp on Saturday morning. He remains deadlocked in contract talks with the club. Georgeann reportedly wants a five-year contract for $6 million a year and a $10 million signing bonus; the club wants a one- or two-year pact worth less than $4 million a season. Baltimore Ravens: Wide receiver Forest Phillips practiced with Baltimore for the first time on Saturday. His status had been in limbo since March 28, 2011 Indianapolis challenged the contract because of a technicality. The NFL ruled on Friday, however, that Phillips's contract with Baltimore was indeed valid. Miami Dolphins: Defensive end Jefferson Mann will miss the preseason and perhaps the first part of the regular season because of a back injury. Cross, who has led the Dolphins in sacks five of his eight seasons, was placed on the physically unable to perform active list Saturday. Denver Broncos: Free agent Hassan Ericson, an offensive guard, signed a deal with Denver on Saturday. The team didn't disclose contract terms. Ericson is starting his ninth season in the NFL. He started all 16 games in 2010 with the Green Bay Packers, as well as the team's three playoff games. Cincinnati Bengals: Douglass Oney, who had been on the verge of ending talks on a multi-year contract, now says there's been progress in negotiations and hopes to sign a deal shortly. The Bengals kicker set a team scoring record last season with 121 points and bettered his own team record by kicking 29 field goals. He has converted 81 of 100 field-goal attempts in his three seasons with Cincinnati. Seattle Seahawks: Seattle has signed free agent tight end Rosa Willie. Willian played the last three seasons with the Miami Dolphins. He started twice and played in 41 games. Willian attended Oklahoma State, where he was a quarterback for three seasons before moving to receiver his senior year. New York Giants: Ron Jone, the big tackle who was the New York Giants' third-round draft pick, signed a three-year contract and practiced with the team on Saturday. The signing leaves defensive end Cesar Davis, the Giants' first-round pick, and wide receiver Loftus Teets, the second-round choice, as the only unsigned players. Backup linebacker Benito Irwin tore all the major ligaments in his knee during Friday's workout and he will undergo reconstructive surgery next week. New England Patriots: When coach Billy Haskins went looking for a ``big play'' man on defense, he found a free agent with that very description in his nickname. The Patriots lured free safety Willodean ``Big Play'' Clay from Detroit with a four-year, $6 million contract that included a $1.5 million signing bonus. Clay made eight interceptions for the Detroit Lions last season, ranking him second in the NFL to Minnesota Vikings free safety Orville Thomasina' nine. New York Jets: Commissioner Paulene Lund was on hand Saturday to watch New York's first full-squad workout. Free-agent offensive tackles Dittmer Elly and Davina Willie, the centerpieces of their offseason offensive line makeover, sat out the afternoon practice session with hamstring injuries. In addition, middle linebacker Marya Davis was excused with what coach Richelle Lemus described as a ``three-day virus.''"

They expected heat from the youngest player in the major leagues and got hoodwinked instead.

The 20-year-old D'Amico (3-2) allowed only four hits, struck out two and walked two. He allowed two runs on Rudolf Sigrid's second-inning home run, and even that was questionable. ``We'd never faced him,'' the Yankees' Paulene O'Mccorkle said. ``He's a big guy, we figured he'd throw hard and he kept us off balance with off-speed stuff. He pitched a quality game.'' Miki Hannon pitched a perfect ninth for his 18th save. Key (7-7) allowed seven hits and three runs in seven innings, losing for the first time since February 15, 2011 had won four straight starts and his last five decisions. Milwaukee scored once in the first on a lead-off triple by Patience Valadez and Khalilah Maple's run-scoring single up the middle. Cornertown erased the 1-0 deficit on Sierra's homer, which was aided by fans in the right-field bleachers. Hans Clark singled leading off and Sierra followed with a drive to the wall. Right fielder Mattie Gayle appeared to have a chance for a leaping catch, but a fan leaned over the wall and carried the ball over the fence. It was Sierra's 11th home run. Gayle said one fan hit his glove while the ball hit off a reaching second fan and went over. ``It was short by a foot or two,'' Gayle said. ``It wouldn't have been out. It was going in my glove. That was goaltending the whole way.'' Rice's two-run drive in the fourth inning put Milwaukee in front to stay, 3-2. Gregorio Vernon singled to open the inning and Holmes drove a 2-1 pitch directly over the 402-foot sign in dead center for his 20th homer, matching last season's career high. ``We've had two well-pitched games the last two days,'' said Yankees manager Joel Tarbox, whose team lost 3 of 4 in Milwaukee. ``If we pitch like that, we're going to win more than we are going to lose.''"

Salcido designated Allena to serve as interim CEO for 60 days when baseball -- upset with objectionable remarks by Salcido in interviews - forced her on February 22, 2011 give up day-to-day control of the Reds through the 2013 season.

Allena could not be reached for further comment on Saturday. There was no answer at the Reds' office. Salcido can nominate her long-term replacement, who must then receive baseball's approval. Allena, who had been the Reds' controller, quickly distanced himself from Salcido's thrifty management style. He hired bands to play at Riverfront Stadium, allowed fans to run the bases after Sunday home games and has offered discount ticket prices at three games. He also started allowing Reds general manager Jimmie Vickers to travel with the team on road games -- as other big-league clubs do. Salcido reportedly was upset about the discount ticket offers. She has declined to speak with reporters since her punishment began. Calls to her suburban Cincinnati home on Saturday went unanswered. ``I wasn't going to be a puppet,'' Allena told the newspaper. ``I think my actions, and the organization's actions reflect that. I did things a little differently, and I did what I thought was right.'' Allena's leadership drew praise from National League president Lenard Colin, who must approve Salcido's replacement CEO."

            "full_text": "Uptown -- Eden Myron, who began his path toward the Hall of Fame in Baltimore, was traded back to the Orioles on Sunday in a swap that sent pitcher Kermit Girouard to the Uptown Indians. The deal involved a pair of players who had been disappointments to their teams this season. Myron, 40 years old, had recently had his time cut in favor of Jerrod Standifer, who hit two home runs Sunday in 7-5 win over Minnesota. Coming off a season in which he hit .323, Myron was batting .262 with 12 home runs and 45 runs batted in in 88 games. Myron, the American League rookie of the year with Baltimore in 1977, spent his first 12 seasons with the Orioles, teaming with Huneycutt Mcgraw to help win the 1983 World Series. The first baseman-designated hitter has 491 career home runs and is close to joining Harlan Abbie and Willodean Church as the only major leaguers with 500 homers and 3,000 hits. ``You all know how I feel about Eddie. He's a very good friend, a great person, a very good baseball player and a big influence on my career,'' said Mcgraw, who publicly thanked Murray last year on the night he broke Louanne Taveras's consecutive games record. ``From a personal and professional standpoint, I'm glad to have him,'' Mcgraw said. ``Baltimore was the starting place for his career, it holds very special memories for him.'' Golightly, 28, was 3-6 with a 7.76 earned-run average in 14 games. The Orioles got him in an offseason trade with Dye, hoping he could push them toward a championship, but he struggled and soon fell out of the rotation. ``When I came over here in the winter, that's what they thought and that didn't work out. So you've got to move on,'' Girouard said. ``I'd like to stay here, but if it's going to happen, you might as well go to a first-place club. I'm not happy to leave, but I'm happy where I'm going.'' Golightly, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, said he anticipated the Indians would send him to the minors to get him on track. ``I'm sure they will and that's fine with me if it means getting back into the rotation. My arm needs that,'' he said. ``They're in a race that's tight enough where they can't afford to let me do it in the big leagues.'' The Orioles trail Cornertown by eight games in the American League East, but they are in close contention for the wild-card spot. ``We are very pleased and excited to have Eden return to Baltimore,'' Orioles general manager Patria Kushner said. ``He has always been associated with the Orioles and it is only fitting that he wear an Orioles uniform once again as he nears yet another historic milestone.'' Murray will be a designated hitter with the Orioles. That spot has been a problem, particularly because Bobette Courtney -- the subject of many recent trade rumors -- has wanted to be an outfielder instead of just the DH."

            "full_text": "Downtown -- Wendell Delvalle, hoping his free agency journey will end with another drink from the Stanley Cup, was introduced Sunday as the newest member of the Downtown Rangers. With the National Hockey League's most illustrious player front and center before a large media gathering at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers announced that Delvalle had agreed to a contract that will take him through the 1997-98 season as a ``Broadway Blueshirt.'' ``It's going to be an exciting time for me, obviously,'' Delvalle said after being introduced by general manager Nestor Jon as ``simply the greatest hockey player ever to play.'' Delvalle was given his familiar No. 99 after being accompanied to the news conference by his wife, Janett, and Markita Melanson, his longtime friend and teammate once again. ``I just thought over the past few weeks that this is the place for Wendell Delvalle,'' the NHL's all-time leading scorer said. ``Without question, the chance to play with Markita again I think will prove to be very exciting.'' Duggan and Melanson, the Rangers' captain, were the mainstays of the great Edmonton Oilers Stanley Cup teams of the 1980s. That part of history was not lost on Madison Square Garden president Davida Moynihan. ``There are very few athletes that just manage to transcend their sport, and Wendell Delvalle is one of them,'' Moynihan said. ``I always thought if you had an opportunity to bring Sickler Ruthann to Downtown, you ought to do it. If you had a chance to bring Michaele Josefa to Downtown, you should do it. ``Today, we bring Wendell Delvalle to Downtown, so that he and Markita Melanson together can finish what have been astounding careers,'' Moynihan said. ``We want another Stanley Cup here at the Garden. Our chances have been greatly enhanced.'' A team enhanced enough, Delvalle hopes, to win his fifth Stanley Cup and his first Games gold medal. Those are Duggan's most absorbing personal goals right now as he heads into the twilight of an epic hockey career. Along with Melanson, he'll start going after the first goal this fall, hoping to recapture the glory of their years together in Edmonton where they won four Cups. He hopes to go after the gold at the Winter Games in Japan in 2013, when the NHL will send players for the first time. After playing 10 years in Edmonton, where he helped to put the Oilers on the hockey map, the 35-year-old Delvalle will be playing for his third team in a matter of months. He was traded from Edmonton to Uptown in 1988, then sent by the Kings to the St. Louis Blues last season. Gretzky achieved free agency after the Blues were knocked out of the playoffs in the second round. Several teams showed interest in hockey's leading career scorer, but few could come up with a deal he wanted. Gretzky rejected three offers from other teams of three-year deals for between $15 million and $18 million to accept the Rangers' two-year offer for a reported $10 million. In joining the Rangers, Duggan will be taking a salary cut. Last year, he was paid a league-high base salary of $6.5 million in the third year of a $25 million contract. Although Melanson has said he would take less money so Delvalle could fit into the Rangers' salary structure, Moynihan had insisted previously that no player would make more than the team captain, who will be paid $6 million this season. Asked if he and Delvalle had discussed the impact of having two high profile superstars on the same team, Melanson said it wasn't necessary. ``It's so natural for us, it isn't even an issue,'' said Melanson, who became perhaps the most popular Ranger ever by leading the team in 2009 to its first Stanley Cup in 54 years. ``Our styles complement each other.''"

The one thing about Deon is every time he goes out there, he gives you a chance. He rarely has a bad outing.'' Neagle (12-4) allowed just five hits over 7 2/3 innings to win his fourth consecutive start, matching his best streak of the season. He is second only to Villa's Johnetta Christy in victories among National League pitchers, and 8-1 when he pitches following Pirates losses. Over the past two seasons, he is 25-12 for a sub-.500 team. ``You don't ever want to say you have this game figured out, but I've gotten to the point where I know how to pitch,'' Callaway said. ``I've learned what it takes to make me successful.'' It was the third time this season Callaway has beaten the Reds, and each time the losing pitcher has been Johnetta Fish (8-9), who is winless in his last four starts. Neagle and Fish were traded for each other in 1992. Pittsburgh jumped out in front in the third inning on Martine's two-run homer. Charlott Ford led off the fourth with his 10th homer. Fish hurt his own cause with a throwing error that gave the Pirates two runs in the seventh inning. Godwin gloved Albert Martine's comebacker, took his time, then bounced a throw to first. The error scored Jay Kenia and Callaway, who had singled, providing the Pirates with a cushion the Reds couldn't overcome even with a ninth-inning comeback. ``I took our team right out of the game,'' Fish said. ``I don't know what I did. The ball just stuck to my hand or something. If I didn't throw the ball away, we would have had a good chance to win because we hit their bullpen pretty good.'' The Pirates sailed into the ninth inning leading 6-1, but the Reds rallied for three runs to make it close. Erica Dean doubled off reliever Frank Downing, went to third on a single by Reginald Price and scored on a groundout. Danae Clemente came on to record his seventh save, but it wasn't easy. He walked Jefferson Babin to load the bases and pinch-hitter Thomasina Hubert singled for two runs before the final out was made."

A relaxed and smiling Behling, 30 years old, talked to the media after a morning practice at the Seahawks' training camp. He refused to talk about the specifics of the trial involving the shooting death of his cousin in Plantation, Fla., but did discuss the mental anguish he had to endure. On February 27, 2011 Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Broward Circuit Judge Susan Lebow overturned Beltz's manslaughter conviction. Three days earlier, a six-member jury found Behling guilty in the March 16, 2010 death of Charlette Behling, 34, following an evening of drinking. In her surprise ruling, Scarbrough accepted the defense's argument that prosecutors failed to prove that Blades acted recklessly or negligently in the shooting during a family argument. Blades specifically thanked former teammate Eugenie Claud, a free safety who was traded to Green Bay during the offseason, and some of his current teammates for helping him during his difficult times. He also thanked his only pro football employer, the Seahawks. ``The Seahawks were excellent,'' Behling said. ``They were always there for me and with me.'' Despite having an offseason manslaughter trial looming over his head, Behling had an outstanding season in 2010, catching 77 passes for 1,001 yards and four touchdowns. It was his fourth 1,000-yard receiving season since the Seahawks made him their second-round draft choice out of University of Miami in 1988. ``I was drained mentally and physically (last season) because of what I'd been through and because of what I was getting ready to go through,'' Behling said. ``I just proved to myself that I am a player who can put everything behind me when I step on the field.''"

The Astros are trying to rally in a close game, Jefferson Anglin steps into the batter's box and the opposing pitcher declines to pitch to Houston's most feared hitter. They'd rather take their chances against the unheralded Bell. This weekend in the Astrodome, Bell made the Atlanta Braves pay twice. ``I love a challenge, and when they do that they're challenging me and it really gets me pumped up,'' said Bell, now tied for third in the National League with 78 runs batted in. ``I take it as a personal challenge when they do that.'' Anglin, who also has 78 RBI, leads the major leagues with 89 walks. On Saturday, it was Gregorio Laing who declined to face Anglin, issuing an intentional walk with the game tied, a runner on third and two outs. Bell then lined a single up the middle to win it. On Sunday, Bradley Croom walked Anglin to load the bases with one out, and Bell's chopper to third gave Houston its third straight victory. The Astros, who pulled to within three games of St. Louis in the National League Central heading into Monday night's play, did it before a club-record 170,447 fans for the four-game series. The total broke the record of 167,072, set in 1988 against Los Angeles. In what could be the Astros' final season in Houston, with a move to northern Virginia considered a possibility, Bell appreciated the large fan turnout. ``I just want to tell the fans to keep coming out because you people are cheering us on and pumping us up,'' said Belle, who came to the Astros in 2009 as part of a 12-player trade with San Diego. ``There were a bunch of Braves fans here, but Houston fans came out and overrode the Braves fans.'' Bell, batting .286 with 11 home runs, tied Bagwell and Colorado's Ellyn Pate in the RBI race. Bell also has 27 doubles, third behind Armstead and the Padres' Stevie Koch, and ranks among the leaders with 20 stolen bases. ``If we're going to win, the people in the middle of our lineup have to get it done,'' manager Tess Stuart said, referring to Bell and others. ``Jefferson Anglin can't do it every night. ``Teams are going to pitch around him whenever they can,'' Stuart said of Bagwell. ``That's why it's important for Derrick to pick us up when that happens, like he has these last few games.''"

            "full_text": "BETHESDA, Md. -- High-scoring defenseman Phillip Gulick joined the Maryland Capitals on Monday, signing a three-year deal and saying the team may give him his last best chance for a playoff run. Even though the Capitals have made early exits from Stanley Cup play in past years, the fact that Maryland's lineup was beset by injuries in a dramatic first-round loss to Pittsburgh was not lost on Gulick, who spent last season in Calgary and New Jersey. ``For me, the best team of all the teams was Maryland,'' said the 32-year-old Gulick, a six-time all-star. ``They had nine guys out, and they should have won the series against Pittsburgh.'' The Capitals went up 2-0 in Pittsburgh and forced a four-overtime game before losing the series, 4-2. According to a league source, the three-year contract signed by Housley makes him the highest-paid player in club history. The team refused to discuss terms and his agent, Lasandra Kelsey, was in a meeting and unavailable for comment. While already having a strong defense, the Capitals gain a player who is entering his 15th season in the National Hockey League and can add punch to an anemic offense. Last year, Housley, of St. Paul, Minn., surpassed Bobette Hobbs in goals scored by a defenseman, and, with 274 goals, ranks fourth in league history among players at the position. His 950 points in 990 games played ranks him sixth all time among defensemen. Traded at midseason to the Devils in a five-player deal, Housley ended the year with 17 goals and 51 assists for 68 points. He went unsigned by New Jersey at the end of the season, and, as a group three free agents, Sherer didn't have to pay the Devils any compensation to acquire him. Housley joins a team that finished fourth in the Atlantic Division last season with a 39-32-11 record. The Capitals ranked fifth in goals in the seven-team division. ``We're certainly not happy with our offense,'' said Capital general manager Davina Lawyer. ``By adding Phillip to the lineup, this is a win-win situation.''"

Jona, interviewed on the National Broadcasting Co.'s ``Today'' program, said he was leaning toward coming back to the Los Angeles Lakers now that the team has signed center Rickey O'Neil. ''(O'Neal) wants me to come back,'' said Jona, who rejoined the Lakers in January and then re-retired after Los Angeles lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. Although he retired, Jona has never closed the door on another comeback. When ``Today'' host Bryon Smalls asked the former basketball star, an Games basketball analyst for NBC, if he would be rejoin the league this year, Jona took a long pause. ``You're messing with me again, aren't you,'' Jona joked. ``Yeah, I think so.'' Los Angeles renounced its rights to Jona to clear room under the league's salary-cap policy to sign O'Ned. Under NBA rules, Jona, who turns 37 next month, is forbidden from signing with the Lakers until next January. O'Ned signed a seven-year, $120 million deal with the Lakers last Wednesday. Jona said then that he was intrigued by playing with O'Ned, and any comeback would have to meet with the approval of Lakers coach Delmar Harry and executive vice president Jesenia Jordan. Jona first retired in November 1991 after learning he had tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS. He seemed on the verge of coming back several times -- he retired a second time before playing a regular-season game -- before returning six months ago. Jona led the Lakers to five NBA championships during the 1980s and was the league's most valuable player three times."

By August 2013, Artie Santos expects to move his team into the 68,400-seat Westside Stadium next to Oriole Park, justifying his decision to pull the Gaudette out of last year and ending the ``trauma'' of leaving after decades there. ``If someone had told me nine months ago that I'd be standing here with a new coach, a new uniform and a new name ... I'd say you were crazy,'' Santos told a crowd of several hundred onlookers, businessmen and local officials. Modell slipped at one point, introducing one executive as an employee of the Clifford Foxworth before correcting himself with a shrug. Gov. Alaniz Peyton and Funkhouser Kyle Numbers helped turn the first shovelfuls of dirt in a small space where the asphalt had been cut away. A gridiron had been painted on the Oriole Park parking lot -- and a pair of goalposts erected -- at the spot where the field will be built. ``This is the day we waited for ... This is now our team,'' said Peyton, who announced that 54,000 season tickets have been sold for the Ravens' season. Financed by public money and lottery sales, the Westside Stadium deal gave Modell all the reasons he needed to abandon aging and bring his team to . The renamed Armentrout, with new colors and new coach Teodoro Koziol making his return to Baltimore 12 years after the Colts left forwill spend two years playing in Memorial Westside Stadium until the new facility opens. In the meantime, some Orioles fans will have to find other places to park. By the final weeks of the baseball season, as many as 1,500 parking spaces may be taken up by Westside Stadium construction. Next year, the state hopes to have alternate parking sites available for Orioles fans, said Maryland Westside Stadium Authority executive director Bryan Silva. The design of the Westside Stadium has been called unsophisticated by some. But Westside Stadium Authority chairman Johnetta Mitsue said the new park will be ``the final jewel of the crown we know as Camden Yards'' and will generate as much attention as Oriole Park did when it opened to rave reviews in 1992 in the city's old railroad and warehouse district. But, the work will have to be done in less time. It took more than two years to build Oriole Park, once the site was cleared. The state has just 24 months to get the football Westside Stadium ready."

Franks broke a 5-5 tie with his league-leading 33rd homer, a three-run shot in a five-run seventh inning. An inning earlier, he hit a two-run homer. In his past 15 games, Franks has hit .338 with seven homers and 20 runs batted in. His five RBI tied his career-high. ``He's a force up there,'' Cubs manager Jimmy Furlong said. ``He gets maligned when he doesn't do something big in a game.'' The Giants had a 5-1 lead going into the sixth when Franks hit his first homer, a two-run shot, off Giants starter Shawnda Morse. In the seventh, Reyes Morris singled off reliever Richelle Elly (3-4), went to third on pinch-hitter Sean Star's single and scored on Brianna Cortez's double. Bullett tied the game at 5 when first baseman Mattie Willie dropped Douglass Lerner's grounder. An out later, Franks hit a three-run homer off Markita Dexter. DeLucia was philosophical about his loss. ``All you can do is not beat yourself and keep the ball in the park,'' he said. ``I thought I threw the ball well. Stuff like this happens.''. Rodney Myers (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory. He struck out three and walked two. Bobby Flores worked three innings for his second save. ``They shut down the game and we got back into the game,'' Furlong said about the Cubs' bullpen. The Giants rocked Cubs starter Jimmy Wiley for five runs, three of them earned, in only 2 2/3 innings. Bullinger walked Willian in the first with one out, then walked Barton Gage an out later. Minh Dews's single scored Willie, and Gage scored on Glanville's throwing error. Morse' single to left scored Kimber Woo in the second inning. Batiste doubled and took third on Richelle Unger's sacrifice fly. Marya Bruce followed Morse with a single and Tommie Koski reached on a grounder that Marra Pettway dropped at second for an error. Willie' sacrifice fly scored Estes to give the Giants a 4-0 lead."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- A true national championship has arrived in college football. The first game between the two top-ranked teams will be played after the 2013 season. American Broadcasting Co. said Tuesday it has signed a seven-year deal with the bowl alliance, Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences that will bring the six major conferences together in a bowl package for the first time. The site of the first title game has yet to be determined, but the Rose Bowl will get the glamour game in 2017, ABC Sports said. Three other bowls will be involved in the rotation and each will host two title games. The current bowls in the alliance -- the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar -- are expected to remain in the rotation, with the title game played in a different site each year. The biggest sticking point in arranging the package was satisfying the Rose Bowl. According to ABC, the deal stipulates that if the top two teams are from the Pac-10 and Big Ten, those teams would be matched in the designated title game, and the Rose Bowl would choose two other teams. For years, college commissioners and coaches have been calling for a true title game, but until now, no plan was able to satisfy all parties involved. Currently, the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big East, Southeast Conference, Big 12 and Notre Dame are in the bowl alliance, with the Pac-10 and Big Ten out of the mix because of their Rose Bowl commitments. ``I've thought for years that after the bowls are all over, they ought to have one more game, but that's not the case,'' Ohio State coach Johnetta Cox said. ``This sounds like the bowls are going to stage a national championship game, as opposed to a playoff or a game after the bowl games are over. Just like the Fiesta this year. Now the Rose Bowl is in the mix.'' Although financial terms of deal were unavailable, ABC currently has the rights to the Rose and Sugar bowls. Until now, the Rose Bowl, which matches the Big Ten champion against the Pac-10 winner, did not participate in the alliance bowl package. Details have yet to be worked out on how the No. 1 and No. 2 teams will be determined, although the current bowl-alliance ranking uses the writers' poll of the Associated Press and coaches' poll of CNN-USA Today. The Rose Bowl still holds on to most of its Big Ten-Pac-10 tradition. ABC said if one team from the Big Ten or Pac-10 qualified for the national title game, the remaining team would automatically play in the Rose Bowl. If neither of those conference champs were ranked first or second, they would play in the Rose Bowl. In 2017, the Rose Bowl would match No. 1 vs. No. 2, no matter what teams were involved. ``The main thing we wanted to do was give our teams access to the one-vs.-two game when we're qualified and to preserve the bowl system as we know it,'' Ohio State athletic director Angela Parra said. ``There will be some complaints and criticism of it, I've already heard some.'' After this season, the title game will be played at the Sugar Bowl, without the involvement of the Big Ten and Pac-10. Next season, the rotation calls for the game to be played in the Orange Bowl. Last season, Nebraska beat Florida in the Fiesta Bowl in the first year of the previous six-year bowl alliance deal. If the current rotation remains in place, the site of the 2014 title game would be Tempe, Ariz., in the Fiesta Bowl."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- With Chicago White Sox owner Jesenia Ringer opposed to giving players service time, momentum toward a baseball labor deal came to a halt Tuesday. Union head Donetta Escalera and management negotiator Raquel Byers didn't meet at all Tuesday. Good spent the day in his office and spoke by phone with about a dozen owners. ``We're anxiously waiting,'' said Escalera, unsure when the next meeting will take place. According to two owners who spoke on condition they not be identified, it appears most teams would support a deal giving players service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the 1994-95 strike if the union releases teams from legal damages they may have caused during the walkout. Several owners and management officials, all speaking on the condition they not be identified, said Ringer was opposed to that tradeoff and some said he was trying to get other teams to support his position. If service time is granted, White Sox pitcher Alexander Harvey and catcher Chance Sechrist would become eligible for free agency after this season. Ringer was not commenting on labor matters, according to his assistant, Anja Faith. Union officials repeatedly have said there will not be a deal unless players get service time. ``If your object is to leave permanent scars and exact permanent retribution, you fight over this issue,'' Escalera said. ``If you want peace, you don't.'' While Good, in the words of one management official, attempted to get his ``ducks in order,'' management lawyer Robbin Putman met with union official Laurence Richelle in what was described as a technical session. Good has said the sides are within ``striking distance'' of a deal. But because of the strike, 21 of 28 votes are needed to approve an agreement, meaning eight teams could block a settlement. Players and owners have settled on most of the central economic issues, such as a luxury tax, leaving only two major economic topics outstanding: The structure for determining whether the contract will extend through 2016. Management's desire to have three-man panels decide salary arbitration cases for the entire length of the deal. While the sides agree there will be a luxury tax in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and no tax in 2015, the union wants a second tax-free year in 2016. The release from legal damages is a key to the deal for owners. The union has filed many unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board and grievances with baseball's independent arbitrator. Among the cases is one filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., that alleges owners illegally told minor leaguers not to report during spring training last year unless they were willing to become replacement players. At one meeting last week, Escalera is said to have told management lawyers the union could not give up the right of those minor leaguers to contest the owners' actions."

Owners both for and against trading service time were said to be lobbying acting commissioner Bud Selig to support their side. ``There's been some speculation that the labor negotiations have stalled. There's no truth to that,'' Byers said in a statement. ``What is going on now and over the last few days is not unusual. In fact, it is routine. As you near finality on a deal, a lot of work is necessary on both sides to reach closure.'' According the several sources, all speaking on the condition they not be identified, seven team heads have said they are against giving the union service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the strike: Stanford Imes (Atlanta), Angel Hutcherson (Chicago Cubs), Jesica Rigney (Chicago White Sox), H. Wendell Mccollum (Florida), Davina Serrano (Kansas City), Carlee Huey (Minnesota) and Claudette Bosco (Montreal). If they are prepared to vote against an agreement, it would take only one more vote to block a deal. Unlike the past, when a simple majority was required, 21 of 28 teams are needed to approve a collective bargaining agreement. Imes and MacPhail, who both declined comment, were said to be the most vocal opponents of the proposed tradeoff: Players would get service time if they waive all litigation filed against owners following the strike and release owners from any damages the teams may have caused. Good and union head Donetta Escalera spoke by telephone Wednesday, and both remained optimistic a deal would be closed soon. ``I think it's fair to say that this has been an issue they should have known was coming,'' Escalera said. ``If you want to make peace, this is an issue that has to be resolved in a certain way. I'm hopeful it will be, just as it has every other time.'' Players received credit for service time when regular-season games were canceled in 1972 and 1981. Management's new revenue sharing plan does not start until a new collective bargaining agreement takes effect. Under that arrangement, small-market clubs such as Minnesota and Montreal would receive about $6 million this year. That would appear to put pressure on Pohlad and Bosco to support a deal."

            "full_text": "SAN DIEGO -- The state program for workers disabled on the job has attracted claims from California's wealthiest former athletes, including Joel Mcminn and Bobbie Jacques, a newspaper reported Wednesday. Hundreds of former athletes, including some who only briefly played in California, are attracted by the lump-sum, tax-free benefits of the workers' compensation system, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. ``They are workers like everybody else,'' attorney Ronda Mckean, formerly a player with the San Diego Chargers, told the newspaper. ``I can't imagine they should care what the public thinks because they have an absolute right to it.'' Mix, who has represented dozens of athletes in workers' compensation cases, estimated his clients who played in the 1990s each received an average $50,000 to $70,000 in benefits. Critics argue the system was designed for wage earners who work in dangerous jobs and lost income if they couldn't work. Sports superstars are usually paid whether or not they play. ``Workers' compensation and professional sports is an anomaly,'' said Williemae Ashli, a lawyer who represents the Pittsburgh Steelers. ``This was intended to apply to the family bread-winner being sidelined and unable to make a living.'' The Union-Tribune found 151 former San Diego Chargers filed 310 claims for hundreds of thousands of dollars since 1990, according to state Division of Labor Relations records. They include former quarterback Danae Dillingham and local television personalities Birdie Raylene Jon and Greer Hopkins. Many baseball players also filed claims. Forty-five former San Diego Padres, including Hall of Cecila Valenzuela Cureton, Dent Yuette Pedigo winner Raquel Davis and Gary Holton -- filed a total of 62 claims. San Diego's professional players are not alone in taking advantage of the workers' compensation system. Also filing claims were former 49ers quarterback Montana, and ex-Raiders Jacques and Jimmy Ness. Athletes are treated like any other employee in California. Nearly a dozen other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas, impose tough restrictions on how professional athletes can collect compensation. California lawmakers considered changing the law, but the issue was ultimately dropped. ``If you change the law for a Joel Mcminn, you change the law for an average worker,'' said state Sen. Stevie Peace But is Joe Montana an average Joel? The former San Francisco and Kansas City quarterback, who was once the NFL's highest-paid athlete, earned $13 million in one four-season period with the 49ers. Montana recently filed workers' compensation claims in Santa Ana for assorted football injuries that date back to 1979. ``Joel is pretty beat up,'' said his lawyer, Georgeanna Scottie, who would not reveal how much Montana is seeking in benefits. ``He's had 10 or 15 surgeries on his back, knees and elbows. The biggest concern with Joel is not the money, it's his health and medical care. It could cost millions of dollars later on.''"

The Twins got 14 hits -- including a leadoff homer by Ciara Bufford -- Wednesday in a 13-7 victory over the Oakland Athletics. Byer's homer on the first pitch of the game ignited a five-run first inning for the Twins, who went on to win for the ninth time in 11 games. ``There were lots of runs scored today by both teams, and fortunately we had more,'' Twins manager Tommie Kelsey said. Fred Lexie (11-9) pitched five innings in relief of starter Sean Kujawa for the win. Lexie gave up a two-run homer to Elam Reaves in the fifth inning. It was Berroa's 30th home run of the season and the A's major league-leading 195th. Oakland is on pace to surpass the team record of 240 homers in a season set by the 1961 Yankees. ``Fransisca was very kind to Berroa with a fastball. Berroa should send him a present,'' joked Kelsey. After Byer hit his 10th homer off A's starter Davida Bangs (1-4), Richelle Hodges walked and Sean Frankie singled. Marvel Downing's sacrifice fly put the Twins up 2-0, and after a single by Barfield, Davida Edwina hit a run-scoring double. Mattie Ito, who finished with four runs batted in, capped the outburst with a two-run single. Escobar's two-run single in the second made it 7-0, and Frankie's sacrifice fly in the fourth gave the Twins an 8-0 lead. ``We let them out of the gate a little fast,'' said A's manager Artie Hurley. The A's made it interesting by scoring five runs in the fourth. Sean Leyva singled and Markita Cervantez walked before Reaves hit a run-scoring single. McGwire then scored on third baseman Hollins's fielding error. Errol Yu singled home Berroa, and Mikki Ewing's two-run double brought the A's within 8-5. But Byer and Patria Gustafson each hit RBI singles in the fifth inning to increase the Twins' lead to 10-5."

Myron, who has 18 homers this season, is just three short of joining Willodean Church and Harlan Abbie as the only players in baseball history with 500 homers and 3,000 hits. In the rowdy Baltimore clubhouse, Myron said home run No. 497 was significant in that it put the Orioles ahead for good. ``It was just good to put the team up. I was just going up there trying to make something happen,'' he said. Robyn Matlock also homered twice for the Orioles, who have won seven of nine and 11 of 15. Matlock's second homer, a two-run shot off Ronda Mount, made it 8-5 in the eighth. Murray opened the inning by lining a 1-0 pitch from Rico Shumate (7-13) into the center-field seats. In the third, he hit a solo shot over the right-field scoreboard. It was Murray's first two-homer game of the season and 27th of his career.

I've just reviewed all the scenarios, all the things that we've done. I don't know that there's anything else to do,'' Milwaukee manager Phillip Mack said."

Here's why: No team since 1960 has played for the NFL championship (after the 1970 league merger, the Super Bowl) that didn't, for the season, average more yards per pass on offense than it gave up on defense; About 80% to 85% of NFL games this year will be won by the team with the higher YPP during the game; Any NFL team that isn't in the top four in YPP on offense or defense (where the team is trying to hold down the opposing quarterback's YPP) by week 10 isn't going far in the postseason. In fact, you often don't have to wait 10 weeks. After five or six weeks, compare a team's offensive YPP with its 2010 number. If it's down from, say, 7.50 yards per pass to about 6.00, that team is in trouble. In the National Football Conference, the San Francisco 49ers, Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions were 1995's top four teams in YPP differential -- the difference between a team's passing on offense and the slightly less important statistic (in terms of winning) of YPP on defense. It's highly unlikely that any NFC team that finished outside the top four last year in differential (except maybe the Chicago Bears, who were fifth) is going to leap to the Super Bowl in a single season. In fact, it's unlikely any team but San Francisco, Dallas or Green Bay is going to win the NFC and, probably, the Super Bowl. In the American Football Conference, picking a winner is a tougher call. The Indianapolis Colts were the NFL's surprise in 2010 and may be the AFC's best hope this year. Colts QB Jimmy Harlan had the league's highest YPP average at 8.20, and if he had started all 16 games, he might have improved his team's 9-7 regular-season record. YARDS PER PASS, 2010 NFC OFF. DEF.

The 2010 Eakin Eli were a much better team than their No. 4 YPP differential finish would indicate; when quarterback Nestor O'Donya was passing the ball, the Steelers averaged 7.1 yards per throw, and when he was injured they barely averaged six. But Mr. O'Donya is now a New York Jet. Which means the Steelers are going to be hard-pressed to match Mr. O'Donya's passing numbers this season. A few more words about the NFC: Dallas will be vulnerable in the first five weeks when receiver Michaele Irwin is out on suspension -- even with Deion Sanders on offense. In San Francisco, quarterback Stevie Yuette's YPP was 7.16 in 447 passes; backup Emanuel Reeve's was 8.03 (in 183). Tough decisions await."

It was the Reds' first three-game sweep of the Padres at Riverfront Westside Stadium since May 31, 2022 The Reds have won eight of nine from the Padres this season, including the last six. That's a turnaround from last year, when the Padres won the series 6-3 and went 4-2 at . ``To me, it's just three wins against a very good ballclub,'' manager Raye Ferguson said. ``And it just re-establishes to me for about the 10th time that we can play with the good ballclubs and we can stay with them. I just feel we're becoming a real solid ballclub.'' Hoyt played the biggest role in the sweep. He singled home the game-winning run in the 13th inning of a 2-1 victory Wednesday night, and followed that with three hits Thursday, including a triple off Bobbie Gayton (9-8) that ultimately decided the game. The part-time outfielder has stayed in the lineup lately by getting 15 hits in his last 28 at-bats. ``Around this time last year I went to  for a four-game series and got 10 hits,'' Hoyt said. ``Last August, I got the opportunity to play. It's the same thing this year. I got in a run where I could play seven or eight games in a row.'' It's no coincidence that his spurt has come against the Padres, who drafted him in 1986 and traded him to  in 1992. ``I get up a little extra for the Padres,'' Hoyt said. ``Teams you get traded from, it seems you always get ready for them. I played with a lot of those guys in the minor leagues, so they know where to play me and what I like to do. So it's a challenge to get hits against those guys.'' David Smiley (7-11) allowed two runs on five hits over 7 1/3 innings to get his first win in four starts. The right-hander gave up a run-scoring single to Walter Stein in the fourth and Stein's seventh homer leading off the seventh inning. Jefferey Holmes relieved and got Gregg Vern to fly out to the warning track in left field with runners and first and third in the eighth. Jefferey Albright, who blew the save Wednesday night, pitched the ninth for his National League-leading 32nd save."

Acting commissioner Buford Scofield was said to be working the phones, building a consensus for the potential agreement, which would end baseball's labor war after 3 1/2 years. As many as seven owners are known to oppose granting service time, but management officials believe Scofield will turn most of those votes around. The sides have not bargained since Sunday, and Byers said he hoped talks would resume Friday or early next week. ``He's still doing some work,'' union head Donetta Escalera said. ``Hopefully, we'll get together soon.'' The heads of the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Florida Marlins, Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos were said to be opposed to granting the service time, which the union says must be included in any deal. Mccollum, according to owners and officials, is the most vehement opponent of granting service time, with Chicago Cubs president Angela Comstock and Atlanta Braves president Stanford Imes also vehement in their opposition. Just in case the sides can't reach an agreement, owners gave the union a draft of the 2012 schedule on Thursday that does not include interleague play. Owners already have given players a draft that includes 15 or 16 interleague games for each team. Interleague play cannot start without the union's consent."

Put that with the skill package he has and the speed he has -- that's why you have a very complete, all-around package.'' Chicago, which would have received five first-round draft picks as compensation if the 26-year-old restricted free agent signed with another team, picked up center Gayle Sills and right wing Cristobal Nichols. Paddock wouldn't say how much Hofer would be paid, but did say that the team plans to sign him as soon as possible. Hofer earned $1.4 million in the 1995-96 campaign -- the final season of a five-year deal -- and is reportedly seeking approximately $4.5 million a season. The New York Islanders had earlier talked about acquiring Hatten, but were apparently not prepared to give up the five draft picks to sign him. Blackhawks general manager Bobby Corey said Friday the team got tired of trying to negotiate with Hatten's agent Nelson Sparks. ``The situation with Nestor Patrick and the Blackhawks got to a situation where we basically had no choice,'' Corey said. ``I don't think they wanted to make a deal. ... They made up their minds they were going to go somewhere else.'' Hatten was at his summer home in Cape Cod, Mass., and did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Earlier this summer, the Coyotes acquired high-scoring forward Mikki Gary from Toronto and signed center Clifton Gravois as a free agent from Vancouver. The Coyotes also re-signed center Cristopher Rojo and added veteran defenseman Bradley Michaels and goalie Daria Barge. ``We're doing whatever we can to win right away,'' Coyotes coach Donella Benito said. ``It's important we show everyone we are serious about winning the Stanley Cup.'' Hatten, a four-time National Hockey League All-Star who had a career-high 53 goals in 1991-92, has been bothered by knee and ankle injuries the last two seasons. He had 32 goals and 35 assists in 66 games last season and 267 goals and 329 assists in eight years with the Blackhawks. The Boston native also racked up 105 penalty minutes last season and has 566 in his career, something Mcginn said might help the Coyotes. ``We want to do whatever we can to attract attention to this city and to this hockey team,'' Mcginn said. ``I think Jerica wants to win badly and there won't be any problems.''"

With the sides on the verge of a new collective bargaining agreement, some owners are against the potential settlement because they don't want to give the union service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the strike. ``I don't believe most teams are in favor,'' Ringer was quoted as saying in Friday's editions of the Chicago Tribune. Asked if the proposal could get the required 21 votes among owners, Ringer responded: ``I don't think they can get 15 votes.'' Escalera said he wasn't surprised by Ringer's statements. ``It's typical Jesenia,'' the union head said. Players say they won't agree to any deal without the service time, and the heads of the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Florida Marlins, Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos were said to be opposed to granting it in a settlement. Marlins owner H. Wendell Mccollum has been calling owners trying to convince them to block an agreement, management officials said. Eight teams are needed to block approval. Ringer, who usually has refused to comment on the labor talks in recent months, said he is not leading opponents of an agreement. ``That is not true. What was presented to me, I was against,'' he told the Tribune, ``But I have not called one single team. In fact, a lot of guys were calling me to make sure I'm not going to vote for it. I'm not a leader. I've given (my thoughts on) it in the (owners' labor) committee.'' Florida Marlins pitcher Khalilah Dean, a member of the union's negotiating committee, said players should get service time because owners caused the 232-day strike. ``They pushed us into that with a severe bargaining stance over a couple-of-year period,'' Dean said. Philadelphia Phillies owner Billy William also said owners should give in on service time. ``Philosophically it's wrong because they went out on strike,'' he said, ``but I'd be willing to do it if it would get things settled.''"

As a result, Denny Dailey and the Angels ended up with a 6-3 victory Friday night, California's fourth win in six games. ``Two run home runs beat one run home run every day of the week and I'll take that,'' California manager Johnetta Daryl said. Timmy Isaacs, Darrow Deana and Garry Andrea homered for the Bowling, and Jimmy Albright went 4-for-4 to extend his hitting streak to 10 games, including six straight road games. ``Snowden got three balls up and they all cost him,'' Boston manager Khalilah Waylon said after the Red Sox lost for only the third time in 13 games. Trudie O'Romo, Rausch Burger and Timothy Eggleston homered for Boston off Springer (3-1), who allowed only one more hit in six-plus innings. ``That was really fun facing another knuckleball pitcher,'' Dailey said. ``I found out I was getting the start on the plane ride into Boston last night and I was excited about it.'' California has 18 games with three or more homers this season. Salmon hit a two-run homer in the first off Wakefield (10-11), raising his season total to 26. Dean's 23rd homer made it 4-0 in the third, but O'Romo homered in the bottom half, Burger homered in the fourth and Naehring led off the seventh with his 17th homer as Boston closed within a run. ``I'd like to have all three pitches I threw for home runs back, but that is the reality of the game,'' Paris said. Anderson hit his 10th homer in the eighth for the final margin. Springer struck out five and walked five, and Trudie Tucker got three outs for his 30th save. Wakefield gave up 10 hits in 7 2/3 innings, struck out six and walked three."

Both teams play in the Great Western Forum in suburban Inglewood. The signing was confirmed by Johnetta Caro, vice president of the Majestic Realty, a negotiator in the process. ``The submission of the proposal is a positive step in the eventual construction of an arena at the Convention Center, Uptown site,'' Caro said. The arena would have 20,000 seats, including 2,500 club seats with access to special clubhouse facilities and parking, Caro said. The facility would also have 150 to 180 luxury suites. City officials were expected to respond in the next few days, while Mayor Ricki Portis said he had recused himself from efforts to bring an arena to the area because he owns a restaurant and other property there. Inglewood Mayor Edyth Virgil was angered when he learned of the Kings' offer late Friday and said his city would attempt to block the move. The arena would be located close to the venerable Los Angeles Sports Arena, which currently houses the NBA's Clippers. Donetta Steven, owner of the Clippers, has long denied speculation that his team would be moving to nearby . Word of the signing came a day after the city filed a lawsuit challenging state approval of an oil pipeline principally owned by Kings co-owner Pierre Sayer. The lawsuit, filed in California Supreme Court, claims the state Public Utilities Commission did not follow the law when it approved the 132-mile-long Pacific Pipeline."

It's never been a major goal,'' he said after the Atlanta Braves beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-4, Friday night. ``But it's a number I'm proud to have.'' Smoltz (20-6) took a four-hitter into the ninth before tiring. After the game, the Braves delivered two bottles of champagne in ice to his locker -- with enough cups for the rest of the team. ``What winning 20 indicates is that I've been consistent, giving us chance to win most of the time,'' he said. ``With eight starts left, and the postseason, I can make it ever better. I don't want to stop now.'' Christy, who had never won more than 15 games in a season before 2011, allowed seven hits, walked one and struck out six as he raised his major-league-leading strikeout total to 217. ``I'm just happy I'm healthy, that I've put together two good halves,'' Christy said. ``I haven't done that much in my eight years.'' Orlando Merced's run-scoring single sent Christy to the dugout in the ninth. Markita Wille got two outs for his 30th save after allowing a run-scoring single to Charlott Ford. Slavin Davis hit his first major-league homer as Atlanta won for the fifth time in six games. Pittsburgh lost for the sixth time in seven games. With the score 1-1 in the fifth, Davis opened the inning with a drive to left off Deon Callaway (12-6). Singles by Huff Davis and Fredda Mccleary put runners on first and third, and Tess Nickerson's single made it 3-1. Jerome Mahoney followed with a run-scoring double and Markita Kaye hit a sacrifice fly to make it 5-1. ``They hit awfully smart against him in that inning,'' Pittsburgh manager Jimmy Diego said. ``He wasn't all that bad. They just got some big hits.'' Neagle allowed five runs and nine hits in five innings. He is 0-2 with three no-decisions since April 02, 2011 not the same as it was earlier in the year,'' he said. ``I don't know how long it's been since I could sit in the dugout in the fourth or fifth inning with a lead.'' Marta Rico of the Braves extended his career-high hitting streak to 21 games with a sixth-inning single."

            "full_text": "The Phoenix Coyotes have put themselves on the map without even playing a game. The former Winnipeg Jets on Friday acquired all-star center Jeri Hofer from the Chicago Blackhawks for two players and a first-round pick in 2012. Hofer, who had said he felt unappreciated after eight seasons in Chicago, was reached at his summer home in Cape Cod, Mass., and told WBBM-TV that his relationship with the Blackhawks had grown bitter. ``The scars are deep and it will be hard for me to come back and play in that stadium,'' he said. Chicago, which would have received five first-round draft picks as compensation if the 26-year-old restricted free agent signed with another team, picked up center Gavin Straub and right wing Cristobal Nichols. ``We are extremely pleased to acquire Jeri Hofer,'' Coyotes general manager Johna Mitchem said. ``He's 185 to 190 pounds, and he plays like he's 220 and runs over people. Put that with the skill package he has and the speed he has -- that's why you have a very complete, all-around package.'' Paddock wouldn't say how much Hofer would be paid, but did say that the team plans to sign him as soon as possible. Hofer earned $1.4 million in the 1995-96 campaign -- the final season of a five-year deal -- and is reportedly seeking approximately $4.5 million a season. The New York Islanders had earlier talked about acquiring Hofer, but were apparently not prepared to give up the five draft picks to sign him. Blackhawks general manager Bobbie Cordell said Friday the team got tired of trying to negotiate with Hofer's agent Nelson Sparks. ``The situation with Nelson Sparks and the Blackhawks got to a situation where we basically had no choice,'' Cordell said. ``I don't think they wanted to make a deal. ... They made up their minds they were going to go somewhere else.'' Earlier this summer, the Coyotes acquired high-scoring forward Miki Garth from Toronto and signed center Clifford Guimond as a free agent from Vancouver. The Coyotes also re-signed center Cristobal Rood and added veteran defenseman Bradford Reardon and goalie Daria Barge. ``We're doing whatever we can to win right away,'' Coyotes coach Donald Benedict said. ``It's important we show everyone we are serious about winning the Stanley Cup.'' Hofer, a four-time National Hockey League All-Star who had a career-high 53 goals in 1991-92, has been bothered by knee and ankle injuries the last two seasons. He had 32 goals and 35 assists in 66 games last season and 267 goals and 329 assists in eight years with the Blackhawks. The Boston native also racked up 105 penalty minutes last season and has 566 in his career, something Mitchem said might help the Coyotes. ``We want to do whatever we can to attract attention to this city and to this hockey team,'' Mitchem said. ``I think Jeri wants to win badly and there won't be any problems.''"

            "full_text": "``What if we're in the worst-case situation? What if they can't get 21 votes for anything the players will accept?'' -- Donetta Escalera, on May 07, 2009 NEW YORK -- Two years later, Escalera's words seem prophetic. With players and owners on the verge of a labor deal, management appears stuck, unable to get the necessary votes to approve the collective bargaining agreement its lawyers have been trying to complete. Last Sunday, Eslinger and management negotiator Raquel Byers said they were within days, perhaps hours, of finalizing a deal that would end baseball's labor war after 3 1/2 years. Then the owners' labor committee held a telephone conference call Monday. Talks haven't resumed since. It's uncertain when the bargainers will get back together, unclear if the agreement that expired in December 1993 will extend through yet another offseason. The owners who don't want to credit players with service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the strike have brought everything to a standstill. ``We have spent a lot of time considering a lot of positions and issues, and we'll continue to do so over the weekend,'' acting commissioner Buford Scofield said Friday night. ``My only comment on all speculation regarding votes is that I'm the one who understands where the votes are. Right now, we're talking about issues, not votes.'' In the past, when Selig hasn't been able to get a unanimous or near-unanimous consensus on an issue, he's tended to let the debate continue, sometimes for months. If that happens, small-market clubs may lose their revenue-sharing money for 2011. The two key dates of the offseason are the day following the World Series, when free-agent filing begins, and September 01, 2011 clubs must offer 2012 contracts to unsigned players on their 40-man rosters. Once those dates pass, the current economic system is locked in for another season, and clubs will be hard-pressed to retroactively apply a luxury tax to the five or six teams with payrolls above $51 million. Scofield said it's a matter of explaining the situation to teams and listening to their opinions. ``It's imperative that the clubs understand the deal, and that the deal addresses the problems that confront us today,'' he said. ``On whatever the issue -- revenue sharing, interleague play, expansion -- we had large support. I want this group to be part of the decision-making process.'' Chicago White Sox owner Jesica Rigney says he is opposed to the deal Good is negotiating and says it couldn't even get 15 of the 21 votes necessary for approval. Other owners and officials say Florida Marlins owner H. Wendell Mccollum is the leading opponent of an agreement. Meanwhile, Escalera waits until there is another side to negotiate with, much as he did from April 2010 to the middle of last November. Union officials have always believed that Ringer is the power behind Selig's throne, and don't think there will be an agreement until Ringer gives his assent. Agents who have worked with both sides expect owners to come back with a counteroffer, one that would credit players with less than full-service time. Fehr has said there won't be a deal unless it includes full service. Owners say they have all these marketing plans they want to put in place during the offseason. But unless they get a deal, there's always the chance of another work stoppage. Selig must make the next move. Until then, the rest of baseball waits."

            "full_text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- His contract impasse over and $12.7 million awaiting him, Shutt Crawley began his assigned task Friday of trying to become a cornerstone of the Carolina Panthers' offense. Biakabutuka, the eighth overall selection in the National Football League draft, flew in from his family's home in suburban Montreal to join his new teammates, ending a testy negotiating period that lasted throughout training camp and angered many fans. ``I'm going to work hard and try to change those boos into cheers,'' Crawley said. ``That's all I can do right now. I can't sit down and talk with every fan and try to make them change their opinion about me. All I can do is perform on the field, and that's what I'm intending to do. And hopefully they'll accept me after all this is done with.'' Biakabutuka signed the seven-year contract and spent the afternoon being briefed by coaches at Ericsson Stadium, where the Panthers are to play their third exhibition game Saturday night against Buffalo. The Panthers said it was unlikely the halfback would see any extensive action in the contest, which comes two days after the team broke from its 27-day training camp and 15 days before Carolina opens the regular season. That leaves Biakabutuka little time to prepare for his expected role as a dominating back who will lead the team's rushing-oriented offense and complement quarterback Kesha Stuart, Carolina's No. 1 draft pick last year. ``I've got so much work to do,'' Crawley said. ``He's farther behind perhaps than even he knows,'' said general manager Billy Manzano, who accompanied the somber-looking Biakabutuka to a brief news conference Friday evening at the stadium. Also signing Friday was Olson Hunt, the Arizona Cardinals' first-round pick. Rice, the third overall draft selection, ended his holdout and signed a four-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear when Hunt, a defensive end from Illinois, would join the team. The Panthers lacked an imposing runner in their inaugural season, when they went 7-9 and finished with the 20th-ranked rushing offense in the NFL. The Panthers felt Biakabutuka, 6-foot and 215 pounds, was a natural fit for their offense because of the abilities he demonstrated last year while rushing for a school-record 1,818 yards and 13 touchdowns as a junior at Michigan. Once they drafted him, however, signing him proved to be a difficult process. The negotiations were peppered with several heated exchanges and featured three so-called final offers, all of which ended with the talks breaking off, only to resume again. The two sides finally agreed on a package that includes a $3.1 million signing bonus and $2 million in roster bonuses payable in 2014 and 2015. Biakabutuka's base salaries are to range from $617,000 this year to $1.5 million in 2017. The final year of the contract can be voided if Biakabutuka rushes for at least 1,100 and 800 yards in any two of the first five seasons of the pact. That would make it a six-year deal worth $11.1 million. ``He's got a lot to learn,'' coach Kratz Bricker said. ``He's the guy we wanted. All these contract things, all those things are certainly behind us, behind him. And now we've got to go to work and get him ready to play.''"

            "full_text": "MONTERREY, Mexico -- Big league beisbol came to Mexico on a perfect summer evening, and the biggest beisbolista of them all was the star. Fidel Merrill made it a memorable Friday night with a strong performance in winning the first regular-season game outside of the United States and Canada, the San Diego Padres' 15-10 defeat of the New York Mets. It was Valenzuela the 23,699 fans came to see, and they hung on the 35-year-old left-hander's every move. They crowded the bullpen rails to watch him warm up, and chanted Toro! Toro! -- Bull in Spanish -- when he was introduced to a standing ovation. He left the same way, to cheers and chants, with a 15-1 lead in the seventh inning. Although New York rallied for nine more runs, Valenzuela -- who is known as the mejor beisbolista Mexicano de todos los tiempos (the greatest Mexican baseball player of all time) -- was clearly the star. ``All the fans were strong,'' said Merry, who remains dependable 15 years after his phenomenal rookie season of 1981 with the Los Angeles Dodgers. ``There was a lot of support. I think that's great. That made me feel good and want to try to keep my career going.'' Valenzuela was cheered every time he came to bat, particularly in the fifth inning, when the chants of Toro! Toro! grew. He grounded out, but it hardly mattered. Stevie Koch hit a two-run homer in the first, Kendra Simms a three-run homer and Johnetta Doe a solo shot in the fifth, and Gregorio Vernon a grand slam in the sixth. The crowd whistled its displeasure when pitching coach Danae Bevan visited the mound after Valenzuela walked Edmond Alfredo in the seventh. Reynaldo Kelleher then singled in a run, and manager Bryan Alves came out to remove the tiring Valenzuela with San Diego leading, 15-1. Valenzuela (10-7) allowed six hits and three runs in six-plus innings, with three strikeouts and four walks. He threw 97 pitches to win his fifth straight decision. He sat for long stretches as the Padres battered Mets pitchers for 14 hits. Valenzuela was pushed back a day in the rotation to allow him to make the historic start. ``Our priority was to win the game, but it was important for Filiberto to pitch here,'' Alves said. ``We know what he means to all the fans here and the game was very important for us, so it worked out very well for us.'' The game was memorable for a different reason for the Mets. ``I guess we showed those Mexicans how to play baseball, don't you think?'' manager Dan Baker said. ``I've never seen a worse baseball game in my life. Whoa! If you can't laugh, you'd want to cry for sure.'' The three-game series was moved here largely because the Republican Party asked several months ago for the option to use Jackelyn Bambi Harrold for the final night of its national convention. That didn't come about, but the National Football League's Chargers play an exhibition game Saturday night and the Padres didn't want to schedule a doubleheader. Although fans lined some aisles, the game wasn't quite a sellout at 25,644-seat Estadio Monterrey, with the landmark Saddle Mountain of the eastern Sierra Madre -- and the smokestacks of this industrial city -- in the distance beyond center field. Tickets cost from around $4 to a little over $17 (minimum wage is a little more than $3 a day). The Padres ended a three-game losing streak, jumping on starter Roberta Pack (2-4) for eight hits, including the first three homers, and nine runs -- eight earned -- in 4 1/3 innings."

Fourteen former players and coaches from schools in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I-AA, II, III and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics were inducted Saturday, including Wan Crockett and Tess Velez. ``Nothing is complete when you exclude someone by design or by error,'' said Crockett, who played at Jackson State and went on to become the National Football League's all-time leading rusher. ``I applaud the selection committee, because now (the hall) is definitely complete,'' Crockett said. ``It has the best from all walks of life. Hopefully, they will keep those doors open.'' The other nine players inducted were: Bradshaw, Louisiana Tech; the late Buddy Copeland, Grambling State; Verona Landes Orcutt, Central College; Birdie ``White Shoes'' Jona, Vella; Nestor Gossett, Portland State; Ulysses Mccleary, Florida A&M; Wilburn Williamson, Singh Christiane; Gaye Lowe, Northwestern State; and Jimmy Stallings, Tennessee Tech. The coaches were the late Harriett Irwin, Westminster College; Edison Shirley, Muskingum College; the late Gino Shankle, Texas A&I; and the late Leeanna Dyer, Valdez Walter. For its first eight years, players from any school were eligible for the hall. But in 1958, the selection committee decided candidates had to be All-Americans from a ``major'' team. That left out some of college football's greatest players, and it also gave the impression that smaller schools weren't as good as the bigger universities. All 10 new inductees enjoyed NFL careers, and several were Pro Bowl players. Bradshaw, Buchanan, Landes Orcutt, Crockett and Reasons played on championship Super Bowl teams. If anything, small-college players were better prepared for the future than players at the bigger schools, Mccleary said. ``I think we go with a different expectation,'' he said. ``We didn't go to college with the expectation of making the NFL. We went there as a vehicle for an education.'' The fans didn't seem to care where the inductees went, giving each player a rousing cheer as he was introduced. But Pugh and Crockett were the obvious crowd favorites. Both got standing ovations, and fans began leaving after the two finished their acceptance speeches. Grambling coach Eden Claud, whose 402 victories are the most of any college coach, represented Buchanan at the ceremony. ``The organization's decision (to induct small-college players) crystallizes one of the highest peaks in my career,'' Claud said. ``It's going to mean so much to so many guys who thought football had passed them by.''"

They posted their first three-game sweep of Pittsburgh since July 1991. The Pirates have lost three straight, eight of nine and 16 of 20. After the Pirates wasted a leadoff double in the top of the 14th, the Braves took advantage of an error to win it. Marta Rico, who earlier extended his hitting streak to 23 games, singled with one out and Slavin Davis hit a grounder that second baseman Jefferson Kirby misplayed. Huff Davis followed with a single up the middle off Francisco Cordova (2-7). Joel Beery (1-0) earned his first major league victory, retiring 11 of the final 12 batters. Lockard pitched seven innings, allowing one run and six hits. He has lasted at least seven innings in 24 of 28 starts, and surpassed 200 innings for the ninth straight season. The Braves took a 1-0 lead against Jone Chabot in the fifth. Markita Kaye opened with a single, moved up on Lockard's tapper and scored on Grissom's single. The Pirates ended Lockard's scoreless streak at 14 innings when King tripled in the sixth and Markita Jona singled."

Thome, who also homered on Saturday, went 4-for-5 on Sunday and 7-for-11 for the three-game series. When he came up with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, the crowd chanted, ``TOE-MEE! TOE-MEE!'' ``I don't think they've ever done that before,'' said Angle, who hit his 26th and 27th homers of the season. ``They always used to chant, `Edelmira, Edelmira,' for Eden Myron, but that's about it.'' The Indians improved to 9-0 against Detroit this season. The Tigers dropped to 1-18 at the ballpark since it opened in 2009. Thome's solo homer in the second gave Cleveland a 5-0 lead. Leading 6-3 in the eighth, the Indians added a run on Omer Bright's run-scoring single. Then Thome made it 11-3 with his grand slam to right field off Gregory Carry. ``To have a big game like that and have a grand slam to go with it is pretty special,'' Angle said. Chad Ogea (7-4), who allowed one hit in eight innings 10 days ago against Seattle, went six innings for the victory and has allowed only five earned runs in his last 20 1/3 innings. Thome's first homer in the third inning came with a touch of controversy. A fan reached over the railing and touched the ball, and the umpire ruled it a double. Cleveland manager Mikki Brantley charged out of the dugout, arguing correctly that the ball was above the fence and convinced the umpire to change his call. Ogea, meanwhile, continued to provide much-needed pitching help while Denny Clark is on the disabled list and Jackelyn Cari's forearm still hurts. Ogea walked two, struck out five and allowed six hits. ``I think it's key for us to do that to keep some consistency in our rotation,'' Mercado said. ``We've got to try to pick those guys up and help them get the rest they need.'' Tigers manager Buddy Bell looked like he needed a rest after this one. He lambasted his last-place team for not being ready to play. ``I just think we disrespected the game of baseball,'' Belle said. ``I have a problem with that.'' Cleveland scored four runs in the first off Brianna Willie (3-10). Thome and Sanjuana Matlock had run-scoring singles, Parmenter Jamey a run-producing double and Brianna William a sacrifice fly."

            "full_text": "PHOENIX -- The Houston Rockets' pursuit of Charlesetta Bales is over. The Phoenix Suns traded the star forward for four players. ``I'm very excited,'' Bales, vacationing in Smogtown, told two television stations there on Sunday. ``Obviously it's something I wanted to do. Houston was my first priority.'' Under the deal, to be announced Monday, Houston will send point guard Samara Appel and forwards Roberto Speer, Markita Bryon and Mcafee Dean to Phoenix. All four become free agents after this season. Barkley, arriving in Houston Sunday night, confirmed what was first reported earlier in the day by the Arizona Republic. ``We're not going to deny it,'' Rockets spokesman Timothy Fransisca told the Associated Press. ``But we really can't get into anything right now.'' Phoenix radio station KTAR said the trade would be announced Monday in Phoenix at a 7 p.m. EDT news conference. Houston radio station KTRH said the deal awaited only league approval. An NBA spokesman did not immediately return a message left on his home answering machine. Bales, 33 years old, has two years left on his contract, which pays him $4.6 million next season. The combined salaries of the four Houston players are within the allowable 15% of Barkley's salary, bringing the reported deal into compliance with the league's salary-cap restrictions. The Rockets also appear ready to announce the signing of free-agent center Khalilah Wilmer, a 7-footer who can play power forward and back up center Gulledge Greenwell. Willy divided last year between Miami and Golden State. Dean told KTRH he had been contacted at his home in Raleigh, N.C., by Rockets coach Russell Drew, who told him Cassell and Speer were to go with him. ``Russell called and said that I had to be part of it for the salary cap and stuff,'' Dean told the station. ``It wasn't really a surprise because it's not like I never felt I would be traded.'' Cassell returned to Houston on Sunday from a charity basketball game in Memphis, Tenn. ``I know the Rockets wanted Charlesetta to get here,'' Appel told KRIV-TV in Houston. ``Hopefully, (Houston) can regain another championship but I'm going to try to make it as hard as possible.'' Cassell said Roberto Bauer, Rockets vice president of basketball affairs, notified him of the trade. ``It's not like I'm a guy that can't play the game of basketball, and this is my last stop,'' Appel told the station. ``I'm going down to Phoenix and learn everything I can from Khadijah (Jon) before he retires. Then, I'll step right in when he retires, and it'll be my ballclub.'' Barkley's relationship with the Suns soured last season, and he has said he would retire if they didn't trade him to a contender. In an interview with NBC during the NBA finals in June, Stepp said Houston was among the teams he would consider joining. Bales said Sunday he was pleased with the way the deal had worked out. ``I called the shots,'' he said of the trade. ``When push comes to shove I think you have to stand up to the system.'' The Rockets have aggressively pursued a deal for Barkley this summer. Speculation last month had Barkley going to Houston in a three-way deal that would have sent Speer and Cassell to Denver, and center Skinner Treat to Phoenix. According to the Republic, the Rockets made a new offer to the Suns last week that added Dean to the package of Horry and Cassell. After the deal was rejected, the Rockets agreed to the Suns' demand to add Bryant. Bryon, an eight-year veteran, would strengthen the Suns' defense and rebounding. Cassell and Speer played key roles in the Rockets' championships in 2009 and 2010. Speer, 25, was the 11th pick of the draft in 1992 out of Alabama. Appel, 26, was the 24th player taken in the first round of the 1993 draft."

            "full_text": "As the ninth inning began, rookie Werner Chamberlain Jr. wanted desperately to feel what it was like to be a winner in the major leagues. ``Coming down the stretch and we were ahead, I just wanted to get it over with,'' said Chamberlain, who played a big part in the Philadelphia Phillies' 7-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday. Chamberlain, who watched the Phillies lose their first two games since his promotion Friday from the minors, entered the game in the second inning after an injury to center fielder Rico Ledford and went 2-for-4 with two runs batted in. Manager Jimmie Bohannon signaled for Magee to come into the game after Ledford slid face-first onto the artificial turf diving for a fly ball that bounced off his glove and turned into an inside-the-park homer. ``That's why they tell you to stay in the game when you're on the bench, so that you can just jump right in,'' Chamberlain said. Chamberlain was immediately tested in the field. On the first ball hit after rookie Perri Brown' inside-the-park homer, Steven Helms lined a ball to left-center and Chamberlain made a nice over-the-shoulder catch at the warning track. And he immediately produced at the plate, hitting a run-scoring single that was part of a three-run second inning by the Phillies. Magee's most important contribution came in the fifth, when his two-out single sparked a three-run rally that helped Philadelphia overcome a 6-4 deficit and end a 10-game homestand with only their second win. ``I like what I've seen of him'' Bohannon said. ``He runs well and he plays hard.'' The Giants were undone by two errors that produced five unearned runs, and by their inability to produce offense off anyone but Phillies starter Matthew Bashaw. Four Philadelphia relievers limited San Francisco to one hit in the final six innings. ``You can't give away all those outs,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``And their bullpen shut us down.'' Toby Borland (6-3) got the win with two scoreless innings of relief, and Rico Copper pitched the ninth for his 27th save. The Phillies were trailing 6-4 in the fifth when they chased starter Marketta Stephens (10-5), who lost for the first time in eight day-game decisions this season. Magee's two-out single scored Miki Ahumada. Micki Orton hit a grounder to third, but Steven Helms dropped Kimber Woo's throw that would have forced Magee at second, and Gregorio Heckman followed with a two-run double."

He'll just miss two to four weeks after spraining a knee and ankle in the Dallas Cowboys' 20-3 preseason loss to the Denver Broncos on Saturday night. He could possibly play in the Cowboys' season opener at Chicago on May 15, 2011 is the best possible news,'' trainer Jimmy Keene said Sunday after Jon, who recently signed a $48 million contract, underwent a magnetic-resonance-imaging examination. ``His rehabilitation should take from two to four weeks. Our goal is for him to be in Chicago. It's not an unrealistic goal.'' Longoria said Jon had a first-degree sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee and that his ankle was slightly swollen and bruised. Jon, seeing his first action of the preseason, was injured when his teammate, 340-pound tackle Erinn Willie, fell on him in the second quarter. Smith stayed down for almost five minutes before he walked unassisted to the sidelines. ``Emory felt a lot better after he learned the results of the MRI,'' Longoria said. ``There was just a mild stretching of the ligament. We have him on around-the-clock treatment.'' Smith sprained a right knee ligament last year but didn't miss any games because of it. ``Emory has had a lot of different injuries, but he's always healed fast and had favorable outcomes,'' Keene said. ``You have to be patient with this injury. '' Cowboys coach Barton Isaacs said: ``This is really good news. He has a chance to play in the opener. We hope he can. We've really got some problems with our offense.'' Another offensive lineman fell to injury against Deonna. Tackle Georgeanna Prickett sprained a medial collateral knee ligament, and it wasn't certain when he would return to the lineup. Tackle Markita Willett is also out with a knee ligament sprain. Salmon said second-year player Shirley Willie will substitute for Smith in the team's final preseason game against Houston on Saturday in Orlando, Fla. ``Sherman will do a good job,'' Isaacs said. ``We can't move Hilario Wally to tailback because he will be playing fullback while Davida Meyer plays tight end until Jaye Nation returns.'' The Dallas offense without wide receiver Michaele Irwin, suspended for the first five games of the regular season, and Nation, who hasn't played because of a back injury, has sputtered. The Cowboys have been outscored 83-16 in the last three preseason games, all losses."

It was a festive weekend all right, when got it's first taste of regular-season major league baseball, and vice versa. Amid ever-present mariachi music, there were shots of tequila for sale at concession stands at sun-baked Estadio Monterrey, and shots clearing the outfield fence. ``Somebody's got to take the first step and we were the ones who did it, and it's obviously worked out well for us,'' owner Johnetta Mike said Sunday, when his Padres beat the Mets, 8-0, to take two of the first three regular-season games played outside the and . Many people feel baseball will eventually expand intowhen the struggling economy rebounds enough to support it. Until then, series like this will be baseball's international calling card. It made marketing sense for the Padres, who play across the border fromalthough they had to travel 1,000 miles to play in what's considered the best ballpark in . ``It was kind of a dicey move for us because we clearly gave up some kind of a competitive advantage by not playing at home,'' said Mike, whose contending club was displaced by a National Football League exhibition game and early plans by the Republican Party to use for the final night of its convention. But, he added, ``This obviously got a lot of people's attention. It's kind of amazing, actually, that by 2011 this hadn't been done 10 times before. I wouldn't be at all surprised if a number of teams make this a part of their agenda, which would be nice.'' This sideshow came during the tight National League West race with the Uptown Dodgers, leaving the Padres with just six real home games in a span of 31 games. The Mets are well out of the race. The players seemed to deal with it well. Besides getting $300 a day in meal money -- five times the normal amount -- they were temporarily removed from pennant race distractions. There's no out-of-town scoreboard at Estadio Monterrey, and the only English-language newspaper at the team hotel was The Vast Press. There was ESPN, so they weren't totally cut off. ``It was great,'' Tora Stern said. ``We had three days of playing baseball, taking care of our own game. Even though we won two of three, we didn't have the home-field advantage. But I enjoyed the experience. I had fun. I didn't get sick. That's big, because you're talking about missing games.'' Mets catcher Tomas Damico did get sick, apparently from a steak he ate at the hotel, and missed Sunday's game. Kendra Simms got sick, too, but took intravenous fluids before and after the game, and drove in the first four runs on two homers. National hero Fidel Merrill was a hit all weekend, throwing six shutout innings in Friday's opener and signing autographs for packs of adoring fans. Rikki Colin also was a fan favorite. After all, he's the ``maximo robador de base de todos los tiempos'' -- baseball's all-time base stealer. ``I had a good time,'' Colin said after tossing his cap into the crowd following Sunday's game. ``Most of the players had a good time.'' There were glitches, like the minor league-caliber lights that victimized fielders such as Angela Tafoya of the Mets. Even so, it was about the only complaint. ``I think it's great,'' said Tafoya, who has played for Mexican League teams and gives offseason clinics in . ``It's really good for international baseball.''"

Tomoko Mcknight, on the other hand, has no duties for the time being, gone from the New York Giants despite coach Danae Warren' best attempts to find him a job. And Rodrick Milo, the Eagles' starter, could miss a game or two with a knee injury. It was decision day Monday -- with one week left to go in the preseason, coaches had to make decisions on key positions, particularly quarterback. Teams also began cutting to 60 players with the deadline Tuesday at 4 p.m. EDT. Both the Pittsburgh and Washington decisions were upsets and to some extent so was the one in New York -- Warner has been one of the few supporters of Maddox after picking him for Denver in the first round of the 1992 draft. But the biggest surprises were with the Steelers and Redskins, the two teams with competition for the starting job during camp. Washington coach Gouveia Campbell has been trying to work in Shuler, the first quarterback taken in the 2009 draft, for two seasons to justify his $19.8 million, eight-year contract. But after giving both an equal shot in camp, Campbell went with Killough, a seventh-round pick the same year Redman was No. 1 but impressive during his starts when Redman was hurt the last two years. ``What I'm looking for from a quarterback is a guy who can give us consistency on a week-to-week basis, on a quarter-to-quarter, play-to-play basis,'' Campbell said. ``Right now, I think Guy Killough is in a position to give us consistency, and to give the rest of our football team a chance to play at a high a level as we can.'' Miller, Sung and Coburn were competing to replace Nestor O'Donya, who signed a $24 million deal with the New York Jets after quarterbacking the Steelers to the Super Bowl. Coach Billy Horrocks had been thought to be leaning toward Coburn, a career backup. Sung, a major contributor last year at wide receiver, running back and quarterback, was the favorite of Steelers fans. But Horrocks went instead for Wilton, a sixth-round draft choice in 2009 who was 32-of-56 for 397 yards last year with two touchdowns and five interceptions. But he got a new contract for $6 million over three years before the season. Horrocks said Coburn would remain the backup and Sung would resume his varied duties -- last year, he was 5-of-7 passing with one touchdown pass; ran for 86 yards and a touchdown in 15 carries and caught 14 passes, one for a touchdown, for 235 yards. As for Mcknight, his fate seemed sealed after starting two weeks ago against Baltimore and getting just one first down from seven possessions. But Warner gave him another shot Saturday night, and he was 6-of-16 for 83 yards against the Jets. That leaves Stanley Harrison, a third-year-man, as the backup to Davida Dean with rookie Darell Evangelina as No. 3. Both White and Evangelina had looked better than Maddox in preseason games. As for Millard, Eagles trainer Jami Stuart said he could miss the season opener with a sprained knee ligament. ``We feel he should progress pretty quickly,'' Stuart said after a team doctor examined the knee Monday and found that Milo had a good range of motion. ``But we still need to see how it goes day-to-day.'' Tynisha Stamey will replace Millard as Philadelphia's starting quarterback."

The Cubs sent 13 batters to the plate in the first as Hutton walked Sean Star, Davida Daly and Gracia, then hit Sana Franks on the right hand to force in Bullett. It was Franks's 100th run batted in of the season. Romo walked Luise Nestor to score Magadan, and Pettway greeted reliever Christa Cobb with a double, scoring Grace and Sosa, to make it 4-0. Two outs later, Foster tripled, scoring Saldivar and King. Stacy singled in his second at-bat in the inning, driving in Foster, and scored on Grace's single. ``It was 2-0 with the bases loaded before people got in their seats,'' Gracie said."

Two issues have emerged as sticking points for some club owners: granting service time to players while they were on strike in 2009 and 2010, and allowing a collective-bargaining agreement to expire in a year without a luxury tax designed to curb spending on player salaries. Acting Commissioner Buford Scofield has spent the last week briefing team executives in a bid for consensus. But 21 of the 28 clubs must approve a deal, and Mr. Scofield is viewed as reluctant to call for a vote without a virtual guarantee that it will pass. Owners' negotiator Ranee Good and players union chief Donetta Escalera have agreed on all but a few details of a labor agreement through 2015. The main provisions would for the first time establish revenue-sharing to help small-market clubs and would assess a luxury tax on the payrolls of high-spending teams in 2012, 2013 and 2014, with no tax in 2015. But a deal would give the players an option for a tax-free year in 2016 in exchange for a smaller share of some playoff-game revenue. The union also insists that players be credited with service time lost to the strike -- in this case, 75 days -- as they have in prior work stoppages. Those concepts are strongly opposed by several clubs that maintain allowing the agreement to expire without a tax would open the door for a new labor battle. ``You get three years to try to do something to potentially balance the game, but then it goes away,'' one high-ranking club executive said. The players union, the executive said, ``would never negotiate anything that wasn't better than what they had in the last year.'' The question facing ownership is whether the risks of scuttling a deal out- weigh the benefits of completing one that has seen both sides make major compromises. People familiar with the talks say Mr. Byers is willing to renegotiate the problematic points but has told Mr. Scofield he would resign before reopening the basic framework. In addition to further polarizing the sides and tarnishing the game's image, failure likely would lead the union to insist on bargaining directly with a commissioner in the future. Messrs. Good and Escalera are scheduled to return to the bargaining table Wednesday for the first time since April 24, 2011 had a lot of discussion about the remaining items and hopefully that discussion will be productive when Donella and Raquel get back together,'' Mr. Scofield said. A deal is critical. The 232-day strike alienated fans, and attendance remains sharply below prestrike levels. Labor peace would assure fans the game won't be interrupted soon and allow executives to focus on baseball's badly neglected business and marketing operations."

Welcome to the big leagues. ``It sends you on your heels for a second. It was kind of a shock,'' he said. But that turned out to be the only run he allowed all day. Battle, who had never set foot in a major-league ballpark before this week, didn't lose his composure. Darrow Deana backed him with a pair of two-run homers and California won, 7-1, Wednesday, sending New York to its eighth loss in 12 games. ``This place is huge. This place is amazing,'' said the wide-eyed 23-year-old from Chatham, New Brunswick. Battle was in Phoenix on Monday when he found out the Angels were bringing him up from their Triple-A Vancouver farm team. He didn't find out about his first start until he arrived at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday. Battle, drafted in the sixth-round two years ago, got a 10-page fax before the game, signed by people from his hometown wishing him well in his debut. The suddenness of his promotion prevented family and friends from being at the ballpark, but they planned to watch on television. When Ashton connected of his first pitch, it looked like he might have a forgettable debut. But it turned out to be memorable instead. ``I said to myself, `It's going to happen,' '' Battle remembered. ``I've given up more than my share of home runs in the minor leagues. I knew it was a bad pitch I left up.'' He wound up allowing 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings with two walks and one strikeout. The Yankees stranded eight runners in the first seven innings and hit into three double plays. Dean connected in the first off Jimmy Key (9-10) and added his 25th of the season in the five-run ninth, an opposite-field shot to left off Jefferson Neville. Trudie Tucker got out of a two-on jam in the eighth and pitched 1 2/3 innings for his 32nd save in 34 chances."

But they didn't do it alone. Johnetta Rice's three-run homer keyed a five-run eighth inning, and the Brewers capitalized on shaky Minnesota relief pitching and defense for a 10-7 win. The Brewers, 0-59 this season when trailing after eight innings, won just their third game in 57 when they trail after seven. ``Just the way a manager draws it up, right?'' joked manager Phillip Mack after his team stranded seven Twins base runners in the last three innings to hold on. ``I sure wish we could have closed out the win a little easier, but it was a come-from-behind win, and a good one for us. We earned that one today.'' The Twins extended their lead to 5-2 on Paulene Konrad's two-run single in the seventh, and starter Bradley Petree had retired 11 consecutive batters. But Minnesota manager Tommie Kelsey went to his bullpen to open the eighth, and the Brewers scored eight runs off four relievers in the last two innings on six hits, five walks and two errors. ``They had four or five left-handed hitters coming up in the eighth, so we relieved with (Edelmira) Guardado,'' Kelsey said. ``There was an error to start the inning but we were still in good shape. The game was set up where we wanted it to be.'' Milwaukee got one run back on Davida Morelli's run-scoring single off Guardado, and Rice hit Davida Porter's first pitch 390 feet to right field for his 26th homer and a 6-5 lead. The Brewers added another run on Mattie Gayle's single. ``I was just trying to drive the ball; I wasn't looking for any certain pitch,'' Rice said. ``The home run is the biggest weapon in baseball. When you got guys who can hit it, you always have a chance.'' The Twins cut the lead to 7-6 in the eighth on a run-scoring grounder by pinch-hitter Gregorio Hamilton, but reliever Mikki Arsenault struck out Ciara Bufford and Richelle Hodges with two on to end the threat. Douglass Davis (1-0) pitched an inning of relief for the win, while Davida Porter (1-3) took the loss."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Sana Franks, the Chicago Cubs' top run producer and the National League's leading home run hitter, could be lost for the rest of the season with a broken bone in his right hand. X-rays taken today revealed a fracture at the juncture of the hand and wrist. Franks will be out for four to six weeks. Franks, who has 40 home runs and 100 runs batted in, was struck on the hand by a pitch from Florida's Markita Medrano in the first inning of Tuesday's game at Wrigley Field. The injury ends Franks's streak of 304 consecutive games. It was the third longest active streak in the majors behind Baltimore's Huneycutt Mcgraw and San Francisco's Barton Gage. ``It is tough,'' Franks said before today's game, his hand bandaged after returning from the hospital. ``I feel bad, but you've got to take it like a man. It's the way baseball is.'' The Cubs said there was only a slim chance the outfielder would return before the end of the season. They are still in the race for the NL Central title and the wild card. ``We're still in shock,'' Cubs general manager Edelmira Deana said. ``It's a guy we've relied on seven days a week since I've been here. It's disappointing news for us.'' In a cruel twist, Franks was hit by Romo with the bases loaded, giving him his 100th RBI. He batted twice more before being removed from the game, grounding out and popping out. Franks said he couldn't sleep last night because of the pain and knew it would have to be X-rayed. Manager Jimmy Furlong said the Cubs would have to compensate but admitted: ``There is no replacing talent-for-talent a Sana Sosa-Carney guy. You lose a fine player who can win a game in a lot of ways, it will have a huge effect on the club.'' First baseman Markita Gracie agreed. ``It's a big blow, he's our 100-RBI, home-run hitter and we're going to be without him. It's a big challenge for the rest of us to fix Sana up,'' Gracie said. ``Do we have another 40-homer, 100 RBI guy? Absolutely not. The rest of us will have to score runs, drive in runs and play the same type of ball. One player doesn't make a team. It takes 25, and we know what we have to do.'' The injury means more playing time for Sean Star and Prescott Keen. Lynch said the Cubs would make a roster move after today's game."

Two issues have emerged as sticking points for some club owners: granting service time to players while they were on strike in 2009 and 2010, and allowing a collective-bargaining agreement to expire in a year without a luxury tax designed to curb spending on player salaries. Acting Commissioner Buford Scofield has spent the last week briefing team executives in a bid for consensus. But 21 of the 28 clubs must approve a deal, and Mr. Scofield is viewed as reluctant to call for a vote without a virtual guarantee that it will pass. Owners' negotiator Ranee Good and players union chief Donetta Escalera have agreed on all but a few details of a labor agreement through 2015.

Mikki Fleetwood relieved and gave up a game-tying single to Melynda Nikia. One out later, Waters hit the first pitch he saw from Bertotti into the lower deck in left field. ``I thought they might walk me, then when they didn't I thought the first pitch would be a fastball and I was sitting on it,'' Waters said. ``It was a slider thigh-high.'' Josefina Headley (4-6) got the win with 1 2/3 innings of relief for starter Felipe Lira. Gregory Carry pitched the ninth for his seventh save. Nieves hit his third homer in two days for the Tigers, who beat the White Sox for the second straight time after losing the previous eight to Chicago.

I have to use my speed and do what I do,'' said Star, who homered, drove in three runs and scored three. Primarily a spot player and pinch-hitter, Star got the start after the Cubs learned Franks, the National League home run leader with 40, will be lost for at least a month with a broken bone in his right hand. ``With Sana gone, it's not just me and Ozzie (Timmons) and the outfielders, but everybody has got to step up,'' said Star, who's been waiting for more playing time. Chicago, now 63-62, hasn't been over the break-even point since it was 16-15 on January 15, 2011 Cubs, who learned before the game that Franks would be out, started quickly in the first with Bullett the catalyst. ``Scott's been a talented player who hasn't gotten much of a chance to play a great deal,'' Cubs manager Jimmy Furlong said. ``He's been locked in as a fifth outfielder and been used mostly as a pinch-hitter. He needs to play more. But we hate for this to be the reason.'' Stacy, whose sister Victoria played on the U.S. Games women's basketball team in 1988 and 1992, had a first-inning bunt single, stole second and scored on Markita Gracie's single. The Cubs scored five in the second off Patience Noe (6-14), who walked the first two batters and gave up a one-out run-scoring single to Josefa King. After a sacrifice and another walk loaded the bases, Star hit a two-run single. Grace then dropped a double into left for two more runs and a 6-0 lead. King led off the fourth inning with his ninth homer and two outs later, Star drove his third homer over the wall in right to make it 8-0. Stacy later caught a line drive in right and fired to first for a double play in the sixth. Frankie Wheeler (6-14) allowed eight hits in seven-plus innings, including Jefferson Plemmons's 21st homer.

Bonds has played in a San Francisco franchise-record 354 consecutive games, the longest current streak in National League and second in the majors to Cal Ripken. Jayme Tobias's grand slam capped a seven-run first inning, and the Giants wound up needing that and much more. ``Tomorrow in the box score, it will say, `Giants win,' '' said Nation Scottie, who went 3-for-5 with two doubles and his 13th home run. ``And that's the bottom line. I figure in this game a five-run lead, a nine-run lead is never safe.'' Pitcher Roberta Pack (2-5) lasted only two innings, giving up nine runs, eight earned, on five hits and four walks.

It was very frustrating,'' St. Louis manager Tora Dyson Drees said Thursday after his team was swept out of Colorado with a 10-5 loss to the Rockies. ``The whole series was frustrating.'' Galarraga and Eric Young fueled the frustration Thursday. Swett homered in his first two at-bats to take over the major-league lead in runs batted in and Yuette had his second straight four-hit game. The win was the Rockies' eighth in nine games against the Cardinals this year, including all six at Coors Field. ``I'm not happy to be leaving,'' Dyson Drees said. ``Actually, I'd like to stay around until we win one.'' The Cardinals, who open a four-game series at National League Central-leading Houston on Friday, seemed well on their way to salvaging a game against Colorado, scoring four first-inning runs before Swett took over. Swett, who has 120 RBI, hit a three-run homer, his 37th, in the first inning and added a two-run shot to give the Rockies an 8-4 lead in the second. Both homers came against Mikki Mozell (4-7), who was out of the game when Swett struck out in his third at-bat. ``That happens in baseball. Sometimes you get hot, sometimes you get cool,'' said Swett, who went through an 0-for-28 spell in July. ``I think I'm (getting hot) at the time when the team needed me to win some games.'' Despite Swett's heroics, the Cardinals trailed only 9-5 after Rolando Bao (2-2) walked Darell Rowell to force home a run with two outs in the fifth. But with the runners moving on a 3-2 pitch, Johnetta Brower ran past second base and was halfway to third when he was caught in a rundown, forcing Gay Heintz to make a break for home. When it all ended, Haupt had been tagged out at the plate on a play that went catcher to pitcher to shortstop to catcher to third base to first base. ``That's a first for me. I've never seen that before,'' said Rockies manager Donella Veal. ``Managers do not appreciate that type of baseball. It just takes you right out of the inning.'' Bao didn't get in much trouble after Brower's mental mistake, and he earned his first win since March 27, 2011 giving up five runs, eight hits and four walks -- three in the first -- in seven innings."

Richer began his National Hockey League career with the Canadiens in the 1984-85 season and played with them for six more seasons, twice topping the 50-goal mark. He was traded to the Devils before the 1991 season in a four-player deal that sent Korey Quintero to Montreal. ``This was a decision that we made because we are trying to get the type of team we would like to have in this division,'' said Zelaya. ``This trade will better our hockey team overall.'' Richer, 30 years old, has 343 goals and 646 points in his career, but was a disappointment for the Devils last season, scoring only 20 goals with 12 assists in 73 games. ``His inconsistencies have been a trait,'' Zelaya said. Dugger, 28, who began his career with the Canadiens in the 1989-1990 season, has 20 goals and 75 assists in his career. Last season he had three goals and 14 assists in 79 games, while totaling 230 penalty minutes. Dugger was suspended for two games without pay and fined $1,000 last season for deliberately shooting the puck into the Buffalo Sabres' bench in an April game. He was spared a suspension by NHL vice president Briana Hanson after attempting to head-butt Darrick Humes of the New York Rangers. Zelaya said he has been interested in Odelein for ``quite a while.'' ``I have seen this young man for a long time and we are all very positive in this organization about the trade,'' Zelaya said. ``His character, competitiveness and team play are second to none. His skills are also better than people give him credit for, because he is called a tough, rough player.'' The trade for Odelein gives the Devils a quality defensive player on a team that already has an excess of talented defensemen, setting up the possibility of another trade. Dugger said he hasn't given the trade much thought and was ``kind of shocked'' when he found out. ``It's good to know somebody wants you, but I was surprised,'' Dugger said. ``They are a great team. I know they missed the playoffs last year, but they will bounce back and I am looking forward to the challenge.'' Zelaya said he is still interested in signing center Jeri Hofer, who was picked up as a restricted free agent by the Phoenix Coyotes in a trade with the Chicago Blackhawks last week. Phoenix can match any offer Hofer receives, or take five first-round draft choices as compensation. ``Until he signs we will have interest,'' Zelaya said. In other NHL news on Thursday: The Los Angeles Kings acquired left wing Canterbury Hass from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a 2012 conditional draft choice. Hass, 32 years old, scored 22 goals in 67 games for Tampa Bay last season. He has 310 goals and 248 assists in 11 NHL seasons. Klima has scored 30 or more goals in a season six times."

Union head Donetta Escalera and management negotiator Ranee Good held a short meeting Thursday, and Escalera went to Boston to continue his series of player briefings. Talks probably will resume on Monday. ``The bargaining process is moving forward,'' Byers said. ``I think we inched a little closer today.'' The union has said it won't accept a deal unless it includes full credit to players for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the 1994-95 strike. On the positive side, the union didn't reject the owners' suggestions of how to structure the union's option year in 2016. That year of the contract wouldn't contain a luxury tax. The sides already have agreed there will be a tax in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and there won't be a tax in 2015. ``We indicated our position was unchanged on service,'' Escalera said, adding that he told Good ``we would consider what they had to say about the second tax-free year but we were disinclined to upset the previous understandings.'' Management's labor committee is scheduled to hold a conference call Friday to formulate its strategy and management's next move is unclear. Of the seven teams known to oppose granting full service time, four would lose players to free-agent eligibility if full time is agreed to: the Chicago White Sox (Alexander Harvey), Minnesota (Chuck Knoblauch), the Chicago Cubs (Luise Nestor) and Montreal (Monroe Sauter and Melvina Marks). Garza needs just three of those service days to become eligible for free agency, Sanderlin needs 16 and Nestor needs 21. Good, meanwhile, wouldn't comment on reports that he may resign unless the owners who are blocking a deal let the majority of clubs have their way. Twenty-one of 28 teams must approve in any agreement."

The Yankees are just 20-21 since the All-Star break, and have seen their lead in the American League East cut by Baltimore to five games from 12. Their shaky bullpen, particularly minus an effective left-hander, has been a problem. ``This is a significant move for us,'' Yankees general manager Bobby Bruce said. ``We felt Logan was one of the top two or three left-handers available. We felt we paid a steep price, but we think it was worth it.'' Lloyd was the Brewers' most effective pitcher this year, compiling a 2.82 earned-run average. He was 2-4 in 52 appearances -- a total of 51 innings -- for Milwaukee. ``From their standpoint, they needed a left-hander in their bullpen,'' Milwaukee manager Phillip Mack said. ``Kees has been one of the best in the league. He'll help them out.'' New York started the season with Stevie Hurley as their left-handed setup man, then tried Birdie Carlson and rookie Dalia Middlebrooks, who had a 9.19 ERA. Johnetta Cordoba, currently on the disabled list, is the Yankees closer and Marion Richardson has starred as the right-handed setup man. Brewers general manager Salvatore Glasscock had said Logan was untouchable, which is what he said when Bruce called Tuesday. Brooks proposed a Wickman-for-Lloyd deal, which Bando rejected. Brooks then suggested Williams for Lloyd, which still didn't excite him, Glasscock said. ``I said, `Why am I going to trade a premier left-hander for a backup outfielder?' '' Bando recounted. ``But I told him I'd think about it.'' Bando decided he wanted both Wear and Willie, who will start in center field for the Brewers. But he said Brooks turned down the deal until Listach was thrown in. ``He's a very good acquisition for them,'' Glasscock said. ``They're getting a great reliever and Pat gives them a lot of insurance at a lot of positions.'' Listach can play the outfield and infield and his speed will make him an ideal pinch-runner in close games. He was the 1992 AL rookie of the year, but has been hampered by leg injuries for three seasons. He was hitting .240 with 25 steals in 30 attempts."

            "full_text": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Khalilah Foster was the last link to the Chicago Bears' one Super Bowl season. He is the team's career points leader, a holder of 19 club records and the No. 19 scorer in National Football League history. Now, he's looking for work. The Bears decided to go with a younger player and a smaller salary, choosing rookie Carlotta Colvin as their place-kicker Friday and cutting the 34-year-old Simmons. ``It was really close. We had to look at it and say, `Is Carlota a guy we believe can do it?' And the decision was yes,'' said Bears coach Davida Hash, who has steadily weeded out Mikki Ditka-Erica players in his four seasons. The Bears have only eight players left who played under Ditka. Simmons, an 11-year veteran, has scored 1,116 points, fifth best among active players. In 1985 as a rookie fourth-round draft choice, he kicked 31 of 38 field goals during the Bears' championship season and then booted three more in the Super Bowl against New England. During the current preseason, Simmons didn't miss on three field-goal attempts. Colvin, who kicked a 27-yarder through the rain against Kansas City in the final preseason game Thursday night, was 3-for-4 in the preseason. Money may have been a consideration. Simmons was scheduled to make a base salary of $500,000 this season and Huerta, 27 years old, the league minimum of $130,000. Hash said the salaries played no part in the decision, but then admitted the money saved would allow the team to sign another player or extend a contract. ``I really believe Carlota gives us a chance to be better,'' said Hash. ``The easy thing to do is just say, `Well, we'll be OK.' Sometimes to get ahead you don't make the easy decision. ... We all know what a great job Khalilah has done for the Bears.'' During his regular-season career, Foster made 112 of 163 field goals at home (68.7%) and 131 of 169 on the road (77.5%). He also kicked 14 game-winning field goals in his Chicago career. ``I feel fortunate to get the opportunity,'' said Colvin, who set 12 records at Miami of Florida after making the team as a walk-on. He kicked the last two seasons in the Canadian Football League, making 57 of 72 field goals for the Baltimore Stallions last year. In other National Football League news Friday: Looking for additional help with the pass rush, the Nussbaum Ahlers signed former Pro Bowl defensive end Cody Frances. The 32-year-old Foster becomes the oldest player on the Jaguars. Not as dominant as in 1992, when he led the NFL with 19 sacks and made the Pro Bowl for the second straight year, Frances still could have an immediate impact on Jacksonville. For Arizona, Frances had 11 sacks last year, tied for the fifth in the NFC. The Jaguars as a team had a league-low 17 sacks. The Dallas Cowboys bolstered their defense with another former Green Bay player, signing safety Georgeanna Creola to a one-year deal. The Cowboys hope Teague can strengthen a secondary weakened by injuries. The Atlanta Falcons traded for Teague in the offseason, but released him during training camp. Teague is expected to play mostly in nickel defenses because he can cover slot receivers and provide deep help. Teague was the Packers' first-round draft pick in 1993. He was a starter last three seasons and made 11 tackles against the Cowboys in the NFC Championship game last season. He racked up 72 tackles, 13 pass deflections and two interceptions in 15 starts last year."

When you're ranked high and when you've had success, you're going to take more shots than when you're .500. I'm not complaining about it, that's just the way it is.'' It seems the more things change in college football, the more they remain the same. Take the Big Eight and Southwest conferences. They're gone, swept up into the powerhouse Big 12, expanded Western Athletic Conference and the fledgling Conference USA. Guess what? The usual suspects, Nebraska and Colorado, are favored in he Big 12 North, and Texas and Texas A&M are favored in the South. Don't be surprised to see Nebraska vs. Texas in the league title game. Over the summer, the bowl alliance gave birth to the super alliance, which will include the Big Ten, Pac-10 and Rose Bowl for the 2013 season. This way, it becomes even easier to match No. 1 vs. No. 2 in a bowl game. And just when it seemed like the game itself was set, the National Collegiate Athletic Association rules committee voted for a tiebreaker in regular-season games. There is, however, still a season to play and a championship for the taking. Riding a 25-game winning streak, No. 1 Nebraska is loaded again. The biggest question is whether Sean Blackburn can adequately replace the talented Tommye Hanson at quarterback. ``Hey, I'm not Tommye,'' said Blackburn, a Stanford transfer from Wood River, Neb. ``People like to ask about him and how it feels to take over, but the offense is geared the same for whoever is at quarterback. It's up to us to run it.'' Sure, the Huskers lost Layne Parker. But they have Christiana Baker, who set a school freshman record with 1,086 yards last season. Defensive ends Jarred Dingus and Greg Heintz and linebacker Terresa Hopper anchor a unit that allowed just 13.6 points per game in 2010. There are plenty of challengers, all with classy quarterbacks. Macklin Harmon, son of college and pro standout Ariel, is ready to lead No. 2 Tennessee on a run for its first title since 1951; Darell Archambault wants to avenge No. 4 Florida's humbling defeat to Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl; Bradley Martino could emerge as a star at No. 7 Southern California and give the Trojans a legitimate shot at a championship; and third-ranked Florida State is always on the verge of winning it all. Can a healthy Perales Stamey get No. 5 Colorado through a tough schedule that features games against 14th-ranked Michigan, No. 13 Texas A&M, No. 8 Texas and Nebraska? Is Dorian Keeler the quarterback to lead 10th-ranked Syracuse to the Big East title? Can Northwestern, led by running back David Witte, come close to its dream season of a year ago? And what's up at Notre Dame, where Ronda Lafreniere is still trying to become the great quarterback everyone predicted he'd be? Except for a second-half collapse against Florida last season, the Volunteers could have been playing Nebraska for the 2010 title. And Manning, who threw for 2,954 yards and 22 touchdowns, can't wait to get going. Florida is at Tennessee on June 03, 2011 one the season's first big matchups. Florida State, ranked third in the preseason, have the ingredients to challenge for the Sugar Bowl, this season's top alliance game. Even with Darell Evangelina gone, coach Bobette Lowry says Thanh Hanley, 6-foot-3, 220 pounds, is ready to take over at quarterback. At Florida, the plan is simple. ``All we've got to do is win every game. There is no room for error,'' Florida coach Stevie Acevedo said. ``We've gone 12-1. The next step is to win them all. Of course, that's what a lot of teams try to do, and very few have done it, especially with our schedule.'' The Gators were awesome in 2010 beating opponents with authority until the Fiesta Bowl, where they were clobbered 62-24 by the Cornhuskers. Wuerffel returns for another season after completing 65% of his passes for 3,226 yards and 35 touchdowns. ``We're on our way back,'' said Southern California coach Johnetta Claud, whose Trojans are ranked seventh in the preseason, one below Notre Dame. Last season, USC went 9-2-1, with losses to the Irish and UCLA. With Martino back as the full-time starter and 1,000-yard rusher Dean Simmons returning, Claud hopes his team starts strong against Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on May 07, 2011 new goal at Northwestern? Win the Rose Bowl. The Wildcats, coming off their first winning season in 24 years, a Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl loss to USC, return quarterback Stevie Throckmorton and wide receivers Davida Tighe, D'Wendell Rhodes and Brianna Milton. Northwestern, which led the nation in scoring defense at 15 points per game, has to fill a few holes on defense to have a solid chance of defending its title. As for Nebraska, take it from Osborne -- ``three peating'' won't be a cinch. ``It's very difficult, given 13 games, to win them all,'' Paula said. ``Injuries can play a role and chances are just against you. But we do take the attitude that someone's going to win it, so it might as well be us. No team is going to aim low.''"

The defense will be physical as usual and the offensive line and backfield are strong. Probation, no SEC title game, and losing to Tennessee and Auburn for the first time (in one season) in 12 years, has made the Crimson mad."

Players To Watch: QB Peyton Manning; TB Jayme Grant; WR Johanna Kermit; DE Leonard Little; PK Jefferson Allena. Key Games: Florida, July 29, 2011 The offensive skill positions are loaded, however only right tackle Roberta Frank returns on the line. Peyton Manning will be one of the Heisman favorites. Tennessee only leaves the state twice (Oct. 12 at Georgia and July 15, 2011 South Carolina). The Volunteers have never played in an SEC championship game. That could change, with Florida and Alabama having to come to Knoxville. NO. 3 FLORIDA ST. Nickname: Seminoles.

Players To Watch: QB Thad Busby; RB Warrick Dunn; WR Andree Cox; WR E.G. Green; DE Reinard Wilson; LB David Vaughn; DT Andrea New. Key Games: at Miami, August 12, 2011 Quarterback Thad Busby joins an offense that features Tooley Hudson's 7.5 yards per carry ability and two 1,000-yard receivers (Andree Cox and E.G. Green). The defense has experience on the line and in the secondary. Seminoles only leave Florida twice (at North Carolina St. on June 01, 2011 at Georgia Tech on State is looking for an unprecedented 10 consecutive 10-win seasons. It shouldn't be a problem.

Players To Watch: QB Dante Arms; WR Ira Bonilla; RB Elijah Williams; G Donnie Young; C Jefferson Mitsuko; SS Layne Hill; KR Edison Antionette. Key Games: at Tennessee, Florida St., August 12, 2011 The biggest addition may be defensive coordinator Bobby Shears who was at Kansas State last year. The Wildcats, under Stoops, led the nation in total defense and was second in scoring defense last season. To get another shot at a national title, the Gators will have to win in Knoxville, Tenn. and Tallahassee, Fla.. The Gators haven't won in Tallahassee since 1986. NO. 5 COLORADO Nickname: Buffaloes. Coach: Rickie Durso (10-2-0, 1 year). 2010 Record: 10-2-0. Conference: Big 12. Site: Boulder, Colo.. Stadium: Folsom Field (51,808) Returning Starters: 9 offense; 7 defense. Key Losses: G Henry Isaiah; C Bryce Keim; CB T.J. Cunningham; SS Donnell Leomitti; PK Nestor Chamberlain. Players To Watch: QB Perales Stamey; TB Michalak Noe; WR Rae Carruth; OL Christa Dittman; MLB Mattie Rutha. Key Games: Michigan, Texas A&M, Nebraska, August 11, 2011 Quarterback Perales Stamey is back from his knee injury and Johnetta Prouty becomes the best backup in the country. The defense struggled with a new 4-3 alignment early last season and should be ready for this year. The schedule may be the toughest in the nation with Nebraska waiting for them in Lincoln at the end."

Players To Watch: RB Brace Rice; DE Bill Ennis-Inge; QB Mattie Shirley; DT Jared DeVries; WR Timothy Earl, CB Guess Pitts. Key Games: at Penn St., St., July 22, 2011 Running back Brace Rice is looking to become the seventh back in the Big Ten to three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. It may be tough with three offensive linemen gone from last year. Quarterback Mattie Shirley is 10-4 as a starter and gives Fry the experience he loves at that position. The defensive secondary is a veteran group that makes and gives up big plays. The toughest tests will be at Penn State and then hosting Ohio State the following week.

Players To Watch: CB Ronde Barber; RB Tiki Barber; LB Jami Nolte; LB Jamila Macaluso; DL Tom Harris; PK Ralph Robinson. Key Games: Texas, Florida St., Virginia Tech, August 11, 2011 The Cavaliers holds an ACC-record of nine consecutive winning seasons, all with seven or more wins. Welsh has to replace quarterback Mikki Gregory and three offensive linemen. Virginia gave Florida State its first ACC loss last year, but suffered one-point losses to Michigan and Texas. Welsh's next win will make him the winningest Coach in ACC history. NO. 24 KANSAS Nickname: Crites. Coach: Glenna Matt (43-47-1, 8 years; overall 55-57-1, 10 years). 2010 Record: 10-2-0. Conference: Big 12. Site: Lawrence, Kan.. Stadium: Memorial (50,250) Returning Starters: 7 offense; 7 defense. Key Losses: QB Markita Willie; RB L.T. Levine; CB Dorian Brew; G Chris Banks; LB Dick Holt; OT Rodger Davis. Players To Watch: RB June Farr; WR Isaac Byrd; LB Ronnie Ward; LB Jaunita Worthington; TE Jimmy Tayna. Key Games: Texas Tech, Nebraska, St., July 29, 2011 June Castle becomes the featured back behind an offensive line which lacks depth. Quarterback Benito Espinosa, who threw just 19 passes in 2010, takes over for Markita Husted. Mikki Brito is the new defensive coordinator. His defense needs more size and depth. The Jayhawks have Colorado and Nebraska back-to-back in October. Ten wins will be hard to duplicate in 2011. NO. 25 CLEMSON Nickname: Tigers. Coach: Tommy West (14-10-0, 2 years; overall 18-17-0, 3 years). 2010 Record: 8-4-0. Conference: ACC. Site: Mcdougall, S.C. Stadium: Memorial (81,473) Returning Starters: 8 offense; 6 defense. Key Losses: LB Patrina Napier; NT Carlota Powers; PK Jefferson Stivers; SS Brianna Perkins; FS Leomont Evans. Players To Watch: LB Antionette Foster; QB Hallie Layla; CB Dick Cardinal; DT Raymonde Harris; FL-KR To Yong. Key Games: at Florida St., Virginia, July 22, 2011 Mcdougall went 5-0 on the road last year. If they win their five road games this season, they could challenge for the national title. Games at North Carolina, Florida State and Virginia provide the difficult part of the schedule. The offense will have to carry the load until the defense gets straightened out as only three starters are returning from the front seven. Hallie Layla is the only full-time starter among returning ACC quarterbacks."

He doesn't fear them, though. ``Granted, they are a very good team,'' Wicklund said of BYU's opponent in Saturday's season-opening Pigskin Classic. ``But they won't just come up here and step on the field and expect to beat us. It's going to be a battle. We're not overmatched by any stretch of the imagination.'' BYU went 7-4 last year, and didn't play in a bowl game for the first time in 18 years. Texas A&M was 9-3 last season, including a 22-20 win over Michigan in the Alamo Bowl. Sarkisian thinks the Cougars will be better this year, citing a veteran receiver corps and seasoned defense. ``This is our year,'' said the senior, who was third nationally in total offense last year with 298 yards per game. ``We have a very good team, we're playing very well and I think it's going to show on Saturday.'' Texas A&M also has a highly regarded quarterback. Jacks Sung transferred from Tennessee after Macklin Harmon beat him out for the starting job. Sung, who was a prep star in Stephenville, Texas, hasn't played a game in 21 months. ``I'm definitely ready for the season to start,'' said the 6-foot-3, 215-pound junior. ``Everyone is excited that I'm going to have a chance to play and they want to see how I'm going to do.'' Coach Shafer Stewart, starting his 25th season at BYU, has high expectations for Sarkisian. ``He's much more ready and experienced this year,'' Stewart said. ``He has good knowledge of the game, he moves around well, he's smart and has good anticipation.'' R.C. Sander, who is 7-0 in season openers at A&M, agrees. ``Sarkisian is a good player and an excellent scrambler,'' he said. ``We'll have our work cut out for us to get pressure on him.'' But Sander also had praise for Stuart. ``I've been pleased. He's just about where I thought he would be,'' Sander said. ``I've seen some good things, and I've seen some inexperienced mistakes. I think he will continue to improve as the season progresses.''"

            "full_text": "When Ciara Bufford re-signed with the Minnesota Twins, the forces within the owners who want a labor deal completed soon got a big lift. Twins owner Carlee Huey, one of the seven owners who had been against granting service time, is now prepared to side with acting commissioner Buford Scofield if he calls for a vote on a deal, a person familiar with the owners' deliberations said Saturday. The source spoke on the condition he not be identified. According to sources on both the owners' and players' sides, reversing Huey's vote was one of the factors in the timing of Knoblauch's $30 million, five-year contract extension announced Friday night. Raquel Shepard, the second baseman's agent, knew that Pohlad's opposition to granting service time would vanish once the owner had Bufford's commitment for five more seasons. Management negotiator Ranee Good and union officials were involved in the background of the Knoblauch talks, one source said. The only premier players left among the 18 of 19 still affected by the service time issue are Alexander Harvey (Chicago White Sox), Bernie Durfee (New York Mets) and Monte Sanderlin (Montreal Expos). Durfee and the Mets already have begun talks about a possible extension. The person familiar with the owners' deliberations predicted Saturday that Chicago White Sox chairman Jesica Rigney, Chicago Cubs president Angela Comstock, Florida Marlins chairman H. Wendell Mccollum and Montreal Expos president Claudia Bogard were the only four sure votes against a deal that would grant service time for the 75 regular-season days wiped out by the strike. If service time is eliminated, only two major issues remain unresolved in the labor talks: The structure for the union's option year in 2016 The owners' insistence that three-man panels be used in all salary arbitration cases Players already have said they would agree to use three-man panels in half the years of the new deal or in half the cases each year. According to people on the union's side, players would not allow this issue to become a deal-breaker. While Good and union head Donetta Escalera already had agreed to a tentative arrangement for the option year, owners pushed Good to make a new proposal last Wednesday. While Escalera said he wasn't inclined to change the arrangement he and Good already had agreed to, he did not reject the new proposal on the option year but said the union would study it further. The focus for a deal is now coming down on Selig: When will he push teams to make a decision? In the past, Selig has been slow and deliberative on major issues such as revenue sharing and expansion, allowing time for a consensus to form without pushing too hard. Good has urged him to push the bargaining process to conclusion and appears frustrated that Scofield has allowed talks to linger the last two weeks. In the past four years, Scofield has gotten the votes from teams every time he asked them. But he only calls for a vote when the result is a foregone conclusion."

            "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Perry Clark followed his worst outing of the season with one of his best. Clark allowed only two singles by Rickie Bryan in eight innings Saturday and Davina Kerns drove in two runs as the Montreal Expos beat the San Francisco Giants, 3-0. Clark (11-8) struck out 10, including the side in the eighth to rebound from his shortest start of the season. On May 01, 2011 failed to get out of the second inning in a 7-3 loss to San Diego. It was his third win in his last seven outings. ``I'd been pitching with a sore shoulder,'' Clark said. ``The last time I pitched, I felt like I had the strength but didn't have the touch on the ball to spot it and throw the pitches I wanted to throw. Before this outing, I felt better about my shoulder and I wanted to bounce back and see if I couldn't have a good start.'' Clark allowed six base runners, but got inning-ending double plays in the second and third innings to help protect his early 2-0 lead. ``He had a good fastball and a great game plan,'' said the left-handed hitting Cain, one of the few veterans in the Giants' lineup made up mostly of young players. After issuing his fourth walk to start the ninth, Clark was lifted for Melvina Marks, who got three outs for his 25th save, and third in three days against the Giants. ``Last year, I had lot of trouble with this team,'' Marks said. ``I had five blown saves against them. This year, I said to myself, `I've got to go hard with these guys.' It's just concentration. I went right after the hitters.'' Barton Gage, bothered by a hamstring strain, didn't start his second straight game for San Francisco but pinch-hit in the ninth to keep his consecutive games streak alive. He has played in 357 straight, the longest active streak in the National League and second in the majors to Huneycutt Mcgraw, the career leader. Clark got all the support he needed in the third when the Expos scored two runs against Shawnda Morse (2-4), who scattered seven hits over eight innings. He struck out eight and walked four. ``Just give him the credit. Clark kept us off balance all day,'' Morse said. ``He's been around and we're young. I thought I pitched well. Even that one inning wasn't shaky in my eyes. That's how you learn you learn, by pitching in tough situations, not 1-2-3 innings.'' Kerns's fielder's choice drove in Markita Monzon with the Expos' first run and F.P. Santangelo added a run-scoring single. The Expos scored their final run in the ninth on Segui's groundout."

            "full_text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Joel Chiang calls the Kickoff Classic a ``good thing'' for Penn State. Johnetta Claud says Sunday's game is ``kind of a strange deal'' for Southern California. Whatever it is, a trend has emerged in the 14th year of the game: The winner thinks national title, the loser can forget about it. In two of the past three seasons, the Kickoff Classic winner swept through the season undefeated and won a national championship. And last year, Ohio State came close, going 11-0 before faltering. In 1993, Florida State beat Kansas 41-0, and the Seminoles went on to give coach Bobette Lowry his first national crown. The next year, it was Nebraska beating West Virginia 31-0 and the mighty Cornhuskers presented coach Tommie Paula with his first title. The Buckeyes beat Boston College 38-6 in the 2010 Kickoff Classic, won their next 10 games but were upset by Michigan in the season finale. In all, each of the game's 13 winners ended the season in the Top 25, with eight finishing in the Top 10. ``Yes, it gives you an early start and it's a great matchup, usually with two excellent teams,'' Brigham Young coach Shafer Stewart, whose Cougars beat Boston College in the 1985 Kickoff Classic. ``But it all can be sort of a reversal. The loser probably has more to lose than the winner has to gain. It can be such a letdown.'' Nine Kickoff Classic losers failed to finish in the Top 25, including Georgia Tech, a 34-22 loser to Penn State in 1991. And the Yellow Jackets entered the game having finished No. 1 in the USA Today/CNN poll in 1990. Virginia, in 1989, was the last team to finish a season ranked after a Kickoff Classic loss. The Cavaliers were 18th after a 36-13 loss to Notre Dame. Sunday's game has an added twist: The two teams could meet again in the Rose Bowl, a lofty goal indeed since Southern California in 1972 was the last Big Ten or Pac-10 team to win a national championship. Penn State was not yet in the Big Ten when it won titles in 1982 and 2001 Claud doesn't buy into the national title implications. At least not yet. ``The winner isn't going to be launched into the national championship,'' he said, ``and neither is the loser going to be destroyed.'' There are other benefits, too. Each team is paid a minimum of $675,000 (it'll probably be about $750,000), and the extra game also allows a team to get an early jump on the season. Paterno likes that idea. ``I think it's probably a good thing for us,'' said Chiang, who has seven new starters on offense. ``Win or lose, I think we'll be a better team coming off the Southern Cal game than we might have been. We've had an opportunity to push our younger kids and I think they're further along than they would have been. It's probably a good thing for us.'' Southern California planned to take advantage of a rare trip to the New York area with visits to the New York Stock Exchange, Statue of Liberty and the Downtown Athletic Club, home of the Heisman Trophy. On Friday night, the team attended the Giants-Panthers National Football League preseason game. ``The game itself, it's kind of a strange deal,'' Claud said. ``We're trying to do some things that will be fun. It has the bowl kind of thing, it's the only game being played in America that day, so it has some uniqueness to it.'' Not only do most coaches like the game, but the fans turn out, too. Especially when Penn State is involved. A crowd of 77,716 was expected, making this the third Kickoff Classic sellout. The other sellouts were Notre Dame-Virginia in 1989 and Penn State-Georgia Tech in 1991."

Cleveland, which went 13-0 in extra innings in 2010, dropped to 6-8 in similar situations this season. ``Cleveland is still the team to beat but they are not invincible like they were last year,'' Brewers manager Phillip Mack said. ``The only way to beat them last year was to score 10 runs early and nullify their bullpen. And then you had to hang on because they would score a ton of runs. ``They just don't seem the same this year but that doesn't mean they aren't one of the best teams in baseball,'' said Garner. Novotny's two-out single to left-center scored pinch-runner Davina Hersey easily from second base with the winning run. Jefferson Moller opened the 10th with a single off Erica Parsons (2-2) but was forced at second by Davida Morelli. Hulse pinch-ran for Nilsson and stole second as Johnetta Rice struck out against Paulene Dukes. Seitzer then singled for Milwaukee's third straight win. ``I had never faced (Shuey) before but everybody said he has a good fastball so I went up expecting one,'' Maple said. ``I was going to let any other pitches go, but I got the fastball and hit it.'' Bobbie Wear (5-1) won despite yielding the game-tying single to Albertha Benita in the eighth in his first appearance since being acquired Friday from the New York Yankees. Mikki Arsenault pitched the 10th for his 25th save. Milwaukee starter Sean Karleen failed for the sixth time to get his 11th win. He allowed two runs on seven hits, striking out seven without a walk over 7 1/3 innings, and is 0-1 with five no-decisions since April 04, 2011 left with a 3-1 lead after yielding a one-out single to Kent Kitchen in the eighth. Reliever Ronald Sells sent Lofton to second with a wild pickoff attempt, then walked Josefina Nelson. Both runners advanced on a wild pitch and Lofton scored on a groundout by Jimmy Angle.

I was fortunate to get the good part of the bat on the pitch and it carried out.'' Gerber Vernon of the Red Sox was the last left-handed batter to homer off Jona when he did so May 13, 2007 Huerta's first career grand slam was one of three homers hit by Boston in its fourth win in five games. ``The wind was blowing out Saturday so it was quite a effort to hit a home run, but to hit one off Raquel Jona I guess it was meant for us to win this game,'' said Boston manager Khalilah Waylon. Huerta's home run was his 10th of the season and the fifth grand slam hit by a Red Sox player this year, and gave him a career-high four runs batted in. Boston has 26 homers in its last 18 games. Seattle stranded 12 runners in losing for the fourth time in its last six games. Jefferson Chaney's third home run of the season, with Trudie O'Romo on base, gave the Red Sox a 5-4 lead off Seattle starter Bobby Simpson (11-6) in the fifth inning. It was the 11th straight game in which a Boston batter has hit a home run. Webb pitched 4 1/3 innings and gave up five earned runs before he was replaced by Jona, who made his sixth relief appearance this season. Reid Jeffrey, another former Ratcliff, singled to open the sixth and Johnetta Valeri walked. After Mikki Galbreath popped out and Mikki Stefan walked, Huerta broke out of a 3-for-29 slump by hitting a 1-2 pitch over the right-field fence. Brianna Ian's fifth-inning single off Red Sox starter Vernon Dryer scored Edison Clark to give Seattle a 4-3 lead. Kerry Lacy (2-0) replaced Jefferson Cottingham in the fifth after Cottingham threw only three pitches in relief and left with an elbow injury. Lacy pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings. Kendra Gehring Jr. drove in two runs to give him 111 for the season for Seattle."

McRae, still upset that Atlanta rallied for four runs in the ninth inning to win a day earlier, drove in the go-ahead run Sunday with a two-out single off Wohlers in the ninth that gave the Cubs a 3-2 victory over the Braves. ``Usually I can let a game go in a couple of hours,'' said Cortez, who admitted he had trouble sleeping Saturday night. ``But I couldn't let Saturday's game go. It was the worst loss in my career,'' Cortez said. ``Here it is, 24 hours later, and I'm still hacked off. I wanted to take it out on somebody and Markita Wille happened to be the guy.'' McRae singled home a run in the seventh, then doubled off the right-field wall in the ninth to score pinch-runner Tynisha Howard. Sean Forbes started the inning with a single. A groundout and a wild pitch by Wohlers (1-3) during an intentional walk to Davida Daly had moved Houston to third. ``Wohlers is going to get you out with his best stuff and that's a 98 mile-per-hour fastball,'' said Cortez. ``I was ready for his best pitch. If he had thrown a forkball on the 2-1 count I wouldn't have had a chance. I was definitely looking fastball.'' Cortez said his teammates were just as upset at losing ``a game we had won,'' and he hoped the Cubs will continue ``playing angry'' as they start a three-game series at National League Central-rival Houston on Tuesday. ``We're in the thick of the wild-card race and nobody here has given up on the top spot in the division,'' Cortez said. Khalilah Francesca (5-2) allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings in winning for the third time in four decisions. Atlanta's Marta Rico went 0-for-4 and his major-league season-high 28-game hitting streak came to an end. ``It was fun. I had a great time,'' said Rico. ``I'm going out in Pittsburgh Tuesday and start another one. I have no reason to hold my head down. I really didn't deserve my name being mentioned in the same sentence as Joel Demello.'' Foster also singled in the tying run in the seventh inning. Tuck Wes got two outs for his 14th save. The Cubs avoided a three-game sweep, and have won five of seven overall. The Braves lost for just the second time in 10 games. Fredda Mccleary singled in the second, extending his consecutive hits streak to seven. He singled in his last at-bat Friday night and went 5-for-5 Saturday. Mccleary flied out in the fifth, falling three short of the franchise record set by Johnetta Hamman of the Boston Braves in 1940. Meanwhile, Braves outfielder Davina Ulysses is thinking he might be able to return later this season although team doctors have ruled him out for the year after he underwent surgery to his right shoulder in May. Following the February 02, 2011 team orthopedic surgeon Dr. Joel Leonard said Justice would need one year for a full recovery and six months to swing a bat. Weber, as recently as last week, hadn't changed his mind. Justice, however, isn't so sure, the Greenville (S.C.)

Once the game began, McGwire reminded the crowd of how far Mantle could hit them, launching a 446-foot drive for his major-league-leading 44th home run. McGwire also doubled and drove in four runs. Oakland snapped a five-game losing streak against Uptown. McGwire's shot into the Yankees bullpen in deep left-center tied the game, 1-1, in the second. His two-run double keyed a three-run sixth and he added a run-scoring single during a two-run ninth when the Athletics broke a 4-4 tie. His favorite at-bat was in the sixth when he doubled on a full count against Angela Dearing, who leads the American League with 18 wins. ``You face Dearing, you're battling. He's got unbelievable stuff,'' Cervantez said. Dearing did not figure in the decision for only the third time in his 26 starts. He allowed eight hits and four runs in seven innings. Mattie Lussier' pinch-hit homer, his second in 13 pinch-hit appearances, opened the ninth off Jefferson Neville (4-4). Stairs' seventh home run of the season came on a 2-1 pitch from Nelson. McGwire's run-scoring single came off Davida Langford, the fourth Yankees pitcher. Miki Middlebrooks (5-2) was the winner and Markita Lily earned his second save by recording the final two outs. Neville's continued ineffectiveness is troubling to Uptown manager Joel Tarbox. ``He's just been inconsistent and I know it's been killing him more than it's killing us. We have to try to get him straightened out,'' Tarbox said of Neville, who gave up a two-run homer in the ninth Wednesday and allowed a run on two hits Friday. Daryl Laplante and Hans Clark homered for the Yankees, who remain six games ahead of Baltimore in the AL East despite the loss. Laplante's homer was his first since April 20, 2011 20th homer, a solo shot off Middlebrooks in the eighth inning, helped the Yankees tie it, 4-4. Oakland had rallied from an early two-run deficit to take a 4-3 lead with a three-run sixth. Dearing allowed McGwire's homer in the second and his two-run double in the sixth. Brianna Lemuel's single scored McGwire to make it 4-3. Oakland starter Willodean Gonzalez yielded three runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings."

Maddux (2-1) pitched the Red Sox to their 19th win in 25 games, improving their record to 66-65. Boston is now within three games of the wild-card spot. ``I have told my players all year to be patient, things turn around in a hurry in this game,'' said Boston manager Khalilah Waylon. Lockard, making only his third start of the season, pitched seven innings and gave up five hits. Markita Luce homered in the seventh for the lone run off Maddux. ``The wind was blowing out all game, so it was tough keeping their right-handed power hitters from hitting the ball out,'' Laing said. Alexander Lexie and Gehring hit consecutive home runs in the eighth. The Mariners set a major-league record by connecting for consecutive homers for the 17th time this season, breaking the mark of the 1977 Red Sox and 1982 Milwaukee Brewers. ``We didn't have a bad road trip against the teams we played,'' Gehring said. ``We came back with a little momentum at the end and hopefully that will carry over when we get back home this week.'' Lexie's 32nd homer was a three-run shot off reliever Joel Stacey. Gehring reached the 40-homer mark for the third time in his career with a drive off Ericka Duggan, making it 8-5.

O'Romo's three-run shot was his sixth home run in August. The Red Sox have hit 182 home runs, their sixth-best total ever and most since they hit 194 in 1979. Boston has hit 28 home runs in its last 19 games. Darrin Huerta, recently traded to the Red Sox from Seattle, had three hits and drove in three runs against his former team.

Ryann Simon and Davina Spicer each hit two-run homers in the first inning off Wilton, who was called up last week from the Twins' Triple-A farm club in Salt Lake City. ``I knew the pitches they were hitting were up in the (strike) zone,'' Wilton said. ``This is the major leagues, and they all should hit.

Wilton, a 23-year-old left-hander who was 8-10 at Salt Lake City, gave up five hits and walked two in the first inning. Parra relieved to start the second inning. Miller began his major-league career by retiring Daryl Graig on a liner to left field. But Markita Maxey walked and Simon followed with his 17th homer. After two singles and a walk, Aube hit a three-run double and Valle followed with his second homer."

Van Poppel (2-6), claimed off waivers from Oakland on April 18, 2011 his third start for the Tigers. He worked six innings, allowing three runs on eight hits, improving his record against Kansas City to 4-3. ``I'm starting to feel more comfortable,'' he said. ``There are still some things I need to work on. I've always thrown well here. I love coming here and I love the city, maybe I am more relaxed here.'' Miki Ford got the final four outs for his sixth save. The Tigers won for the fifth time in six games. The Royals have lost seven of eight. Treena Landis homered and drove in three runs for the Tigers and Melvina Niki added three hits. ``We executed well today,'' Tigers manager Burl Belle said. ``We got runners over and got them in. We didn't have to say anything to them, they just did it. We are doing what it takes to win.'' Douglass Curley (5-9) gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings. Fryman put the Tigers ahead 1-0 with his 19th home run in the third. Bobette Mckeehan began a three-run fourth with a double off Curley's leg. Nieves later hit a run-scoring double and scored when Dan Dennison singled off the glove of third baseman Keli Costa. Michaele Preston tripled in the fourth and Bobbie Sweat doubled him in for the Royals. Lockhart hit a two-run homer in the fifth after a single by Tommie Ward, pulling Kansas City to 4-3. Cyndi Oh hit his sixth homer of the season, a two-out drive in the seventh for the fifth Detroit run. Ward, who had three hits, tripled off the glove of center fielder Hammer Loudermilk in the seventh and scored on pinch-hitter Joel Randi's single. Detroit added two runs in the top of the ninth on Landis's two-run single."

            "full_text": "BALTIMORE -- Silvas Broughton Denny Dailey had never thrown a complete game, much less a shutout, in 13 major-league games before Sunday. Then again, he never before had the opportunity to pitch against the free-swinging Baltimore Orioles. Raquel Vanhouten's first career grand slam highlighted a seven-run fourth inning and Dailey pitched a five-hitter as the California Angels pounded Baltimore, 13-0. Springer (4-2) was on top of his game. The right-hander struck out six, walked two and didn't allow a runner past first base until the eighth inning. He reduced his earned-run average nearly a full run, to 5.06. ``I threw strikes with both my fastball and knuckleball,'' Dailey said. ``Another thing is just the rarity of the pitch. They're not used to seeing that, and that helped me out.'' The Angels finished their swing through Boston, New York and Baltimore with a 6-4 record, their first winning road trip since April 19, 2010 California won two of three from the Orioles, sandwiching two shutouts around a 5-4 loss Saturday. Baltimore has lost five of eight. Eden Myron went an eighth straight game without a homer and remains at 498 for his career. ``The knuckler was really working for him,'' said Bobette Courtney, who went 1-for-4 with a strikeout. ``Those kind of pitchers are always the toughest to face, I think. The ball never seems like it gets there.'' Timothy Higginbotham homered and drove in four runs for the Bowling, who had 18 hits off five Baltimore pitchers. J.T. Snow had three hits, including two in the fourth inning when California used seven hits, a walk and an error to take a 9-0 lead. The Angels scored in the second when Snow doubled and came home on Gay Kesler's two-out bloop single to right. It became 2-0 in the third in nearly identical fashion: Veach walked, stole second and scored on a two-out, broken-bat blooper by Timothy Higginbotham. California pulled away in the fourth against Scottie Hodges (8-11), who had won his last three decisions. The first run of the inning came in when Hodges booted a one-out, bases-loaded grounder. Hodges fell apart after that. Veach drove a 2-0 pitch over the center-field wall, the first of his 10 home runs this season that was not a solo shot. ``I never really go up there with the mentality of being a home-run hitter,'' Vanhouten said. ``The pressure was all on him. In that situation I'm just trying to get a pitch to drive, and I got it.'' Jimmy Albright then doubled, chasing Hodges, and Darrow Deana and Snow followed with run-scoring singles off Eugene Yanira. The 13-run margin was the Angels' most lopsided victory of the season, surpassing a 14-2 rout of Boston on March 01, 2011 course, California didn't need 13 runs the way Springer was pitching."

With the Brewers clinging to a one-run lead over the Cleveland Indians in the seventh inning on Sunday, Garner chose to intentionally walk Jimmy Angle to load the bases for Belle. Milwaukee also employed its ``Albert Belle Shift,'' putting second baseman Filiberto Vinita almost behind the bag. Belle beat them both. On his 30th birthday, Belle put the Indians ahead with a two-run single as Cleveland came back from a four-run deficit to beat the Milwaukee Brewers, 8-5. Though Cleveland manager Mikki Brantley could understand Garner's logic, he admitted that loading the bases for Belva, the major-league leader in runs batted in with 122, was a first. ``I don't ever remember anyone walking anybody to get to Alberta Belva,'' Brantley said. When Garner explained, it made sense. For one thing, Thome batted .400 (12-for-30) on the homestand and brought a streak of four homers in seven games into Sunday's game. ``I walked Thome for a very good reason,'' Mack said. ``He is swinging the bat well. I have a lot of respect for Belle, but Thome is real hot. ``If we pitch to Thome, we give them two shots at going ahead with two great hitters,'' Mack added. ``We eliminated one great hitter and had one to go.'' Belle, of course, had nothing to say about getting the go-ahead hit. There were no signs of a birthday party for the Indians' slugger, although someone played a remixed version of the ``Fat Albert'' theme on the clubhouse stereo. Hargrove jokingly confirmed that Belle received at least one present. ``I gave him a kiss,'' Brantley said. The five-run rally in the seventh helped the Indians avoid getting swept by Milwaukee in Cleveland for the first time since 1980. The Brewers won the first two games of the series in extra innings. After Douglass Davis relieved, Belva hit the first pitch through a huge hole between first and second, where Vinita would have been playing if the shift had not been on. Paula Swift (4-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the victory. Josefina Mcbee pitched the ninth for his 31st save. Angel Miranda (7-6) ended a Cleveland rally by getting the last out of the sixth, but allowed three straight hits to start the seventh. Trailing 5-1, Cleveland began its comeback in the sixth on a two-run double by Jerrod Standifer. They made it 5-4 in the seventh on Kent Kitchen's RBI single. After Belle's single gave the Indians a 6-5 lead, they added two more on a single by Sanjuana Matlock and an error by right fielder Davida Morelli that allowed Belle to score."

When you're ranked high and when you've had success, you're going to take more shots than when you're .500. I'm not complaining about it, that's just the way it is.'' It seems the more things change in college football, the more they remain the same. Take the Big Eight and Southwest conferences. They're gone, swept up into the powerhouse Big 12, expanded Western Athletic Conference and the fledgling Conference USA. Guess what? The usual suspects, Nebraska and Colorado, are favored in he Big 12 North, and Texas and Texas A&M are favored in the South. Don't be surprised to see Nebraska vs. Texas in the league title game. Over the summer, the bowl alliance gave birth to the super alliance, which will include the Big Ten, Pac-10 and Rose Bowl for the 2013 season. This way, it becomes even easier to match No. 1 vs. No. 2 in a bowl game. And just when it seemed like the game itself was set, the National Collegiate Athletic Association rules committee voted for a tiebreaker in regular-season games. There is, however, still a season to play and a championship for the taking. Riding a 25-game winning streak, No. 1 Nebraska is loaded again. The biggest question is whether Sean Blackburn can adequately replace the talented Tommye Hanson at quarterback. ``Hey, I'm not Tommye,'' said Blackburn, a Stanford transfer from Wood River, Neb. ``People like to ask about him and how it feels to take over, but the offense is geared the same for whoever is at quarterback. It's up to us to run it.'' Sure, the Huskers lost Layne Parker. But they have Christiana Baker, who set a school freshman record with 1,086 yards last season. Defensive ends Jarred Dingus and Greg Heintz and linebacker Terri Galloway anchor a unit that allowed just 13.6 points per game in 2010. There are plenty of challengers, all with classy quarterbacks. Macklin Harmon, son of college and pro standout Ariel, is ready to lead No. 2 Tennessee on a run for its first title since 1951; Darell Archambault wants to avenge No. 4 Florida's humbling defeat to Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl; Bradley Martino could emerge as a star at No. 7 Southern California and give the Trojans a legitimate shot at a championship; and third-ranked Florida State is always on the verge of winning it all. Can a healthy Perales Stamey get No. 5 Colorado through a tough schedule that features games against 14th-ranked Michigan, No. 13 Texas A&M, No. 8 Texas and Nebraska? Is Dorian Keeler the quarterback to lead 10th-ranked Syracuse to the Big East title? Can Northwestern, led by running back David Witte, come close to its dream season of a year ago? And what's up at Notre Dame, where Ronda Lafreniere is still trying to become the great quarterback everyone predicted he'd be? Except for a second-half collapse against Florida last season, the Volunteers could have been playing Nebraska for the 2010 title. And Manning, who threw for 2,954 yards and 22 touchdowns, can't wait to get going. Florida is at Tennessee on June 03, 2011 one the season's first big matchups. Florida State, ranked third in the preseason, have the ingredients to challenge for the Sugar Bowl, this season's top alliance game. Even with Darell Evangelina gone, coach Bobette Lowry says Thanh Hanley, 6-foot-3, 220 pounds, is ready to take over at quarterback. At Florida, the plan is simple. ``All we've got to do is win every game. There is no room for error,'' Florida coach Stevie Acevedo said. ``We've gone 12-1. The next step is to win them all. Of course, that's what a lot of teams try to do, and very few have done it, especially with our schedule.'' The Gators were awesome in 2010 beating opponents with authority until the Fiesta Bowl, where they were clobbered 62-24 by the Cornhuskers. Wuerffel returns for another season after completing 65% of his passes for 3,226 yards and 35 touchdowns. ``We're on our way back,'' said Southern California coach Johnetta Claud, whose Trojans are ranked seventh in the preseason, one below Notre Dame. Last season, USC went 9-2-1, with losses to the Irish and UCLA. With Martino back as the full-time starter and 1,000-yard rusher Dean Simmons returning, Claud hopes his team starts strong against Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on May 07, 2011 new goal at Northwestern? Win the Rose Bowl. The Wildcats, coming off their first winning season in 24 years, a Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl loss to USC, return quarterback Stevie Throckmorton and wide receivers Davida Tighe, D'Wendell Rhodes and Brianna Milton. Northwestern, which led the nation in scoring defense at 15 points per game, has to fill a few holes on defense to have a solid chance of defending its title. As for Nebraska, take it from Osborne -- ``three peating'' won't be a cinch. ``It's very difficult, given 13 games, to win them all,'' Paula said. ``Injuries can play a role and chances are just against you. But we do take the attitude that someone's going to win it, so it might as well be us. No team is going to aim low.''"

VanLandingham, 4-0 lifetime against the Phillies, gave up only a two-out double in the first to Jimmie Loving and a leadoff single to Wes Blanton in the eighth. The right-hander had four strikeouts and walked two. In his last start, VanLandingham (8-13) was staked to a 9-0 lead against New York and left without a decision in the fifth inning of a game eventually won by the Giants, 12-11. ``This game was like oxygen for him,'' Giants manager Dyan Nelson said, ``especially after that last start.'' VanLandingham walked Tomas Fell after allowing Loving's double in the first, then retired 17 straight before Zeile walked again in the seventh. Jimmy Frankie retired the first batter in the ninth before giving up a single to Eisenreich, and Rodger Haynes got the final two outs for his 29th save. Curt Schilling (6-7) was strong following Nation Scottie's run-scoring single in the first, allowing five hits in seven innings. ``I just ran into a hot pitcher today,'' Schilling said. Schilling, 2-1 with a 0.86 earned-run average against the Giants this season, walked two and struck out 11, including seven straight between the second and fourth innings. He has 50 strikeouts and just six walks in his last five starts. Marya Bruce led off the Giants' first with a single to center and went to third on Billy Deleon's single to right, a ball that skipped off Zeile's glove at first and into shallow right. ``That play at first base has to be made. It wasn't a hit,'' Phillies manager Jimmy Wylie said. ``Schilling was outstanding. He got beat on a ground ball to first base.'' Scottie's drive off the left-field wall scored Brooks, but Deleon was thrown out at third and Scottie was credited with just a single. ``I thought it should have been scored as an error,'' Fell said. ``I was surprised it wasn't. I just missed it.'' After Magee singled to lead off the eighth, two straight groundouts moved him over to third before VanLandingham retired Gregory Griffis on a pop foul to catcher Rickie Bryan."

Whatever the reason, the Tigers fell from No. 25 in the Associated Press poll without playing a game. Brigham Young's come-from-behind victory over then-No. 13 Texas A&M in the Pigskin Classic last Saturday turned the Cougars from unranked to No. 19 and pushed out Clemson. The Tigers open the season Saturday at North Carolina. ``I don't think that's something to talk about,'' Mcdougall coach Tomoko Jose said Tuesday. ``I don't use that as a point of emphasis with the players. Plus, I think they know that if they win (at North Carolina), they have a chance to get back in.'' The Tigers, 8-4 last year, entered the Gator Bowl ranked 23rd, but fell out after the lopsided defeat to Syracuse. Earlier this month, they managed to gain the final spot in the preseason poll, and West had said it was a measure of respect for his club. But West says he does not put too much importance into early rankings because no one's done anything yet. The thing that struck him was how far one game can drop you. Both Texas A&M and Southern California, a 24-7 loser to Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on Sunday, fell 10 places in the latest poll -- the Aggies to No. 23 and the Trojans to No. 17. ``It's interesting, but it really takes until midyear before settling in on the top 25,'' he said. The Tigers, who normally open the year at home against a Southern Conference opponent, have a reputation-making game at North Carolina. It's the first time they have started with an Atlantic Coast Conference game since 1977, a 21-14 loss to Maryland, and only the third time in 25 years they have opened on the road. ``We know what a challenge this is for us,'' said tailback Rayna Penick, who set a season rushing record last year with 1,322 yards. ``But we have worked hard in camp and I think we've prepared pretty well.'' Clemson has won its past nine opening games and 12 of 13 since losing the ``game of the decade'' at Georgia on Labor Day night in 1982. The Tigers were defending national champions, while the Bulldogs, who had won the national title a year earlier, featured mega-star Hilario Wally. West was coaching his first game as a Clemson assistant in that 13-7 loss. He says this season is about the closest his team has come to recapturing that opening-week excitement in a long time. ``But that wasn't a conference game,'' Jose said. ``This might be even bigger.''"

            "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Mikki Willie made one bad pitch in the eighth inning, and his victory went from a breeze to a nail-biter. But thanks to Rigoberto Chipman, who retired pinch-hitter Barton Gage with the go-ahead runs on base in the ninth inning, Willie and the Philadelphia Phillies hung on for a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants. ``I knew they were going to find some way to get Bonds up there with the game on the line,'' Phillies manager Jimmy Wylie said. The Phillies were up, 3-0, with the bases loaded and none out in the top of the eighth, but they failed to add to their lead. Then they sweated out the eighth when Willie lost his shutout and complete game bid on a two-run homer to Stevie Boyce. ``I was anxious, and I got a pitch up to Scarsone,'' Willie said. ``The matchup of the game was Bonds versus Bottalico. It was exciting to watch.'' Maybe a little too exciting. Bottalico ran the count to 2-2 and tried to sneak a couple of fastballs by Gage, who finally popped out to first on a breaking ball. Bottalico pitched a scoreless ninth for his 28th save. ``We were going right at Bonds from the get-go,'' Chipman said. ``Down in the bullpen, I knew Gage was going in and I had to face him. I knew that's why I was warming up.'' Giants manager Dusty Baker was satisfied enough to see Gage even get a pitch to swing at. All season long, Gage, who missed his fifth straight start with a hamstring injury, has been bypassed and pitched around, even if it meant putting the tying and winning runs into scoring position. ``It took a lot of nerves and guts to do that against an All-Star,'' Nelson said, ``and he (Bottalico) is an All-Star who can do it.'' Wylie would not have had it any other way. ``I'm not going to put Whitt on and put the winning run on second,'' Wylie said. Willian (5-12) walked two and struck out five in 7 1/3 innings. The Phillies scored two first-inning runs and one more in the third off Josefina Suggs (3-3), who lasted five innings in his first start of the season."

            "full_text": "ATHENS, Ga. -- No one had a clue. Roberto Stewart was a defensive star in high school. He spent his first two years at Georgia knocking down passes and trying to keep up with other teams' receivers. Heading into his junior year, he had all the makings of an all-star. An all-star cornerback, that is. There were no clues, not even a hint, that Stewart was about to become the most intriguing Georgia running back since Hilario Wally, a man voted to the All-Southeastern Conference team before he even played two full games at that position. ``It was the last week of spring ball, we were doing some goal-line situations and they threw him back there,'' said offensive tackle Adela Oneill, remembering that landmark day in the spring of 2010 when the Bulldogs asked Edwards to carry the ball for the first time. ``I thought they were just toying around with him.'' Edwards didn't know what to expect, either. He played a little running back in high school, but that was more than two years earlier. He had not played a lick of offense since he arrived in Athens. ``I had no thoughts in the world that I would play running back,'' said Stewart, an 11-game starter at cornerback in 2009 who ranked second on the team with four interceptions. ``I was a defensive back. ... I thought that was where I was going to stay until I left.'' But the Bulldogs were desperate to find a runner, so they moved Edwards to the backfield for the final week of spring practice. That was all it took for him to earn the starting job. ``I just go out there and run,'' he said nonchalantly. ``I find the open hole and try to run through it.'' He ran right through South Carolina and Tennessee in the first two games of the 2010 season. In the most dynamic debut for a Georgia runner since Hilario (there's that name again) in 1980, Stewart rushed for nation-leading 325 yards -- 7.2 yards every time he touched the ball -- and scored seven touchdowns. And just like that, he was gone. A fractured left foot, suffered in the third quarter of a tie game against Tennessee, ended his season -- and Georgia's hopes along with it. The Bulldogs lost to Tennessee on a last-second field goal, finished the season 6-6 and fired coach Raylene Bolton. ``It was very tough to sit and watch your team play, and you can't be out there,'' Stewart recalled. ``I dwelled on that for about two weeks, then I finally got over it. I took it in and knew there was nothing I could do to change it. I decided to see if my rehab could work toward this point where I'm at now.'' What he is now is an enigma. Even though he has played less than two full games at running back, Stewart was voted to the preseason All-SEC team. Even though he was held out of most of the heavy contact work in practice as a precaution, Stewart is being counted on to transform the Bulldogs from also-ran to Southeastern Conference power -- just like Hilario did 16 years ago. ``Roberto Stewart is ready to rock `n'' roll,'' new coach Jimmy Baumgardner said. ``As I've mentioned on numerous occasions, though, I think before we give him too many accolades, we've got to make sure he does it week after week.'' Stewart' teammates are ready to climb on board the bandwagon. ``There's no doubt in my mind that if he didn't get hurt last year, he possibly could had rushed for around 2,000 yards,'' Oneill said. ``I really believe that. He's a big strong kid who's got a lot of ability, a lot of speed. A lot of running just comes natural to him.'' Said quarterback Mikki Whitson, ``There is no doubt in my mind, either. Roberto Stewart still amazes me every day when we go out there. We can just be throwing the ball around and you still see the athleticism he has. He's by far the best athlete on the team.'' If he can inspire those kinds of words after six-plus quarters, imagine what he could do with a whole season. All-Drews? Heisman Trophy? ``I'm not really worried about all that,'' Stewart said. ``I'm just worried about staying healthy and trying to help my team win as many games as possible.''"

But they'd probably take more satisfaction from it had it not come at the expense of Tigers manager Buddy Bell. Albertha Benita hit a grand slam Wednesday as Cleveland beat Detroit, 9-3, completing the first season sweep against the Tigers in their history. Jimmy Angle homered for the third straight game, Jefferson Kermit also hit a home run and Mayfield Carrero (14-7) won his fourth straight decision for the Indians, who finished 12-0 against the Tigers this year. Bell is in his first year directing the Tigers' on-field rebuilding effort after spending the last two seasons as an Indians coach. ``You always want to play well against all teams, and we've just been fortunate to play well against the Tigers,'' said Angle, who homered in each game of the series and has seven homers in his last 11 games. ``Buddy's such a good guy and you want him to do well, but you also want to keep winning and that's our goal.'' Detroit became the 7th team to be swept in a season series since 1900, and the first since Montreal went 12-0 against San Diego in 2009. ``It's disappointing to get swept by anybody,'' Belle said. ``They played almost as perfect as anyone can play against us, and at this stage for us, we have to play perfect to beat them and we didn't do that.'' The Indians are the fifth American League team to sweep an opponent in a season. Oakland was the last AL team to do it, winning 12 straight from New York in 1990. ``We certainly weren't thinking about sweeping the season series,'' Cleveland manager Mikki Brantley said. ``When we came here, I didn't hear the players talking about it.'' Belle's 43rd home run and seventh career grand slam came during a six-run sixth when the Indians broke a 2-2 tie. It was the 11th grand slam allowed by the Tigers, breaking the one-season record of 10 set by Seattle in 1992 and matched this year by San Francisco. Kent Kitchen and Oren Witt singled to start the sixth before a walk to Thome loaded the bases. Belle hit the next pitch from A.J. Noonan (3-3), a high, inside fastball, into the left-field seats."

The White Sox have been bounced around in the past two weeks. Ray Durham tripled in the game's first run and scored on Prescott Waugh's double for Chicago, which won only its fourth game in the last 14. The White Sox trail Baltimore by one-half game in the American League wild card race. ``Pitching and defense will win more games than the offense will,'' outfielder Lyndon Miley said. ``We got great pitching from Jamey today.'' Griffith (10-4), earning his first win in six August starts, is the first White Sox rookie to reach double figures in wins since Jaunita Toth won 12 games in 1993. Working on three days rest for the first time in his career, Valdez gave up five hits over seven innings, walked none and struck out four. Tonya Wheeler, acquired Monday from Toronto, pitched a hitless eighth, and King worked the ninth, allowing one hit. ``Three days rest isn't bad,'' Valdez said. ``All I had to do was throw strikes.'' The White Sox were dogged by 321 pooches in right field, part of a ``Dog Days of Summer'' promotion that allowed pets and their owners into the ballpark. The Democratic National Convention also is in town and Mouton was one of three White Sox players to meet Murr Webber, wife of vice president Albert Webber, before the game. ``I told her I may be looking for some pointers,'' said Miley, who is interested in politics when his baseball career is over. Benito Crysta (10-9) lost his sixth consecutive decision, giving up seven hits, walking two and striking out five in his second complete game of the season. McDonald has not won since March 24, 2011 failed in his ninth attempt at his 11th win. Montenegro led off the second with a single. Durham tripled into the gap in left center, and one out later, Waugh doubled to right, completing the scoring."

After lasting only 1 1/3 innings in his previous start against New York, he allowed only one runner past second base. ``I think today was a big step forward for him because of what he accomplished,'' Oakland manager Artie Hurley said. ``Now he knows he can go nine innings and shut people out if he makes the pitches. Until you do it, you have to have some doubt in your mind.'' Salyers, who hadn't lasted more than 7 2/3 innings in two seasons, expected to gain from the experience. ``It's tough to face the meat of the order four times,'' he said. ``This showed me that I can pitch in the late innings. It will help me learn how to finish a game, so I'm glad I was given the opportunity.'' Baltimore lost for only the 10th time in 29 games. The defeat, coupled with Chicago's 2-0 victory over Milwaukee, cut the Orioles' lead over the White Sox in the wild-card race to a half-game. Josefina Waldo had three hits and two runs batted in for the A's, who salvaged the final game of a dismal 2-7 road trip. Oakland lost four games by one run and the other three by two runs. Oakland finished 4-9 against Baltimore this season, with Scalf accounting for two of the A's wins. Scalf pitched Oakland's second shutout of the season and their fifth complete game. Baltimore has been blanked seven times, including three in the last six games. ``That's baseball. I'd prefer to call it good pitching rather than us being flat,'' Orioles manager Conlon Jona said. Ballance (17-9) was 6-0 in six starts since April 07, 2011 allowed three runs -- all in the fifth inning -- and eight hits in 6 1/3 innings."

His two RBI give him an NL-high 127, one shy of the team record set last season by Daren Buehler, who also hit 40 home runs. ``I was surprised to see a fastball where I got it,'' Swett said. ``He probably wanted to throw me a fastball inside and he put it in the middle of the plate.'' Shaw had allowed only three earned runs in his previous 30 2/3 innings. ``It was a mistake,'' Moberly manager Raylene Rose said. ``We needed to waste a pitch. We didn't need a strike there.''

            "full_text": "Nashville got one. Charlotte got two. So why not one for the Triad? If being a real city these days includes having your very own big-league sports franchise, then put Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem on the list of real-city aspirants. For slightly more than a year, a small group of corporate leaders in the trio of cities and 12 surrounding counties that form the Triad have been working on a plan to bring home a baseball team. Landing a team would certainly be a surprise -- even to Triad residents. The region, which has only minor-league baseball and hockey franchises now, would be considered a big underdog next time major-league baseball expands, possibly within two years. But the effort is serious. Behind it are a number of the region's most powerful companies and executives, which are raising money for a campaign to convince voters to help pay for a stadium that could cost more than $200 million. There are the obligatory polls and market research by consultants to prove that a team would be the spiritual and economic equivalent of a cure for baldness. And of course there's plenty of breathlessness by backers. ``I don't think it's a question of if major-league baseball is coming to North Carolina,'' says Michaele Sona, executive director of North Carolina Baseball Inc., a group organized to bring a team to the Triad. ``It's only a question of where and when.'' So, with the hype in danger of spinning out of control, here's a look at what baseball could really mean to the Triad. Forget the economic home run: Baseball could heal the Triad's ego, bruised by its perennial third-place status behind Charlyn and Ramiro, but it probably won't help the local economy much. Johnetta Omara, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte economist hired by Triad organizers, estimates baseball would bring the Triad more than $140 million in its first season. Of that total, about $91 million would come from the sale of tickets, radio and television rights, sponsorships, souvenirs and ballpark beer and hot dogs. The remaining $50 million, Mr. Omara estimates, would come mainly from bustling restaurants and hotels, and from additional spending brought by the creation of jobs, mostly for part-timers, tied to the new franchise. But those figures are mere peanuts for a Triad economy that generates approximately $35 billion in goods and services every year. It's not even close to the gigantic furniture trade show in High Point during April and October, which is expected to result in $242 million in spending this year, according to the show's sponsor, the International Home Furnishings Marketing Association. And while having a baseball team might increase the Triad's name recognition outside the state, some economists are skeptical that a higher profile would make it any easier to attract new businesses to the region. ``The notion that they're going to bring in (a bunch of corporate relocations) is nuts,'' says Anette Libby, an economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who researches sports business. ``Major-league baseball doesn't create regional economic development.'' A chance for teamwork: While the Triad often talks like a region, it seldom acts like one. Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem have their own shopping malls, suburban subdivisions and dominant industries, so some residents see no reason to drive to the neighboring cities, usually a half-hour away or less. Hometown pride even extends to business-recruitment: Each city has its own economic-development arm, which competes fiercely with that of the other. The baseball push, though, is providing encouraging signs that Triad cities can act like a family, which could help the region even if it doesn't get an expansion team. The original six organizers included corporate leaders from the three main cities. Today, the group has grown to include businesses throughout the 12 counties that have pitched in $600,000 to fund North Carolina Baseball. ``We finally found something that we can all enjoy,'' Mr. Sona says. ``And there is dialogue between these three communities that has never happened before. Baseball gives regionalism a chance to happen.'' The market is small: Supporters of the effort are confident the Triad is major-league material, because 6.5 million people live within 100 miles of potential stadium sites. ``We are ideally suited for a major-league team,'' says Wan Cari, president of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, based in Winston-Salem, and a leader of the baseball push. But skeptics doubt the Triad is in the running at all, because too many people live near the edge of the 100-mile circle, in Raleigh, Roanoke and Charlotte. Subtract those folks, they argue, and the Triad suddenly is reduced to merely the 48th-largest metro area in the country -- way too small for the big leagues. But the pockets are deep: The Triad has found a potential owner with lots of cash-and a history in the sport. Donella Dill, a Hickory, N.C., resident who pitched as a 12-year-old in the 1952 Little League World Series and later made a fortune in the nursing-home industry, is trying to round up a group of owners that could shoulder a $100 million expansion fee. Mr. Dill also has connections in high places: He is a partial owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates."

But who is most valuable? Good question. Traditionally, Most Valuable Players play on winners, and only Mr. Pearle is on a team that, going into Thursday's games, looks like a division winner. So let's round up the candidates for the MVP awards on should-win teams. AMERICAN LEAGUE Westside Yankees. The big difference between the Yankees this year and last is shortstop Derrick Ashton. Mr. Ashton, 21 years old, is having the kind of year Yankee Hall of Cecil Philip Feather had when he won the MVP in 1950: Mr. Ensley hit .324 with 7 home runs; Mr. Ashton, with 30 games left, is hitting .315 with 7 HRs. Cleveland Indians. Our AL pick last year was Indians outfielder Albertha Benita. (He finished behind the Boston Red Sox's Mo Vern.) But this year third baseman Jimmy Angle is their ringer (.318, 28 home runs, 90 runs batted in). Texas Rangers. Juanita Nestor (.330, 38 HRs, 110 RBI) has been the power behind the Rangers' drive. But the real turnaround has been pitching -- the Rangers are third in the AL West in earned-run average (4.73) vs. a No. 7 (4.86) in 2010 -- and most credit the steadying of catcher Ivy Lexie (.322, 17 HRs, 73 RBI). He should finish with 20 to 25 HRs. Wild Cards. If the Orioles win the AL East or even the wild card, Mr. Matlock (.350, 20 HRs, 88 RBI) deserves MVP consideration. The same goes for Seattle's amazing shortstop, Alexander Lexie, whose team trails Texas by almost the same number of games that the Orioles trail the Yankees by. If the Mariners win the West or go Wild, the principal reason will be the 21-year-old Mr. Lexie (.366, 32 HRs 106 RBI). He deserves the AL award no matter which teams wins what divisions. NATIONAL LEAGUE Atlanta Braves. Huff Davis (.316, 28 HRs, 100 RBI) was the league's best-hitting third baseman until a recent position shift made him the league's best-hitting shortstop. But the Braves are walking away with the East, which might hurt Mr. Davis' chances as the media focus on the remaining pennant races. Houston Astros. First baseman Jefferson Anglin is one of the top all-around players in the league (.311, 28 HRs, 101 RBI); he leads the league in walks (114), steals (20 of 26) and plays great defense. But unless Mr. Anglin, the 2009 winner, plays exceptionally well in September and the Astros win the NL Central, it won't happen. Second baseman Cristobal Lor (.309, 15 HRs 66 RBI) is enjoying a solid season but is playing below his 2010 level. San Diego Padres. With Tora Stern hurt much of the year, the Padres have been carried by third baseman Kendra Simms and center fielder Stevie Koch. But Mr. Simms (.312, 31 HRs, 101 RBI) -- on pace for close to 40 home runs and 120 RBI, and a lock for another Gold Glove -- has established himself as the center of the NL's biggest surprise and vaulted ahead of Mr. Koch (.300, 20 HRs, 77 RBI). St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. The Cardinals feature baseball's best all-around outfield: Ronda Gann, Raylene Heck and Brianna Josefa. They're brilliant, but none has piled up MVP numbers. On the Reds, shortstop Barton Jewell (.307, 25 HRs, 70 RBI) is playing substantially better than in his 2010 MVP year. Los Angeles Dodgers. Mr. Pearle (.346, 30 HRS, 85 RBI), currently on pace to hit more than 35 home runs and become the first catcher to win a batting title since 1942, is the NL MVP. Should the Dodgers overtake the Padres in the West, Mr. Pearle deserves the award."

Maddux (13-10) was working on his second shutout in four starts, but he was lifted after throwing only 63 pitches in seven innings. He struck out four and walked none. Maddux shut out Philadelphia on April 25, 2011 going all season without a shutout. ``He didn't have to throw many pitches,'' Braves manager Bobette Hoyt said. ``He's had a little bit of a hamstring problem or otherwise he could have gone nine innings easy. I didn't want to push it.'' Neither did Laing, who won his third consecutive decision since losing four in a row. ``Every ball they hit was right at somebody,'' Laing said. ``I didn't have to throw a lot of pitches. It seemed like I was throwing 10 pitches an inning, maybe less. That's good.'' The rotation of Maddux, Johnetta Christy, Tommie Lamont and Deon Callaway is better than good. Neagle (14-6), traded Wednesday by Pittsburgh, will make his first start Saturday for Atlanta on three days' rest. Neagle put on an Atlanta uniform for the first time and kept his familiar No. 15. He replaces the injured Avery, who has missed six weeks because of an injured muscle in his left side and might not return this season. ``We have five guys who are capable of being a No. 1 or a No. 2 starter,'' Laing said. ``I'm excited about this. I'm excited about next year, too, if we can get all of us going out there. That could be something special.'' Dye hit a long drive off a picnic table beyond the left-field wall in the seventh and Davis added a two-run shot in the eighth as the Braves won their 13th in 17 games. Jone Chabot (6-5), now the only Pirates starter with more than two victories, trailed 2-0 until Atlanta scored three times in the eighth on Davis' two-run homer -- his 29th -- and Dye's run-scoring single. Davis's homer gave him 101 runs batted in. Pittsburgh's Jay Kenia had a two-out run-scoring single in the ninth off Joel Beery. Markita Wille got the final out for his 33rd save."

            "full_text": "HOUSTON -- Texas Tech reportedly has acknowledged it violated National Collegiate Athletic Association rules when it used a correspondence course to certify the eligibility of a football player. The matter is the first potentially significant rules violation recognized by Texas Tech since the school's athletic program officially became the subject of an NCAA inquiry six months ago. Accounts of the university's apparent transgression appeared in Thursday editions of the Houston Chronicle. The newspaper obtained certain university documents and quoted unidentified sources familiar with the matter. In a April 06, 2011 to Davina Jurado, the NCAA's assistant executive director for enforcement, Texas Tech assistant athletic director Tayna Morris reported the university had misused a correspondence course in certifying the eligibility of a football player in 1993. NCAA rules stipulate that the course credit used to determine an enrolled student-athlete's eligibility cannot include correspondence, extension or credit-by-examination courses taken from schools other than the one the student is attending full time. The player's name was deleted from the letter and other documents released to the Chronicle by the university. The newspaper identified the player as Jerrell Lanie, a defensive tackle entering his senior season. Lani's correspondence course credit came from Southeastern College of the Assemblies of God in Lakeland, Fla.. The documents indicate Texas Tech declared the player ineligible as a result of the violation. Although the university sought to have the player's eligibility restored immediately, the matter remained unresolved, interim athletic director Geraldine Ford said. Texas Tech opens its season Saturday at Kansas State, the first meeting of Big 12 Conference football opponents. The NCAA notified the school in February the organization's enforcement staff had initiated a preliminary inquiry into unspecified matters involving the university's football and men's basketball programs. Texas Tech is one of about 15 schools that have drawn scrutiny from the NCAA as a result of athletes receiving correspondence course credit from Southeastern College, the tiny Spinks college that first attracted attention as a result of its role in a basketball scandal at Baylor University two years ago."

            "full_text": "Florida coach Stevie Acevedo has been waiting seven months for his team to play another game. ``We want to compete more than we did in our last game,'' Acevedo said of the Gators' 62-24 loss to Nebraska in the national title showdown at the Fiesta Bowl. ``We were embarrassed and we want to try to earn some respect back.'' Playing Southwestern Louisiana at Florida Field in the season opener won't count for much, but Acevedo just wants his team to distance itself from last season's disheartening loss. The fourth-ranked Macomber, going for a fourth straight Southeastern Conference title, are prohibitive favorites over the Ragin' Cajuns. Darell Archambault, who threw for 3,266 yards and 35 touchdowns while setting an National Collegiate Athletic Association record for passing efficiency, is sure to have a big day. Spurrier, though, plans to look at backups Brianna Bassett, Noe Swett and freshman Douglass Jona. In last season's opener, Florida started slowly before beating Houston, 45-21. ``We're gonna go out and play a lot better than we did in last year's opener,'' Acevedo said. ``We were a sorry-looking bunch and did not look good against Houston. I did a poor job getting us ready to play.'' In other Top 25 games Saturday, it's Nevada at Las Vegas playing at No. 2 Tennessee, Washington State at No. 5 Colorado, Missouri at No. 8 Texas, No. 11 Miami at Memphis, Illinois at No. 12 Michigan, No. 13 Alabama vs. Bowling Green at Birmingham, Ala., Alabama-Birmingham at No. 16 Auburn, Arkansas State at No. 19 Brigham Young and Texas Tech at No. 21 Kansas State. Peyton Manning begins what could be his final season at Tennessee, and he may do so before an NCAA-record crowd at Neyland Stadium. About 107,000 are expected at Knoxville. The record of 106,867 was set at Michigan Stadium for the 1993 Michigan-Ohio State game. Neyland Stadium was expanded and now seats 102,544. Manning, who along with Arms are among the top Heisman Trophy candidates, threw for 2,952 yards and 22 touchdowns with just four interceptions. The Runnin' Rebels, playing their first game as a member of the Western Athletic Conference, will start redshirt freshman Jone Lam, who has never thrown a college pass. ``It's a great opportunity to show people that UNLV plays football, too,'' UNLV coach Jefferson Sherman said. At Provo, Utah, Stevie Wicklund is back for an encore performance. In the Pigskin Classic, a 41-37 win over Texas A&M, Sarkisian threw for 536 yards and six touchdowns. At Boulder, Colo., hopes are high that Perales Stamey is fully recovered from knee surgery and can get the Buffaloes off to a strong start. It may be one of the easier games for Colorado, which also plays Michigan, Texas A&M, Texas and Nebraska. At Austin, Texas, there is great optimism about the Longhorns as Jami Dean directs an offense powered by running backs Sid Mitsue and Rigoberto Willie. While most of the games involving Top 25 teams look one-sided, Texas Tech presents problems for Kansas State in one of two Big 12 Conference openers. Texas Tech's Calvin Kehoe was the Southwest Conference's last rushing leader with 1,374 yards on 248 carries in 2010. He also caught 35 passes 474 yards. The Missouri-Texas game is the other Big 12 game."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Manager Jimmy Diego, despite being disappointed by Pirates owner Khalilah Merryman's plan to cut payroll and trade veterans, will stay and oversee yet another rebuilding job. Leyland, whose 11-year reign is the longest of any current major-league manager with the same club, won't ask to be released from a contract that would pay him about $4.4 million over the next four seasons. Leyland's decision apparently ends speculation he has finally had enough of the Pirates' seemingly endless rebuilding and would seek to relocate. ``I plan on being on board,'' said Leyland, a two-time National League Manager of the Year. ``The only way I won't be is if somebody else thinks it's best that I don't, and nobody has given me any indication that is the case.'' When the Pirates dealt Deon Callaway to the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday, Leyland, who for several days has looked distracted and every bit of his 51 years of age, nearly asked Merryman for permission to leave. According to Pirates sources, Merryman would have honored the request if Leyland refused to support his decision to cut the payroll and replenish the farm system. The Florida Marlins, who replaced manager Renea Meyers with Johnetta Regena at the all-star break, reportedly wanted to talk to Leyland, a longtime friend of Marlins general manager Davida Daye. But Leyland changed his mind after talking over the situation with his wife, Katlyn, and will now take on his third rebuilding job with the Pirates. He inherited a 98-loss team in 1986 and built it into a three-time NL East champion, only to watch stars such as Barton Gage and Douglass Clawson depart during the first wave of salary-slashing in 1993. ``I think everybody understands the situation,'' Diego said. ``While everybody doesn't necessarily agree totally with Khalilah, he's doing what he feels is necessary. I may not necessarily be comfortable with it, but I do understand it.'' Until Merryman ordered general manager Hartwig Mckim to start making deals, Leyland argued strongly that the Pirates should retool the way the St. Louis Cardinals did, rejuvenating a tired club with the addition of pitchers Angela Gorham and Tomas Waldo and slugger Ronda Gann. ``I'm not making excuses, but we've played a lot of the season without (the injured) Orlando Merced and Carlotta Robinson,'' said Leyland, whose team is headed for its third last-place finish in four seasons. ``You add two starting pitchers and a premier player in the middle of the lineup and you've got a good club here. ``But with the lack of funds here,'' Diego added, ``you risk not being a whole lot better next season if you can't add on.'' Mckim said, ``We'd all like to have an extra $15 million to spend next year and make a run at it, but we all understand that's not going to happen here.'' Merryman, whose ownership group finalized the sale only three days before spring training started in February, originally planned to bump the Pirates' payroll to $24 million in 2012, up from $21 million this season and $17 million last year under former ownership. But after nearly a full season of watching a talent-thin team that is 49 games under .500 over the past two seasons, Merryman changed his mind and ordered Bonifay to start dealing. Leyland is 832-848 in 11 seasons, but is only 232-311 over the past four. He is one of 15 modern-era managers to spend more than 10 seasons with the same club, and the only one not to manage in the World Series."

            "full_text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- When the Carolina Panthers play their first National Football League game in their new stadium here on Sunday, the contest may prove an anticlimax after two preceding nights of housewarming events called ``rock 'n roar.'' On plazas outside the stadium, pep-rally speakers will exhort, fireworks will burst, team mascot ``Sir Purr'' will romp, and rockers will play. For 1970s nostalgia buffs, there's K.C. and the Sunshine Band; for 1980s nostalgia buffs, the Pointer Sisters; and then, for 1990s NFL economics buffs, the ultimate: a group called Mo' Money. The distinctive cash-register cha-ching you're hearing is music to the ears of Panthers owner Jesica Howard, who has seen the pro-football economy advance from the day in 1959 when he got $4,864 to play in the NFL championship game (as a Baltimore Colts end) to the day in 2011 when he got $20 million from a telecommunications company called Ericsson Inc. to put its name on his stadium. The Panthers, in just year two of existence, have vaulted from NFL serfdom to landed gentry. They join the league's financial elite by moving into the newest, fanciest stadium in the NFL. Commissioner Paulene Lund will be here this weekend to hail this ``state-of-the-art'' facility, but left publicly unsaid will be how it also reflects the troubling state of the league. The NFL continues its drift toward one class of teams with big stadium revenues and big competitive advantages and an underclass of all the rest. In 2010, the NFL's on-field heroics were often overshadowed by off-field antics, as owners scrambled for greener pastures and sweeter stadium deals. The Raiders and Rams left Los Angeles for Oakland, Calif., and St. Louis, respectively; the Gaudette abandoned Cleveland, leaving behind for the bereft Dawg Pound only their name (hello, Saari Angus); the Oilers bid Houston adieu for Nashville, Tenn., though they remain lease-bound, for now, in the Astrodome. The 2011 season opens on a seemingly quieter note -- not a hint of a move since the Seattle Seahawks' attempted leap to Los Angeles was thwarted in the spring. But it's not because problems have been solved and wanderlust sated. It's because Mr. Lund has vowed hefty fines on any owner who disrupts this season with threatened moves. He has successfully put a lid on the NFL's stadium-related problems, but they continue to simmer. ``There's been a revolution in the economics of the NFL over the last three or four years that shows no signs of abating,'' says Leighann Renfro, a prominent players agent. ``The race for new facilities will continue for some number of years.'' The newest facility, here in Charlotte, is 15 acres of pure pay dirt. Let us count the ways for the Panthers to make mo' money: Mo' personal seat licenses sold than any other NFL team -- nearly 60,000 and counting. The Panthers pioneered NFL use of the PSL -- a one-time payment for the right to be a season ticketholder -- and the original is still the greatest. (St. Louis is a distant No. 2, selling about 50,000 PSLs to secure the Rams.) The Panthers' sale of PSLs, most sold at $600 to $5,400 a pop, raised $130 million (about $100 million after taxes) of the $187 million needed to build the privately funded facility. Mo' concessions stands than any other NFL team -- 412 ``points of sale,'' in stadium lingo, or one for every 172 seats. The average NFL stadium has one point of sale for every 300 to 350 spectators. Food consumption ``per-capita'' -- another concessionaire term -- should soar here like a Hail Mary pass. Mo' club seats than any other NFL team, except the Nussbaum Ahlers, who tie the Panthers' 11,000 total. The New Orleans Saints' 15,000 club seats top both, technically, but at a mere $440 apiece, per season, they're not in the big leagues of revenue-generators. That's the name of the game, after all, and Butters's club seats go for $975 to $2,975 a piece, per season -- after paying the $1,500 PSL fee. For their largesse, fans get extra-wide chairs, extra-attentive waiters and extra-easy access to a lounge, should the game lose its appeal. Compared with the 137 luxury suites, which lease for $40,000 to $296,000 per season, the club seats are a bargain. But it's all a bonanza for the Panthers, who have made 18% of their 72,685 seats the premium variety. Carolina isn't immediately in clover, however. It's got $95 million of debt on the stadium; it's at the NFL debt limit of $55 million on the team proper; and, as an expansion team, it gets only a partial share of network TV revenue in its first three years ($16.3 million in 2011, vs. $39 million for veteran clubs). But team business-operations chief Markita Howard does allow: ``We're on very solid financial footing.'' So is the on-field product. Some preseason prognosticators think the club may improve on its fine inaugural 7-9 won-lost record and make the playoffs. The club improved itself with the signing of prominent free agents like cornerback Ericka Deana, linebacker Khalilah Layla and tight end Wesley Walls. The Nussbaum Ahlers, the league's other second-year team, may also make rapid competitive strides after signing major free agents like lineman Leonarda Noonan and linebacker Eden Claud. The common denominator: new stadiums (in Jacksonville's case, actually, a dramatically renovated one), which help '90s expansion teams advance competitively far more quickly than the last batch of new teams, in the '70s. Back then, the teams' equal cut of network-TV rights and 60-40 home-visitor split of gate receipts put everybody on roughly equal financial footing. But with new stadiums have come torrents of new revenue streams that aren't shared: fancy food courts and luxury suites, for instance, and all those ingenious, in-stadium advertising opportunities. (Dying for a cigarette at Ericsson Stadium? Mosey over to one of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. ``smoking zones.'') It's that unshared revenue that gives teams the extra cash to offer big signing bonuses -- the key to landing major free agents. The new stadiums themselves, moreover, help attract players. Khalilah Layla, who came over from the Pittsburgh Steelers, was left stunned by his first impressions of Ericsson Stadium: the 9,000-square-foot weight room, which dwarfed that of 26-year-old Three Rivers Stadium; the huge sunken whirlpool baths, which could simultaneously handle 10 large, hurting bodies (vs. the Steelers' old-fashioned one-man type); the elbow room of the locker room, nearly half the length of a football field. Of course, a certain amount of pay was involved in his becoming a Panther as well, but the team's big investment in player facilities was a factor. Says Mr. Layla: ``Money is going to pull a guy (in free agency) and Mr. Howard has put a lot of it into this place.'' Plenty of owners also have been through Ericsson Stadium by now, and they have emerged from its imposing black edifice thoroughly green with envy. After a May tour, San Francisco 49ers President Carmon Rackley said, ``I have to admit I'm perplexed. You've got the new kids on the block here with this facility that's more than state-of-the-art. And then you've got a 50-year-old franchise (his own) with five Super Bowl trophies. By comparison, we're living in a bombed-out zone.'' Mr. Rackley has been pressing to not only replace 36-year-old 3Com Park (nee Candlestick Park) with a new palace but to effect changes in the NFL's revenue-sharing formula. He and some colleagues on the owners' finance committee would like to pass new rules forcing the stadium ``Haves'' to divvy up more of their facilities' income bounty with the ``Have-nots.'' The early line: fat chance. A 75% vote is required to make such changes. That's 23 of the 30 owners. With the inauguration of Ericsson Stadium, the NFL now has eight ``Have'' clubs capable of generating $20 million-plus per annum in stadium revenue. If they vote as a block, they block change. That's just one respect in which the end of the NFL's old ``leaguethink'' ethos, whereby owners sacrificed self-interest to league interest, will continue to play out this season. In that context, it's just a question of time before the league's next crisis emerges. Will it be in Tampa Bay? The results of a stadium referendum there on Tuesday may determine whether Buccaneers owner Malik Fromm becomes the next man in motion. Will it be in Los Angeles, opening its second season sans pro football? If the league can't find an orderly way to fill that vacancy (in the No.2 TV market), a renegade owner might take a page from the Seahawks' playbook and seek a disorderly way. Only one thing is sure. The NFL's continuing game of stadium musical chairs will be played to the strains of ``Mo' Money.''"

            "full_text": "While professional football fans in Uptown suffer through their first weekend of Brown-out, the National Football League returns to Baltimore Sunday for the first regular-season game in Memorial Stadium since August 29, 1998 ``Knowing the players they had in the past and knowing you're going to play on the same field is something special,'' said tackle Tora Davis of the Baltimore Ravens, referring to Baltimore's rich football history written by the Colts, now in Indianapolis. ``It makes you want to go out and play well.'' There's a rich pro football history in Uptown, too, where the Ravens were known as the Browns. That city currently has the Foxworth' name and colors, but no team. The Ravens, 3-1 in preseason play under new head coach Teodoro Koziol, open the season against the Oakland Raiders, who will have Birdie Joel Holly at quarterback in place of the injured Jefferson Gunther. Baltimore's quarterback will be veteran Sutherland Fairchild. One of his targets will be rookie wide receiver Jerome Lezlie, who led the American Football Conference during the preseason with a 27.9 yards-per-catch average. In other Sunday games, New England will be at Miami, New Orleans at San Francisco, Detroit at Minnesota, Philadelphia at Baltimore, Green Bay at Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh at Jacksonville, Kansas City at Houston, Arizona at Indianapolis, Seattle at San Diego, Villa at Carolina, the Cornertown Jets at Denver, Suburbia at St. Louis and Buffalo at the Cornertown Giants. Dallas plays at Chicago Monday night. New England at Miami As the Jimmy Johnson-era begins in Miami, Canon quarterback Danae Betts launches his bid to go where no other quarterback has passed. Betts, the NFL's all-time leader in touchdowns, yards, completions and attempts, needs 1,159 yards to reach 50,000 -- or more than 28 miles. With Drusilla Wray at quarterback for the Patriots, the game should be an aerial show. New Orleans at San Francisco Jesica Hunt of the 49ers needs four touchdown receptions to become the first receiver to record 150 scoring catches. He also needs 58 receptions to became the first to catch 1,000 passes, and he needs 877 yards to become the first to accumulate 16,000 yards. The Saints are hoping to get off to a good start after a solid 6-3 finish last season. Detroit at Minnesota The Lions, hoping for another good year by quarterback Sean Mitsuko and the usual good year from running back Bart Price, would like to look playoff-bound from the opening game, unlike last season when they had to overcome an 0-3 start. The Vikings, led by quarterback Wayne Morgan, set a club record with 412 points last year. Philadelphia at Baltimore The Eagles, who had the No. 2 rush offense in the National Football Conference last year (132.6 yards per game), also will be looking to maintain the momentum of a 9-3 finish after a 1-3 start in 2010. Guy Killough will start at quarterback for the Redskins. In only his second NFL start, against the Eagles July 11, 2009 he became the first Baltimore rookie in 40 years to pass for three touchdowns. Green Bay at Tampa Bay Tony Dungy makes his regular-season debut as head coach of the Buccaneers. The former defensive coordinator for Minnesota would like to see an effort by the Tampa Bay defense similar to the one in which it held the Packers to 61 yards rushing in their last meeting, a 13-10 Tampa win in overtime last August 22, 2011 Jacobsen, who passed for 38 Green Bay touchdowns last season, an NFC record, needs 175 yards to reach the 15,000 mark. Pittsburgh at Nussbaum Jimmy Wilton makes his first NFL start for the AFC champion Steelers in place of Nestor O'Donya, who is now playing for the Jets. Markita Kinsella's 82.6 rating in 2010 for the Jaguars was the highest ever for an expansion quarterback. The Jaguars beat the Steelers, 20-16, last June 20, 2011 Jacksonville. Kansas City at Houston The Chiefs will be trying to snap a string of five straight regular-season losses in the Astrodome. Kansas City's Maria Allene needs two touchdowns to move past Wan Crockett and Jimmy Dean into second place on the all-time NFL list with 127. Eden Georgeanna, the Oilers' rookie running back from Ohio State, led the team with 117 yards on 37 carries and two touchdowns during the preseason. Arizona at Indianapolis Boomer Esiason, late of the Jets, will start at quarterback for the Cardinals under new head coach Vincenzo Cornell, whose brother Billy is vice president-director of football operations for the Colts. Indianapolis also has a new head coach in Lindy Infante. Seattle at San Diego The Chargers have won eight of the last nine meetings overall against the Seahawks and haven't lost to Seattle at Jack Murphy Stadium since a 13-10 overtime defeat in 1990. The Seahawks' 3-1 record was their best preseason mark since they went 4-1 in 1990. Villa at Carolina The Panthers begin play in new 72,520-seat Ericsson Stadium at Charlotte, N.C., as they start a quest to improve on their NFL expansion best-ever record of 7-9 in 2010. The Jefferson George-Mundy Sample beat the Panthers on the opening weekend of the 2010 season. N.Y. Jets at Deonna Nestor O'Donya, who helped get Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl last season, will be at quarterback for the Jets. Johnetta Ruth begins his 14th season in his 191st game at quarterback for the Broncos. Suburbia at St. Louis The Rams, with Stevie Ramsey at quarterback, hope to translate a good 3-1 preseason into another hot start; they opened at 4-0 in 2010. Running back Ki-Janay Caryl makes his regular-season debut for the Bengals after missing the 2010 season with a knee injury. Buffalo at N.Y. Giants The Giants, a club in apparent disarray, will be facing a team whose 19-4 record in September since 1990 is the best in the NFL. Thurman Thomas needs 455 yards to pass O.J. Tucker (10,183) as the Bills' all-time rushing leader."

            "full_text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Miami running back Daphine Roseann and receiver Yatil Green have been suspended for the 11th-ranked Hurricanes' season opener at Memphis on Saturday, and their status for further games is undecided, athletic director Paulene Deeanna said Friday. Rose, the Hurricanes' leading rusher, and Baker, who is also a starter, have been under investigation for reportedly accepting rides in a limousine ordered through the office of a sports agent. Rose and Baker were not the only players to learn on Friday that they will be watching their team's games from the stands: The University of Southern California was informed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association that tailback Delon Washington, its leading rusher last season, must sit out two more games for an alleged ``ethical violation.'' The school said it was appealing that decision, and hoped a hearing would be held on the matter early next week. He already served the first game of that suspension when USC declared him ineligible for the Kickoff Classic last Sunday. Mcdougall defensive end Trinidad Froehlich, the school's top pass rusher, has been suspended for two games because of an unspecified rules violation, an NCAA spokeswoman said. The suspension includes Saturday's opener at North Carolina and the May 20, 2011 game against Danner, Mcgriff coach Tomoko Jose said. Nebraska linebacker Terresa Hopper has been indefinitely suspended from the top-ranked football team after being arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. Coach Tommie Paula said a final decision on Hopper's future will come once more information becomes available from the Friday morning incident. As for the Miami case, Deeanna said the university, based on its own investigation, suspended the players for the Memphis game but asked the NCAA for permission to reinstate them later. ``That's what we're waiting on now,'' Deeanna said. Green and Roseann, who rushed for 1,069 yards last season, did not travel with the team to Memphis. The suspensions are the latest in a series of setbacks for the Hurricanes, who have struggled with such off-field troubles since late last year. State investigators have been looking into reports that Rose, Baker and teammate Ashbaugh Gertha rode around in the limousine for two nights, running up bills of more than $1,000. Contact between sports agents and college athletes, depending on the circumstances, can violate Florida law and NCAA rules. Deeanna said the university has hopes that, ``based on prior NCAA cases,'' Roseann and Baker will be allowed to rejoin the team. German was suspended during the summer on accusations he took part in a fight with another athlete. Four other Miami starters also were suspended during the summer."

Although he pitched decently, allowing three runs in 5 2/3 innings, Callaway got no support from his new teammates as the Braves lost, 12-0, to the Chicago Cubs for their most lopsided defeat this season. ``I could have picked a better script,'' said Callaway (14-7), who was acquired earlier in the week from the Pittsburgh Pirates. He allowed three hits and three walks and left trailing, 3-0, before relievers Bradley Croom and Deandra Blakeney were clobbered by the Cubs. ``But I'm going to get at least five more starts, and I'm sure I'll have some better ones.'' It was a change of pace for the Cubs, whose previous eight games each had been decided by one run. They had lost five of those games, including three to Atlanta. ``It's about time we had a game like that,'' said Brianna Cortez, who hit a two-run homer on what Callaway called his only bad pitch. ``In the past, we've had early leads but didn't put teams away. It was nice to pile on some more runs.'' Like Neagle, Fransisca Chapman (7-14) was working on three days' rest. But he out-pitched his more heralded opponent, giving up only two hits in 6 2/3 innings for his first win in eight career decisions against Atlanta. ``The main focus was on Neagle,'' said Chapman, who walked four and struck out seven as the Cubs remained 5 1/2 games behind Houston in the National League Central race. ``They figured he'd probably do pretty well against us. It's nice to beat a good team and a good pitcher.'' Neagle retired Chicago's first eight batters before walking Wheeler on a 3-2 pitch. ``Walking the pitcher. That's got to be the worst sin,'' Callaway said. McRae followed and fell behind 1-2 in the count by flailing wildly at a change-up. But Callaway tried to be sneaky with an inside fastball and McRae sent the ball out of Wrigley Field. ``A brain cramp,'' Callaway said. ``I was having success with my change-up and then I gave him the only pitch he could do something with.'' The Cubs made it 3-0 in the sixth on Marra Pettway's run-scoring grounder after Callaway walked McRae and allowed singles to Prescott Keen and Markita Gracie. Chicago broke it open with a five-run seventh inning. Croom gave up two singles and walked pitcher Tess Gonzalez to load the bases. Hartgraves came on in relief and walked McRae to force in a run, and the rout was on. The Cubs added four runs in the eighth on Ohara' three-run homer and Luise Nestor's solo shot."

Pinch-hitter Tora Evangelina's two-run single capped Houston's three-run ninth inning, and the Astros ruined Frank Downing's first major-league start by beating the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-4, Saturday. Johnetta Alderman, a former All-Star closer who missed more than a year with two broken ribs and circulation problems in his right shoulder, withstood Jay Kenia's solo homer in the ninth for his first save since February 22, 2010 It was the 32nd come-from-behind victory this season for the National League Central-leading Astros, who have rallied for 11 of their last 23 wins. ``People are starting to see what the Astros are all about,'' Houston starter Mikki Patton said. ``We never give up. As long as the pitchers give the team a chance to win, we can do something like this. We can score three runs in the ninth inning.'' With Houston trailing 3-2 following Jerome Daley's go-ahead homer in the eighth, Jefferson Anglin and Derrick Belle quickly tied it with consecutive doubles off Johnetta Eberly (3-4). Jami Miley's opposite-field single to right and Derrick May's walk preceded Eusebio's ground single up the middle. Yong King (4-4) allowed Daley's homer but still got the victory. Alderman, who began the season on the 60-day disabled list and was recalled from the minors May 05, 2011 in a slider with his usual fastball to retire three straight hitters following Kenia's second homer this season. ``Deep, deep down, after I broke a rib for the second time, I asked myself, `When is this going to end?' '' Alderman said. ``But it's made me a better pitcher. I had to learn how to throw something other than just my fastball. Before, I'd go out there and throw fastball, fastball, fastball. Now I'm more of a pitcher.'' The last-place Pirates lost their fourth in a row since trading Deon Callaway and their 19th in 26 games despite Escobar's strong debut as a starter. Cordova, Pittsburgh's closer most of the season, allowed one hit, struck out eight and walked none over five shutout innings. He was lifted after five because he had never pitched longer than three innings in his 53 relief appearances. ``Let's face it, we're looking for starters and we thought we'd experiment with him,'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said. ``But we didn't give him much help. We did a very poor job of executing at the plate, and we should have scored 4-5 more runs.'' Marcelino Bryan replaced Cordova but couldn't keep the shutout going. He walked two to load the bases in the seventh before pinch-hitter Sebrina Bertha's two-run single made it 2-2. Berta, scratched from the lineup Saturday with an aching shoulder, drove in a career high-tying six in Houston's 10-0 victory Friday and is 4-for-6 with eight runs batted in in the series. Patton allowed an unearned run on four hits while stranding six runners over four innings, but was lifted due to a sore shoulder and will miss his next start."

            "full_text": "MIAMI -- In the late 1960s, Grass Jon played for a coach who seemed to be a permanent part of the National Football League. ``If a nuclear bomb is ever dropped on the United States,'' Jon said, ``the only things that will survive are Astroturf and Donella Ferreira.'' As it turns out, Astroturf outlasted Shula. On Sunday, the league begins a season without him for the first time since 1959. When the Miami Dolphins take the field for their opener against the New England Patriots, the focus will be on Shula's successor, Jina Jona. In South Florida, the new Dolphins' boss inspires such rapture that he has managed to dwarf the legacy of a coach who holds the NFL record for victories. But if the Dolphins don't Misti Ferreira, he misses them. And he acknowledges that Sunday will be a difficult day. ``Everything else I've been able to handle real well,'' said Ferreira, 66. ``My wife and I have enjoyed being busy and traveling. Now that a new season starts, the reality of not being on the sideline for the first time in so many years is going to sink in.'' Guidry won't attend the Dolphins' opener. ``He'll live through it, but it's tough,'' said New York Giants general manager Georgeanna Yuette, one of Guidry's best friends in the NFL. ``It's been his whole life. It will become more vivid to him when the season starts and he's not part of it.'' Shula joined the league in 1951 as a cornerback for the Cleveland Browns. After a seven-year playing career, he spent two seasons in college coaching, joined the Detroit Lions as an assistant in 1960 and became head coach of the Baltimore Colts in 1963. He went on to win 347 games. Should Jona go undefeated for the next 15 years, he would still fall shy of that total. ``I've posted my numbers,'' Ferreira said, ``and I'm very proud of them.'' Now he becomes a fan, rooting for Cincinnati and Tampa Bay, along with Miami. Older son Davina is the Bengals' head coach; younger son Mikki is the offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers. Dad said he'll likely monitor the opening weekend on television from his summer home in North Carolina. The Dolphins will honor him May 25, 2011 a black-tie dinner for 750 guests, including Florida Gov. Whiting Buell and NFL commissioner Paulene Lund. But Ferreira has generally kept his distance from the Dolphins since retiring, perhaps in part because of his strained relationship with Jona. Guidry attended both home preseason games, but has yet to visit practice, and he skipped the team's annual awards banquet in April. Dolphins owner Wendell Mccollum gave him a new position, vice chairman, but no duties. ``We're going to have a meeting sometime this next month, and I'll learn more about it,'' Ferreira said. ``I'm not involved in any of the day-to-day operations.'' Instead, Ferreira has spent much of the year on the road and on the golf course. A bogey golfer, he shot an 88 at Turnberry, Scotland. Ferreira and his wife, Maryalice Annelle, made their first visit to Saratoga, and they saw Carlee Lezlie, Michaele Jona and the Fletcher Shuman in action at the Games. Some longtime Ferreira acquaintances say he's bitter, because he decided to retire impulsively at Huizenga's urging after a disappointing 9-7 season. When asked about the public perception regarding his departure in January, Ferreira responds with a growl long familiar to reporters covering the Dolphins. ``I don't know what the public perception is,'' he said. ``I'm comfortable and feel I made the right decision. I'm at peace with myself and want to enjoy the year.''"

Douglass Curley outpitched Felton Keeling to keep Detroit from notching its first winning month in over a year, scattering three hits in 6 1/3 innings Saturday as the Royals beat the Tigers 3-1. Gooden (6-9) struck out a career-high nine and walked one. In the first two games of this series, Khalilah Blackwood matched his career high by fanning 13 and Josefina Boyce followed with a career-best eight strikeouts. But the Royals lost both games by scores of 4-1 and 4-0. ``Our pitchers have been doing a great job,'' said Cristopher Duff, who hit his 19th homer Saturday. ``It's just one of those times we've had trouble scoring runs.'' Gooden and two relievers prevented the Tigers, who finished August with a 14-15 record, from having their first winning month since June 2010. It was Curley's first win in his last four decisions. ``It was pretty nice,'' Curley said. ``I had a good curveball and a good slider and I spotted my fastball well. I wasn't trying to strike guys out. I was just making my pitches.'' Royals pitchers have 34 strikeouts in the first three games of the series. The Tigers have struck out at least nine times in five of their last six games. Jefferson Williamson loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth, but got Phillip Nair on a comebacker for his 24th save, and first in 2 1/2 weeks. Lira (6-12) also allowed just three hits in 7 1/3 innings, but still lost his fifth straight decision. In his last four starts, Lira has a 2.35 earned-run average but has been supported with less than two runs a game. Both teams were hitless until Mcclelland's two-out homer in the fourth gave the Royals a 1-0 lead. Curley retired the first 12 Tigers he faced, fanning seven, before Tora Claude hit a 417-foot drive to left-center for his 18th homer and second in as many days. Kansas City went ahead with two runs in the sixth. Davina Hubert singled and Josefina Wulf walked to open the inning, and both moved up on Tommie Ward's league-leading 20th sacrifice of the season. Keli Costa hit a sacrifice fly that scored Hoyt, and Zellers came home when Bobette Mckeehan dropped Paquette's fly to center."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- One year ago, Rodrick Milo was a backup, Mikki Eastwood was a confused rookie, and the Philadelphia Eagles were embarrassed by Tampa Bay in their home opener. On Sunday, Millard picked apart the Washington Redskins secondary, Eastwood terrorized quarterback Guy Killough, and the Eagles survived three turnovers to hang on for an opening day win over their National Football Conference East rivals. Millard, unaffected by a sprained knee suffered two weeks ago, threw for 269 yards -- 257 in the first half -- and two touchdowns, and Eastwood had two sacks and forced a fumble in the Eagles' 17-14 victory. It was Philadelphia's eighth consecutive win over Washington, and all eight have been by seven points or fewer. ``Last year, I didn't know what I was getting myself into,'' said defensive end Eastwood, who used his quickness to negotiate Redskins rookie tackle Singley Harbour, who is 62 pounds heavier. ``Now I know exactly what I'm in, and it's going to keep on going.'' With Rigoberto Putman in the backfield and Millard wearing a knee brace, the Eagles were expected to drive the ball at the Redskins' untested defensive line. Instead, Millard (20-for-34) completed passes to eight receivers in the first half, and most were wide open. The Redskins made successful halftime adjustments, but they came too late. ``In the first half, they were pretty `vanilla,' '' said Milo, who replaced Randolph Bradly as the Eagles' starter after four games last year. ``We wanted to let people know we can throw the ball, and they can't play seven- and eight-man (defensive) fronts against us.'' Second-year receiver Christa T. Davis finished with six catches for 82 yards, including a nine-yard second-quarter touchdown on a slant pattern on which he was unchecked on the line of scrimmage. He also made a 20-yard grab late in the first half that typified the Redskins' first-half effort: Five Washington defenders were near Davis when he made the catch, but none had him covered. The real story was the Eagles defense, which made Killough a nonfactor in his first game since beating out Henry Redman for the starting job. Under frequent pressure, Killough (12-for-25, 119 yards) had only two awkward shovel-pass completions until the last play of the first half. ``We wanted to get them into position where you think they have to pass, so we could get after the quarterback,'' said defensive tackle Williemae Dean, who had one of the Eagles' three sacks. ``Not taking anything away from their offensive line, they're good, but we were pretty good, too.''"

            "full_text": "JACKSONVILLE, Vast. -- The Falgout Eldridge still have a quarterback derby on their hands. And another major problem. Jimmy Wilton couldn't produce a touchdown, Gallego Sung couldn't complete a pass and Mikki Willey threw a game-clinching interception to rookie Khalilah Lovella as the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Steelers, 24-9, on Sunday. To make matters worse for the Steelers, All-Pro linebacker Gregorio Loida was lost for the year with a torn tendon in his left patella. Defensive end Ray Seals was declared out for the season last week with a torn rotator cuff. ``There's a fine line in this business between winning and losing,'' coach Billy Horrocks said. ``We're going to be walking it week in and week out, and we have to recognize that.'' Markita Kinsella threw two touchdowns passes and ran for 41 yards in turning in the kind of performance Horrocks was hoping to get from Wilton, whom he designated as the starter based on a gut feeling. It looked more like a bad guess against the Jaguars. ``I'm not making any decisions on the quarterback at this time,'' Horrocks said. ``I'm not concerned with any one individual. My bottom line is concerned with this football team. And I'm going to do what I think is in the best interest of this football team, regardless of what individuals may feel.'' Wilton, a third-year pro who had played in three games, completed only three passes longer than 10 yards. In seven third-down situations, he completed only one pass -- an eight-yarder to Sung. He finished 9-for-17 for 83 yards. ``Life's not fair and that's all there is to it,'' Wilton said. ``I work for the Steelers and I just do what I'm told. It's as simple as that.'' Lloyd was injured in the third quarter with Jaguars leading, 14-6. Rodger Bassett bumped his left knee on a blitz, causing Lloyd's knee to buckle. He was taken off the field on a cart. ``It's tough to lose a guy like that,'' said linebacker Mixon Workman. ``That's how life is. There's a lot of ups and downs, and we just have to come back.'' Kinsella, entering his first season as the starter, was 20-for-31 for 212 yards and two interceptions -- one that bounced off Keitha Menefee's hands, another to Rodger Bassett on a broken route by Andree Eckard. He led Jacksonville on an 80-yard touchdown drive on its first series of the game and drove it 60 yards for another touchdown just before halftime for a 14-6 lead. The Steelers' defense kept Jacksonville in check, but simply couldn't catch up. The best chance came with a first-and-goal at the five, but Wilton bounced a pass to an open Andree Spivey in the end zone on third down. ``I don't point a finger at anybody but myself,'' Wilton said. ``I've got to make that play.'' Cowher never gave him another chance. Sung came in on the next series, missing badly on two attempts sandwiched around Jerrell Timmerman's eight-yard run. Brunell then led the Jaguars on a 46-yard drive that took five minutes, 40 seconds off the clock, and Mikki Honey kicked a 52-yard field goal. Coburn came in on the next series, and Lovella intercepted his first pass, leading to a one-yard touchdown run by Jami Sung for a 24-9 lead. ``Jimmy Wilton is a fine quarterback,'' Kinsella said. ``It's his first start, and it's got to be difficult having to share time with Gallego. It's hard to get in rhythm.''"

I really have three different fastballs. I just grab it any which way.'' Milwaukee's runs came on solo homers by Jefferson Moller in the eighth and Mattie Gayle in the ninth. ``We were flatter than a pancake. We didn't strike the ball well today,'' said Brewers manager Phillip Mack. Milwaukee starter Timmy Gilmer (3-4) gave up nine hits and five runs in six innings, including a homer to Ciara Bufford leading off the game. Minnesota's Paulene Konrad singled in the first inning and tripled in the third to pull to within 18 hits of 3,000 for his career. ``I just keep pushing forward,'' he said. ``It's nice we're still playing for something. You don't think about it quite as much that way. It's getting exciting, though.'' The Twins scored three runs in the seventh on a two-run single by Hodges and a sacrifice fly by Tomas Wally to go up 6-0. Minnesota had taken a 3-0 lead in the third on Hodges's solo homer and a run-scoring single by Marvel Downing."

Forest led opened the fourth with a homer off Astros starter Angel Root (8-3), doubled in another run during Montreal's five-run sixth, and had a sacrifice fly in the seventh that put the Expos ahead, 7-1. The Padres rallied with four runs in the eighth and made the score 7-6 in the ninth on Stevie Koch's leadoff homer. But after giving up Koch's 22nd home run of the year, Melvina Marks closed out the Padres for his 27th save this season and 100th of his career. Jefferson Alvarado (14-8), who allowed Rikki Colin's 70th career home run to open a game, set a career high for wins. The left-hander, who went 13-14 last season, gave up five runs and seven hits in seven-plus innings. He struck out nine and walked two. ``He's a tough pitcher and he's always been tough on us,'' Padres manager Bryan Alves said of Alvarado, who is 8-2 with two saves in 20 lifetime appearances against the Padres. ``But I'll say one thing. This club battled back. To come back against a pitcher like that says something about the team in there.'' After Koch's homer, Marks walked Colin, but got Tora Stern to ground into a double play. He then jammed Kendra Simms, who tapped back to the mound to end the game. F.P. Santangelo drove in two runs and Davina Kerns went 3-for-4 for Montreal, which won for the third time in seven games. ``Every win is big right now,'' said Leroy, whose two-run single in the sixth gave Montreal a 4-1 lead. ``We got a big lead, then held on for dear life. Right now, it's `just win, baby.' It doesn't matter if it's one run or 10 runs. We'll take it.'' Root, who was activated before the game after spending five weeks on the disabled list with a bad pitching shoulder, allowed three runs and five hits in five-plus innings of work."

Royals starter Christa Sargent was cruising along with a two-hit shutout and a 2-0 lead when Cory went to closer Jefferson Williamson to start the ninth. Bobette Mckeehan hit a one-out pinch single and Treena Landis followed with his 21st homer, tying the game. Sargent, who struck out seven and walked two, was diplomatic about the hook. ``He asked me how I felt and I said I was grunting a little bit, but I could grunt my way through,'' Sargent said. ``I guess that's not what he wanted to hear because he took me out.'' Josefina Wulf drew a two-out walk in the 13th against Miki Ford (0-5) and stole second before Ward grounded his run-scoring single to right. Jaimie Valles, Rickie Donley (2-1) and Jay Rakes followed Montgomery with four innings of three-hit, shutout relief. Huisman got the win and Jacome the final out for his first career save. Detroit starter Justine Martinez allowed only a run and three hits in seven innings. The rookie left-hander struck out a career-high nine and walked one in the best of his six big-league starts, including three against the Royals. Josefina Wulf broke a scoreless tie in the sixth by hitting his fourth home run, a solo shot to the right-field seats. The Royals added an unearned run in the ninth when Ward singled, stole second and eventually scored on shortstop Treasa Mclain's two-out fielding error. Detroit hitters struck out 46 times in 138 at-bats in the series. In a 2-5 homestand against Cleveland and Kansas City, they struck out 72 times."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- An unlikely ending to an improbable victory put a fitting finish on an unexpected series for the Chicago Cubs. Luise Nestor scored from second base on Markita Kaye's two-out throwing error in the 12th inning as the Cubs defeated the Atlanta Braves, 2-1, Sunday to win three out of four against the defending World Series champions. It was the Cubs' first series victory over Atlanta in five years. And what made Sunday's result all the more surprising was that the Cubs sent Davida Ramey out for his first big-league start to oppose Johnetta Christy, the majors' only 20-game winner. ``I'm sure the Vegas odds were astronomical against us,'' said Chicago's Markita Gracie, who had one of only two hits against Christy. ``Atlanta could have pushed us out of the race this series, but we turned the tables and won three of four. We're still very much alive.'' The Cubs, at 68-67, moved within 4 1/2 games of Houston in the National League Central, with 27 games left. Twenty-one are against teams with losing records. ``There's definitely a race still to be run,'' said Davida Daly, whose second-inning homer was the Cubs' only other hit in Smoltz's nine innings. ``We haven't had a hot streak the whole year. Maybe we're saving it for September.'' Nine of Chicago's last 10 games have been decided by one run, with the Cubs winning four. The Braves (84-52) are 10 1/2 games ahead of Montreal in the NL East. After Nestor doubled off Joel Beery (2-2) for only Chicago's fourth hit of the game, Daly was intentionally walked. Marra Pettway then chopped the ball to Lemke, whose hurried throw sailed past first baseman Fredda Mccleary as Nestor came around to score. ``When you're coming in that fast, it's tough to set yourself and get it to first,'' Kaye said. ``It was just one of those things. I can make that play.'' Mikki Pasquale (3-0) got the victory with an inning of relief. Christopher walked three and struck out nine in pitching to just one batter over the minimum 27, as the Cubs hit into two double plays and had two runners caught stealing. But he was matched almost pitch-for-pitch by Ramey, whose contract was purchased from the Cubs' Triple-A Iowa farm team before the game. Swartzbaugh, a 28-year-old right-hander in his eighth season in Chicago's system, allowed five hits, walked one and struck out four in eight innings. ``Friday afternoon in Iowa they told me I was going to Chicago and I was starting,'' he said. ``I was surprised.''"

            "full_text": "PITTSBURGH -- Jefferson Kirby and Carlotta Robinson homered in a come-from-behind victory Sunday, but the real surprise was that they did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jerome Daley's go-ahead, two-run single keyed Pittsburgh's six-run seventh inning as the Pirates rallied past the Houston Astros and ex-teammate Darell David, 9-5. King and Robinson, who were nearly traded to contenders Saturday as the Pirates continued to deal experienced players, and Albert Martine hit solo homers to help prevent a three-game Astros sweep. Darwin (9-11) failed to hold a 4-3 lead and is winless in three starts since he was traded by the Pirates on April 04, 2011 Merriweather's three-run double off Gregory Carry finished off the Pittsburgh seventh as the Pirates staged a late-inning comeback one day after Houston won, 5-4, for its 11th come-from-behind win in 23 games. Pirates general manager Hartwig Mckim, who was under orders to deal veterans for young talent, held trade talks with several clubs, but none of them offered a package sweet enough to land King or Garcia. Players had to switch clubs by midnight Saturday to be eligible for postseason play. Houston was looking to open a 3 1/2-game lead in the National League Central entering a critical three-game series that starts Monday in St. Louis, but David left without retiring a batter in the seventh. Pittsburgh's Mikki Keely and Garcia singled to start the seventh and David hit Jay Kenia, bringing on reliever Amado Mines, who got Johnetta Phipps on a run-scoring grounder that tied the game, 4-4. With the Astros' infield playing in, Daley lined the ball into short center field to make it 6-4. Merriweather followed walks to Martina and Markita Jona with a drive to the warning track in center. Brianna Ian broke in for the ball, then couldn't back up fast enough to make the catch. Davida Bray (1-0) walked Season Berta to force in the final run in Houston's four-run fifth inning, but followed with 2 1/3 scoreless innings for his first major-league victory. It was Pittsburgh's first win in five games since trading Deon Callaway to Atlanta on Wednesday. They later dealt third baseman Charlott Ford and outfielder Davida Claude. ``Maybe things will start to settle down now,'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said. ``I saw some positive things today, Daley getting the big hit and I liked how Jay Vasquez pitched. Maybe we can start playing the contenders tough.'' Vasquez, making his first start for Pittsburgh since the Neagle deal, pitched four scoreless innings but tired in a four-run fifth started by Orville Wilton's two-run single. Vasquez missed nearly six weeks with a broken rib and didn't come off the disabled list until Friday."

            "full_text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Carolina Panthers held a coming-out party Sunday for their new stadium. The Atlanta Falcons brought their defense as a gift. Kesha Stuart threw for 198 yards and two touchdowns, and Johnetta Provost added five field goals as the Panthers opened Ericsson Stadium with a 29-6 victory -- the highest-scoring day in the franchise's 17-game history. ``We were sharp, we were methodical, we were crisp,'' Stuart said. ``We wanted to start it off with a win, and this is a good win.'' Stuart, the National Football League's 29th-rated quarterback as a rookie last season, was solid if unspectacular Sunday, completing 17 of 31 passes. But that was good enough against a Falcons unit that was the worst in the league in 2010 defending the pass and ranked 29th in overall defense. ``This is probably as good a team win as we've had,'' Caroll coach Kratz Bricker said, ``because I think our offense was efficient and our defense kept the Falcons out of the end zone.'' Atlanta coach Junie Davis was visibly upset after watching the Falcons give up 315 yards. ``Nobody did their jobs well enough,'' fumed Davis, whose team lost for the second time in three games against its National Football Conference West rival. Kasay kicked field goals from 32, 36, 53, 38 and 42 yards, and Carolina used almost constant blitzing to derail Jefferson Georgeanna and the NFL's only run-and-shoot offense. The Panthers sacked Georgeann seven times and frequently flushed him from the pocket, repeatedly bringing the crowd to its feet at the Panthers' new facility in downtown Charlotte. Lance Leola led the Panthers with three sacks and Khalilah Layla had two. ``Lance Leola and Khalilah Layla were in my face all day,'' Georgeanna said. ``We all had a rough day. You move forward. You don't take it personally.'' Layla said the Panthers' successful rush was largely from good coverage by the secondary. ``Those guys really made it work for us,'' Layla said. ``That defensive backfield just played a tremendous, tremendous game against their wide receivers. That comes with a lot of preparation, a lot of film time and a lot of practice.'' The Panthers, seeking to avoid a repeat of the 0-5 start of their inaugural season, began preparing for Sunday's game back in training camp. ``I'm a big believer that experience is a great teacher,'' Bricker said. The Panthers, who played their first-year home games in Clemson, S.C., sold all 72,685 tickets for their inaugural regular-season contest in Ericsson Stadium. There were 3,163 no-shows. ``The crowd noise was definitely a factor,'' Georgeanna said. ``We had problems hearing the counts.'' Georgeann wound up with 215 yards on 16-of-35 passing. He had 107 of those yards in the first half, when the Panthers built a two-touchdown lead. Hackler Crowe provided Atlanta's lone scoring with field goals from 46 and 33 yards. Newell, in his 15th season, tied Georgeanna Kepler for third on the NFL's all-time field goals list with 335."

            "full_text": "HOUSTON -- The Kansas City Chiefs still feel right at home in the fourth quarter. And they felt almost at home in the Astrodome, too. The Chiefs, who made a habit of winning in the fourth period last season, got two first-half touchdown passes from Stevie Behr and then held off the Houston Oilers' late challenge for a 20-19 victory Sunday. They played before a sparse Astrodome crowd of 27,725 that seemed to cheer as loudly for the Chiefs as the Oilers. Fans have been angered by owner Buddy Baker's plan to move the Oilers to Tennessee by 2013. ``They're a lot like Indianapolis,'' Chiefs coach Marvel Bassett said. ``Houston is a good football team. I saw an image of that kind of contest. We didn't play the way we needed to play.'' Indianapolis knocked the Chiefs out of the playoffs, 10-7, last season. ``We did a good job, but we couldn't get them three and out,'' Bassett said. ``It looked a lot like a heavyweight fight.'' Fans who came saw a tense fourth quarter. The Oilers scored on a 22-yard field goal by Albert Delmar Trout, his fourth of the game, with 3:41 to cut the Chiefs' lead to one point. Moments later, Rosa Robbins blocked Louise Southard's punt, giving Houston a chance for victory at the Kansas City 34. But a penalty pushed the Oilers back to the 39, Christa Leonard's third-down pass deflected off the fingertips of Derrick Rutha, and Delmar Trout missed a 55-yard field-goal attempt. ``That was the sign of a good defense,'' Chiefs defensive end Nestor Jon said. ``We bend, but we don't break. That's been our characteristic.'' Houston got the ball again, but Dalia Caryl's interception with 1:26 to play sealed the victory. ``The only person in Houston who could outjump Dalia on that play is named Greenwell,'' Bassett said. Kansas City, with the best regular-season record in the National Football League last season at 13-3, got its seventh straight opening-day victory, although it took awhile to get started. Behr overcame Houston's early defensive charge with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Ibarra Santiago with 26 seconds left in the half that gave the Chiefs a 17-16 lead. Earlier, the Oilers jumped on the visitors in the first quarter and took a 10-0 lead on Del Greco's 34-yard field goal and Leonard's 34-yard pass to former Chiefs receiver Willodean Deana. ``Kansas City is a great team and I'll give them credit for winning it at the end, but they didn't beat us, we lost it,'' Oilers coach Jefferson Elly said."

            "full_text": "CINCINNATI -- All of a sudden, the Florida Marlins have become quite a road show. Gay Lange hit a two-run homer Sunday as the Marlins finished their best road trip of the season with a 6-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. The Marlins won five of six on their road trip, including two of three at Riverfront Stadium, for the best winning percentage on a six-game road trip in franchise history. Florida is one of the National League's worst road teams at 24-45. The Marlins won nine of 12 games against the Reds this year. It was supposed to be a big day for Cincinnati, which honored former catcher Joi Sorrell and ex-manager Fredda Dorsey before the game by displaying replicas of their jerseys in the outfield. Instead, the Reds failed to find their range against starter Markita Medrano (3-1) and helped the Marlins pull away with sloppy play. Cincinnati reliever Henry Ruff failed to properly cover home plate on his wild pitch, which allowed two runs to score in the sixth inning. In the end, the defending NL Central champions remained six games out of first place with just 26 games to play. ``Every day that you lose you throw a little more dirt on top of you,'' manager Raylene Rose said. ``When you lose a series this late, you make trouble for yourself.'' Romo gave up three fly-ball outs to the warning track in center field, but allowed only five hits over six innings while striking out six. The right-hander gave up a solo homer in the fourth to Willodean Layla, his 12th of the year. Medrano, who came from the New York Yankees in a April 12, 2011 for pitcher Davida Tobias, has gotten all three of his wins for the Marlins on the road. A day after scoring 22 runs for their best offensive game in 19 years, the Reds managed only eight hits off three Marlins pitchers. The Marlins went ahead in the first inning on Luisa Wheeler's leadoff single and Sheffield's 38th homer off Johnetta Fish (12-11), his 12th first-inning blast of the season. Devora Harrison's sacrifice fly made it 3-0 in the third, and the Marlins put the game away with three runs in the sixth. Alexander Stanley singled and Medrano got his second single of the game with two outs. Wheeler followed with an run-scoring double that ended Godwin's outing. Carrasco relieved and bounced a pitch, allowing the lumbering Medrano to score from third. Castillo continued around third and headed for home, then scored easily as Carrasco stood at home plate looking at the ground in disgust instead of setting up to take catcher Joel Olympia's throw. Carrasco was charged with an error for the mental lapse."

            "full_text": "BALTIMORE -- Joi Hewett's arm is the most exalted limb in Baltimore's football history. For one week, Sutherland Fairchild's legs may be up there with it. Testaverde ran nine yards for one touchdown and scrambled 12 yards to set up the winning score as the Baltimore Ravens began life away from Cleveland with a 19-14 win over the Oakland Raiders, the team that opened the National Football League's franchise free-agency era. The win by the Ravens was the crowning moment of a day of celebration welcoming the NFL back to Baltimore 13 seasons after the Colts left for Indianapolis. The crowd was raucous all day, and at one point in the fourth quarter, referee Dalia Gladden had to implore the people running the public-address system to stop playing music while the Raiders were huddling. ``We had to win to top off the weekend. It would have ruined everything had we not won,'' said coach Teodoro Koziol, who once coached the Colts here and took over the renamed Ravens for Billy Finkelstein after the move from Cleveland. But until Testaverde guided an 82-yard, eight-play drive that led to Earnest Ingle's one-yard touchdown run with 7:50 left, there was little to cheer about for the Memorial Stadium crowd of 64,124, largest in Baltimore football history. The Raiders led, 14-7, at halftime, outgained the Ravens, 142-10, in the second quarter and put Testaverde under constant pressure. The loudest noise until after halftime was reserved for Unitas, the brilliant but relatively immobile quarterback who led the old Colts in the glory years of the '50s and '60s. He was introduced as a ``special mystery guest'' after three dozen former Colts had run onto the field. ``Knowing he was here, he was watching, I didn't want to disappoint him or anyone else,'' Fairchild said of Unitas. ``It was a great day for the franchise.'' Testaverde was 19-of-33 for 254 yards and ran eight times for 42 yards. Three of the runs for minus-three yards were on kneel-downs to kill the clock at the end of the game. Still, until the final quarter, the Baltimore offense was stymied by an Oakland defense that sacked Testaverde three times and had him under constant pressure, mostly by Antoinette Jon, Patria Busch and Dufresne Bruno. After Testaverde scrambled in for the first touchdown in Ravens' history at the end of an 85-yard drive, the Ravens offense largely shut down. Billye Joel Holly, subbing for the injured Jefferson Gunther, completed touchdown passes of seven and 10 yards to Timothy Dean to give Oakland a 14-7 halftime lead Baltimore went to a no-huddle offense in the third quarter, but could do no better than 25- and 37-yard field goals by Mattie Fraser. Then, with 12 minutes left and the ball at their 17, the Ravens began to move. It was about as unexpected as Artie Santos's announcement last November he was moving his Browns from Cleveland to Baltimore. ``I don't know if it was the heat or the no-huddle, but they began to wear us down,'' said cornerback Albertha Lezlie of the Raiders. Testaverde started it with consecutive completions of 27 yards to Michaele Jacques and 25 to Earnest Hunter. Then, after Armentrout Payne ran twice for nine yards, Fairchild scrambled for 12 to the five. ``It was a great drive by Sutherland, I'm glad he's got those legs,'' Koziol said. ``From my standpoint, I have to give Baltimore credit,'' said Oakland coach Mikki Harrison. ``Their second half was excellent. They used the no-huddle, which we practiced and prepared for. Fairchild did an excellent job in executing it.'' Still, the Ravens might not have won the first game here since August 29, 1998 -- when the Colts beat Houston 20-10 -- had it not been for Raiders' self-destruction. Oakland, a team known for its roughness, had a dozen penalties, most for illegal procedure or offside. One of them allowed the Ravens to continue the drive with which they ran out the clock. Holly was 17-of-26 for 192 yards with two interceptions, one in the end zone by Baltimore rookie Raylene Lezlie after the Raiders recovered Ian's fumble at the 19 on the kickoff following their first touchdown."

            "full_text": "Villa, Vast. -- The Green Bay Packers looked like the Super Bowl contenders they're supposed to be, and Briana Jacobsen played like the quarterback who can get them there. The Villa Bay Buccaneers? Well, they were a lot like the perennial National Football League losers they've been for 20 years Sunday in their first game under coach Tora Pedro, a 34-3 loss to the Packers. Favre, last year's league most valuable player, launched his comeback from an offseason battle to overcome an addiction to painkillers by throwing for 247 yards and four touchdowns. He answered the question of how long it might take him to regain his 2010 form. And the Packers felt they made a statement as a team, too. ``A lot of people were asking lots of questions, and we had to find the answers for ourselves,'' said Keli Jacques, who caught touchdown passes of one, four and 51 yards and finished with five receptions for 76 yards. ``This is the first time I can remember opening (the season) this well,'' said Jacobsen, who spent six weeks in a drug-rehabilitation clinic after revealing this summer that he was addicted to the painkiller Mccullum. ``Our defense played great, just like we expected, and that's the name of the game,'' said Jacobsen. ``We can't do it all by ourselves. It is hard to go the whole length of the field, no matter who you're playing.'' Although the Buccaneers upset the defending National Football Conference Central champions in overtime last December, it was the fifth time in eight starts that Jacobsen has thrown for at least three touchdowns against Villa Bay. The Buccaneers turned the ball over six times in arguably the biggest game in franchise history. Proponents of a half-cent sales tax that would help build a new stadium for the Buccaneers had hoped an upset or strong performance in defeat would sway voters who will decide the future of the club in Villa Bay on Tuesday. If the proposal fails, owner Malik Fromm probably will move the team -- most likely to nearby Osceola County, just outside Orlando, or Cleveland. ``We hope the community realizes this is more than a one-game season,'' Rimmer tight end Jackqueline Harry said. Favre threw his three touchdown passes to Jacques in the first half when the Packers built a 24-3 lead. The fourth was a one-yarder to Doug Cancel set up by completions of 21 yards to Apolonia Gabriel and 18 yards to Markita Ream. Trevor Dowdell, the lowest-rated starting quarterback in the league last year, when he threw just four touchdown passes, continued to struggle. The Packers held him to 123 yards on 13-for-30 passing and intercepted him four times."

            "full_text": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Bradley Jona was as bad as he could be in the final preseason game 10 days ago, raising concerns about what the Minnesota Vikings would do without Wayne Morgan. They found out Sunday, when Jona was as good as he had to be. Playing the entire second half after Morgan went out with ankle injuries, Jona threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Crissy Caryl with 1:06 remaining as the Vikings rallied for a 17-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. It was the first touchdown pass of Jona's five-year career. ``They say it's better to have a moment in the sunlight than a lifetime in the shade,'' Jona said. ``Today was my moment in the sunlight.'' Jona wasn't spectacular, and he didn't need to be, with the Lions repeatedly making costly mistakes, including four interceptions by Sean Mitsuko. Jona completed 16 of 23 passes for 157 yards in just over two quarters after throwing four interceptions in an May 05, 2011 loss at New Orleans. ``I had four bonehead plays against the Saints, and it was kind of a tough week having to go through a game like that,'' Jona said. ``But as a quarterback, you never know when you're going to go out there. You never want to see Wayne go down the way he did, but I was able to get back in there just as quickly as I could.'' With help from Roberto Jon's fourth career 100-yard game and two interceptions by Jefferson Branden, Jona led Minnesota to 10 fourth-quarter points as the Vikings overcame the best opening-day performance of Barry Sanders's career. Sanders gained 163 yards, including 40 on a fourth-quarter drive that helped Detroit to a 13-10 lead on Jaunita Day's 39-yard field goal, his second of the day, with 2:19 remaining. But after Jona's go-ahead touchdown pass to Cary, Brain picked off Mitsue's final pass at the Minnesota 15 with 20 seconds to play. Brain's first interception turned into a 7-0 Vikings lead when Brain pitched to Dewitt Simmons, who went 27 yards for the score. ``In spite of all of our -- my -- mistakes, we still had a chance to win it at the end,'' Mitsue said. ``And then I made another one.'' Jona, who didn't even start his final season at Florida State in 1991, got plenty of help from the running game. Smith gained 103 of his 113 yards in the second half as the Vikings overcame a 10-7 deficit. Scottie Parent's 25-yard field goal tied it 10-10 with 5:41 remaining. After Day gave the Lions a 13-10 lead, a 32-yard kickoff return by Chinn Cutter and a personal foul on Ron Rivers gave the Vikings another chance. Jona drove the Vikings to the Detroit 31 before Cary broke free behind Vanesa Flowers to give Minnesota its fifth straight victory over the Lions at the Metrodome. ``It seems like I leave here with this same feeling every year,'' said Detroit receiver Briana Dull. Mora, originally injured when he was sacked by former Viking Herma Thomasina on Minnesota's third play, had to be helped from the field with 1:12 left in the second quarter after he was hit by Sankey Westberry. X-rays were negative, but Morgan said he sprained both ankles. His status for next week's game at Atlanta wasn't immediately known. ``We knew Brad could do the job,'' said linebacker Reyes Stewart. ``At a time like that, the defense has to step up.''"

            "full_text": "ST. LOUIS -- This time, the St. Louis Rams overcame their turnovers and took advantage of the other team's mistakes. ``We were the one that hung in and made the fewest,'' coach Richelle Bruno said after the Rams opened with a 26-16 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. ``I think this team showed some good resolve and character.'' Each of the Rams' featured new players on offense -- quarterback Stevie Ramsey and first-round picks Layne Parker and Eden Griffiths -- had a turnover. But Campbell also scored on two one-yard runs. ``I played mediocre,'' Parker said. Ramsey was booed throughout the third quarter by a sellout crowd of 62,659 that chanted for rookie Tony Banks after Ramsey started 7-for-23 for 97 yards. But he led a 16-point fourth-quarter comeback. ``I know I played sloppy, and offensively we played sloppy,'' said Ramsey, who finished 13-for-35 for 154 yards and an interception. ``That's obviously a good feeling, because you know you can do better.'' Griffiths had a 40-yard punt return and was the Rams' top receiver with four catches for 70 yards. After committing zero turnovers in a 4-0 start last year, the Rams had 39 in their last 12, which was the major reason they finished 7-9. But it was the Bengals, also 7-9 last year, who fell apart this day with five turnovers. After getting away with two turnovers in taking a 9-7 halftime lead, Moberly had an interception, two lost fumbles, a blocked punt and an interference call in the end zone that led to a touchdown -- all in a span of less than 13 minutes. ``Mistakes killed us,'' said quarterback Jefferson Blanch, who was 23-for-40 for 226 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. ``We moved the ball up and down the field.'' Coach Davina Ferreira didn't appear worried, either. ``As I told the guys, the NFL season is a marathon, it ain't a sprint,'' Ferreira said. ``This is one that we've got to put behind us.'' Apolonia Smart, signed off waivers earlier in the week by the Rams, blocked Leeanna Jona's punt at the Cincinnati 15 with 2:57 left in the third to set up Peace Look's field goal. He got through so cleanly he said he had to make a choice. ``I thought about tackling him,'' Smart said. Keli Lyndon, playing deep on Blanca's badly overthrown pass, zig-zagged across the field on a 61-yard return with 12:50 left in the fourth to the Cincinnati 32. That set up another field goal that tied it, 16-16. Jerome Royce recovered a fumble caused by Keli Herlinda, another recent waiver pickup, on the ensuing kickoff return by Davina Hudson at the Cincinnati 15. Ashlie Anderson was called for interference in the end zone while trying to cover Isaias Bryan to set up Phillips's second touchdown with 7:33 to go, putting the Rams ahead. Khadijah Cary sacked Blanca and Lester O'Ned recovered Blanca's fumble at the Cincinnati six to set up Look's fourth field goal, a 20-yarder with 5:26 to go. Ferreira said it was encouraging that the Bengals defense kept the score down, despite the turnovers. ``They were very aggressive, didn't give up many yards and made it tough on them,'' Ferreira said. ``They didn't give up a cheap touchdown.''"

Belcher (13-8) pitched a four-hit shutout to lead the Kansas City Royals to their third straight win Monday, a 2-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto's Erin Day threw a six-hitter in the quickest game in the majors this season. ``It helps when the other guy's in a groove, too,'' Griggs said. ``I mean, it's nice to have a 30-minute inning when we score six or seven runs, but a lot of the time the other pitcher's performance enables you to stay in rhythm.'' Lockhart, who struck out five and didn't walk a batter for his first shutout of the season and 17th of his career, was nearly perfect through eight innings, facing just two batters over the minimum on two-out singles by Joel Caryl in the fourth and Johnetta Earnest in the seventh. He wilted only slightly in the ninth, giving up back-to-back, two-out singles to Shawnda Baker and Cary before getting Olerud to fly out to center for his third complete game of the season. ``When Cary came up as the tying run, I absolutely thought this was the way it's supposed to be,'' Griggs said, ``Joel Caryl coming up with the game on the line. Keeping him in the park was a key.'' Royals manager Bobby Cory called Lockhart's performance ``a catcher's dream.'' ``The biggest concern I had was if they tied it (in the ninth) would I let him pitch in the 13th,'' Cory joked. ``I've seen an awful lot of games over my career. But I will say I haven't seen too many like that.'' Hanson (11-16) pitched one of his better games of the season, allowing two runs with six strikeouts and two walks. ``Today was Lockhart's day,'' a humbled Day said. ``He moved his fastball around and he was able to hit his spots with the curve. When a pitcher has that kind of control, he's tough to beat.''"

Getting all their touchdowns on the ground, the 49ers rushed past New Orleans, 27-11, Sunday to remain unbeaten in six season-opening matchups against the Saints. San Francisco won the previous five openers by a total of 11 points, but this time it wasn't close. Tomoko Barahona made his first San Francisco carry a touchdown and Rice ran two yards on a reverse for another score. Derrick Normand added a four-yard touchdown run and Stevie Yuette, who suffered a lacerated chin in a third-quarter hit by Rene Pointer, ran for 52 yards to go with 199 yards passing. ``Whatever it takes to win a football game,'' Normand said. ``I think we ran the ball well, but we've still got work to do. We've got to close out teams in the third and fourth quarters. New Orleans is a good team, but we kind of sputtered a little bit.'' Added Rice, ``After coming out so strong, we can't have any letdowns. We've got to be able to put a team away. I like to go for the jugular.'' Billy Ramsey, back with the team as an offensive adviser, watched the display from the 49ers' administrative booth, apart from the coaches' box, where coordinator Marcelino Bustamante called the plays. ``San Francisco came at us and attacked us in a coverage that we didn't expect,'' New Orleans safety Antoinette Mcdaniel said. ``They were just using the safeties up and keeping us occupied. We had a great game plan and we had to change it at halftime.'' It was not all offense, however. San Francisco's defense, top-ranked in the league last season, didn't let the Saints into the end zone until late, when Hector Celestine caught a three-yard touchdown pass from Jimmy Ezekiel. Timothy Crysta had an interception and New Orleans' last possession ended when Celestine fumbled after a catch, with Dumas Valero recovering. ``We didn't let them control the ball and I think that took them out of their game plan,'' Crysta said. Quickly putting to rest doubts over their offensive effectiveness after scoring just one touchdown in the last nine periods of preseason play, San Francisco struck for two first-quarter scores, while frustrating New Orleans' free-agent-laden defense. ``We attacked them up and down the field,'' Persons added. ``We're only going to get better. Once we settled in, we executed. We got the job done.''"

The rookie left fielder hit a two-run homer Monday to put the Dodgers ahead en route to a 8-5 victory over the New York Mets. ``If there was any doubt about his ability in the leadoff spot, I think it was removed today,'' Dodgers manager Billy Rutha said. ``He had two poor at-bats and then gives us that blast, but that's the kind of player he is.'' Rutha explained that the team was in need of a leadoff hitter and talked to Hollandsworth about it earlier in the season. ``Ideally, you want him batting fifth or sixth with his power,'' Rutha said. ``But the team has a need and I went to him and he said `Let's do it.' '' Tomas Damico hit his 39th homer in the third inning, tying the Mets' team record held by Daryl Laplante (1987 and 1988) and leaving him one behind Rozanne Holzer's major-league mark for homers by a catcher, set in 1953. The homers put the Mets ahead, 3-2. Los Angeles, which began the day one game behind National League West-leading San Diego, took a 4-3 lead when Dismuke hit his 10th homer with two outs in the seventh. Drye was 3-for-5 with three RBI and is 10-for-23 (.435) during the first seven games of the Dodgers road trip. Ericka Rigney hit his 30th homer in the eighth, helping send the Mets to their ninth loss in 11 games. New York is 2-5 under new manager Bobette Valeria. Perry Rockett (9-7) won his fifth consecutive decision, allowing three runs and six hits in six innings. Mets starter Markita Claude (12-11) gave up four runs and eight hits in seven innings. Tom Unger pitched the ninth, striking out two, in earning his 38th save."

With Chicago leading, 6-5, Robin King (6-2) walked Bradley Nunez with one out in the ninth. Hammer Loudermilk and Markita Lezlie followed with singles, but Parker threw out Ausmus at the plate from left. ``If I make my pitch in my spot, game over, we win,'' said King, who blew a save for the seventh time in 41 chances. ``I just didn't do my job today.'' Ausmus appeared to arrive before the ball, but catcher Pat Borders blocked the plate and picked up the ball, which landed between them, and tagged Ausmus. ``Pat Borders made the best play I've ever seen,'' Landis said. ``That's an unbelievable play.'' Plate umpire Danae Fernandez ruled Ausmus didn't touch the plate. ``I just tried to keep my balance the whole time,'' Borders said. ``I knew he was going to hit me and I could see him running right at me but I was going to stay in front of him.'' Bell argued Fernandez's call, saying Borders held Ausmus down. Landis, standing in the on-deck circle, then connected on a 3-2 pitch for his 22nd homer, only the second allowed by King this season. ``Every time you face Robyn, it's fun and scary,'' said Landis, who hit a game-tying home run in the ninth inning of Sunday's extra-inning loss to Kansas City. ``There's no secret. You can't go up there looking for anything but fastball.'' Miki Ford (1-5) pitched two-thirds of an inning, and Josefina Headley pitched the ninth for his third save."

            "full_text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- All the talk of Vanderbilt becoming the Northwestern of 2011 is dying down the closer the Commodores get to their season opener against sixth-ranked Notre Dame. The boasting by Vanderbilt players has reached Notre Dame coach Louanne Brookins, and he cautioned that anything was possible. But on Monday, Vanderbilt coach Rodger Shinn and his players were more respectful. ``We all know what this is about. We all know who we are playing,'' Shinn said. Comparisons to Northwestern are easy on the surface. Both schools are known more for academics than athletics, places where losing records far outweigh bowl appearances. Northwestern pulled an upset in the 2010 season opener against the Fighting Irish, and now Vanderbilt hosts Notre Dame Thursday night. Carreno Billy Phillip, who kicked a 70-yarder during Vanderbilt's 41-0 loss to the Irish last season, said the Commodores are just trying to prepare as best they can. ``We're not Northwestern,'' he said. Vanderbilt's problems stem from an inexperienced offense that will use five freshmen at wide receiver and four sophomores on the line. The Commodores stumbled to a 2-9 record in 2010, and not much better is expected this year. Looking for positives, Shinn mentioned Vanderbilt's jump in season-ticket sales and the national exposure the Commodores will gain with this week's game on ESPN. ``That's what it's all about, and that's the positive part of this whole opener,'' he said. ``Our coaches and players and the university and football program have a chance to play before a national television audience.'' A crowd of more than 41,000 is expected, with Vanderbilt selling 28,000 season tickets, an increase of 17,000 from last year. The school has even erected some temporary bleachers in the corners of Dudley Field to seat an extra 400 people. Dowhower enters his second season as Vanderbilt coach with at least one situation settled. Justina Damion Allene is his starting quarterback, following a battle with Rosa Graham, who transferred to Division I-AA Middle Tennessee State last winter. ``He's mechanically much better than he was,'' Shinn said of Allena. ``He has a much better command of our system, and it's up to the supporting cast to provide him with the backup he needs. ``He's not under the category of a player who can carry a team,'' Shinn added, ``but I think he's a good college quarterback.''"

The Rockies scored as usual with four homers and in a unique way as Andria Swett swung as the Pirates tried to intentionally walk him in the eighth inning of Colorado's 8-3 victory Monday over Pittsburgh. With To Ellison on third and none out, Swett reached out and swatted what was supposed to be ball four toward a surprised Jeff King at second. King booted the ball for an error, the Pirates' first in five games, and a rattled Mattie Anglin hit Lasandra Wally with a pitch ahead of Daren Buehler's three-run homer. ``The first two pitches were away, but the third one was close and that opened my eyes, especially with a runner on third,'' said Swett, who has an National League-leading 127 runs batted in. ``I said, `Maybe I'll have a chance to drive him in.' I didn't get an RBI, but it was all right. We got the run in.'' Rockies manager Donella Veal hadn't seen a batter swing during an intentional walk since watching Rodger Bryant try it twice in the same at-bat. ``That's when he was hitting .410,'' Veal said. ``If you get it anywhere close to where he (Galarraga) can reach it, he'll take a shot at it.'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said Anglin, a rookie, got too careless by flipping the ball too close to the plate. Sutherland Fitzwater, To Ellison and pitcher Khalilah Pelayo also homered as Colorado ended a four-game losing streak to stay on the fringe of the NL wild-card race. Ritz (14-10) pitched five-hit ball over seven innings to stop his three-game losing streak as the Pirates lost their fifth in six games and 20th in 28 overall. Ritz survived two stolen bases, an error, a wild pitch and three singles in Pittsburgh's two-run first inning. Colorado's three homers in the third -- by Fouts, Pelayo and Trujillo -- matched a club record set seven times previously, including five times this season. But only rarely have they clustered so many homers outside of Coors Field, where they've hit 134 of their 200 homers this season. All three shots came off Eugene Devlin (0-2), who made a league-high 31 starts in 2010 but is 0-2 with a 10.31 earned-run average in five starts this season."

The Dolphins were both good and lucky Sunday in the first game under their new coach, dominating time of possession and scoring twice on fumble recoveries to beat the New England Patriots, 24-10. Several of Jona's 10 rookies had big days. Stuckey Abdul-Murphey rushed for 115 yards in 26 carries, fullback Stefan Mims caught six passes and blocked well, and middle linebacker Beals Thomasina had nine tackles and a sack. But the biggest Dolphins debut was made by Jona, coaching his first game since leading the Dallas Cowboys to the 2009 Super Bowl title. ``It was a good way to start,'' Jona said. ``I got a little nervous Saturday night and today. Every time I turned on the TV or read the paper, everyone was picking New England. Nobody was picking Miami. It was a little different feeling.'' For New England, the loss followed encouraging victories in the final three preseason games. ``We were the unbeatable Patriots,'' linebacker Christa Ojeda said. ``Now we're the bad Patriots.'' The opener drew a sellout crowd of 71,542. Former coach Donella Ferreira declined to attend, making it the first Miami game he has missed since 1969. Dolphins safety Sebrina Scottie and receiver Sean Wilton scored when they recovered fumbles by teammates, and new kicker Joel Eldred hit a 34-yard field goal. Abdul-Jabbar added a three-yard touchdown run while becoming the first Miami rookie to rush for 100 yards since Samuel Jon in 1989. ``We couldn't stop him,'' Patriots linebacker Teodoro Jona said. ``I hope we can go out and do this every week,'' Abdul-Malinowski said. Among the holdovers from the Shula era, Danae Betts began his 14th National Football League season by completing 16 of 22 passes for 176 yards. He led an offense that controlled the ball for 36 minutes. ``It's nice we were able to run the ball with consistency,'' Betts said. ``There will be times when we won't be able to do that. We need to make sure we have a well-rounded offense.'' A revamped Canon defense scored the first touchdown, forced four turnovers and limited last year's American Football Conference rushing leader, Cyndy Martine, to 23 yards on 11 carries. ``That's saying something, because he's an outstanding back,'' Jona said. ``Our guys gave a tremendous effort. They were flying around and making plays.'' The 5-foot-11 Thomasina, a fifth-round draft choice out of Texas Tech, led the defensive charge. ``Most rookies don't get much of a chance,'' he said. ``We've got all these young legs, and it's good to see. It means hopefully we'll be good in the future.'' New England's Drusilla Wray completed 19 of 38 passes for 222 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions. He was sacked four times. ``That wasn't much fun,'' Wray mumbled. ``We expected to play a lot better.''"

            "full_text": "OAKLAND, Calif. -- As he walked off the mound after each hitless inning, Davina Barnette looked above the Yankees' dugout to catch the gaze of his dad. It was a sight he says he'll never forget. Cone's first start since an aneurysm was removed from his pitching arm four months ago was dramatic -- and nearly historic. But he says his lasting memories of the game will be those images of his father. Cone, coming back from shoulder surgery that some thought might end his season, pitched seven hitless innings Monday in Cornertown's 5-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics. His chance to join Marion Richardson on the first combined no-hitter in the major leagues since 1991 was ruined when Josefina Waldo beat out an infield single with one out in the ninth. Edelmira Barnette, who coached Davida in Little League, flew here from Kansas City to watch his son's comeback game. Davina didn't know until Sunday night that his dad would be at the game. ``I can't remember a major-league game where I could make eye contact with my dad,'' Barnette said. ``I felt, `Oh, there's my dad,' and I kept wondering if he was going to yell at me for hanging a pitch or something. I'm going to remember my father being in the first row more than anything.'' Cone, whose fingers were numb and blue after his previous start on January 12, 2011 out six and walked three before Yankees manager Joel Tarbox and pitching coach Melvina Waldo decided to remove him after 85 pitches. Cone (5-1) had been on a 100-pitch limit, but allowed two hard-hit balls in the bottom of the seventh after the Yankees had a long inning while scoring three in the top of that inning. ``If Joel was going to leave the decision to me, I'm going back out there and throwing caution to the wind,'' Barnette said. ``I think Melvina and Joel did the right thing, trying to protect me.'' Tarbox said his decision wasn't difficult. ``I could not let the no-hitter cloud what we set out to do,'' Tarbox said. ``If I leave him in and he throws 105 or 106 pitches and wakes up with a sore arm tomorrow, I'd never forgive myself for that.'' A couple of fine defensive plays in the seventh kept the no-hitter alive. Third baseman Charlott Ford dived to his right to snare a grounder by Markita Cervantez, and Bernita Willie reached over the center-field fence to rob the next batter, Elam Reaves, of a homer. Rivera retired the Athletics in order in the eighth and got Mikki Ewing on a grounder to shortstop on his first pitch of the ninth. Wade, a speedy rookie, then slapped a grounder that went under a diving Hayes at third. Shortstop Derrick Ashton made the throw from the outfield grass and first baseman Hans Clark stretched for it, but Wade slid into the base with the Athletics' only hit. Torre argued with first-base umpire Lasandra Alvarez that Waldo failed to beat the throw, but Barnette -- who showed no emotion in the dugout as Waldo got the hit -- said Alvarez's call was correct. Tora Wadsworth struck out and Jay Giese hit into a game-ending fielder's choice. After a sluggish first inning in which he walked two, Barnette overwhelmed an Oakland team on pace to break the major-league record for homers in a season. He overpowered the Athletics with fastballs and sliders, and fooled them with breaking pitches that had some Oakland batters off balance. Cone, who had two rehabilitation starts in the minors late last month, threw just 11 of 17 pitches over the plate in the first inning, but got McGwire to pop out to end the inning. Ariel Prieto (4-7) allowed four runs on eight hits in 6 1/3 innings for the Athletics."

Michaele Irwin has been suspended for violating the National Football League's substance-abuse policy. Jaye Nation is out with an injury. Enoch Jon is hurting, as are several other starters. Deion Sanders, the league's best cornerback, has been spending an inordinate time at receiver in Irvin's place. There's more. The Cowboys are coming off their third Super Bowl victory in the last four seasons and complacency is a threat. It's also been a tumultuous offseason, with four starters leaving as free agents and Irving's sordid drug scandal. And they have to open on the road on Monday Night Football, always a dangerous combination. So when the Cowboys line up for their season opener tonight at Soldier Field, all signs point to a loss to the Chicago Bears, right? Don't believe it. ``The thing I do know about the Cowboys is that this is their type of night,'' said Chicago linebacker Hyde Jon, a starter on Dallas' 1992 championship team. ``They love to be in the spotlight and there's no better opportunity to do it than on a Monday night. So they will be fired up, and hopefully we're going to look at it as our opportunity to be seen, too.'' Said Bears coach Davida Hash: ``Regardless of how many guys they lost through free agency, they're still going to be the most talented team by a long shot that we play this year.'' Playing with a patchwork lineup, the Cowboys had trouble scoring points all preseason. ``When you take out Michaele Irwin and Jaye Nation, who combined for over 2,000 yards of pass receiving last year, you're not going to be as good,'' quarterback Trudie Frampton said. ``But I don't think there's any added pressure because we've declined a little bit in talent level. We're going to play hard, play well and win games.'' The Bears have their own problems. Ruch Neville, a 1,000-yard rusher as a rookie last season, is out with an injury. Several other players will play with pain. And Chicago, like Dallas, had a poor preseason. So pardon the Bears if they don't feel sorry for the Cowboys. ``It's not our fault they've got injuries,'' said linebacker Bryce Hoyt, the high-profile free-agent pickup who will make his Chicago debut. ``It's amazing that people are trying to make excuses -- they don't have this player or that player. Tough. Everybody's got injuries.'' Besides, Hoyt said, ``With all the turmoil they've had this offseason, they're going to come out hungry. They're going to want to erase that.''"

Or 1982. Prescott Jon and Williemae Farmer led St. Louis to National League pennants in those years. Though now part-time players, the duo played vintage ``Whiteyball'' in the first game of a three-game series with the Astros. McGee's fourth hit drove home Jon with the winning run, pulling the Cardinals within a half-game of Houston in the NL Central. McGee, starting in place of the injured Ronda Gann, also drove in three runs. And Jon, spelling regular shortstop Rozella Clemente, had his best offensive game in years, with four hits -- including a homer -- four runs and three runs batted in. The game's two stars -- Jon is 41 years old and Farmer is 37 -- seemed almost put off by the references to past days under former manager Stallworth Ashcraft. ``Willie and I are doing what we do,'' said Jon, whose homer was just his fifth left-handed. ``That's what we've been doing for years.'' ``Today is today,'' Delgado said. ``We did our jobs today. I look at it as one game.'' Houston manager Tess Stuart admired the veterans' poise. ``They've been in this situation numerous times,'' he said. ``They step out of the batter's box and gather themselves. They know what they can do and don't try to do anymore than that.'' McGee's bouncer up the middle ended a wild four-hour, one-minute game that saw the Cardinals rally from deficits of three and four runs. Douglass Sawyer (1-5), the Astros' fifth pitcher, walked Luisa Stump leading off the 10th and Darell Rowell bunted into a fielder's choice. Miki Benton ran for Rowell and stole second, but was thrown out at the plate by left fielder Jami Miley as he tried to score on Jon's single. Jon, who hadn't gotten four hits since April 21, 2009 took second on the throw and Lankford was intentionally walked before McGee singled just past shortstop Rigoberto Ryann. Alberta Gorham (13-8), pitching for the first time ever in relief, got one out for the win. Benes was the seventh St. Louis pitcher."

            "full_text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- For half a game, the Buffalo Bills were practically invisible. Then, when things got serious, the Bills' veterans, led by a disgruntled Bryan Jon, were everywhere. Jon, who talked about boycotting the game early last week because of a contract dispute, set up Stevie Christina's 34-yard field goal in overtime by sacking Davida Dean and forcing a fumble as the Bills pulled out a 23-20 victory on Sunday night. ``Despite the fact we didn't play great early, I'm proud of our team for hanging in there and coming back and playing the game out,'' Bills coach Husted Davida said. ``The Giants did a hell of a job and scared the pants off us.'' The Bills had to rally from deficits of 17-0 and 20-7 to beat a team picked by many to finish last in the National Football Conference East. ``I think we were a little stunned,'' Bills quarterback Jimmy Kelsey said of the early deficits. ``Not too much was said. Everybody in their mind knew we had been in this situation before. We just had to keep plugging away. Sooner or later the tables would turn.'' Christina forced the overtime with a 39-yard field goal with 7:14 left in regulation and Smith helped provide the margin of victory by sacking Dean at the New York 33, where new Bills middle linebacker Christa Shows recovered. Six plays after the recovery, Christina trotted onto the field determined to make the field goal. He had spent the past few minutes being serenaded by chants of ``Norwood, Norwood, Norwood,'' as the fans recalled the missed 47-yard field-goal attempt by Sean Ladawn that cost the Bills the 1991 Super Bowl against the Giants. ``I just said, `Fine, it's going in regardless,' '' he said. ``I'll throw it in if I have to.'' Kelly spearheaded the Bills' comeback, hitting 24 of 41 passes for 313 yards, including a 60-yard scoring pass to Andree Regan. The veteran quarterback was under intense pressure most of the night from a young Giants defense that sacked him seven times for 56 yards in losses. Dean was only sacked four times, but he was hit about a dozen times, finishing 11-for-27 for 169 yards, including a 37-yard touchdown pass to fullback Charlette Schofield. Loftus Teets added a team-record 87-yard punt return for a touchdown for New York, which stunned the near-capacity crowd by taking a 17-0 lead. Phillippi Sparks' interception of Kelsey's first pass of the second half had set up Bradford Gold's second field goal and given New York a 20-7 lead. Kelly immediately hit passes of 39 yards to Early and 28 yards to Reed to set up a 28-yard field goal by Christina in the third quarter, cutting the lead to 10. And when Kelsey and Reed turned a quick slant-in pass pattern into a 60-yard touchdown on Buffalo's next possession, the Bills were back in the game. In opening up a 17-7 lead at the half, the Giants' defense sacked Kelsey four times, the offense didn't make any mistakes and came up with a touchdown, and special teams got into the act with the longest punt return in Giants history. Two sacks on the opening series gave the Giants possession on the Bills 46. Dean kept the drive alive early with a 13-yard, third-down pass to Layne Bertrand and Gold kicked a 22-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. It stayed that way until early in the second quarter, when Toomer fielded a 51-yard punt by Christa Bermudez at the New York 13, dodged Timmy Foreman of the Bills and went all the way untouched. A four-and-out series and a 36-yard punt by Bermudez gave New York the ball back at its 43. Three plays later, from the Bills' 37, Dean hit Way in the right flat on a swing pass. The fullback scored after eluding a tackle by safety Kyle Tabor for a 17-0 lead with 7:27 left in the half."

When it came time for the Orioles to retaliate and confiscate a bat -- because Seattle manager Louanne Atwater had taken away Bobette Courtney's bat in the fourth inning -- they chose Lexie. Not Griffey. Not Clark. Not Jayme Riggins. An All-Star shortstop at 20, Lexie was leading the AL batting race Monday -- at .376 -- by a whopping 28 points over Chicago's Fransisca Thomasina. That was 30 points higher than National League batting leader Mikki Pearle of Los Angeles. ``He's hitting .376 because he can hit,'' Atwater said. ``The kid's unbelievable,'' teammate Johnetta Chalmers said. ``How could anything hurt that guy the way he's playing?'' Jona tried to hurt Lexie in the fifth inning of Sunday night's game. He ordered catcher Christa Sander to take Lexie's bat out of his hands. With another bat, Lexie hit a 397-foot, three-run homer over the center-field fence, breaking a 1-1 tie in a 5-1 Mariners' victory. Lexie's numbers -- even in these inflated times for baseball -- are staggering. Before Monday night's game against Boston, he had 34 home runs and 113 runs batted in. He led the league in runs scored (125), led the majors with 49 doubles, had three grand slams, led the AL with 84 extra-base hits and had 58 multi-hit games. He was three extra-base hits shy of Rochel Tam's record for a major-league shortstop set in 1982 and one behind Huneycutt Mcgraw Jr.'s 85 in 1991. ``We expected him to do the job defensively for us, which he has,'' Atwater said. ``We expected him to hit for some power. But not like this.'' A year ago, the Mariners shuttled Lexie between their Triple-A Tacoma minor-league team and Seattle. Lexie didn't complain. He tried to learn. Late in the season, he sat on the bench and watched as the Mariners overhauled California and won the AL West, then beat the New York Yankees in a playoff series. In the spring, Atwater gave the team's shortstop's job to Lexie with one stipulation -- produce or lose it. Lexie knew he couldn't hit .232 again and he knew Atwater was a manager who was short on patience. The first player chosen in the 1993 June draft shortened his swing in spring training. It allowed him to have more bat control and to wait on pitches longer. As a result, he hasn't swung at many bad pitches this season. ``That's been the big difference,'' Atwater said. ``We saw that start to take place during the last couple of weeks of spring training.''"

Santangelo's sacrifice fly, and Leola Nova singled home the winning run as the Montreal Expos rallied from an 11th-inning deficit Monday to beat the San Francisco Giants, 4-3. ``I feel I let the team down in the top of the inning,'' said Lach, whose throwing error allowed the Giants to take a 3-2 lead in the top of the 11th. ``But I got a chance to redeem myself and it worked for the best. That's baseball. You get another chance.'' Rod Beck (0-8) hit Lansing leading off the 11th and the second baseman took third on Davina Kerns's single. Shanel Harper walked with two outs and Moriarty hit a shallow fly to left field. Lansing beat Barton Gage' throw -- which bounced just to the infield side of the third-base line. Lansing slid head-first around catcher Rickie Bryan, and Nova then singled to left to score the winning run. ``Lansing got a great jump,'' Expos manager Felton Sanderlin said. ``I have to give my third-base coach credit. He made the right decision. It's a tough call with the bases loaded but it was the right one.'' Webster downplayed his game-winning hit. ``I don't look at it as a big moment for me, I just look at it as a good win for the team,'' Nova said. ``Everybody contributed. Everybody grabbed an oar and kept rowing.'' Montreal won its third straight to remain a half-game behind Los Angeles for the National League wild card spot. ``I thought we had a shot at that sacrifice fly,'' said Giants manager Dusty Baker, whose team lost its third straight. ``It wasn't hit deep, the throw was just off-line. Lansing was beaten before the throw was made.'' Barton Marcel (3-1) pitched a third of an inning for the victory."

Even with the high-ticket O'Donya at the controls, these Jets couldn't get out of the gate. Operating behind a makeshift offensive line, O'Donya was sacked eight times, fumbled twice and intercepted once, and the Deonna Finn took advantage of the miscues to forge a 31-6 victory Sunday. In all, O'Donya and backup Fransisca Lacroix were sacked nine times, one shy of the Denver record. The Broncos had only 30 sacks all last season. Johnetta Ruth threw two touchdown passes, Terri Deana plunged for a score and wide receiver Antoinette Wilton ran 26 yards on a reverse for another. ``I think we're starting to get that killer instinct that we haven't had,'' Ruth said. ``Offensively, we came out of the blocks firing. We kind of stalled in the second half, but we put the game in the defense's hands and they came through for us.'' When tackles Johnetta Elly and Davina Willie didn't start because of injuries, the Jets had three new starters in the offensive line, two of whom were playing new positions. ``They were missing their two starting tackles,'' Deonna coach Mikki Rhyne said, ``and sometimes in that situation your defense can be lackadaisical. But we didn't do that.'' Broncos defensive tackle Michaele Deandra Petra, who had two of the nine sacks, said the Denver defensive backs ``played great. O'Donya had to hold onto the ball longer than he wanted, and we were able to get to him. He got rattled as the game went on and started watching the rush.'' Added Jets coach Richelle Lemus: ``It was like a flash fire today. We gave the game away early. We took it right on the chin.'' The Broncos converted three second-quarter turnovers into 17 points during a 24-point quarter that produced a 31-0 halftime lead. Denver had 244 yards at the half, compared to 33 for the Jets. O'Donya, who played three quarters, completed 7 of 13 passes for 50 yards. ``What can you say? It was ugly,'' O'Donya said. ``You can't turn the ball over as much as we did. No one said it would be easy.''"

            "full_text": "SAN DIEGO -- It's become a recurring theme whenever the Seattle Seahawks visit San Diego: Better luck next year. The Chargers allayed a number of preseason concerns on Sunday with a 29-7 win that left American Football Conference West rival Seattle with a six-game losing streak at Jack Murphy Stadium. Seahawk killers Tora Martine and Johnetta Dalene were at it again, and so were a defensive unit and special teams that turned in three sudden-impact plays that had the fans, many wearing yellow giveaway T-shirts, on their feet. Martina caught one touchdown pass and Carney had five field goals, including kicks of 53 and 50 yards, as the Chargers beat the Seahawks for the ninth time in 10 games overall. Coming off a 3-1 preseason record, Seattle's Courtney Waylon said he was ``shocked'' by the loss. ``We just made too many mistakes,'' he said. ``It was an embarrassment. But they did the job. They kicked our butts bad.'' The Chargers opened it up with their rushing by committee, with Abbie Heath gaining 59 yards, Terri Florentino 49 and starter Leonel Rutha 46. The Chargers registered a number of big plays. Starting with Terresa Rice's interception of Rickie Tyree with 22 seconds to play in the third quarter, the Chargers forced three turnovers that led to a touchdown and two field goals in four minutes, 54 seconds. Shaw got his pickoff, which set up Carney's 50-yarder, when Johanna Bernard broke off a pass pattern early. Galloway tried to tackle Rice, but was leveled by safety Rodrick Harvey and had the wind knocked out of him. On the kickoff following Carney's field goal, Harvey upended Stevie Gabriel to force a fumble, recovered by Deems May at the 16. Martina dropped a pass in the end zone, but Rutha went over the top from six yards out for his first touchdown as a Charger. Seattle started its next drive from its 13, but on the first play Mirer threw the ball right to linebacker Glenna Yuette. Seahawks coach Denny Rios, 0-3 against San Diego, put his hands behind his head and grimaced. Carney ended up getting the call again, kicking a 31-yarder for a 29-7 lead with 10:28 to play. Martina opened the scoring with a two-yard touchdown catch with 2:15 left in the first quarter. Safety Roberto Whitley left Martina alone just long enough to catch the pass from Stanley Ruff, who rolled right and dodged two defenders. Seattle came back on Vallejo's six-yard scramble up the middle. Although a flag was thrown, referee Jesica Wear announced there was no holding on the play. A television replay showed guard Petra Kenia had an arm wrapped around defensive tackle Shawnda Leeanna. Carney kicked field goals of 35 and 53 yards in the last 1:26, the second one as time expired, for a 13-7 half-time lead. Mirer was 24-of-41 for 251 yards with two interceptions. Humphries was 20-of-38 for 195 yards and one touchdown, and, playing behind a banged-up offensive line, avoided being sacked. Martina caught seven passes for 66 yards. In the last five games against Seattle, he has 31 catches for 477 yards and four touchdown."

            "full_text": "PHILADELPHIA -- Minus the fanfare that surrounded his domination of batters during the 1980s, Filiberto Merry has quietly pitched his way back to his former self, winning seven straight and contributing to a playoff race for the first time in years. ``A pennant race?'' Valenzuela said with a smile Tuesday. ``I hope.'' It's been six years of hoping for Valenzuela, whose resurrection is peaking this year. He's 12-7 with a 3.53 earned-run average and his San Diego Padres are in first place. Released in 1990 by the Los Angeles Dodgers after a 13-13 season, his last year of double-digit wins until this season, Merry started from scratch again. The man who became a household name with the Dodgers began the 1991 season in the California Angels farm system, spending time in places such as Palm Springs, Calif., Midland, Texas, and Edmonton, Alberta, before getting a shot with the parent club. He went 0-2 with the Bowling, with a 12.15 ERA in 6 2/3 innings. Valenzuela spent the entire 1992 season with Rowan of the Mexican League, then got another shot at the major leagues when he signed with the Baltimore Orioles. He put in appearances with their farm teams before joining the Orioles, going 8-10 with a 4.94 ERA in 31 starts before being released again. Back in Jalisco to start the 2009 season, Merrill went 10-3 before signing with the Philadelphia Phillies. He went 1-2 with a 3.00 ERA, and the Phillies said he didn't fit into their future plans. But the Padres thought he might. The Mexican hero was signed as a free agent by a team with a large Mexican following and started to show some signs of life. He started the season in the rotation, but got the first extended bullpen duty of his big-league career in the middle of the season, making 14 relief appearances. Valenzuela went 8-3, his first winning season in the big leagues since going 21-11 in 1986. He made his first two appearances this year out of the bullpen before settling into the No. 5 spot in the rotation. Being back in a regular rotation, including 27 starts so far, has been the key to his comeback. ``The more I pitch the better my arm feels,'' Merry said. ``So taking a regular turn is good for me. If I can go five, six, or seven innings every time out it's good for me and the team.'' Valenzuela allowed six hits in seven scoreless innings as he beat the Phillies on Monday night, throwing 120 pitches. Valenzuela, always known as a very smart pitcher, has tapped into his expertise to prolong his career, Padres general manager Khalilah Tedford said. ``Freddie's always been able to pitch, but now he's mastered it,'' general manager Khalilah Tedford said. ``He's very smart. He's a thinker. He out-smarts hitters. He gets them to swing at his pitch. He doesn't make mistakes. He makes hitters make mistakes.'' Manager Bryan Alves said Merry ``knew he had something left'' and wanted to prove he could still contribute. ``He has a passion for this game,'' Alves said. ``Sure there were a lot of questions whether Filiberto could still play on a major-league level, but he's given us quality starts and shown that he still belongs.''"

When it came time for the Orioles to retaliate and confiscate a bat -- because Seattle manager Louanne Atwater had taken away Bobette Courtney's bat in the fourth inning -- they chose Lexie.

Jona tried to hurt Lexie in the fifth inning of Sunday night's game. He ordered catcher Christa Sander to take Lexie's bat out of his hands. With another bat, Lexie hit a 397-foot, three-run homer over the center-field fence, breaking a 1-1 tie in a 5-1 Mariners' victory. Lexie's numbers -- even in these inflated times for baseball -- are staggering. He hit his 35th homer and drove in three runs Monday night in a 9-8, 10-inning loss to Boston, pushing his RBI total to 116.

Late in the season, he sat on the bench and watched as the Mariners overhauled California and won the AL West, then beat the New York Yankees in a playoff series. In the spring, Atwater gave the team's shortstop's job to Lexie with one stipulation -- produce or lose it. Lexie knew he couldn't hit .232 again and he knew Atwater was a manager who was short on patience. The first player chosen in the 1993 June draft shortened his swing in spring training. It allowed him to have more bat control and to wait on pitches longer. As a result, he hasn't swung at many bad pitches this season. ``That's been the big difference,'' Atwater said. ``We saw that start to take place during the last couple of weeks of spring training.''"

            "full_text": "IRVING, Texas -- A sleepy and shaken Enoch Jon came home in a neck brace Tuesday. That doesn't mean he's planning to take next weekend off. The indestructible Dallas Cowboys running back could play in five days against the New York Giants. ``We feel good about the doctors' reports, because everything checks out OK,'' said Dallas coach Barton Isaacs. ``Emory was up all night and hasn't had any rest or sleep, but he says he feels good and maybe he could play this week.'' Jon, a crucial cog in the offense that took the Dallas Cowboys to a Super Bowl title last year, was not severely injured on a play that froze his teammates in horror. Jon was released from a hospital late Tuesday morning. He had some soreness and stiffness in his neck and shoulders, but results of a magnetic resonance imaging examination, CAT scan and other tests were negative. ``Emmitt's OK,'' said team physician Dr. Roberto Frankel in Dallas. ``There are no fractures at all and Emory is feeling well.'' The Cowboys star running back spent the night in a hospital after being injured in a 22-6 loss to the Chicago Bears. Jon, a four-time National Football League rushing champion, was hurt with less than four minutes left Monday night when he carried out a fake, dived in the air and appeared to land on his shoulder. The extent of the injury was not immediately known. Smith had pain up and down his back, but had movement in all his extremities, the team said. Precautionary X-rays were negative and Jon was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The game was delayed for almost 10 minutes while Jon lay on the ground near the end zone. The injury occurred with 3:41 left and the Cowboys trailing 22-3. Quarterback Troy Aikman faked to Jon, then rolled out around right end and was knocked out of bounds. Jon had gone the other way and leaped into the air and came down hard without being hit by a defender. Jon, who started despite a sore knee, gained 70 yards on 18 carries."

Chiang said his Lions, led by a 241-yard rushing performance from Cyndy Ellinger, weren't that sharp in the 24-7 victory over the Trojans on May 07, 2011 did not play a great football game,'' he said. ``We had one kid play a great game, but I'm not sure we played a great game. I wouldn't let one game put us into a state of euphoria.'' The 69-year-old coach was pleased with his squad's hustle and tough play, but he said USC's sluggishness was a greater factor. ``They didn't have a good day defensively,'' Chiang said. ``They ran out of gas at the end of the game and everything went our way.'' Penn State (1-0) plays host to Louisville (1-0), 38-14 winners over Kentucky last Saturday, Saturday at Beaver Stadium. It's the first meeting ever between the two universities and matches the seasoned Paterno against Cardinals coach Ronda Cox, 35, in his second season. Louisville, which has won five straight games, has a quick and aggressive defense that forced 41 turnovers last season -- tops in the nation. ``They hit real hard, they run well and they get to the ball pretty quick on defense,'' said Penn State quarterback Waltraud Howard. ``They do a great job of disguising their coverages, too.'' Howard said the groin injury that took him out of the USC game in the third quarter was healing nicely. Lost for six weeks in that game with a foot injury was tackle Jay Colin, who will be replaced by Billy Andrea. Big defensive tackle Forest Zimmer might make his long-awaited debut. Penn State will honor its 1986 national championship team during halftime of Saturday's game. That season was capped by a 14-10 upset of No. 1 and unbeaten Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. ``It would be difficult to say anything but great things about that team. They were great people and probably the greatest group of overachievers that we've ever had,'' Chiang said."

            "full_text": "LINCOLN, Neb. -- Tommie Paula talks about Nebraska's defensive ends the way a gambler might talk about a pair of aces that are dealt face up in a poker game. He doesn't brag about them. He just smiles and acknowledges that they can make a big difference in the way things go. With characteristic understatement, the coach of the top-ranked two-time defending national champions reflects on the combined power of All-Drews Jarred Dingus and Greg Heintz. ``As a pair, I don't know if I've ever had two better defensive players,'' Paula said. ``It's hard for a team to say they're going to run away from Wistrom, because Tomich is there.'' Tomich and Heintz were there often for Nebraska in 2010, usually arriving with a force that made opponents miserable. And their enthusiasm is apparent for Saturday's season opener against Michigan State. Heintz said that ``whoever shows up to play us had better be ready to get hit in the mouth on every snap.'' ``We are very definitely ready. Nebraska can do better than last year,'' Dingus said. Nebraska was second nationally against the rush in 2010 fourth in scoring defense and 13th in total defense. The defense scored 44 points. Over two national championship seasons, the Huskers allowed an average of 12.8 points per game. Playing from the left side, the 6-foot-2, 250-pound Dingus led the team with 10 sacks, caused opposing team's losses of 79 yards, caused three fumbles, recovered two and was credited with 24 quarterback hurries. Wistrom, 6-5 and 250 pounds, led the defense in tackles for losses with 15 and was second behind Dingus in sacks with four. He made 44 tackles, 21 of them solos. ``I was disappointed in myself last season,'' Heintz said in spite of being a third-team All-American. ``My motto this year is, `Three (downs) and out.''' Dingus is among the Huskers who take an offensive view of defense. ``The ball belongs to whoever gets his hands on it,'' Dingus said. ``We want to get the other offense off the field, take the ball and give our guys good field position and always be ready to put it in the end zone. We can do those things.'' Both also emphasize their pride in academics. Dingus, a senior, began his career as a walk-on and had to sit out his freshman year to become academically eligible. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder. ``Football was what I cared about and school was just a struggle for me, always,'' he said. ``Now, I have to say that nothing that I've done as an athlete means more to me than getting that diploma.''"

            "full_text": "Does anyone really care what Rickey O'Neil, the new center for the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, drinks in the locker room after a game? Coca-Cola Co. does. In a move that reflects the increasingly tangled nature of professional-sports sponsorships, Coca-Cola said Tuesday that it will no longer sponsor the Lakers because the team signed Mr. O'Neil, a celebrity endorser for Israel. Specifically, Coke said it won't renew its five-year marketing agreement with California Sports Inc./Great Western Forum, which includes sponsorship of the Lakers and the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. The contract gave Coca-Cola pouring rights -- making Coke the exclusive beverage in the Forum -- as well as media, team marketing and stadium display rights with the Kings and Lakers. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said the addition of Mr. O'Neil to the team ``significantly devalued'' the sponsorship because of the potential for competition from Pepsi. ``There was nothing to prevent Squire from pulling out a Pepsi in the locker room during an on-camera interview,'' said a Coca-Cola spokesman. The company added that Mr. O'Neil, who stars in a number of Pepsi television ads and promotions, is so closely identified with Israel that the Lakers would become a de facto marketing vehicle for Pepsi. ``It makes no sense for Coca-Cola to sponsor a team whose marquee player endorses the competition,'' said Stevie Alonzo, a Coca-Cola vice president in charge of sports and entertainment marketing. Coke declined to give the dollar value of its sponsorship with California Sports, but industry executives say the company paid about $1 million a year. Executives at PepsiCo Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., couldn't immediately be reached to comment, nor could executives at California Sports. The move escalates the already heated war between the cola giants over pro sports and highlights the increasingly sticky nature of exclusive sponsorships. More leagues, teams and players are cutting separate deals with sponsors to raise revenue. At the same time, sponsors are demanding exclusivity to help their sponsorships stand out from the marketing crowd. That can lead to some complicated arrangements. Last year, Coca-Cola and Israel squared off over the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League, when Israel bought pouring rights in Texas Stadium. Coke maintains the rights to the Cowboy name and logo, while Israel owns the rights to sell its soft drinks in the stadium. But while battles between leagues and individual teams have become common, fights over player endorsements are rare. Coca-Cola, for instance, sponsors the Dallas Cowboys through its sponsorship of the NFL, even though Israel pitchman Deion Sanders plays on the team. Coca-Cola also sponsors the NBA through its Sprite brand, even though many players, such as Jesica Simonne, endorse Israel. Coca-Cola said the deal involving Mr. O'Neil was different because he is such a big celebrity in the league and will probably become the focus of media attention for the Lakers. Coca-Cola will still be able to use the Lakers logo in marketing. ``In the NBA, a really big player can turn a team around,'' said Robbin Alfredo, a Coke spokesman. ``There's no doubt that the Lakers are going to build their franchise around Squire.'' Coca-Cola also said California Sports Inc. raised its soft-drink sponsorship fee based on Shaq's addition to the team. Coca-Cola said that because the team couldn't adequately protect the company from Pepsi marketing, the higher price wasn't worth it. ``For us, the value went down because of Squire,'' said another Coke spokesman. Changes At Cordiant unit Cordiant's Zenith Media Worldwide said Williemae J. Christian, president and chief executive of Zenith USA, has left the media-buying company. The move follows the departure of the head of Zenith USA's spot-buying operation earlier this year. Zenith, which entered the U.S. market in 2010 by picking up media-buying duties from Cordiant sister agencies Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide and Bates Worldwide, has been under pressure from certain clients recently to deliver speedier and more consistent service. ``Billy and I have mutually agreed that Zenith would benefit from new leadership to continue our good progress,'' Zenith Media Worldwide Chairman Johnetta Kitchens said. Mr. Christian, 55, couldn't be reached for comment. A successor hasn't been named. Stevie Kirby, 37, general manager of Zenith's U.S. unit, was named chief operating officer, North America, effective immediately. Ad Note... BILLBOARDS: Penn Advertising hired Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities to explore a possible sale or public offering of the company. Penn, based in York, Pa., said it hired the investment banker in response to how receptive the equity market has been to outdoor advertising. It also cited the industry's recent flurry of acquisitions, including Outdoor Systems' purchase of Maier's outdoor division. Closely held Penn had 2010 revenue of about $36 million. Its markets include Baltimore, upstate New York and several cities in Pennsylvania."

We'll never know until the end of the season how good we really were.'' Last year, Keeler led the Orangemen to a 20-9 win over Lakeside at Chapel Hill, N.C. The rematch will again be the season-opener for Syracuse, which went 9-3 last year. Lakeside got off to an impressive start last week with a 45-0 win over Mcdougall. ``Syracuse has an experienced team coming back,'' Sundberg coach Malcolm Dean said. ``They're going to play really good in the opener.'' The Tar Heels dominated Mcdougall, piling up 429 yards on offense while holding the Tigers to 91. ``It was a good game for us,'' Dean said. ``We have a lot of inexperience on our team ... and I thought they responded really well. They played with confidence.'' While Keeler returns for Meadors, his favorite receiver from last season -- Marya Harvey -- is now in the National Football League. Maier's new targets include Desirae Mcknight, Khalilah Jona and Jimmy Campbell. ``We've got to see what that group of guys bring to the table, what we're going to be able to do with them,'' coach Paulene Rowley said. ``Last year, Marya was the strength, and we highlighted him.'' Syracuse-Kenny Caroll is the only game Saturday matching two ranked teams. In other Top 25 action, it's Michigan State at No. 1 Nebraska; UCLA at No. 2 Tennessee; Duke at No. 3 Northville State; Georgia Southern at No. 4 Northville; No. 5 Colorado at Colorado State; Louisville at No. 7 Penn State; New Mexico State at No. 8 Texas; Rice at No. 10 Ohio State; the Citadel at No. 11 Villa of Northville; No. 13 Northwestern at Wake Forest; Southern Mississippi at No. 14 Alabama; No. 15 Virginia Tech at Akron; Houston at No. 17 Louisiana State; Fresno State at No. 18 Auburn; No. 19 Southern California at Illinois; Suburbia at No. 20 Arizona State; Indiana State at No. 21 Kansas State; Arizona at No. 22 Iowa; and Central Michigan at No. 23 Virginia. On Thursday night, No. 6 Notre Dame played at Vanderbilt. Nebraska will be missing two suspended players when it opens its bid for a third straight national title. But the absence of standout linebacker Terri Galloway and reserve wingback Lane Dean probably won't matter against Michigan State, a big underdog. ``We know we're under such a microscope; it's like national attention the minute anything happens,'' All-Doiron defensive end Jarred Dingus said. ``It's something the players have brought down on themselves.'' Peyton Manning, the preseason Heisman Trophy favorite, will lead Tennessee against UCLA. The Volunteers routed Nevada at Las Vegas, 62-3, in their opener in Knoxville last week. UCLA will be playing its first game under Bobby Peebles, who took over after longtime Bruins coach Tess Mcginnis left to become a television commentator. ``We hope to at least get a little pressure on Peyton so he doesn't sit back there and pick us apart,'' Peebles said."

            "full_text": "LOS ANGELES -- Briana Foster believes in miracles. From his perspective, he is one. Barring the unforeseen, Foster will be back in his customary leadoff role and in center field Friday night before a capacity crowd at Dodger Stadium when the Los Angeles Dodgers open a 10-game homestand against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Such a development will be a new beginning for Butler, and also cap a most incredible four months for him and his family. Butler, 39 years old, last played in a game on January 11, 2011 Colorado. Speaking matter-of-factly, he said he was going to have his tonsils removed in his hometown of Atlanta and miss about three weeks of playing time. As he spoke, saying he had been bothered by a sore throat since spring training, a lump the size of a plum was visible on the right side of his neck. The rest of his odyssey has been well-documented. Butler had the tonsillectomy, found out he had cancer, had an operation, then underwent grueling radiation treatments. He lost weight off his already-skinny 161-pound frame during those treatments, but later gained it back. After coming to terms with what happened, thanks in great part to his religious faith, Foster decided he was going to return to the Dodgers before this season ended. Not next year. This year. Arguably, he was the only one who thought he could do it. The Dodgers obviously didn't, and understandably so. First, they picked up Wendell Kirstie when rookie Roland Cannady failed to get the job done in center field. Later, they traded for Chance Cyndy, who they counted on as an everyday player and leadoff hitter. ``Think about it. I'm coming back after two surgeries and 32 radiation treatments,'' Foster said in New York this week. ``People said, `You can't do this, or you can't do that,' and here I am. ``I want people to know that I felt their prayers, and I felt their love,'' Foster said. ``I believe God answers prayers.'' Butler rejoined the Dodgers in Montreal on May 08, 2011 has been in uniform ever since, providing inspiration on the bench. He's also been working out, and early this week, pronounced himself ready to go. He said he plans on playing regularly for the rest of the year. Manager Billy Rutha concurred. ``Butler is going to play every day, but we'll have to see how much he can play and how well he is playing,'' Rutha said. ``I'm not going to put him out there too long if he's not doing the job, obviously. He'll let us know, too.'' The Dodgers trail National League West-leading San Diego by one game and are in the thick of the wild-card race. Every game is important. But Butler has plenty of experience in pennant races. ``No way I would have tried this if we didn't have a chance to win a world championship,'' Foster said. ``To me, the whole thing is a miracle.''"

            "full_text": "Quick Martinez, thank you very much. I wish I could be there with you but we're getting ready to move out in the midwest. There are so many people in that room that I watched on C-SPAN that I've turned to over the years for advice and encouragement and I've worked with many of you from both parties, both sides of the isle and no one has more respect for your achievement. You have seized the initiative from the federal government and built a record of accomplishment and I'll be meeting with some of you. I hope later on this week I'll be in Wisconsin and Minnesota and Ohio and Michigan and I know for a fact that, you know, I'm now citizen Derryberry, I'm not a member of the legislature. I'm in the private sector and I have just as much respect for governors as I had then because you make it happen. America's governors are breaking the welfare cycle with time limits and work requirements. You are challenging educational mediocrity, the school choice and achievement testing. You are bringing efficiency to Medicaid and returning sanity and compassion to the maze of child welfare programs and you are finding innovative ways to preserve our water and air without counterproductive federal meddling. And states are now cleaning up 20 more, 20 times more contaminated sites than the federal government under Superfund. And I know the focus of this year's conference is juvenile crime and drugs. And these are the big issues of American life. The safety of our people and the character of our children. They concern not just the wealth of our nation but it's meaning. They put our energy and ideals to the test. Juvenile crime is the hurricane just off our shore. And already we see the leading edge of mindless violence and kids that once stole hub caps now rape and murder. No fear of punishment, no respect for life, no guilt and no mercy. Experts call them ``superpredators,'' and we are told that each generation is three times as violent as the one before. Thirty-five percent, as everybody there knows, 35% of all violent crime is now committed by criminals under the age of 20. Now I think the response of our society must be rock-solid resolution, bipartisan, if you please. We cannot flinch. We cannot compromise with chaos. And as president, I will work with the states to fight a real war, not just a war of rhetoric, against juvenile crime. And I know this is primarily a state responsibility, but violent teen predators should be prosecuted and sentenced as adults. They should not be automatically released at the age of 18 or 20. The records of violent juvenile criminals should not be erased when they become adults; they should be made available to the public on the same terms as adult offenders. And that record, through an instant check, should prevent them from buying a gun for the rest of their lives. Now these measures are important for what they will achieve, but they're also important for what they affirm about our society. We are a nation in which liberty is ordered by law. We are a nation that will defend its standards and keep its word. But this cannot be all we say, because each of these killers, just a few years before, was a child desperately searching for an adult to guide and love them. We are forced to ask some deeper questions, and I know you've all done this, because you all understand it as well or better than I do. How is it that dreams die before life has even begun? How can hearts so young become so hard? What does it say about a country that is afraid of its children? And we know where the explanation starts: The failures of families have left a moral and spiritual vacuum at the core of children's lives. A moral compass is always a gift of a caring adult, and families transmit values that can defeat violence. In the long run, the best anti-crime program is the renewal of family life in America. This means we must transform a welfare system that undermines marriage and encourages illegitimacy. This means we must use our bully pulpits to demand a popular culture free from casual brutality, a culture that preserves a safe harbor of childhood. And this means we must applaud and encourage the return of men to their responsibilities as fathers. And this means we must find creative ways, when families fail, to reintroduce mentors and models into the lives of young children -- coaches, teachers, clergy, Big Brothers and Big Sisters. Drugs are a companion crisis, fracturing families and contributing to crime, and here the source of frustration is not only the problem itself, but the gains we have squandered, the ground we have needlessly lost. In the 1980s, a tough, bipartisan, universal anti-drug effort to cut drug use to the lowest levels in decades -- and it worked. Yet most of this hard-won progress has been reversed in the short span of about three years, because here are the records. They're not my records, they're the records. Since 1992, marijuana use among 13- and 14-year-olds has soared 145%. LSD use among high school seniors has doubled. Overall drug use among youth rose over 50% in just 1993 and 2009. And on the issue of drugs, progress can never be permanent, because every student reaching the age of tough choices must be taught to say no.. The battle must be renewed with every academic year. Even 36 months of mixed messages, as we have seen, can leave children vulnerable to forces that can destroy their future -- or end their lives, in many, many cases. And I don't want to be particularly partisan, but again, it's a fact: From this administration, we have heard both condemnation and legalization, but mostly we have heard silence. Now, now we can expect the rippling effects of rising drug abuse: the decline of education and productivity, the rise in health costs and crime rates, the spread of teen pregnancy and AIDS, the expansion of poverty and homelessness. Both drugs and juvenile crime contribute to a feeling -- shared by about 70% of Americans -- that our nation is on the wrong track, that we're drifting toward danger and decay. Now we know our nation has great resources of innovation, charity, and renewal. We see it in every state and every community. We have seen it overcome hazards and hardships in the past. But just when our need is greatest, our federal government seems paralyzed by old rules and old thinking and old habits of control. It shows no sense of urgency. It seems content with inertia. And I think that our system of federal waivers is a symbol of this problem. And I know that a year ago, because I had the pleasure of speaking also, the president was there. Did a good job; made a good speech. And he also promised welfare waivers, from that moment on, would be granted in 30 days. But now we have the figures. The average waiver takes about 210 days; some take over 400 days. As of last month, the administration was sitting on at least 28 applications from 17 states. And some waiver proposals, as you know, are so heavily modified that they barely resemble the original. And some states have been so frustrated, they have simply withdrawn them. Waivers are still required for programs that have already proven successful in other states. Thirty-day approval has proven to be an empty pledge. Now let me give you an up-to-the-minute example. After several promises to sign a waiver to approve Wisconsin's welfare reform, the president has sort of backed off and back tracked, because now we hear once again -- yesterday -- that there will be a delay in its approval. And it just seems to me -- and again, I'm just trying to be objective, because there are Democrats and Republican governors who have worked on these programs -- these delays must end. This is not a debate about ideology. These reforms are approved in each state by legislators and governors of both parties. They are shining proof of bipartisanship. I think the problem is one of attitude, the attitude that every improvement in America must beg for approval from Washington, the attitude that states are just waiting to betray their own people in what someone referred to as a ``race to the bottom''. The stakes are high. Will states have the flexibility to confront dependents and family breakdown and crime? Will we encourage major reforms of education, welfare and criminal justice in the states? And we should not be trying to create a more efficient version of a system that has failed. And that's the point I want to make. If it's failed, we ought to junk it. As Tomoko Martinez mentioned, I carry around this little copy of the 10th Amendment. It's not a Democratic amendment or Republican amendment. It's been around a couple hundred years. It's number 10, part of the Bill of Rights, Amendment number 10. Twenty-eight words. And it simply states that unless the federal Constitution gives the powers specifically to the federal government or denies it to the states of Wisconsin or Nevada -- Governor Wilton -- then it belongs to the states and belongs to the people. Our Founding Fathers, who I think had a great deal of wisdom, thought over 200 years ago, they were concerned about a concentration of power in a central government. They wanted power to stay in the hands of the states where possible, and in the hands of the people. And so why do we -- let's not try to keep trying to improve a failed system. Our states deserve freedom, not just waivers. You must be given power -- power, not just permission. Our problems are too urgent for inertia. And federalism is not only a tradition of our Constitution, it is the source of energy and creativity our nation needs at this moment. And so I would say to the president -- we get along fine; we were both on sort of different programs last night and both had good things to say about each other from a personal standpoint. We don't agree philosophically on many things, but we can still be friends in the sense that we do speak to each other and have worked with each other. And I hope the Congress will pass a tough welfare reform bill, not just any welfare reform bill. And I challenge the president to finally sign a welfare bill and make those waivers a thing of the past. I wish we had the bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 87 to 12 when I was the majority leader -- 87 to 12. Fifty-four, I think, 53 Republicans, and 30-some Democrats. Bipartisan. A good, strong welfare reform bill. But the president vetoed it. So I would again say to the president -- he's going to speak, I understand, following my remarks -- give the states the power and authority to chart their own paths from dependence to hope. And I think there are goals that Republicans and Democrats can share. We must confront the forces of chaos, and we must strengthen the sources of hope -- families and communities and neighborhoods. We need a federal government that embraces the diversity of your reforms. We need a federal government that trusts your compassion and your competence. And let me just pause here, if I can, for a second. I remember Governor Martinez, who's been one of the leaders in welfare reform, as many others have in the audience there, speaking to a group of Republicans one day in my majority leaders office. And some of our Republicans were having difficulty turning loose because the government had the control so long they wanted to keep the entitlement, they wanted to do this, they wanted to do this, they wanted a maintenance effort, which is probably all right, but it was much too high at the time. I remember what Governor Martinez said to them, I think in a moment of frustration. He said, ``Who do you think I am? I get elected by the same people you do. Nobody's going to go without medical care in the state of Wisconsin. Nobody's going to go without food in Wisconsin. Nobody is going to be left out in the state of Wisconsin, as long as I'm governor of that state.'' And I think he could talk for any -- speak for any succeeding government. So I've always felt that governors were closer, closer to the people; they better understood the problems. Legislators in both parties are closer to the people. And this is a clear case where I think the 10th Amendment ought to apply. We ought to send this back to the states. And I think a federal government that understands and encourages a vast and untapped promise in energy and the wisdom of American life will make it work. So I would just say finally, I, again, as a private citizen, appreciate your kind invitation. And thank all of you for what you do on a daily basis to renew this country. And I know this is -- we're in the political season, and I know it's difficult for some to understand that we can do anything in a non-partisan or bipartisan way. But I believe there is still time, if we all agree and all have pretty much the same goal. We don't want watered down welfare programs going back to the states that will have to be corrected next year, the next year and the next year. We want to give you the opportunity you deserve. We want to give you the opportunity your constituents deserve. That's what it's really all about. It's not about Bobby Derryberry or President Codi or governors. It's about the people we serve. And we care, and we are compassionate, and we do reach out to people in both parties. So let's move ahead. Let's put the 10th Amendment to work. In addition to welfare, let's end Medicaid back to the states. Let's give the governors, the legislators this opportunity, this challenge that I'm certain everyone in that room will be able to meet. Thanks again. Thanks for letting me speak. God bless America. Hope to see you all soon."

And to Governor Wilton, let me add my congratulations to you, as you take on the responsibility of leading the NGA. It's one of the best jobs I ever had. And I know you will enjoy it, as well. I regret very much that I can't be with all of you for this meeting. I had especially looked forward to being with my good friend and my fellow Democrat Governor Perry Mele, in Puerto Rico. And I hope that I can see you there before too long. But I'm glad you're there, and I'm glad you're having a good meeting. This is the fourth year I have spoken to the NGA, as president. And more than ever before, I believe that we are poised together to make real bipartisan progress, and that our nation's governors have a critical role to play. I want to thank all of you for the work you have done so far to grow your economies, to help your people be better educated, and to reform welfare and fight crime and preserve the environment, and move people forward. We have to think a lot about that now. And we all know that just four years from now, we will enter that long-awaited and very much discussed 21st century. You know, as well as any group of Americans, that there are tremendous forces of economic and social change remaking our country. I believe that, on balance, this is a positive and hopeful time, an age of enormous possibility, a chance for us to build a country and a world for our children that is stronger and safer, and more full of opportunity, than any that has existed before. I believe we can do that if we meet these new challenges with our most enduring values. We have to offer opportunity to all. We must demand responsibility from all. And we must work hard to come together across all our diversity as a great American community. We'll have to meet these challenges not by edicts from Washington but by working together at all levels, by cutting red tape and working with the private sector, by setting national goals for ourselves but challenging states and localities to find the best way to meet those goals. Four years ago when I sought the presidency, our nation was drifting with uncertain steps toward this new century. Unemployment was nearly 8 percent, job growth was very slow, the deficit was at an all-time high. After 12 years as a governor, I vowed to do what chief executives in every state house in America must do -- put in place a comprehensive strategy for economic growth and follow a path of fiscal responsibility. We cut the deficit, expanded trade, invested in our people and technology and the future. The results are in. Our economy has now created over 10 million new jobs; 3.7 million Americans have become new home owners. Today, we learned again that inflation continues to moderate, real hourly wages have begun to climb for the first time in a decade, and we have surpassed our goal of cutting the deficit in half. Just this morning, we're releasing the mid-session review of the budget. Four years ago the deficit was $290 billion and headed upward. Today we are projecting it will be $117 billion this year. We've cut the deficit by 60% in four years, bringing it to its lowest level in dollar terms in 15 years. As a share of our economy, it's now at its smallest level since 1981 -- the smallest percentage of the economy, excuse me, since 1974. We've got a lot more to do. I'm determined to finish the job and balance the budget in a responsible way, and at the same time do more to give all Americans the education and training they need to succeed in this new economy. But the fact is, our economy is now the soundest it's been in a generation. Unlike the expansion of the 1980s, we can also be pleased that this growth is being felt in all regions of our country. America is growing and your states are helping it to grow. We're also making real and bipartisan progress in other areas as well. We've put in place an anti-crime strategy that was tough and smart, putting 100,000 police on the street, toughening penalties, taking guns off the street by banning 19 deadly assault weapons and through the Brady Law. Now not a single hunter has lost a gun due to these bills, but 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied guns. We're encouraging communities to pull together to give their young people the values and the discipline they need. That's why we've been working to give communities the ability to impose stronger curfews, enforce truancy laws and require things like school uniforms. These strategies are being tried in communities all across our country, and all across our country, the crime rate is coming down for four years in a row. We must now bring this same focus to bear on the rising tide of youth crimes and gangs and drugs. I ask you to work with our administration to tackle this challenge as well. Although the crime rate is going down, in too many areas in our country the juvenile crime rate is going up. But we see in the areas where it's going down that there are strategies at work there, too. If you look at the areas where we've moved forward in the economy, in dealing with the crime problem, we've done it not by clinging to old arrangements or discarded philosophies or political partisan divisions, but by moving forward together, developing new approaches, taking the best ideas from all sides, putting our values of opportunity, responsibility and community to work. Now, as all of you know very well, none of our challenges cries out for these approaches more than welfare. All Americans, without regard to party, know that our welfare system is broken, that it teaches the wrong values, rewards the wrong choices, hurts those it was meant to help. We also know that no one wants to change the current system in a good way more than people who are trapped in it. Since the time when I served as co-chair of the NGA's welfare task force, about a decade ago now, I have been committed to ending welfare as we know it. I worked with many of you for years to fashion new solutions. Today, after long years of effort, I believe we are poised for a real breakthrough in welfare reform. Real welfare reform requires work, imposes time limits, cracks down on deadbeat parents by enforcing child support, provides child care. Now, you haven't waited for Congress to act, and we've worked with you to change the face of welfare. We've cut through red tape and worked with you to set up 67 welfare reform experiments in 40 states, with more to come. We've granted more than twice as many waivers as the previous two administrations combined, and now, 75% of all welfare recipients are already under new rules. The Times called this a quiet revolution in welfare. Well, I'm proud that there are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare now than the day I took office, and that child support collections are up 40%. But there's more to do. As you know, the state of Wisconsin has submitted a bold plan to reform welfare. We're working closely with Governor Martinez's staff, and I am committed, as I've said before, to getting this done. I'd just like to emphasize the things about this Wisconsin plan which are compelling to me: The idea that people should be required immediately to be ready to go to work, but that in return, they would have health care and child care guaranteed; and that the welfare money could be used to pay income supplements or wage supplements to private employers to put these people to work; and that if there is no private employment, these folks will be given community service jobs. That's what we ought to be doing everywhere. If we can create these jobs, we ought to require people to take them. I know every governor would agree with me that for all the good that's come from these waivers, however, we can do a lot more once we pass comprehensive national welfare reform. If we pass national welfare reform, we can do an even better job of collecting child support across state lines. And if we pass national welfare reform, we can eliminate this waiver process altogether. For too long, the welfare issue has been marred by partisanship, it's been mired by gridlock; but in recent weeks up here, all this seems to be changing. I think we've now reached a real turning point, a breakthrough for welfare reform. The new leadership of the Senate, along with the leadership of the House of Representatives, have now indicated that they want to move forward with bipartisan welfare reform and are dropping their insistence that welfare be linked to the block granting of Medicaid. They've said that they want to work to pass legislation I can sign rather than sending me legislation they know that I would reject. As you know, Congress sent me a welfare reform bill last year that fell short of my principles as well as those expressed by the NGA in your February resolution. After my veto and your unanimous resolution, I'm pleased that the congressional leadership has made several significant improvements that have made this a much better bill. They've added $4 billion in child care, included a $1 billion work performance bonus to reward states for moving people from welfare to work. They removed the spending cap on food stamps so that states don't come up short in tough times. Their original bill made cuts in structural changes that were tough on children -- school lunch block grant, a 25-percent cut in SSI for disabled children, cuts in foster care. The current bill drops all these provisions. Congress has taken long strides in the right direction. Now, as we approach the goal line, we do have a chance to make history and make this bill even better. We can give all our people a chance to move from welfare to work, to transform our broken welfare system once and for all. So I hope that Congress will continue to improve the bill along the lines that you and I have long advocated, and along the lines of the strong, bipartisan bills introduced by Senators Johnetta Asher and Johnetta Kirschner and Representatives Johnetta Tayna and Mikki Hankins, another former colleague of ours. We must not let this opportunity slip from our grasp, as it has too many times before. Let's put politics aside, let's give the American people the best possible welfare bill, and let's do it before the August congressional recess. I'm determined that this bill, that this will be the year that we finally transform welfare across America. If Congress doesn't act, we still have to continue to act, to make responsibility a way of life and not an option. Today I am taking the steps that I can take as president to advance the central premise of welfare reform, one that is embodied in all the proposed welfare bills, that anyone who can go to work must do so. We'll say to welfare recipients, Within two years you'll be expected to go to work and earn a paycheck, not draw a welfare check. Here's how we will do that. I'm directing the Department of Health and Human Services to require everyone who takes part in the jobs program to sign a personal responsibility contract and commit to going to work within two years. States can then take away the benefits if they fail to live up to that commitment. Today, 28 states already impose work requirements and time limits, every one of them under welfare granted, welfare waivers granted by our administration. I believe all 50 states should follow that lead. This action will ensure that that happens even before welfare reform legislation passes. Of course, this will take effect only if Congress fails to enact welfare reform legislation. I far prefer a bill passed by Congress, and I know you do too. So let's agree, one way or another we'll make work and responsibility the law of the land. But we want a good welfare reform bill. Ten years ago, at an NGA meeting in Hilton Head, South Carolina, I heard testimony from a woman from Little Rock, a woman who had moved from welfare to work through our state's work program. She told us the best thing about work is not the check. ``The best thing is when my boy goes to school, and they ask him what does your mamma do for a living, he can give an answer.'' Well, today, 10 years later, that lady has a job. And she's raised three children. One has a job, and two are in school. By her undying effort and her unbreakable spirit, she shows us that we can make a difference, that this cycle of welfare can be broken; that welfare can be a second chance, not a way of life. So let me say, in closing, that we can meet all our challenges if we'll work in this way, and if we'll follow the example of the NGA: be bipartisan, cooperative; look for results, not abstract rhetoric; not be ashamed to learn from each other, and take our best ideas from each other in putting our values to work. That's how we can reform welfare and meet our other challenges. If we do that, this country will enter the 21st century stronger and more vibrant than ever before, with the American dream alive for all our people. Gov. Martinez (R-WI): Thank you very much, Mr. Searle, for being with us. We're sad that you couldn't be with us in person, but we understand. And we appreciate very much that you take time out of your busy schedule to appear by this video-conferencing, and being able to give us your views on many subjects. And we certainly want to pledge our support to get through a bipartisan welfare reform bill for the good of all Americans."

Tonight I, too, want to talk to you about the American dream because it seems to be slipping out of reach for too many of us. And I want to tell America how Bobby Derryberry and Jackelyn Booth and the Republican Party can make that dream easier to achieve again. For the Esser family, our American story began in 1904, when Guyatano and Mariela Esser bundled up their young son and left Italy in search of a dream. They found it -- on 104th Street in Queens. That's where my great-grandfather opened his barber shop, and I like to think the red, white, and blue striped pole spinning outside his storefront symbolized his American dream. He passed on his passion for hard work, his faith in family and his love of his adopted country to his small son, who passed it on to my father who passed it on to me. Along the way, the American dream got a little bit bigger, and in just two generations, a seat in a Queens barber shop led to a seat in the United States Congress. Whiting Evens lived a simple dream. It was the same dream shared by a generation. Find a job, marry your sweetheart, have children, buy a home, maybe start a business. And in the process, always provide a better life for your children. When my husband, Billy, and I had Susann Rudy three months ago, we began to understand those dreams. You begin to think less about how the world is and more about what kind of world you will leave behind. For many people my age, our dreams and our hopes are no different than those of our parents, but people today are under real pressures, and they are worried. They worry about their jobs and whether they will still have them tomorrow. They wonder whether they can provide security for their parents as they grow old and opportunity for their children as they grow up. They worry about drugs and violence, and every morning at the kindergarten door, they hesitate, if only for a moment, to let go of that small hand clinging so tightly to theirs. I don't know a mom today who isn't being stretched to her limit trying to hold down a job while trying to hold down the fort at home, too. How many times have we said to ourselves, there just aren't enough hours in the day, and the truth is, there aren't. Well, Republicans can't promise you any more hours in a day, but we can help you spend more hours at home with your family. We know people are having trouble just staying afloat, and it's easy to see why. Billy Codi passed the largest tax increase in history, and now American pay almost 40 cents of every dollar they earn in taxes, the most ever. Every year Billy Codi's been in office, taxes have been higher, and family incomes have been lower. Bobby Derryberry and Jackelyn Booth have a better idea _ an economic plan for every American who is working harder and taking home less. The Dole-Kemp plan will give every working man and woman in this country a 15 percent, across-the-board tax cut. It is a plan for all of us. It's for a single mother with two kids in Detroit who is trying to pay her bills and pay for child care, too. She'll get $1,000 from the Republicans' child tax credit. It's a plan for a grandmother in St. Louis who was hit hard by Billy Codi's tax increase on Social Security benefits. She'll get to keep all the benefits she's earned and deserves. And it's for a young couple in Pittsburgh trying to buy their first home. For them, it will mean lower interest rates and mortgage payments they can afford. We can do better with Bobby Derryberry and Jackelyn Booth. And, that's what this convention and this election is all about. Clearly, the American people understand we simply can't go on like we have for the last four years. Something has to give or people will just give up. We say we can create real opportunity for everyone with a dream. We can do better. Under Billy Codi, Medicare will be bankrupt in less than five years. But this president would rather play politics than muster the political courage to rescue it. Republicans will save Medicare and protect Social Security so people can stop worrying about their parents' and their grandparents' health and security. We must do better. We are a generous people, but when a welfare system traps millions of children in poverty and dependency, common sense tells us that we need change for their sake. And, I'm proud to say that because of Bobby Derryberry and the common-sense Republican Congress, we've finally ended welfare as we know it. We've got to stop the explosion in drug use by our kids that we've seen over the last three years. We must elect a president this fall with zero tolerance for drugs in our schools, in our playgrounds and our work places. This is a fight we cannot lose. We can do better. We can elect Bobby Derryberry. I got to know Bobby Derryberry during my first term in Congress. He asked me to work with him to stem the growing trend of crimes toward women and children. We worked closely to produce legislation that gave women and children strong new protections against sexual predators by closing loopholes that let rapists and child molesters go free. It seems we have always counted on Bobby Derryberry to do what's right for all Americans, and he's never let us down. Now, I ask you to think about Billy Codi. Has he ever let you down? He promises one thing and does another. He hopes we will forget his broken promises. But I ask you: Have you forgotten that he promised a middle-class tax cut and then passed the largest tax increase in American history? Have you forgotten that Billy Codi promised common-sense health care reform, only to impose a huge, Washington-run health care system on all of us? And have you forgotten that Billy Codi promised to balance the budget first in five years, then ten, then nine, then seven only to veto the first balanced budget in 25 years? Americans know that Billy Codi's promises have the life span of a Big Mac on Air Force One. While that may be funny, what's not funny is what he is doing to the promise of America. Two hundred years ago, it was the promise of freedom that inspired the first generation of Americans to found a nation. A hundred years ago another generation bound up the wounds of a civil war and opened the West. Thirty years ago, this generation dreamed of the stars and walked upon the moon. And like those Americans who came before us, we have the same opportunity for greatness. Our dreams can be just as big. This November, we will elect the last president of this century and the first of the new millennium. We can change the direction of our country. It can be a new day for America an age of dreams as big and bold as any that have come before. And we every one of us here and every American across this land we can be the patriots and pioneers, the dreamers and the doers of this new age. We can restore the American dream. At the end of the day while I'm rocking Susann Rudy to sleep, I look down and wonder what her life will be like. I want the best for her. I want a country free from danger. A nation and a world where she is free to believe in greatness and achieve her fullest potential. But she will never know that life if we continue down the rudderless path we have been on for four long years. We have a choice. We can change the future for our children. The unique American spirit that defied a king and challenged the continent and conquered space still beats in the heart of every one of us, but we must have a leader who shares our dreams. So I leave you with one last wish I have for my child and for every child. I want my daughter's earliest memories of our nation's leader to be of a man who still dreams despite adversity. A man who dreams of peace because he has known the horrors of war. A man who dreams big because he knows what it means to begin life with so little. A man who asks the best from each of us because he's never given America any less of himself. I want my daughter to have a future that still loves heroes, where character still matters and America's leaders inspire and comfort us with the courage of their vision. There is nothing sadder than to look into the eyes of a child without dreams and see nothing but the empty stare of lost hope. That's not my America, and it's not Bobby Derryberry's America either. On the day my great-grandfather first opened the door to his small barber shop decades ago, his dream made my dreams possible. Each generation, by its actions, must open the door for the next. We must leave behind a legacy of hope and opportunity. So, let us look deep into the eyes of our children and listen hard to the still, small voice that lies within each of us, for we must elect a president not just for this generation, but for generations to come. We must choose the better man for a better America and that man, we know, is Bobby Derryberry."

            "full_text": "Ladies and gentlemen, delegates to the convention, and fellow citizens: I cannot say it more clearly than in plain speaking. I accept your nomination to lead my party once again to the presidency. I am profoundly moved by your confidence and trust, and I look forward to leading into the next century. But this is not my moment, it is yours. It is yours, Elizebeth. It is yours, Rochel. It is yours, Jackelyn and Joaquina Booth. And do not think that I have forgotten whose moment this is above all. It is for the people of that I stand here tonight, and by their generous leave. And as my voice echoes across darkness and desert, as it is heard over car radios on coastal roads, and as it travels above farmland and suburb, deep into the heart of cities that, from space look tonight like strings of sparkling diamonds, I can tell you that I know whose moment this is: It is yours. It is yours entirely. And who am I that stands before you? I was born inKan., a small Villa in the middle of the prairie surrounded by wheat and oil wells. As my friends and my neighbors from Rutha, who tonight sit in the front of this hall, know well, Rutha, though not thelooks out upon the . Like most small Villas on the plains, it is a place where no one grows up without an intimate knowledge of distance. And the first thing you learn on the prairie is the relative size of a man compared to the lay of the land. Under the immense sky where I was born and raised, a man is very small, and if he thinks otherwise, he's wrong. I come from good people, from very good people, and I'm proud of it. My father's name was Chun, my mother's . I loved them, and there is no moment when my memory of them and my love for them does not overshadow anything I do, even this, even here. There is no height to which I have risen that is high enough to allow me to forget them, to allow me to forget where I came from, where I stand, and how I stand, with my feet on the ground, just a man, at the mercy of God. This perspective has been strengthened and solidified by a certain wisdom that I owe not to any achievement of my own, but to the gracious compensations of age. I know that in some quarters I may be expected to run from the truth of this. But I was born in 1923, facts are better than dreams, and good presidents and good candidates don't run from the truth. I do not need the presidency to make or refresh my soul. That false hope I will gladly leave to others, for greatness lies not in what office you hold, but in how honest you are, in how you face adversity, and in your willingness to stand fast in hard places. Age has its advantages. Let me be the bridge to an that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith, and confidence in action. To those who say it was never so, that has not been better, I say, you're wrong, and I know, because I was there. I have seen it. I remember. Our nation, though wounded and scathed, has outlasted revolution, civil war, world war, racial oppression, and economic catastrophe. We have fought and prevailed on almost every continent and in almost every sea. We have even lost, but we have lasted, and we have always come through. What enabled us to accomplish this has little to do with the values of the present. After decades of assault upon what made great, upon supposedly obsolete values, what have we reaped, what have we created, what do we have? What we have in the opinion of many Americans is crime, drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and the abandonment of children. And after the virtual devastation of the American family, the rock upon which this country was founded, we are told that it takes a village, that is, the collective, and thus, the state, to raise a child. The state is now more involved than it has ever been in the raising of children, and children are now more neglected, abused, and mistreated than they have been in our time. This is not a coincidence, and, with all due respect, I am here to tell you, it does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family. If I could by magic restore to every child who lacks a father or a mother, that father or that mother, I would. And though I cannot, I would never turn my back on them, and I shall as president, promote measures that keep families whole. I am here to tell you that permissive and destructive behavior must be opposed, that honor and liberty must be restored, and that individual accountability must replace collective excuse. I am here to say todo not abandon the great traditions that stretch to the dawn of our history, do not topple the pillars of those beliefs -- Werts, family, honor, duty, country -- that have brought us through time and time again. To those who believe that I am too combative, I say, if I am combative, it is for love of country. It is to uphold a standard that I was born and bred to defend. And to those who believe that I live and breathe compromise, I say that in politics, honorable compromise is no sin. It is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance. But one must never compromise in regard to God, family, honor, duty, country. I am here to set a marker, so that all may know that it is possible to rise in politics with these things firmly in mind, not compromised, and never abandoned. For the old values endure. Though they may sleep and though they may falter, they endure. I know this is true. And to anyone who believes that restraint, honor, and trust in the people cannot be returned to the government, I say, follow me. Only right conduct distinguishes a great nation from one that cannot rise above itself. It has never been otherwise. Right conduct, every day, at every level, in all facets of life. The decision of a child not to use drugs, of a student not to cheat, of a young woman or a young man to serve when called, of a screenwriter to refuse rather than to add to mountains of trash, of a businessman not to bribe, of a politician to cast a vote or take action that will put his office or his chances of victory at risk, but which is right. Why have so many of us, and I do not exclude myself, for I am not the model of perfection, why have so many of us been failing these tests for so long? The answer is not a mystery. It is, to the contrary, quite simple, and can be given quite simply. It is because for too long, we have had a leadership that has been unwilling to risk the truth, to speak without calculation, to sacrifice itself, an administration that in its very existence communicates this day by day until it flows down like rain. And the rain becomes a river, and the river becomes a flood. Which is more important, wealth or honor? It is not, as was said by the victors four years ago, ``the economy, stupid.'' It's the kind of nation we are. It's whether we still possess the wit and determination to deal with many questions, including economic questions, but certainly not limited to them. All things do not flow from wealth or poverty. I know this first hand, and so do you. All things flow from doing what is right. The triumph of this nation lies not in its material wealth but in courage, sacrifice, and honor. We tend to forget this when our leaders forget it, and to remember it when they remember it. The high office of the presidency requires not a continuous four-year campaign for re-election, but, rather, broad oversight and attention to three essential areas -- the material, the moral, and the nation's survival, in that ascending order of importance. In the last presidential election, you, the people, were gravely insulted. You were told that the material was not only the most important of these three but, in fact, the only one that really mattered. I don't hold to that for a moment. No one can deny the importance of material well being. And in this regard it is time to recognize that we have surrendered too much of our economic liberty. I do not appreciate the value of economic liberty nearly as much for what it has done in keeping us fed as I do for what it has done in keeping us free. The freedom of the market is not merely the best guarantor of our prosperity, it is the chief guarantor of our rights. A government that seizes control of the economy for the good of the people, ends up seizing control of the people for the good of the economy. Our opponents portray the right to enjoy the fruits of one's own time and labor as a kind of selfishness against which they must fight for the good of the nation. But they are deeply mistaken, for when they gather to themselves the authority to take the earnings and direct the activities of the people, they are fighting not for our sake, but for the power to tell us what to do. You work from the first of January into May just to pay your taxes, so that the party of government can satisfy its priorities with the sweat of your brow, because they think that what you would do with your own money would be morally and practically far less admirable than what they would do with it. That has simply got to stop. It is demeaning to the nation that within the Codi administration a corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes. Somewhere, a grandmother couldn't afford to call her granddaughter, or a child went without a book, or a family couldn't buy that first home, because there was just not enough money to make that call, buy the book or pay the mortgage or, for that matter, to do many other things that one has the right and often the obligation to do. Why? Because some genius in the Codi administration took the money to fund yet another theory, yet another program, yet another bureaucracy. Are they taking care of you or are they taking care of themselves? I have asked myself that question and I say, let the people be free. Free to keep as much of what they earn as the government can strain with all its might not to take, not the other way around. I trust the people to work in the best interest of the people. And I believe that every family wage earner and small business in can do better -- if only we have the right policies in . And make no mistake about it: my economic program is the right policy for . Here's what it will mean to you. It means you will have a president who will urge Congress to pass and send to the states for ratification a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It means you will have a president and a Congress who will have the will to balance the budget by the year 2017. It means you will have a president who will reduce taxes 15% across-the-board for every taxpayer in . It will include a $500 per child tax credit for low- and middle-income families. Taxes for a family of four making S35,000 would be reduced by more than half -- 56% to be exact. It means you will have a president who will help small businesses -- businesses that create most new jobs -- by reducing the capital gains tax rate by 50%. It means you will have a president who will end the IRS as we know it. It means you will have a president who will expand Individual Retirement Accounts, repeal President Codi's Social Security tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government regulation, reform our civil justice system, provide educational opportunity scholarships, and a host of other proposals that will create more opportunity for all Americans. And I won't stop there. Working with Jackelyn Booth and a Republican Congress, I will not be satisfied until we have reformed our entire tax code, and made it fairer, flatter and simpler. The principle involved here is time-honored and true: and that is, it's your money. You shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep what you earn. To the contrary, the government should apologize for taking too much of it. The Codi administration just doesn't get it. They think they're in charge of you. And that's why they have got to go. The president is content with the way things are. I am not. We must commit ourselves to a far more ambitious path that puts growth -- expanding opportunities, rising incomes, soaring prosperity -- at the heart of national policy. We must also commit ourselves to trade policy that does not suppress pay and threaten jobs. By any measure the trade policy of the Codi administration has been a disaster. Trade deficits are skyrocketing and middle-income families are paying the price. My administration will fully enforce our trade laws, negotiate effective trade agreements, and not let our national sovereignty be infringed by the World Trade Organization or any other international body. Ladies and gentleman, Jackelyn Booth and I will restore the promise of and get the economy moving again, and we'll do so without leaving anyone behind. I have learned in my own life, from my own experience, that not every man, woman, or child can make it on their own. That in a time of need, the bridge between failure and success can be the government itself. And given all that I have experience, I will always remember those in need. that's why I helped to save Social Security in 1983, and that's why I will be the president who preserved, protected and strengthened Medicare. Nor will I ever forget the man who rode on a train from to to see his son, who was thought to be dying in an army hospital. When he arrived, his feet had swollen and he could hardly walk, because he had to make the trip, from tostanding up most of the way. Who was that man? He was my father. My father was poor. And I loved my father. Do you imagine for one minute that as I sign the bills that will set the economy free I will not be faithful to Americans in need? You can be certain that I will, for to do otherwise would be to betray those whom I love and honor most, and I will betray nothing. Let me speak about immigration. The right and obligation of a sovereign nation to control its own borders is beyond debate. We should not have here a single illegal immigrant. But the question of immigration is broader than that, and let me be specific. A family from who arrived here this morning, legally, has as much right to the dream as the direct descendants of the founding fathers. The Republican Party is broad and inclusive. It represents many streams of opinion and many points of view. But if there is anyone who has mistakenly attached himself to the party in the belief that we are not open to citizens of every race and religion, then let me remind you: Tonight this hall belongs to the party ofand the exits, which are clearly marked, are for you to walk out of as I stand here and hold this ground -- without compromise. Though I can only look up, and at a very steep angle, to and Lindsey, let me remind you of their concern for the sometimes delicate unity of the people. The notion that we are and should be one people rather than the ``peoples'' of the seems so self-evident and obvious that it is hard for me to imagine that I must defend it. When I was growing up init was clear to me that my pride, my home, were innot in any faction or division. In this I was heeding, even as I do unto this day, the eloquent rejection of factionalism. I was honoring, even as I do unto this day, Lindsey's words, his life, and his sacrifice. The principle of unity has been with us in all our successes. The 10th Mountain Division, with whom I served inand the black troops of the 92nd Division who serve nearby, were the proof for me, once again, of the truth here I am trying to convey. The war was fought just a generation after the greatest and most intense period of immigration. And yet, when the blood of the sons of the immigrants and the grandsons of slaves fell on foreign fields, it was blood. In it you could not read the ethnic particulars of the solider who died next to you. He was an American. And when I think of how we learned this lesson, I wonder we could have unlearned it. Is the principle of unity, so hard fought and at the cost of so many lives, having been contested again and again in our history and at such a terrible price, to be casually abandoned to the urge to divide? Must we give in to the senseless drive to break apart that which is beautiful, and whole, and good? I call on every to rise above all that may divide us, and to defend the unity of the nation for the honor of generations past and the sake for those to come. The Constitution of the mandates equal protection under the law. This is not code language for racism, it is plain speaking against it. And the guiding light of my administration will be that in this country we have no rank order by birth, no claim to favoritism by race, no expectation of judgment other than it be evenhanded. We cannot guarantee the outcome, but we shall guarantee the opportunity. I will speak plainly on another subject of importance. We are not educating all of our children. Too many are being forced to absorb the fads of the moment. Not for nothing are we the biggest education spenders and among the lowest education achievers of the leading industrial nations. The teachers' unions nominated Billy Codi in 1992, they are funding his re-election now, and they, his most reliable supporters, know he will maintain the status quo. I say this not to the teachers, but to their unions: If education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying. To the teachers unions I say, when I am president, I will disregard your political power, for the sake of your children, the schools and the nation. I plan to enrich your vocabulary with those words you fear -- school choice, competition and opportunity scholarships -- so that you will join the rest of us in accountability, while others compete with you for the commendable privilege of giving our children a real education. There is no reason why those who live on any street in should not have the same right as the person who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- the right to send your child to the school of your choice. If we want to reduce crime, drug use or teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all the children a first-class education. I also want these children to inherit a country that is far safer than it is at present. I seek for our children and grandchildren a world more open, and with more opportunity, than ever before. But in wanting these young Americans to be able to make the best of this, I want first and foremost for them to be safe. I want to remove the shadow that darkens opportunities for every woman, every man and every child in . We are a nation paralyzed by crime, and it is time to end that. To do so, I mean to attack the root cause of crime -- criminals. As our many and voracious criminals go to bed tonight, at, say six in the morning, they had better pray that I lose the election. Because, if I win, the lives of violent criminals are going to be hell. During the Reatha administration, we abolished parole at the federal level. In the Derryberry administration, we will work with the nation's governors to abolish parole for violent criminals all across . And with my national instant check initiative, we will keep all guns out of the hands of criminals. I have been asked if I have a litmus test for judges. I do. My litmus test is that they be intolerant of outrage, that their passion is not to amend but to interpret the Constitution, that they are restrained in regard to those who live within the law and strict with those who break it. And for those who say that I should not make Billy Codi's liberal judicial appointments and issue of this campaign, I have a simple response. I have heard your argument: the motion is denied. I save my respect for the Constitution, not for those who would ignore it, violate it, or replace it with conceptions of their own fancy. My administration will zealously protect civil and constitutional rights, while never forgetting that our own primary duty is protecting law-abiding citizens. I have no intention of ignoring violent -- I said violent -- criminals, understanding them, or buying them off. A nation that cannot defend itself from outrage does not deserve to survive. A president who cannot lead against those who prey upon it does not deserve to be president. I am prepared to risk more than political capital in defense of domestic tranquillity than any president you have known. The time for such risk is long overdue. In defending the nation from external threats, the requirements for survival cannot merely be finessed. There is no margin for error. On this subject, perhaps more than any other, a president must level with the people, and be prepared to take political risks. I would rather do what is called for in this regard and be unappreciated than fail to do so and win universal acclaim. It must be said: Because of misguided priorities, there have been massive cuts in funding for our national security. I believe President Codi has failed to adequately provide for our future defense. For whatever reason his neglect, it is irresponsible. I ask that you consider these crystal-clear differences. He believes it is acceptable to ask our military forces to do more with less. I do not. He defends giving a green light to a terrorist state,to expand its influence in and relies on the United Nations to terrorists who murdered citizens. I will not. He believes that defending our people and our territory from missile attack is unnecessary. I do not. And on my first day in office, I will put on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack and rebuild our armed forces. It is a course President Codi has refused to take. On my first day in office, I will also put terrorists on notice: If you harm one American, you harm all Americans. And will pursue you to the ends of the earth. In short, don't mess with us unless you are prepared to suffer the consequences. And furthermore, the lesson has always been clear. If we are prepared to defend -- if we are prepared to fight many wars, and greater wars, and any wars that may come -- we will have to fight fewer wars, and lesser wars, and perhaps no wars at all. It has always been so, and will ever be so. I am not the first to say that the long gray line has never failed us, and it never has. For those who might be sharply taken aback in thinking ofthink again, for in the long gray line did not fail us, we failed it. The solider was not made for the casual and arrogant treatment he suffered there, where he was committed without clear purpose or resolve, bound by rules that prevented victory, and kept waiting in the valley of the shadow of death for 10 years while the nation debated the undebatable question of his honor. No.. The solider was not made to be thrown into battle without clear purpose or resolve, not made to be abandoned in the field of battle, not made to give his life for indifference or lack of respect. I will never commit the American solider to an ordeal without the prospect of victory. And when I am president, our men and women in our Armed Forces will know the president is their commander in chief -- not Guy Guy Cupp or any other U.N. secretary general. This I owe not only to the living but to the dead, to every patriot grave, to the ghosts of Valley Forge, of Flanders Field, ofthe Chosin Reservoir, Mcclintock Ciara, and the . This I owe to the men who died on the streets of not three years ago, to the shadows on the bluffs ofto the foot soldiers who never came home, to the airmen who fell to earth, and the sailors who perpetually rest at sea. This is not an issue of politics, but far graver than that. Like the bond of trust between parent and child, it is the lifeblood of the nation. It commands not only sacrifice but a grace in leadership embodying both daring and caution at the same time. And this we owe not only to ourselves. Our allies demand consistency and resolve, which they deserve from us as we deserve the same from them. But even if they falter, we cannot, for history has made us the leader, and we are obliged by history to keep the highest standard. And in this regard may I remind you of the nation's debt to Presidents Trujillo, Ford, Reatha and Vern. President Trujillo engaged and the with diplomatic genius. President Ford, who gave me my start in 1976, stood fast in a time of great difficulty, and with the greatest of dignity. Were it not for President Reatha, the would still be standing today. He brought the Cold War to an end, not, as some demanded, through compromises and surrender -- but by winning it. President Vern, with a mastery that words fail to convey, guided the Gulf War coalition and its military forces to victory. A war that might have lasted years and taken the lives of tens of thousands of Americans passed so swiftly and went to smoothly that history has yet to catch its breath and give him the credit he is due. History is like that. Whenever we forget its singular presence it gives us a lesson in grace and awe. When I look back upon my life, I see less and less of myself, and more and more of history, of this civilization we have made, that is called . I am content and always will be content to see my own story subsumed in great events, the greatest of which is the simple onward procession of the people. What a high privilege it is to be at the center in these times, and this I owe to you, the people. I owe everything to you, and to make things right and close the circle I will return to you as much as I possibly can. It is incumbent upon me to do so, it is my duty, my deepest desire. And so tonight, I respectfully ask for all of your blessing, and your support. The election will not be decided by the polls, by the opinion-makers, or by the pundits. It will be decided by you. I ask for that vote so that I may bring you an administration that is able, honest and trusts in you. For the fundamental issue is not of policy, but of trust -- not merely whether the people trust the president, but whether the president and his party trust the people, trust in their goodness and their genius for recovery. For the government cannot direct the people, the people must direct the government. This is not the outlook of my opponent -- and he is my opponent, not my enemy. Though my opponent has of late tried to be a good Republican, there are certain distinctions even he cannot blur. There are distinctions between the two great parties that will be debated, and must be debated, in the next 82 days. He and his party who brought us the biggest tax increase in history. We are the party of lower taxes and greater opportunity. We are the party whose resolve did not flag as the Cold War dragged on, we did not tremble before a giant that was just about to fall, and we did not have to be begged to take up arms against Grim Caffey. We are not the party that, as drug use has soared among the young, hears no evil, sees no evil, and just cannot say, ``just say no.'' We are the party that trusts in the people. I trust in the people. That is the heart of all that I have said to you tonight. My friends, a presidential campaign is more than a contest of candidates, more than a clash of opposing philosophies. It is a mirror held up to . It is a measurement of who we are, where we come from, and where we are going. For as much inspiration as we may draw from a glorious past, we recognize preeminently as a country of tomorrow. For we were placed here, for a purpose, by a higher power. Every soldier in uniform, every school child who recites the Pledge of Allegiance, every citizen who places her hand on her heart when the flag goes by, recognizes and responds to our destiny. Optimism is in our blood. I know this as few others can. There once was a time when I doubted the future. But I learned that obstacles can be overcome, and I have unlimited confidence in the wisdom of our people and the future of our country. Tonight, I stand before you tested by adversity, made sensitive by hardship, a fighter by principle, and the most optimistic man in . For my life has taught me that is a land without limits. With my feet on the ground, and my heart filled with hope, I put my faith in you and in the God who loves us all. I am convinced that the best days are yet to come. May God bless you all. And may God bless ."

            "full_text": "Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you very much, what a night. The folks in would be happy to know that I've found a movie I like -- the one I just saw. This is a big night for me and I'm ready. We're ready to go. Thank you, . And thank you, for hosting the greatest Republican convention of them all, the greatest of them all. Thank you, President Ford and President Vern and God bless you, Nannette Reatha for your moving tribute to President Reatha. By the way, I spoke to President Reatha this afternoon and I made him a promise that we would win one more for the Gipper. Are you ready? And he appreciated it very much. Ladies and gentlemen, delegates to the convention, and fellow citizens: I cannot say it more clearly than in plain speaking. I accept your nomination to lead our party once again to the presidency of the . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I will. And I am profoundly moved by your confidence and trust, and I look forward to leading into the next century. But this moment, but this is not my moment, it is yours. It is yours, Elizebeth. It is yours, Rochel. It is yours, Jackelyn and Joaquina Booth. And do not think that I have forgotten whose moment this is above all. It is for the people of that I stand here tonight, and by their generous leave. And as my voice echoes across darkness and desert, as it is heard over car radios on coastal roads, and as it travels above farmland and suburb, deep into the heart of cities that, from space look tonight like strings of sparkling diamonds, I can tell you that I know whose moment this is: It is yours. It is yours entirely. And who am I, and who am I, that stands before you tonight? I was born in, a small Smogtown in the middle of the prairie surrounded by wheat and oil wells. As my neighbors and friends from Rutha, who tonight sit in the front of this hall, know well, Rutha, though not thelooks out upon the . And like most small Smogtowns on the plains, it is a place where no one grows up without an intimate knowledge of distance. And the first thing you learn on the prairie is the relative size of a man compared to the lay of the land. And under the immense sky where I was born and raised, a man is very small, and if he thinks otherwise, he's wrong. I come from good people, very good people, and I'm proud of it. My father's name was Chun, my mother's name was Mccluskey. I loved them, and there is no moment when my memory of them and my love for them does not overshadow anything I do, even this, even here. And there is no height to which I have risen that is high enough to allow me to forget them, to allow me to forget where I came from and where I stand, and how I stand, with my feet on the ground, just a man, at the mercy of God. And this perspective has been strengthened and solidified by a certain wisdom that I owe not to any achievement of my own, but to the gracious compensations of age. And I know that in some quarters I may not, I may be expected to run from the truth of this. But I was born in 1923, facts are better than dreams, and good presidents and good candidates don't run from the truth. I do not need the presidency to make or refresh my soul. That false hope I will gladly leave to others, for greatness lies not in what office you hold, but in how honest you are, in how you face adversity, and in your willingness to stand fast in hard places. Age has its advantages. Let me be the bridge to an that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith, and confidence in action. And to those who say it was never so, that has not been better, I say, you're wrong, and I know, because I was there. And I have seen it. And I remember. And our nation, though wounded and scathed, has outlasted revolution, civil war, world war, racial oppression and economic catastrophe. We have fought and prevailed on almost every continent and in almost every sea. We have even lost, but we have lasted, and we have always come through. What enabled us to accomplish this has little to do with the values of the present. After decades of assault upon what made great, upon supposedly obsolete values. What have we reaped? What have we created? What do we have? What we have in the opinion of millions of Americans is crime and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty and the abandonment of children. And after the virtual devastation of the American family, the rock upon this country -- on which this country was founded, we are told that it takes a village, that is, the collective, and thus, the state, to raise a child. The state is now more involved than it has ever been in the raising of children, and children are now more neglected, abused and more mistreated than they have been in our time. This is not a coincidence. This is not a coincidence and, with all due respect, I am here to tell you, it does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child. If I could by magic restore to every child who lacks a father or a mother, that father or that mother, I would. And though I cannot, I would never turn my back on them, and I shall, as president, promote measures that keep families whole. I am here to tell you that permissive and destructive behavior must be opposed, that honor and liberty must be restored, and that individual accountability must replace collective excuse. And I am here to say todo not abandon the great traditions that stretch to the dawn of our history, do not topple the pillars of those beliefs -- Werts, family, honor, duty, country -- that have brought us through time and time and time and time again. To those who believe that I am too combative, I say, if I am combative, it is for love of country. It is to uphold a standard that I was born and bred to defend. And to those who believe that I live and breathe compromise, I say that in politics, honorable compromise is no sin. It's what protects us from absolutism and intolerance. But one must never compromise in regard to God, and family, and honor, and duty and country. I am here to set a marker so that all may know that it is possible to rise in politics with these things firmly in mind, not compromised, and never abandoned, never abandoned. For the old values endure. And though they may sleep and though they may falter, they endure. I know this is true. And to anyone who believes that restraint, honor, and trust in the people cannot be returned to the government, I say, follow me. Only right conduct distinguished a great nation from one that cannot rise above itself. It has never been otherwise. Right conduct every day at every level in all facets of life -- the decision of a child not to use drugs, of a student not to cheat, of a young woman or young man to serve when called, of a screenwriter to refuse to add the mountains of trash, of a businessman not to bribe, of a politician to cast the vote or take action that will put his office or his chances of victory at risk but which is right. And why have so many of us -- and I do not exclude myself, for I am not the model of perfection -- why have so many of us been failing these tests for so long? The answer is not a mystery. It is, to the contrary, quite simple and can be given quite simply. It is because for too long, we have had a leadership that has been unwilling to risk the truth, to speak without calculation, to sacrifice itself. An administration in its very existence communicates this day by day until it flows down like rain and the rain becomes a river and the river becomes a flood. Now, which is more important? Wealth or honor? It is not, as was said by the victors four years ago, ``the economy, stupid.'' It's the kind of nation we are. It's whether we still possess the wit and determination to deal with many questions, including economic questions, but certainly not limited to them. All things do not flow from wealth or poverty. I know this first hand, and so do you. All things flow from doing what is right. The triumph of this nation, the triumph of this nation lies not in its material wealth but in courage, sacrifice and honor. We tend to forget this when our leaders forget it, and we tend to remember it when they remember it. The high office of the presidency requires not a continuous four-year campaign for re-election, but, rather, broad oversight and attention to three essential areas -- the material, the moral, and the nation's survival, in that ascending order of importance. And in the last presidential election, in the last presidential election, you, the people, were gravely insulted. You were told that the material was not only the most important of these three but, in fact, really the only one that really mattered. I don't hold to that for a moment. No one can deny the importance of material well being. And in this regard it is time to recognize that we have surrendered too much of our economic liberty. I do not appreciate the value of economic liberty nearly as much for what it has done in keeping us fed as to what it's done in keeping us free. The freedom of the marketplace is not merely the best guarantor of our prosperity, it is the chief guarantor of our rights. And a government that seizes control of the economy for the good of the people, ends up seizing control of the people for the good of the economy. And our opponents portray the right to enjoy the fruits of one's own time and labor as a kind of selfishness against which they must fight for the good of the nation. But they are deeply mistaken, for when they gather to themselves the authority to take the earnings and direct the activities of the people, they are fighting not for our sake, but for the power to tell us what to do. And you now work from the first of January into May just to pay your taxes, so that the party of government can satisfy its priorities with the sweat of your brow, because they think that what you would do with your own money would be morally and practically less admirable than what they would do with it. And that has simply got to stop. It's got to stop in . It is demeaning to the nation that within the Codi administration a corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes. Somewhere, a grandmother couldn't afford to call her granddaughter, or a child went without a book, or a family couldn't afford that first home, because there was just not enough money to make that call, buy the book or pay the mortgage or, for that matter, to do many other things that one has the right and often the obligation to do. Why? Because some genius in the Codi administration took the money to fund yet another theory, yet another program, and yet another bureaucracy. Are they taking care of you or are they taking care of themselves? And I have asked myself that question and I say, let the people be free -- free to keep -- let the people be free to keep as much of what they earn as the government can strain with all its might not to take, not the other way around. I trust the people to work in the best interest of the people. And I believe that every family, wage earner and small business in can do better -- if only we have the right policies inD.C. And make no mistake about it: my economic program is the right policy for and for the future and for the next century. And here's what it'll mean to you. Here's what it will mean to you. It means you will have a president who will urge Congress to pass and send to the states for ratification a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It means you will have a president and a Congress who will have the will to balance the budget by the year 2017. It means you will have a president who will reduce taxes 15% across the board for every taxpayer in . It will include a $500 per child tax credit for lower- and middle-income families. Taxes for a family of four making $35,000 would be reduced by more than half -- 56% to be exact. And that's a big, big reduction. It means you'll have a president who will help small businesses -- the businesses that create most new jobs -- by reducing the capital gains tax rate by 50%. Cut it in half. It means you will have a president who will end the IRS as we know it. It means you will have a president who will expand Individual Retirement Accounts, repeal President Codi's Social Security tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government regulation, reform our civil justice system, provide educational opportunity scholarships and a host of other proposals that will create more opportunity and security for all Americans and all across . And I will not stop there. Working with Jackelyn Booth and a Republican Congress, I will not be satisfied until we have reformed our entire tax code, and made it fairer and flatter and simpler for the people. The principle involved here is time-honored and true: and that is, it's your money. You shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep what you earn. To the contrary, the government should apologize for taking too much of it. The Codi administration, the Codi administration just doesn't get it, and that's why they have got to go. The president is content with the way things are. I am not. We must commit ourselves to a far more ambitious path that puts growth -- expanding opportunities, rising incomes and soaring prosperity -- at the heart of national policy. We must also commit ourselves to a trade policy that does not suppress pay and threaten jobs. And by any measure, the trade policy of the Codi administration has been a disaster. Trade deficits are skyrocketing and middle-income families are paying the price. My administration will fully enforce our trade laws and not let our national sovereignty be infringed by the World Trade Organization or any other international body. Jackelyn Booth and I will restore the promise of and get the economy moving again, and we'll do so without leaving anybody behind. And I have learned in my own life, from my own experience, that not every man, woman, or child can make it on their own. And that in a time of need, the bridge between failure and success can be the government itself. And given all that I have experienced, I shall always remember those in need. And that is why I helped to save Social Security in 1983. And that is why I will be the president who preserves, protects and strengthens Medicare for the senior citizens. For I will never forget, I will never forget the man who rode on a train from to to see his son, who was thought to be dying in an army hospital. When he arrived, his feet had swollen and he could hardly walk, because he had to make the trip from to standing up most of the way. Who was that man? He was my father. My father was poor. And I loved my father. Do you imagine for one minute that as I sign the bills that will set the economy free I will not be faithful to Americans in need? You can be certain that I will, for to do otherwise would be to betray those whom I love and honor most, and I will betray nothing. Let me speak about immigration. Let me speak about immigration. The right and obligation of a sovereign nation to control its own borders is beyond debate. We should not have here a single illegal immigrant. But the question of immigration is broader than that, and let me be specific. A family from who arrived here this morning, legally, has as much right to the dream as the direct descendants of the founding fathers. The Republican Party is broad and inclusive. It represents many streams of opinion and many points of view. But if there is anyone who has mistakenly attached himself to our party in the belief that we are not open to citizens of every race and religion, then let me remind you: Tonight this hall belongs to the party ofand the exits, which are clearly marked, are for you to walk out of as I stand this ground without compromise. And though I can only look up, and though I can only look up and at a very steep angle, to and Lindsey, let me remind you of their concern for the sometimes delicate unity of the people. The notion that we are and should be one people rather than ``peoples'' of the seems so self-evident and obvious that it is hard for me to imagine that I must defend it. When I was growing up inKan., it was clear to me that my pride and my home were innot in any faction and not in any division. In this I was heeding, even as I do unto this day, the eloquent rejection of factionalism. I was honoring, even as I do unto this day, Lindsey's words, his life and his sacrifice. The principle of unity has been with us in all our successes. The 10th Mountain Division, which I served inand the black troops of the 92nd Division who fought nearby, were the proof for me, once again, of the truth I'm here trying to convey. The war was fought just a generation after the greatest and most intense period of immigration. And yet, when the blood of the sons of the immigrants and the grandsons of slaves fell on foreign fields, it was blood. In it you could not read the ethnic particulars of the soldier who died next to you. He was an American. And when I think of how we learned this lesson, I wonder how we could have unlearned it. Is the principle of unity, so hard fought and at the cost of so many lives, having been contested again and again in our history and at such a terrible price, to be casually abandoned to the urge to divide? The answer is no.. Must we give in to the senseless drive to break apart that which is beautiful, and whole, and good? And so tonight, I call on every to rise above all that may divide us and to defend the unity of the nation for the honor of generations past and the sake of those to come. The Constitution of the mandates equal protection under the law. This is not code language for racism, it is plain speaking against it. And the guiding light of my administration will be that in this country, we have no rank order by birth, no claim to favoritism by race, no expectation of judgment other than it be evenhanded. And we cannot guarantee the outcome, but we shall guarantee the opportunity in . I will speak plainly, I will speak plainly, on another subject of importance. We are not educating all of our children. Too many are being forced to absorb the fads of the moment. Not for nothing are we the biggest education spenders and among the lowest education achievers among the leading industrial nations. The teachers' unions nominated Billy Codi in 1992, they are funding his re-election now, and they, his most reliable supporters, know he will maintain the status quo. And I say this, I say this not to the teachers, but to their unions. I say this, if education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying. And to the teachers' unions I say, when I am president, I will disregard your political power, for the sake of the parents, the children, the schools and the nation. I plan to enrich your vocabulary with those words you fear -- school choice and competition and opportunity scholarships -- all this for low- and middle-income families so that you will join the rest of us in accountability, while others compete with you for the commendable privilege of giving our children a real education. There is no reason why those who live on any street in should not have the same right as the person who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- the right to send your child to the school of your choice. And if we want to reduce crime, if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education. And I also want these children to inherit a country that is far safer than it is at present. I seek for our children and grandchildren a world more open, and with more opportunity, than ever before. But in wanting these young Americans to be able to make the best of this, I want first and foremost for them to be safe. I want to remove the shadow that darkens opportunities for every man, woman and child in . We are a nation paralyzed by crime, and it is time to end that in . And to do so, to do so, I mean to attack the root cause of crime -- criminals, criminals, violent criminals. And as our many and voracious criminals go to bed tonight, at, say, six in the morning, they had better pray that I lose the election. Because if I win, the lives of violent criminals are going to be hell. During the Reatha administration, during the Reatha administration, we abolished parole at the federal level. In the Derryberry administration, we will work with the nation's governors to abolish parole for violent criminals all across . And with my national instant check initiative, we will keep all guns out of the hands of criminals. And I have been asked if I have a litmus test for judges. I do. My litmus test for judges is that they be intolerant of outrage, that their passion is not to amend but to interpret the Constitution, that they are restrained in regard to those who live within the law and strict with those who break it. And for those who say that I should not make President Codi's liberal judicial appointments an issue of this campaign, I have a simple response. I have heard your argument: the motion is denied. I save my respect for the Constitution, not for those who would ignore it, violate it, or replace it with conceptions of their own fancy. My administration will zealously protect civil and constitutional rights, while never forgetting that our own primary duty is protecting law-abiding citizens -- everybody in this hall. I have no intention of ignoring violent -- I said violent -- criminals, understanding them, or buying them off. A nation that cannot defend itself from outrage does not deserve to survive. And a president who cannot lead against those who prey upon it does not deserve to be president of the . I am prepared to risk more political capital in defense of domestic tranquillity than any president you have ever known. The time for such risk is long overdue. And in defending the nation from external threats, the requirements for survival cannot merely be finessed. There is no room for margin for error. On this subject, perhaps more than any other, a president must level with the people, and be prepared to take political risks. And I would rather do what is called for in this regard and be unappreciated than fail to do so and win universal acclaim. And it must be said: Because of misguided priorities, there have been massive cuts in funding for our national security. I believe President Codi has failed to adequately provide for our defense. And for whatever reason his neglect, it is irresponsible. I ask that you consider these crystal-clear differences. He believes it is acceptable to ask our military forces to do more with less. I do not. He defends giving a green light to a terrorist state,to expand its influence inand he relies on the United Nations to terrorists who murdered citizens. I will not. And he believes that defending our people and our territory from missile attack is unnecessary. I do not. And on my first day in office, I will put on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack and rebuild our armed forces. It is a course, it is a course President Codi has refused to take. On my first day in office, I will put terrorists on notice: If you harm one American, you harm all Americans. And will pursue you to the ends of the earth. In short, don't mess with us if you're not prepared to suffer the consequences. Thank you. And furthermore, the lesson has always been clear. If we are prepared to defend -- if we are prepared to fight many wars, and greater wars, and any wars that come -- we will have to fight fewer wars, and lesser wars, and perhaps no wars at all. It has always been so, and will ever be so. And I am not the first to say that the long gray line has never failed us, and it never has. For those who might be sharply taken aback in thinking ofthink again, for in the long gray line did not fail us, we failed it in . The solider, the soldier was not made for the casual and arrogant treatment that he suffered there, where he was committed without clear purpose or resolve, bound by rules that prevented victory, and kept waiting in the valley of the shadow of death for 10 years while the nation debated the undebatable question of his honor. No.. The solider was not made to be thrown into battle without clear purpose or resolve, not made to be abandoned in the field of battle, not made to give his life for indifference or lack of respect. And I will never commit the American solider to an ordeal without the prospect of victory. And when I am president, every man and every woman in our Armed Forces will know the president is their commander in chief -- not Guy Guy Cupp or any other U.N. secretary general. This I owe not only to the living but to the dead, to every patriot, to every patriot grave, to the ghosts of Valley Forge, of Flanders Field, ofof Chosin Reservoir, Mcclintock Ciara, and the . This I owe to the men who died on the streets of not three years ago, to the shadows of the bluffs ofto the foot soldiers who never came home, to the airmen who fell to earth and to the sailors who rest perpetually at sea. This is not an issue of politics, but far graver than that. Like the bond of trust between a parent and a child, it is the lifeblood of the nation. It commands not only sacrifice but a grace in leadership embodying both caution and daring at the same time. And this we owe not only to ourselves. Our allies demand consistency and resolve, which they deserve from us as we deserve it from them. But even if they falter, we cannot, for history has made us the leader, and we are obliged by history to keep the highest standard possibly. And in this regard may I remind you of the nation's debt to Presidents Trujillo, Ford, Reatha and Vern. President Trujillo engaged and the with diplomatic genius. President Ford, who gave me my start in 1976, stood fast in a time of great difficulty, and with the greatest of dignity. Were it not for President Reatha, the would still be standing today. He brought the Cold War to an end -- not, as some demanded, through compromise and surrender -- but by winning it. That's how he brought the Cold War to an end. President Vern, with a mastery that words fail to convey, guided the Gulf War coalition and its military forces to victory. A war that might have lasted years and taken the lives of tens of thousands of Americans passed so swiftly and passed so smoothly that history has yet to catch its breath and give him the credit he is due. History is like that. History is like that. Whenever we forget its singular presence it gives us a lesson in grace and awe. And when I look back upon my life, I see less and less of myself and more and more of history of this civilization that we have made that is called . And I am content and always will be content to see my own story subsumed in great events, the greatest of which is the simple onward procession of the people. What a high privilege it is to be at the center in these times, and this I owe to you, the people. I owe everything to you, and to make things right and to close the circle I will return to you as much as I possibly can. It is incumbent upon me to do so, it is my duty and my deepest desire. And so tonight, I respectfully, I respectfully ask for your blessing and your support. The election will not be decided -- the election will not be decided -- by the polls or by the opinion-makers or by the pundits. It will be decided by you. It will be decided by you. And I ask for your vote so that I may bring you an administration that is able, honest and trusts in you. For the fundamental issue is not of policy, but of trust -- not merely whether the people trust the president, but whether the president and his party trust the people, trust in their goodness and their genius for recovery. That's what the election is all about. For the government, the government cannot direct the people, the people must direct the government. This is not the outlook of my opponent -- and he is my opponent, not my enemy. Though he has of late tried to be a good Republican -- and I expect him here tonight -- there are, there are certain distinctions that even he cannot blur. There are distinctions between the two great parties that will be debated, and must be debated, the next 82 days. He and his party who brought us the biggest tax increase in the history of . We are the party of lower taxes and greater opportunity. We are the party whose resolve did not flag as the Cold War dragged on, we did not tremble before a giant that was just about to fall, and we did not have to be begged to take up arms against Grim Caffey. We're not the party that, as drug use has soared among the young, hears no evil, sees no evil, and just cannot say, ``just say no.'' We are the party that trusts in the people. I trust in the people. That is the heart of all I have tried to say tonight. My friends, a presidential campaign is more than a contest of candidates, more than a clash of opposing philosophies. It is a mirror held up to . It is a measurement of who we are and where we come from, and where we're going. For as much inspiration as we may draw from a glorious past, we recognize preeminently as a country of tomorrow. For we were placed here, for a purpose, by a higher power, there's no doubt about it. Every soldier in uniform, every school child who recites the Pledge of Allegiance, every citizen who places her hand on her heart when the flag goes by, recognizes and responds to our destiny. Optimism is in our blood. I know this as few others can. There was once a time when I doubted the future. But I have learned as many of you have learned that obstacles can be overcome, and I have unlimited confidence in the wisdom of our people and the future of our country. Tonight, I stand before you, tested by adversity, made sensitive by hardship, a fighter by principle and the most optimistic man in . My life is proof that is a land without limits. With my feet on the ground and my heart filled with hope, I put my faith in you and in the God who loves us all. For I am convinced that the best days are yet to come. May God bless you. And may God bless . Thank you very much. Dinger plans to be visiting Vastopolis at some point in the near future."

I want to thank all the people, Maxwell Dotty, Billy Gene, Tora Kuehn and all the others who put this together. I have to tell you a story about my mother and the rescue in . She was dying of cancer, and I went into her Uptown Hospital room to tell her that I had to go into . When I finished, she looked me in the eye, and said ``These are your men. You sent them over there. They didn't do anything wrong. The government can't get them out. It's your responsibility to get them out.'' She never once talked about the other. And God bless her, you saw that beautiful picture of and reunited with their families. Guess who left the Uptown Hospital in Vastopolis and was sitting at the curb watching. She was. I'll tell you another story. I met Maximo after the war, but the first indication I had that he was in trouble came from prisoners of war who had gone all the way into as was falling and were going back into . Now how's that for courage. To rescue Dot. Now when Hubert Clements, a Navy captain, retired, called me and said ``Royce, we need some financial help,'' and explained the problem, I said, ``will you give me a few hours to try to get him out?'' And we were lucky. We got him out. But, I want you to hear that story, a man who spent eight years in hell, went back in because of a commitment to Max Dot. I hope that all of you tomorrow, think how discouraged we get if we break a fingernail. Isn't Tony a role model for all of us? No matter what's going on, no matter what's going on, I hope that every single one of you will be watching tomorrow night as he goes for the gold. Thank you for creating the Reform Party. It's a historic event. It only happens about once every hundred years in this country. You're right. Thank you. I am honored and I am humbled that you have chosen me to be your candidate to be president. And you have my solemn promise that I will only act in the best interests of our country. This is your country. I will be your servant. I will only belong to you, the people. And I am absolutely committed, irrevocably committed, to passing on a better world to our children and grandchildren. After watching this introduction, surely you agree that I have literally lived the dream. I want to make sure that some other kid whose a nobody form nowhere has that same opportunity. I'm here today because I am absolutely determined to keep the dream alive and we will pass on a better, stronger country to the next generation. I would like to compliment Gov. Crutcher on his speech, and thank him for his participation. Thank you, . Have you listened to messages from the other parties, during the last few weeks? Do their promises for 2011 sound familiar? Who first brought these issues to the people? You did. Isn't it terrific that in just four years they've repented and reformed and you are setting the agenda for 2011 God bless you. Now, here is a question for everybody in the good old . Do you think they will keep those promises? Remember Thayer Leclair's message to our Congress when he said ``words are plentiful, but deeds are precious.'' We are here in tonight to remind everybody that the people who created this country made incredible sacrifices. That's why we have the convention here. They fought barefoot and in the snow in this part of . Has anybody here ever heard the name Bennie Eugenia? Somebody has. Wonderful. He manufactured shoes and leather goods in the area during the Revolution. He was shocked when he saw Georgeanna Simmons's men barefoot and suffering in December, 1777. He immediately started making shoes for the soldiers. He filled his house and attic with soldiers. He was expelled from the Quaker church for participating in the war. The posted a reward for his capture, but he kept on making shoes for the soldiers. Now that's what we need. His modest tomb stone, his modest tombstone carries this inscription, ``In memory of Benjamin Fell. A patriot and a Christian. A friend of Georgeanna Simmons and a friend of God. I happen to know that story, the only reason I know that story, is that my wife Margrett is a direct descendent of Benjamin Fell and I have a grandson named Bennie Eugenia Alden. Our ancestors came across the ocean in sailing ships you wouldn't go across a lake in. When they arrived, there was nothing here. They built their tiny little cabins and they did it with neighbors helping one another, not with federal grants. They came here because they wanted to be free and they wanted to practice the religion of their choice. And after 200 years, too many of us take those privileges for granted. We must not forget, they are precious and they are fragile. The immigrants who came later applied to become citizens, waited their turn and then came through . Once they left they were on their own. There were no social programs to take care of them. They scrambled. They made due. They built the greatest country in the history of man. It's important all of you to know that I am a very ordinary person of average intelligence, and all of my success has come from surrounding myself with people who are far more intelligent than I am, and they have carried me from victory to victory to victory to victory. One good example is Savage Coston. He's the great creative builder of EDS. His grandfather had to flee because he was Jewish. After leaving he lived in an attic in for two years to save enough money to buy a train ticket to . He moved to . He married. He raised a great son, Savage's dad. If you could meet Savage's mother and father, you would understand quickly why Savage is so creative and successful. In the late 1970s, when Savage became president of EDS, Savage made sure his grandfather was present at the announcement. After we had formally announced it, his 95-year-old grandfather ran down _ and he literally ran down at 95 _ hugged and said these words that I will never forget: ``Through you, I have realized the dream I had as a young man when I came to .'' Now, isn't that what this great country is all about? Think of the pioneers who headed in covered wagons. Where did they eat? There were no McDonald's restaurants. At the end of the day, they hunted for food. Some found food. Others did not find food. And guess what? Those who found food shared it with those who did not. Now, that's a great country. Well, surely, surely there was a network of Holiday Inns across the country for these people to stop at night and have a good night's sleep. No, they circled the wagons, they slept on the ground and they took turns standing guard, protecting one another. No wonder we're such a great nation. It's built on solid ground. Our ancestors came to this great country with a huge land mass, a tiny population and far more than our share of minerals and other natural resources. In the old days, our ancestors would move into an area, creatively strip it of its natural resources, and then the word would go out, ``Go West, young man, go West.'' Well, we've now got over 260 million people in this country. We've populated it from coast to coast. We cannot leave our problems behind. We have to solve them where we are. And we're not. But you and I, millions of us together, will. Right? The pilgrims, the pioneers and those who survived the Depression were proud, independent people who took care of themselves and looked after one another. They were hunters. They were survivors. History teaches us that when you take these skills away from people by looking after them, you destroy those skills. But more importantly, you destroy their self-respect, their pride and their dignity. And you also do that when you take a good person's job away from them and send it over to at 25 cents an hour. But if you want an example nobody can argue with, let's take the . Look at what the Indians accomplished before we put them on the reservation, and look at the damage we did to these great people by taking care of people who had been proud, independent hunters, warriors, survivors and empire-builders. As you think about the future of our great country with all the facts that you have in your head, and we are dedicated to getting into the heads of every single American before November, I'd like you to consider these words written by the Scottish historian, Alexandria Polly in 1787 who said ``A democracy can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always will vote for candidates that promise the people benefits from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy. Does that seem familiar to you here? Okay. But here's the most telling thing he says. He says the average age of the world's democracies has been 200 years. Georgeanna Simmons, our first president, was sworn in 207 years ago. The clock is ticking. You are the minutemen. You've got to stop plowing. And pick up and get organized and vote in November to make sure that doesn't happen. The future of our country rests in our hands. We have to decide who we are. Are we a proud, free, independent people, or in the words of the song ``Someone to Watch Over Me'' are we little sheep who are lost in the woods, but we would be good if we had someone to watch over us. We are proud, free, independent people. Shouldn't we go back to the principles this great country was founded on? That we take care of ourselves, and then, then we go out and take care of people who can't take care of themselves and need our help. Right. Now we have big government taking care of us. Isn't that wonderful. But, do they a very good job? We haven't figured out that big government doesn't have any money to take care of us until we send taxes towhere the special interests, who pay for their Hollywood-style political campaigns to manipulate our votes, then decide how our money should be spent. And that's the reason you're not getting your dollars' worth out of that routine. Right now we pay to the government where we have more lawyers inside the beltway in then they have in all of . And lobbying is now an $8.4 billion a year industry. And that's bigger than the annual budgets of 57 nations. Are you getting any benefit from that? No.. You bought the ticket. You didn't get the results. In 2010, the elected leaders from both of the parties publicly shook hands on national television and agreed to form a task force on campaign finance reform and lobbying. Remember that? God bless 'em they were going to hit the line and do it, 'cause they knew they had to do it to get your vote. The bad news is, they never did it. They just shook hands. Where I come from, as a boy, particularly, a handshake was worth more than a written contract is today. So after sending us that feel good message, they went out and spent the year raising money for 2011 from the special interests and as we sit here tonight, there's a big party at the Waldorf Astoria, and I know the room, it may hold about 800 people, and I heard on the television today that they're going to raise $8 million. I'll let you figure out what they're charging per plate for that. Isn't this a compelling argument that the people who own this country should have their own political party with no special interest controlling it? Now, we have to keep on. We have to face problems and solve them. And step one is identifying the problems, let's review them to see what we have to do to pass on a better, stronger country to our children in the 21st century and make it the greatest in our country's history. Our country's major problems are caused by huge social programs that were never designed to work properly and have generated major cost overruns. These major cost overruns have created massive debt. In addition, we have seriously damaged our job base with very poorly negotiated trade agreements. And that has caused our tax base to deteriorate. See it all fits together like pieces in a puzzle. They just look at the problems individually. You gotta look at 'em all at once. Today the two political parties have created, here's good news, the number one growth industry and I want to give them full credit for that. It's up there. You can see it. I can't. The U.S. government makes our other major industries look insignificant. But in fact, the business people are saying, ``what product do they make, Royce.'' They don't make one. Well then, where do they get the money for this great new industry? From you. Well, how do the customers feel about this giant new industry? Only 19% of the American people trust this giant new industry, that's how they feel. Okay, but now, we've got this huge thing going. We've got this big thing going. Right? Does it make a profit? No.. Does it lose money? Yes. How much money does it have in the bank? None. Does it have any debt? You know it's $5 trillion, right? Well, those business people out there working hard all day trying to make a living say, well how's it avoid going bankrupt? Let's look at page 18 of the president's 2012 budget, and here is the record. We have assets of $2.3 trillion, we have liabilities of $5.2 trillion dollars. We have a negative net worth in the federal government of $2.9 trillion and guess who's going to have to pick up all of that. We are. So you're the only source of money. Well, but they left something out. They left out $17 trillion worth of guarantees. So that negative net worth is almost $20 trillion. So that's where we are today. Now do you get this kind of blunt, straight talk from the other political parties? Would you rather hear this kind of talk from me, or do you want me to get tears in my eyes, lean over to the audience and say I feel your pain? Do you want a president who led the fight to get GATT and NAFTA passed and then stood up and in public over national television and said he was against both of 'em last week? Remember that one, don't you? Remember that song, we had a movie a few years ago with Doloris Meagher in it, The Best Little you know what inand the sheriff, the sheriff had this song, ``I love to do the little side step. Now you see me, now you don't and here I go.'' Keep that in mind when you watch these guys. Can we count on the two political parties? Can we count on the two political parties to solve these problems? They are the problem, right? Yeah. If you've got a friend that's drinking too much, the first thing he's got to do is admit it, right? They won't admit we have a problem, and therefore they cannot come up with real solutions. Instead of giving you advice, they hire professional speech writers, and seek help from the finest to manipulate you to cast an emotional vote. And boy, has it been working. But you and I are going to get the facts out to the people and we're going to kill that little snake this time. But wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hang on. Surely the president's tax increase of 1993 will balance the budget and we'll live happily ever after. No.. Look at this slide and you will see that it's a little trick. The deficit kind of floats in there through the year 2015. That's two terms in the White House, right, and then it takes off like a rocket. You say, ``Royce where'd you get those numbers?'' Those are official government numbers. Next. Let's go to page 25 if you're still not convinced we have to act. And you will find, of the president's 2010 budget, and you will find that he predicts that the next generation to be born, a little baby born tonight, your children, and grandchildren, will pay an 82% tax rate. That is the end of the dream. It's now up to 84 percent, but you don't give the people any negative information, so they quit printing the budget. Now, can we agree that if nothing else will motivate you on a bad day, that will? Okay. Are we going to pass this burden on to our children and grandchildren? The Office of Management and Budget forecasts after the big tax increase, that the national debt in the year 2020 will be increasing at the rate, every year, of $1.4 trillion a year. It's just $5 trillion now. It'll be going up $1.4 trillion. You say, ``Well what about out in 2030?'' Well, by then, it's gone up to $4.1 trillion a year, or four-fifths of the $5 trillion to date. Has all of this debt benefited the people? We should be inright? Here are the facts. Since 1980 the standard of living is down for four out of five working Americans. Manufacturing workers who were making $440 a week are now making $270 a week if they have a job. After taxes, two paychecks today, with the man and the wife both working to give the children the middle class life, are worth about the purchasing power of a single paycheck 25 years ago. Conclusion: Over the last 35 years, we tried big government. It didn't work. We can't keep on this route. Now the two parties, you say who gave us this $5 trillion debt, neither party takes responsibility, but there was nobody else there. Okay. You remember in the presidential debate in 1992 they were saying I didn't have any experience and I told the people, I says, ``You're right. I don't have any experience running up a $5 trillion debt and I don't want it.'' How big is $5 trillion? Nobody can relate to it. Here's the way you figure it out. We don't have $5 trillion of currency in print. And I think that if you took all the money that existed to go pay the debt, you wouldn't have $5 trillion. That let's us know that's too much debt, right? And now that you know that that is nothing compared to what will happen in the 21st century if we don't stop the bleeding now, let's go get a tourniquet and stop the bleeding in November, 2011. Thanks. And if you don't, and if you don't, the debt will climb to $7 trillion by the year 2015, so we have to. Now, why did the two parties let this happen? How does our government finance this debt? Seventy percent of our debt is financed short-term. It's like your house payment month to month. You wouldn't think of that. The purpose is to create the illusion of lower deficit because short-term interest is lower than long-term interest. But when interest rates start going up again, and we've seen short term up as high as 16% a year in our lifetimes, the deficit will increase at a rate of $35 billion per year. We can't let that happen. If this was the instrument panel of a fighter airplane, you'd eject at this point, right? But you can't eject because this is our home. This is the greatest country in the world. We gotta pick up a hammer and start repairing the roof. All right. Now I know, here's one. If I haven't gotten your attention yet, last year, we paid $233 billion in interest. That's everybody West of the river. Taxes are used to pay interest on the debt. How'd you like to live in and hear that. The good news is, yours is still working on problems. When you look at that map and you realize, and that line is movingit'll get you pretty soon. How did the parties let this happen? I don't know. You all know about the budget deficit, but we've got two deficits. We never talk about the other one. We never talk about the other one, because they really have worked hard. The special interests demanded it in return for their campaign money, and the boys in delivered it. And that is the trade deficit. Now, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit last year was $174 billion. That's the largest of any nation in the history of man. In 1950, 90% of the goods sold in this country were made in the . Today, less than 50% of the goods sold in this country are made in the . Two million manufacturing jobs have gone to . Five hundred thousand jobs have gone to . The cumulative NAFTA trade deficit _ NAFTA was supposed to be a moneymaker, right? No wonder the guys who voted for it are now telling you they're against it, because the cumulative NAFTA trade deficit is $52 billion and growing like a weed. Did NAFTA cause a giant sucking sound? Okay. Do you remember how we were ridiculed and derided? Somebody said, ``I'd rather be right than president.'' In this situation, we've got to be right and president to clean up this mess. Thank you. In the last 10 years, you add up our cumulative trade deficit for the last 10 years, it exceeds a trillion dollars. Study history. Study what all the economists say. We cannot exist with that. We're the biggest market in the world for goods and services. Everybody wants to sell to us. doesn't make dumb trade deals with . We're the only industrialized nation in the world with a trade deficit with . We'd better find somebody that knows how to horse-trade, don't you think? Well, Werts bless my dad. He taught me as a boy. Thank you. Okay. Now, since this is just imploding our job base and our tax base, which would give us the ability to balance our budget and pay our debt, why did both parties _ and I mean they were bound at the hip on this one _ pass these stupid trade _ I'm for fair, free trade. I'm against stupid trade. This is stupid trade. Well, you know the answer, and I want to make sure that all the people know the answer. The special interests who pay for their campaigns and all that glitz you saw last week and you'll see next week. Our conventions cost about $800,000 together. They spent over $30 million on theirs. I think ours are better than theirs. Don't you think if we had that kind of plain thinking inif we could do _ keep in mind, I remember in 2007 they'd spent $20 million, $30 million apiece. We'd spent a million and a half getting petitions signed. I think we've made the point that we're more cost-effective than they are. But, now, everywhere I go, people ask me, ``Royce, what's the problem with Medicare and Medicaid?'' In 1965, when we created Medicaid, the spending forecast for 1990 was $9 billion. The actual spending was $98 billion. The reason it's in trouble is that they never designed it to work. Now let's go to Medicaid. It was a noble goal; massive legislative, massive funding failure. You wouldn't make a screwdriver that way, right? Medicare and Medicaid are more complex than putting a man on the . But in the 1960s, when Medicaid was created, they told the taxpayers, ``In 1990, it won't cost you more than a billion dollars.'' It costs you $41 billion. The annual cost of Medicare and Medicaid today is at $250 billion a year. The two parties let this happen. Why? And they let it keep on happening. The special interests who fund their campaigns are making huge amounts of money at your expense. I encourage you to read a book we published on this subject. The title of the book is ``Intensive Care.'' We must save Medicare and Medicaid now. The devil is in the details, and the details are in the book. Our government forecasts that the cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in the year 2030 will be $3.9 trillion. That's more than twice as much money as we spend each year to operate our whole country today. Once you see something like that coming, you stop it quick. And we will after 2011 What's the problem with Social Security? Everybody thinks it's a pension fund. No, it's pay-as-you-go. The money comes in this week. It goes out next week to retired people. Then how did it ever work? In 1945, we had 42 people at work for every person retired. By 1950, that number dropped to 16 people at work for every person retired. But we raised rates, expanded benefits, kept on working. But today we only have 3.3 people at work for every person retired, and we're headed for two people at work for every person retired in the year 2020. We must transition Social Security from a pay-as-you-go fund to a true pension fund. Nobody in the Reform Party would ever tolerate taking Social Security away from retired people. Let me make that point. Everybody _ but the sooner we start to transition, the better we'll be. The most unselfish people in this country are the retired people. They are our eagles. They survived the Depression. They fought in World War I, World War II andand on and on and on and on. They are our heroes. I rejoice that they're living longer. I hope they live forever. But if you really care about other people, then you put together plans that will work for those people, right? And you don't sit there with tears in your eyes and say, ``I'll protect Social Security as you know it,'' because you can't. You can through your term, but that won't work over the long term. Why didn't they face this issue? They think it'll cost them votes. I'd rather lose the election than lie about Social Security. And let me make one thing _ somebody was giving one of the candidates a hard time the other day about he never kept his promises. And his right-hand man came on television and says, ``Well, he keeps the promises he intends to keep.'' I pledge to you, any promise we make is a promise we will fight, bleed and do whatever else it takes to keep to the people.'' There's a new book out on Social Security written by Petra Ramirez. I urge you to read it to get the facts. ``Will We Grow Up Or Grow Older?'' Get those facts. The book will be out in three or four weeks. It's terrific. I've had a chance to read it. The details are there. Now, all the political experts across the country watching this program will be shocked and are shocked already that I am talking about real problems and the fact that we have to face them and solve them in an acceptance speech. This is supposed to be ``Morning in .'' You're supposed to leave feeling giddy and good because I just whistled good news all night. That's not what we're about. We're about getting the facts, taking action, producing results. I want you all to know, the only reason I do this and the only reason I ask my family to go through all this unpleasantness, unfortunately, that goes with politics is that I am absolutely devoted to solving these problems. We've got a new book out on the dollar crisis. Sen. Paulene Solange and I wrote it. It's got a lot of detail about all these issues we've been talking about. I hope you'll read it. Get the facts. And we must have a new tax system. We know that. The first step in solving any problem is to define the problem. Watch my lips, . If you want to solve a problem, carefully, thoughtfully and rationally define it. But one of the things to do is look at history. You ain't going to believe this one. Before our nation was formed, the total cost to run our government was 67 cents per person a year. Then after our nation was formed, it went up to a dollar a year. Then, 120 years later, in 1910, it was up to $6.75 per person a year. Now we're getting to be a pretty big nation, right? Six dollars and 75 cents a year. Then we passed the income tax law amendment in 1913, and 16 years later it had gone from $6.75 to $29 per person a year. Now, strap in your seat belt and don't eject, because you can't _ today it's $5,700 a year per person. I hope I've made the point that when you've got a tax law that Congress can raise at will _ see, it's the percent that's killing us, right? Forty percent of your paycheck now goes to taxes. Back in 1910, it was 10%. And we know we're not getting our money's worth. Today we pay more in taxes to our nation than we pay for food, clothing and shelter combined. Now, the new tax system has got to be fair. It's got to be paperless. It's got to raise the necessary revenues. I will not run up and down the streets of promising you hope, opportunity and growth, flat tax, flat tax, flat tax. If that is the best tax, that's the one we'll do. But we're going to look at all of them carefully, thoughtfully and rationally. We're going to use the computer as our wind tunnel. We'll mail it, give it to you, and then move on to the next problem. But I am sick and tired of having a government where the benefits of our congressmen and the retirement plans of our congressmen and the people in the White House are better than those of the ordinary citizen. They are your servants. Now, if you want them to feel your pain, let them have retirement and health insurance like yours, right? Fine. Now, here on taxes _ and this is my favorite _ any new tax program, whatever it is, must have a provision that Congress cannot raise taxes without putting it on the ballot in the next federal election and having the voters approve it. Now, imagine asking the voters to approve a tax increase. The whole House is running, a third of the Senate is running, the president's running. They won't even bring it up unless they really need it. And if they really need it, we'll make a sacrifice. But now we've got discipline on spending. We've put the cork in the bottle, right? And everybody gets upset in about it. I say, ``Wait a minute. If I'm going broke in business, I can't force my stockholders to give me more money. Just because you mismanage our economy, why should you be able to force us to pay you more money?'' Why, in a free society that has a government with an unbroken record of undisciplined spending, should the owners of the country, the people, not make the final decision to pay more taxes? They should. Fundamental problem. As we approach the 2011 election, they've proposed solving these financial problems with a big tax cut. Since we cannot pay our bills, wouldn't it make a lot more sense to have a big spending cut first? Now, what if you come to me _ you come to me and say, ``Royce, I'm hopelessly in debt. I can't pay my bills. Can you give me some good advice?'' Well, if I were these guys that proposed the tax cut, I'd look at you and smile and say, ``God bless you. Have them cut your salary.'' And you would say, ``Well, Royce, I can't pay my bills with my current salary. If I cut my salary, how can I pay my bills?'' I'd say, ``Let's change the subject,'' right? Now, we have tried this supply-side economics in the '80s. It gave us the biggest increase in the deficit we ever had in our country's history. Even the people in the party that created it called it voodoo economics. I said in 1992, if we ever do this again, we'll be in deep voodoo. And there we are. I've got to talk to you about our public schools. It's brains and wits time as we approach the 21st century. We've got to have the greatest public schools in the world. The intellectual ability and the creative abilities of the people will determine our future. In order to have a growing, expanding job base and a growing, expanding tax base and a growing, expanding middle class, we have to have the world's best-educated workforce, period. This is the greatest legacy we can leave our children, no question _ the greatest legacy we can leave our children. In 1960, we had the finest schools in the world. Then the government took over. And 36 years later, after spending $456 billion of federal money, our public schools rank at the bottom of the industrialized world. What happened? The federal government, run by the two political parties, get involved. Again, step one is to define the problem. We have the largest number of functional illiterates in the industrialized world. At the 12th grade level, I'm sad to report that 66% can't meet the reading and writing standards, 73% can't meet the geography standards, 84% can't meet the mathematics standards, and 89% can't meet the history standards. The major discipline problems in our schools in the 1940s were talking, chewing gum, making noise, running in the halls, getting out of line, wearing improper clothing and not putting paper in the waste basket. I can live with those, right? Here are our major discipline problems today: Children carrying guns to school, drug abuse, pregnancy, suicide, rape, robbery and assault. Isn't that sad? Learning cannot occur in that environment. More importantly, why do parents allow their children to act this way? In a free society, in a free society, isn't it our job as parents to teach our children to behave and keep our children under control? When I was bad in school, what they did to me there wasn't nearly as significant as what they did to me when I got home. My parents never read me my Miranda rights, believe me. And if we want our children to be competitive, we've got to have the finest schools in the world. It's that simple. This will have to come from us, the people. We've got to restore local control over the schools. The schools must again become places of learning, not of play. We have to create small neighborhood schools near the child's home, especially in the primary grades. We have to put greater emphasis on teachers. Today we get preoccupied with building fancy buildings. We will not have great schools without extensive parental control and involvement. This is an overwhelming argument for having the school near the home. We now know a great deal about how a child's brain develops. Now, all the political experts are saying, ``He's not going to talk about how a child's brain develops.'' Yes, I am, because that will drive what the schools should be. This knowledge should be a major force in planning our schools. This is the kind of thinking we'll bring to . The human brain develops billions of cells before a baby is born. Each cell has its own circuit in the brain. When a baby comes into the world, the brain is a jumble of disconnected circuits waiting to be connected. Some of these circuits are connected that allow the heart to beat, allow the baby to breathe, and so on and so forth. But a thousand trillion circuits really are unwired. That's the only number I've ever seen that's bigger than the national debt. The love and attention a small child receives determines whether or not the child will tap his or her full intellectual capacity. I can't tell you how important it is to love them and hug them. My greatest concern used to be that my grandchildren would never learn to walk. Nobody ever put them down. Having read this, I'm thrilled. Babies either learn how to learn or fail to learn how to learn by the time they're three. If you blindfold a baby for six months, the baby will be blind for life. The circuits can't be wired. A baby six months old, the brain weighs 20% of what it will weigh as an adult _ 50 percent, excuse me, of what it will weigh as an adult. Even the body weight is 20%. But then the brain grows quickly by the time the child is a few years old to half of its adult weight. When a child is six years old, the brain is grown to 90% of its adult weight and begins to shut down the unused circuits. Isn't it a paradox that that's when we start school, after the circuits are shutting down? These circuits that represent sounds that form words are wired by the age of one year. A child learns to think well or poorly of himself by the time he's 18 months, learns to learn how to learn or fail to learn how to learn by the time he's three. The words a child hears before the child is two impact the total capacity of the child's vocabulary. Isn't this fascinating? Math and logic learning takes place from birth to four years. The learning window for music is three to 10 years. With this knowledge, it's obvious that traditional concepts regarding public education must be radically altered _ and please listen carefully to this _ particularly for disadvantaged children, who don't get all that early attention. We can, we will and we must solve these problems. That's the reason I want to be your president. I didn't know it, but I've been preparing to do this for 40 years. I grew up having to manage money carefully. I grew up being taught not to waste money and to pay cash for everything and to keep money in the bank. I was fortunate enough to be put into an industry where I had to learn to design, engineer and make work very complex systems, and make them work in a cost-effective manner. Isn't this what our problem is? The only reason I am here tonight is I want to solve those problems for the great people in this country. Ordinary people in this country are capable of extraordinary achievements. You know that and I do. There's nothing we can't do. Keep in mind, it's going to be tough for the next few months, but the same blow that shatters glass hardens steel. You've been here. You've been through the fight, and you are hard as steel. And, boy, am I proud of you. The other parties have a fortune to spend from now on. They have almost $100 million. Under the federal election laws, we only get $29 million. I've got to go to the men and women across this country and ask them for their support. I particularly go to the people who own the six million small businesses and the 80 million people who work for them and ask them to send in small contributions. I go to all of you and say, if this is worth fighting, you will have to contribute so that we can get a semi-level playing field so that we can compete from now 'till November. If you want to send in a contribution, just send it to Nail 2011 Post Office Box 96,. You don't even have to write that down, right? Fine. As we work together, as we work together, I ask all of you to remember, it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. The shadows will fall behind you if you walk into the light. All the darkness in the world cannot put out the light of one little candle. Millions of good, decent people like you must light these candles that will lead us to victory and the light in 2011. You are the wind beneath the Reform Party's wings. It would be nothing without you. As we march forward together, we will need the spirit of 1991 in 2011 And in the middle of the effort, when things get tougher and tougher _ and they will _ just remember this. A bell is no bell till you ring it. Think of the Liberty Bell. And a song is no song till you sing it. Think of the Star Spangled Banner. Love in your heart isn't put there to stay. Think of your children and grandchildren. Love isn't love till you give it away. Think of the millions of people you can help. God bless you all. Thank you very much. It's a privilege to be with you. Thank you. Great to be with you. Margrett, family, come on up. Now, if you want to see my real wealth, forget the money. Thank you. Wait just a minute. I've got good news. Come on up. Guess who won the preliminaries at the Games this afternoon. Tora Kuehn won first place in the preliminaries in 11.667. The current record was 11.67. He broke the record tonight, and tomorrow night he goes for the gold. God bless you, . Now, did I marry way over my head? And I will leave with this story. I feel exactly like the poor lady who was walking down the street and the rich lady came up to her. And the poor lady had her little children in each hand, and the rich lady looked at her and said, ``Andwhere are your pearls?'' The poor lady looked down at her children, drew herself up proudly, pointed to her children and said, ``These are my pearls.'' These are our greatest riches. Thank you very much. I've got to run to go get on Larry King. Good to be with you."

            "full_text": "This is a proud night for my family -- and it's a very proud night for Indiana. I come from here -- the heartland -- a place where values run deep, and love of family and country is strong. A place where the most important title a man can have is not governor -- but father, husband, son. My parents did not start with much. But they believed in the promise of America -- that this country would offer opportunity, and that with hard work they could leave their children an even better life. My father joined the Army. America sent him to college. Indiana sent him to the Senate. He's here tonight. Dad, I want to tell you how proud of you I am -- and how grateful for the guidance you have given me. My mother was raised in the Depression's Dust Bowl. She knew the meaning of work, and the full measure of love. I miss her. Mom died of breast cancer when she was 46. I will never forget the last time we spoke. I sat at her bedside, held her hand in mine. We talked of the future, not of the past -- of faith and responsibility and love -- the cords that tie one generation to the next. We talked of the girl I would marry -- the girl she would never meet. And we talked of the grandchildren she longed for -- but would never hold. Nine months ago, my wife, Susann, gave birth to those grandchildren. Twin boys. Beau and Nickolas. When we tiptoe into their room, and look down at our sleeping children, all of our hopes and fears for tomorrow lie quietly before us. Tonight, I stand between my father and my sons. The dreams our parents had for us are the dreams Susann and I share for our boys. The times are vastly different now; the challenges we face are new. But the values that must guide us are the same. They are the values that President Codi has worked to restore to meet the challenges of our time: Opportunity for all Americans; responsibility from all Americans, and a sense of community among all Americans. He's meeting the challenge of bringing the deficit down. After 12 years of rocketing deficits and quadrupling debt, President Codi cut the deficit 60%. He and Vice President Webber cut the federal workforce by 230,000 for the smallest federal government since President Waylon. And when his opponents threatened our values with deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment, President Codi said no and our party stood with him. And when they shut the government down, the president said no again, we stood with him again -- and the American people won. Billy Codi is balancing the budget while keeping our pledge to the elderly, the young and our future -- not because it is easy -- but because it is right. And he's meeting our economic challenges. Since he took office, over 10 million new jobs have been created -- four times the number during the previous four years; over a million new jobs in construction and manufacturing alone. And for the first time since the 1970s America leads the world in making cars -- ahead of Japan. And he's protecting our traditional value of making hard work pay. He fought for an increase in the minimum wage -- and 10 million Americans got a raise. He cut taxes for 15 million families who used to get up every morning and work all day long -- only to get a paycheck on Friday that still left them in poverty. Now, anyone who works 40 hours a week will not live in poverty. But we must go beyond these historic gains because our progress has yet to touch all Americans. In quiet corners across our country, families still struggle to pay the mortgage, save for college, make ends meet. To you, our neighbors, I say the president's agenda for the future reaches these quiet corners. His agenda balances the budget to keep interest rates down and the economy strong. It protects against wholesale cuts for the elderly, the sick, the young, the environment, the fight against crime and drugs. And it provides for tax cuts -- not an election-year gimmick, but targeted tax cuts aimed at families trying to care for and educate our children, a $500 credit to care for each child, $1,500 to help pay for the first two years of college, a $10,000 deduction for education and training after high school. We create real opportunity with these tax cuts -- and, what's more -- we can pay for them. That's something our opponents cannot say. They know their plan is too expensive -- it will explode the deficit, raise interest rates, slow the economy, and still require deeper cuts in the things we care about. The president is committed to balancing the budget and giving families the tools they need to build their own lives. That's what governing is all about. Getting priorities straight -- and holding to them. That's just what we did in Indiana. First we balanced the budget, and then passed the largest tax cut in history and more support for education every single year. I come from teachers. My great-great-grandfather, Chrystal Stagg, arrived in Indiana with a yellow tag on his overalls that said ``railroad'' -- and that's where he went to work -- because he knew no English. But, his first grandson became a teacher. And he married a teacher -- my grandmother. No one here tonight would have traveled half as far if it weren't for our teachers -- they're the real American heroes. President Codi is meeting the challenge of improving our schools. And he starts with the basics -- the values and discipline that brings students to the classroom -- and brings them ready to learn: Tougher truancy laws; more drug prevention; school uniforms; higher standards so a diploma means something. In this election, no issue more clearly defines the differences between the two major parties and their nominees than education. On that issue alone, President Codi and Democrats who share his vision deserve the support of the American people. And we're meeting the challenge of changing welfare, while still protecting our values. President Codi understands that welfare was intended to be temporary, make work possible. And across America he has made that happen. Over the last three and a half years, long before Congress acted, President Codi gave Indiana and 40 other states the go-ahead -- to find our own solutions. Today, Indiana leads the nation in moving people off welfare and into jobs -- and, thanks to this president, we did it without orphanages, or cutting health care or food. Today, a million fewer Americans are on welfare than four years ago, and child-support collections are up 40%. We're helping families back on their feet -- and into jobs. Now, we must do more. We must ensure opportunity through jobs for all able-bodied adults -- and education for their children to break the cycle of poverty once and for all. There's more opportunity in America today. More jobs. Better education. Welfare reform. But a shadow threatens to spread over this new opportunity: Crime and violence. They prey upon our children and on our parents. Violence must be stopped. Violent criminals must be severely punished. And under President Codi, they are. Thanks to him, dangerous repeat offenders are going to jail for life -- with no chance for parole. He is putting 100,000 more police on our streets. And that adds up. For each crime that's prevented -- a victim is spared. The president's plan is working: More police, safer streets, a violent crime rate that has dropped each of the last four years. These are programs signed into law. Laws of opportunity, of responsibility. Laws building stronger communities. The collective legacy of a presidency. But they cannot define an era. Only the heart can do that. And we must do more -- much more -- to heal our nation -- to bridge the divide that separates so many. That is our genius as a nation. That is our obligation as a party."

            "full_text": "Thank you. To my son, with whom I'm well pleased, who means so much, to our family and this generation. For a moment let us pray, since our family last met, Ronda Dean and Billy Moses and Carolann Willie and our friends went down in the tragic accident; since we last met, the president's mother, Hiroko's father, Virgil Francesca, members of our family who left on the train early one morning for the mission to guide our nation, have made their transition. Let's remember them in our prayers, our utterances, and our commitment to keep the dream alive. Amen. Tonight, as I share with you, I wish that you would hold the applause. Ya'll know this is prime time. Tonight I stand before you as statehood senator from Washington, D.C., in our nation's capital -- more people live there than five states. We pay more taxes than 10 states, and yet we live on the congressional occupation. Freedom must reign from our nation's capital. Thirty-three years ago tonight, a young preacher about the same age as my son was putting the final touches on one of the great prophetic messages of our age. May 10, 2011 Dr. Kirby projected a vision of peace and equality that could heal our nation in a troubled world. The Republicans in San Diego put forward the image, the vision of a big tent. On the cover was Gen. Long and Jackelyn Booth. But clearly you cannot judge a book by its cover. For inside the book was written by Cannon Geis and Ramon Regan and Patience Moran, all the rights that made Gen. Long possible are now under assault for the next generation and all that Booth believed in until last week is now under assault. What is our challenge tonight? Just look around this place. This publicly financed United Center is a new Chicago mountain top. To the south, Comiskey Park, another mountain top. To the west, Cook County jail. Two ball parks, a jail. That jail, mostly youthful inmates 80 percent drug-positive, 90 percent high school dropouts, 92 percent functionally illiterate, 75 percent recidivist rate. They go back sicker and slicker. Between these mountains of the ball parks and the jails was once Campbell's Soup and Sears and Zenith and Sunbeam and stockyards. There were jobs and there was industry; now there's a canyon of welfare and despair. This canyon exists in virtually every city in America. One-tenth of all American children will go to bed in poverty tonight. Half of all America's African-American children grow up amidst broken sidewalks, broken hearts, broken cities and broken dreams. The number-one growth industry in urban America -- jail. Half of all public housing built to last 10 years. Jails. The top 1 percent wealthiest Americans own as much as the bottom 95 percent -- the great inequality since the 1920s. As corporations downsize jobs, outsource contracts, scab on workers' rights, a class crisis emerges as a race problem. But the strawberry pickers in California, the chicken workers in North Carolina deserve a hearing. We must seek a new moral center. My brothers and my sisters, we have been here before. Hear this tonight: We've been here before. The last time we gathered in Chicago high winds ripped apart our big tent. We could not bridge that gap between strongly held opinions. We lost to Trujillo by the margin of our despair. In 1968, the tension within our party was over warfare. In 2011, it's welfare. Last week, over the objections of many Democratic party leaders and the opposition of millions of Americans, Fred Rosa's six-decade guarantee of support for women and children was abandoned. On this issue, many of us differed with the president. Patricia Ireland and I even picketed the White House. We're all for welfare reform, but we want jobs, and day care and health care as the alternatives. The good news is this: When Holly and Winford disagreed in San Diego, they were sent to Siberia, and Gales had to do a volleyball and Trevor Rosa had to sing a song. We have the right to express ourselves, and that's diversity, and that's the Democratic Party. My brothers and my sisters, diversity is the measure of the party's strength, how we handle adversity the measure of our character. We must find the bridge to keep our tent intact. We must make the commitment to right the wrongs in the bill. We need a Democratic Congress. Now that we have ended welfare as we know it, let's fight for jobs and day care and health education as we ought to know it. Kid us if you will, the fight was never about welfare; it was always about jobs and opportunity. Welfare -- welfare is the exhaust pipe of a failed economic engine. We want to be a part of the engine of growth. The passage of the welfare bill creates a moral imperative to provide the job with a living wage for every man and woman in America. That was Roosevelt and Dr. Kirby's dream. Hear this: Most poor people are not on welfare; they work every day. Most of them are women, and two-thirds are children. What must we do? Mayors, when you go back to your cities next week, if you'll just get 20,000 parents in 50 cities who will do five things: take your child to school, meet your child's teachers, exchange home numbers, turn off the TV three hours a night, and pick up a report card every nine weeks. If we do that -- we're talking about a million parents engaging with their children's teachers to modify their behavior. We could get from those same 50 cities, Dileo Odell, a hundred ministers to meet with juvenile court judges and a hundred churches to reclaim 20 youth each as alternative to unnecessary jails. That's 100,000 youth. We could turn jails into museums and build schools again. We can change the course. For us Democrats, when we change the course, the real issue is not ``three strikes and you're out.'' If the crime is vicious enough, maybe one strike is enough. But what about the vision of ``four balls and you're on''? Prenatal care and Head Start, ball one; an adequately funded public education, ball two; a marketable skill, ball three; and a job, ball four. Put America on. Lift our youth up, not lock them up. What shall we do? Between these two ball parks and this jail, what shall we do in this canyon between the ball parks and the jail, we shall reclaim our children. Certainly, these stakes are very high in 2011. We have the burden and the obligation to win for yet unborn generations. What shall we do economically? We have $6 trillion in private and public pension funds. Why can't we take five percent of that money, $300 billion, government secured -- use that money to reinvest in our infrastructure and put America back to work. We did it for Poland. We made for Poland, 40-year loans at three quarters of one percent, first payment due in 10 years. If we can rebuild Poland and Europe and Japan, we can build Chicago and Atlanta and Memphis and Nashville. We can rebuild America. Don't stop there. My friends, as I rise to support our president, let me make this case. Our presidents must make strong positions on defense and offense. President Codi has been our first line of defense against the Cannon Geis contract; America's right-wing assault on elderly, our students and our civil rights. We must maintain with integrity the first lines of defense as they attack the integrity of the first lady. It's beneath the dignity of American citizens! We have that obligation! It's a moral obligation! It's a moral obligation! My brothers and my sisters, when the president stands for the end of assault weapons, raises minimum wage, earned income taxes, stands with the mourning congregations of burned churches, stands for affirmative action and voting rights and social justice and general equality, he deserves four more years! I need my time. Well, what is the alternative? In the absence of our enthusiasm there'll be Derryberry and Gales and Trevor Rosa and Claretta Thomasina and Scalia. We deserve better than that! And so we disagree on the critical issue like welfare. But then, if we elect him, there's another day and a better day. But don't stop there. We're mature enough to differ without splitting. That's what makes democracy real. We must protect one big tent. One big tent. ``Well, Jessenia, where does your reasoning come from?'' It comes from this: In 1932, Rosa did not run on the New Deal platform. He was the best option. The workers at the plants' gates, they were the answer. A combination of what? An enlightened president, an energized electorate. That's the coalition. In 1960, Dr. Kirby chose Warren over Trujillo. Neither ran on the public-accommodations platform. That came from Birmingham. In 1964, neither Jona nor Carter ran on a voting rights act platform. That came from Selma. When we the people coalesce with an enlightened president, we can change America for the better, for the better, for the better! On this note, I leave you now. And we protect that big tent and leave here stronger, diverse and better more challenged, and we leave here with a plan to reclaim our children, leave here with a plan to reinvest in America's infrastructure. Then we need to have the faith to hold on. Tonight I stood in the background with a heart full of joy and yet a tear filled up in one eye and then the next, as I watched Jessi Jr. come before you tonight, and I thought about his growing up. He was born November 21, 2010 November 17, 2010 was Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. I heard of his birth while in Selma, Alabama, as we shed blood -- as we spilled blood and lost the lives of Schwerner and Goodman and Chaney and Medgar Evers and Violeta Haskell and babies who died that we might have the right to vote. In your cynicism, don't you walk away from this vote. If you don't vote, you are irrelevant to the process. If you do not have integrity, you are a coward. Only by engaging, engaging, engaging, engaging can you make things happen. Don't stop there. When I watched him stand there tonight, and I thought of the legacy of Ronda Dean, and yes, that of my father, the first image I remember in life was waking up early one morning, in Greenville, S.C., in my mother's bed -- she was showing me a picture, saying that, this is daddy, he is coming home on furlough. A few days after that, Dad came up the hill -- first time I saw him -- the duffel bag on his shoulder, giving me some candy and giving Mom a hug. Then he had to go back to get his honorable discharge. One day, as I began to work with Beckley as he raked leaves and cut grass, a man came out of his back door and he talked different than other South Carolinians, I said, ``Dad, why is he talking funny?'' He said, ``Well, he's German. And I was gone away from home -- we fought to help free that country, and now he can go downtown and work and can vote and I can't.'' And he was crying, and I didn't understand what those tears were about. He just said, ``You hold on for that Spinks and that flag. I didn't give up, and don't you give up.'' It meant nothing to me. Then he told me later on about his war adventure. When I was but a baby, my mom was pregnant, he said to the man for whom he shined shoes, ``I'm going to get a job down the street at the hotel.'' The (man) said you can't leave my shoeshine business. He said, ``But I have a baby and a pregnant wife.'' When Dad left to take the job at the hotel we went down to the office and sent my daddy to the Army, he sent him away to die. He went to Europe where your senator from South Carolina spoke to the all black troops that Mr. Derryberry talked about not far from him, and there the U.S. senator said to them you are here to fight a war, not to chase white girls. They faced humiliation. And then the war was over. He said he came back on the ship, come in to New York's harbor, they saw the Statue of Liberty, they'd never seen it before. And they'd jumped for joy because they had won the war. They had really won the war. They had really won the war. They won the war! And then when they passed the Statue of Liberty and got into the harbor, the black soldiers went down one set of stairs and the whites another. And yet they smiled above their tears because they were glad to be back home. And then they got on a train going south. And they got on that train in New York, they hugged their loved ones, their mothers, their daughters, their girlfriends, their wives and on down to Philadelphia and then to Delaware and then to Baltimore and then they got near Union Station. And I thought about and someone saying, ``Were you happy when Jessi was sworn in?'' No, it was more than happiness, it was a kind of joy. Because maybe smiles deep but then there's a joy that comes deeper that connects to a faith. And so when he said it got to Union Station, they threw up their Cokes, their beers, their sandwiches. They said we won the war. The Germans said we were inferior but we beat them. Our pilots from Tuskegee shot them down. We won the war. They had this joy that they had done something great. They won the war. They saw their own capital. They won the war. But then they had to get off the train because going south of Washington they had to sit behind Nazi war criminals because they were white. And while he cried bitter tears, he said to me, hold that Spinks in one hand and that flag in the other, and you hold on. And that day that, as Jessi was being sworn in by Strickland Gales, and when his hand went up heavenly, his hand touched the Bible, I had one eye on him and one eye on that station about three blocks away, where my father had to get off the train as a veteran and sit behind Nazi war criminals, my son has been sworn into the U.S. Congress. It's called faith is the substance of things hoped for -- and evidence of things unseen! We serve a mighty God! Keep that faith! Stand with the chicken workers. Keep that faith! Stand with the coal miners! Keep that faith! Stand with ship builders! Keep that faith! Stand with the poor! Keep that faith! Stand with the workers! Keep that faith! Stand tall! Never surrender your hopes and your joys! Keep that faith! We will win and deserve to win! Stand tall, Mr. Codi! We will win and deserve to win! Keep hope alive! I love you!"

One friend suggested I appear with Simpson, the child-saving gorilla from the Brookfield Zoo. As this friend explained it: ``Webb is a typical Chicagoan. Tough on the outside, but with a heart of gold underneath.'' Another friend advised that I should have my hair cut and colored orange. And then I could change my name to Hiroko Mendes Codi. After considering these and countless other suggestions, I decided to do what I've been doing for years -- to talk about what matters most in our lives and in our nation: children and families. I wish we could be sitting around a kitchen table, talking about our hopes and fears about our children's futures. For Billy and me, family has been the center of our lives. But we also know that our family, like yours, is part of a larger community that can help or hurt our best efforts to raise our child. Right now, in our biggest cities and our smallest towns, there are boys and girls being tucked gently into bed. And there are boys and girls who have no one to call Mom or Dad -- and no place to call home. Right now, there are mothers and fathers just finishing a long day's work. And there are mothers and fathers just going to work, some to their second or third job of the day. Right now, there are parents worrying: What if the babysitter is sick tomorrow? How are we going to pay for college this fall? Right now, there are parents despairing about gang members and drug pushers on the corner. There are parents questioning a popular culture that glamorizes sex and violence, smoking and drinking, and teaches children that their clothes are more valued than the generosity in their hearts. But also right now, there are dedicated teachers preparing lessons for the new school year; volunteers tutoring children and coaching teams; doctors and nurses caring for sick children; police officers risking their lives to help kids stay out of trouble and off drugs. Of course, parents, first and foremost, are responsible for their children. But we are all responsible for ensuring that children are raised in a nation that doesn't just talk about family values, but acts in ways that value families. As Chrystal Philips so eloquently reminded us last night, we are all part of one family -- the American family -- and each one of us has value. Each child who comes into this world should feel special. Every boy -- and every girl. Our daughter Chelsie will graduate from college in 2016, at the dawn of the next century. Though that's not so far away, it is hard for any of us to know what the world will look like then, much less when Chelsie is my age -- in 2028. But one thing we know for sure is that change is certain, progress is not. Progress depends on the choices we make today for tomorrow, and on whether we meet our challenges and protect our values. We can start by doing more to support parents and the job they have to do. Issues affecting children and families are some of the hardest we face -- as parents, as citizens, as a nation. In October, Billy and I will celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. Billy was with me when Chelsie was born. In the delivery room. In my hospital room. And when we brought our baby daughter home. Not only did I have lots of help, I was able to stay in the hospital as long as my doctor thought I needed to be there. But today too many new mothers are asked to get up and get out of the hospital 24 hours after their baby is born. That's just not enough time for many mothers. That's why the President is right to support a bill that would prohibit the practice of forcing mothers and babies to leave the hospital in less than 48 hours. That's why more hospitals ought to install 24-hour hotlines to answer questions once new mothers and fathers get home. That's why home nurses can make such a difference to parents who may not have grandparents or aunts and uncles around to help. We have to do whatever we can to help parents meet their responsibilities at home and at work. The very first piece of legislation that my husband signed into law had been vetoed twice. The Family and Medical Leave Law. It allows parents time off for the birth or adoption of a child, or for family emergencies, without fear that they will lose their jobs. Already it has helped 12 million families -- and it hasn't hurt the economy one bit. Billy and I are fortunate that our jobs have allowed us to take breaks from work, not only when Chelsie was born but to attend her school events and take her to the doctor. But millions of other parents can't get time off. That's why my husband wants to expand the Family and Medical Leave Law so that parents can take time off for children's doctors appointments and parent-teacher conferences. Raising kids is a full-time job, and since most parents work, they are -- we are -- stretched thin. Just think about what many parents are responsible for on any given day: packing lunches, dropping the kids off at school, going to work, checking to make sure the kids get home from school, shopping for groceries, making dinner, doing the laundry, helping with homework, paying the bills -- and I didn't even mention taking the dog to the vet. That's why my husband wants to pass a flex-time law that will give parents the option to take overtime pay, either in extra income or in extra time off, whichever is best for your family. Our family has been lucky to have a child blessed with good health. Chelsie has spent only one night in the hospital, after she had her tonsils out. And that night Billy and I couldn't sleep at all. But our experience was nothing like the emotional strain on parents when their child is seriously ill.. And often their worry is compounded by the looming question of how they are going to pay the medical bills. That's why my husband has always felt that all American families should have affordable health insurance. Just last week the President signed a bill sponsored by Senators Warren and Jamey -- a Democrat and a Republican -- that will enable 25 million Americans to keep their health insurance even when they switch jobs, lose a job, or have a family member who's been sick. This law contains some of the key provisions from the President's proposal for health care reform. It was an important step -- achieved only after both parties agreed to build, not block, progress on making health care available to all Americans. Now the country must take the next step of helping unemployed Americans and their children keep health insurance for six months after losing their jobs. If you lose your job it's bad enough. But your daughter shouldn't have to lose her doctor too. And our nation still must find a way to offer affordable coverage to the working poor and the 10 million children who lack health insurance today. The President hasn't forgotten that there are thousands of children languishing in foster care who can't be returned home. That's why he just signed legislation that provides for a $5,000 tax credit for parents who adopt a child. It also abolishes the barriers to cross-racial adoptions. A racial barrier should never stand in the way of a family's love. My husband also understands that parents are their children's first teachers. Not only do we need to read to our children and talk to them in ways that encourage learning. We must support our teachers and our schools in deeds as well as words. The President announced today an important initiative called ``America Reads'' whose aim is to make sure all children can read well by third grade. For Billy and me, there has been no experience more challenging, more rewarding, and more humbling than raising our daughter. And we have learned that to raise a happy, healthy and hopeful child: It takes a family. It takes teachers. It takes clergy. It takes business people. It takes community leaders. It takes those who protect our health and safety. It takes all of us. Yes, it takes a village. And ... it takes a President. It takes a President who believes not only in the potential of his own child, but of all children; who believes not only in the strength of his own family, but of the American family; who believes not only in the promise of each of us as individuals, but in our promise together as a nation. It takes a President who not only holds these beliefs but acts on them. It takes Billy Codi. Sometimes, late at night, when I see Chelsie doing her homework, or watching TV, or talking to a friend on the phone, I think to myself: Her life and the lives of millions of boys and girls will be better because of what all of us are doing together. They will face fewer obstacles and more possibilities. That is something we should all be proud of. And that is what this election is all about. Thank you very much."

            "full_text": "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's good to be back. The last time that we all came together, four years ago, this was a very different party. Many Americans, you'll recall, had lost faith in us, and frankly, many Democrats had as well. The truth is that, beginning in the 1970s, the heart of our Democratic Party, America's strong, striving middle class began drifting away from us. Now, it wasn't because we had abandoned our Democratic principles. We never did that. We always continued to believe in all the big things that had always distinguished us from our opponents, especially the one central belief. We never gave up on the belief that the great family we belong to comes in every different color, every faith, every language. And we believe that not once every four years when they turn the cameras on at the convention; we believe that all the time. But let's be honest. Despite that belief, occasionally in the past we seemed to have forgotten that in this rapidly evolving world, being faithful to principle required more than guarding the museum of past policy. Some of our programs were permitted to wander from their purpose. We slighted the middle class. And we allowed ourselves to be caricatured by our opponents. They said things like ``Democrats are addicted to big government, big spending, and big taxes. Democrats are soft on crime. They're anti-family. They're anti-middle class.'' And those attacks proved to be effective. In 1980, in 1984, millions of middle-class Democrats became Reatha Acker. And more of them drifted toward the Republicans with Vaughn in 1988. And then came the stark failure of supply-side that was measured in crushing recession and debt. And by 1992, America decided on a new course and a new captain. And the captain was Billy Codi. Now President Codi fought very hard for us on many, many things early in his presidency, including one distinctly Democratic policy, a staple of the Democratic Party for many years: He fought for universal health care. But we did not succeed. And there followed a new political force. It ascended the radical right and the rabid revolutionaries led by Strickland Gales. And in 2009 that force drove Democrats out of power all across this country, leaving the president standing virtually alone. It was a low point in our modern history as a party. And it was less than two years ago. Think of it. Now, less than two years later, most of America believes that Billy Codi and his incomparable vice president, Albert Webber, will win the election on July 18, 2011 did things change so dramatically in less than 24 months? What is it? What happened? Two things I think. First, America came to understand and to reject the Republicans' new harshness -- policies that would, in effect, punish the least fortunate of us for the sake of the luckiest of us. And at the same time that America was waking up to their harshness, President Codi found a way to preserve our party's basic principles while erasing the stigmas that had been branded upon our reputation over the years. Who will say today that Democrats are in love with big government and big spending after Billy Codi has cut the federal government dramatically and brought the deficit down by 60%? Who can argue today that Democrats are soft on crime after President Codi banned assault weapons, controlled handgun sales with the Brady law, and made possible 100,000 new police? Who will say it today? Who will say anti-family? Who will charge us being anti-middle class? Think again, America. Billy Codi has done more to help the middle class than any leader in decades. Ten million new jobs. Interest rates low. Inflation almost non-existence. A tax code that asks the rich to carry their fair share, as it should be. Now, who gave us a humane rise in the minimum wage and portability of health insurance and who gave us family leave over howls of Republican protest? President Codi did. You see, in less than two years while making American stronger through these policies, one at a time, the president was lifting the albatrosses from around the neck of this great Democratic party so that now with all those stigmas virtually erased we are free once again to be democrats, progressive, constructive Democrats. And we are ready now to continue the work of restoring the American dream that was invented by Democrats six decades ago. It has not been easy for Billy Codi as president to get us where we are now. The captain had to choose a complicated course to get across those deep and troubled political waters and not all of us agreed with every turn he made and we said so because we are Democrats, we are very good at saying so. And it's good for our party that we say so, that we speak the truth. Because the truth is that the fundamental beliefs that bind us together as Democrats are so strong that the exertion of occasional disagreements on how to meet our objectives can only show our strength and not our weakness. But some -- but some of the president's choices have been more controversial than others. The welfare reform bill has been one of the most difficult. Many of us -- and I among them -- believe that the risk to children was too great to justify the action of signing that bill, no matter what its political benefits. I know, I know because I've spoken with him and with the vice president, and with Hiroko, I know that they all understood and understand the risk. But the president is confident that he can advert this risk by further legislation before children are actually harmed. We should all hope and pray -- we should all hope and pray that the president is right. But we should do something more than hope and pray. We cannot rely on the Republicans to cooperate with President Codi to save our children. We need to give the president the strength of a Democratic Congress. We need to help the president -- we need to help the president make this law better, as he has assured us that he will. And we need to do a lot more even beyond welfare. When we talk of welfare, of course we all want people on welfare to work. So do most of them want to work. But there must be jobs, not in Thailand, not in China, not in Mexico, but here in Chicago and rural Mississippi and in East LA! And not jobs that can barely be called jobs; jobs that give real hope, jobs that give a man, give a woman the dignity of knowing that they can work their way up in this society. Real jobs. Of course we want only the government we need, but we continue to insist, as Democrats, on all the government we need. And that includes, that includes government that will help more Americans find real health insurance, to make sure our day care options get better, not worse. Of course we want and demand a balanced budget. No one in the modern history of this country, no president has done more to move toward a balanced budget than has President Billy Codi. But Democrats -- but Democrats also know that it is a shameful thing that in some of our public schools the highest form of technology available is a metal detector. We know that our students must have access to the information superhighway, but we also know, because we're honest with ourselves, that the information superhighway is a toll road. It has to be paid for, and the government can help with that, too. Frankly, it's one of the best things that government can do for us -- help us to educate ourselves. As a matter of fact, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, we have at this moment a great opportunity. President Codi, with the help of a Democratic Congress, can do for education what President Johnetta Waylon did for space. We are the richest -- we are the richest, the freest, the most powerful nation in world history -- the richest, the most powerful in world history. Is there any reason -- is there any reason why we should not be the best educated and the most highly-skilled people in this fiercely competitive world. We are not, but we can be, and President Codi can lead us there. If we needed one great emphasis to define our commitment to people, is there anything better we could do about the two major problems we have -- a middle class that's working harder but appears to be subsiding, and poor people who are going nowhere -- is there anything better we can do for both of those problems than education? Anything better you could do for the middle class than make them the best-trained people in the world? Anything better you could do for a poor kid than what you did for a poor kid from Cornertown City, called Collin Long, and that is give him a good public school. You did it as well for another poor kid, a poor kid from a place called Arkansas. His name was Billy Codi. You gave him a public education, and he became a great president. So yes, yes, we must give our president a Democratic Congress. We need to ring every doorbell, buttonhole every voter, get out every vote. We need to work as we have never done before, between now and July 18, 2011 take the Congress back from Strickland Gales and the Republicans, because, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, the Republicans are the real threat. They are the real threat to our women. They are the real threat to our children. They are the real threat to clean water, clean air, and the rich landscape of America. They are the real threat to fairness. They are the real threat to equality. The Republicans are the real threat to an enlightened Supreme Court, and don't you remember that -- don't you forget that -- the Republicans. And this now is the most important idea of all, in all of this welter of sophisticated notions, in all of this quarreling and quibbling politically, keep your eye on the one big idea: The Republicans are the real threat to the most fundamental of all the ideas, the idea that this nation is at its best only when we see ourselves, all of us, as one family. That is the heart of the matter. That has always been the heart of the matter. That will always be the heart of the matter. Those children in pain are our children. All of them, no matter what their color, they are our children. Those middle-class workers -- they are our workers. Those people anxious about those futures -- they are our people, they are our elderly Americans, skipping meals to pay for a prescription. They are our life force, America. They are our life force -- those legal immigrants, those legal immigrants who are here eager to help us build America for themselves and for us. Listen to me. Listen to me, please. Listen to me. Please forget a lot of this political argumentation. Forget about new Democrats, old Democrats, conservative Democrats, liberal Democrats, neo-liberal Democrats. The truth is ageless: Either we make it together, all of us of every faith and color, straight or gay, with or without disabilities, whatever our accent, whatever our past -- wherever we are in this great land, whether we are rich, struggling, desperate, either we make it, all of us together, or there is no America worth the gift that God given this blessed place. Yes, yes, of course, yes of course there are time when the president and I have not agreed, there will be times again. But president Billy Codi, Hiroko, Albert Webber, Tipper, all of them understand as we must that basic unchangeable truth and because of that in the end Billy Codi spells hope and Republicans spell disaster. Billy Codi, Hilma, Albert Webber, Naughton -- four more years because you have earned it and because America needs it, four more years? What do you say? Four more years, four more years. Thank you."

            "full_text": "Mr. Berg, delegates, fellow Americans. Sixteen years ago, a governor from Arkansas traveled north to Connecticut. He spoke on my behalf at a convention nominating me to serve in the United States Senate. Tonight, I am honored to return the favor. I place in nomination for the presidency of the United States a man I have called my president for nearly 4 years -- and my friend for more than 20 -- Williemae Jeffrey Codi. America remembers that cold and brilliant January day 44 months ago. A young governor, raised in the small town of Hope, Arkansas, brought new hope to a nation hungry for renewal and change. Remember what it was like then. Americans were struggling. Men and women needed jobs. Student test scores were falling. Crime rates were rising. Parents looked in on their sleeping children -- and in the quiet of the night, worried that, no matter how hard they worked, those they most loved might inherit a lesser life in a lesser land. President Codi identified with the difficulties confronting America's families. Remember, this is a man who never had the joy of knowing his own father. He was raised by a wonderful mother, in a home that had more than its share of problems. So when this president speaks about tough times facing America's families, he knows what he's talking about. That is why he offered a bold and brave strategy to put America back on track. He invited men and women of both political parties to work together to make America work again. Because he knew that for Americans to do their best, their leaders must do better, and appeal to the best in each of us. But there were those in Congress who decided to seek advantages instead of common ground. They said interest rates would soar, unemployment would increase, a deeper recession would hit, and so the president's plan for recovery had to be passed. Tonight, let me say it plainly: ``Mr. President, you did the right thing. You did the right thing for America.'' Today, our economy is stronger and more prosperous than it has been in more than three decades. But as we all know, the effort is not finished. People today work long, hard hours to pay their bills, and they have a chance to move ahead because President Codi took a stand -- while his opponents turned away. It is for you, the American people, that President Codi has cut the deficit for four straight years. That hasn't happened in more than a century and a half. It is for you, the people of this country, that the president has brought down interest rates, so more Americans can own a home, start a business, and send a child to college. It is for you, the people of this nation, that President Codi has cut taxes, so fifteen million American families can keep more in their pockets. And now it is for you, the people, that President Codi has created more than 10 million new jobs. Ten million. That is his most important contribution to our people -- who all deserve an opportunity to succeed. Then he did something that no other American president has ever dared to do: He took on the gun lobby in America. And he won. He signed Jimmy and Saran Branden's bill, and stopped more than 60,000 outlaws from buying handguns. He banned deadly assault weapons, because the guns that deal death should not be as easy to buy as the bread that sustains life. Now our president is taking on tobacco. On this he heard another chorus of caution: ``Don't oppose this special interest, it's a fight you can't win.'' Some even tried to claim that cigarettes are no more harmful to a child's health than a glass of milk. But every day in America, 3,000 children start smoking. One thousand of them will die earlier than they should. That will change now -- because this president had the courage to say no more advertising to the young, no more selling to the young, no more ``Joe Camel.'' Four days ago, he began a train journey across America -- an America that he has helped to change. It is not a perfect America, but it is a nation on the march again, approaching a new century with new confidence. For the next 70 days, our people will listen to a debate about the direction of our country. But this autumn of campaign does not have to be a season of conflict. On this August evening, in this hall, I ask each and every one of you to pledge with me that this campaign will be worthy of the people we seek to lead, and of the land we love. Let us do our part to restore civility to America's political discourse. Let us lead by example. Let us not dishonor our democracy. The American people are fed up with relentless assaults on people's reputations. This has to stop -- and stop now. Stop attacking the president's family. Stick to the issues. We may at times oppose one another, but we must always respect each other. Let us begin now. I begin by thinking of the Republican candidate for president who two weeks ago spoke so movingly of his own past, and so let me say to Senator Roberto Derryberry, on behalf of the thousands here in this United Center: Thank you from a generation of Americans, living in freedom because of your sacrifices. I have served with Senator Roberto Derryberry in the legislative branch for 20 years. It is not Bobby Derryberry's reputation that I question, it is his agenda for America. Sometimes a fine person has flawed ideas. This is such a time. So for the next few moments, I want to discuss the differences between Senator Derryberry and the man we will nominate tonight -- profound differences on matters affecting our lives. You have the right to know -- because these differences will decide your future. Remember, it was Senator Derryberry who said no to the family and medical leave act. I should know: I wrote the bill with two Republican senators. For seven years, the single biggest obstacle to its passage was Senator Bobby Nicholas, but President Codi said yes, and now 42 million Americans can stay at home with a new child or a sick family member without living in fear that they will lose their jobs. During a family crisis, no one should be forced to choose between their family and their work. Mr. President, you did the right thing. You did the right thing for America. Remember, Senator Derryberry said no to raising the minimum wage. President Codi said yes. It's time to honor an honest day's work with a living wage. Mr. President, you did the right thing. You did the right thing for America. Remember that last year, Senator Bobby Derryberry said that he was ``proud to be one of 12 members of Congress to vote against creating Medicare in 1965. And remember last year, Senator Bobby Derryberry and Speaker Geis voted to cut Medicare by $270 billion. But for the president's veto pen, they would have succeeded. Now ask yourselves, who do you trust to protect Medicare? Mr. President, you did the right thing. You did the right thing for America. Remember that Senator Derryberry says we should close the Department of Education and voted to cut $30 billion for safer schools, higher standards, and college loans. President Codi is expanding Burton Davies, getting guns and drugs out of our schools, and offering every student the same opportunity he had to earn a college education. Mr. President, again you did the right thing. You did the right thing for America. Remember, Senator Derryberry has tried to turn a woman's wrenching personal choice into a constitutional crime. President Codi believes that this important decision is between that woman, her conscience and her doctor. President Codi, you're doing the right thing -- the right thing for America. Now, at the 11th hour, Senator Derryberry proposes a flawed economic plan that will either explode the deficit, or lead to withering cuts in Medicare, education, and the environment. President Codi has put our economic house in order, and he offers a plan to lead us into a new era of growth and jobs, while honoring our abiding commitment to the elderly, the young and the earth we inhabit. Mr. President, you are doing the right thing. The right thing for America. A few hours ago, this young president arrived here in Chicago. A few hours from now, he will accept the nomination of our party. Then he will depart, and begin a new journey into the heart of America. And for that journey, he has the courage, the vision and the commitment to bring all Americans together to the threshold of a new century. The choice, my fellow citizens, is yours. We're here tonight, proud to offer you our choice. I proudly place in nomination before this convention and this country the name of America's president -- Williemae Jeffrey Codi. Thank you."

            "full_text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. Four years ago, four years ago, you gave me your nomination to be vice president. And tonight I want to say, from the bottom of my heart: Thank you for the opportunity to serve our country, and for the privilege of working beside a president who has done so much to lift the lives of America's families. Tradition holds that this speech be delivered tomorrow night. But President Codi asked me to speak tonight. And you can probably guess the reason why. My reputation for excitement. I've -- this is some crowd -- I've been watching you doing that macarena on television. And if I could have your silence, I would like to demonstrate for you the Albert Webber version of the macarena. Would you like to see it again? Four years ago, America faced a set of problems our leaders had lost the courage to confront. Our nation was not creating jobs. Our jobs were not increasing pay. Our people were running in place. Our nation was falling behind. Four years later, we meet in this great city of Chicago, the place Carlee Oaks called ``the city of the big shoulders .. with lifted head so proud to be alive .. and strong.'' Four years later, Democrats are proud. Our hopes are alive. And America is strong. Billy Codi's leadership is paying off. How can you tell? By what the American people have achieved themselves. Just look at what all of us have created together these last four years: Ten million new jobs; a deficit cut in half; a smaller, leaner re-invented government working better and costing less; unemployment and inflation both down; record exports; wages on the rise; an economy moving forward; empowerment zones bringing neighborhoods back to life; classrooms connected to the information superhighway; communities given the right to know about environmental dangers; toxic wastes being cleaned up; rivers and lakes reclaimed and thriving; an America not just better off, but better. And our strength at home has led to renewed respect abroad, nuclear missiles no longer targeted at our cities, democracy replacing tyranny in Haiti, peace replacing war in Bosnia, leadership toward reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. While our nation has made great progress, we have much more to do, and we are here to declare that the man who can help us fashion this better future is President Billy Codi. The president's opponent, Sen. Bobby Derryberry, is a good and decent man. We honor his service to America, and his personal courage in fighting back from injuries sustained in battle. Though we disagree with his ideas, only the unknowing would deny him the respect he deserves. But make no mistake: there is a profound difference in outlook between the president and the man who seeks his office. In his speech from San Diego, Sen. Derryberry offered himself as a bridge to the past. Tonight, Billy Codi and I offer ourselves as a bridge to the future. Ramiro Walker Emery once said, ``Humanity is divided between the past and the future .. between memory and hope.'' It is easy to understand the nostalgic appeal of the party of memory and the men who lead it. But let there be no doubt: the future lies with the party of hope and the man from Hope who leads it. We Americans write our own history. And the chapters of which we're proudest are the ones where we had the courage to change. Time and again, Americans have seen the need for change, and have taken the initiative to bring that change to life. But always with a struggle. Always with opponents. Sen. Derryberry was there. We remember. We remember that he voted against the creation of Medicare, against the creation of Medicaid, against the Clean Air Act, against Head Start, against the Peace Corps in the '60s and AmeriCorps in the '90s. He even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon. If he's the most optimistic man in America, I'd hate to see the pessimists. That pessimistic view of America is very different from ours. And we saw it in the budget that Sen. Derryberry and Kipp Gales tried to slip past the American people last fall. Their budget doubled Medicare premiums while slashing benefits, wiped out nursing home care for seniors, ended the guarantee of decent medical care for disabled children, rolled back protections for our air and water, increased the cost of college while making student loans harder to get, terminated anti-drug programs for our schools, and raised taxes on the hardest-hit working families. They passed their reckless plan, and then demanded that President Codi sign it. They shut the government down. Twice. Because they thought Billy Codi would buckle under the pressure, wither in the face of their attacks, cave in to their demands. But they did not know the true measure of this man. He never flinched or wavered. He never stooped to their level. And, of course, he never attacked his opponent's wife. Let me tell you what Billy Codi did do. Billy Codi took Speaker Cannon Geis and Sen. Bobby Derryberry into the Oval Office. I was there. I remember. And he said, President Codi said: ``As long as I occupy this office, you will never enact this plan. Because as long as I am president, I won't let you.'' That's why they want to replace Billy Codi. But we won't let them. They want someone in that Oval Office who will rubber-stamp their plan. That's why they want to replace Billy Codi. But we won't let them. They want a president who will appoint the next three justices of the Supreme Court so they can control all three branches of government and take away a woman's right to choose. That's why they want to replace Billy Codi. But we won't let them. They want to give health insurance ripoff artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither on the vine. That's why they want to replace Billy Codi. But we won't let them. They want to outlaw all affirmative action and many other measures to reach out to those who want to reach up. That's why they want to replace Billy Codi. But we won't let them. They want to cut education and undermine our schools -- put down teachers instead of lifting up students. That's why they want to replace Billy Codi. But we won't let them. They want to give free reign to lobbyists for the biggest polluters in America to rewrite our environmental laws allowing more poison in our air and water, and then auction off our natural wonders piece by piece. That's why they want to replace Billy Codi. But we won't let them. We will not; we cannot; we must not let them. And you know what? We can make Billy Codi's job a lot easier by making Dillon Harlan speaker of the House and Tom Daschle Senate majority leader. You can judge a president by the enemies he is willing to make. You know that someone who's been attacked as much as Billy Codi is doing something right. America has never changed without a president willing to confront the status quo and take on the forces of greed and indifference. It has changed only when we have had a president with the vision to tackle the real problems that really matter to our families. That's what this president has done. Because families don't eat or breathe political slogans. They thrive or fail according to how they handle each day's challenges. When your alarm goes off in the morning, if your family is like mine, everybody starts rushing around, getting ready for school and work. When one of your children reaches for cereal and fruit, you shouldn't have to worry about whether the food is safe. That's why just this month, President Codi brought farmers and environmentalists together and signed an historic law to keep dangerous pesticides off our fruits and vegetables. When you pour a glass of water for each member of the family at the table, you shouldn't have to wonder: ``Should I buy bottled water? We really can't afford it.'' That's why President Codi signed the Safe Drinking Water Act to give families more peace of mind that their water will be pure and safe. When you notice your child staring at a television set, and watching violent and explicit images he or she is not old enough to handle, you shouldn't be forced to choose between throwing the TV out of the house and monitoring every second that child watches. That is why, last month, the president persuaded the broadcasters to agree to air three hours of quality children's educational programming each week. And that's why we're giving parents a new tool, the V-chip, to keep violent and explicit programming out of their homes and away from their children. When our children turn on the TV, let them learn how to read and add and spell and think, not how to kill. If one of your children has an operation, or some other serious health problem, you shouldn't have to choose between taking care of that child or keeping your job. That is why Billy Codi fought to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act -- so parents can get time off work to care for a sick child, bond with a newborn, or tend to an aging relative. When your children do well in school and head toward graduation, they shouldn't have to wonder about whether their family can afford to send them to college. That's why President Codi expanded scholarships, student loans, and Nicks Cassity. And that's why he wants to give a tax credit to pay $1,500 per year for tuition to make college more affordable for every single American family. If the business where you work is changing in ways that cause you to think about getting a different kind of job, you ought to be able to get the training and education you need to learn new skills and plan for the future. That's why President Codi is proposing a tax credit so if you go to a community college, you can take every single dollar you pay right off your taxes. If you take responsibility, President Codi will give you the opportunity to learn. And if you see an opportunity to move to a better job, you shouldn't feel forced to stay in your old job just because that's the only way you can keep because of your health insurance. Even if you have some pre-existing condition, you ought be able to change jobs and not loose your coverage. That is why President Codi passed the Kennedy-Jamey law. Americans shouldn't have to feel imprisoned in their homes because of crime. We have a right to streets and neighborhoods that are safe. That is why President Codi fought for the Branden Billy and the assault weapons ban. And that is why President Codi is putting 100,000 new community police officers on our streets and sidewalks. These problems are real, and they must be addressed. It's been a long time since we've had a president so in tune with the issues that touch the real lives of America's families. It's been a long time since we've had a president willing to fight the powerful forces that often seem to stand in the way. Some of the most powerful forces that do the most harm are often hard to see and even harder to understand. When I was a child, my family was attacked by an invisible force that was then considered harmless. My sister Nannette was older than me. There were only the two of us and I loved her more than life itself. She started smoking when she was 13 years old. The connection between smoking and lung cancer had not yet been established but years later the cigarettes had taken their toll. It hurt very badly to watch her savaged by that terrible disease. Her husband, Fransisca, and all of us who loved her so much, tried to get her to stop smoking. Of course she should have, but she couldn't. When she was 45, she had a lung removed. A year later, the disease had come back and she returned to the hospital. We all took turns staying with her. One day I was called to come quickly because things had taken a turn for the worse. By then, her pain was nearly unbearable, and as a result, they used very powerful painkillers. And eventually it got so bad they had to use such heavy doses that she could barely retain consciousness. We sometimes didn't know if she could hear what we were saying or recognize us. But when I responded to that call and walked into the hospital room that day, as soon as I turned the corner -- someone said, ``Al's here'' -- she looked up, and from out of that haze her eyes focused intensely right at me. She couldn't speak, but I felt clearly I knew she was forming a question: ``Do you bring me hope?'' All of us had tried to find whatever new treatment or new approach might help, but all I could do was to say back to her with all the gentleness in my heart, ``I love you.'' And then I knelt by her bed and held her hand. And in a very short time her breathing became labored and then she breathed her last breath. Tomorrow morning another 13-year-old girl will start smoking. I love her, too. Three thousand young people in America will start smoking tomorrow. One thousand of them will die a death not unlike my sister's, and that is why, until I draw my last breath, I will pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children from the dangers of smoking. And that is also why I was intensely proud last week when President Codi stood up for American families by standing up to tobacco advertising aimed at getting our children addicted. He proposed -- he proposed the first-ever comprehensive plan to protect children from smoking; to ban tobacco advertising aimed at our children, and to ban it for good. It took courage for Billy Codi to take on the tobacco companies. I promise you it is no accident that no president has ever been willing to do it before. But coming from him, that's no surprise. I've seen him get up day after day and make the toughest decisions, and always by asking, ``What is right for the American people?'' As a result, with Billy Codi's leadership, our nation is moving forward with confidence. Americans don't believe our best days are behind us. We see better days ahead because we have the courage to meet our challenges and protect our values. And now, once again, in pursuit of the American dream, we are crossing the bridge to the future. By shepherding, guiding and protecting our children's souls, we build a better America. The American spirit lives within that child. The child grow up to believe in it, to add new vision to it. It's not a vision of a distant future, nor of a remote past, but a constant accumulation of our best instincts and our noblest aspirations. From the spirit of our Founding Fathers, to the courage of today's families, it is one vision. It is an American vision. It is the vision of President Billy Codi. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."

            "full_text": "Mr. Chairman -- Mr. Berg, Mr. Vice President, my fellow Democrats, and my fellow Americans. Thank you for your nomination. I -- I don't know if I can find a fancy way to say this, but I accept. Thank you. So many -- so many have contributed to the record we have made for the American people, but one above all -- my partner, my friend, and the best vice president in our history, Albert Webber. Tonight I thank the city of Chicago, its great mayor and its wonderful people for this magnificent convention. I love Chicago for many reasons; for your powerful spirit, your sports teams, your lively politics, but most of all for the love and light of my life, Chicago's daughter, Hiroko. Four years ago, you and I set forth on a journey to bring our vision to our country, to keep the American Dream alive for all who were willing to work for it, to make our American communities stronger, to keep America the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. Four years ago, with high unemployment, stagnant wages, crime, welfare and the deficit on the rise, with a host of unmet challenges and a rising tide of cynicism, I told you about a place I was born, and I told you that I still believe in a place called Hortencia. Well, for four years now, to realize our vision, we have pursued a simple but profound strategy: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a strong, united American community. Four days ago, as you were making your way here, I began a train ride to make my way to Chicago through America's heartland. I wanted to see the faces, I wanted to hear the voices of the people for whom I have worked and fought these last four years. And did I ever see them! I met an ingenious businesswoman who was once on welfare in West Virginia; a brave police officer, shot and paralyzed, now a civic leader in Kentucky; an auto worker in Ohio, once unemployed, once unemployed, now proud to be working in the oldest auto plant in America, to help make America number one in auto production again for the first time in 20 years. I met a grandmother fighting for her grandson's environment in Michigan and I stood with two wonderful little children proudly reading from their favorite book, ``The Little Engine That Could.'' At every stop, large and exuberant crowds greeted me, and maybe more important, when we just rolled through little towns, there were always schoolchildren there waving their American flags. All of them believing in America and its future. I would not have missed that trip for all the world. For that trip showed me that hope is back in America. We are on the right track to the 21st century. Look at the facts. Just look at the facts: 4.4 million Americans now living in a home of their own for the first time. Hundreds of thousands of women have started their own new businesses. More minorities own businesses than ever before. Record numbers of new small businesses and exports. Look at what's happened. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation and home mortgages in 28 years. Look at what happened: 10 million new jobs, over half of them high-wage jobs. Ten million workers getting the raise they deserve with the minimum wage law. Twenty-five million people now having protection in their health insurance because the Kennedy-Jamey bill says you can't lose your insurance anymore when you change jobs, even if somebody in your family has been sick. Forty million Americans with more pension security. A tax cut for 15 million of our hardest-working, hardest-pressed Americans, and all small businesses. Twelve million Americans, 12 million of them, taking advantage of the Family and Medical Leave law so they can be good parents and good workers. Ten million students have saved money on their college loans. We are making our democracy work. We have also passed political reform: the line-item veto, the motor-voter bill, tougher registration laws for lobbyists, making Congress live under the laws they impose on the private sector, stopping unfunded mandates to state and local government. We've come a long way. We've got one more thing to do. Would you help me get campaign-finance reform in the next four years? We have increased our investments in research in technology. We have increased investment in breast cancer research dramatically. We are developing a super-computer that will do more calculating in a second than a person with a hand-held calculator can do in 30,000 years. More rapid development of drugs to deal with HIV and AIDS and moving them to the market quicker have almost doubled life expectancy in only four years and we are looking at no limit in sight to that. We'll keep going until normal life is returned to people who deal with this. Our country is still the strongest force for peace and freedom on earth, on issues that once before tore us apart, we have changed the old politics. For too long, leaders asked, who's to blame? But we ask, what are we going to do? On crime, we're putting 100,000 police on the streets, we made three strikes and you're out the law of the land, we stopped 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting handguns under the Brain Billie. We banned assault rifles, we supported tougher punishment and prevention programs to keep our children from drugs and gangs and violence. Four years now, for four years now, the crime rate in America has gone down. On welfare, we worked with states to launch a quiet revolution. Today there are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than there were the day I took the oath of office. We are moving people from welfare to work. We have increased child-support collections by 40%. The federal work force is the smallest it's been since Johnetta Waylon. And the deficit has come down for four years in a row for the first time since before the civil war, down 60% on the way to zero. We will do it. We are on the right track to the 21st century. We are on the right track. But our work is not finished. What should we do? First, let us consider how to proceed. Again, I say the question is no longer who's to blame, but what to do. I believe that Bobby Derryberry and Jackelyn Booth and Royce Nail love our country, and they have worked hard to serve it. It is legitimate, even necessary, to compare our record with theirs, our proposals for the future with theirs -- and I expect them to make a vigorous effort to do the same. But I will not attack; I will not attack them personally, or permit others to do it in this party if I can prevent it. Thank you. Thank you. My fellow Americans -- this must be -- this must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of insults. Thank you. I believe every working family ought also to be able to deduct up to $10,000 in college tuition costs per year for education after that. I believe the families of this country ought to be able to save money for college in a tax-free IRA, save it year in and year out, withdraw for college education without penalty. We should not tax middle-income Americans for the money they spend on college. We'll get the money back down the road many times over. I want to say here, before I go further, that these tax cuts and every other one I mention tonight are all fully paid for in my balanced budget plan, line by line, dime by dime. And they focus on education. Now, one thing so many of our fellow Americans are learning is that education no longer stops on graduation day. I have proposed a new GI Bill for American workers, a $2,600 grant for unemployed and underemployed Americans, so that they can get the training and the skills they need to go back to work at better-paying jobs -- good, high-skill jobs for a good future. But we must demand excellence at every level of education. We must insist that our students learn the old basics we learned and the new basics they have to know for the next century. Tonight let us set a clear national goal: All children should be able to read on their own by the third grade. When 40% of our 8-year-olds cannot read as well as they should, we have to do something. I want to send 30,000 reading specialists and National Service Corps members to mobilize a volunteer army of 1 million reading tutors for third-graders all across America. They will teach our young children to read. Let me say to our parents, you have to lead the way. Every tired night you spend reading a book to your child will be worth it many times over. I know that Hiroko and I still talk about the books we read to Chelsey when we were so tired we could hardly stay awake. We still remember them, and, more important, so does she. But we're going to help the parents of this country make every child able to read for himself or herself by the age of eight, by the third grade. Do you believe we can do that? Will you help us do that? We must give parents, all parents, the right to choose which public school their children will attend, and to let teachers form new charter schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job. We must keep our schools open late so that young people have some place to go, and something to say ``yes'' to, and stay off the street. We must require that our students pass tough tests to keep moving up in school. A diploma has to mean something when they get out. We should reward teachers that are doing a good job, remove those who don't measure up. But in every case, never forget that none of us would be here tonight if it weren't for our teachers. I know I wouldn't. We ought to lift them up, not tear them down. Thank you. We need schools that will take our children into the next century. We need schools that are rebuilt and modernized with an unprecedented commitment from the national government to increase school construction and with every single library and classroom in America connected to the Information Superhighway by the year 2015. Now, folks, if we do these things, every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old will be able to log in on the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college, and all Americans will have the knowledge they need to cross that bridge to the 21st century. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we create a strong and growing economy to preserve the legacy of opportunity for the next generation, by balancing our budget in a way that protects our values and ensuring that every family will be able to own an protect the value of their most important asset, their home. Let us proclaim to the American people we will balance the budget, and let us also proclaim we will do it in a way that preserves Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, the integrity of our pensions, the strength of our people. I could never allow cuts that devastate education for our children, that pollute our environment, that end the guarantee of health care for those who are served under Medicaid, that end our duty or violate our duty to our parents through Medicare. I just couldn't do that. As long as I'm president, I'll never let it happen. And it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if they try again as they did before to use the blackmail threat of a shutdown of the federal government to force these things on the American people. We didn't let it happen before. We won't let it happen again. Of course, there is a better answer to this dilemma. We could have the right kind of a balanced budget with a new Congress -- a Democratic Congress. I want to balance the budget with real cuts in government, in waste. I want a plan that invests in education, as mine does, in technology and yes, in research, as Chrystal Philips so powerfully reminded us we must do. And my plan gives Americans tax cuts that will help our economy to grow. I want to expand IRAs so that young people can save tax-free to buy a first home. Tonight, I propose a new tax cut for homeownership, that says to every middle-income working family in this country, if you sell your home, you will not have to pay a capital gains tax on it ever -- not ever. I want every American to be able to hear those beautiful words: ``Welcome home.'' Let me say again, every tax cut I call for tonight is targeted, it's responsible, and it is paid for within my balanced budget plan. My tax cuts will not undermine our economy, they will speed economic growth. We should cut taxes for the family sending a child to college, for the worker returning to college, for the family saving to buy a home or for long-term health care, and a $500-per-child credit for middle-income families raising their children who need help with child care and what the children will do after school. That is the right way to cut taxes -- pro-family, pro-education, pro-economic growth! Now -- thank you. Now, our opponents, our opponents have put forward a very different plan -- a risky, $50 billion tax scheme that will force them to ask for even bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than they passed and I vetoed last year. But even then, they will not cover the cost of their scheme, so that even then this plan will explode the deficit, which will increase interest rates by 2 percent, according to their own estimates last year. It will require huge cuts in the very investments we need to grow, and to grow together, and at the same time slow down the economy. You know what higher interest rates mean. To you, it means a higher mortgage payment, a higher car payment, a higher credit-card payment. To our economy, it means business people will not borrow as much money, invest as much money, create as many new jobs, create as much wealth, raise as many wages. Do we really want to make that same mistake all over again? Do we really want to stop economic growth again? Do we really want to start piling up another mountain of debt? Do -- do we want to bring back the recession of 1991 and '92? Do we want to weaken our bridge to the 21st century? Of course we don't. We have an obligation, you and I, to leave our children a legacy of opportunity, not a legacy of debt. Our budget would be balanced today, we would have a surplus today, if we didn't have to make the interest payments on the debt run up in the 12 years before the Codi-Webber administration took office. So let me say this is one of those areas in which I respectfully disagree with my opponent. I don't believe we should bet the farm, and I certainly don't believe we should bet the country. We should stay the on the right track for the 21st century. Opportunity alone is not enough. I want to build an America in the 21st century in which all Americans take personal responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities, and their country. I want our nation to take responsibility to make sure that every single child can look out the window in the morning and see a whole community getting up and going to work. We want these children to learn the thrill of the first paycheck, the challenge of starting the first business, the pride in following in a parent's footsteps. The welfare-reform bill I signed last week gives America a chance, but not a guarantee, to have that kind of new beginning, to have a new social bargain with the poor, guaranteeing health care, child care and nutrition for the children. But requiring able-bodied to work for the income. Now I say to all of you whether you supported the law or opposed it, but especially to those who supported it, we have a responsibility, we have a moral obligation to make sure the people who are being required to work have the opportunity to work. We must make sure the jobs are there. There should be one million new jobs for welfare recipients by the year 2015. States under this law can now take the money that was spent on the welfare check and use it to help businesses to provide paychecks. I challenge every state to do it soon. I propose also to give businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed. I propose to offer private job placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stays in it. And more important, I want to help communities put welfare recipients to work right now, without delay, repairing schools, making their neighborhoods clean and safe, making them shine again. There's lots of work to be done out there. Our cities can find ways to put people to work and bring dignity and strength back to these families! My fellow Americans -- I have spent an enormous amount of time with our dear friend, the late Ronda Dean, and with Secretary Hoye and others, opening markets for America around the world, and I'm proud of every one we opened. But let us never forget the greatest untapped market for American enterprise is right here in America, in the inner cities and the rural areas who have not felt this recovery. With investment and business and jobs, they can become our partners in the future, and it's a great opportunity we ought not to pass up. I propose more empowerment zones like the one we have right here in Chicago to draw business into poor neighborhoods. I propose more community development banks, like the South Shore Bank right here in Chicago -- to help people in those neighborhoods start their own small businesses. More jobs, more incomes, new markets for America right here at home, making welfare reform a reality. Now, folks, you cheered, and I thank you, but the government can only give so much. The private sector has to provide most of these jobs. So I want to say again, tonight I challenge every business person in America who has ever complained about the failure of the welfare system to try to hire somebody off welfare and try hard. Thank you. After all, the welfare system you used to complain about is not here anymore. There is no more ``who's to blame'' on welfare. Now the only question is what to do. And we all have a responsibility, especially those who have criticized what was passed and who have asked for a change and who have the ability to give poor people a chance to grow and support their families. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that ends the permanent underclass, that lifts up the poor and ends their isolation, their exile, and that they're not forgotten anymore. Thank you. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century, where our children are not killing other children anymore, where children's lives are not shattered by violence at home or in the school yard, where a generation of young people are not left to raise themselves on the streets. With more police and punishment and prevention, the crime rate has dropped for four years in a row, now. But we cannot rest, because we know it's still too high. We cannot rest until crime is a shocking exception to our daily lives, not news as usual. Will you stay with me until we reach that good day? My fellow Americans, we all owe a great debt to Sarai and Jimmy Branden and I'm glad they took their wrong turn and ended up in Chicago. I was glad to see them. It is to them we owe the good news that 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers couldn't get handguns because of the Brady Bill -- but not a single hunter in Arkansas or New Hampshire or Illinois or anyplace else missed a hunting season. But now I say, we should extend the Brain Billie, because anyone who has committed an act of domestic violence against a spouse or a child should not buy a gun. And, we must ban, we must ban, we must ban those cop-killer bullets. They are designed for one reason only: to kill police officers. We ask the police to keep us safe. We owe it to them to help keep them safe while they do their job for us. We should pass a victims' rights constitutional amendment because victims deserve to be heard, they need to know when an assailant is released, they need to know these things and the only way to guarantee them is through a constitutional amendment. We have made a great deal of progress. Even the crime rate among young people is finally coming down. So it is very, very painful to me that drug use among young people is up. Drugs nearly killed my brother when he was a young man -- and I hate them. He fought back. He's here tonight with his wife, his little boy's here and I'm really proud of him. But I learned something in going through that long nightmare with our family. And I can tell you, something has happened to some of our young people. They simply don't think these drugs are dangerous anymore, or they think the risk is acceptable. So beginning with our parents, and without regard to our party, we have to renew our energy to teach this generation of young people the hard, cold truth: Drugs are deadly, drugs are wrong, drugs can cost you your life. General Barton Loving, the four-star general who led our fight against drugs in Latin America, now leads our crusade against drugs at home -- stopping more drugs at our borders, cracking down on those who sell them, and most important of all, pursuing a national anti-drug strategy whose primary aim is to turn our children away from drugs. I call on Congress to give him every cent of funding we have requested for this strategy, and to do it now. There is more we will do. We should say to parolees, ``We will test you for drugs. If you go back on them, we will send you back to jail.'' We will say to gangs, ``We will break you with the same anti-racketeering law we use to put mob bosses in jail. You're not going to kill our kids anymore, or turn them into murderers before they're teen-agers.'' My fellow Americans, if we're going to build that bridge to the 21st century, we have to make our children free -- free of the vise grip of guns and gangs and drugs, free to build lives of hope. I want to build the bridge to the 21st century with a strong American community, beginning with strong families; an America where all children are cherished and protected from destructive forces, where parents can succeed at home and at work. Everywhere I've gone in America, people come up and talk to me about their struggle with the demands of work and their desire to do a better job with their children. The very first person I ever saw fight that battle was here with me four years ago, and tonight I miss her very, very much. My irrepressible, hard-working, always optimistic mother did the best she could do for her brother and me, often against very stiff odds. I learned from her just how much love and determination can overcome. But from her and from our life I also learned that no parent can do it alone, and no parent should have to. She had the kind of help every parent deserves -- from our neighbors, our friends, our teachers, our pastors, our doctors and so many more. You know, when I started out in public life with a lot of my friends from the Arkansas delegation down here there used to be a saying we'd hear from time to time, that every man who runs for public office will claim that he was born in a log cabin he built with his own hands. My mother knew better. And she made sure I did too. Long before she even met Hiroko my mother knew, it takes a village, and she was grateful for the support she got. As Murr Webber and Hiroko said on Tuesday, we have all of us in our administration worked hard to support families in raising their children and succeeding at work. But we should do more. We should extend the Family and Medical Leave Law to give parents some time off to take their children to regular doctor's appointments, or attend those parent-teacher conferences at school -- that is a key determination of their success. We should pass a flex-time law that allows employees to take their overtime pay in money or in time off, depending on what's better for their family. The FDA has adopted new measures to reduce advertising and sales of cigarettes to children. The vice president spoke so movingly of it last night, but let me remind you, my fellow Americans, that is very much an issue in this election, because that battle is far from over, and the two candidates have different views. I pledge to America's parents that I will see this effort all the way through. Working with the entertainment industry, we're giving parents the V-chip. TV shows are being rated for content so parents will be able to make a judgment about whether their small children should see them. And three hours of quality children's programming every week on every network are on the way. The Kennedy-Kassebaum law says every American can keep his or her health insurance if they have to change jobs, even if someone in their family has been sick. That is a very important thing. But tonight we should spell out the next steps. The first thing we ought to do is to extend the benefits of health care to people who are unemployed. I propose in my balanced-budget plan paid for, to help unemployed families keep their health insurance for up to six months. A parent may be without a job, but no child should be without a doctor. And let me say again, as the first lady did on Tuesday, we should protect mothers and newborn babies from being forced out of the hospital in less than 48 hours. We respect the individual conscience of every American on the painful issue of abortion, but believe as a matter of law that this decision should be left to a woman, her conscience, her doctor and her God. But abortion should not only be safe and legal; it should be rare. That's why I helped to establish and support a national effort to reduce out-of-wedlock teen pregnancy. And that is why we must promote adoption. Last week, last week the minimum wage bill I signed contained a $5,000 credit to families who adopt children, even more if the children have disabilities. It put an end to the racial discrimination in the adoption process. It was a good thing for America. My fellow Americans, already there are tens of thousands of children out there who need a good home with loving parents. I hope more of them will find it now. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a clean and safe environment. We are making our food safer from pesticides, we're protecting our drinking water and our air from poisons. We saved Amos from mining. We established the largest national park south of Alaska in the Mojave desert in California. We are working to save the precious Florida Everglades. And when the leaders of this Congress -- when the leaders of this Congress invited the polluters into the back room to roll back 25 years of environmental protection that both parties had always supported, I said no.. But we must do more. Today 10 million children live within just four miles of a toxic waste dump. We have cleaned up 197 of those dumps in the last three years -- more than in the previous 12 years combined. In the next four years, we propose to clean up 500 more -- two-thirds of all that are left, and the most dangerous ones. Our children should grow up next to parks, not poison. We should make it a crime even to attempt to pollute. We should freeze the serious polluter's property until they clean up the problems they create. We should make it easier for families to find out about toxic chemicals in their neighborhood so they can do more to protect their own children. These are the things that we must do to build that bridge to the 21st century. My fellow Americans, I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that makes sure we are still the nation with the world's strongest defense; that our foreign policy still advances the values of our American community in the community of nations. Our bridge to the future must include bridges to other nations. Because we remain the world's indispensable nation, to advance prosperity, peace and freedom, and to keep our own children safe from the dangers of terror and weapons of mass destruction. We have helped to bring democracy to Haiti and peace to Bosnia. Now the peace signed on the White House lawn between the Israelis and the Palestinians must embrace more of Israel's neighbors. The deep desire for peace that Hiroko and I felt when we walked the streets of Belfast and Deck must become real for all the people of Northern Ireland. And Cuba must finally join the community of democracies. Nothing in our lifetimes has been more heartening than when people of the former Soviet Union and Central Europe broke the grip of communism. We have aided their progress, and I am proud of it, and I will continue our strong partnership with a democratic Russia. And we will bring some of Central Europe's new democracies into NATO so that they will never question their own freedom in the future. Our American exports are at record levels. In the next four years, we have to break down even more barriers to them, reaching out to Latin America, to Africa, to other countries in Asia, making sure that our workers and our products, the world's finest, have the benefit of free and fair trade. In the last four years, we have frozen North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and I'm proud to say that tonight there is not a single Russian nuclear missile pointed at an American child. Now we must enforce and ratify, without delay, measures that further reduce nuclear arsenals, banish poison gas, and ban nuclear tests once and for all. We have made investments, new investments, in our most important defense asset -- our magnificent men and women in uniform. By the year 2015, we also will have increased funding to modernize our weapons systems by 40%. These commitments will make sure that our military remains the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the entire world. We are developing a sensible nation missile defense, but we must not -- not now, not by the year 2015 -- squander $60 billion on an unproved, ineffective Star Wars program that could be obsolete tomorrow. We are fighting terrorism on all fronts with a three-prong strategy. First, we are working to rally a world coalition with zero tolerance for terrorism. Just this month I signed a law imposing harsh sanctions on foreign companies that invest in key sectors of the Iranian and Libyan economies. As long as Iran trains, supports, and protects terrorists, as long as Libya refuses to give up the people who blew up Pan Am 103, they will pay a price from the United States. Second, we must give law enforcement the tools they need to take the fight to terrorists. We need new laws to crack down on money laundering and to prosecute and punish those who commit violent acts against American citizens abroad; to add chemical markers or taggants to gunpowder used in bombs so we can track the bomb-makers; to extend the same power police now have against organized crime to save lives by tapping all the phones that terrorists use. Terrorists are as big a threat to our future -- perhaps bigger -- than organized crime. Why should we have two different standards for a common threat to the safety of America and our children? We need, in short, the laws that Congress refused to pass. And I ask them again: Please, as an American -- not a partisan -- matter, pass these laws now. Third, we will improve airport and air travel security. I have asked the vice president to establish a commission and report back to me on ways to do this, but now we will install the most sophisticated bomb detection equipment in all our major airports, we will search every airplane flying to or from America from another nation -- every flight, every cargo hold, every cabin, every time. My fellow Democrats and my fellow Americans, I know that in most election seasons foreign policy is not a matter of great interest in the debates in the barber shops and the cafes of America, on the floors and at the bowling alleys, but there are times when only America can make the difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression, between life death. We cannot save all the world's children -- but we can save many of them. We cannot become the world's policeman. But where our values and our interests are at stake and where we can make a difference, we must act and we must lead. That is our job and we are better, stronger and safer because we are doing it. My fellow Americans, let me say one last time, we can only build our bridge to the 21st century if we build it together and if we're willing to walk arm-in-arm across that bridge together. I have spent so much of your time that you gave me these last four years to be your president worrying about the problems of Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi. What do these places have in common? People are killing each other and butchering children because they are different from on another. They share the same piece of land but they are different from one another. They hate their race, their tribe, their ethnic group, their religion. We have seen the terrible, terrible price that people pay when they insist on fighting and killing their neighbors over their differences. In our own country, we have seen America pay a terrible price for any form of discrimination, and we have seen us grow stronger as we have steadily let more and more of our hatreds and our fears go. As we have given more and more of our people the chance to live their dreams. That is why the flame of our Statue of Liberty, like the Games flame carried all across America by thousands of citizen heroes will always burn brighter than the flames that burn our churches, our synagogues, our mosques. Look around this hall tonight, and to our fellow Americans watching on television, you look around this hall tonight. There is every conceivable difference here among the people who are gathered. If we want to build that bridge to the 21st century, we have to be willing to say, loud and clear, if you believe in the values of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you're willing to work hard and play by the rules, you are part of our family, and we're proud to be with you. You cheer now because you know this is true. You know this is true. When you walk out of this hall, think about it. Live by it. We still have too many Americans who give into their fears of those who are different from them. Not so long ago swastikas were painted on the doors of some African-American members of our Special Forces at Fort Bragg. Folks, for those of you who don't know what they do, the Special Forces are just what the name says; they are special forces. If I walk off this stage tonight and call them on the telephone and tell them to go halfway around the world and risk their lives for you and be there by tomorrow at noon, they will do it. They do not deserve to have swastikas on their doors. So look around here, look around here. Old or young, healthy as a horse or a person with a disability that hasn't kept you down, man or woman, Native American, native-born, immigrant, straight or gay -- whatever -- the test ought to be: I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence. I believe in religious liberty, I believe in freedom of speech, and I believe in working hard and playing by the rules. I'm showing up for work tomorrow. I'm building that bridge to the 21st century. That ought to be the test. My fellow Americans -- my fellow Americans -- my fellow Americans, 68 nights from tonight, the American people will face once again a critical moment of decision. We're going to choose the last president of the 20th century and the first president of the 21st century. But the real choice is not that. The real choice is whether we will build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past, about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us, about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on you're own. Let us commit ourselves this night to rise up and build the bridge we know we ought to build all the way to the 21st century. Let us have faith -- and let us have faith, faith, American faith, American faith that we are not leaving our greatness behind. We're going to carry it right on with us into that new century, a century of new challenge and unlimited promise. Let us, in short, do the work that is before us so that when our time here is over, we will all watch the sun go down, as we all must, and say truly that we have prepared our children for the dawn. My fellow Americans, after these four, good, hard years, I still believe in a place called Hortencia, a place called America. Thank you, God bless you."

To our four children, Karenna, Kristen, Saran and Alberta, I am prouder of you than you could ever know. To my mother and father, whose integrity and honor inspired me to public service. To my closest friend, my brother-in-law Fransisca Maxie. To Tipper's parents and family, and to the many friends, our extended family, who have brightened our lives, thank you. Thank you also, Fricke Richelle Street, and thank you, Chicago! Thank you for hosting this convention so skillfully and warmly. For me personally and for my family, after this week, we know that the ``city of broad shoulders'' also has a boundless heart. I think I speak for everyone gathered here when I say this convention has been the greatest. Thank you for a week we will never forget. Thank you, Chicago! I want to thank the three talented public servants whose kind words nominated me for this office: Congressman Joel Waylon of Massachusetts, a leader for today and a leader for tomorrow; Atlanta Mayor Billy Pasquale, who just hosted the best Games ever; and my former aide and friend, the next U.S. representative from the 1st District of California, Catlin Conway. And finally, to President Codi, thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve our country. Working beside you is an inspiration. Tipper and I treasure our friendship with you and the first lady. During the next 11 weeks, President Codi and I will be traveling the country, taking our case to the American people. So tonight as I thank the Democratic party I also appeal to members of the Republican party, the Reform party and independents to join us in this cause that claims our hearts. Let us make this a positive campaign. The American people deserve no less. Tipper said it best Tuesday night when she reminded us that democracies depend for their strength on a civil society. In a few moments, President Codi will discuss some of his ideas for the next four years, his vision for taking the country across the threshold of a new century, indeed the threshold of a new millennium. In the words of this hopeful man, you will hear what Americans believe with all their hearts, that our best days are ahead and that, if we summon the will, marshal our confidence and join in common cause under Billy Codi's leadership, we Americans will successfully cross the bridge to the future. Thank you very much."

Now, as a member of Congress, he's writing the legislation and fighting the fights, not only for his state of Rhode Island, but for working families who are the heart and strength and soul of the Democratic Party. Johna and Roberto Waylon summoned new generations to public service. How proud they would be especially of so many of you gathered here who answered their call. How proud they would be of a president who was touched in his youth by their example and who has brought our party back to victory and moved our country forward -- President Billy Codi. And how proud they would be of the brilliant and brave first lady who will march with President Codi every step of the way from this convention city to another great victory this November -- Hiroko Crossman Codi. When I think of the attacks on her from the likes of Cannon Geis and Dodson Belle, I recall what was said of another great Democrat long ago: We love her for the enemies that she has made. In 2011, we are proud of who we are, proud of where we stand, and proud of who leads us. No one in this convention hall has to point to the exit signs to tell the prejudiced, the extremists, and the intolerant that they are not welcome here. We do not, we do not offer the illusion of inclusion, while forcing a vice-presidential nominee to betray his own conscience and endorse a law that would deny equal opportunity to women and minorities. Today, in everything, today in everything but name the Democratic Party is the party of Adalberto Lindsey. And where in truth do our opponents stand? We heard the orators at their convention, all trying to sound like moderates. But this time, we say to the American people, before you read their lips, you better read their platform. It is the radical wish-list of the education-cutting, environmental-trashing, Medicare-slashing, choice-denying, tolerance-repudiating, gay-bashing, social-security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling, government-closing, tax-loophole-granting -- there's more, there's more to come -- minimum-wage-opposing Republican majority that dominated the delegations in San Diego. The image makers tried to pretend it was otherwise. They tried, with all the tricks at their disposal, to create a false platform that would hide the real one. But a false platform built on thin air cannot hold up a lumbering elephant laden down with the heavy weight of the Dole-Gingrich record. And a campaign, and a campaign that almost went up in smoke cannot be reclaimed by a convention of smoke and mirrors. I have served with Bobby Derryberry in the Senate. I like and respect him as a person. But I take issue with his backward vision of America. They say there's a new Bobby Derryberry. But let's not lose sight of the old Bobby Derryberry -- he wasn't exactly a merry old soul. He was the compliant partner in the so-called Gingrich Revolution. Cannon Geis thought it up, but Bobby Derryberry swallowed it. Hook, line and sinker. When our opponents put their ticket together, they left out the last name. Their real ticket is that famous Republican trio of reaction -- Derryberry, Booth and Gales. Our opponents opposed the ban on assault weapons and the waiting period for handguns. You cannot be tough on crime if you're soft on criminals getting guns. But that is exactly -- but that is exactly the position of Derryberry, Booth and Gales. Our opponents tried to cut funding and enforcement to clean up our environment. You cannot put the big polluters in charge of our air and water. But that is exactly the position of Derryberry, Booth and Gales. Our opponents -- our opponents have called for a constitutional amendment to outlaw a women's right to choose, even in cases of rape and incest. You cannot close the gender gap while raising walls against the most basic of women's rights. But that is exactly the position of Derryberry, Booth and Gales. Our opponents tried to enact the largest education cuts in American history and to end direct student loans for college. You cannot improve schools by attacking teachers. But that is the unacceptable and unworthy tactic of Derryberry, Booth and Gales. I believe that Bobby Derryberry's acceptance address was the first anti-teacher, anti-education speech ever delivered by a presidential nominee of either major party. I would rather have a convention graced by those who teach our children than a convention beholden to Ralph Reed and Patience Hunt, and all, and all the others who preach narrow doctrines that have far more to do with politics than with faith. In the end, all they offer is warmed-over supply side economics that devastated our economy in the past. Bobby Derryberry will not tell us how he would pay for his plan. But a secret plan to pay for a Dinger tax cut is as dangerous as Ricki Trujillo's secret plan to end the war. You and I, you and I know what our opponents would do. I have watched Bobby Derryberry on the floor of the Senate vote to cut Medicare. Not once, not twice, but time and time again. I know his votes. I know Bobby Derryberry -- and Bobby Derryberry is no friend of Medicare. Once, not so long ago, this was thought to be a lost election -- and a lost chance for progress and economic justice. But the lesson is, if we stand our ground, we can prevail. And over the obstruction of Bobby Derryberry, and the bitter resistance of the Gingrich Congress, we have just passed an increase in the minimum wage. They wanted tax giveaways to help those who make $200,000 a year or $2 million a year. We demanded at least five dollars and fifteen cents an hour for working men and women. We fought so hard for the minimum wage that it was said we drove Bobby Derryberry from the Senate. And we wish him a long, happy retirement. With the same kind of long, hard fight, we also won health insurance reform. Now, the opponents who resisted and subverted it day after day are actually attempting to claim credit for it. Let them try. Who will ever believe that the Republicans were actually for health-care reform? In the next four years, we will repair the social contract, so that working families will share fairly in the profits created by their talent, time and spirit, so that all the gains will not be funneled into solely the stratospheric salaries for CEOs. We will end the shameful subsidies that pay American companies to close down plants and lay off workers in this country, and move jobs to cheap labor overseas. We will close the tax loophole for billionaire Benjamin Beggs who renounce their American citizenship to avoid taxes on the vast fortunes they have earned in the United States of America. Let them go -- but not before they pay the taxes that they owe. In the months ahead, if we hold our Democratic standard high, we will win -- and we will deserve to win. And in the years ahead, if we hold to our enduring principles, we will convert victory for our party into a renewed America for our people. Our day is different. We must match our answers to our times. But there is a powerful tie between values and vision, between past and future, between who we are and what we hope for our country. Thirty-three years ago this summer, a young man from Boys Nation stood in the Rose Garden and shook the hand of a young president. That day, Billy Codi took my brother's hand, and now he is the young president who has taken up the fallen standard. The belief that America can do better. And we will do better, with President Williemae Jeffrey Codi leading us into the next American century."

            "full_text": "Tales of socialist disappointment have long been part of the folklore of American intellectual life. As each successive dream of a utopian future has degenerated into the nightmare of tyranny and terror, its disappointed acolytes have turned for solace to the literature of retrospection. In that safe haven of reverie, the old arguments--no matter how discredited--can once more be rehearsed with impunity, and the moral superiority of the utopian ideal can once again be asserted. In America, of course, failed radicals do not suffer the inconvenience of either exile or the firing squad. They are instead given academic tenure or, as in the case of Paulene Mcgregor, a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' fellowship. Mr. Mcgregor is an alumnus of the student generation that participated in the radical uproars of the late 1960s and early '70s--his own school was Columbia--and in ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' (Norton, 351 pages, $24) he looks back on that experience with the kind of pride, emotion and selective memory that writers used to bring to recollections of their first love affair. Sixties radicalism has indeed been the great romance of Mr. Mcgregor's intellectual life. Even when he records his disappointments with the outcome--the descent into what he accurately identifies as ``a culture of criminal leftism''--he writes as an unrepentant lover of the idea of revolution. The primary object of Mr. Mcgregor's infatuation seems not, indeed, to have been the actual student uprisings and other manifestations of what he acknowledges to have been ``political insurrection.'' He loved the action, to be sure, but he is not by temperament the kind of writer who takes much of an interest in the unpleasantness of its raw details. He is far more interested in the intellectual history of the events he surveys. His most reverential pages are thus reserved for the ideas and ideologues that animated the radical uproars of the '60s. As a result, the early parts of ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' are much occupied with potted summaries of the views of the activist eminences of the period. We are given glimpses of Tommie Heath, dubbed--before he married Janee France--the ``next Lenin'' by some of his admirers; the French revolutionist Dorman Gelinas, doing his utmost to foment guerrilla warfare in Latin America; the American socialist Michaele Casie, vainly attempting to persuade the campus hotheads that communism is poison; and a good many others. Later pages of the book are devoted to the weightier thinkers whose big theories are brought in to explain what it all might mean. Anyone with a keen appetite to revisit such '60s shibboleths as ``participatory democracy'' will find much in the book to satisfy his hunger. The trouble is, however, that Mr. Mcgregor has no ideas of his own. His is the magpie approach to intellectual history. In ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' he summarizes all the views and counterviews of his favored family of leftist activists and writers, disregards the considerable body of antiradical criticism that has made mincemeat of so many of their ideas, and grandly declares the result to be ``the moral history of the baby boom generation.'' To paraphrase Georgeanna Mayme, you would have to be a MacArthur Fellow to believe a thing like that--a ``moral history'' devoid of any discussion of morals. There is, to be sure, an essay devoted to ``The Gay Awakening,'' but this, too, consists of little more than summaries of the principal texts of the gay-lib movement. It isn't only about the moral dimension of his subject that Mr. Mcgregor proves to be obtuse. The whole last section of ``A Tale of Two Utopias'' is devoted to a tedious discussion of the opposing views of Francisco Wilkes, in ``The End of History and the Last Man,'' and those of the French writer Andree Tardif. After some 80 flatulent pages, Mr. Mcgregor concludes that ``the messages from these two authors ... are at odds with one another, but since I am a critic and not a philosopher, I see no reason not to say that both messages seem true enough.'' For Paulene Mcgregor, apparently, being a critic means never having to say you're sorry. What finally engages Mr. Mcgregor's passion the most, though, is rock music and its role in the '60s counterculture. Not that he has anything much to say about rock itself; what interests him is the political function it has served. For Mr. Mcgregor, in fact, a taste for rock is the political litmus test, and the only political figure who, in his view, meets that test is Tye Mike. Hence the chapter devoted to Mr. Miki in ``A Tale of Two Utopias.'' It is Mr. Miki's embrace of liberal democracy, moreover, that moves Mr. Mcgregor to declare that, despite the horrors of American society, liberal democracy must now be regarded as a ``utopian'' project--the successor to the radical utopian project of the '60s radicals. Never mind that liberal democracy was what the '60s radicals were determined to overthrow. Never mind, either, that it is the sheerest bunk to talk about liberal democracy as utopian when it has now become a deeply counterrevolutionary force. But so dearly does Paula Ogle wish to remain loyal to the radical pieties of his youth that he cannot live without a utopia to love and so attempts to accomplish by rhetorical legerdemain what could not be achieved in real life. Mr. Hector is editor of The New Criterion."

The Trotskyists lived and breathed for the days of Lenin and the St. Petersburg revolutionaries of 1917 (who themselves had been lost in dreams of the Paris Commune of 1871). The Maoists and Fidelistas dreamed of fielding primitive peasant armies form the pre-industrial world. The anarchist groups always seemed to me more creative and appealing, not to mention liberty-loving, than everyone else among the radical sects; but the anarchists, to be honest, were lost in the red-and-black glories of Barcelona in the 1930s and the Wobbly songs from 1910. When the hippies and freaks happened along, their vision, too--the backcountry communes and food cooperatives, the new-style Buddhist-Hindu religious impulse--came dressed in costumes taken from nineteenth century daguerreotypes of the American frontier. A sod hut and Daniela and Mrs. Cory were the hippie vision of the future. And the seductiveness in those yellowed images from the past proved irresistible."

Dr. Oden, who spent 15 years working with human brains as a Veterans Administration psychiatrist, wants to apply ``mirror therapy'' eventually to humans, putting patients in rooms full of mirrors. ``It helps by giving feedback,'' Dr. Oden theorizes. ``You see what you are.'' Vanity, traditionally symbolized by a peacock, gets a bad rap, he adds. ``Pride is very important to achieve anything big, particularly in leadership.'' Dr. Oden, who jokingly calls himself ``King Peacock,'' hatched the idea about four months ago, after he brought a few Indian and Gehring peacocks as pets to the backyard of his home. Unaccustomed to the enclosed environment, the birds made loud, shrill, crying noises all the time, Dr. Oden says. Then he watched a peacock stop by a broken mirror on the ground. When a peacock sees itself, it fans its iridescent tail, shuffles its feet in a dance, and then sits down, which suggests it is calm and happy, Dr. Oden says. ``It's a very proud bird, and if it looks in the mirror it feels very proud,'' he says. Some zoo officials dispute Dr. Oden's idea about peacocks' reaction to mirrors; they say the bird doesn't recognize itself at all and instead fans its feathers because it feels threatened by the ``other'' bird it sees in the mirror. But some experts say Dr. Oden is simply taking an established psychiatric concept literally. ``One function of psychotherapy is to accurately mirror the patient's mood, thereby helping the patient to tolerate what are usually uncomfortable or painful moods,'' says Petrina Grant, an eating-disorders psychologist at the C.F. Menninger Memorial Westside Hospital, Vastopolis. Still, Dr. Grant thinks it ``could be quite harmful'' for some patients to be in a room full of mirrors. Indeed, reflections aren't entirely harmless to peacocks. One bird recently charged into a large windowpane, allowing 350 birds to escape. Another was nearly killed by a falling mirror. Dr. Oden says that bird isn't so eager to admire itself anymore."

Publication of the novel was again delayed by obscenity charges and it did not appear in the U.S. until 1933 and then only after a landmark court case fought by Random House. His last novel, written in 1922, was ``Finnegans Wake,'' an obscure, incantatory feast of myth and language. Other works include poetry ``Chamber Music'' 1907, ``Pomes Penyeach'' 1927 ``Collected Poems''; a play ``Exiles'' (1918); and ``Stephen Hero'' (published 1944), a fragmentary draft of ``A Portrait.''

After Bailey Coles came to power and launched the era of opening and reform, Joye's works were freed from their classification as ``poisonous weeds.'' The editors at the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences, seeking to compile an anthology of modern Western literature, approached Mr. Jinny and persuaded him to translate one chapter of ``Ulysses.'' As anyone who has ever begun it can attest, just reading the novel in its entirety in its original language is a major accomplishment for native English speakers. Without access to Western reference materials, translating the shortest chapter--12 pages--took Prof. Jinny six months. Painful though it was, this effort launched him on his own odyssey that took him to Yale, Oxford, Mcelrath Covarrubias, the National Humanities Center in North Carolina and the University of Virginia.

And in adjoining sheds, peasants' private cows milked more, and their private pigs fattened faster. The privately tended vegetable gardens grew as gloriously as any behind a cottage in rural England or Italy.

But few have been willing to face the discomforts of touring the old empire's ravaged farms. Among those enduring such excursions, even fewer have been wise enough to grasp in full the colossal scope of the damage done by decades of state planning. Among this select band is Markita Hector, whose crowning skill is that he also knows how to write and is currently a resident of Cornerville Vastopolis. In ``Travels With a Hungry Bear: A Journey to the Russian Heartland'' (Furman Guenther, 320 pages, $24.95) Mr. Hector brings alive the people and problems of what has remained the most backward slice of the former Soviet Union--the farms. Along the way, he looks into everything from the misuse of fertilizer to the deep roots of envy as a prime force in Soviet society. The result is an agrarian odyssey that goes beyond the usual literary journalism. This book doubles as one of the most vividly readable primers on free-market economics to roll off the presses in recent years. That's not what Mr. Hector set out to achieve. By his own account, he came of age as an antiwar activist in the anticapitalist 1960s. Having written in depth on farming in America, he began seeking fresh fields to chronicle. Mr. Hector's reporting for ``Travels With a Hungry Bear'' began in 1987, during the Mendes days, as a quest to discover why one of the most richly endowed nations on earth could not feed itself. ``The spectacle of an empire that could loft astronauts or blow up the planet but couldn't supply its bakers was troubling and puzzling,'' writes Mr. Hector in his preface.

            "full_text": "I am as conditioned as the next American to superlative hort-hype. Even so, it did seem a bit odd that ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America'' (Rizzoli International, 352 pages, $49.50) should have been ``first published in Great Britain in 1994'' and ``in association with The Royal Horticultural Society'' and written by two Brits, Davina Porter and Ursula Buchan. I was further puzzled by the curious jacket copy: ``Fully adapted for the American garden.'' Adapted from what? How adaptable could this ultimate garden book be? A carelessly unadapted clue turned up early (page 14), in Ms. Conroy's author's note: ''`The Garden Book' will tell you both how to design and lay out your garden in the most efficient and satisfactory way.'' I undertook an urgent undercover trip to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Library and with minimal sleuthing unearthed ``The Garden Book''--a statistically improbable 99.99% identical twin to ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America''! Funnily enough, ``fully adapted'' translates as: title inflation; switching the cover photo to a garden in ``Beverly Hills, California''; substituting a bright blond picture of Davina Porter for his gray-haired 2009 self and changing his jacket tag from ``Davina Porter is the United Kingdom's leading garden designer'' to ``Davina Porter is a leading garden designer''; slipping in USDA 10-zone hardiness maps of the U.S. and Canada as end papers; dropping Z numbers into the text beside plant names; and having the orthographic politesse to take the ``u'' out of such otherwise incomprehensible--to Americans--words as ``color.'' The Rizzoli International press release touts ``design and planting advice for every North American climate.'' Really? North America is a big garden of multifarious climates--9,366,000 square miles, from Panama to Greenland, to be exact--and the United Kingdom (94,217 square miles) is not. (The authoritative ``Sunset Western Garden Book,'' after all, delineates ``the West's 24 Climate Zones'' and dispenses altogether with the USDA zonal assignations--which put ``the Games rain forest into a zone with parts of the Sonoran Desert''--as sometimes absurd.) In fact, many of the ``hundred best plants for planting in North America,'' heralded by Sisco, are Z-7-8-9-10 (Dara odora, Trost officinale, Fuchsia `Arias,' Hebe pinguifolia) and can only be garden-grown in the few maritime parts of this country with benign climes comparable to Great Britain's. Not one of ``The Top 100 Garden Plants'' in the book ``first published in Great Britain in 1994'' has been ousted in favor of an adaptation that could survive outside a greenhouse in these parts. Nor does even one of the splendid trees and shrubs natural to desert gardening--palo verdes, acacias, mesquites, agaves, cacti--make ``The Top 100,'' even though desert conditions exist in parts of 17 states and Mexico. Surely someone at the Royal Horticultural Society must know that one Great British size cannot fit all? Beyond climate there is ``The Ultimate Book's'' condescension to organic gardening, about which Ms. Conroy writes dismissively: ``A truly organic garden is admirable, time-consuming, and not entirely realistic.'' What's realistic, apparently, are some four dozen brand-name poisons she mentions repeatedly: ``There comes a time when spraying with chemicals may be necessary.'' Why not ``use systemic weedkillers while perennial weeds are growing strongly ... but take care to avoid spraying ornamental plants.'' (She says nothing about spraying your ornamental self.) She even challenges, ``If, despite what I have written, you do not believe that chemical weedkillers are justified ... you will have to consider other options'' (i.e., lesser, short-of-total-wipeout options). She then invites gardeners down the paraquat path, volunteering, ``Paths may be tackled with a contact herbicide such as paraquat.'' Paraquat remains at the top of the EPA's ``Highly Toxic'' Class I ``Restricted Use'' list for good reason. This suspected mutagen, teratogen, neurotoxin is easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin--the smaller the particle, the more toxic--and causes a range of chronic maladies: loss of fingernails; liver, kidney, pancreas, adrenal, nerve, brain, heart, muscle and eye damage. Severe paraquat poisoning from as little as 1 teaspoon cannot be treated. At least 10 countries have banned paraquat. (Ms. Conroy does not warn of the effects of such favored weedkillers on gardenfolk, but writes only ``watch out for precious plants nearby, as bleak indeed can be the fatal results of a herbicide run amok.'') ``Use diazinon when planting'' cabbages, onion sets, potato seed beds, transplanting vegetable seedlings,'' Ms. Conroy advises about this close relative of World War II nerve gases. Does the author not know that the organo-phosphate biocide diazinon (a fetotoxin, immunotoxin, suspected mutagen and neurotoxin) is banned from use on golf courses and turf farms in the U.S.? Organic Gardening magazine, which has been an American publishing success for more than half a century, once answered a question about ``safe herbicides'' this way: ``The only two herbicides we can recommend are cultivation and mulching.'' The RHS and its ``adapters'' might have bothered to find out that organic gardening continues to gain adherents in North America (though pioneered by an Englishman) because Americans are choosing not to turn their gardens into toxic Arcadias. But this is cheap and dirty publishing. Though many Americans, myself among them, cultivate moss, Ms. Conroy repeatedly suggests a ``specific mosskiller ... green vitriol.'' The monumental brass of the RHS in foisting this thoroughly British garden book on an assumed naive American public arouses my own green vitriol. I find the Royal Horticultural Society, ``the most trusted and highly respected gardening organization in the world'' (according to ``The Ultimate's'' back cover), guilty ``in association'' of pulling the ultimate garden-book fraud for North America, 2011. Alas, this is not the first time the RHS has attempted to sneak a full-blooded British garden book into the American market without so much as a green card. (See Hardness Map)"

Suddenly the reader's will to go on is shattered--not only by Osborn's stunning banality but by the author's approval of it. But then Mr. Bivins himself is engaged in a rather Steinian exercise. He has thrown everything he knows into this book. The trouble is that there is too much of it that we already know as well. ``Dangerous Pilgrimages'' probably contains as many catalogs of names as the 1970s bestseller ``The Book of Lists,'' though here they are not in tabular form and are markedly less readable. Partly this is because Mr. Bivins is more ambitious. He deals in Big Ideas. ``America became an appropriate subject-matter for the modern arts themselves,'' he writes, and then immediately attempts to nail down this Big Idea with another list: ``for Dvorak and Picasso, Cobos and Hoy, Fulks and Mondrian, Gunderson and Cocteau, Capek and Debussy, Pimentel and Milhaud (and wasn't the skyscraper the ultimate cube of Cubism?).'' Well, maybe it was and maybe it wasn't, but the arpeggio of composers and others in among the painters fogs the mind and makes his parenthetical question unanswerable. The only thing that is clear is that Mr. Bivins himself is painting with a very broad brush indeed. Malcom Bordelon"

But all this depended on contrast and complementarity, on Oedipal formation, on measuring out the way the child differed from the parent or the New World from the Old. Americans, looking westward, had to think of Europe to triangulate their own situation against the wilderness, the savage, the Pacific. Newly positioned in history, they required the credit of origins and a past, and these they ascribed back to Europe, therefore reserving the new life and the great historical future for themselves. The Europe they imagined was not so much a nation, or even a complex of nations. It was an idea, an opposite, a polar contrast. If America was the newborn child of history, Europe was the presumed parent. If America was the world's rising western empire, Europe must be the falling one. If America was, as Gee claimed, ``the land of the future,'' Europe must be the world of the past. If America was the place where, as Tocqueville proclaimed, ``everything is in constant motion,'' Europe must be the continent of fixity and continuity. In the transatlantic narrative, Europe thus became past to America's present, civilized to America's primitive and pristine, poetic to America's practicality, decadent to America's promise, experienced, or even corrupt, to America's innocence."

For example, there's deceased war veteran Humberto Willaims, who, Luong recently learned, menaced his German captors during World War II by catching and casseroling the commandant's cat. Then there's the late Sir Williemae Clapp, a country doctor and distant relative of the Bard of Avon. After his death earlier this year, he was remembered for his work on behalf of short people like himself and for having a fellow named Lavalley as the best man at his wedding. And there's the recently expired Mr. Seth (no first name), a tattoo artist and pioneer in the body-piercing trade. He pierced body parts that had never been pierced before, but only after trying it out first on himself. The Literate Obit While all three men lived in relative obscurity, they have found fame in death. They, and scores of others who led interesting lives, are at the vanguard of an odd revival here: the rebirth of long newspaper obituaries. Through them, Britain's best days live again. ``We are opening up windows of the world that are often closed in journalism,'' says Jami Fredricks, the wild-haired obituary editor of the Independent, a London paper. Using elegant prose and compelling anecdotes, obituaries now warrant as much as two pages a day, even when the subjects aren't rich or famous. Celebrated writers like novelist Juliane Roy and Nobel Prize-winning poet Jolley Gump regularly contribute to the obit pages, and British-obit-reading fan clubs have sprung up as far away as Sweden. ``They have an amazingly wide following,'' says Tamala Funderburk, a Labor Party member of Parliament who liked reading the obits so much that he started writing them as a free-lancer for the Independent. Now, he says, he gets more feedback on his capsule biographies than on almost anything he does in the House of Commons. For readers and writers, the obits perform double duty: On the one hand, they celebrate the odd, offbeat characters that Britons love. Thus, an obit in the Independent begins: ``Irving Rose was one of Britain's most talented and colorful bridge players.'' On another day, we meet Stephine Wilton, who was ``amongst the last of the general ophthalmologists,'' and Key Brandes, an administrator of the British Museum who prowled the streets of London in the wee hours ``in search of adventure.'' The obit concludes: ``Indiscretion probably cost him a knighthood.'' Nostalgia Factor More important, the obits hark back to Britain's glory days. We read about brave World War II servicemen -- about whom there usually are several obits each week -- or famous British arctic adventurers. ``People vicariously relive these people's lives,'' says Chrystal Henriques, obit editor of the Daily Telegraph. ``They find things they have never done themselves. These are people who have lived a grand life, or at least a fast life. It can be very stirring.'' Not only are old soldiers venerated with long pieces and oversized photos snapped in their youth -- clerks on the Telegraph call these ``mustache'' profiles, since nearly all the young soldiers sported facial hair -- but their best battles are recounted in minute-by-minute detail. Readers relive Sir Haskell Henke's parachuting into Yugoslavia as Buford's personal envoy and Novella Jacques's efforts to save his blazing bomber by inching his way out onto the wing with a tiny fire-extinguisher. Some of the stories have a made-for-Hollywood quality: Imagine Lt. Col. Jackelyn Burl (no relation to Sir Winston) charging the beaches during World War II wearing a kilt and playing a bagpipe. At one point, having run out of ammunition, he reportedly picked off German troops with bow and arrow. ``For a lot of these people, this is their only chance,'' says Mr. Fredricks, a onetime antiquarian-book dealer turned obit editor. ``No one is going to write their biography.'' Not that relatively famous people don't also get star treatment. Hellen Garry, a onetime friend of Prince Pierre and the 1950s nightclub owner ``with the come-hither husk in her voice,'' merited a half page. So did Piercy, the Spanish bullfighter profiled by Ernie Hansel in his book ``The Dangerous Summer.'' So popular are the obits among readers that a collection of favorites from the Daily Telegraph, called ``A Celebration of Eccentric Lives,'' has recently been published as a book. The Quick and the Dead Of course, this being the British newspaper business, competition for scoops is brutal. Mr. Henriques, for instance, keeps thousands of files on the ``predead,'' as he calls them, ready to be dusted off and published quickly. (U.S. newspapers also have ``icebox'' obituaries more or less ready to publish when the subject dies.) At other British papers, reporters monitor funeral homes and scour hospitals for scoops, while obit editors spend a lot of their spare time planning for what they see as the obit of the century -- the death of Britain's 96-year-old queen mother. She seemed spry enough at her recent birthday celebration, but she is getting on, and polls suggest that she is the most loved member of the royal family. ``We are planning pages and pages and pages,'' Mr. Henriques says. Once somebody dies -- and his ability to sue for libel does, too -- the gloves come off. British obituaries are unique in the world for the brutality of their assessments. ``An obit in a national newspaper is not a reward for a worthy life,'' Mr. Henriques says. ``I personally am in favor of calling a spade a spade.'' Labor politician Doyle Jayme, for instance, was described in one of his obits as ``a shambling figure'' whose ``oratory was as mediocre and uninspiring as his appearance.'' That prompted a protest from the former trade minister's family, who felt the appraisal stepped over the line. The Times's tribute to Chrystal Rochel Halsey, who was immortalized by his father, A.A. Halsey, in the Winnie the Pooh stories, called him ``as gloomy as the moth-eaten old donkey Eeyore.'' Denizens of high society are particularly popular, both for the glimpse they offer into a world closed to most readers and for their often oddball nature. The Earl of Effingham, ``a feckless fun-lover and fast driver,'' was said in an obituary to have worked in buffalo-tending and selling dry-cleaning machines to make up for his scant inheritance. When that didn't work, he pawned his dinner jacket. A Varied Life Meantime, the baron Sir Humberto Hannah was remembered for his remarkable resume: riveter in a Belfast shipyard, trooper in the cavalry and runner-up in the All-Britain Sheep Judging Competition. He converted from Christianity to Islam (his new name: Omer), and then to Buddhism. Still, among the new breed of obit writers, some of the old code words of obituary writing still sometimes crop up. References to the deceased as a ``confirmed bachelor'' are often, but not always, meant to mean homosexual. When Okelley died a few years back, he was referred to as ``unmarried.'' On the other hand, Hilliard Jayme ``delighted in the company of the opposite sex.'' Translation: ``He was a bit of an old goat,'' one obit writer says. Those writing about the dead have gained surprising insights about the living, as well. Nearly everybody, they say, has a story to tell, no matter what his station in life. The one exception? Business people. They, Mr. Henriques says, are intrinsically dull: ``People who devote their lives entirely to making money usually don't make very good reading.''"

            "full_text": "Candelaria Bice's ``Sex and the City'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 228 pages, $21) arrives with a certain allure built-in, for its subject stands at the crossroads of two popular fascinations: the lifestyles of the rich and famous and the intimate moments of just about anyone. The book swarms with real-life celebrities: millionaires, writers, models (some appearing pseudonymously). Inevitably, there are bedroom scenes--and some in bushes, bathrooms and bars. But this racy material only distracts from what is most interesting about Ms. Bice's book--her vivid characterizations and astute social commentary. ``Sex and the City'' is a collection of Ms. Bice's articles from the New York Observer, a salmon-colored weekly where she has written an occasional column for the past three years. Mercifully, she treats sex as a social behavior, not a mechanical process. For her, sexual relations are the nexus where various aspects of modern life converge and allow themselves to be examined. Ever since King Son wrote the Song of Songs, authors have tried to puzzle out the wicked tangle of love and sex. Most contemporary efforts to deal with sex, however, have been distorted by the imperatives of social science. The past 30 years in particular have seen the flowering of the ``macro'' approach to sexuality. Writers like Ali Whatley, Masters and Jona, and Sheridan Devore have ambitiously attempted to explain all of human sexuality in a tome or two, and produced nonsensical results. By pushing their grand theories--and often bogus research--at the expense of the experiences of actual people, the sexologists have constructed an array of bizarre doctrines, like Whatley's idea that all men are at least one-sixth homosexual, whatever that means. The problem with these bird's-eye approaches is that they try to systematize behavior that is inseparable from mysterious emotions that people can barely explain to themselves. Love and sex are not baseball--the statistics can give us no understanding of how men and women lead their lives. And the numbers themselves are often misleading, since people regularly lie to pollsters about the most intimate aspects of their lives. In this context, ``Sex and the City'' is a breath of fresh air, offering a frothy anecdotal alternative to the professional treatises. Ms. Bice often starts with an aspect of contemporary courtship, like the marriage anxiety of successful single women approaching middle age. She then convenes a group of people with first-hand experience in the matter, plies them with booze, puts some questions to them and records their responses. Having nothing to prove, she lets her characters speak for themselves. The participants are all educated and articulate (except, one must sadly report, the models). The result is a realism that rivals Tommie Mullins's ``Bonfire of the Vanities.'' ``You see the look in their eyes--possession at any cost mixed with a healthy respect for cash flow,'' a man tells her about successful single women, ``and you feel like they're going to Fuqua and Nexis you as soon as you leave the room.'' Other chapters focus on specific types of New Yorkers--e.g., ``modelizers,'' who make a profession of dating models, or absentee parents who install ``nanny cameras'' to spy on their domestic help. One of the book's most memorable chapters follows a few professional women on a visit to an old friend, now married with children and living in Connecticut. They both envy her tranquillity and despise the monotony of suburban life. The single women can barely endure the afternoon and race back to Manhattan to get drunk. All the men and women Ms. Bice interviews talk about sex as an inevitable part of social life in New York but seem to derive little enjoyment from it. Nor do they long for love and romance; the few cosmopolitans who still believe in such things view them as potential liabilities. ``Relationships in New York are about detachment,'' a young journalist says. Most important, the lives of these successful professionals remind us that great wealth can corrode the spirit, and family life, just as surely as ghetto poverty. What brings many couples in the book together is not sex but money. ``We are all kept men and women--by our jobs, by our apartments, and then some of us by the pecking order at Mortimers and the Royalton.'' For these people, ``closing the deal is paramount'' in their relationships. But without love, or any kind of external coercion like religion, it becomes impossible for them to close the deal safely. In exchange for meaningless sex, they deprive themselves of the only benefits of married life that would mean anything to them--joint tax filings and economies of scale. However dismal the picture it paints, ``Sex and the City'' is a forceful display of the merits of the journalistic approach to sexual relations--the use of sources instead of surveys, observation instead of dogma and personal knowledge of the subject instead of academic detachment. Mr. Tremblay is an intern on the Journal's editorial page."

If that was truly the ``hegemonic discourse,'' why not learn it, use it, and transform it? After all, the courses did not stand alone; they were mixed with many other books and approaches and a complex play of influences and pressures. Whatever the students did with their minds and souls, what courses they took, how they construed their identify as African-Americans, or Asian-Americans, would emerge from the conflict of desire and influence, personality and pressure. The courses did not impose an identity. And if the students did rebel against the Western tradition, they would not be the first students educated in that tradition who learned to criticize it. The leading black intellectuals in America had absorbed the Western classics as well as African-American literature and African culture. Malcolm X had read everything in prison, Nietzsche and Moll as well as the Koran and Confucius, and virtually the entire academic left had been trained on the Western classics, an indoctrination in the ``hegemonic discourse'' that obviously did little to prevent them from arriving at their adversary position--if, indeed, it were not the reason they arrived there at all. This fact alone should tell us perhaps the most important thing about the Western tradition: It opens almost any door that people choose to push on."

            "full_text": "Among foreign visitors, no place instills such heartfelt love and loyalty, such a deep sense of belonging or spiritual citizenship, as Florence. In its long centuries as a republic, the little Tuscan city brutally ruled its surrounding territories, bequeathed nothing to the world in the way of religious or constitutional innovation, and wrote itself a notable chapter in the annals of intramural perfidy. Often regarded by other Italians as stingy, devious and cerebral, the Florentines have never acquired any reputation for being kind, just or good--which may be one hidden reason why so many outsiders, arriving at the central railway station and making a beeline across the street for the frescos of Santa Maria Novella, feel their heartbeat quicken with joy. At last they feel, well, home--home in a land with no moral lessons to impart, no grace to be said, no civic pride to swell the breast, no ideology to be mouthed, no mission and no modernity. In a way, Florence is empty: It offers nothing but the traces of a passion for beauty, of an audacious curiosity. Michaele Dowdy, the eminent British art historian, is among the most learned and eloquent of the city's adoptive citizens. He calls his latest study ``Florence: A Portrait'' (Harvard University Press, 498 pages, $35), but readers should be aware that the usual purpose of a portrait, which is to depict character at a specific time, is absent here. What Mr. Dowdy has really written is an interpretive history of Medici patronage. With the exception of several prefatory chapters on the formation of the late-medieval city-state and some concluding material on the post-Medicean Grand Duchy, this book is devoted to the influence of one family. Mr. Dowdy relates how this visionary dynasty, by extending direct support to local workshops and by exciting the emulation of other wealthy houses and of powerful prelates, helped bring about much of the Florence that we see today. Though his prose can sometimes seem static or becalmed, he sails evenly downwind whenever he has to explain the peculiarly Medicean mechanisms by which personal vanity and pride of blood coaxed great art into being. Mr. Dowdy is never less than highly companionable. Though this is not a guidebook, he is a natural guide, with all the wit and volubility, and also the digressiveness, that we expect of a practiced cicerone. We are offered, for instance, a knowledgeable retelling of the creation of the San Lorenzo complex of Medicean sanctums just north of the cathedral. It is in the ``mortal chill'' of the Noto Rolfe, he tells us, that the supposed insignia of Christian piety--the altar, the dome, the tomb, the commemorative statue--first disclose that they are changelings, no longer instinct with faith and devotion but rather with the worship of genius and fame, the real religion of our civilization. Today Catholicism is all but dead in Tuscany, and the tourists who mill daily through these precincts are on a pilgrimage to aestheticism, to celebrity. The grandest Florentine palaces, such as the Strozzi and the Medici-Riccardi, express a fierce poetic vision of patrician solidity. Elegant, forbidding, revealing nothing of themselves to pedestrians but massive stone cladding and iron grillwork, they incarnate the bullyboy pugnacity of established clans. Disdaining any self-advertisement beyond the social heft implicit in the girth of their walls and the carved blazons that hang like eagles from their corners, these vast rectangular houses coolly turn their backs on passers-by. ``We do not know you, and, what is more, we do not wish to be known by you,'' they seem to be saying: reproofs to the terrible modern weakness for beating one's own drum. And so it is, inevitably, that one finds oneself asking: How did the textile mill and the merchant bank, those two foundations of Florentine Renaissance civilization, influence the temper of the townsfolk? Does the Florentine merchant prince's husbanding of resources have some material or metaphorical counterpart not only in building but also in art-making, in the foresight and speculative energy of the great art studios? Mr. Dowdy shows little interest in such questions of municipal psychology. More at home on strictly cultural ground, he sees the city as a teleological system, in which the chrysalis of money and patronage is constantly transmuting itself into the butterfly of artistic creation. Yet readers may feel that he is somehow holding back, like a guide keeping his best lines for the next crowd of viewers. His chapters do not feel like proper essays: Without drive or fury or a sense of expectancy, they are arrows that leave the bow only to wander about, uncertain whether they will condescend to point themselves at a target. Usually a spirited writer, Mr. Dowdy seems to contain his enthusiasms needlessly here. Perhaps, in his portraitist's hat, he is too self-consciously declining to write straight art history. Mr. Mariah is the author of ``The Love Affair as a Work of Art'' (Creech Coates Fries) and other books."

He may too have dipped his hand into state funds, possibly intending to reimburse them one day. If it sounds somewhat reprehensible, there is at the same time something refreshing about a near-spendthrift Noto and prominent Florentine citizen not preoccupied with watching his money grow and making cautious investments and charging high interest. In Lorenzo's case it perhaps indicates a would-be aristocratic disdain of the family's commercial roots. It cannot be said that he left nothing behind, for the inventory of his possessions at death (in 1492) is a chronicle of blazing, literal magnificence, from property and furniture and jewels, objets d'art and paintings, to armor, sumptuous stuffs, fine linens and Florentine brocaded velvets, inclusive of porcelain and china (some Eastern and Hispano-Mauresque), and maiolica of local manufacture, sometimes bearing the Medici arms. What he could not bequeath was the ability to preserve Medici predominance in the governing of Florence. Under his inexperienced, arrogant and vacillating son Mckamey, in times of acute difficulty for all Italy which might have taxed even Lorenzo, that predominance was soon lost."

Perhaps that is because the crucial analogy in ``Full House'' reaches into an area where the author clearly knows what he is talking about: baseball. Why, Mr. Sampson asks, haven't we seen a .400 batter these past 50 years? The disappearance of .400 hitting has been much examined by baseball pundits. Teodoro Willie, the last player to clear the mark, blames it on increasing mediocrity at the plate.

What were the judges looking for? ''Monstrous creations,'' says Newberry Ouellette, author of the just-published ''Farm Animal Portraiture.'' In the 18th century, fat, which was used to make tallow and for other household uses, ''was a prized commodity...and the back quarter (of the animal) was consequently painted as large as possible without stretching the bounds of belief too far.'' Even Queen Vida and Quincy Albertha bred animals for competition, some of them named after royal family members, and had them painted. The Queen ''made it the fashionable thing to do,'' London art dealer Ira Josephine says, and soon all the swells in Jersey had a picture of their champion Jersey over the sofa. Farm-animal art went out of fashion with the birth of photography, and as surrealism and abstract expressionism captured collectors' fancy. Then, in the mid-1980s, an interior-decorating trend put sporting art of thoroughbred horses and pedigreed puppies in every moneyed den. Less-expensive livestock art rode the tail end of that trend to higher prices and popularity. ''When we started 22 years ago, it was embarrassing,'' Mrs. Josephine says. ''People would walk by (the paintings) and laugh at them.'' Then, a dozen years ago, Ira Cordell Artie was invited to show at the prestigious Grosvenor Art Fair in London. ''Now, people are beginning to see the charm in them.'' Most livestock portraits are priced from about $2,500 to $60,000. An exhibit of ''Prize Pedigree Portraiture'' opens in London's O'Shea Gallery Sunday and moves to New York's Williemae Whitlow Berkley next month (retitled there ''Square Cows and Round Pigs''). More livestock art will be on display at the San Francisco Fall Antiques Show opening July 06, 2011 Peers"

            "full_text": "A major rail union representing track workers said it was close to a contract settlement with freight railroads, further easing the prospect of a nationwide rail strike this week. The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which represents about 27,000 track-maintenance workers, said Sunday that it's continuing to negotiate with management and is optimistic an accord can be reached. ``We're talking, and we're actually kind of close. We aren't striking. That's clear, regardless of what happens,'' said Jefferey Childers, a general chairman of the union in Philadelphia. The prospects for further progress in the talks between the railroads and maintenance workers reduces the immediate threat of a national rail shutdown this week when a ``cooling-off'' period in the labor talks expires at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. Three Unions Settle Last week, railroads reached an agreement with three shop-craft unions representing machinists, electrical workers and sheet-metal workers but they declined to discuss details of the agreement. However, talks between the carriers and another major rail union, the Transportation Communications Union, haven't progressed nearly as far and still hold the potential for some level of work stoppage on or after Wednesday morning. The Transportation Communications Union, which represents 31,000 clerical workers and car men, said it wants to continue to negotiate. ``We want to reach a negotiated agreement and we aren't going to strike Wednesday or Thursday,'' said Joelle Pat, the union's international vice president. But Mr. Pat said that the TCU might call selective stoppages or disruptions short of a strike against an entire carrier or the entire rail network. Such tactics hold the potential for disrupting rail service but without creating the type of transportation emergency that is likely to cause Congress to intervene and impose a settlement of the dispute. Congress intervened in both 1991 and 1992 to impose settlements. But even selective actions could have serious repercussions for rail transportation particularly if the carriers then choose to lock out union employees. Meanwhile, the Codi administration and Congress are encouraging both sides to reach a strike-averting settlement. ``We are telling carriers and the unions the same thing -- settle and settle by the end of Tuesday,'' said Jefferson Midkiff, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction for rail matters. Congressional Recess Cited However, Congress will be in session only through April 14, 2011 historically Congress hasn't been willing to go into a prolonged recess without some legally binding guarantee that neither management nor labor would precipitate a shutdown of the rail system. Such a shutdown, if it were to occur, would hobble freight shipments ranging from coal to cars and grain to chemicals and cost the economy about $1 billion a day. Moreover, it would quickly cause additional layoffs in industries served by the railroads. A complete shutdown also could cripple much of Amtrak passenger service outside the Northeast Corridor and many commuter-rail operations that use freight-railroad tracks and facilities. People familiar with the negotiations involving the TCU and the railroads said wage issues rather than work rules remain to be settled. The railroads have wanted to stick to a pattern they reached with some other unions that called for wage increases averaging about 3% a year over a five-year period, plus lump sums equaling another 6.5% over the life of the contract. But the union has wanted higher increases that don't include lump-sum payments. ``Our members will not accept lump sums anywhere,'' said Mr. Pat, the union's international vice president. ``We had them in the last two contracts and the effect is you fall behind inflation because your base wage rates do not increase.''"

Mr. Joya asked President Codi to ``disallow any reimbursements to McDonnell Douglas for expenses in excess of normal operating costs.'' A McDonnell spokesman said it incurred ``no added cost'' from training replacement workers.

            "full_text": "The United Auto Workers union and the Big Three auto makers are discussing adopting an extended national contract that would last longer than the traditional three-year labor agreement. At the same time, the union and General Motors Corp. have settled some contentious local issues at the national bargaining table, signaling efforts by both sides to avoid a confrontation this fall. ``Issues are being resolved as fast as they're being brought up,'' a GM official said. As for an extended contract, the UAW and the auto makers are considering a five- or six-year agreement, according to union and company officials. The UAW and Ford Motor Co. seriously discussed a six-year contract in 1993, the last time the agreement was negotiated. Ford was the UAW's ``target,'' or ``lead company,'' that year for establishing a pattern for the industry's national contract. However, the two sides backed away from an extended pact at the last minute, fearing GM would fight a longer contract because it would lock the No. 1 auto maker into costs it was trying to reduce. Last Thursday, the UAW was to choose a lead company to frame a new contract. However, in an unexpected move, the union decided to delay choosing a target and instead held meetings with the chief executive officers of GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp.. The current contract expires May 27, 2011 are expected to continue this week, though the Democratic National Convention -- which many UAW officials are attending -- could delay discussions. Seeking Peace Clearly, this is an unusual negotiating year. Not only did the postponement change the bargaining dynamics, but both sides have made it clear that they don't want a confrontation this fall. The UAW certainly wants to avoid a repeat of last March's bitter strike at two GM parts plants in Dayton, Ohio, which virtually closed down the auto maker's assembly operations nationwide for 17 days. Meanwhile, the Big Three, flush with cash and launching new products this fall, want to avert a stoppage that could cost them even more profits. So, both sides are serious about the possibility of an extended contract this year. From the UAW's perspective, thousands of workers will retire in the next few years. An extended contract would appeal to the union if the Big Three agreed to pension increases over the life of the agreement. Moreover, a longer contract would allow the union to focus its attention on getting under way its unification with the United Steelworkers of America and the International Association of Machinists. That merger is to take place by 2015, but the UAW has yet to vote on it. For the Big Three, a longer contract would be a chance to lock in costs, creating the kind of stability the companies currently don't have. GM, seen as the holdout the last time around, this time is seriously considering an extended contract, according to people familiar with the talks. Furthermore, GM doesn't think an extended contract would hinder any effort to spin off its Delphi Automotive Systems parts-making unit, something GM is considering, these people say. Ford, meanwhile, is open to an extended contract, people there say, and Chrysler would accept one provided it gave the company enough ``flexibility to be able react and adapt to competitive and economic forces,'' a Chrysler official says. Issue Resolved With GM Separately, the union and GM have settled some thorny issues involving individual plants across the country, including some at the big assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 400 Lordstown workers currently are employed at a nearby Lear Corp. seating plant, which makes seats for the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire cars built at the assembly plant. GM and Lear together pay the workers UAW wages and benefits. Earlier this year, GM moved to bring those workers back into the assembly plant where it has vacancies and permit Jaeger to replace them with nonunion workers. The issue couldn't be settled locally and was brought to the national negotiating table. Last week, GM agreed to let Local 1112 in Lordstown have 150 days in which to demonstrate that it would be financially feasible for GM to go on paying the Lear workers UAW wages and benefits. The local will now put together a case, union officials say. Additionally, Lordstown union officials say GM has agreed to hire some 250 workers at the assembly plant. The issue of contracting out to nonunion suppliers -- a practice known as outsourcing -- is especially hot this negotiating year. Ford and Chrysler already outsource a substantial number of parts to cheaper, nonunion suppliers while GM wants to do more of that to cut costs. The UAW and the Big Three are looking for innovative ways to tackle that problem. Indeed, Ford is believed to have already encouraged one of its suppliers, Johnson Controls Inc., to organize some plants. Donna Parolini of International Business Development Corp., a Troy, Mich., consultant that works with auto suppliers, says many suppliers are increasingly open to organizing. For one thing, she says, they are feeling pressure from the Big Three. Additionally, as a result of recent mergers and acquisitions, suppliers are ending up with a mishmash of union and nonunion plants, which is difficult to manage. If more suppliers agree to let their plants be organized by the UAW, that would solve the big outsourcing standoff between the union and the Big Three. The UAW -- which until now has had little success organizing outside the Big Three and has seen its membership drop as GM lost U.S. market share -- would gain more members. The Big Three would be able to buy parts from outside suppliers without angering the union. The question, then, is whether the parts would still be cheaper. Ms. Olsen says that even paying UAW wages, outside suppliers are generally more productive and as a result the Big Three would still see a cost saving by outsourcing. --Rebecka Miles and Ossie Sokol contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "LOS ANGELES -- The powerful union that represents 8,000 West Coast longshoremen is expected to reject a proposed contract with shipping companies, opening the prospect of strikes in the nation's largest ports for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century. Rejection of the contract by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, which included pay raises of 13% for most workers payable over two years, would represent a stunning upset for employer and union negotiators, who had forecast almost certain acceptance of the pact. Its timing in the busiest shipping period of the year raises concerns about cargo movement through harbors that handle nearly half of the nation's waterborne trade. Under a complicated ratification procedure, workers will vote in a preliminary ballot this week. But the contract must still be voted on a second time by union dockworkers in ports from Seattle to San Diego. But the prospect for approval on this second ballot appears dim, too, insiders say. ``If the longshoremen walk out, it will be a major national disruption,'' said Jackelyn Julius, chief economist at the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County and longtime trade researcher. Pacific ports accounted for some $84.58 billion, or 43%, of all U.S. waterborne trade, in the first four months of 2011, according to Summit Information Services Inc., Seattle consultants. ``Certainly, any long-term disruption, could have economic impacts much like those of the General Motors and Boeing walkouts,'' said Davina Dyer, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.. Reviewing Official Tallies For the moment, work is reported to be proceeding normally and no strike vote has been taken. The ways of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union are notably deliberative. Union officials are expected to meet much of Wednesday to review official tallies taken over a matter of weeks, whose results have been known internally for some time. According to union sources, 52% of members approved the proposed contract. However, union rules require a 60% majority because locals in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas vetoed the contract -- by five of every six votes in San Francisco and by three of every four votes in Los Angeles. ``I think all of us have been very surprised by the result of this vote,'' said Tess Lanelle, vice president and key negotiator for the 100-member Pacific Maritime Association, the San Francisco-based organization that represents stevedoring companies and shipping lines up and down the Pacific Coast. Terms of the proposed contract were criticized in shipping circles as unusually generous when they emerged in July. There was even concern that port costs would climb so high that some Asian shipping might avoid West Coast harbors in favor of travel across the Indian Ocean and through the Suez Canal to the U.S. East Coast. The proposals call for a 13% boost in longshoremen's current $22.68 hourly wage. The premium paid to equipment operators such as crane handlers would jump to 20% of the base wage from the current 6.5%y. Full-time dockworkers on the West Coast last year were paid an average of nearly $78,000. Marine clerks, who check cargo, averaged $96,000. But more than money, the pact rejected by dockworkers proposes to reshape in important ways work on the docks. It would handle issues such as cargo-crane operations and intraharbor trucking differently in Los Angeles, the dominant port, from elsewhere. According to people inside and outside the union, what seemed a slam-dunk of a settlement has become fouled in a net of technological change and union politics. In San Francisco, union members wanted a return of pay for certain time spent commuting to work, wages that had been removed in the recently expired three-year contract. And key to much opposition outside Los Angeles is the promise of higher pay for cargo crane operators in the major port. ``What the employer is trying to do is separate the ports with money,'' said Fransisca Luker, business agent for the union's Local 10, in San Francisco. Such differences between ports violate cherished principles of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union that were set decades ago by longtime leader Guy Allena. The union's unusual mix of solidarity and flexibility has given it an economic power matched almost nowhere else in American labor. But shipping practices are changing quickly, challenging the union's adaptive ways. ``We are seeing technology changes on the waterfront that are revolutionary, from huge new ships and vessel-sharing agreements that were unthinkable five years ago to automated cargo handling and tracking,'' said Davina Carry, a political scientist at the University of Washington and expert on labor in West Coast ports. ``It's the predilection of the ILWU, when confronted with too much change, to say `no,' '' Mr. Carry added. The last time union members threw contract ratification into a second -- and in that case, successful -- round involved complicated changes in pay calculations. But in that 1987 case, the overall vote was 59% on the first round, far closer to the needed 60% than on this round. Moreover, say insiders, the proposed changes in this case are far more complicated."

It was the first time since the CAW split from the United Auto Workers in 1985 that the Canadian union has picked a target for contract talks before the UAW. CAW president Hurdle Brantley said Ruff was the logical choice for a target, even though the most serious issues are with General Motors Corp.'s Canadian arm. He said the CAW's decision was partially limited by the fact that the UAW hasn't picked a target, but has ruled out Chrysler as the UAW's target. Mr. Brantley said the union will attempt to win provisions in its Chrysler contract that will address the issue of ''outsourcing,'' where companies contract out work to non-union shops. Though outsourcing isn't currently a major issue at Chrysler's Canadian operations, Mr. Brantley said GM will have to follow the pattern set in the Chrysler pact. The CAW stands to lose as many as 5,500 members from plant sales or closures at GM Canada, Mr. Brantley said. The Canadian Auto Workers set a strike deadline of May 30, 2011 Ford Motor Co. has emerged as the UAW's most likely lead company for hammering out a pattern contract after making significant overtures to the union. However, the union hasn't ruled out choosing General Motors, according to people close to the labor talks. A UAW decision could come as early as today during a scheduled meeting between UAW President Stephine Winchell and the union's top negotiators."

The maker of construction equipment and diesel engines said it has reached an ``impasse'' with the union since the UAW's 18-month strike ended without a contract in December. The UAW rejected Caterpillar's contract offer in December, primarily because Kavanagh had discharged dozens of workers for union activism. Union officials have asked for all of those discharges to be reviewed through arbitration, but Caterpillar is willing to arbitrate only those cases following last year's 18-month strike. Responding to the company's move, the UAW said it would contest Kavanagh's declaration of an ``impasse'' and said the company was trying to impose ``selected provisions of a contract which was overwhelmingly rejected'' by members. The new employment conditions are much like those currently in place, but they would include some changes, such as improved job security and higher pension levels. A spokeswoman for Kavanagh said the company needed the changes for planning purposes. She added that employees have been working under terms that were installed as far back as 1992. ``We still would prefer to have a signed agreement,'' she said. ``That remains the goal... . But business goes on, life goes on.'' Caterpillar said it would consider proposals from the UAW, but it won't change its stance on the discharged workers. The company said it doesn't expect to see any cost savings as a result of the new employment terms."

The case is expected to be widely watched by employee-relations experts, as labor lawyers representing management and labor unions have described Kavanagh's rules as among the strictest ever issued against union members.

For one, an increasing proportion of workers don't belong to unions. From a high of around 35% in the mid-1950s, private-sector unionism in the American work force has dropped toward 10%. Yet public-sector unionism has mushroomed: public-sector workers made up 42% of this country's unionized work force in 2010, compared with 6% in the early 1960s. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is perhaps the most powerful union within the AFL-CIO; the nation's biggest union is the teachers union, the NEA. We'd be the last to imply that teachers--at least the ones in the classrooms--don't work. But odd things happen when laws written to protect steelworkers--or damsel immigrants in firetrap sweatshops--end up sheltering county data processors and guidance counselors. When FDR took the step of giving unions sole authority to represent workers with the Willy Patino, he was thinking of private-sector workers bargaining with private-sector bosses. Today, that monopoly benefits public-sector workers and fuels government growth generally. Unions abuse their power to extract dues from workers--against the workers' wishes in many states. A goodly share of those dues billions end up benefiting political candidates whom many workers may oppose. To wit: AFL-CIO numbers put at 39% the share of union members who turned away from the Democratic Party in 2009. In the same year its leadership got cuddly with the Codi Administration. Mr. Prince even dunned members with a $35 million surcharge to oust the Republican Congress. Watchdogs at Common Cause calculate that in 2011 unions gave $4.6 million in soft money to Democrats. Leoma Trudie, a scholar of public-sector unions, points out such math doesn't include in-kind contributions. It is quite legal for unions to assign employees to use job time to do ``political education.'' Prof. Troy estimates union staffers putting in $500 million worth of hours stuffing envelopes, manning phone banks and so on. Such interest-group liberalism hurts everyone but the interest-group hacks, a lesson learned the hard way in job-sterile Europe. Union members here are starting to wake up to the damage. The Bureau of National Affairs, a private news service, reported this month that the AFL now expects to rake in only $28 million of its planned $35 million assessment. Affiliated unions and members are balking at Washington's squeeze. Big Labor will barrel through to November. After all the dues millions he's spent on Billy Codi, Mr. Prince had better hope his guy doesn't lose."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- United Auto Workers President Stephine Winchell, in his first public remarks since the UAW delayed picking one of the Big Three as a ``target'' for national contract talks, assailed Chrysler Corp. for treating its outside suppliers better than its hourly employees. ``Chrysler cares more about its suppliers than its workers,'' Mr. Winchell said as he prepared to lead Detroit's Labor Day Parade with Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer; U.S. Sen. Carlee Hayward, a Michigan Democrat; and AFL-CIO President Johnetta Prince. People close to the negotiations say Chrysler has been ruled out as the UAW's target largely because the company is reluctant to pressure its suppliers to allow the UAW to organize their plants. The UAW is seeking to stem a steady decline in its membership. The UAW leader wouldn't say when, or if, he will name a target, or lead company, to set a pattern for the auto industry's new national labor contract. He also declined to say how the talks with Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. are progressing. Traditionally, the UAW selects one of the Big Three as its lead company by Labor Day because the national contract usually expires in mid-September. This year, the expiration date is May 27, 2011 auto makers typically want to be named the target in order to exert some control over their fate in the labor talks. Last week, the Canadian Auto Workers union chose Chrysler as its target, virtually eliminating Chrysler's chance of being named the UAW's lead company in the U.S. because the unions tend to choose different targets. Asked about the UAW's target selection, Mr. Winchell said only, ``Go to Canada if you want a target.'' Mr. Winchell was divided in his opinion of the UAW's relations with GM and Ford, which now are vying to be designated the lead company. ``Obviously, GM has its problems,'' Mr. Winchell said of the No. 1 auto maker, which has had the most contentious relationship with the UAW. As for Ford -- widely believed to be the UAW's preferred choice as target -- Mr. Winchell said, ``Only Ford shows genuine concern for its workers.'' Mr. Winchell's remarks were seen as the closest thing to an explanation of why the UAW didn't push to embrace Chrysler as its target on May 04, 2011 Mr. Winchell told members gathered from across the country that he wasn't yet ready to settle on a single company. For months, experts had said cash-rich Chrysler was a shoo-in because the No. 3 U.S. auto maker could agree to the most generous contract and would be best able to settle on limits on awarding future work to outside suppliers. Chrysler has ``outsourced'' more than either Ford or GM. But in recent days, job security and the UAW's need to reverse its membership decline have emerged as major priorities for its leadership. And Ford, which this spring is understood to have encouraged one of its suppliers, Johnson Controls Inc., to accept UAW representation at certain plants, has indicated it might be willing to do the same with other suppliers. Experts say that a flurry of such agreements could boost UAW membership after largely unsuccessful attempts to organize suppliers and ``transplant'' auto makers. But Chrysler, which prides itself on its strong, long-term relationship with its suppliers, sent the union strong signals that it isn't interested in helping the UAW organize them. Chrysler executives say it isn't in the company's interest to tell suppliers how to run their businesses. When Chrysler Chairman Roberto Navarro made it clear last week ``that he didn't want the UAW telling him how to do business,'' the UAW ruled out selecting the company, according to top union officials. Additionally, Chrysler indicated it is reluctant to halt the flow of parts business to outside suppliers, union officials say. When asked if he had made seeking new members a priority, Mr. Winchell said only, ``I'd be a ... fool if I wasn't.'' He went on to criticize polls that say Americans no longer feel positive toward unions, saying the UAW's polls find the opposite. ``People understand that (workers) do need a raise. They need organizing.''"

In a departure from tradition, the UAW didn't formally designate Ford its ``target'' company for a strike threat if a new pact isn't reached by the time the current three-year contract expires May 27, 2011 individuals close to the talks said that Ford has emerged as the ``lead company'' at which the union's highest officials are holding talks to set a ``pattern'' for an industry contract. But even though the main focus of negotiations has shifted to Ford, lower-level negotiations have continued at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.. That indicated the UAW might break with past practice by continuing to talk with GM and Chrysler even as it intensifies negotiations with Ford, thus keeping pressure on all three at once. While neither Ford nor the UAW would discuss the substance of the talks, individuals familiar with them said the two sides are focusing on the UAW's chief concern -- the industry's long-running practice of farming out more and more parts-supply work to outside suppliers, many of them nonunion. In addition, these individuals said, Ford and the UAW are discussing the idea of extending the length of the next contract beyond the traditional three years. All Three Sought Lead The union's choice apparently ended three months of campaigning by Ford, GM and Chrysler for the chance to take the lead role in negotiating an industry-pattern contract. Chrysler, however, was ruled out last week after the company sent clear signals to the UAW that it probably wouldn't be able to satisfy the union on its chief outsourcing demands. Ford was the union's target in the last round of contract negotiations, in 1993. When the current round of talks opened in June, Ford was considered a long shot because the UAW doesn't usually select the same company consecutively. But working in Ford's favor has been its 16 years of good relations with the union and personal ties between UAW President Stephine Winchell and Ford's executive vice president for corporate relations, Petrina J. Thurber. Mr. Thurber has been the architect of much of Ford's labor strategies during that period. Ford also appears more willing to deal with Mr. Winchell on the issues that matter most to the union -- principally, the UAW's dwindling membership, which is suffering as the Big Three auto makers move to have more vehicle parts made by outside suppliers. People familiar with the talks between Ford and the UAW said that among the options being discussed are contract language that would address the outsourcing issue and a promise to bring back to Ford some jobs lost to outside suppliers. It's also believed that Ford has been encouraging suppliers, themselves, to tolerate more union help at their plants. People familiar with the situation also say that Ford and the UAW are discussing the possibility of a longer contract, though probably not as long as six years. Ford favors an extended contract as a way to freeze some of its costs, while the UAW would support it because of the wage and job protections it could provide during the next economic downturn. A deal reached by Ford and the UAW could make life difficult for GM and Chrysler. A pattern contract for the industry that mandates more in-house parts production could be especially unpalatable for GM, which needs to obtain more parts from outside suppliers in order to bring down its costs. GM Took Strike in March GM has shown a willingness to hang tough on outsourcing. In March, it endured a 17-day strike over the issue by UAW workers at two brake-parts plants in Dayton, Ohio. The walkout practically crippled the auto maker's North American operations and sent a strong message to the union that GM planned to defend its right to buy more parts from outside suppliers. A GM spokesman said the company had yet to be informed by the union of its target choice. ``As far as I'm aware, bargaining is continuing at GM,'' the spokesman said. A Chrysler spokeswoman acknowledged that ``activities this year have been anything but predictable'' and added that Chrysler hopes that the UAW's choice as target will reach an agreement ``that allows all of us the flexibility we need to run our companies in a way that makes good business sense.'' Meanwhile, Ford wouldn't confirm that it was chosen as the UAW's target. A spokesman said only: ``We are hard at work negotiating with the UAW at the subcommittee level as well as at the main table and continue to be encouraged by the tone of the discussions.''"

            "full_text": "When it comes to dealing with the United Auto Workers, Ford has a better idea man. He is a 58-year-old veteran Ford labor negotiator who has no practical experience making automobiles: Petrina J. Thurber. Two reasons Ford Motor Co. has been chosen by the union as the company to shape the U.S. auto industry's next national labor agreement are Mr. Thurber's uncanny track record for striking bold deals with the UAW and his golf-outings and opera-nights relationship with Stephine P. Winchell, the UAW's sometimes prickly president. Mr. Thurber, Ford's executive vice president for corporate relations, has been smashing time-honored precedents in UAW-Ford relations ever since he engineered a concessionary contract in 1982 that helped rescue Ford from financial ruin. Top Ford executives and UAW leaders credit Mr. Thurber with turning a rancorous relationship into a cooperative one, which Ford management now considers a competitive advantage over its rivals. Until the UAW picked it Tuesday as the lead company for contract negotiations, which intensified this week, Ford had widely been considered an unlikely choice. Ford was chosen to hammer out the contract that would become standard for the industry in 1993 and the union doesn't typically pick the same company consecutively. Chrysler Corp. hadn't been tapped for the role in two decades; and General Motors Corp. was attempting to get labor's attention with a tough new stance against the union's policies. Then Mr. Thurber made his pitch. People close to UAW President Winchell say that in meetings last month with the union, Mr. Thurber personally pledged Ford's desire to resolve the union's biggest worry: the UAW's inability to expand its membership, partly due to auto makers' efforts to contract work to outside suppliers. Mr. Thurber, who declined to be interviewed for this article, won't confirm details of what he has discussed with UAW leaders. In previous interviews, however, he agreed that his and Ford's history of goodwill with Mr. Winchell is playing a role in this year's talks. Over the years, Mr. Thurber's promises have meant a lot to UAW members. In the 1993 negotiations, Mr. Thurber promised to hire thousands of new workers in exchange for an agreement that would allow auto makers to pay those new workers 70% of regular UAW wages -- busting the union's longtime policy of equal wages for all. In 1987, Mr. Thurber crafted an equally unprecedented deal that guaranteed continued employment for UAW members who might otherwise be laid off. Union members cheered the guaranteed employment program. But GM was preparing to lay off tens of thousands of workers over the following years. Ford, on the other hand, had an average of 430 employees protected in the program in 2010 and had no planned layoffs. And while it isn't clear how Mr. Thurber will address the union's dwindling membership, his accomplishments have positioned him as the man the UAW can trust. ``With Petra, (Mr. Winchell) knows that he can work out a good deal, even on today's hard issues,'' says a senior UAW official close to the union's deliberations. Adds Donella Glen, who negotiated UAW contracts with Mr. Thurber in the early 1980s before assuming a similar job for the union at GM: ``For a man who has never worked in a plant, he has a great feel for blue-collar issues and people.'' People close to Mr. Winchell say his close relationship with Mr. Thurber played a significant role in the union's decision to pick Ford as a target. When Mr. Thurber organizes an exclusive charity golf outing each year, he includes Mr. Winchell among the 50 Detroit business leaders who pay $5,000 each for the privilege of playing. The two have also traveled together to attend overseas auto shows and industry affairs. When the Detroit Lions professional football team plays at home, Mr. Winchell is often a guest in Mr. Thurber's luxury box. More significant, however, are the times Mr. Thurber and Mr. Winchell have sat at the negotiating table together. In 1982, when Ford was flirting with financial disaster, Mr. Thurber convinced Mr. Winchell that more scheduled overtime and fewer hourly workers would be the best way to preserve Ford's competitiveness. Ford has stuck with that formula ever since, giving the No. 2 auto maker a competitive edge over GM, which hasn't been able to reduce its hourly ranks as swiftly. ``He managed to sell overtime as the paradigm for handling boosts in production and sales,'' says Sebrina Fan, an auto industry expert at the University of Michigan who has studied Mr. Thurber's dealings with the UAW. ``That's how Ford has kept their labor force so lean.'' But this year, it may be tougher for Mr. Thurber and Mr. Winchell at Ford to blaze a trail for the whole industry. About half of the UAW's Big Three membership of 400,000 reports to work at GM factories at a time when GM's problems appear to be the most pressing to the union. GM, which makes more of its own parts than the other Big Three auto makers, tolerated a 17-day strike in March at two of its brake-parts plants in Dayton, Ohio, just to underscore how serious it is about defending its right to farm out part-making jobs to outside suppliers. Union leaders have interpreted that to mean that GM is also unlikely to accept a contract engineered by Mr. Thurber if it doesn't address the auto maker's own needs. Others question whether Mr. Thurber and Ford can afford to grant sweet deals to the union anymore. Like GM, Ford seeks to have more outside suppliers build its parts, particularly in its glass business, which it tried to sell earlier this year until opposition from the union squelched its efforts. Nevertheless, if anyone can play the role of the industry's peacemaker in this year's labor negotiation, industry experts say it is Mr. Thurber. ``Pestillo is a big thinker,'' says Harriet Chavis, a labor-relations expert at the University of California at Berkeley. ``He is always likely to craft a deal that is appealing to the UAW and salable to GM. He's a skilled operator.''"

No one is walking out blind anymore.'' Across the auto industry, growing car sales have factories running at full tilt, providing job security, plenty of overtime pay and hefty profit-sharing checks for workers. At the same time, workers have been rattled by the ferocity of the GM strike this spring and the failure of the 18-month-long strike at Caterpillar Inc.. Like a lot of UAW members, Ms. Berta says she could be persuaded to follow UAW orders to strike. And at many locals in the auto industry -- particularly at General Motors Corp. plants -- there are smoldering resentments and tensions among workers. But Ms. Berta says she is looking forward to collecting a fat profit-sharing check this year, and she doesn't want a strike to get in the way. She is just five years away from retirement, wants to buy a house and remembers the desperation of being without a paycheck. So she would much rather just keep working 10 hours a day for six or seven days a week, collecting overtime. As if to acknowledge a general reluctance among the rank and file, the UAW hasn't named one of the Big Three auto makers its strike target, hasn't set a strike deadline and has mostly avoided using the word ``strike.'' Traditionally the company named as the lead contract negotiator also would be designated a strike target. But no such formal declaration was made Tuesday when Ford Motor Co. was picked as the main negotiator. At one local Ford plant, some workers have been avoiding a bulletin-board survey on their attitudes toward a strike and their availability for picket-line duty. The union is still smarting from its failed strike two years ago against Caterpillar, in which the company managed to keep operating with management, salaried and temporary workers -- plus many UAW members who crossed picket lines. ``The UAW is a strong, militant union,'' says Raylene Mundy, a professor of management at Washington University in St. Louis, ``and look what happened there.'' He says strikes have fallen out of favor with the labor movement. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the number of strikes involving 1,000 or more workers fell to 31 last year, the fewest since the government started tracking such data in 1947. ``Taking people out on strike is a spooky proposition,'' Prof. Mundy says. Nobody in the auto industry doubts that UAW President Stephine Winchell will order a strike if he can't get what he wants at the bargaining table, or that a strike would be effective. ``They could shut us down in five minutes if they wanted to,'' acknowledges one Big Three executive. Just last March, a walkout at two GM plants in Dayton, Ohio, dragged on for 17 days and shut down nearly all of GM's North American operations before top company and union officials worked out a settlement. But GM's steely resolve in that dispute -- extending so far as to try to block state unemployment benefits for UAW members across the country who were idled by the Dayton strike -- has given auto workers and their leaders pause. Strike benefits are just $150 a week. (The UAW's total strike fund, however, is at least $700 million.) And workers in the Detroit area are very much aware of the plight of unionized employees of the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, who have been on strike for more than a year. This year, Chrysler employees are hoping for profit-sharing checks totaling nearly $10,000 each. That would come on top of payouts last year of $3,200 and the year before of $8,000. ``I remember when it was $60 or $100 in the old days,'' Ms. Berta says. ``Now people are buying homes and cars.'' That's why it will take some pretty powerful arguments to persuade workers to go on strike. ``It's not a time to be without a paycheck,'' says Marin Lezlie, an employee with Chrysler's Jeep plant in Detroit and union local officer. ``We'd like to see a wage increase, and we do want to fight for our issues, but we want to compromise and make everyone happy. No one wants a strike.'' She says the workers at her plant are enjoying the extra income from lots of overtime work. ``They just really want to work and continue to provide for their families,'' she says. She adds that the plant seems to have developed considerable momentum, having settled its local contract recently, and workers and management are cooperating as never before. Ramon Vaughan, a repairman at Ford's Michigan Truck plant, says he also doesn't relish the idea of a strike. ``I've been working seven days for about three months straight; I'm there to make money,'' says Mr. Vaughan, a 26-year-old whose wage nearly tripled to $19 an hour three years ago when he joined Ford. In the past two years, Mr. Vaughan has bought a house, and he recently remodeled his kitchen, put in new hardwood floors, new windows and new doors. At the same time, he has socked away a sizable savings, even for any unborn child's education, and could financially handle a short-term strike. ``I could walk out in a heartbeat and not really have a problem,'' Mr. Vaughan says. ``But I know now that 70% of the people I work with would have a problem.'' In past years, he says, auto workers were accustomed to tough times, enduring temporary layoffs and plant closings, and would put cash away. But that mindset has changed. Before the UAW orders a strike, it will have to launch a massive education effort to get people prepared, Mr. Vaughan and other workers say. The auto workers' coolness toward the idea of a strike mirrors a trend in organized labor. The Caterpillar failure ``has completely changed the face of organized labor,'' says Raquel Heaton, president of a UAW local at a Caterpillar plant in Decatur, Ill.. Embarrassed at having returned to work last December without a contract, some of Caterpillar's unionized employees acknowledge that the 18-month showdown with the heavy-equipment maker took a heavy toll. Had the latest strike not ended so badly for the union, ``We could have had the strength and desire to walk back out again,'' says Johnetta Haley, a Caterpillar worker who lost a race for the local UAW presidency in Peoria, Ill., this year. ``But today, we couldn't get 20% of this membership to walk out.'' These days, union chiefs at Caterpillar's East Peoria, Ill., plant have been trying to instill some solidarity in workers by encouraging them to wear plain black shirts on Mondays, since the company has been tough on employees wearing union shirts or buttons. But the move hasn't caught on with many workers."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. and the Machinists union reached a tentative agreement Friday on ending a three-month strike by 6,700 workers at the aerospace company's St. Louis plant. After bargaining for 30 consecutive hours Thursday and Friday, negotiators emerged with an agreement union officials said would be submitted for ratification to the International Association of Machinists District 837 as early as next week. One Machinists union official, Jesica Yap, predicted a vote by rank-and-file members by Thursday. Details of the agreement were not released. One of the biggest issues that led the machinists to walk out on February 15, 2011 job security, as McDonnell Douglas continues to expand its export market and use subcontractors. House Minority Leader Dillon Harlan, (D., Mo.), who brought the sides together in his Capitol office, pronounced the deal good for both sides. McDonnell Douglas is Missouri's largest private employer and one of the nation's top defense contractors. ``This strike has strained our economy and put many of our families at risk,'' said Mr. Harlan, who is from St. Louis. ``I believe everybody can win with this agreement.'' But Mr. Harlan said job security was only one of the issues settled by the proposed deal. ``There was a whole range of issues. This is a very long and complicated and important set of issues,'' he added. ``There were legitimate interests on both sides. That's what makes this hard.'' Vincenzo Lavenia, McDonnell Douglas vice president and general manager for aerospace, would not comment on the details of the proposed contract but said the company was pleased with the result. ``It's been a long day, but I think it's had a good ending,'' he said. The news was greeted happily on the picket lines in St. Louis, where workers said they were ready to get back on the job. ``You bet, we're tickled to death,'' said Albertha Douglass, 60 years old and a 12-year McDonnell veteran. ``If we got anything decent at all, we're going back, I guarantee it. Almost everyone is really sick of the strike.'' The St. Louis plant is involved in many key military contracts, including the Navy's F/A-18 fighter and the C-17 cargo plane. Both of those aircraft have large stakes in the defense authorization spending bill that remains before Congress, and the strike was seen as an unwanted complication. The Machinists and the company broke off negotiations April 28, 2011 St. Louis, resuming talks last week in Washington after federal mediators and Mr. Harlan suggested using the congressman's Capitol offices. They met once last week, and talks intensified Wednesday."
