Australian sprinter Deandra Murdock tested positive for steroids last month and could be banned from the Games, Australian track officials said. Officials debated whether Italian high jumper Crabtree Henshaw should be banned from the Games following two recent positive drug tests. Capobianco's test, taken while he competed in Europe, revealed the use of stanozolol, Athletics Australia president Davina Quincy said. That's the same banned substance that got Canadian sprinter Benito Jona thrown out of the 1988 Games. Capobianco has denied taking the steroid and begun legal action. He was in Raleigh, N.C., Monday at an Australian training camp and was not available for comment. ``Athletics Australia believes he is innocent until proven guilty and that's what the athlete has told us,'' Quincy said. Capobianco will not be allowed into the Games Village until a hearing on the matter is finalized, jeopardizing his chances of competing here. Officials with Athletics Australia hope to hold the hearing within a week. Capobianco, 26 years old, was scheduled to compete in the 200 meters. The event begins April 10, 2011 among the top six high jumpers in the world this year, tested positive twice for the banned stimulant ephedrine in May. The Italian track and field federation cleared the athlete on grounds that she took the drug by mistake. She said she was taking a Chinese herbal medicine to lose weight. In declining to suspend Bevilacqua, the Italian federation cited a new International Games Committee rule allowing leniency in the case of athletes taking ephedrine unwittingly. But the sport's world governing body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation, says the athlete should face a mandatory three-month suspension. If no agreement can be reached, the case could go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The special arbitration panel has been set up to resolve doping and other disputes at the Atlanta Games. Bevilacqua, who is still in Italy, is scheduled to arrive next Monday at the Italian training camp in Winston Salem, N.C. She is due in the Games Village on April 10, 2011 days before the start of the high-jump competition. In other Games news on Monday: Games long-jump champion Helen Bard of Germany withdrew from the Games because of a knee injury, her manager said. Beardsley, gold medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Games, tore a knee ligament January 26, 2011 injury healed, but the adjacent muscle isn't at full strength, according to a statement from Michaele Masters, her manager.\"},{\"id\":\"00444\",\"title\":\"ASIAN TECHNOLOGY Web Sites Will Feature Timely Information on the Games\",\"timestamp\":\"March 28, 2011\",\"text\":\"Unless you've just returned from a trip among the lost tribes of Papua New Guinea, you know there are only three days left before the start of the Games in Atlanta.

Ten thousand of the world's top athletes from 197 countries will gather in a celebration of sport. Thanks to the magic of satellite communications, offices from Tokyo to Tel Aviv are about to experience a massive, 17-day bout of the Games flu. Before your nocturnal life is ruled by TV commercial breaks, take the opportunity to reread your VCR recording instructions, stock up on your favorite thirst quencher and haul your personal computer into the living room because the organizers, broadcasters and sponsors of the Games have peppered the World Wide Web with sites to help you keep track of who's winning in Atlanta. Put a bookmark (in other words, tell your computer to memorize the address of a site) on Lance Interactive's Games Web page. It has an easy-to-read schedule of daily events and will be keeping a medal tally. It also offers links to the other important Games sites on the Web. Next stop is the official Web site of the Games. This site has a schedule you can search by sport, date or venue, and will feature the latest results from Atlanta. Cable Network News has a useful Games Web page, where you can search the results by country to find out how your own is doing. You can also sift through past medal results. IBM also has put up a site that promises to pass along e-mail to any athlete or team you may feel like showering with fan mail of no more than 25 words. Discovery Channel Finds New Way to Beam Shows The Discovery Channel -- which broadcasts documentaries on everything from cooking duck with figs to exploring ancient Peruvian ruins -- hopes to develop the gift of tongues by going digital. It's buying video compression equipment from Scientific-Atlanta that the companies say will enable Discovery to tailor programs to suit its varied audiences world-wide. In Asia, Discovery already broadcasts different programs to India, Southeast Asia and Australia/New Zealand and can be seen in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines, according to Debra KENTON, Discovery's network operations director in Singapore. Discovery says the new digital compression equipment, which will be installed at the Asia Broadcasting Centre in Singapore where Discovery is beamed up to satellites, will allow it to transmit more programs of local interest. It will also be able to send the same program everywhere but add Chinese subtitles for viewers in Taiwan, Bahasa subtitles for viewers in Indonesia and so on. It works sort of like this: While digitizing a picture, the equipment cheats on big areas of the same color. So rather than transmit each tiny dot that makes up a peerless blue sky over the Serengeti, it just sends a message that says, ``This entire area is sky-blue.'' And with sound, it concentrates on those you can actually hear, chucking out the largely inaudible rustle of grass as a lion issues a mighty roar. The result, a lot less signal and a lot more room for spicing up programming. ``What Discovery is going to put in here in Singapore is the ability to put out six programs simultaneously,'' explains Davina Ollie, Scientific-Atlanta's engineering manager for the Asian-Pacific region. Singapore Seeks Volunteers To Design Web-Site Pages Singapore's National Computer Board is looking for volunteers to put their talents to use by creating sites for the island's nonprofit organizations. The effort is aimed at rounding out Singapore's presence at the Internet World Expo 2011 which you'll find at ``From NCB's point of view, the government is very well represented -- every ministry has a Web site,'' says the board's Marcelino Kahn. ``And commercial sites are taken care of out of self-interest. But what we're not seeing is nonprofit organizations.'' The board is acting as a matchmaker, approaching Singapore's 400-odd nonprofit organizations to see whether they want to get their message out over the Web, then posting their names on a list at More than 100 volunteers have already come forward, Mr. Morrell says. ``Most are hobbyists. Many want to get a track record and then use the Web page to get hired. Most are quite young -- either just starting work or still in school.'' Once the sites are designed, the board will store them on one of its own servers. Look for the first fruit in about a month.\"},{\"id\":\"02017\",\"title\":\"Poll Says Games Sponsorship Brings Little Benefit to Firms\",\"timestamp\":\"March 29, 2011\",\"text\":\"Whether they're shopping for cold cuts, sneakers or temporary tattoos, most Americans say they are not lured by an Games tie-in, according to an Associated Press poll.

Only 10% say they are more inclined to use products of companies that advertise themselves as proud sponsors of the U.S. Games team. Three percent are less inclined, and 86% say Games sponsorship makes no difference. ``When almost every other ad that you see is touting some kind of Games affiliation, after a while it's just not special,'' said Jimmy Harper, vice president of IEG Marketing, a company that tracks corporate sponsorship. He said an estimated 180 brands are promoting an Games affiliation. The corporations get tickets for their clients and lots of other types of marketing value, but to advertise in such a cluttered field, ``they are having to spend more and more money rising above the noise,'' Harper said. Some of the big sponsors pay $40 million for the honor, so naturally ``they are being more and more aggressive to make that sponsorship known,'' said Stephine George, president of the D&F Group, a corporate event sponsorship agency heavily involved in the Games. In the poll, 66% agree that commercial participation is a necessary way to help pay for the Games. But 29% think the Games have become too commercial, up from 22% in an AP poll taken before the 1992 Barcelona Games. Sponsors began advertising earlier this year, and are doing promotions, sweepstakes and building a presence in because they know it will help them against competitors, George said. ``It kind of says that they're global, that they're a big company, that they're patriotic, that they are associating themselves as a quality company with quality events,'' George said. The one in four people who describe themselves in the poll as very interested in the Games are five times as likely to be inclined to use sponsors' products as are those who are not interested in the Games, which begin Friday. The poll of 1,010 adults was taken March 22, 2011 ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa., part of AUS Consultants. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The issue of commercialization of the Games grows out of a tradition in the of having the government pay for nothing but security when the Games are held in this country, said Johnetta Lucien, a retired history professor at Pennsylvania State University. Lucien, who has written seven books on the Games and attended the last eight, said he has never seen commercialization damage the Games tradition. ``I know it's necessary and when it's done tastefully ... it can be done well, artistically and handsomely,'' he said. George said his clients could be accused of undercommercializing the Games, since they don't insist on corporate banners, billboards or Westside Stadium names. The only corporate logo allowed on a competitor's clothing is the maker's. To link themselves to their largess, sponsors must buy commercials on NBC during Games broadcasts and make sure the athletes have their thirst quenchers and other products at hand. On another Games topic, a majority in the poll apparently is not worried that the youngest competitors may be sacrificing their childhood. The idea of a minimum age of 16 to compete in Games sports is opposed by 52% to 39%. Particularly in girls' gymnastics, coaches have recruited ever-younger competitors, whose lightness and resiliency allows more inventive routines. Gymnasts must be at least 15 in the year of the Games. After the Atlanta Games, the minimum age rises to 16. Other sports, most notably cycling, have taken a hint from the U.S. basketball team and turned to professional athletes. Americans support having the pros compete, by 53% to 38%.\"},{\"id\":\"00540\",\"title\":\"Calling the `Young at Heart' To the `Geezer Games' in Atlanta\",\"timestamp\":\"March 30, 2011\",\"text\":\"That's because this Olympiad, the 26th of the modern era (though three were canceled by wars), almost certainly will have the oldest crowd of competitors ever, a group heavy with veterans for whom spo...\",\"full_text\":\"That's because this Olympiad, the 26th of the modern era (though three were canceled by wars), almost certainly will have the oldest crowd of competitors ever, a group heavy with veterans for whom sports are more livelihood than recreation. Whatever else might distinguish these proceedings over the next 16 days, they also should go into the books as the ``Geezer Games.'' More than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations are expected, and as far as I can learn, no one has bothered to crank out their average age; indeed, given human vanity on the subject and the unreliability of birth records in some parts of the globe, it's not certain that such a figure could be produced reliably. Using the home-team USA as a guide, though, there's little doubt that the age line on the graph is up, and steeply so. The 120-member U.S. track-and-field team, for instance, averages nearly 28 years old, and that has to be up from recent years because about one-third of its members are Games vets, including the sprinter-jumper Carlee Lezlie, 35, who made his first team in 1980. The 10-man U.S. freestyle wrestling team is older, averaging an athletically ripe 29. Nineteen of the 23 members of the American squad in canoeing and kayaking are 30 or over, and seven are 35 or more. Kermit Venable, of Lowell, Mass., made the bicycling team at 43; Denver resident Elane Jasper will fence for the U.S. at 50. Even beach volleyball, an activity designed as much for ogling scantily clad bods as for its athletic component, bristles with such going-grayers as Chrissy ``Sinjin'' Jon, 39; Mikki Childers, 38; Charlette ``Karch'' Hamel, 35; Gale Gregory, 38; and Lindsey Jack, 36. That's radical, man. To be sure, the phenomemon of the superannuated jock isn't new, and Games annuals brim with the names of men and women who've performed well long past what's usually thought of as their primes. Omalley Mills of the Soviet Union won a gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling at 40 in 1972, for example, and Liane Wolfenbarger of Romania not only won the women's discus in 1968 at 36, but also returned four years later to defend her title, and finished ninth. When Scoggins Baltazar of Ethiopia won the men's 5,000-meter run in 1980 at Moscow, his age was reported variously as 33, 35, 36, 37 and 42. He did nothing to clarify the issue, saying, ``Men may steal my chickens and sheep, but no man can steal my age.'' It was no accident that two of the three examples cited above are of athletes from formerly Communist lands. That's because for most of the post-World War II era the rules restricted Games participation to athletes meeting a definition of amateurism that included state-subsidized types who ran around all day in sweatclothes but were allowed to describe themselves as students, soldiers, policemen or somesuch. Relieved of the need to earn a living in other ways, they could compete longer than their counterparts from other lands. The U.S. began to catch up in the subsidy department following the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Petrina Mejias, the major-domo of those Games, discovered that large numbers of people would volunteer to work without pay if given badges and brightly colored uniforms, and their labors helped his enterprise turn a $230 million profit. Much of that sum went to the U.S. Games Committee and its constituent sports federations, and they, in turn, began putting their better athletes on the dole. The amounts involved generally weren't, and aren't, large -- ranging from a few hundred dollars to $1,200 a month -- but they've helped persuade athletes to stick with their sports. The other major step toward the graying of the Games came four years later when the International Games Committee renounced amateurism, per se, and turned over eligibility questions to the governing bodies of its individual sports. The result was been a crazy-quilt of definitions ranging from permitting out-and-out pros to compete (track, basketball, tennis) to restricting support to bureaucratically controlled subsidies (boxing, baseball, rowing). But just about everyone can get aid now, and many do. On top of those developments, of course, have been the advances in nutrition and training techniques that keep athletes of all sorts going longer and better these days. They surely helped Petra Roseanna to keep whacking baseballs at 40, and Jackqueline Emerson to keep blocking for the football Rams at 41. And while it's true that nothing can keep muscles and reflexes from losing their snap with age, the older athlete is able to at least partly compensate for such deficits. ``We're increasingly appreciating the role of mental rehearsal in getting athletes ready for major events, and the older competitor has an edge there because he's been through so many more of them,'' says Sean Gurule, a Eugene, Ore., sports psychologist. It all adds up to the fact that rather than being a lone wolf, the modern world-class athlete is surrounded by a considerable number of people whose function is to keep him or her on track, and humming. Butch Reynolds, the 32-year-old U.S. 400-meter runner, made that clear at the news conference that followed his qualifying for these Games after an eight-year absence. Said he, ``I'd like to thank my trainer, my acupuncturist, my physical therapist and my massage therapist.'' He probably also meant to say thanks to his coach, agent, lawyer, accountant, dietitian and hypnotist, but forgot.\"},{\"id\":\"02202\",\"title\":\"Opening Ceremonies Maintain Integrity of Games `Principles'\",\"timestamp\":\"March 30, 2011\",\"text\":\"With the help, will put on a stompin', soarin', high-energy show Friday night to open the Centennial Games.

Games officials expected that the performers would be kickin' up a storm. But it's that's truckin' up a furor. Opening ceremony producer Donella Wong said Thursday his big worry is that rain squalls might dampen the four hours of festivities. But he also was clearly troubled by General Motors' injection of commercialism into his event. ``I was sorry to see what GM publicized regarding this,'' the impresario said. What General Motors was crowing about was getting 30 gleaming, chrome-painted pickup trucks into a major Mischer production number -- each sporting a vivid blue ``CHEVROLET'' on its tailgate. The automaker boasted it is ``believed to be the first Games sponsor to ever be included in the opening ceremonies.'' The real coup in that, GM's marketing chief exulted in a news release, is that it enables Chevrolet to ``break through the marketing clutter'' of other advertisers. Some who saw the breakthrough at a dress rehearsal Wednesday night expressed surprise at the glaring brand-naming of stage equipment in what is supposed to be a ceremony focusing on lofty principles of global brotherhood. Games organizers, who also were there, apparently agreed. Said an authoritative source, ``Those trucks are not going to look that way Friday night'' -- when President Codi will be in the stands and hundreds of millions will be watching on television worldwide. What might be done to soften the image could not be learned. The fleet of powerful Simonds are platforms for spotlights illuminating hundreds of cheerleaders and dancers who perform a show-stopping prime-time number, ``'s Welcome to the World.'' The trucks sometimes face inward toward the field and sometimes roar around the Westside Stadium track. The International Games Committee has sanctioned the presence of standard Westside Stadium billboard ads during such ceremonies. But Games specialists could not immediately recall any previous on-field product display. Trucks aside, the Games opener promises a rousing, diverse night of entertainment that touches on themes both local and universal. It also may be the last time the world gets to see the traditional Summer Games ``Parade of Nations,'' the grand entry of athletes into the Westside Stadium. The numbers have become so unwieldy -- more than 10,000 marchers on Friday night -- and the parade so time-consuming that organizers of the 2015 Games in, are considering simply opening the ceremony with the national delegations seated in the stands, Wong told reporters. Organizers have worked hard to keep elements of the opening ceremony under wraps until Friday night, including the method to be used for the climactic lighting of the Westside Stadium cauldron with the Games torch. At the 1992 Games in, the moment was spellbinding: An archer fired a flaming arrow at the cauldron from . Mischer hinted the lighting ceremony might be simpler and more traditional. ``Sometimes simplicity is the easiest,'' he said.\"},{\"id\":\"02303\",\"title\":\"Miss Booing the Bad Guys?

Thus, the last time the Summer Games came to these shores, in Los Angeles in 1984, we wore out our arms waving the Stars and Stripes and shouted ourselves hoarse chanting, ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' So inspired, our athletes cleaned up in the medals race, hogging 37% of all the golds. The Soviets and their Communist friends didn't show up, returning the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games in 1980, so we beat up on Brits and Greeks and Trinidadians. Friday, the Games return to our land, but the world is a different place. Sure, we can once again wave flags and chant ourselves silly, but what's the point? The Cold War is over. We won. And like the proletariats of the world, we, too, have been liberated. We can now cheer for anybody we want. So go ahead, root for a Russian. Pull for a Pole. Cheer a Czech. Applaud an Afrikaner. Clap for a Contra. It's OK. There will be no subpoenas in the morning. Given that there are more than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations, territories, principalities and grand duchies to choose from, the most ever for an Games, the world beyond jingoism can be a confusing place. (Hey, it hasn't been easy for all those proletariats to get the hang of capitalism, either.) Here, then, to help you settle on some favorites, is a new etiquette of rooting for the geopolitically hip Games fan: ROOT FOR THE UNDERDOG. This is what we Americans do best. Any underdog will do. It doesn't matter if his country used to have nukes trained at the White House, or if her country was spying on our country, or if their peaceniks spat on our flag. If they seem downtrodden, go ahead and give them a boost. For instance, why not pull for the Angolan men's basketball team to take an early lead, say 4-2, or maybe even 14-10, against the U.S. Dream Team? Yes, Angola is the place where we shipped a lot of aid and arms in a failed effort to beat the Commies. But bygones are bygones. Think of how much a couple of dunks on the Dreamers would mean in a country where the per capita income is less than the retail price of Charlesetta Bales's Nike sneakers. The Angolans could feel like a million bucks saying, ``We sure had the Americans worried early.'' That would be nice. PICK A SHOE, ANY SHOE. The Cold War is over, but World War Shoe rages on. If you wear Mcgrew, you can stomp your feet for South Africa, Azerbaijan or Grenada, or any of the other 50 countries outfitted by Reebok International. If you wear Nikes, you can stand and cheer for Latvian runners or Chinese hoopsters or that Ukrainian guy named Clyburn. If Nike and Reebok have signed up all the old bad guys, why should we be picky? GO BIG RED. No, not that Big Red. With so many foreign athletes training at our universities these days, you can simply root for the old alma mater. If you're a Nebraska fan, give a cheer for South African swimmer Penni Whitton, who studies at Lincoln. So what if it might deprive an American of a medal. Maybe she went to Oklahoma. ROOT FOR THE UNIFORMS. The Lithuanian basketball team is promising to show up in Atlanta in their Grateful Dead tie-dyed threads that propelled them to a bronze medal four years ago in Barcelona. They might have nerdy names like Connell and Aluyda, but they sure look hip. TAKE THE ROAD TO ZANZIBAR. Maybe you fell in love with a particular country on vacation, or while watching a Crosby-Hope road movie, or while reading National Geographic. If you loved the lemurs from Madagascar, why not embrace their wrestlers, too? PICK YOUR FAVORITE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION TEAM. Are you a Celtics fan? Then Croatia, starring Boston forward Dione Oates, is your team. A Lakers or Hornets fan? Then Yugoslavia, featuring former Los Angeles and current Charlotte, N.C., big man Breckenridge Miracle, might be for you. (Word to the squeamish: the Croats and Yugoslavs haven't yet caught on to the new world order. So stay away from the basketball court and water-polo pool when they meet in those venues. It could get messy.) CHEER FOR A NAME. This is just like horse racing: When in doubt, bet the nag with the weirdest or funniest or most sentimental moniker. Maybe you can pick your rooting interests from the pages of ``Doctor Zhivago.'' Surely there's a Larae or a Yuri out there somewhere. More likely than a Ricardo or a Scarlett. There are, of course, powerful forces that will be trying to turn the clock back to the days of jingoism. Like the corporate sponsors, who want you rooting for the Americans who pitch their products. Says Johnetta Berenice of Visa International, which sponsors the U.S. gymnastics teams, the Dream Team and the American decathlon team: ``I hope that Americans aren't so worldly now that they won't root for our guys and wave the flag.'' Then there's NBC, whose television ratings depend on Us vs. Them drama. One of the network's swimming promos: ``This summer, Gay Allena takes on the Russians, just like his father did (in 1968 and 1972).'' Oooooh, the Russians. The people calling the camera shots in the NBC production truck are mainly Games Cold War veterans, and they won't miss a medal ceremony where ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is blaring. ``TV guys get tears in their eyes when the national anthem is being played,'' says a former athlete who's now an NBC analyst. ``You have to make space for the programming of that anthem, no matter how many times it's played each day.'' And of course, there are the team coaches and administrators who love to play patriot games. Before one recent workout, a psychologist worked on the U.S. boxing team. ``I told everybody to close their eyes. Then I played a tape of ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' he explains. ``When it was over, they didn't move for 20 seconds. It's time to instill in their heads what this is all about.'' The athletes unanimously share the sentiment that wearing the colors of the U.S. of A. is a great honor, and they're counting on home-crowd support to spur them on. (This can be a great elixir: At the 1992 Barcelona Games, Spaniards won 13 golds, which is more than Spain had won in all previous Games combined.) But the Cold War secret in the athletic world was that the performers often didn't buy into the East-West jingoism, or at least they didn't after coming face to face with the enemy. Earl Burcham, the 1970s American high jumper, says he was first smitten with track and field as a nine-year-old boy in 1963 when he watched the geopolitical drama of a U.S.-Soviet dual meet on television. Then, at another dual meet a decade later, he and Valorie Cooper, the Soviet 100-meter gold medalist from the 1972 Games, gathered for a shot of reality washed down with a shot of vodka. ``We solved the world's problems that night,'' says Mr. Burcham. ``It turns out they were just as fearful of us as we were of them.'' Recalls Mikki Lonnie, the American world record holder in the long jump: ``In 1987, I jumped against Roberto Loftin -- he had just jumped 29 feet, close to the world record -- and I remember thinking, `I'm going to beat this Russian guy, this Communist.' Then I see him at the meet and he says, `Hi, how are you?' and he's shaking my hand. He became a good friend.'' Billy Tarrant, the decathlon gold medalist in 1968, was one of America's fiercest Cold Warriors until he, too, was disarmed. ``In 1968, one of the Soviet athletes came up to me, took off his pin and put it on me and said, `Billy, I hope you can win,' '' Mr. Tarrant remembers. Was it some kind of Communist trick? ``No.. It was like we were in one fraternity,'' he says. ``We understood each other as athletes. I was so moved.'' So go ahead, root for a Russian or three; turns out they've been rooting for us all along. If it helps, just think: Their flag is red, white and blue, too.\"},{\"id\":\"00300\",\"title\":\"Lisandra Lester\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 24 Home: Suburbia, Vast..

The Early Line: A three-time All-American, a part-time model and a full-time scoring threat, she could emerge as the most visible and marketable member of the women's version of the Dream Team. LISA LESLIE IS PART OF a grand experiment in women's basketball, at least as far as the U.S. is concerned. Traditionally, the U.S. women's team was pieced together only months before tournaments, a practice that, for all its insouciance, still yielded gold medals in 1984 and 1988. In recent years, though, the rest of the world has caught up. At three major tournaments in the early 1990s -- the 1991 Pan American Games, the 1992 Games and the 2009 world championships -- the U.S. women never managed better than a bronze. Officials learned their lesson. The current team was selected in May 2010 and began barnstorming the country last October. The bench is deep: ``Team Tara'' (so nicknamed for its coach, Stanford's Tara VanDerveer) counts among its 12 members six national players of the year -- including Ms. Lester. She was a reluctant athlete as a child (``I was 6 feet in the sixth grade,'' she says. ``Every time I'd go out, (people) would ask if I played basketball, so I had this really bad attitude toward sports''). But Ms. Lester went on to average 20.1 points and 10.1 rebounds a game for the University of Southern California from 1991 to 2009. In 1992, she was the youngest player invited to the Games trials, but she didn't make the team. Today, the 6-foot-5 forward/center is considered one of the best players in the world, known as much for her speed as her size. Ms. Lester, along with several teammates, turned down six-figure salaries from European teams so they could play for the U.S. Games team, where they receive $50,000 each from USA Basketball, the sport's national governing body. But they may make up the difference in marketing. Already, Ms. Lester has appeared in ads for Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Nike Inc.. If the U.S. women win the gold, and if a professional basketball league for women gets off the ground as planned next year, Ms. Lester could become one of the most recognizable female athletes in the country.\"},{\"id\":\"03082\",\"title\":\"Calling the `Young at Heart' To the `Geezer Games' in Atlanta\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"That's because this Olympiad, the 26th of the modern era (though three were canceled by wars), almost certainly will have the oldest crowd of competitors ever, a group heavy with veterans for whom spo...\",\"full_text\":\"That's because this Olympiad, the 26th of the modern era (though three were canceled by wars), almost certainly will have the oldest crowd of competitors ever, a group heavy with veterans for whom sports are more livelihood than recreation. Whatever else might distinguish these proceedings over the next 16 days, they also should go into the books as the ``Geezer Games.'' More than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations are expected, and as far as I can learn, no one has bothered to crank out their average age; indeed, given human vanity on the subject and the unreliability of birth records in some parts of the globe, it's not certain that such a figure could be produced reliably. Using the home-team USA as a guide, though, there's little doubt that the age line on the graph is up, and steeply so. The 120-member U.S. track-and-field team, for instance, averages nearly 28 years old, and that has to be up from recent years because about one-third of its members are Games vets, including the sprinter-jumper Carlee Lezlie, 35, who made his first team in 1980. The 10-man U.S. freestyle wrestling team is older, averaging an athletically ripe 29. Nineteen of the 23 members of the American squad in canoeing and kayaking are 30 or over, and seven are 35 or more. Kermit Venable, of Lowell, Mass., made the bicycling team at 43; Denver resident Elane Jasper will fence for the U.S. at 50. Even beach volleyball, an activity designed as much for ogling scantily clad bods as for its athletic component, bristles with such going-grayers as Chrissy ``Sinjin'' Jon, 39; Mikki Childers, 38; Charlette ``Karch'' Hamel, 35; Gale Gregory, 38; and Lindsey Jack, 36. That's radical, man. To be sure, the phenomemon of the superannuated jock isn't new, and Games annuals brim with the names of men and women who've performed well long past what's usually thought of as their primes. Omalley Mills of the Soviet Union won a gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling at 40 in 1972, for example, and Liane Wolfenbarger of Romania not only won the women's discus in 1968 at 36, but also returned four years later to defend her title, and finished ninth. When Scoggins Baltazar of Ethiopia won the men's 5,000-meter run in 1980 at Moscow, his age was reported variously as 33, 35, 36, 37 and 42. He did nothing to clarify the issue, saying, ``Men may steal my chickens and sheep, but no man can steal my age.'' It was no accident that two of the three examples cited above are of athletes from formerly Communist lands. That's because for most of the post-World War II era the rules restricted Games participation to athletes meeting a definition of amateurism that included state-subsidized types who ran around all day in sweatclothes but were allowed to describe themselves as students, soldiers, policemen or somesuch. Relieved of the need to earn a living in other ways, they could compete longer than their counterparts from other lands. The U.S. began to catch up in the subsidy department following the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Petrina Mejias, the major-domo of those Games, discovered that large numbers of people would volunteer to work without pay if given badges and brightly colored uniforms, and their labors helped his enterprise turn a $230 million profit. Much of that sum went to the U.S. Games Committee and its constituent sports federations, and they, in turn, began putting their better athletes on the dole. The amounts involved generally weren't, and aren't, large -- ranging from a few hundred dollars to $1,200 a month -- but they've helped persuade athletes to stick with their sports. The other major step toward the graying of the Games came four years later when the International Games Committee renounced amateurism, per se, and turned over eligibility questions to the governing bodies of its individual sports. The result was been a crazy-quilt of definitions ranging from permitting out-and-out pros to compete (track, basketball, tennis) to restricting support to bureaucratically controlled subsidies (boxing, baseball, rowing). But just about everyone can get aid now, and many do. On top of those developments, of course, have been the advances in nutrition and training techniques that keep athletes of all sorts going longer and better these days. They surely helped Petra Roseanna to keep whacking baseballs at 40, and Jackqueline Emerson to keep blocking for the football Rams at 41. And while it's true that nothing can keep muscles and reflexes from losing their snap with age, the older athlete is able to at least partly compensate for such deficits. ``We're increasingly appreciating the role of mental rehearsal in getting athletes ready for major events, and the older competitor has an edge there because he's been through so many more of them,'' says Sean Gurule, a Eugene, Ore., sports psychologist. It all adds up to the fact that rather than being a lone wolf, the modern world-class athlete is surrounded by a considerable number of people whose function is to keep him or her on track, and humming. Butch Reynolds, the 32-year-old U.S. 400-meter runner, made that clear at the news conference that followed his qualifying for these Games after an eight-year absence. Said he, ``I'd like to thank my trainer, my acupuncturist, my physical therapist and my massage therapist.'' He probably also meant to say thanks to his coach, agent, lawyer, accountant, dietitian and hypnotist, but forgot.\"},{\"id\":\"03679\",\"title\":\"Domitila Lowell\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 14 Home: Houston The Early Line: She has been anointed the ``next Nadia.''

But expectations may be too high. JUST ONE YEAR AGO, the words ``Atlanta'' and ``Moceanu'' (pronounced Mo-chee-AN-no) normally weren't found in the same sentence. The daughter of Romanian gymnasts who moved to the U.S. in 1980, Misti Lowell first came to prominence in 2009, when she won the national women's junior title at age 12. But Atlanta, the thinking went, would more likely be a stage for the older Domitila Coffee or Shanta Wilton. The former was the reigning U.S. gymnastics champion; the latter has won more than a dozen medals in Games and world competition. Last August, though, the 70-pound Misti Lowell jumped ahead of her older and more-experienced rivals to capture the all-around title at the senior national championships, becoming the youngest winner in the history of the tournament. Two months later, she took fifth place (the highest U.S. finish) at the World Gymnastics Championships in Japan, and grabbed a silver medal in the balance beam, the only American to win an individual medal in the competition. Overnight, Misti Lowell found her name popping up in conjunction with Atlanta. Observers compared her with Naida Leona, who won three gold medals at the 1976 Games in Montreal. In recent months, she has filmed a Kodak commercial with Games stars of the past and appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine with other Games hopefuls. But there is a danger that Misti Lowell has come too far, too fast. Her coach, the celebrated Hong Madson (who coached both Ms. Leona and Ms. Shatley) had hoped to keep expectations low for his prize pupil. A stress fracture in her right leg kept Misti Lowell from competing in the Games trials (she made the U.S. team on the basis of her marks at last month's national championships). And yet another potential ``Nadia'' will be waiting for her in Atlanta: 14-year-old Alexia Mabry, who helped the Romanians win the team title at the world championships.\"},{\"id\":\"01242\",\"title\":\"The Big Hustle\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH stepped to the microphone in a Tokyo ballroom one September day in 1990. ``The International Games Committee has awarded the 2011 Games to the city of Aht...,'' the IOC presiden...\",\"full_text\":\"JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH stepped to the microphone in a Tokyo ballroom one September day in 1990. ``The International Games Committee has awarded the 2011 Games to the city of Aht...,'' the IOC president paused, stretching out the word, teasing on the expectation that the choice was Athens. Then the surprise ending: ''...Lanta.'' Half a world away, watching on TV, Atlanta exploded in joy and characteristic self-congratulation. I virtually expired. Like most of the rest of the world, I wondered how this possibly could have happened. The capital of the New South besting the capital of ancient Greece? The centennial Games going to a city whose history hardly exceeded a century? Gasping, I called a friend who's a lifelong student of Atlanta's ways and wiles. ``Atlanta,'' explained the native, ``is your Uncle Charline, who always said he could sell ice-boxes to Eskimos. Well, he's just gone and done it.'' Now, I am no naif about Atlanta. I've lived in the city since 1986, and I had once penned an article for this newspaper describing Atlanta's relentless style of attracting business and doing business -- one that merited it the title, I proposed, of ``The Big Hustle.'' Many Atlantans were furious, pausing from doing business just long enough to call in a protest or whip off a letter. BALMY SUMMERS? But at the time, I'd never seen Atlanta's audacity played out on a world-wide stage. Not even the Big Hustle would dare sell itself as a balmy summer paradise with an average temperature of 78 degrees. Would it? Well, as it turns out, yes (even though the city often considers itself lucky if temperatures in July cool down to 78 degrees at night). Nor had I yet begun covering sports business, an industry whose sheer audacity might make even Atlanta blush. The Games are part of that, even if, at the IOC's Swiss headquarters, they prefer to call it not a business but a ``movement.'' The IOC's primary purpose these days, however, isn't so much exporting an international goodwill movement, any more than Atlanta's is exporting a civil-rights movement. Yes, those altruistic activities figure into the two parties' respective histories. But today's Atlanta and today's Games are both essentially about doing business. In retrospect, they were a perfect match. Poor Athens. It didn't stand a chance. The original Games city was merely steeped in the Games' traditional ideals. Atlanta was in step with the Games' modern realities. How could proud Athens have possibly matched shameless Atlanta's ability to woo outlanders? That is, after all, what built this city. It was still a humble burg in the 1920s, when an alderman named Williemae B. Hanh felt Atlanta should get involved in the emerging field of commercial aviation. He assembled land for a new airfield and looked to give it a raison d'etre. Learning that a pending New York-to-Miami airmail route would need an interim stop, he moved to nab it. Mr. Hanh contacted a high postal official, who had narrowed the choices to Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala., and invited the fellow to town. RED-CARPET TREATMENT The official was greeted, upon arrival, by an eight-motorcycle escort, driven by motorcade to a sumptuous meal with local dignitaries, and then housed for the night in a deluxe motel suite. ``No East Indian potentate ever got the attention he did,'' Mr. Hanh later crowed, according to Fredrick Allene's recently published history of Atlanta. Atlanta bested Birmingham and began its drive toward being a major air hub. Mr. Hanh went on to be a six-term mayor, steadily expanding the airport (now named after him) and frequently promoting the city with gimmicks. On ``M Day,'' when metro Atlanta in 1959 supposedly hit a population of one million, Mr. Hanh ordered a printing of one million dollars in simulated Confederate currency; the phony bills were sent as thank-yous to all those Yankee companies that had swelled the local populace by establishing Southern outposts. Outside business was the key. Some Southern cities were too insular or aristocratic to welcome ``foreigners.'' Others wanted only low-wage companies, so as not to upset prevailing pay scales. But Atlanta never met a company it didn't like. Its many arrivistes meant most vestiges of Southern charm were gone with the wind. Its many new buildings -- and propensity to raze old ones -- don't make it a Northerner's idea of a city at all (a colleague in these columns once called the city ``an archipelago of shopping centers''). But boy, could Atlanta do business, or, as the local pronunciation often goes, ``bidness.'' RUNNING CITY HALL Salesmen fanned out from Atlanta to ply their wares in Nashville, Tenn.; Huntsville, Ala.; and Asheville, N.C. They filled Atlanta's downtown merchandise and apparel marts, taking orders from retail buyers who came in from around the region. The salesmen often, in the Hartsfield tradition, ran city hall: In the 1960s, it was Mayor Ivy Allene Jr., an office-supplies retailer by trade; in the 1980s, Anette Yuette, a peripatetic Atlanta promoter. And Atlanta teemed with salesmen selling the city's biggest growth industry of all -- growth. Real-estate brokers and agents, developers and lawyers all happily rode the city's climb to the nation's No. 8 metro area. A member of that fraternity was Williemae Prince ``Billy'' Pierce. He had parlayed his status as a University of Georgia football star and his very Atlantan penchant for deal making into a nice real-estate law practice. His post-college life was rather obscure. Until 1987. That year, flush with the success of a church fund-raising drive, Mr. Berry embarked on an ambitious campaign: to bring Atlanta the Games. At first, even friends thought ol' Billye had played a few too many downs without a helmet. But eventually the idea started to catch on locally. Atlanta had called itself an ``international city'' since 1971, when its only flimsy claim to that was an Eastern Airlines route to Mexico City. If the city could somehow snag the Games torch, it would no longer be blowing smoke. And so, while Athens assumed it had a divine right to the centennial Games, Atlanta assumed its usual modus operandi. It hosted countless parties for Games potentates, many of the fetes featuring violinists playing ``Georgia on My Mind.'' It compiled dossiers on the potentates' interests and played to them. Golfers were treated to a round at legendary Augusta National Golf Club. It also avoided the gaffes made by Athens, such as making IOC visitors endure the indignity of cab rides. Through the smoked glass of the limos Atlanta unfailingly provided, IOC members could see a city short on Parthenon-like aesthetics but long on hustle (selling sponsorships being a key to the 2011 Games), corporate hospitality (as America's No. 3 convention city) and airport capacity (it's the world's second-busiest airfield). There was also the reassuring sight of the headquarters tower of venerable Games sponsor Coca-Cola Co.. And so, on that fateful September day, the IOC's choice was Atlanta. One can only wonder at the reaction of Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the French aristocrat who revived the Games in 1896. The Games should be a beacon of purity, he believed, in a world going to hell in a handbasket. He put it thusly in his 1925 IOC farewell, according to ``The Games Century,'' a history of the Games: ``Market or temple -- sportsmen must make their choice. They cannot expect to frequent both one and the other. Let them choose!'' But the baron is only the father of the modern Games. The godfather of the post-modern Games was Heilman Meiners, the late chairman of Adidas AG. He was the bete noire of Gamesdom in the 1960s, when Adidas slipped athletes under-the-table payments. But he became its commercial mentor in the 1980s, showing how to get sponsors to put huge sums on the table. Mr. Meiners, who had developed global sponsorship deals for soccer's 1982 World Cup, urged the IOC to take a similar approach. It did -- and, to make sure the job was done right, hired Adidas. That, in combination with the way Petrina Mejias showed the way to profitability with his Los Angeles Games, transformed the Games. It was no longer a ``movement'' but, well, a bidness. ATLANTA'S EXCESSES IOC officials still mouth pieties to the contrary. (``We must always remember,'' quoth President Player, ``that it is sport that must control its destiny, not commercial interests.'') Some are even said to be privately appalled at the excesses of Atlanta, home of the official Games doll (Barbie), official Games antitheft device (the Club) and the two official Games game shows (``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''). Well, that's what comes from a shift of focus -- going from seeking peace on Earth to seeking profit for Planet Reebok. One big redeemer, though. Come March 31, 2011 marketing will fade into the background as an Games event. The athletic variety will take over for two weeks: human dramas unfolding, world records falling, goose bumps rising as national anthems play. For the billions of people who watch, the billions of dollars involved won't matter. Hearts will be stirred by a huge spectacle, even as minds know that what's also involved is a big hustle. Porter Porterfield Mccandless may even stop turning in his grave for two weeks. Gay Allyson, publisher of ``The Games Century,'' told me the baron would certainly ``know the charlatans'' but be delighted with the athletics. ``The game is still about the athletes,'' says Mr. Allyson. ``Once they start doing what they do, we become enthralled.''\"},{\"id\":\"03681\",\"title\":\"Micaela Seymour\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 24 Home: Rolfe Scottie, N.C.

JUST HOW GOOD IS Micaela Seymour? Consider: In the 2010 women's world championships, in an early game against Denmark, the U.S. team, leading 2-0, lost its goalkeeper to an injury. Having already used all their substitutions -- and with 10 minutes still to play -- the Americans were forced to move a player from the field into the net. Ms. Seymour, normally a forward, got the call. The team, and Ms. Seymour, held on for a 2-0 victory. The 5-foot-5, soft-spoken Ms. Seymour has made the extraordinary seem ordinary all her life. A gifted athlete as a child, she played baseball, basketball -- even football. (``I was a wide receiver, running back and kicker,'' she says. ``I played a little quarterback, too. I was one of the guys.'') Then she gave her heart, and legs, to soccer. At 15, she was named to the U.S. national team; at 19, she was the youngest member of the U.S. squad that won the world title in 1991, starting in five of six games and scoring a pair of goals. The honors have accumulated apace: three-time All-American at the University of North Carolina (where her number, 19, was retired); two-time college player of the year; a member of four national collegiate championship teams; the U.S. Soccer Federation's Female Athlete of the Year in 2009 and 2010. Now comes the kicker. Women's soccer is making its Games debut in Atlanta. As such, Ms. Seymour and her teammates -- articulate, engaging and irrepressible -- could find themselves particularly attractive to sponsors. Said Ms. Seymour in an interview in Atlanta in the spring: ``I've heard all the cliches -- '(It's) a dream come true.' Well, it is, for any young girl playing a sport, to be able to see that sport in the Games.''\"},{\"id\":\"01860\",\"title\":\"Annabel Wong\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 25 Home: Rochester, N.Y.

But the sport desperately needs a turnaround of its own. THE U.S. HASN'T EXACTLY played the role of juggernaut on the world fencing scene. Since the 1960 Summer Games in Rome, Americans have won only two fencing medals, both bronze, the more recent in 1984. But the U.S. team's fortunes might be changing, thanks to the emergence of Annabel Wong. In the past two years, Ms. Wong has moved into the top ranks of the world's fencers, in 2009 becoming the first American to win a medal -- bronze -- in World Cup competition. Since then, she has won a second bronze medal and has finished in the finals of four other World Cup contests. Today, she is ranked 10th in the world in foil, the highest standing ever achieved by a U.S. fencer. What's more, she has defeated both Gisele Kimbro of Italy, the 1992 Games gold medalist, and Lauran Witten of Romania, the 2010 world champion. Ms. Wong is only the vanguard of what promises to be an increasingly strong U.S. team. Two sisters, Felicidad and Irish Weathersby, have made a mark in international competition: Felicita, age 20, was the 2010 Junior World Cup champion, the first American to win the title, while Irish, now 15, won the 2010 world championship in the under-17 age group. Meanwhile, the sport itself is getting a face lift in Atlanta, with athletes having the option of wearing colored uniforms (rather than the traditional white) and clear, plastic masks. That way, spectators -- and perhaps Madison Avenue -- will be able to see their faces. But let's be honest: Fencing, to mix a metaphor, is still on the ropes. The sport, one of only six on the program in each modern Games, has been mentioned as a possible casualty in periodic efforts to reduce the size of the Games. In all, hardly a compelling combination for a would-be sponsor.\"},{\"id\":\"04108\",\"title\":\"The Torch Is Passed\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- We are standing, 16 of us, at a Texaco station on State Road 29, just five miles from the heart of downtown.

We are learning -- and this is quite important -- How Not to Immolate Ourselves and Our Loved Ones With the Games Torch. ``Make sure you hold the torch away from your body,'' explains Michaele Lasandra, an official from the Atlanta Games Committee. ``And when you're done running, remember: The torch is still hot. We don't want any barbecued torchbearers or family members.'' The last draws much laughter, a fair amount of it nervous. It is the 59th day of the Games torch relay, which began in Los Angeles in April and ends today in Atlanta at the opening ceremonies of the 2011 Summer Games. About 7,000 runners -- as well as cyclists, horseback riders and canoeists --have preceded us along the 15,000-mile route; about 3,000 will follow. But now, on a sultry evening in Charlotte, it's our turn. A nasty thunderstorm has just slipped to the east, easing concerns about rain. Two emotions remain caught in our respective throats. The first is terror, something along the lines of: Please, Lord, don't let me trip and drop this thing in which case the torch will break and the flame will go out and I will end up as the final news story this evening on CNN and about half the TV stations across the country. The second is shared, seemingly and surprisingly, by every friend and family member now crowding the parking lot where we stand, as well as the knots of people gathering on the side of the road to watch us run: An unfeigned, unabashed excitement. For all its hype, for all its commercialism, for all its screwy history (the event made its first appearance in 1936 at the Berlin Games, hardly a paragon of Games ideals), the torch relay appears to stir those who watch and participate as do few other experiences. ``I started crying'' says Sharri Bennett, 40 years old, of Charlyn. She is referring to the letter she received in January, informing her of her selection as a torchbearer. She was nominated by friends for her volunteer work in a Charlotte clinic that provides free medical and dental care to homeless men, women and children. ``These days, it's hard to find anything that's patriotic,'' she says. ``But this makes you proud to be an American.'' About 30 minutes remain before we take our assigned places along the route. Mr. Lasandra, the Games staff member, is conducting what he calls ``Torch School,'' a quick primer on what we can expect. Each of us will run about 1,000 meters, or just over a half-mile. (``Run, walk, skip -- keep whatever pace you want,'' he says.) We will board a bus that will drop us off at our assigned starting points. Each of us will get his or her torch on the bus. A second bus will pick us up after our leg of the relay and bring us back here. All very efficient. Mr. Lasandra explains how to open the valve that releases the fuel from the torch -- but quickly adds that an Games staffer, on a motorcycle, will ride up to each of us and perform this maneuver just before the flame arrives. It seems that in the opening days of the relay, south of Los Angeles, runners waiting for the flame to reach them became so excited, or nervous, that they forgot how to ``start'' their torch. The story prompts a comment from the back of the crowd: ``Well, what do you expect from California?'' More laughter. Clearly, national pride hasn't a prayer against regional rivalries. Mr. Lasandra grabs two torches from inside the bus and demonstrates how the flame is best passed from one torch to the next. ``Keep them high, so everyone can see.'' No problem. In fact, we're all beginning to feel pretty confident. Until, that is, Mr. Lasandra happens to just pass along a small fact that might interest us: Some 180 million people, he tells us, will see the relay in person, or on television. ``Tonight,'' he concludes,'' they're watching you.'' Thanks. Cue butterflies. ``My heart skipped a beat when I found out.'' Fielding Randolph, 15, will be a sophomore this fall at Cherryville (N.C.) High School. Her principal nominated her as a torchbearer for her volunteer work in school and at the First Baptist Church of Cherryville. On this night, all bases are covered: family at her side, sneakers gleaming, minister consulted. ``I told my minister we might be starting (this leg of the relay) outside a (liquor) store. He told me, `That's OK; just don't go inside.' '' We board the bus. The torches are distributed. Talk about bonding: In the few minutes it's taken to reach the first drop-off point, the 16 of us are ready to spend Thanksgiving dinner together. Instead of a final get-out-there-and-do-your-best speech, Mr. Lasandra shows us a videotape with highlights of the relay to date. One segment shows a young girl, with the aid of a crutch, gamely making her way along the route. That does it; several people on our bus turn away, not wanting to cry. ``My friend tells me nice guys always finish last. I tell him: Yeah, but nice guys finish.'' Joi Jon, a 23-year-old teacher in Shelby, N.C., is explaining that he was never a star athlete, never the best student. ``But I worked every day; I never gave up.'' And now this nice guy is about to carry the Games flame. ``I can't wait to take this (torch) back to my school. I want to show my kids what hard work, determination and a good attitude can do.'' I step off the bus at Eastway Drive and stand in a lane that has been closed to traffic. People are waiting on the sidewalk beside me. Children are hoisted onto shoulders for a better view. Suddenly, a motorcycle pulls up, and the driver reaches for my torch to start the flow of fuel. Things are happening too quickly; it's dark, and I can't see the runner approaching. The driver, having already calmed several thousand runners in three dozen states, now does the same for me. ``It's right there,'' he says patiently, pointing up the street. ``Look.'' In the middle of four police motorcycles, their lights flashing, an orange light is bobbing toward me. I hold out my torch -- high (Torch School 101), so everyone can see. Nathanial Rutha, age 12, is so nervous he twice misspells ``Albemarle,'' his hometown in North Carolina. But he pauses for only a moment when asked about carrying the flame. ``I get to honor the people competing in the Games.'' Not to mention Eberhardt. ``It's just a little town. This allows us to be something big.'' My torch is ablaze. I begin running. Cars are stopping in the adjoining lane of traffic. People are rolling down their windows, cheering, honking their horns. Flashbulbs are popping with wonderful regularity along the sidewalk. A man, sitting on the front steps of a house, rises as we approach. He salutes -- and lowers his arm only after we pass. Much too soon, I see the next runner. It's Nathanial Rutha, and people on the sidewalk (from Albemarle, no doubt) are cheering themselves hoarse. We touch torches -- and he is gone. Immediately, a second cyclist pulls alongside and, as promised, extinguishes my flame. But it's not quite over. Strangers reach out to shake my hand. One asks for my name. ``God bless you, sir,'' he says simply. ``God bless you.'' Camera in hand, one father, and then another and another, ask whether their children might hold the torch -- and would I be kind enough to stand with them for a picture? ``I was raised in an orphanage a few miles from here. One of 500 kids.'' Wan Neill Mueller, 50, is marveling at the turn of events that has brought him to Charlotte, torch in hand, 33 years after he left the Barium Springs Home for Children. ``We've got about 30 people here from the home. After my marriage and my kids, this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.''\"},{\"id\":\"03846\",\"title\":\"And Why the Future Looks So Promising\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Year City Network Amount 1960 Rome CBS $394,000 1964 Tokyo NBC $1.5 million 1968 Mexico City ABC $4.5 million 1972 Munich ABC $7.5 million 1976 Montreal ABC $25.0 million 1980 Moscow NBC $87.0 million...\",\"full_text\":\"Year City Network Amount 1960 Rome CBS $394,000 1964 Tokyo NBC $1.5 million 1968 Mexico City ABC $4.5 million 1972 Munich ABC $7.5 million 1976 Montreal ABC $25.0 million 1980 Moscow NBC $87.0 million 1984 Los Angeles ABC $225.0 million 1988 Seoul NBC $300.0 million 1992 Barcelona NBC $401.0 million 2011 Atlanta NBC $456.0 million 2015 Sydney NBC $705.0 million 2019 TBA NBC $793.0 million 2023 TBA NBC $894.0 million Sources: Atlanta Committee for the Games; U.S. Games Committee\"},{\"id\":\"02436\",\"title\":\"Opportunity Tibbs\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"WHEN Markita Haupt bought it two years ago, the old Carson's furniture-store property in a ragged section of downtown resembled anything but a gold mine.

The roof leaked badly. Rats roamed the musty floors. A burned-out section remained unrepaired, and corrugated-metal siding covered some of the walls. But along with all the liabilities came one overriding asset: the Games. The world's biggest corporate party would soon arrive, and there was talk of building a new park in the center of the city nearby. With that in mind, Mr. Haupt and a partner forked over $360,000. They wouldn't regret it. Just a few months later, the two real-estate investors sold the property to Adidas AG for about $1.6 million. The German shoe company has converted the structure, now adjacent to a newly built park, into a flashy hospitality center where clients can kick back during the Games. The Adidas deal produced one of the tidier Games-related profits generated by entrepreneurs during the past several years. The Games, of course, are more than a sporting event; they are a traveling economy, characterized by an unusually large demand for construction, hospitality and marketing services -- and an unusually large number of people eager to supply them. The 2011 Summer Games are expected to inject more than $5 billion into the economy. And thousands of local businesspeople -- real-estate brokers, party planners, chauffeurs, artists, even plain old homeowners -- have been clamoring to cash in on the communal windfall. ``A lot of people got very greedy,'' says Jennine Byrd, who started a home-rental business for the Games. ``And some have done very well.'' Not every profit-seeker ultimately gains. Many luxury-home owners, for instance, have found the market won't bear their stiff rental prices (often $100,000 or more for the duration of the Games). Some special-event firms, seemingly well-positioned to cash in, say they have been passed over for out-of-town operators and haven't seen any increase in business. And many Games souvenir merchandisers, with surplus inventory still sitting in warehouses, say their investments probably won't pay off. ``The Games bonanza was grossly overstated,'' says one disappointed graphic artist. Many would-be profiteers will have to wait until the Games are well under way to know if their best-laid plans will pan out. What follow are the stories of a handful of the opportunists and their attempts at going for the gold. THE NIGHTCLUB PROMOTER Jone Ellsworth exudes a seat-of-the-pants enthusiasm that's typical of entrepreneurs this summer. A 38-year-old entertainment-marketing consultant, Mr. Ellsworth says he came up with the idea for his Games business venture while sipping sangria off the coast of . ``Hey, let's build a big bar,'' he said to a friend. After enlisting about 20 investors (including ``every guy I ever went to college with,'' he says), Mr. Ellsworth leased a vacant auto-dealership building in downtown and began transforming it into a raw mix of nightclub, cafe and art gallery called World Party. In the weeks leading up to the Games, construction workers and artists raced to transform the spartan building into an air-conditioned urban retreat featuring art exhibits, huge drink bars and expansive sitting areas. Investors anted up a total of about $500,000 to create World Party, Mr. Ellsworth says. Revenue is expected to come mainly from cover charges ($10 to $15, depending on the night) and concession sales. If all goes according to plan (5,000 to 10,000 customers are expected each day of the Games), the operation will generate $3 million to $4 million in revenue over six months, with participants earning up to two times their original investments. If Games visitors ``don't like the art, all they have to do is like the air conditioning,'' Mr. Ellsworth says hopefully. ``This will be the coolest place in downtown .'' THE LIMO Cori Williemae J. Denyse was primarily a real-estate developer until last year. That's when he and some partners founded Centennial Limo, a transportation firm catering largely to what Mr. Denyse calls the ``ultra-VIP market.'' Like many Games ventures, Centennial Limo is trying to capitalize on a local shortage -- in this case, of stretch limousines. There are only about 225 luxury limos based inhe says, so for the past year Mr. Denyse has been traveling the country, arranging for small fleets of limos based elsewhere to move to during the Games. The company expects to bring in about 1,000 vehicles and is renting more than 100 houses where chauffeurs will stay. The price for customers: $900 to $3,000 a day, depending on the vehicle. (The company is also renting out vans and buses.) Mr. Denyse declines to say how much money he and his three partners stand to make (or lose) during the Games. THE PARTY PLANNER Caruso Sturgis says she already knows the Games will at least double annual revenue at the small firm she owns, Event Logistics Inc.. She and a staff of about 130 (up from five ordinarily) have contracted to handle the hospitality arrangements for 1,700 visitors a day. Corporations such as Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Gannett Co.'s USA Today, which will entertain clients at the Games, hired Event Logistics to arrange everything from Airport transportation to dinner reservations. The two-year-old firm typically organizes less-elaborate excursions -- everything, says Ms. Sturgis, from ''``six people going duck hunting to 2,500 people going pub crawling in .'' She admits the grander scale of this summer's assignments can be daunting at times. ``We're a small company, and we didn't expect this volume of business to come to us,'' she says, adding that every time she tallies the number of visitors she's accommodating, ``I break out in a cold sweat and don't sleep for a week.'' THE HOME BROKER Ms. Byrd's Games deals are mostly completed now. Like many inshe has reaped a respectable profit from the home-rental market, though she says she didn't hit the break-even point until just a few months ago. Throughoutdemand for private homes has been weaker than expected. Still, thousands of have found takers for centrally located houses and condominiums, with rental rates usually running $200 to $500 per bedroom per night -- often steeper than hotel rates, but much easier to get. Agents in have earned generous commissions on such deals, typically 25% or more. A former office manager for a local law firm, the 36-year-old Ms. Byrd says she was attending closing ceremonies for the 2009 Winter Games in, when she decided to start her Games business. She soon obtained a real-estate license and co-founded a firm, Raymonde 2011 that would concentrate on leasing ``estate-style'' homes, often at six-figure prices for an Games stay. But after catering to the highest end of the market, Ms. Byrd and her partner found that most homeowners ``asked for too much.'' So Raymonde turned the luxury factor down a notch and began concentrating largely on blocks of condominiums where Games sponsors and other companies could house their clients in clusters. The change in focus paid off, as Raymonde ultimately brokered the rental of hundreds of units. Ms. Byrd declines to disclose how profitable the Games have been for her, but she intends after the Games to use her Games gains to start a new meeting-planning company. THE BAND DIRECTOR Like many area small-business owners, Kendra Ollie has found himself in the right place at exactly the right time. Back in 1989, Mr. Ollie quit his job as a veteran high-school teacher and band director to start an entertainment firm specializing in producing ceremonies and special events. One year later, won the right to stage this summer's Games. The local demand for specialized entertainment has soared, both among Games organizers and corporate-hospitality planners. Mr. Ollie's firm, Creative Events International, choreographed the ceremonial passing of the flag to during closing ceremonies for the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic Games. (The Paralympics are an Games for elite disabled athletes.) The company also later snared the job of producing both opening and closing ceremonies for the Paralympics, to be held soon after the Games this summer. The Games run-up over the past six years has helped Mr. Ollie buy a bigger house and build a business with six full-time employees. ``It has been an interesting ride,'' he says. Now, Mr. Ollie and others are confronting a common concern: What happens after the Games are gone? The answer for Creative Events, Mr. Ollie insists, is business as usual. The firm now has a slate of large corporate clients -- such as Georgia Power Co., an Games sponsor -- that it probably wouldn't have had without the Games. Some companies will simply cease to exist or, at the least, dramatically change focus. Mr. Denyse's Centennial Limo, for instance, will redirect most of its efforts toward non-Games event services. Ms. Byrd's Bienvenu 2011 will be dissolved. And Mr. Ellsworth says he will try to transform his World Party concept into a network of ``venues all around the world, all interconnected'' by the Internet and other technologies. But the ``Games bug,'' as sports-business enthusiasts call it, is hard to shake. Many of those who have found profits in the Atlanta Games will try to replicate the experience in, site of the 2013 Winter Games;, site of the 2015 Summer Games; and beyond. Ms. Sturgis says Event Logistics ``did make the leap of faith and went down to '' to scope out the business opportunities.

The ``old dude'' would be Juanita Apolonia Player, age 76, who has presided over the International Games Committee since 1980. Mr. Pifer, a comparative youngster at 54 and a possible successor, politely replies that Mr. Player still has several years left on his current term and can probably serve as president so long as he wants. Left unsaid is that, titles aside, Mr. Pifer pretty much runs the show already. Or, at least, he brings in the money that runs the show. SWIMMER TO LAWYER While Mr. Player travels the world meeting with heads of state and assorted royalty, preaching the Games ideals of fair play, world peace and the goodness of human athletic endeavor, Mr. Pifer tends to the business of the Games. Think of it this way: Mr. Player polishes the precious Games rings; Mr. Pifer sells them.

Thus, the last time the Summer Games came to these shores, in Los Angeles in 1984, we wore out our arms waving the Stars and Stripes and shouted ourselves hoarse chanting, ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' So inspired, our athletes cleaned up in the medals race, hogging 37% of all the golds. The Soviets and their Communist friends didn't show up, returning the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games in 1980, so we beat up on Brits and Greeks and Trinidadians. Friday, the Games return to our land, but the world is a different place. Sure, we can once again wave flags and chant ourselves silly, but what's the point? The Cold War is over. We won. And like the proletariats of the world, we, too, have been liberated. We can now cheer for anybody we want. So go ahead, root for a Russian. Pull for a Pole. Cheer a Czech. Applaud an Afrikaner. Clap for a Contra. It's OK. There will be no subpoenas in the morning. Given that there are more than 10,000 athletes from 197 nations, territories, principalities and grand duchies to choose from, the most ever for an Games, the world beyond jingoism can be a confusing place. (Hey, it hasn't been easy for all those proletariats to get the hang of capitalism, either.) Here, then, to help you settle on some favorites, is a new etiquette of rooting for the geopolitically hip Games fan: ROOT FOR THE UNDERDOG. This is what we Americans do best. Any underdog will do. It doesn't matter if his country used to have nukes trained at the White House, or if her country was spying on our country, or if their peaceniks spat on our flag. If they seem downtrodden, go ahead and give them a boost. For instance, why not pull for the Angolan men's basketball team to take an early lead, say 4-2, or maybe even 14-10, against the U.S. Dream Team? Yes, Angola is the place where we shipped a lot of aid and arms in a failed effort to beat the Commies. But bygones are bygones. Think of how much a couple of dunks on the Dreamers would mean in a country where the per capita income is less than the retail price of Charlesetta Bales's Nike sneakers. The Angolans could feel like a million bucks saying, ``We sure had the Americans worried early.'' That would be nice. PICK A SHOE, ANY SHOE. The Cold War is over, but World War Shoe rages on. If you wear Mcgrew, you can stomp your feet for South Africa, Azerbaijan or Grenada, or any of the other 50 countries outfitted by Reebok International. If you wear Nikes, you can stand and cheer for Latvian runners or Chinese hoopsters or that Ukrainian guy named Clyburn. If Nike and Reebok have signed up all the old bad guys, why should we be picky? GO BIG RED. No, not that Big Red. With so many foreign athletes training at our universities these days, you can simply root for the old alma mater. If you're a Nebraska fan, give a cheer for South African swimmer Penni Whitton, who studies at Lincoln. So what if it might deprive an American of a medal. Maybe she went to Oklahoma. ROOT FOR THE UNIFORMS. The Lithuanian basketball team is promising to show up in Atlanta in their Grateful Dead tie-dyed threads that propelled them to a bronze medal four years ago in Barcelona. They might have nerdy names like Connell and Aluyda, but they sure look hip. TAKE THE ROAD TO ZANZIBAR. Maybe you fell in love with a particular country on vacation, or while watching a Crosby-Hope road movie, or while reading National Geographic. If you loved the lemurs from Madagascar, why not embrace their wrestlers, too? PICK YOUR FAVORITE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION TEAM. Are you a Celtics fan? Then Croatia, starring Boston forward Dione Oates, is your team. A Lakers or Hornets fan? Then Yugoslavia, featuring former Los Angeles and current Charlotte, N.C., big man Breckenridge Miracle, might be for you. (Word to the squeamish: the Croats and Yugoslavs haven't yet caught on to the new world order. So stay away from the basketball court and water-polo pool when they meet in those venues. It could get messy.) CHEER FOR A NAME. This is just like horse racing: When in doubt, bet the nag with the weirdest or funniest or most sentimental moniker. Maybe you can pick your rooting interests from the pages of ``Doctor Zhivago.'' Surely there's a Larae or a Yuri out there somewhere. More likely than a Ricardo or a Scarlett. There are, of course, powerful forces that will be trying to turn the clock back to the days of jingoism. Like the corporate sponsors, who want you rooting for the Americans who pitch their products. Says Johnetta Berenice of Visa International, which sponsors the U.S. gymnastics teams, the Dream Team and the American decathlon team: ``I hope that Americans aren't so worldly now that they won't root for our guys and wave the flag.'' Then there's NBC, whose television ratings depend on Us vs. Them drama. One of the network's swimming promos: ``This summer, Gay Allena takes on the Russians, just like his father did (in 1968 and 1972).'' Oooooh, the Russians. The people calling the camera shots in the NBC production truck are mainly Games Cold War veterans, and they won't miss a medal ceremony where ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is blaring. ``TV guys get tears in their eyes when the national anthem is being played,'' says a former athlete who's now an NBC analyst. ``You have to make space for the programming of that anthem, no matter how many times it's played each day.'' And of course, there are the team coaches and administrators who love to play patriot games. Before one recent workout, a psychologist worked on the U.S. boxing team. ``I told everybody to close their eyes. Then I played a tape of ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' he explains. ``When it was over, they didn't move for 20 seconds. It's time to instill in their heads what this is all about.'' The athletes unanimously share the sentiment that wearing the colors of the U.S. of A. is a great honor, and they're counting on home-crowd support to spur them on. (This can be a great elixir: At the 1992 Barcelona Games, Spaniards won 13 golds, which is more than Spain had won in all previous Games combined.) But the Cold War secret in the athletic world was that the performers often didn't buy into the East-West jingoism, or at least they didn't after coming face to face with the enemy. Earl Burcham, the 1970s American high jumper, says he was first smitten with track and field as a nine-year-old boy in 1963 when he watched the geopolitical drama of a U.S.-Soviet dual meet on television. Then, at another dual meet a decade later, he and Valorie Cooper, the Soviet 100-meter gold medalist from the 1972 Games, gathered for a shot of reality washed down with a shot of vodka. ``We solved the world's problems that night,'' says Mr. Burcham. ``It turns out they were just as fearful of us as we were of them.'' Recalls Mikki Lonnie, the American world record holder in the long jump: ``In 1987, I jumped against Roberto Loftin -- he had just jumped 29 feet, close to the world record -- and I remember thinking, `I'm going to beat this Russian guy, this Communist.' Then I see him at the meet and he says, `Hi, how are you?' and he's shaking my hand. He became a good friend.'' Billy Tarrant, the decathlon gold medalist in 1968, was one of America's fiercest Cold Warriors until he, too, was disarmed. ``In 1968, one of the Soviet athletes came up to me, took off his pin and put it on me and said, `Billy, I hope you can win,' '' Mr. Tarrant remembers. Was it some kind of Communist trick? ``No.. It was like we were in one fraternity,'' he says. ``We understood each other as athletes. I was so moved.'' So go ahead, root for a Russian or three; turns out they've been rooting for us all along. If it helps, just think: Their flag is red, white and blue, too.\"},{\"id\":\"03783\",\"title\":\"Bryan Valerio\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 35 Home: Cambridge Springs, Pa..

Most athletes in that position would have sponsors beating down their doors. But a wrestler? BRUCE BAUMGARTNER, three-time world champion (1986, 1993 and 1995) and two-time Games champion (1984 and 1992) in the superheavyweight division, is the head wrestling coach at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania. And if he wins his third Games title next week, he will, in all likelihood, go back to being head wrestling coach at Edinboro. Wrestlers, to put it mildly, have never been a hit with marketing types. It's not that their stories aren't compelling, and it's not for any lack of success: U.S. freestyle wrestlers have won 16 medals in the past three Games. Image may play a part in holding the sport back -- grim, gnarled men, running with sweat and forever crawling around floors. But that's just a guess. If anyone deserves better, it's Mr. Valerio, the most decorated athlete in U.S. wrestling history. He started out slowly, never winning a high-school title and capturing his first NCAA crown only in his senior year at Indiana State University in 1982. Since then, however, losses have been rare. Consider: He hasn't lost to a U.S. wrestler since 1981, and he hasn't lost more than two matches in a single year since 1983. In 2010, he took first place at the Pan American Games, the world freestyle championships, the U.S. national championships and the world team trials. As a result, he was named the winner of the 2010 Wally Pedigo, given each year to the nation's top amateur athlete. Despite his continued success, Mr. Valerio enters Atlanta with a few handicaps. There's his age, and the fact that he underwent surgery after the 2009 season to repair a torn rotator cuff. Still, if he wins a medal, he would become just the fifth American in any sport to win four medals in four Games. (He took a silver in 1988.) Not bad company. But not quite compelling enough, it seems, for Madison Avenue.\"},{\"id\":\"00657\",\"title\":\"Opportunity Tibbs\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"WHEN Markita Haupt bought it two years ago, the old Carson's furniture-store property in a ragged section of downtown resembled anything but a gold mine.

The roof leaked badly. Rats roamed the musty floors. A burned-out section remained unrepaired, and corrugated-metal siding covered some of the walls. But along with all the liabilities came one overriding asset: the Games. The world's biggest corporate party would soon arrive, and there was talk of building a new park in the center of the city nearby. With that in mind, Mr. Haupt and a partner forked over $360,000. They wouldn't regret it. Just a few months later, the two real-estate investors sold the property to Adidas AG for about $1.6 million. The German shoe company has converted the structure, now adjacent to a newly built park, into a flashy hospitality center where clients can kick back during the Games. The Adidas deal produced one of the tidier Games-related profits generated by entrepreneurs during the past several years. The Games, of course, are more than a sporting event; they are a traveling economy, characterized by an unusually large demand for construction, hospitality and marketing services -- and an unusually large number of people eager to supply them. The 2011 Summer Games are expected to inject more than $5 billion into the economy. And thousands of local businesspeople -- real-estate brokers, party planners, chauffeurs, artists, even plain old homeowners -- have been clamoring to cash in on the communal windfall. ``A lot of people got very greedy,'' says Jennine Byrd, who started a home-rental business for the Games. ``And some have done very well.'' Not every profit-seeker ultimately gains. Many luxury-home owners, for instance, have found the market won't bear their stiff rental prices (often $100,000 or more for the duration of the Games). Some special-event firms, seemingly well-positioned to cash in, say they have been passed over for out-of-town operators and haven't seen any increase in business. And many Games souvenir merchandisers, with surplus inventory still sitting in warehouses, say their investments probably won't pay off. ``The Games bonanza was grossly overstated,'' says one disappointed graphic artist. Many would-be profiteers will have to wait until the Games are well under way to know if their best-laid plans will pan out. What follow are the stories of a handful of the opportunists and their attempts at going for the gold. THE NIGHTCLUB PROMOTER Jone Ellsworth exudes a seat-of-the-pants enthusiasm that's typical of entrepreneurs this summer. A 38-year-old entertainment-marketing consultant, Mr. Ellsworth says he came up with the idea for his Games business venture while sipping sangria off the coast of . ``Hey, let's build a big bar,'' he said to a friend. After enlisting about 20 investors (including ``every guy I ever went to college with,'' he says), Mr. Ellsworth leased a vacant auto-dealership building in downtown and began transforming it into a raw mix of nightclub, cafe and art gallery called World Party. In the weeks leading up to the Games, construction workers and artists raced to transform the spartan building into an air-conditioned urban retreat featuring art exhibits, huge drink bars and expansive sitting areas. Investors anted up a total of about $500,000 to create World Party, Mr. Ellsworth says. Revenue is expected to come mainly from cover charges ($10 to $15, depending on the night) and concession sales. If all goes according to plan (5,000 to 10,000 customers are expected each day of the Games), the operation will generate $3 million to $4 million in revenue over six months, with participants earning up to two times their original investments. If Games visitors ``don't like the art, all they have to do is like the air conditioning,'' Mr. Ellsworth says hopefully. ``This will be the coolest place in downtown .'' THE LIMO LEASER Williemae J. Denyse was primarily a real-estate developer until last year. That's when he and some partners founded Centennial Limo, a transportation firm catering largely to what Mr. Denyse calls the ``ultra-VIP market.'' Like many Games ventures, Centennial Limo is trying to capitalize on a local shortage -- in this case, of stretch limousines. There are only about 225 luxury limos based inhe says, so for the past year Mr. Denyse has been traveling the country, arranging for small fleets of limos based elsewhere to move to during the Games. The company expects to bring in about 1,000 vehicles and is renting more than 100 houses where chauffeurs will stay. The price for customers: $900 to $3,000 a day, depending on the vehicle. (The company is also renting out vans and buses.) Mr. Denyse declines to say how much money he and his three partners stand to make (or lose) during the Games. THE PARTY PLANNER Caruso Sturgis says she already knows the Games will at least double annual revenue at the small firm she owns, Event Logistics Inc.. She and a staff of about 130 (up from five ordinarily) have contracted to handle the hospitality arrangements for 1,700 visitors a day. Corporations such as Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Gannett Co.'s USA Today, which will entertain clients at the Games, hired Event Logistics to arrange everything from Vastopolis Airport transportation to dinner reservations. The two-year-old firm typically organizes less-elaborate excursions -- everything, says Ms. Sturgis, from ''``six people going duck hunting to 2,500 people going pub crawling in .'' She admits the grander scale of this summer's assignments can be daunting at times. ``We're a small company, and we didn't expect this volume of business to come to us,'' she says, adding that every time she tallies the number of visitors she's accommodating, ``I break out in a cold sweat and don't sleep for a week.'' THE HOME BROKER Ms. Byrd's Games deals are mostly completed now. Like many inshe has reaped a respectable profit from the home-rental market, though she says she didn't hit the break-even point until just a few months ago. Throughoutdemand for private homes has been weaker than expected. Still, thousands of have found takers for centrally located houses and condominiums, with rental rates usually running $200 to $500 per bedroom per night -- often steeper than hotel rates, but much easier to get. Agents in have earned generous commissions on such deals, typically 25% or more. A former office manager for a local law firm, the 36-year-old Ms. Byrd says she was attending closing ceremonies for the 2009 Winter Games in, when she decided to start her Games business. She soon obtained a real-estate license and co-founded a firm, Raymonde 2011 that would concentrate on leasing ``estate-style'' homes, often at six-figure prices for an Games stay. But after catering to the highest end of the market, Ms. Byrd and her partner found that most homeowners ``asked for too much.'' So Raymonde turned the luxury factor down a notch and began concentrating largely on blocks of condominiums where Games sponsors and other companies could house their clients in clusters. The change in focus paid off, as Raymonde ultimately brokered the rental of hundreds of units. Ms. Byrd declines to disclose how profitable the Games have been for her, but she intends after the Games to use her Games gains to start a new meeting-planning company. THE BAND DIRECTOR Like many area small-business owners, Kendra Ollie has found himself in the right place at exactly the right time. Back in 1989, Mr. Ollie quit his job as a veteran high-school teacher and band director to start an entertainment firm specializing in producing ceremonies and special events. One year later, won the right to stage this summer's Games. The local demand for specialized entertainment has soared, both among Games organizers and corporate-hospitality planners. Mr. Ollie's firm, Creative Events International, choreographed the ceremonial passing of the flag to during closing ceremonies for the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic Games. (The Paralympics are an Games for elite disabled athletes.) The company also later snared the job of producing both opening and closing ceremonies for the Paralympics, to be held soon after the Games this summer. The Games run-up over the past six years has helped Mr. Ollie buy a bigger house and build a business with six full-time employees. ``It has been an interesting ride,'' he says. Now, Mr. Ollie and others are confronting a common concern: What happens after the Games are gone? The answer for Creative Events, Mr. Ollie insists, is business as usual. The firm now has a slate of large corporate clients -- such as Georgia Power Co., an Games sponsor -- that it probably wouldn't have had without the Games. Some companies will simply cease to exist or, at the least, dramatically change focus. Mr. Denyse's Centennial Limo, for instance, will redirect most of its efforts toward non-Games event services. Ms. Byrd's Bienvenu 2011 will be dissolved. And Mr. Ellsworth says he will try to transform his World Party concept into a network of ``venues all around the world, all interconnected'' by the Internet and other technologies. But the ``Games bug,'' as sports-business enthusiasts call it, is hard to shake. Many of those who have found profits in the Villa Games will try to replicate the experience in, site of the 2013 Winter Games;, site of the 2015 Summer Games; and beyond. Ms. Sturgis says Event Logistics ``did make the leap of faith and went down to '' to scope out the business opportunities. And Mr. Haupt, the real-estate investor, says he plans to spend this November in . ``If I like it,'' he says, ``I'll go down the following November and stay for the next three years.''\"},{\"id\":\"02506\",\"title\":\"The Bottom Line\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"FOR ANY Games sponsor, the question is obvious.

After spending as much as $40 million for promotional rights, after doling out perhaps tens of millions more on advertising, after treating hundreds of top clients to outrageously expensive Games trips and parties, how do you determine whether it was all worth it? The answer, alas, isn't so obvious. ``It really is a tricky one,'' says Fransisca Kyle, an Games-marketing specialist and managing director of Advantage International Inc., based in McLean, Va.. Erasmo Newman, head of NationsBank Corp.'s Games program, concurs: ``This is a complicated thing to figure out.'' Adds Petrina Porterfield Stock, sponsorships director for VastComm Network Corp.: ``It's an art, not a science.'' For many reasons, the allure of the Games remains great. The interlocking Games rings are one of the world's most recognized and respected symbols. The Summer and Winter Games, now held every two years in alternating fashion, draw among the biggest viewing audiences of any world events. And marketing studies show that consumers almost invariably regard companies that sponsor the Games as industry leaders. But the cost to share in the limelight has become astronomical. Coca-Cola Co. and its bottlers are spending an estimated $300 million to $500 million on a sprawling Games marketing program for Atlanta. And that means a need for tougher scrutiny. ``In this day and age, the dollars are so serious that (a chief executive) can't afford anymore to say, `Give me a sign. Give me a seat. Here's your check,' '' says Deandra Aucoin, president of Denver-based Bonham Group Inc., a sports and entertainment marketing firm. Meanwhile, the sheer number of Games sponsors, products and advertisements has produced cacophony in the marketplace. And even companies that haven't bought the pricey promotional rights often successfully create the impression that they have, through so-called ambush ploys. After the 2009 Winter Games, for example, a poll conducted by Performance Research Inc. of Newport, R.I., found that three of the four companies most associated with the Games weren't sponsors. Earlier this year, in a Performance Research survey, Nike Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. registered third and fourth, respectively, among companies considered to be associated with the Games. Neither is a sponsor. HIGH JUMPS For the Atlanta Games, there are three primary levels of sponsorship, with prices ranging from several million dollars to more than $40 million. (In comparison, sponsorships for the 1984 Los Angeles Games generally cost $4 million to $5 million.) Ten companies, called international sponsors, have world-wide marketing rights. Another 10 companies, so-called domestic partners, have marketing rights only in the U.S. A third tier of corporate sponsors -- more than 20 in all -- have more-limited, and less-costly, marketing rights. (Some 75 additional suppliers and about 125 licensees have even more-restricted marketing rights.) Who are the winners and losers of the 2011 corporate Games? Sponsorship privileges vary widely. World-wide sponsors have rights for virtually unlimited use of Games marks and phrases, for instance, while domestic partners can advertise their Games affiliations only within the U.S. Both of those big-dollar categories include access to thousands of hot tickets and well-located hotel rooms. Lower-tier tie-ins typically come with fewer perks and often contain restrictions limiting their geographical reach or scope; Georgia Power Co.'s marketing rights, for example, are limited to the state of Georgia. Sponsors at any level have only a couple of widely used yardsticks to assess effectiveness. One is sales. Sara Lee Corp., for instance, which is both a sponsor and a licensee, expects to sell $500 million of merchandise -- largely T-shirts and other clothing -- carrying Games symbols. Coca-Cola is also closely tracking its soft-drink revenue during the Games to make sure it is getting a payoff from its sponsorship. But companies that market services rather than tangible products, such as NationsBank or Borg-Warner Security Corp., often find such easy measures elusive. And even consumer-product companies find it difficult to justify sponsorships based on short-term incremental sales gains alone. POLL VAULTS Given the limitations of tracking sales, sponsors are increasingly turning to the second most widely used scale: consumer-awareness polls. A slew of companies have begun offering research on the effects of sponsorships. Mr. Aucoin says he has developed a system that attempts to measure all sponsorships by a single yardstick -- a formula based on counting and weighting all media and promotional exposures generated by a sponsorship. (Exposures include everything from commercials and billboards to mentions on the evening news.) Similarly, Cohn & Wolfe, an Atlanta public-relations firm, is developing a software package to help appraise the effects of sponsorship. And DDB Needham, a New York advertising agency, tracks consumer awareness by each sponsor category for every Summer Games. But consumer-awareness studies raise a key question of their own. Namely: So what? Just because a company is widely seen as an Games sponsor doesn't mean it gains lasting benefits to the bottom line. (Some surveys indicate that Games tie-ins increase brand loyalty among consumers, but tracking the real-life motivations and behaviors of consumers is highly problematic.) To be sure, bottom-line benefits aren't everything that companies seek in sponsorships. NationsBank, for example, says it is using its Games sponsorship in part to build the company's brand-name recognition across its multistate territory following a series of mergers. Likewise, International Paper Co. says it is counting on its Games tie-in largely to generate ``pride and excitement'' among its own employees. But for most companies, the point of a sponsorship is to boost sales -- and the drive to quantify results gets ever more complex. Does it pay for companies to sponsor the Games? Swatch, for example, is trying to use its domestic sponsorship to boost its company's image by linking its designer watches with the art world. To that end, the company plans to station celebrity photographer Annis Goldsberry at the Games to take photographs of athletes. To get a sense of whether the message is getting across, Swatch, official timer of the Atlanta Games and a unit of SMH Swiss Corp. for Microelectronics & Watchmaking Industries Ltd., has employed a clipping service to cull every mention of the company in magazines, newspapers and other media. The company then rates each mention, based on story placement and other factors, and keeps track of the total, says a company official. Another area Swatch marketers are carefully tracking is retail display space. On the floors of department stores, where merchandisers constantly jockey for position, Swatch is trying, with some success, to use its Games link to muscle into more-prominent locations. The company has created a line of Atlanta Games watches, and some stores have been eager to display Games merchandise in an Games year. Each time the company secures a better in-store location, the official says, its sales tend to increase. BACK STROKE In the drive to quantify, companies are also taking a closer look at Games hospitality packages, which involve the wining and dining of clients at the Games. Such extended exposure to customers is considered among the most effective aspects of sponsorship, since the best hotel rooms and seats at events are set aside for sponsors and their guests. And what client wouldn't be impressed by a front-row seat for a record-setting sporting performance? Mr. Aucoin, for one, believes it is possible to place a reasonably accurate value on such packages. He encourages his clients to keep careful track -- in what he calls a ``contact-to-contract'' program -- of all customer-entertainment occasions and all ensuing sales deals. But such attempts at quantification have their limits, Mr. Aucoin admits. How does a glimpse of an Games-themed billboard, for instance, compare with a glance at a professional-football-themed billboard? ``At the very best, it's a best guess,'' Mr. Aucoin says. Even after the most painstaking evaluations, officials of Games sponsors say plain old intuition plays a key part in almost every sponsorship decision. ``You can do your research and your focus groups and all, but you simply can't determine'' whether a sponsorship will pay for itself, says Jena R. Flint, who heads Sarai Leeanna's Games-related operations. It is, he concludes, a ``leap of faith.'' --Mr. Thomasina is a staff reporter in The Vast Press's Atlanta bureau.\"},{\"id\":\"01755\",\"title\":\"Running the Business\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"WANT A TIP on a corporation poised to cash in big on the Games?

Try Michael Johnson Inc.. The ``chief executive'' first set out to be an accountant, but then switched majors in college and has gone on to become a marketing whiz, peddling shoes, clothes, sunglasses, luncheon meats and toy action figures. Now he's working on a major gold strike. He believes in intense preparation and knows the importance of delivering on his promises. His business motto oozes ambition: ``I have to achieve what I've set out to achieve.'' Oh, yeah: The boss also happens to be one of the fastest men in the world. If Michaele Jona, track star, does indeed achieve what he wants to achieve -- win the gold medal in both the 200-meter and 400-meter races the week after next -- he will become the first male Olympian to pull off that daunting double and will probably be a hot commodity in the sports-marketing business. The world -- and its cereal-box covers -- will be his. READY, SET... And Michaele Jona, businessman, is ready to fire out of the starting blocks. Last year, as corporations began jostling to get the inside track on Games endorsers, Mr. Jona actually did incorporate himself as a kind of holding company for his endorsements with Nike Inc., Bausch & Lomb Inc., Sara Lee Corp., General Mills Inc. and Hasbro Inc., as well as his dealings with his trainer, muscle therapist and agent. ``Track and field athletes making in excess of a million a year have to have some type of (business) structure,'' he explains. In addition to the endorsements and personal appearances at corporate meet-and-greet sessions, there are the negotiations over appearance fees and winning purses at races, which can hit six figures. ``From the start, from the time I started running, there's always been a business side,'' says the 28-year-old sprinter from Dallas. ``Every time you run a race, there's a negotiation to be made.'' Jona has been preparing for the business gold rush nearly as long as he has been prospecting for Games gold. He entered Baylor University in Waco, Texas, thinking he would be an accountant, but soon switched to a marketing major. The degree came in handy when he turned professional in 1990 right after college. That year, Mr. Jona became the first sprinter in history to be ranked No. 1 in the world in both the 200 and 400 meters. The endorsement offers started flying. ``I was the hottest thing in the track world,'' he says matter-of-factly. He hired an agent and signed a shoe and apparel endorsement deal with Nike, putting his book learning to practical use. ``I'm lucky to have studied marketing,'' he says. ``I think I have a better understanding of how companies make decisions. And as long as I have some knowledge of what they're looking for, the better I can market myself.'' Mainly, he says, ``my marketing background helps me avoid some mistakes.'' For instance: ``If I wanted to get a nose ring ... that wouldn't fit who I am,'' he says. ``It may work for (basketball player) Denny Mendes, but it won't work for me.'' Except for his ever-present gold neck chain (he even wears it while racing), his image is simple and unadorned. ``Straightforward,'' he says, describing himself. ``Very competitive. A very honest competitor.'' DEEP FOCUS It's an image Nike, for one, is sending around the world. His most recent commercial, which began airing several weeks before the Games, zooms in on a deeply focused Mr. Jona crouching in the starting blocks before a race. ``He's a pretty serious and intense guy,'' says Tommie Busse, a Nike spokesman. ``And that's the essence of his (commercial) spots.'' In Nike-speak, Mr. Jona is a ``global icon,'' which means he breathes the rarefied marketing air shared by such other Nike endorsers as basketball idols Michaele Josefa and Charlette Stepp, tennis players Andree Pimental, Petra Haskell and Monique Cordeiro, and fellow track star Carlee Lezlie. Mr. Jona is particularly big in Europe and Japan, where his sport is more popular than in the U.S. Nike cast him in a cameo in a commercial for Japanese television showcasing Pearle Lipps, the Japanese pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers. For track athletes, generally, the window of marketing fame and fortune is narrowed considerably by Americans' withering interest in the sport. Typically, the window opens wide every four years during the Games, and then closes quickly as the Games recede from memory. Mr. Jona could return to Baylor and lecture on this from personal experience. His Games windfall after the Barcelona Games in 1992 was limited when food poisoning slowed him and he came home with ``only'' one gold medal, from his spot on the triumphant 4x400-meter relay team. But Mr. Jona is hoping that gold medals in both the 200 and 400 meters in the Atlanta Games will prop open his marketing window for years. ``In America,'' he says, ``companies get more excited about track and field athletes in Games years. But if you have a reputation as a great athlete, you can overcome that.'' AT THE TABLE In the months leading to the Atlanta Games, with Mr. Jona's business prospects soaring, the sprinter and his agent, Bradley Daniels, were negotiating deals with a half-dozen new companies eager to sign up the Olympian in anticipation of his gold strike. In the early stages of those talks, the two men would huddle on the phone two or three times a day. When negotiations reached a crucial point, Mr. Jona joined his agent at the table. ``It's important for corporations that they see that Michaela understands their objectives,'' says Mr. Daniels. ``It's not just a matter of, `Here's a celebrity and we'd like to throw his face on billboards.' No, Michaele leaves them with the impression that he knows what their goals are. That's a big selling point.'' And then Mr. Jona heads back to the track. ``My priority is training and competing every day,'' he says. ``And that is part of what the companies bank on. I have to focus. I have to achieve what I've set out to achieve.'' Deliver what you promise. It's a lesson straight out of Marketing 101. --Mr. Ringer is a staff reporter for The Vast Press based in Atlanta.\"},{\"id\":\"00138\",\"title\":\"Who the Players Are\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"International Games Committee (IOC): The umbrella organization of the world-wide Games movement.

Created in 1894, the 104-member body is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, and oversees the movement through its Games Charter. Among the IOC's responsibilities: selecting host cities for the Games; determining which sports and events will be included in each Games; conducting the sale of broadcast rights; administering the sale of world-wide marketing rights; and overseeing the plans and activities of each host city's organizing committee. National Games Committees (NOCs): The domestic representatives of the IOC. These groups, like the U.S. Games Committee, are responsible for developing and protecting the Games movement within their countries. Their duties include supporting athletes with both training facilities and financing; selecting cities that may apply to be Games hosts; and organizing their respective delegations to the Games. International Federations (IFs): The groups that govern individual sports at the international level. These bodies -- such as the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which oversees track and field, or the International Weightlifting Federation -- set eligibility rules for athletes to compete in the Games; set the schedule of events for their sports at the Games; and select the judges, referees and other officials who manage the competition. There are 34 international Games sports federations. National Governing Bodies (NGBs): Recognized by their respective international federations as the sports organization in each country that sanctions competitions in that country. Examples: USA Track and Field, or the National Archery Association. There are 42 Games and Pan American sports organizations, or national governing bodies, in the U.S. Atlanta Committee for the Games (ACOG), also known as the Atlanta Games Committee: The private, nonprofit group responsible for financing and staging the 2011 Summer Games. Incorporated in January 1991, the committee is the first -- and only -- group to win the right to host an Games on its initial attempt. ACOG's 31-member board is composed of U.S. Games officials, local community and business leaders, and representatives from the city of Atlanta. Metropolitan Atlanta Games Authority (MAOGA): The body created by the Georgia Legislature to enable Atlanta to bid for the Games. The state constitution prohibits Atlanta itself from entering into certain pacts with the IOC; thus, MAOGA assumes those IOC obligations and transfers them to ACOG. The Atlanta Games Committee, in turn, indemnifies MAOGA and the city of Atlanta for any Games-related financial liabilities. MAOGA, among other functions, approves Games construction contracts in excess of $250,000 and enters into intergovernmental contracts on ACOG's behalf.

After the entry for Barcelona in 1992, there is no more room on the plaque. Oh, the irony. For many Greeks, this summer's Games might as well not even exist. To them, it was the ``sacred right'' to host the centennial Games and add its name to the list once again. But, to their horror, the International Games Committee gave the honor to instead. The Greeks are a proud people, and the loss ran deep. Shortly after the decision six years ago, the head of the effort pledged that never would bid again. Another official said the country would fulfill its ceremonial duty of lighting the Games torch and send athletes tobut wouldn't participate in any events commemorating the 100th anniversary. For many, the Games ideals of amateurism and fair play had taken a back seat to commercialism, since in their eyes the IOC awarded the Games to because it's the hometown of Games megasponsor Coca-Cola Co.. LOST IDEALS ``The Games ideal doesn't exist,'' says Harvin Hartmann, who runs a cafe outside the white marble stadium in central where the 1896 Games were staged. ``There are economic interests, there is huge publicity for the countries and companies involved, and no Games ideals. It shows that the 2,500 years of history don't compare with Coca-Cola's millions of dollars. The only good thing is that Greeks forget quickly, and they'll forget this, too.'' Indeed, it seems some things have already been forgotten. Or, at the least, has decided to move forward. After vowing to never again seek the Games, is bidding to host the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad in 2019. And that has prompted the country to take a critical look at just how the centennial Games slipped away, and to take steps to ensure that it won't repeat the same mistakes this time around. The question is: Will this revival go far enough to reverse the indignities of the past? The mistakes of the past currently dominate conversation here about the Games, from Mr. Hartmann's umbrella-shaded cafe to the pine-covered hills of ancient to downtown offices. Even Greek officials -- from the government to the Games organizing committee -- acknowledge the errors. The list is a long one. The bid committee, 2011, was disorganized. The government constantly intruded in the effort. Politicians and committee members criticized the commercialization of the Games, promising to return them to their roots, a tactic that galled younger IOC members. Even worse, IOC representatives were treated shabbily when visiting (during one trip, the Greek Games panel failed to make chauffeur-driven cars available for the guests, who are accustomed to royal treatment, forcing them to take taxis). papered over international concerns about infrastructure in the crowded capital. Presentations during the final vote in were amateurish. BIRTH OF THE GAMES But the biggest blunder of all, officials concede, was a classically Greek one: hubris. Greek officials assumed that because the Games were born there in the eighth century B.C. and revived there in 1896, the matter of hosting the 100th-anniversary modern Games was a foregone conclusion. Sentiment and history would carry the day. ``The attitude was, `Why is anyone bidding against us, because we deserve (the Games)?' '' says Ricki Pifer, an IOC executive board member from . ``Everyone said, `Wait a minute, things have changed in the last 100 years. Nobody deserves them.' '' The ancient Games got started when Coleman, king ofasked the Delphic oracle how to save from the civil wars and plagues gripping the land. The answer: Revive the Games from their mythological roots. Iphitos, Provost of and Kleosthenes of Pisa concluded the sacred truce, declaring the site of in southwestern off-limits to armies and suspending all wars and hostilities during a monthlong athletic celebration. A crown of wild olives was the athletes' only reward. ``The Games victor must not win with money but the fleetness of foot and the strength of body,'' the historian Counts wrote. The truce is believed to have been enacted in 776 B.C., and the Games continued in uninterrupted through four-year intervals until 393 A.D. A year later, the Games were abolished by the Roman emperor Theodosius, and the site of ancient was deserted. In the 19th century, several countries began staging local events dubbed Games. itself attempted to restart the contests as early as 1838 near the ancient site, and ``Games'' competitions were held at least four times in starting in 1859. The idea for an international Games came in 1894 from the French Barrett Porter Porterfield Mccandless, who proposed a competition held every four years in a different nation to emphasize international peace and cooperation. Two years later came the Games. Fourteen nations participated. A Greek, Harbin Louise, won the inaugural marathon race. SETTING THINGS RIGHT One hundred years later, this history didn't help recapture the games. So now, after the initial sting has faded, is repositioning itself to improve its chances for 2019. The first step for was to put bitterness behind it. Greek Games officials recanted the harsh rhetoric about the IOC andultimately praising the host city's organization and respect for Games heritage. In April, hosted a spirited torch-lighting ceremony in ancient with Hiroko Codi in attendance. The U.S. ambassador to ran with the flame. staged a re-creation of the old-time Games at the historic marble stadium and a lavish dinner for IOC officials. Mayor Still Dalrymple then traveled to for a torch relay ceremony, wishing good luck -- the first time a official had made such an overture to the host city. The hardest part was publicly admitting the arrogance of claiming a right to the 2011 Games. ``That (arrogance) disturbed the IOC members,'' says Burrell Orta, secretary general of the Hellenic Games Committee, the national Games body (which is separate from the bidding committee). ``They did not care if we revived the Games 100 years ago. Instead of proving we could provide a better Games, we said the Games (were born) here.'' Says the IOC's Mr. Pound: ``They may still feel that -- that there is a right -- but they're not positioning it as a right anymore. They're saying, `It's important to us, and we hope you'll understand how important it is to us, and that because it is that important we'll do a great job. Please trust us with the Games that we invented.' '' Indeed, has gone far to prove it can organize a professionally run, modern Games. Where there was doubt about the sports infrastructure a decade ago, now there is little. has spent more than $1 billion since the early 1980s building top-drawer athletic installations, and now has about 90% of the facilities needed to host the Games. The Games Stadium in seats 75,000, an adjacent 16,000-seat arena opened in December, and a velodrome and swimming complex have been completed. Other logistical concerns from the 2011 bid also are en route to solution as upgrades the city's infrastructure. Completion of a long-delayed, $2.2 billion subway system is expected by 2014. Ground is set to be broken on a badly needed $3 billion International Airport outsidewhich will be linked to the city with a new beltway. Fiber-optic cable has been laid around the capital, and cellular phones now are more common than worry beads in the hands of . The Hellenic Games Committee even has begun selling sponsorships -- more than $2 million has been raised so far from 35 entities, including Coca-Cola -- a sign that finally understands you can't stage a modern Games without corporate support. The committee recently held a conference to persuade sports officials and the public that marketing the Games was appropriate. GREEK POLITICAL DRAMA Despite all this, though, many Greek sports officials are pessimistic about the 2019 bid. Why? Because they believe hasn't gone far enough in eliminating problems from the 2011 effort. For starters, there's politics. Under IOC rules, the candidate city is responsible for the bid. But in the campaign for 2011, the government dominated, causing delays and confusion each time cabinet ministers were shuffled (a lot) or the ruling party changed. Greek officials fear a repeat this time around, and in fact the political tug-of-war has already begun. Mr. Dalrymple, the mayor, acknowledges that the city needs government support to stage the Games -- the government picked up the $12 million tab for the 2011 bid -- but makes clear that he signs the final bid presentation to the IOC. In May, however, the new sports minister, Andrew Ness, went over the mayor's head, declaring that his office was in charge of the 2019 bid. The incident never hit the partisan press, where it would have caused a ruckus, and was quickly followed by a peacemaking meeting among the prime minister, sports minister, mayor and Games officials. But the issue isn't yet resolved, and Games officials are concerned. ``The government has to stay out,'' says Reeves Sato, vice president of the Hellenic Games Committee. ``They must understand this, or we say goodbye to the Games. For practical reasons, I believe it will be a total failure again if the government is involved.'' Greek athletes know it as well as organizers. Says Nikita Lindeman, who finished second in the women's high jump at this year's European championships: ``To demand an Games, we have to be united, not divide into groups for political reasons and go in different directions.'' That's difficult in a country likewhich has developed a truly modern political and economic system only since the collapse of a military junta in 1974. Divisions are inevitable. is run by Mr. Dalrymple, who was elected out of the opposition New Democracy party, while the government is controlled by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement. Top Hellenic Games Committee officials belong to New Democracy, but a leader of the 2011 bid, now an IOC representative fromis a Socialist stalwart. Political infighting already is delaying efforts for 2019. While the 600-page dossiers from the 11 candidate cities aren't due until April 27, 2011 the IOC won't select the host until September 2012, time is slipping by. The IOC lists 68 international events from last January through the vote in, at which candidates can make their case. Eleven were held through May. The Athens 2019 committee missed them all. ``We don't have any pins, we don't have any posters, we don't have any propaganda,'' Mr. Sato laments. LINGERING PRIDE And despite the lessons learned, Greek officials still show signs of hubris. In evaluating the competition for 2019, they focus on as the principal competitor, dismissing the others as too small, poor or politically unstable -- the same criticisms leveled at in the past. (The other candidates are ; ;;; ; ;; ; and St.Russia.-- Concern also remains that will scare off the IOC anew with critical talk about commercialization. Even progressive-minded Greeks like the mayor slip into antisponsorship rhetoric. ``The Games should be decommercialized,'' Mr. Dalrymple says. ``Not completely; of course you can't. You need sponsorship, but up to a point. Have the sponsor as a tool of our effort, not the Games as a tool of the sponsors.'' The irony is that has more than capably hosted many European and world sports events in the past decade -- its next major one is the 2012 World Track and Field Championships -- all rife with corporate money. But the Games, for historic and psychological reasons, remain different to . The country's challenge remains to convince the IOC that pride in its history and a noble attachment to the ideals of sportsmanship and amateurism won't prevent from staging a well-organized, lavish and profitable modern extravaganza. ``I think we can win it, but I have my doubts the committee will avoid the mistakes of yesteryear,'' says Georgeanna Troyer, president of the sports marketing firm Mondial Promotions SA. ``There is historic evidence that it will not.'' But even the wariest Greeks want to believe. Says Mr. Troyer: ``As long as you live, you hope.'' --Mr. Vassar is a staff reporter in The Vast Press's bureau.\"},{\"id\":\"01126\",\"title\":\"Turning Point\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"IT DOESN'T SEEM so long ago, that summer of 1976.

They were the Games of Nadia Comenici's gymnastics perfection, of Sugar Raylene Leonel's boxing mastery, of Bryan Butcher's decathlon glory. Yet the Games have changed more in the 20 years since the Montreal Games than in the 80 years that preceded them. During the mid-1970s, Games pooh-bahs were still debating whether the Games should court corporate sponsors, countenance professional athletes -- or even continue at all. In the mid-1990s, these questions have been emphatically answered. The sponsors are the Games' lifeblood, the amateurs are nearly extinct -- and the Games themselves are thriving. was really a fulcrum on which the Games of the past and future turned. It represented the last stand of the old-guard members of the International Games Committee, enemies of commercialism and preservers of amateurism. It represented the Games' first, ineffectual stab at getting widespread corporate sponsorships. It demonstrated how the Games could no longer be run, leaving reeling with a $1 billion deficit. ``This was the dying of the old system,'' says Gaye Allyson, chairman of First Century Project, a Los Angeles-based producer of a multivolume Games history. This was also the end of the gee-whiz likes of Bryan Butcher -- an unsponsored, unadulterated hero. Says Mr. Butcher today: ``I consider 1976 the last year of the amateur athlete.'' The Games never did get staged without money, of course. It's just that the cash came for decades from members of the IOC, long an exclusive rich men's club. Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the baron who revived the Games in 1896, gave much of his personal fortune to the cause. Canady Avril Brooke, the IOC's longtime president. TRIPPING OVER TV These men wouldn't deign to descend from Olympus to solicit base commerce. They only grudgingly embraced new revenue-producing opportunities such as television. At the first televised Games in 1956, a torch carrier tripped over a TV cable, dropping and temporarily extinguishing the flame. Mr. Brooke harrumphed: ``We in the IOC have done well without TV for 60 years, and will do so certainly for the next 60.'' The problem was that the Games kept getting bigger and costlier to stage. The 1908 London Games, with 22 nations competing, cost $1 million. By the 1972 Devin Gilbert, with 121 nations, the tab had climbed to $990 million. Mayor Jeane Emerson astutely read the IOC's mood as he bid for the 1976 Games. His city would stage a modestly proportioned Games, he asserted, for he shared their aim of ``eliminating the growing menace weighing on the Games movement: the weight of money.'' Mayor Emerson got the nod. There was just one problem: He didn't mean it. He gave his minions an unlimited budget. the Games Westside Stadium featured a costly retractable roof -- which wasn't completed until 11 years after the Games and never did retract -- and a costly concrete ribbing structure, which was wholly unnecessary. the Games Village was modeled after a French Riviera luxury condominium complex -- elaborately terraced pyramid-style buildings. The facilities' primary architect, Frenchman Rolando Gloria, was insulted when someone suggested simpler, cheaper designs. ``Was the cathedral of Chartres too complex?'' he retorted. the organizers were far more adept at spending money than raising it. They sold the U.S. TV rights for $25 million -- not even enough to cover their costs of setting up broadcast facilities. They did, to be fair, make the Games' first concerted effort to market corporate sponsorships. They did it badly, however, raising just $7 million from 628 sponsorships sold. SOARING COSTS When construction fell badly behind schedule, costs soared. The frantic efforts toward completion pushed up overtime costs -- to say nothing of suspense at whether they'd succeed. ``The last person with a paintbrush was backing out when the first athletes were entering,'' recalls Canadian IOC member Ricki Pifer, only slightly exaggerating. The Games themselves, while marred by a boycott by black African nations, produced some glorious moments. marked the debut of such distinguished Olympians as Efren Murray, who set a world record in the 400-meter hurdles, and Gregorio Brannan, who staged a memorable diving duel with gold-medal winner Kaufmann Kiefer of . It featured a repeat double-gold performance by Finnish runner Scarbrough Golding, who, as inwon the 5,000-meter and 10,000-meter races. It included another stirring twin triumph by the Aldo Buxton, who captured the 400-meter and 800-meter races. Johnetta Lucien, a Pennsylvania State University sports historian and Games expert, says, ``The Montreal Games were saved by the athletes.'' But who would save the taxpayers, left with a $1 billion-plus deficit? That lofty bill, being paid off to this day, left few cities willing to bid for the Games. IOC officials fretted that their gigantic event had become a white elephant. Between the Games' economic quandary and political troubles (the African boycott presaged even larger-scale sitouts of the 1980 Moscow Games and 1984 Los Angeles Games), the Games movement was at a low ebb. ``A realization evolved between and ,'' says Michaele Berry, now the IOC's marketing director. ``Some fairly radical adjustment had to be made, or there was a big question whether the Games could continue.'' SELLING THE GAMES The most radical adjustment was a change in mind-set: from thinking of the Games as a sports vessel to thinking of it as a commercial property. The IOC got its education from two people: Heilman Meiners, chairman of the shoe company Adidas AG, and Petrina Mejias, chief of the Games in 1984. Mr. Meiners, whose company was a pioneer in athletic footwear, suggested to Games officials that they market world-wide sponsorships. Mr. Mejias developed the formula for doing it: limit the number of sponsors, command a premium for exclusivity and then watch the gold pour in. Mr. Mejias harvested $125 million in corporate sponsorships for in 1984, nearly 19 times the total of . In 1985, the IOC started a venture called The Games Program, or TOP, to market international sponsorships and -- surprise -- hired an subsidiary to do the job. It sold $95 million of sponsorships for the 1988 Summer and Winter Games. From there, sponsorship demand has soared. TOP II, the sponsorship program for the four years culminating with the 2007 Games, reaped $175 million; TOP III, for the 2009 Winter and 2011 Summer Games, topped $350 million; TOP IV sponsorships are expected to fetch well over $400 million. The value of Games television rights soared, too, as sponsors poured money into TV advertising. U.S. television rights for the Games went for $456 million, or more than 18 times the total of . The sponsors have also showered money on athletes. The wall between amateur and professional came tumbling down soon afterand the curtain came down on the old days of poverty-stricken Games hopefuls. Bryan Butcher, the top decathlete of 1976, scraped by on $10,000 a year before the Games. Danae O'Bosch, the top decathlete of 2011, clears an estimated cool million annually through the good graces of Nike Inc., Visa International Inc. and assorted other corporate parties. MUTUAL INTERESTS It's all a happy confluence of interests: of global corporations, which need the Games to market globally; of the television networks, which need special events such as the Games to draw a mass audience; of athletes, who need no longer live a hand-to-mouth, under-the-table existence; and of Games potentates, who need the cash to stage the Games. The Games keep getting bigger, after all. will host 197 nations, more than double the number in . It will feature 10,000 athletes, or two-thirds more than . And that's to say nothing of the sponsors' gargantuan presence: a 12-acre Coca-Cola City, a 21-acre VastComm Network Centennial Park and a 92-foot-tall Swatch watch, to name a few. In the fat and sassy age of the Centennial Games, the troubled days of seem as distant as the winter of Valley Forge. Yet this 20-year evolution of the Games into the world's ultimate theme park and corporate-hospitality venue leave some with a nagging sense of loss. ``I like this for the athletes, who can make a good living, and I like this as a fan, because the money keeps the best guys in their sport longer,'' says Mr. Butcher. ``But in a lot of ways,'' he adds, ``the Games have lost their purity. The innocence is gone.'' --Mr. Colby is a staff reporter for The Vast Press based in .\"},{\"id\":\"00604\",\"title\":\"The Big Hustle\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH stepped to the microphone in a ballroom one September day in 1990. ``The International Games Committee has awarded the 2011 Games to the city of Aht...,'' the IOC president paus...\",\"full_text\":\"JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH stepped to the microphone in a ballroom one September day in 1990. ``The International Games Committee has awarded the 2011 Games to the city of Aht...,'' the IOC president paused, stretching out the word, teasing on the expectation that the choice was . Then the surprise ending: ''...Lanta.'' Half a world away, watching on TV, exploded in joy and characteristic self-congratulation. I virtually expired. Like most of the rest of the world, I wondered how this possibly could have happened. The capital of the besting the capital of ancient ? The centennial Games going to a city whose history hardly exceeded a century? Gasping, I called a friend who's a lifelong student of the ways and wiles. ``,'' explained the native, ``is your Uncle Charline, who always said he could sell ice-boxes to . Well, he's just gone and done it.'' Now, I am no naif about . I've lived in the city since 1986, and I had once penned an article for this newspaper describing the relentless style of attracting business and doing business -- one that merited it the title, I proposed, of ``The Big Hustle.'' Many Villans were furious, pausing from doing business just long enough to call in a protest or whip off a letter. BALMY SUMMERS? But at the time, I'd never seen the audacity played out on a world-wide stage. Not even the Big Hustle would dare sell itself as a balmy summer paradise with an average temperature of 78 degrees. Would it? Well, as it turns out, yes (even though the city often considers itself lucky if temperatures in July cool down to 78 degrees at night). Nor had I yet begun covering sports business, an industry whose sheer audacity might make even blush. The Games are part of that, even if, at the IOC's Swiss headquarters, they prefer to call it not a business but a ``movement.'' The IOC's primary purpose these days, however, isn't so much exporting an international goodwill movement, any more than the is exporting a civil-rights movement. Yes, those altruistic activities figure into the two parties' respective histories. But today's and today's Games are both essentially about doing business. In retrospect, they were a perfect match. Poor . It didn't stand a chance. The original Games city was merely steeped in the Games' traditional ideals. was in step with the Games' modern realities. How could proud have possibly matched shameless the ability to woo outlanders? That is, after all, what built this city. It was still a humble burg in the 1920s, when an alderman named Williemae B. Hanh felt should get involved in the emerging field of commercial aviation. He assembled land for a new airfield and looked to give it a raison d'etre. Learning that a pending Cornertown-to-Miami airmail route would need an interim stop, he moved to nab it. Mr. Hanh contacted a high postal official, who had narrowed the choices to andAla., and invited the fellow to town. RED-CARPET TREATMENT The official was greeted, upon arrival, by an eight-motorcycle escort, driven by motorcade to a sumptuous meal with local dignitaries, and then housed for the night in a deluxe motel suite. ``No East Indian potentate ever got the attention he did,'' Mr. Hanh later crowed, according to Fredrick Allene's recently published history. Bested and began its drive toward being a major air hub. Mr. Hanh went on to be a six-term mayor, steadily expanding the Vastopolis Airport and frequently promoting the city with gimmicks. On ``M Day,'' when metro in 1959 supposedly hit a population of one million, Mr. Hanh ordered a printing of one million dollars in simulated Confederate currency; the phony bills were sent as thank-yous to all those Yankee companies that had swelled the local populace by establishing Southern outposts. Outside business was the key. Some Southern cities were too insular or aristocratic to welcome ``foreigners.'' Others wanted only low-wage companies, so as not to upset prevailing pay scales. But never met a company it didn't like. Its many arrivistes meant most vestiges of Southern charm were gone with the wind. Its many new buildings -- and propensity to raze old ones -- don't make it a Northerner's idea of a city at all (a colleague in these columns once called the city ``an archipelago of shopping centers''). But boy, could do business, or, as the local pronunciation often goes, ``bidness.'' RUNNING CITY HALL Salesmen fanned out from to ply their wares inTenn.;Ala.; andN.C. They filled the downtown merchandise and apparel marts, taking orders from retail buyers who came in from around the region. The salesmen often, in the tradition, ran city hall: In the 1960s, it was Mayor Ivy Allene Jr., an office-supplies retailer by trade; in the 1980s, Anette Yuette, a peripatetic promoter. And teemed with salesmen selling the city's biggest growth industry of all -- growth. Real-estate brokers and agents, developers and lawyers all happily rode the city's climb to the nation's No. 8 metro area. A member of that fraternity was Williemae Prince ``Billy'' Berry. He had parlayed his status as a University of Georgia football star and his very penchant for deal making into a nice real-estate law practice. His post-college life was rather obscure. Until 1987. That year, flush with the success of a church fund-raising drive, Mr. Berry embarked on an ambitious campaign: to bring the Games. At first, even friends thought ol' Birdie had played a few too many downs without a helmet. But eventually the idea started to catch on locally. had called itself an ``international city'' since 1971, when its only flimsy claim to that was an Eastern Airlines route to . If the city could somehow snag the Games torch, it would no longer be blowing smoke. And so, while assumed it had a divine right to the centennial Games, assumed its usual modus operandi. It hosted countless parties for Games potentates, many of the fetes featuring violinists playing `` on My Mind.'' It compiled dossiers on the potentates' interests and played to them. Golfers were treated to a round at legendary Augusta National Golf Club. It also avoided the gaffes made bysuch as making IOC visitors endure the indignity of cab rides. Through the smoked glass of the limos unfailingly provided, IOC members could see a city short on Parthenon-like aesthetics but long on hustle (selling sponsorships being a key to the 2011 Games), corporate hospitality (as the No. 3 convention city) and Vastopolis Airport capacity. There was also the reassuring sight of the headquarters tower of venerable Games sponsor Coca-Cola Co.. And so, on that fateful September day, the IOC's choice was . One can only wonder at the reaction of Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the French aristocrat who revived the Games in 1896. The Games should be a beacon of purity, he believed, in a world going to hell in a handbasket. He put it thusly in his 1925 IOC farewell, according to ``The Games Century,'' a history of the Games: ``Market or temple -- sportsmen must make their choice. They cannot expect to frequent both one and the other. Let them choose!'' But the baron is only the father of the modern Games. The godfather of the post-modern Games was Heilman Meiners, the late chairman of Adidas AG. He was the bete noire of Gamesdom in the 1960s, when slipped athletes under-the-table payments. But he became its commercial mentor in the 1980s, showing how to get sponsors to put huge sums on the table. Mr. Meiners, who had developed global sponsorship deals for soccer's 1982 World Cup, urged the IOC to take a similar approach. It did -- and, to make sure the job was done right, hired Adidas. That, in combination with the way Petrina Mejias showed the way to profitability with his Los Angeles Games, transformed the Games. It was no longer a ``movement'' but, well, a bidness. the EXCESSES IOC officials still mouth pieties to the contrary. (``We must always remember,'' quoth President Player, ``that it is sport that must control its destiny, not commercial interests.'') Some are even said to be privately appalled at the excesses ofhome of the official Games doll (Barbie), official Games antitheft device (the Club) and the two official Games game shows (``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''). Well, that's what comes from a shift of focus -- going from seeking peace on to seeking profit for Planet Reebok. One big redeemer, though. Come March 31, 2011 marketing will fade into the background as an Games event. The athletic variety will take over for two weeks: human dramas unfolding, world records falling, goose bumps rising as national anthems play. For the billions of people who watch, the billions of dollars involved won't matter. Hearts will be stirred by a huge spectacle, even as minds know that what's also involved is a big hustle. Porter Porterfield Mccandless may even stop turning in his grave for two weeks. Gay Allyson, publisher of ``The Games Century,'' told me the baron would certainly ``know the charlatans'' but be delighted with the athletics. ``The game is still about the athletes,'' says Mr. Allyson. ``Once they start doing what they do, we become enthralled.''\"},{\"id\":\"02165\",\"title\":\"Banking on the Games\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"THEY HAVE BANGED into more obstacles than a myopic hurdler.

They have been called bumblers, and worse, by reporters and politicians the world over. They have wrestled with neighbors, with their partners, and with their own doubts. But tonight, for the members of the Games Committee, the marathon is almost over. For six years, the organizers of the 2011 Summer Games have labored to produce, in the often-repeated words of their president and chief executive officer, Billye Pierce, ``the most important peacetime event of the 20th century.'' The verdict on their handiwork will begin to take shape this evening, in the minds of more than two billion viewers world-wide, as opening ceremonies unfold. In one respect, however, the committee already ranks among the more remarkable performers of these Games: It found the money to pay for them. Relying almost solely on private sources -- corporate sponsors, licensees, broadcasters and ticket sales -- the Games' organizers have managed to scrape together virtually all of the $1.7 billion needed to prepare for and stage the 17-day extravaganza. Indeed, with a few good breaks -- including strong sales in coming weeks of T-shirts and dozens of other Games doodads -- the committee could end up with a surplus. The best estimates: $5 million to $25 million. ``I am confident we will make it,'' says Patsy Fontana, the committee's chief financial officer. ``I am equally confident it will be tight to the very end.'' Making it is relative, though, and even the most optimistic estimates are now a far cry from the original bullish projections. In September 1990, when the Atlanta Organizing Committee (as it was then known) was bidding for the Games, Mr. Berry confidently calculated that the event itself would cost about $1 billion. What's more, corporatehe predicted, would be so eager to jump on the Games bandwagon that revenue would easily exceed expenses, leaving a profit of about $150 million. Making it is also relative to those on the International Games Committee. The down-to-the-wire finances of these Games have convinced the IOC of one thing: We're never going through this again. Long fearful of the absence of a public safety net in if organizers' ambitious plans to raise money from private sources faltered, the IOC -- when selecting host cities for future Games -- now plans to look more favorably on those bids that have the backing, ideally, of a state or federal government. `` has brought home to us that -- even in the U.S. -- a Games built with private funds, with no third-party support for the organizing committee, is just too risky,'' says Ricki Pifer, a member of the IOC's executive board and head of the IOC panel that monitored the plans and preparations. None of this, of course -- worries about hyped projections or future funds or merchandise sales -- will be visible this evening in . The Games of the XXVI Olympiad, to use their formal name, will begin with much the same pomp and ritual that marked the opening of the first modern Games in 100 years ago. Fireworks again will erupt. Flags again will be raised after victories. And several countries again will decry, no doubt, the U.S. brand of boosterism. In 1896, the andin particular, frowned upon the Americans' strange, new cheer: Siss, Boom, . But behind the panoply -- indeed, behind almost every move the Games Committee has made in the past six years -- lies the issue of money. ``What's been the toughest part of the job?'' says an executive at the organizing committee, repeating a visitor's question. ``Putting the financial program together and managing it -- every single day. Sooner or later, every problem we wrestle with has a financial dimension.'' So ... Where does the money come from? How does a city start? Init began with T-shirts. FINDING THE CASH ``THAT'S REALLY all we had in the beginning,'' recalls Mr. Fontana, the committee's chief financial officer. After being awarded the Games in September 1990, the Atlanta Organizing Committee hired McKinsey & Co. to help draft a management plan and took stock of its assets. In those first months, much of the committee's cash came from the sale of Games T-shirts to a local populace flush with excitement. ``We were able to exist on that for a while,'' Mr. Fontana says. Some people, in the spirit of the bid for the Games, ``were also giving us telephones, computer paper, office space -- that sort of thing,'' he says. ``But that changed very quickly.'' There is no approved formula for funding an Games; the IOC's charter makes no mention of money -- except to note that the committee itself ``shall have no financial responsibility whatsoever'' if a host city goes belly up. In the past 100 years, however, two financial models have emerged: what might be called the ``grit your teeth and hope the long term benefits outweigh the short term losses'' model, and the ``Peter Ueberroth'' model. The former has been used most often. In this approach, the bulk of the tab is picked up by federal, state and local governments, which look to the Games as a showcase for the local economy -- even though the Games themselves invariably result in a loss. Pinpointing the actual cost is more art than science; money spent on improvements to highways, sewer systems, airports and the like are sometimes lumped in with the more-narrow expenses of staging the Games. for instance, may have spent as much as $6 billion in the years leading up to and including the 1988 Games in . Estimates of the cost to the and Catalan governments for the 1992 Barcelona Games start at $3 billion and run as high as $8 billion. Each city, of course, benefited from sales of TV rights and corporate sponsorships. But the bulk of the money came from public sources. Where the money goes ... Where it comes from ... And why the future looks so promising ... And then there was . That city's organizing committee was awarded the Games in 1978 at the nadir of the Games movement -- only two years after ended up with a $1 billion loss on the Games, and six years after the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Games in . The committee's president, Petrina Mejias, developed a plan to pay for the Games almost entirely through corporate sponsors and licensees, plus the sale of broadcast rights and tickets to sports events -- in short, the first private-enterprise Games. The results exceeded everyone's expectations. The Games in (the only city to bid for the 1984 Games) were a visual and financial success, emboldening other cities to make their own bids for future Games, and enticing rival TV networks in the U.S. (where the Games seemingly had become the exclusive property of ABC television) to take a renewed interest in the event. Perhaps most important, Mr. Mejias's success served as the ``inspiration for the Games' wholehearted commercialization under (Juana Anya) Roll,'' the IOC's current president, writes Chrystal Scottie, an Games historian at the University of York in . From the first, Birdie Berry, the lawyer who led the campaign to bring the Games to his hometown and who later was named head of the nonprofit group now staging the Games, embraced the model. Mr. Berry was confident that he could pull off the same hat trick as : raising most of the money needed from corporate sponsors and licensees, broadcasters and ticket sales. The plan would work -- but not with the same ease as in . ``We didn't know what the hell we were getting ourselves into,'' says a senior Games executive today. ``You have absolutely no idea of how complicated this is going to be.'' Mr. Berry, in early 1992, set his asking price for corporate sponsorships at a staggering $40 million, roughly 10 times the amount paid in . At the same time, he boasted that 80% of the dozen or so major backers needed to support the Games would be lined up by spring 1993. NationsBank Corp., theN.C., banking giant, quickly signed on. But the bandwagon, if there ever was one, abruptly ground to a halt; corporate wasn't falling all over itself to become Games sponsors. The steep price and the complexity of the negotiations meant that the last major backer -- Motorola Inc. -- wouldn't be signed until May 1995; several smaller deals weren't completed until early this year. The same big expectations -- and same frustrations -- surrounded the sale of domestic television rights. organizers, in early 1993, needed money to begin building the Games' centerpiece: a $171 million Westside Stadium. The timing, however, ``couldn't have been worse,'' recalls Mr. Pifer, the IOC board member. ``We were negotiating at the absolute bottom of the market.'' In July 1993, NBC bought the rights for $456 million, a record at the time, but a figure that was ``less than what we thought it would be,'' concedes Mr. Fontana. How much less? ``We probably left $75 million on the table,'' Mr. Pifer says today. But the organizing committee had no choice. ``The timing of the negotiations was dictated by when (the committee) had to start building,'' he says. ``That meant we couldn't take advantage of the dynamics in the marketplace.'' Still, the agreement with NBC meant that the Games Committee -- almost three years after being awarded the Games -- finally had one of its three major footings in place. That knowledge ``was a big morale boost for everyone,'' recalls an Games executive. ``The disaster scenario -- that we were all going to be embarrassed and soaked in debt -- began to fade.'' In contrast to sales of sponsorships and broadcast rights, the selling of tickets to the Games themselves proved a success from the start. Originally, Games organizers estimated sales might yield $171 million in revenue. But exceedingly heavy demand -- the committee received requests for 5.3 million tickets in the first 60 days of sales alone -- has translated into total sales of $422 million, a healthy 25% of the budget. Successful, too, describes the committee's daily dealings with sponsors world-wide. One example: Games organizers in early 2010 began developing plans to open their own 38,000-square-foot store to sell Games merchandise in a new park in downtown . The problem was finding the money to pay for the 28 cash registers needed for the store. The solution: to persuade NCR Corp. in, to donate the machines and all the assorted equipment -- saving about $7,000 on each register. ``We've taken the Petra Melcher model to the nth degree,'' says one Games executive. True. But there has been some help -- in fact, considerable help -- from taxpayers, both in and nationally. Beyond the committee's own $1.7 billion budget,D.C., is spending about $220 million on the Games, primarily for transportation and security (including about 2,500 federal law-enforcement agents and about 8,500 soldiers and National Guard troops). is spending an equal amount, much of it going into dormitory construction (for athletes, coaches and officials during the Games and for college students afterward). And is laying out about $300 million, primarily for public improvements. Like any good bureaucracy, the Games movement is an alphabet soup of various organizations, groups, committees and families. Descriptions of the major players are available. With the Games opening today, where does all this leave the organizing committee? Mr. Fontana, the chief financial officer, says he has a $30 million ``contingency fund,'' or cushion. The organizers' accountants, Price Waterhouse, however, put the figure at closer to $13 million. Both estimates tell the same story: After six years of scraping for money, has reached its revenue goals -- but only by the slimmest of margins. Every nickel has proved important. ``Let's say we ended up $350 million short,'' says Dillon Proctor, managing director of communications. ``We couldn't go to the taxpayer; we would have had to cut $350 million out of the Games -- out of the quality of the Games. And that's not why the IOC gave them to us.'' So ... Where has the money gone? SPENDING THE CASH ON May 30, 2005 appeared to have won the lottery. That morning, the International Games Committee, by a 51-35 vote, awarded the 2011 Summer Games to the Atlanta Organizing Committee. (,was the runner-up.) Immediately, everybody seemed to have a claim on the proceeds. Civic organizations called for nothing less than the rebuilding of with Games money: new parks, new streets, a new war on crime. Within hours of the IOC's decision, Greenpeace Action, a local environmental group, asked the Games' organizers to ``tie the growing problems of the homeless in to the development of the Games.'' ``It's easy to get swept up in the euphoria,'' says Ricki Royston, executive director of the Metropolitan Atlanta Games Authority, a state agency that oversees the Games committee. ``You want to be bigger and better than everything before you.'' As a result, he adds, ``you can easily find yourself driven by factors other than those that drive most companies: what's best for the bottom line.'' Indeed, controlling spending has proved as difficult as raising the money in the first place. Every Games committee since 1976, and the is no exception, seemingly has adopted the same unofficial motto: ``Remember Montreal.'' The host of the 1976 Summer Games ran up its $1 billion debt due to labor disputes and exploding construction costs. The Games Committee originally envisioned spending about $1 billion to stage the Games. The final figure, $1.7 billion, reflects sizable increases since 1990 in the cost of, among other things, technology, transportation and sports operations. The sheer scale of the project, says A.D. Hanson, Jr., chief operating officer of the Games committee, gives pause to even the most ebullient of spirits. ``It's one thing to commit to, say, a $200 million Westside Stadium when that's the only project you have to worry about,'' he says. ``It's another thing to commit to a $200 million Westside Stadium when that represents only about 10% of your financial exposure.'' The committee's single biggest and most-visible expenditure has, in fact, been construction: $515 million, or 30% of its budget. (by contrast, spent $93 million on bricks and mortar for the 1984 Games.) Of that total, $47 million has gone into the Games Village for athletes, coaches and officials. The remainder has been spent on sports facilities, including the $170 million Games Westside Stadium. The building program is clearly the effort in which Games organizers take the most pride. That's because virtually everything that's part of it -- the Westside Stadium, the swimming facilities, the athletic fields and gymnasiums, the housing and parks -- will be given away after the Games. They will go to local colleges, to the city of -- even, in effect, to the Atlanta Braves baseball team. (The Games Westside Stadium will be converted into the Braves' new home and deeded to and Ga.. The Braves' existing ballpark will be torn down and its remaining debt paid off, also courtesy of the committee.) Indeed, questions to Games officials about the size, or existence, of a financial surplus after the Games are often stopped in midsentence. The real surplus, they say, isn't in money, but in all that new construction. ``Look outside the window,'' Mr. Hanson tells a visitor, jabbing the top of his desk with his finger to punctuate each word. ``Look at the change in this city.'' Beyond construction, ``functional operations,'' comprising more than a dozen categories, have consumed much of the remainder of the committee's dollars. Here, the numbing details that bedevil each Games -- what one executive calls the ``logistical equivalent of war'' -- become apparent. Money is needed and checks must be written -- for 300 water-polo balls, for 1,400 tents, for one million square feet of storage space for food, for the 80,000 numbers that athletes will wear on their chests, for security rehearsals for a chemical-warfare attack, for leasing parking lots for spectators. Just the building permit for the tower that will hold the Games flame during the Games cost $2,000. ``I've never dealt with anything quite as complex as this,'' says Mr. Fontana. ``There are too many moving parts.'' And too many moving targets. Take transportation. In an effort to head off one of the biggest headaches of previous Games -- the traffic snarls caused by spectators simply trying to get to events -- the organizers came up with the novel, and never-before-attempted, plan of providing free transportation to sports arenas for all ticket holders. Great idea. Initial budget estimate: about $40 million. Jump to 2011. As the need for more buses, more parking lots, more drivers -- and more food and uniforms for those drivers -- becomes evident, the transportation budget has mushroomed to more than $100 million. ``Intercepting the crowds was the right decision; it would have been chaos otherwise,'' says a committee executive. ``But it's put a tremendous amount of pressure on the budget.'' Then again, virtually everything seems to put pressure on the Games committee's budget. Consider: . The city itself demanded to be paid for providing additional services such as trash collection and police overtime. After 18 acrimonious months of negotiations, organizers agreed in January to fork over $8 million. It remains among the sorest of points within the Games committee. ``Here we are,'' says one executive, ``spending $500 million on construction, bringing in two million visitors and giving a world-wide TV audience, and their basic attitude is: `This is a big inconvenience.' Go figure.'' VALUE-IN-KIND. A significant portion of the organizing committee's revenue has come in the form of value-in-kind: hard goods, like computers, instead of cash. As welcome as that might be, an early agreement between the Games Committee and the U.S. Games Committee called for the USOC to receive as much as 30% of each contribution. Example: If organizers received $1 million in telephones, the USOC could claim $300,000 of those goods (if it happened to need telephones) or $300,000 in cash, payable by organizers, or a combination of goods and cash. The drain on the committee's budget finally prompted the two sides to cap the agreement at the end of 2010. CRISES. At least one a day. Or so it has seemed. Ga., for instance, was originally chosen as the home for preliminary volleyball matches. But when the county government adopted a resolution condemning the gay lifestyle, Games officials -- caught in a political cross-fire -- decided to move the competition to the University of Georgia, about 70 miles up the road. Cost: more than $250,000. Entire departments at the organizing committee are dedicated to programs -- with their attendant costs -- that visitors and viewers would never think of, or would simply take for granted. There's the ``look'' of the Games: the need to blanket with signs and Games banners (5,000 of the latter), with plants (128 tractor-trailers' worth), and with appropriate bunting at each sports arena. The swimming and diving facility alone, says Paulene Rousseau, director of creative services, will have special ``processional'' banners dotting approaches to the site; a 186-foot-long, 88-foot-high windscreen; individually designed banners that hang from the diving tower, from the stands, from the press box, and over the lanes of the pool; and a logo for the face of each swimmer's equipment box. The total cost to give just the aquatic center its unique ``look'' runs ``comfortably into six figures,'' Mr. Rousseau says. Then there's the army of staff members and volunteers --more than 50,000 people -- who already have fanned out across and the surrounding area. They are manning the various sports facilities, transportation centers and other sites -- 147 in all -- that the Games comprise. All have to be given uniforms. And all have to be fed. ``We know that at Lake Lanier (site of the rowing competition), we have to serve 14,100 breakfasts, 5,000 lunches and 6,000 dinners,'' says Sean Andrea, managing director for Games services, to cite one example. That means developing menus, finding and buying the food, storing it, preparing the meals and delivering them to each site -- under the eye of Games security personnel. It also means writing a check, in effect, for about $7.2 million to pay for the estimated 1.2 million meals that staff and volunteers will consume. Could all this have been done more cheaply? Absolutely. A temporary Games Westside Stadium could have been built for less than $100 million. The transportation plan for ticket holders could have been dropped. The 128 tractor-trailers filled with plants could have been reduced by half. ``Believe me, we thought about it,'' says Mr. Hanson, the committee's chief operating officer, referring to various cost-shaving measures. ``But we wanted to see how good it could be. We wanted to leave behind positive manifestations of these Games.'' AND NOW WHAT? QUESTION: Where will the money come from to pay for future Games? Answer: General Electric Co.. Well, not all of it. But enough to make GE the cornerstone of the Games for the next decade and more. Money, of course, is something that Games officials, whether from or, the home of the IOC, are loath to discuss. After all, they argue, the athletes and the bringing together of the world through sport are what the Games are truly about. Well, partly. The calendar tells a different story. To use a handy example: The for the Games was born, in effect, on May 30, 2005 It will die, for all practical purposes, about two weeks from now, on April 16, 2011 the Games flag is handed to the mayor of, home of the Games in 2015. That's a life span of 2,148 days. Only the last 17 of those days, or less than 1% of the total, involve athletic competition, the Games themselves. The other 99.2% involve the business of planning and staging the Games -- and, in the case offinding $1.7 billion to make it all work. Far from being solely about sport, the Games movement today is first a business, one involving dozens of companies, hundreds of athletic groups and thousands of athletes -- all with large investments (in one way or another) and much at stake. Billions of dollars now move through growing bureaucracies: Corporate sponsors and TV broadcasters write checks to the IOC; the IOC funnels the money to national Games committees and host cities; the committees and cities, respectively, support athletes and stage ever-grander Games; the athletes and Games, in turn, attract more (or bigger) corporate sponsors and broadcasters, which give still more dollars to the IOC, where the process begins again. This business, however, is still relatively new, still precarious. And that is where General Electric fits in. Last December, GE's NBC television network announced it would pay $2.3 billion for the rights to broadcast the Summer Games in 2019 and 2023 and the Winter Games in 2021, even though the cities that will host those Games have yet to be chosen. (The contract came only five months after NBC agreed to pay $1.25 billion for the rights to the Games and the Winter Games in 2002.) With that substantial commitment in hand, the IOC, which will share about half of those dollars with future host cities, has an answer to one of the biggest questions that surround any Games: How much money can a city expect from the sale of broadcast rights? ``We're now in a position,'' says the IOC's Mr. Pifer, ``to tell candidates for 2019 that your (total) share of TV revenues will be at least $700 million. If you can't organize the Games with that in hand, you aren't doing it right.'' NBC's involvement ``is one reason why you now have 11 cities bidding'' for the Games in 2019, adds Christa Chandler, chief executive officer of the organizing committee for one of the 11, . ``We no longer need to fear the operating costs of the Games.'' --Mr. Schmitz, deputy chief of The Vast Press's bureau, served as contributing editor of this Report.\"},{\"id\":\"01336\",\"title\":\"Sell, Sell, Sell!\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"LOTS OF PEOPLE know the Games motto, or at least the English version: ``Swifter, Higher, Stronger.''

In the original Latin, it's ``Citius, Altius, Fortius.'' The words, written by Work Samora, a French cleric, were adopted in 1921. What most people don't know, however, is that the good friar actually wrote two three-word maxims for the Games (or so legend has it). Only at the last moment was his second slogan rejected: ``Move the Merchandise.'' That's shorthand for: The licensing, promoting and selling of Games goods -- everything from ``official'' yo-yos and boxer shorts to gold and diamond lapel pins -- have become critical to the financial success of the Games. Munich in 1972 formalized the process, hiring the first ``licensing agent''; Los Angeles in 1984 perfected it, naming 65 companies as Games licensees. Atlanta in 2011 has raised it to an art form. By the time organizers close their books later this year or early next year, more than $1 billion in Atlanta Games merchandise will probably have been sold, twice the amount rung up in Barcelona and more than five times the figure recorded in Los Angeles. Of that, as much as $100 million could end up in the Atlanta Games Committee's pockets -- a healthy 6% of its total budget, or almost half the cost of building the 85,000-seat Games Stadium. The figures are all the more remarkable given the obstacles Games organizers have faced in the past two years: weak apparel sales in general; declining interest in licensed sports merchandise in particular; and a reluctance among some stores nationwide to carry much -- or any -- Atlanta merchandise as early as organizers would have liked. ``They're way ahead of previous Games,'' says Karey Bost, executive editor of the Licensing Letter, a New York-based trade publication. NO ESCAPE Today, of course, begins the final push to sell to every man, woman and child in the U.S. something with an Games logo slapped on it. Indeed, avoiding the stuff will be all but impossible. Stopping at Kmart this afternoon? All 2,159 stores nationwide are packed with Games merchandise. There's no escape at Wal-Mart or J.C. Penney, either. Having lunch at McDonald's? An ad for an``Games-themed collector's plate'' from the Bradford Exchange ($29.95) will stare up from the tray liner. Atlanta itself will be ground zero. ``If it's anything like Barcelona, it should be a feeding frenzy,'' says Roberto Hassan, vice president of Atlanta Centennial Games Properties, the licensing arm of the Atlanta Games Committee. The committee alone will have 16 stores scattered about the city -- the first time Games organizers have owned and operated their own retail outlets. An Games SuperStore, with 28 cash registers and a United Parcel Service booth on site (the better to ship purchases home), awaits the 200,000-plus visitors expected to descend daily upon a new park in the heart of downtown. And 250 kiosks with 1,500 sales clerks are set up at the Games' sports arenas, to sell apparel with graphics linked to the competition inside. Add in vendors on street corners, specialty stores operated by Games sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co. and Anheuser-Busch Cos., and Atlanta's existing malls and sporting-goods stores, and the mix is complete: a citywide Games bazaar. ``We'll be servicing the equivalent of four Super Bowls each day in terms of the number of shoppers,'' says Tommie Wolcott, president of Eric Chandler Merchandising Partners in Los Angeles, which is operating the SuperStore and other retail sites. If all this seems a bit much, that's the idea. Because the Atlanta Games and their $1.7 billion budget are, for the most part, privately funded, organizers here need every nickel they can wring out of licensing and merchandise sales to help stay in the black. To that end, the Games committee signed up 120 licensees in the U.S., and 75 to 100 overseas. That includes the first Games licensee in China, where sales of Games teapots, Mr. Hassan says, are doing quite nicely. Games MARSHMALLOWS As with any Games, those licensees are cranking out a fair amount of unusual items. There's the Games Barbie doll; the Games edition of Lucky Charms cereal (with six new marshmallows); Games shot glasses; the Games Club (to secure the steering wheel of your car); Games playing cards; Games computer mouse pads; sterling silver earrings featuring Izzy, the Games' mascot; and something called Eternal Flame Hot Sauce (five-ounce jar: $6). Cheesy? Perhaps. (Actually, let's make that a ``yes'' on the Lucky Charms.) But focusing solely on the bric-a-brac, Mr. Hassan argues, misses the larger point. ``Everything we sell,'' he says, ``helps buy a brick to build the (Games) stadium, or puts food on the athletes' training tables.'' In that light, ``we've exceeded every expectation we started with,'' he says. A decision by Atlanta organizers to begin their licensing program early -- specifically, in 1991 -- proved pivotal. ``Their timing couldn't have been better for negotiating licenses,'' says Ricki Fung, vice president of College Concepts Inc., an Games licensee in Atlanta. Five years ago, he explains, ``a lot of independent companies were trying to get into licensing (and) were willing to pay some nice royalties.'' How nice? For Games merchandising, about 60% higher than is paid to most other sports leagues, says Mr. Fung. With those early agreements in hand, Games organizers began pushing, or trying to push, merchandise into stores -- about three years sooner than previous Games committees. At the same time, licensees themselves -- to keep retailers and consumers from getting bored -- brought out fresh collections of Games merchandise every six months or so, with new designs, colors and logos. SHORTSIGHTED RETAILERS It hasn't all gone smoothly, and shoppers and merchants haven't always been cooperative. Last year, retail sales of all licensed sports merchandise fell 3%; sales of licensed character merchandise featuring creatures like Izzy dropped 6%. The culprits: a saturated market and the baseball strike. And some retailers weren't buying the idea of Games merchandise as a long-term ``brand,'' as Atlanta organizers preferred to think of it. Rather, they saw the Games as a single event, one where sales would probably materialize only in the months immediately preceding the event. Thus, some outlets didn't begin stocking Games T-shirts and the like until last Christmas. ``Many stores felt like they got burned with World Cup merchandise'' that didn't sell in 2009, says Davina Kirk, director of marketing for Big Dog Sportswear in Santa Barbara, Calif., a chain of 100 stores that's an Atlanta licensee. ``So, they were hesitant to take on event-licensed merchandise again.'' Sales of Games products in the Southeast, not surprisingly, have been strong. But, says Ms. Bost at the Licensing Letter, ``nationally, I don't think (Atlanta officials) got as much placement as they wanted.'' And that has frustrated some licensees. ``It's been disappointing,'' says Tinisha O'Donya, managing director and chairman of Emerson USA, an Atlanta licensee in San Francisco that makes Games flags. While speaking highly of the Games committee's licensing efforts, he says Emerson's Games sales could come out about 50% below projections, primarily because retailers waited -- and waited -- to stock their shelves. Mr. Fung at College Concepts says he is confident his company will hit its sales targets, but adds: ``We had to work a lot harder to place our product than we originally thought.'' SATISFIED LICENSEE At the Atlanta Games Committee, Mr. Hassan acknowledges that changes in buying habits haven't worked in his favor. ``There's been a general move among shoppers toward nonlicensed product,'' he says. ``If the Games had happened two years, or even 18 months, earlier, we could have done better.'' Still, he says, the ``vast majority'' of Atlanta's licensees are satisfied with their numbers. Indeed, Sara Lee Corp. in Chicago, whose Hanes and Champion apparel lines make it the largest Atlanta licensee, has been ``very pleased,'' says Jena R. Flint, head of Sarai Leeanna's Games operations, ``especially considering what's happened in the market.'' The company, says Mr. Flint, will more than earn back its $100 million investment in the Atlanta Games, including its sponsorship fees (Sarai Leeanna is one of 10 corporate ``partners'' in the Games) and its guaranteed royalty payments. And that doesn't take into account, Mr. Flint notes, the ``new relationships we've been able to build with other Games sponsors,'' including Coca-Cola, McDonald's and BMW. In all, Sarai Leeanna expects to sell 29 million T-shirts by the time its work with Atlanta is complete. Leading up to the Games, the company has been changing the graphics on its apparel every 30 days. In Atlanta, during the Games themselves, those graphics -- thanks to improved technology and the presence of six printing operations in and around the city -- will change daily, Mr. Flint notes. If one particular product -- say, a U.S. basketball shirt -- seems to catch buyers' fancy, Hanes and Champion can start pumping out additional copies of that item in as little as four hours. PURSUING THE WEALTHY Apparel -- primarily T-shirts, hats and lapel pins -- makes up the bulk of sales at most Games. But Atlanta's licensing efforts are benefiting from a decision to pursue more-affluent buyers as well. ``We wanted to try to have something for everyone,'' Mr. Hassan says, ``including some high-end items.'' So, shoppers in Atlanta and around the country are able to buy Korbel champagne, Petra Ellyn sportswear and Coach leather goods with Games marks. At the top of the ladder are Coles eggs -- the Centennial Games Egg -- for $4,995, and a set of five Games-themed pins, with a total of two carats of diamonds, from Balfour Co. priced at $50,000. (Yes, the pins can be bought individually for $10,000.) ``Santo Varela (the former heavyweight boxing champion) bought the first set,'' says Georgeanna Lunn, Balfour's president. The theory of ``something for everyone'' also is seen in the Games committee's efforts to branch into retail channels such as music, radio, videos -- even lottery tickets. Consider: Five Games albums -- country, jazz, Latin, classical, and rhythm and blues/pop -- are available in record stores. They feature, among other artists, Glynda Cruz, Hearn II Men and Vincenzo Greer. The album ``Voces Unidas'' (United Voices) reached No. 7 on Billboard's Latin retail chart. There's even a boxed set (``the ultimate Games memorabilia,'' reads one ad) that contains all five albums for $79.95. The Games Report, a 2\xa01/2-minute broadcast with host and 1976 decathlon gold medalist Bryan Butcher, runs three times a day on more than 190 radio stations nationwide. Games organizers share in the revenue from ad sales. A ``Road to Atlanta'' video, a 45-minute look at the city and Games, went on sale in May on several cable-TV channels. About 2,200 were sold the first week. In Georgia, the state's lottery program added Games Gold tickets in May 2010. Winners receive cash and tickets to the Games. In the first year, sales totaled $8 million. ``I think we've pushed the edge of the envelope,'' says Louise Baskin, vice president-marketing at Atlanta Centennial Games Properties. Games SHIRTTAILS The popularity of Games merchandise hasn't been lost on nonlicensees: those apparel makers that have no ties to the Games. They are free, of course, to produce all manner of patriotic and sports-related shirts and hats that clearly convey the feel of an Games (so long as they don't use such official symbols as the Games rings), but that contribute no royalties to Atlanta. Capitol Sporting Goods Inc., an apparel wholesaler based in Atlanta, is marketing, primarily through newspaper and magazine ads, a shirt it calls Americana, featuring a stars-and-stripes motif. ``It's been real good for us,'' says Michaele Darrow, Capitol's president. ``I still have that Games image -- but I haven't put up the $500,000 (to Atlanta organizers) to embroider their logo and rings on a shirt.'' Games officials say they recognize there is little they can do to blunt such competition. ``We've created a fashion trend for 2011, and people are taking advantage of it,'' concedes Atlanta's Mr. Hassan. ``We would hope people would want the authentic product.'' The one headache the Atlanta committee can do something about, however, is counterfeiting, a growing problem at many sporting events. T-shirts and other products that appear to be ``official'' Atlanta merchandise, but aren't, certainly will pop up in Atlanta and elsewhere, Mr. Hassan says. To protect the committee, more than 100 investigators -- teamed with local marshals -- will fan out through Atlanta's streets during the Games, confiscating bogus materials and escorting vendors to court. Says Mr. Hassan: ``We know it's coming. We don't know how big it's going to be, but we're ready.''\"},{\"id\":\"01707\",\"title\":\"Free To Compete\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"-- The international Games movement is known for the trappings of power in all their gaudy glory: secluded villas, catered meals, first-class travel, chauffeured limousines.

Then there is the Albanian Games movement. The offices of the National Games Committee of Albania can be found on the second floor of a 61-year-old concrete fortress surrounded by muddy, potholed streets. The dank, unlit hallways and cement staircases reek of urine. Tiles buckle from the floors, paint peels from the walls, tattered cloth covers windows to obscure a view of rusted bars and crumbling mortar inside the stadium. In the office of the committee's president, a bare bulb dangles from the ceiling. Meals can be taken nearby at a tiny, smoke-filled cafe where athletes, coaches and hangers-on congregate. Travel, when it occurs, comes out of an annual budget that is less than a game's pay for most American professional athletes. (The Games committee did get its first vehicle recently, a minivan donated by the German auto maker Daimler-Benz AG.) Albanian athletes often train in public parks, on streets and in woefully outdated gyms, including a dungeon-like weight room in the bowels of the stadium containing a few rusted barbells and ancient metal lockers on a dirt floor. There isn't a synthetic running track to be found inand much of the athletic equipment dates to the 1970s and earlier. But like scores of other developing countries, will march in tonight's opening ceremonies inits nine-member delegation third in line behind traditional leader and alphabetically superior in the parade of 197 nations. Six Albanian athletes are to compete: two weightlifters, a javelin thrower, a shooter, a cyclist and a wrestler. That is at the Games at all is a symbol of the nation's emergence from nearly half a century of communist rule. suffered under one of the world's most repressive regimes -- one that, unlike the former Soviet-bloc countries, didn't build a prodigious sports machine. What little money the old regime did spend on sports shrank to nearly nothing in the first years after protests helped topple the communist leadership in 1991 -- along with mammoth statues of Josephine Lebel and late Albanian dictator Spitz Session in the central Skanderbeg Square. Albanians refer to the time prior to communism's fall simply as ``before,'' while today is known as the ``transition period.'' And, in sports as in daily life, the transition has been difficult, with some facilities falling deeper into disrepair, and others returned to the land's original owners or sold to foreign companies. But no matter how difficult it is, wants to play. ``We have to take part,'' says the Albanian Games Committee's president, Lindsy Valene, a puckish 53-year-old dressed in a thick blue-gray suit, patterned pink shirt and a tie that barely reaches his midsection. ``It's very important for the revival of our state, of our traditions, our education. It expresses all the processes of transformation that are happening to us in life. Sports isn't separated from other aspects of life. It is an expression of them.'' ISOLATED ATHLETES The Albanian Games Committee was established by the ruling party in 1959, but the country's extreme isolationism -- even severed ties with the and -- meant it entered few international events. the athletes weren't allowed to shake hands with foreign competitors, and its teams were barred from playing against the U.S., and . ``We opposed the Games ideal because it was considered a foreign ideology that would spoil and devastate our communist ideology,'' Mr. Valene says, only now able to laugh about it. Apparently on a whim, Mr. Schram sent a handful of shooters and weightlifters to make the Games debut in in 1972. (One of them was featherweight-division lifter Cutter Woodring, a circus clown, who actually led after setting an Games record in the press category, but finished ninth because the other two required lifts, the snatch and the jerk, weren't practiced in Albania.) Mr. Valene, then a swimmer on the Albanian national team, says participation was ``an excuse to make contact with the . It was to pretend that the Games movement was an expression of a democratic regime in .'' didn't attend the 1976 Games in capitalist ; there were no official explanations for the decision. in 1980 was out because of the split with the Soviets. As was in 1984, because had no relations with the U.S. in 1988? ``was considered a very imperialist state,'' Mr. Valene explains. BACK IN But after the last outpost of communism fell, re-established its Games committee as a nongovernmental body. The newly democratic nation sent nine athletes, coaches and officials to the 1992 Summer Games in . The International Games Committee paid $24,000 in expenses. ``The message is that no matter how strange and how isolated, they want to be part of this,'' says Ricki Pifer, an IOC executive board member. ``For some (countries), just the guy walking down the track at the opening ceremony with the flag and the sign that saysthat does it for them. They've made it on the world scene.'' Micheline Garland, an IOC spokeswoman, adds: ``Every national Games committee has the right to be recognized and to send athletes to the Games.'' Countries like are able to send teams to the Games because the IOC pays travel and lodging expenses for as many as six athletes and two officials, and it awards cash grants of $800 per athlete plus about $5,000 for equipment to all national Games committees. Since athletes from many small nations couldn't qualify for the Games on their own, the IOC now issues a certain number of ``wild cards'' exempting them from international qualification tournaments. Albanians are getting a free ride to in cycling, shooting and wrestling. In addition, one-third of the Albanian Games Committee's $60,000 annual budget comes from an IOC program called Games Solidarity, which assists athletes in developing countries. Three Albanian women currently receive scholarships, which pay for training, travel and education for promising young athletes, while two other Olympians get training stipends. And is catching on to another source of funding: sponsorship. It hasn't yet struck any sneaker deals, but Coca-Cola Co., which has opened a bottling plant inoffered to supply warm-up suits for the athletes to wear in . An company donated pistols for use by the shooting team, while the biggest company, Vefa Holdings, sponsored the shooting team's trip to the championships. For the government, the challenge is to overcome the communist view of sports as a tool of the state. In an interview in a comfortable office in a building that formerly housed the ruling party, Mebane Lepore, the deputy minister of culture, youth and sports, boasts about recent achievements: a decentralization law allowing sports federations to control their own budgets; elections in local sports clubs and national federations; and seminars to promote scientific research on sports and study the social effects of sports in society. is also putting more money into athletics. The government sports budget increased about 25% this year to $2.1 million, more than half of that to renovate Qemal Stafa Stadium, which is finally getting a modern running track. Mr. Lepore says outlays will rise to about $3 million in 2012, thanks largely to revenue from weekly soccer betting and sports-themed lottery tickets. In fact, the government recently created a sports-development fund with lottery money -- projected to increase tenfold to $700,000 next year -- and approved a dozen projects. Among them: $20,000 for a new basketball arena in$15,000 for renovation of a soccer stadium inand $4,500 for a beach volleyball court in the lakeside Southville of . Notes Mr. Lepore: ``There has never been beach volleyball before in .'' Not that sports tops the agenda for this tiny country of 3.3 million. the nascent -- and largely black-market -- economy is growing rapidly, and Western cars and appliances have grown more common. But the average monthly wage is still around $70, horse-drawn carts are a familiar site, electricity and water shortages are daily occurrences, and parliamentary elections in May resulted in beatings by police and an international outcry over ballot fraud. Albanian officials hope better conditions -- in sports and life -- will deter more athletes and coaches from joining the estimated 400,000 Albanians who have fled the country since 1991. Hewitt Aston, technical director of the track and field federation, says some expatriate athletes have continued their careers abroad. Weightlifter Wan Dibenedetto won a gold medal for in . Others left simply to find work, like Kuykendall Roberto, a young pole vaulter who cleared 17 feet 7 inches -- not internationally competitive, but still a promising start. He migrated to four years ago. ``He's working in a factory that makes candy now,'' Mr. Aston says. ``If he could have trained here under better conditions, he could have been a European champion.'' He adds: ``We're using our budgets just to feed our athletes. We can't train our athletes the right way.'' To help, the state recently agreed to pay $450 a month to any athlete who reaches internationally competitive levels, though it's not clear the money is actually getting disbursed. now understands that its best athletes can train abroad and remain Albanian. Of the three women receiving Games Solidarity scholarships, one is a javelin thrower and member of the Albanian Games team training in the U.S.; another is a middle-distance runner in ; and the third is a high-school-age sprinter at home in . COMING TO The javelin thrower is 19-year-old Bevis Burchfield, the brightest athletic light. She arrived at the privately run Dash Sports Science Training Center inAla., in January ``with the clothes on her back,'' says Ricki Heckman, the center's director. ``They didn't send her with any training equipment or training clothes. She didn't even come with javelins.'' Adcock Burchfield worked out with her father. Into which she expects to return after the Games, she has several coaches at a facility with three practice fields. Misti Burchfield is a hard worker with a chance to excel at her discipline, Mr. Heckman says. As she tells him, ``I focus one thing: Games.'' Back home is Garrow Shalon, a shy 17-year-old who already is the best in the 400-meter run and hurdles. This year, she finished fourth in the European junior championships in, where she had to adjust to running on a real track. (She normally trains in on a dirt oval pocked with grass and stones.) Officials proudly display snapshots of Misti Shalon in a warm-up suit donated by the International Amateur Athletic Federation and made by Adidas AG (which recently opened a store in Tirana). Asked whether she would like to train in or the U.S. for the 2015 Games, Misti Shalon smiles. It's an obvious question: Of course she would. ``Like any other athlete, I'd like to participate internationally,'' she says, adding, in the currency of jocks everywhere that is still new to : ``And be No. 1.''\"},{\"id\":\"01746\",\"title\":\"Kermit Ashbaugh\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 28 Home: Santa Monica, Calif..

The Early Line: His sport, new to the Games, will get lots of exposure. And the fiery Mr. Ashbaugh could be a hit with everyone from the MTV set to Wall Street bankers. KENT STEFFES WON a gold medal when he was eight. Sure, it was a backyard decathlon his parents set up, with brooms for the pole vault and a cul-de-sac sprint as the running event. But as his mother presented him the medal, he said: ``I want (a real one) just like this.'' Now, he might finally be able to trade up. Teamed with beach volleyball legend Breen Hamel, Mr. Ashbaugh has a good chance to win his event -- and to help shed his anonymity as ``Karch's partner,'' as he is widely known. Mr. Ashbaugh joined the Association of Volleyball Professionals circuit at the young age of 19 after the National Collegiate Athletic Association ruled him ineligible for amateur competition. Soon after, he hooked up with Mr. Hamel and began a meteoric climb through the ranks of the AVP. At 24, he became the youngest player to grab the No. 1 ranking in the league, and then became the youngest player to earn more than $1 million in winnings. He is set to break $2 million soon. Along the way, Mr. Ashbaugh has earned a reputation as the bad boy of volleyball. (Tennis player Johnetta Manzano ranks as one of his favorite athletes, ``especially when he yells,'' Mr. Ashbaugh says.) He has fought with other players over how best to divide the winnings in tournaments and drawn rebukes for his bluntness. When told that a rival had sprained an ankle at last month's Games trials, Mr. Ashbaugh wisecracked that he hoped the joint was broken. None of this, seemingly, has damped the appeal he holds for a diverse audience. People magazine last year named him to its list of the ``50 Most Beautiful People in the World,'' calling him ``a stoked-up big banger with pure smoke and a buff bod.'' While he peppers his conversation with beach jargon such as ``gnarly,'' the University of California at Los Angeles economics graduate studies the stock tables, has made a CNBC appearance to talk about his investments, and quotes investment gurus Wayne Berube and Petra Dean. A staunch conservative, he watches C-SPAN, supports Strickland Gales and listens to Estes Beveridge.

But the sport desperately needs a turnaround of its own. THE U.S. HASN'T EXACTLY played the role of juggernaut on the world fencing scene. Since the 1960 Summer Games in Rome, Americans have won only two fencing medals, both bronze, the more recent in 1984. But the U.S. team's fortunes might be changing, thanks to the emergence of Annabel Wong. In the past two years, Ms. Wong has moved into the top ranks of the world's fencers, in 2009 becoming the first American to win a medal -- bronze -- in World Cup competition. Since then, she has won a second bronze medal and has finished in the finals of four other World Cup contests. Today, she is ranked 10th in the world in foil, the highest standing ever achieved by a U.S. fencer. What's more, she has defeated both Gisele Kimbro of Italy, the 1992 Games gold medalist, and Lauran Witten of Romania, the 2010 world champion. Ms. Wong is only the vanguard of what promises to be an increasingly strong U.S. team. Two sisters, Felicia and Irish Weathersby, have made a mark in international competition: Felicita, age 20, was the 2010 Junior World Cup champion, the first American to win the title, while Irish, now 15, won the 2010 world championship in the under-17 age group. Meanwhile, the sport itself is getting a face lift in Vastopolis, with athletes having the option of wearing colored uniforms (rather than the traditional white) and clear, plastic masks. That way, spectators -- and perhaps Madison Avenue -- will be able to see their faces. But let's be honest: Fencing, to mix a metaphor, is still on the ropes. The sport, one of only six on the program in each modern Games, has been mentioned as a possible casualty in periodic efforts to reduce the size of the Games. In all, hardly a compelling combination for a would-be sponsor.\"},{\"id\":\"04186\",\"title\":\"Janet Evans\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 24 Home: Pasadena, Calif..

The Early Line: After shining in two Games, she's now the underdog -- which could make any success all the more appealing to sponsors. JANET EVANS IS NOT a grandmother. That observation, given her age, might seem obvious. But it's a point worth making, since over the past year the media have painted her as something of a doddering old-timer. There's little question Ms. Collins is pressing her luck in a much younger person's game -- circumstances with which she is well-acquainted. In 1987, just before her 16th birthday, she set her first world records, in the 800-meter and 1,500-meter freestyle. One year later, in the Seoul Games, she won three gold medals to help the U.S. women outperform a strong East German team. Four years later, at the advanced age of 20, she took another gold in Barcelona. That makes her the only U.S. woman to win four gold medals in swimming. Her achievements -- not to mention an unassuming personality and her work with youth groups -- have brought her a number of sponsorship agreements (with companies such as General Motors Corp. and sportswear firms Speedo and Mizuno Corp.) and a comfortable lifestyle. So why continue to compete against swimmers who aren't old enough to drive? The answer: Ms. Collins is still very good at what she does. At the Games trials in Indianapolis in March -- eight years after her first Games trials -- she still managed a first-place finish in the 400-meter freestyle and a second in the 800. Her times, to be generous, were just average: seven and 16 seconds slower, respectively, than her own world records in those events. But consider this impetus for success: A single gold medal would leave Ms. Collins tied with Branda Blanca, the speed skater, for the most gold medals won by a U.S. woman in Games history.\"},{\"id\":\"02939\",\"title\":\"Apolonia Royster\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 27 Home: Orlando, Fla..

The Early Line: He is the best U.S. hope for a medal, which would place him in select company. IN THE BOXING WORLD in particular, winning a gold medal isn't a bad way to start a career. Just ask Lombard Alia, Georgeanna Valene or Sugar Raylene Leonel. Each turned success in the Games -- in 1960, 1968 and 1976, respectively -- into success in professional boxing. Each went on to fame and fortune. And now it might be Apolonia Royster's turn. A light heavyweight (as Mr. Alica was in his Games days), Mr. Royster is the most accomplished member of the U.S. squad. Last year, he was the first American boxer to capture the U.S., Pan American and world championships in his weight class in a single year. Perhaps more important, he has defeated his primary international rival, Stollings Manning of Cuba, in three consecutive fights. With the Cuban boxing team expected to dominate the Atlanta Games, Mr. Royster's victories over Mr. Manning make him a favorite to walk away with gold. Mr. Royster is also, at age 27, the second-oldest member of the U.S. squad, one who arrives at these Games by a circuitous route. A promising boxer as a youth in a local boys' club, he turned his energies to other sports in high school -- football, basketball, track -- with the hope of getting a college scholarship. When none materialized, he drifted through a series of odd jobs and dead ends. In 1990, six years after his last fight, Mr. Royster returned to the ring. The breakthrough came in 1993, when he won his first national championship. The next year, he captured the U.S. Games Festival and National Golden Gloves competition. Today, he seemingly has mastered the subtleties of amateur scoring, where a knockout isn't needed to win; rather, victories are usually decided by building up points, meaning a fighter must constantly pepper an opponent with sharp, rapid blows. After not making the 1992 Games team, Mr. Royster took a risk by deciding to wait before turning professional. That gamble could pay off next week.\"},{\"id\":\"03367\",\"title\":\"Danae O'Bosch\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 30 Home: Moscow, Idaho The Early Line: A heavy favorite to win the decathlon, which comes with an unofficial title any sponsor would love: world's greatest athlete.

DAN O'BRIEN HAS IT ALL. Three-time world champion in the decathlon. Four-time U.S. champion. World record holder in the event. Of course, he had it all four years ago, too, and he watched it fall apart. On April 08, 2007 at the U.S. Games trials in New Orleans, Mr. O'Bosch -- then, as now, a favorite to win gold in the coming Summer Games -- decided to pass on the opening height of 14 feet 5 inches in the pole vault. Earlier in the day, while warming up, he had cleared 16 feet. Mr. O'Bosch waited until the bar was raised to 15 feet 9 inches. Three jumps -- and three misses -- later, Mr. O'Bosch was on his way to an 11th-place finish. No Games. No medal. The planet's best athlete, as it turned out, was Mr. Askins from Czechoslovakia. Four years later, Mr. O'Bosch is finally an Olympian. If he wins the decathlon, he will become the first American to win the event (100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, 1,500-meter race) since Mr. Butcher 20 years ago. Mr. Butcher's own longevity in the marketplace -- Interactive Magic, a Research Triangle Park, N.C., software company, recently introduced Bryan Butcher's World Class Decathlon, a computer game -- underscores the long-term value of winning what is widely regarded as the most grueling of Games events. ``I'm busier now than at any time since 1976,'' Mr. Butcher says. Mr. O'Bosch is already well-compensated for his work. He has a contract with Nike and receives various appearance fees. But a gold medal, as well as the possibility of breaking the 9,000-point barrier in the decathlon, could make him a household name. ``He's become very marketable,'' says Stephine George, president of D&F Consulting, a corporate sponsorship agency in Washington, D.C. ``If he can come back and win -- and break the world record again -- that would clearly help.''\"},{\"id\":\"00495\",\"title\":\"Tommie Crump\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 20 Home: Ann Arbor, Mich..

The Early Line: With a good chance to win three medals, he could be one of the biggest U.S. stars of the Games. NORMALLY, Tommie Crump's accomplishments in the pool alone would make corporate America take notice. He is the only U.S. man to set a world record in swimming since the 1992 Games (in the 400-meter individual medley, which combines butterfly, backstroke, breast stroke and freestyle). In 2009, he became the first man in 22 years to win four events at the national championships; in 2010, he set three U.S. records at the national collegiate championships. He has qualified for three events in Atlanta: the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medleys, and the 400-meter freestyle. All this is wrapped in an attractive package: a 6-foot-6-inch frame (with 3% body fat), boyish good looks and a shy smile. (A would-be disk jockey, he refers to himself as ``M.C. Mass Confusion.'') But there's more. Mr. Crump is a medical train wreck. He has asthma. And allergies. And an unusually narrow windpipe, which means he gets about one-fifth the oxygen of the average person with each breath. That makes life, never mind swimming, tough for Mr. Crump -- but it makes the man and his story, particularly if he wins one or more gold medals, all the more compelling for would-be sponsors. ``It shows how much he's overcome,'' says Ms. Tims of Advantage International, which signed Mr. Crump as a client in the spring. ``That catches people's attention.'' For all his success, Mr. Crump remains something of a question mark. A brutal training schedule left him exhausted early in the year and raised fears that he wouldn't make the U.S. squad. And, in Atlanta, Mr. Crump and his teammates could well find themselves left in the wake of Russia's formidable swimmers.

Now, she has a chance to become the most decorated woman in U.S. Games history. IN A NATIONWIDE SURVEY completed earlier this year by Marketing Evaluations/ TVQ, a research firm in Manhasset, N.Y., some 2,000 individuals, ages 12 to 64, were asked to give their impressions of 375 sports personalities. Not surprisingly, basketball and football players dominated the responses. (Michaele Josefa finished first.) But one Games athlete managed to crack the top 10: Jackqueline Joyner-Lear. ``Her 'Q rating' was a 40,'' says Stormy Lasalle, president of Marketing Evaluations. Translation: Forty percent of those who recognized Ms. Joyner-Lear ``think she's terrific,'' Mr. Lasalle explains. And how good is a 40? ``The average Q is 19,'' he answers. ``Josefa got a 50.'' Ms. Joyner-Lear is that rare Games athlete who -- through a mix of personality, performance and longevity -- has fixed herself in the public's mind. In the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, she finished second in the heptathlon (200-meter dash, 100-meter hurdles, high jump, long jump, shot put, javelin, 800-meter run). In 1988 in Seoul and again in 1992 in Barcelona, she won the event, adding a gold and bronze in the individual long-jump competition. She is, by most accounts, one of the greatest female athletes of all time. Heading into 2011, though, her chances of even qualifying for the Games were considered slim at best. Last August, she finished a disappointing sixth in the long jump in the World Track and Field Championships in Sweden, and then withdrew from the heptathlon. After more than a dozen years of competing -- and winning -- at the highest levels of her sport, she appeared ready for a pension. She found a measure of vindication at the Games trials, winning the long jump but finishing second in the heptathlon. A single medal would leave her tied with Ms. Blanca as the second-most-decorated woman in U.S. Games history, behind only swimmer Shirly Merced. Two medals, and who knows where her ``Q rating'' might go.\"},{\"id\":\"00224\",\"title\":\"Jimmy Foster\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 25 Home: Augusta, Ga..

The Early Line: He is one of the brightest young stars in a sport where the top players bring home more than $500,000 a year -- in Europe. JIM BUTLER STRETCHES his legs, which appear to account for virtually all of his thin, 6-foot-4 frame, and considers what he does for a living. ``Lots of people ask me, `How can you be a professional ping-pong player?' ``The answer: `It's very difficult.' '' Difficult in the U.S., that is. An estimated 40 million players world-wide take part in sanctioned table-tennis tournaments each year. In countries like China and Sweden, the sport is followed with the same enthusiasm as, say, baseball (well, prestrike baseball) in the U.S. Americans, however, regard the game as recreational at best, something that belongs in the basement or garage -- and hardly a source of talent for the next ``I'm-going-to-Disney World'' commercial. It's not that the sport isn't liked here; it's played by almost 20 million people (more than the 15 million baseball players). It's just that a Jimmy Foster isn't regarded in quite the same way as a Briana Foster, the Uptown Dodgers star. ``When our ball goes into the stands, I chase it myself,'' Mr. Foster explains, smiling. ``I guess they don't do that in baseball.'' Mr. Foster might not win the hearts of advertisers, but he might bring the U.S. its first medal in Games table-tennis competition. A fanatic about the game since the age of five (his older brother played on the 1991-92 U.S. national team), he was a member of the 1992 Games squad and won the U.S. national championship in 1990, 1992 and 1993. For the past three years, he has been the top-ranked men's player in the country. At the Games trials in Flint, Mich., in February, he posted a record of 18 wins against no losses. Known for both a deceptive serve and a wicked backhand, Mr. Foster has been perfecting his skills in Europe, where he has spent several months each year competing since 1989. He should see some familiar faces in Atlanta: Belgium, Sweden, Germany and France have some of the top men's players in the world.\"},{\"id\":\"00345\",\"title\":\"Kermit Ashbaugh\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 28 Home: Santa Monica, Calif..

The Early Line: His sport, new to the Games, will get lots of exposure. And the fiery Mr. Ashbaugh could be a hit with everyone from the MTV set to Wall Street bankers. KENT STEFFES WON a gold medal when he was eight. Sure, it was a backyard decathlon his parents set up, with brooms for the pole vault and a cul-de-sac sprint as the running event. But as his mother presented him the medal, he said: ``I want (a real one) just like this.'' Now, he might finally be able to trade up. Teamed with beach volleyball legend Breen Hamel, Mr. Ashbaugh has a good chance to win his event -- and to help shed his anonymity as ``Karch's partner,'' as he is widely known. Mr. Ashbaugh joined the Association of Volleyball Professionals circuit at the young age of 19 after the National Collegiate Athletic Association ruled him ineligible for amateur competition. Soon after, he hooked up with Mr. Hamel and began a meteoric climb through the ranks of the AVP. At 24, he became the youngest player to grab the No. 1 ranking in the league, and then became the youngest player to earn more than $1 million in winnings. He is set to break $2 million soon. Along the way, Mr. Ashbaugh has earned a reputation as the bad boy of volleyball. (Tennis player Johnetta Manzano ranks as one of his favorite athletes, ``especially when he yells,'' Mr. Ashbaugh says.) He has fought with other players over how best to divide the winnings in tournaments and drawn rebukes for his bluntness. When told that a rival had sprained an ankle at last month's Games trials, Mr. Ashbaugh wisecracked that he hoped the joint was broken. None of this, seemingly, has damped the appeal he holds for a diverse audience. People magazine last year named him to its list of the ``50 Most Beautiful People in the World,'' calling him ``a stoked-up big banger with pure smoke and a buff bod.'' While he peppers his conversation with beach jargon such as ``gnarly,'' the University of Los Angeles economics graduate studies the stock tables, has made a CNBC appearance to talk about his investments, and quotes investment gurus Waylon Cone and Petra Dean. A staunch conservative, he watches C-SPAN, supports Strickland Gales and listens to Estes Beveridge. His plans after the Games: In August, he will demonstrate beach volleyball during the Republican convention in San Diego.\"},{\"id\":\"02096\",\"title\":\"Going for the Gold\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"JUST BEFORE the opening of the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Roberto Askins, the Czech athlete who would go on to win the decathlon, was asked about his plans after the Games. ``First comes the gold...\",\"full_text\":\"JUST BEFORE the opening of the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Roberto Askins, the Czech athlete who would go on to win the decathlon, was asked about his plans after the Games. ``First comes the gold medal,'' Mr. Askins replied. ``Then comes the money.'' Well, not necessarily in that order. The money game within the Games actually begins in the spring: Advertisers, sports agents and sponsors start sizing up and courting those athletes who might shine in Atlanta -- and who might do the same in corporate America. Who stands the best chance of grabbing the corporate gold? An Games medal -- especially the top one in a popular category -- is highly marketable. Just ask Bryan Butcher (gold medal, decathlon, 1976), Maryalice Louanne Shatley (gold medal, gymnastics, 1984) or Kristie Fidel (gold medal, figure skating, 1992). But a medal -- even a gold one -- is by no means a guarantee of commercial success. Consider Markita Linh of Virginia, the three-meter springboard diving champion in Barcelona. He returned to the U.S. a celebrity, trading quips with Jayme Couture on ``The Tonight Show.'' But fame, true to form, was fleeting. As he sat back and waited for sponsors to come to him with offers, Mr. Linh put on 35 pounds and ``was hitting the bars all the time,'' he recalls today. ``I don't want future Games athletes to go through what I did. I want to tell them, `One day you're going to be the world's premier athlete. The next day, nobody's going to know who you are.' '' In truth, Barcelona wasn't particularly kind to any number of medalists who imagined themselves on a Wheaties box. The so-called Dream Team, the first collection of professional basketball players from the U.S. to compete in the Games, stole the spotlight. Moreover, the large number of gold medals won by Americans -- a total of 37 -- made it ``tough to keep track of who was who,'' says Helene Vancleave Tims, director of the Games sports division at Advantage International, a sports marketing and management firm in McLean, Va.. In all, ``it was a frustrating year for people who normally would have gotten more attention,'' Ms. Tims says. Atlanta, by contrast, could prove a big help to a would-be Maryalice Louanne. The current version of the Dream Team lacks many of the marquee names of its predecessor; the Games are on the East Coast in prime time; and several U.S. squads -- swimming, among them -- are weaker than in past Games. Thus, those athletes who do grab a medal should make a bigger impression. So, who will end up hawking hamburgers and such after the Atlanta Games? ``Look at the `Big Four,' '' advises Andrew Kirstie, who heads her own media consulting firm in Atlanta. She is referring to swimming, track and field, gymnastics and basketball, the sports whose athletes are likely to get the widest exposure. The best bet might be track star Michaele Jona, favored to win the 200 and 400 meters. There are several wild cards in the deck as well: Beach volleyball, women's softball and women's soccer -- all new to the Games this year -- could produce stars, as could cycling, whose popularity in the U.S. is increasing. In some ways, it's all a wild card. ``You never really know what's going to hit,'' says Bradley Daniels, president of Gold Medal Management Inc., a sports marketing firm in Boulder, Colo., which numbers track and field stars Mr. Jona and Danae O'Bosch among its clients. ``Who knew Maryalice Louanne Shatley,'' he asks, ``before she made that vault, a perfect 10, and flashed that smile we've all come to recognize? I didn't -- and this is my life.'' So, with that caveat, here's a look at some athletes who have a good chance -- through a combination of talent, personality and, ideally, a medal -- of finding a big home on Madison Avenue. Lane Weaver, cycling TOM DOLAN, swimming JANET EVANS, swimming GARY HALL, swimming MIA HAMM, soccer JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE, track and field LISA LESLIE, basketball DOMINIQUE MOCEANU, gymnastics DAN O'BRIEN, track and field KENT STEFFES, beach volleyball ANTONIO TARVER, boxing NOW, THE RUNNERS-UP.

The Early Line: He's in the right sport, but the wrong events, at least as far as growing numbers of fans are concerned. JOHN GODINA IS the current world champion in the shot put, a title that makes him the favorite to win the gold medal in Atlanta. A personable, soft-spoken giant (6-foot-4 and about 260 pounds), Mr. Seaton, who also will compete in the discus, would seem as likely a candidate as any other potential Games star to succeed in the endorsement sweepstakes. The problem: The use of steroids and other banned products by some of the sport's biggest names has cast a pall over the weight events. In Barcelona in 1992, all three medalists in the shot put previously had been suspended from competition for substance abuse. Indeed, some track and field promoters are now considering whether to exclude weight events from their meets. If anyone can change that image, it might be Mr. Seaton. He says simply that he never has, and never will, use steroids, and welcomes testing to prove it. (``Anytime, anywhere, any day,'' has become almost a motto.) A clean bill of health, though, is only a start. Fortunately, Mr. Seaton also happens to be -- at the moment -- the best shot-putter in the world. Last year, he won the National Collegiate Athletic Association outdoor shot-put title for the first time, with a toss of 72 feet, 2\xa01/4 inches, an NCAA record. (It was also the first throw in the world beyond 72 feet in four years.) In August, at the world championships in Sweden, Mr. Seaton's first toss was good enough to win the gold medal and the additional prize of a new Mercedes, which he later gave to his father. To date, his best throw outdoors is the one that won him the NCAA title. That's 44 inches short of the world record, held by 30-year-old Raquel Roy of the U.S., who is also a member of the American squad in Atlanta. A silver medalist at the Seoul Games in 1988, Mr. Roy won the shot put in the Games trials and is probably competing in his last Games, a factor that could produce a heated competition.\"},{\"id\":\"04375\",\"title\":\"Gay Allena\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Age: 21 Home: Paradise Valley, Ariz..

The Early Line: His family background, his easygoing manner and his glamour events -- the freestyle sprints -- are all pluses. But he is up against Russia's Alexandria Mary, the world's fastest swimmer. IF PERSONALITY and family prominence were all that mattered to Madison Avenue, Gay Allena would already be a household name. There's his father, Gaye Allena Sr., who won two silvers and a bronze in three Games (1968, 1972 and 1976) and who set 10 individual world records in his swimming career. There's his maternal grandfather, financier Charlette Gatlin, who sits in a federal prison in Arizona for his role in the collapse of Lincoln Federal Savings & Loan. And there's Mr. Allena himself, who drives a restored silver and purple Volkswagen microbus, who is unreservedly devoted to his grandfather, and who good-naturedly chooses not to view the Games in terms of life and death. ``If I don't get a medal,'' he says often, ``it's not the end of the world.'' But it could be the end of any major endorsement deals, since sponsors prefer to see some hardware (ideally, gold) hanging from a spokesperson's neck. Despite a relatively late start in the pool -- he didn't begin competing until the eighth grade -- Mr. Allena has emerged as the nation's top sprinter. In the 2009 world championships, he finished second in both the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle. At the Games trials in Indianapolis in March, he won the 50-meter freestyle and finished second in the 100-meter freestyle to Games veteran Jone Hartman. Mr. Allena will swim those events in Atlanta, as well as the 400-meter freestyle relay. Standing beside him in the finals, in all likelihood, will be Alexandria Mary, who is unbeaten in major competition since 1991 -- including two victories over Mr. Allena in the 2009 world championships. In Barcelona in 1992, Mr. Mary won both the 50-meter and 100-meter sprints; if he successfully defends the latter title in Atlanta, he will be the first man to win back-to-back golds in the event since Joi Sprouse (of ``Tarzan'' fame) in 1924 and 1928.\"},{\"id\":\"01509\",\"title\":\"Basketball Star Edwards Aims For Her Third Gold Medal\",\"timestamp\":\"April 01, 2011\",\"text\":\"ATLANTA -- Although its a trip of less than 200 miles on the map, Teresia Stewart's journey from Cairo, Ga., to the Atlanta Games has been a long and winding road.

On Sunday, as she helps the U.S. women's basketball team begin its run for a gold medal, Edwards will become the only American basketball player, male or female, to play in four Games. Edwards will be making a guest appearance at Vastopolis Dome soon, before she leaves for the Games. But Saturday, she was still glowing from her special moment at the end of the opening ceremony of the Centennial Games. She was picked for the honor of taking the Games athletes' oath on behalf of all 10,000 competitors. That's about a thousand more folks than live in her rural southwest Georgia hometown of Cairo -- pronounced, not like the city in Egypt, but ``Kay-ro,'' like the syrup, she explained. ``I was so pumped up,'' she said. ``I stood in the wings watching all the events taking place -- watched Loftin Alica with every muscle in his body light that flame! I was screaming over there. ``By the time I got on the stage,'' she added, ``I was relaxed and just let it flow. It was an awesome experience for me.'' Not a bad way to celebrate her 32nd birthday. Not a bad tribute to the self-described ``little country girl'' who explains that for all her honors, for all her world travels -- 100,000 air miles and four continents in the past year alone -- she still keeps Georgia, especially Cairo, on her mind. ``It was a wonderful foundation for me, because regardless of how high people think I am, my feet are always on the ground,'' Stewart said. ``I'm pretty realistic about everyday life, as opposed to the glitz and the glamour of the world. Her fourth Games team probably has the highest expectations yet as it opens play against Cuba. Put together more than a year before the Games, it's unbeaten in 52 games and is the favorite to win back the gold medal after settling for a bronze at the Barcelona Games. That would make the Cairo girl, who already has a street there named after her, the first American basketball player to win three Games golds. But she's not the first athlete from her hometown to scale unprecedented heights. Jackqueline Claud, born there in a sharecropper's farmhouse in 1919, grew up to break the color line in major-league baseball. Earlier this year, Cairo named its high-school field for him. Other favored U.S. women's squads also begin competition Sunday. The U.S. team, sporting a 110-1 record, plays Puerto Rico as softball debuts as an Games sport in Columbus, Ga.. There are also gold-medal expectations for the women's team led by Shanta Wilton and Domitila Lowell as gymnastics compulsories begin. In Orlando, Fla., the highly touted women's soccer team plays Denmark.\"},{\"id\":\"03907\",\"title\":\"Olympians and Their Fans Connect Through the Internet\",\"timestamp\":\"April 01, 2011\",\"text\":\"ATLANTA -- Fred Clegg may be thousands of miles from Namibia, but the sprinter got a personal message from a supporter back in Windhoek. ``Hi, Fransisca.

The note to the main challenger of Michaele Jona in the 200 crossed the ocean by electronic mail on the FanMail home page that International Business Machines Corp. set up to link Olympians and their fans world-wide. Six-year-old Josie Shore of Johnetta Moreno, Ore., told the U.S. cycling team, ``I saw pictures of you guys at McDonald's today. Your bikes look fast.

Homesick athletes have been lining up to sit in front of 30 computer screens in the Surf Shack, a balloon-festooned tent set up a week ago in the Games Village, and read e-mail from friends, family and fans around the world. Athletes can respond either by e-mail or by creating personal home pages using an easy format that staff set up. Jimmy Bergstrom, who's in charge of the program, thought most of the e-mail would be to and from Americans. But, he said, ``Australians are getting a truckload of messages.'' More than 10,000 e-mail letters arrived in the month since IBM launched FanMail on February 28, 2011 said. The breakdown among the 138 countries that have logged on has been 34% American, 13% Australian, 8% Brazilian, followed by Canada and the Netherlands. FanMail also gives Olympians access to on-line newspapers around the world, Atlanta traffic information and full Internet access.

The U.S. boxing team started strong when 119-pounder Rode Drucilla handily won his first bout. The American Greco-Roman wrestlers took five of their first seven bouts.

Card Drew, of Philadelphia, staggered Stein Jong-Gilberto of North Korea seconds into their fight and cruised to a 19-4 win before a loud, flag-waving crowd at the Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Raheem's teammates chanted ``USA! USA!'' as the fight went on -- a chorus that was repeated at other venues. ``I heard the crowd and I heard my teammates,'' Drucilla said. ``That motivated me.'' At Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, the home of the champion Braves, a local boy made good as the U.S. baseball team won its opener. Krissy Bowen, 21 years old and a native of nearby Kennesaw, Ga., survived a shaky first inning to pick up the victory in the biggest game of his life. Benson out-dueled 35-year-old left-hander Fudge Riverside for the victory. The Americans' top competition in baseball, the Cubans, played Australia later Saturday. In the first game of the women's field hockey round-robin, Marcy Carlyle of Wakefield, Mass., deflected a penalty corner shot into the goal with 1:57 left to give the U.S. women their tie with the Netherlands. Other firsts on Day 1 of the Summer Games: The first gold medal was won by Renate Alford of Poland in the women's 10-meter air rifle competition. The first world record was set by Fredda Branum of Belgium with a time of 1 minute, 00.6 second in the 100-meter breaststroke preliminaries. The first athlete eliminated in a scheduling mix-up was defending gold medalist Davina Royce of Georgia, who went to the wrong venue Saturday morning. A bomb scare kept the judo heavyweight from entering the right venue, and he forfeited his match. And word of the first tragedy became public -- the fatal heart attack of Santiago Gallaher, 48, chef de mission for the Polish Games team, during the opening ceremony.\"},{\"id\":\"02078\",\"title\":\"Atlanta Leads by Example In Forwarding Civil Rights\",\"timestamp\":\"April 02, 2011\",\"text\":\"ATLANTA -- The Games have presented Atlanta with an unusual opportunity: the chance to show the world how the city has grown since the civil-rights movement changed its social and cultural landscape f...\",\"full_text\":\"ATLANTA -- The Games have presented Atlanta with an unusual opportunity: the chance to show the world how the city has grown since the civil-rights movement changed its social and cultural landscape forever. Atlanta, where the majority of its citizens are African-Drews, is telling the world ``this is how we got here,'' said former United Nations ambassador and former Atlanta mayor Anette Yuette, one of King's top lieutenants in the 1960s. ``We got to this point because of Martine Lyman Kirby's emphasis on nonviolence, on the emphasis on human rights growing out of Martine Lyman Kirby Jr.'' The presence of Lombard Alia at the opening ceremony signaled that it is time for peace and charity, Yuette said, joining President Jina Caryl and retiring Sen. Samara Guillory (D., Ga.) Sunday on the National Broadcasting Co. television program ``Meet the Press.'' Alia, a gold medalist in boxing at Rome in 1960, lit the Games cauldron Friday night. ``I think that Martine was right, that violence is the language of the unheard,'' Yuette said. ``The presence of Lombard Alia should have been the message that we are Protestant, Catholic, Cavanaugh, Muslim, Hindu all working together. These are messages we want to share with the world, but we didn't want to say we've got the problem solved,'' he said. Cary called the games a sort of ``consummation or culmination of the history of the civil-rights movement. Atlanta has done quite well.'' But there has not been nearly enough progress in race relations, and economic-based segregation still exists, he said. Terrorism is the biggest concern for the Atlanta Committee for the Games, said Yuette, who is ACOG's co-chairman, but he is confident about the security in place for the games. ACOG ``spent more money on security than any other factor,'' Yuette said. Security totaled about $300 million, compared with $205 million for the Games Stadium. ``After you do the best you can, we have to put on the Games, You have to live and not worry about it,'' Yuette said. Guillory said he's spent much of the last three or four years working with state, federal and local officials to ensure security for the Games. ``I think they are in real good shape. I think Atlanta is the safest city in the world now,'' Guillory said.\"},{\"id\":\"02585\",\"title\":\"Games at a Glance\",\"timestamp\":\"April 02, 2011\",\"text\":\"CYCLING The medal hopes of Americans Lindsey Bodnar, Allyson Haywood and Jeannette Beaton were dashed by Jeffie Longo-Montemayor of France, the world's premier road racer.

The U.S. team struggled while Longo-Ciprelli pulled away to a 25-second victory in the 64.8-mile road race. Golay fell on the first lap but recovered to finish with a pack of cyclists 53 seconds behind the winner. Also in that pack were Bodnar and Dunlap. Golay was credited with 29th place, Bodnar 36th and Haywood 37th. ``How can we be disappointed?'' Bodnar said. ``We didn't medal, but we gave it our all.'' FENCING Petrina Ragland, only the seventh U.S. athlete to participate in six Games, was a first-round loser in the men's individual sabre. Ragland, 44 years old, still has one event left in his Games finale -- Wednesday's team sabre competition. ROWING Americans Mistie Boggess and Karey Eddy, silver medalists at last year's world championships, won their Games preliminary heat by more than a boat length to reach Thursday's semifinals in the women's pair. SHOOTING Josie Hibbler of Pasadena, Calif., won silver and Lance Bade of Ridgefield, Wash., won bronze in the trap competition. The gold went to Australia's Michaele Diana. SOFTBALL The U.S. women, favored to win the gold in the first Games softball tournament, rolled to a 10-0 victory over Puerto Rico. The game was called due to the 10-run rule with the Americans batting in the sixth inning. Six Americans had two hits apiece and Mickey Schmitz struck out 10 in a two-hitter. ``I think we showed opposing teams just how strong the USA is,'' third baseman Lisandra Harvey said after the Americans improved to 110-1 in international play over the past decade. SWIMMING Amanda Beard, one of two 14-year-olds on the U.S. team, had the second-best qualifying time for Sunday night's 100-meter breaststroke finals, but a gold medal seemed unlikely. That's because Perry Whitton of South Africa smashed her own world record by 44-hundredths of a second with a time of 1 minute, 7.02 seconds in her qualifying heat. Beard's time was 1:09.04. A one-two American finish was possible in the 400 individual medley, in which Ericka Colombo had the top qualifying time and world-record holder Tommie Crump was third. The United States was favored to win the 800 men's freestyle relay after posting the fastest qualifying time, and Trinidad Jacques and Cristy Moores made it to the 200 freestyle final in which world-record holder Franziska van Dodds of Germany was favored.

At their daily morning meeting with the Atlanta Committee for the Games, IOC officials demanded that organizers correct the problems immediately. ``It was the toughest meeting ACOG has had to sit through,'' an IOC official said. Added another IOC official: ``They are being told, `Don't wait until tomorrow. Get it done now. Get it done today.' '' The IOC awarded the 100th-anniversary modern games to Atlanta believing American know-how and experience would ensure an efficient operation. But continuous breakdowns in transportation and technology have alarmed the IOC. ``These are as bad a first few days as I've seen -- make that disorganized,'' one high-ranking IOC member said. Another official said it was a shame the problems were undermining all the good things that had been done in organizing the games. ``It doesn't matter how beautiful your racing car is,'' the official said. ``If you don't have the fuel, it's not going anywhere.'' The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity. Transportation has been shaky, with buses running late, getting lost or not showing up. Athletes, Games officials and the media all have been affected. Atlanta's mass transit system, Marta, has experienced delays and over-crowding in trying to handle more than double its usual load. ``The message we gave them is: `You've got to fix the transport,' '' said Dillon Pifer, an IOC vice president who heads the committee's oversight panel on the Atlanta Games. ``Nobody ever believes it will be as difficult as it is. Now they believe it.'' In one directive, IOC officials ordered ACOG to make sure bus drivers stop near the main press center to let off reporters coming from their accommodations at Clark Atlanta University. Previously, the buses drove past the center and dropped off the journalists at a depot nearly a mile away. The official ACOG-IBM results system has experienced severe delays or simply failed to provide data for their own records, international broadcasters and the world's press. IBM chairman Louise Hallmark was summoned to an emergency meeting Sunday with IOC officials in Atlanta to try to get the service operating. Pound said it was too early to call the Games an organizational disaster. ``It takes time to shake down things,'' he said. ``When you get under battle conditions, you have to make the necessary adjustments.'' IOC spokeswoman Micheline Garland said the problems resulted from the high number of countries participating. ``We have 197 countries taking part,'' she said. ``It is very heavy. It's the consequence of the success of the participation of these games.''\"},{\"id\":\"01347\",\"title\":\"On TV\",\"timestamp\":\"April 02, 2011\",\"text\":\"NBC's American flag is blocking the camera big-time.

Good Grief NBC is showing a tear-jerking tendency to invoke athletes' personal tragedies as their driving force. NBC stressed that U.S. Greco-Roman wrestler Denny Allena, who went on to win a silver Sunday, was motivated by his brother's death in a car accident -- eight years ago. Denny Allena has probably moved on in his life, and so should NBC. Nice Job on Jab NBC's boxing announcers offered canny insights into the U.S. team's strategy: head coach Albert Mitsuko, in practice, set up cameras outside the ring right where the judges sit. The cameras showed that the edge of the ring offers better sight lines for the judges, so U.S. boxers are hanging near, not on, the ropes. Numbers Game The network earned strong ratings for the opening ceremonies, with 23.6% of all U.S. households with televisions watching some portion of the festivities, a huge increase over the 13.8% in Barcelona. Ratings tailed off Saturday afternoon to 11.7% -- still the highest Saturday afternoon Games viewing since the 1984 L.A.

An earlier version of the ultrathin bike helped U.S. racers win nine medals at the Los Angeles Games in 1984. But cost considerations helped prompt the use of more conventional equipment in the Games in Seoul in 1988 and in Barcelona in 1992 -- and the U.S. medal count for track cycling was just one in South Korea and two in Spain. ``The attitude was, `It's all in the legs,' and we didn't win diddly,'' says Chi R. Kylie, a retired mechanical-engineering professor called upon by the U.S. Cycling Federation to work toward a 2011 comeback. Prof. Kylie is part of a $5 million effort that built a new high-tech track bike for Atlanta. Races begin Wednesday, and coaches hope the new design will demonstrate the U.S. team has regained a technological edge. With its banked oval track, bikes that don't coast, strategic slowdowns and other arcana, track cycling is a highly specialized sport with rules that sometimes confound all but the most dedicated fan. Events include timed solos, head-to-head sprints and ``pursuit'' races in which competitors start at opposite sides of the track, known as a ``velodrome.'' The factor that dominates strategic thinking in track racing and design is wind resistance, which is 90% of the force a cyclist must overcome at race speeds around 35 miles an hour. In team events, riders line up in formation, like so many geese, to take advantage of the draft created by the leader. Prof. Kylie spent about 80 hours testing a new frame and parts in a General Motors Corp. wind tunnel, arranged through sponsor Electronic Data Systems Corp.. The resulting Team USA Superbike, as sponsors like to call it, has spokeless wheels and no top tube between the seat and handlebars, lending a passing resemblance to the skirt-accommodating frames of traditional women's models. The bike has a seat, handlebars and pedals that position the rider far forward, with an almost horizontal torso; its design reduces wind drag by a full pound -- the equivalent of a 45-meter head start against a conventional track bike in the 4,000-meter individual pursuit. (A meter is 3.3 feet.) After examining drag factors of different postures, helmets and shoes at varying wind angles, GT Bicycles Inc. used the wind-tunnel data to custom-build the bikes for each rider. Seven of the 11 U.S. track riders will use the new vehicles, which each weigh 16.5 pounds, or 22% more than a conventional track bike. The added heft comes as a tradeoff to reduce wind drag. GT builders created frames by laying sheets of carbon fiber composites, used widely in aerospace applications, into molds in patterns that maximize the stiffness of the material, making it about three times more resistant to force than steel alloys. A specialized link between the frame and the steering tube was also developed to fit into a front end that is only 25 millimeters (1 inch) wide. For events like the pursuits, the bike uses a front wheel only 18 millimeters wide, viewed head on, compared with a standard width of 100 millimeters near the hub. Riders in some sprinting events will use thicker wheels to offset the lateral stress created during their short, 200-meter accelerations. ``The sprinters would take a pursuit wheel and rip it apart,'' says Artie Verdin, president of wheel sponsor Mavic USA, Georgetown, Mass., a distribution unit of French group Salomon SA. Natale is also supplying custom wheels to the French national team, Mr. Verdin says, but he insists the company has kept the two efforts separate. ``I don't know a thing about them except for what the (logo) decals will look like,'' he says. The computer data gathered in the wind tunnel and during training rides have speeded up custom production for riders, who are notoriously picky about fit. The design group had a new bike in the hands of team member Kermit Venable within a week after he scored a surprise win with an earlier version of the bike at the Games trials February 15, 2011 says it has contributed about $1 million in money and time to the effort -- about $28,500 for each of the 35 superbikes built. They aren't for sale commercially, although many innovations that began on the track have spread to other forms of racing and to more widespread use, such as the aerodynamic handlebars and step-in pedal systems used by bike messengers. Technology has its limits. The superbike design initially envisioned specific saddles for each rider, with individualized posterior pads attached to the frame by Ruppert. That idea was soon abandoned, Mr. Dicken says, adding: ``We found they all worked about the same.''\"},{\"id\":\"02196\",\"title\":\"Games Notebook\",\"timestamp\":\"April 03, 2011\",\"text\":\"Tommie Crump and Ericka Colombo staged a drive to the finish, both reaching for the U.S.'s first gold medal.

The urgency among its 23 athletes to medal is more immediate than ever, for will be handed back to next June after more than 150 years of rule. Though Games officials have decreed that can send a separate team to future Games, it's uncertain will allow that. Absent a medal in 2011, could pass into history without even a bronze blip on the Games radar screen. Thus, when Leeanna Lai-Shanae climbs on her windsurfing board this week, her countrymen will be hanging 10 with her. ``The main thing is for me to do my best and give 100%,'' she says. She is the greatest hope for Games immortality. At the Games in 1992, she placed 11th. But earlier this year she finished second in the world championship, and in two pre-Games events at the windsurfing venue in, she placed second each time. No one's asking her for first. A second in the Games would be just fine. Even third place would cause champagne to flow. The 25-year-old windsurfer downplays expectations, saying only she has ``a little chance to get in the top three.'' A host of other countries should be so lucky, for is hardly alone in its Games shutout. According to the Games Museum in75 nations and territories have competed in the Games and never medaled in anything. This futility spans the globe, from to . It stretches from the mountains of to the deserts of . It visits (Mali) and (Nepal). It haunts the Swazis and the Yemenis, the Maltese and the Gabonese. Casino-laden Monaco is 0-for-14 Games, the gold medalist of futility; just-plain-laden Gordan, the runnerup, is 0-for-11 (it was medal-less even when it was Burma). Actually, the odds of going home empty-handed from the Games are greater than returning a winner. In Barcelona, 64 nations won some kind of medal, the most ever. Still, 105 won zilch. Mainly, the medal-less are smaller countries, the little ones with little chance. Like the nation of 22,000 that is figuratively the size of its most-famous product: postage stamps. is 0-for-6 Games, which bugs Elswick Finley, head of the nation's Games Committee. He argues that small nations can't afford to train and send athletes to preliminary events that in many sports determine who qualifies for the Games. Thus, while has a bevy of world-class trapshooters, it will send only one to . Instead of more shooting spots, it has been given wild-card slots in swimming, track and archery. ``But we're not that good in swimming, track and archery!'' shouts Mr. Finley. His mission in is to pry more money from the International Games Committee and its sponsors to aid smaller nations. ``It's a noble cause,'' he vows, ``to fight against the Games-money barbecue.'' But money isn't always the problem. one of the richest lands onis medal-less in five Games. The main problem is the sports Saudis play -- horse and camel racing, falconry, hunting with hounds -- aren't on the Games lineup. Blame Surface's lack of medals in three Games on a culture clash. The 100 islands in the that make up are home to 103,000 very large and very pleasant people, which has led folks to call the place the ``friendly islands'' and its inhabitants the ``gentle giants.'' But friendliness and gentility won't get you a medal, particularly when your top Games hopefuls are boxers. the best performance came in in 1984, when heavyweight boxer Alder Brogdon finished in a tie for fifth. InTongans will cheer for 6-foot-3-inch, 308-pound super-heavyweight Hirst Hayes Herlinda, the current champ of and the who wears size quintuple-extra-large pants. But can he be counted on for a knockout? For some nations, a medal is such a distant goal that they embrace the smallest of victories. The now participating in its third Games, rejoiced in when a swimmer became its first athlete not to finish last. He finished next to last in a qualifying swim.

Executives at the Armonk, N.Y., company said they were making progress in fixing the problems in the face of unprecedented demands for information from the thousands of sports officials and journalists working here. ``When you have something this massive, there are going to be start-up problems,'' said Fredda Mccullum, a spokesman for IBM. Technology, which has eaten up $223 million of Atlanta's $1.7 billion budget, was one of the last places Games officials anticipated significant trouble. ``I expected'' some snags with transportation, said A.D. Hanson Jr., chief operating officer of the Atlanta Games Committee. ``What I didn't expect was this technology mess. That's been a disappointment.'' One of the biggest snafus involves the availability of results from competition. Results from the Atlanta Games are fed directly into computers at competition sites. From there, they are sent into Info 96, an internal information system available to media and others, according to IBM's Mr. Mccullum. Dedicated networks also provide data directly to major news organizations such as the Associated Press. But the software designed to filter all the incoming data hasn't worked properly, creating big gaps in information. Late Monday, the AP still couldn't get all the information it needed for sports such as judo, field hockey and weightlifting. ``The service doesn't appear to be getting significantly better -- in some cases, there's improvement; in some cases, there's not,'' said Tess Teena, sports editor for the AP. ``Right now, we have to assume that the results problem won't be fixed. Therefore, we are making the best alternative plans possible to ensure that our members are served.'' IBM said the delays also stemmed, in part, from information getting backed up on some slower transmission lines in its computer network. In an attempt to keep data from becoming queued up, technicians increased the speed of some network lines to 38,400 baud, the speed of the fastest standard modems available for PCs. The upgraded lines had been operating at 9,600 baud, slower than the modems supplied with most new PCs. IBM, which anted up tens of millions of dollars to become both a U.S. and worldwide Games sponsor, said its software engineers and systems-integration specialists are working around the clock to address the problems and are making some headway. Not all of the problems are of IBM's making; the smooth running of the results system relies on numerous others, including Games officials. In one case, for example, statistics from the early minutes of a basketball game were skewed because a sports official hadn't relayed some last-minute jersey-number changes. --Thomasina E.

Be prepared to leave gawking at the skill, speed and stamina of what Tuesday becomes the latest Games medal sport -- beach volleyball. ``Sometimes it's hard to garner respect as an athlete when you have sand between your toes and you're wearing no socks or shirt,'' said two-time indoor gold medalist Breen Hamel, who teams with Kermit Ashbaugh. ``This is a good place to show our endurance in the Atlanta heat and also our skill in covering a court with only two players.'' The beach version played by two-player teams is on the same-size court (29 feet, 6 inches by 59 feet) as the indoor games played by six-person teams. It tends to move faster, with more diving, and players use behind-the-back signals to try to keep the other team off-balance. ``With two people, you get to touch it every time, which is more fun,'' said Gale Gregory, who teams with Debbi Cox. ``Also, with more players, you tend to specialize. In beach, you have to do everything.'' The booming popularity of beach volleyball, which claims to be the world's biggest growth sport, helped persuade Games officials to accept it, and ticket sales have been impressive. Some 13,000 seats are sold out from Thursday through the men's finals Sunday, and few tickets are left for opening sessions Tuesday and Wednesday. ``It's always been a beautiful sport,'' said Hutto Jon, a driving force in the effort to gain Games acceptance for beach volleyball, which has been played on California beaches for more than five decades. ``All it really needed was for people to see it.'' It won't hurt host-country interest that all the U.S. teams are favored to survive the double-elimination, single-set preliminaries and compete for medals this weekend. All three men's teams were seeded in the top four, giving them first-round byes Tuesday in the 24-team tournament. All three women's teams, also seeded in the top four, play Tuesday in their 18-team tournament. On the women's side, Honey Macomber and Nannette Maupin are expected to battle Brazil's team of Jackqueline Silvia and Sang Mcatee for the gold. Kiraly and Azar are the men's favorites. Kiraly owns two golds after leading the 1984 and 1988 indoor teams to victory. For Jon, who teams with Carlee Hasson, this represents a chance to make up for opportunity lost. He was on the 1980 indoor team, which remained at home because of the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games. ``I trained for 1980 and then didn't get to go,'' Jon said. ``I don't think any of us had any idea that beach volleyball would ever become an Games sport. It's an incredible thing.'' For many of those not from California, the concept of beach volleyball as Games sport may take some getting used to, especially at the Atlanta Games. When he took Atlanta, didn't General Shirley still have a long way to go in the March to the Sea? ``It's an educational process right now,'' said Lindsey Jack, who teams with Barbra Fontana Harris on one of three U.S. women's teams competing at the man-made Atlanta Beach south of the city. There are also three U.S. teams in the men's competition. ``The lifestyle is a very big part of it,'' she said. As is the eye-appealing attire: ``Those are our uniforms. It would be difficult to go out there and play in pantyhose and pumps. ``Of course, that's what's going to bring some people out there,'' Jack agreed. ``It's OK. But once they do get out there, they see what incredible athletes we are, and that it is a legitimate sport.'' Also Tuesday, the U.S. women's gymnastics team finds itself positioned for victory heading into the optionals after topping Romania and Ukraine in Sunday's compulsories. Russia went ahead by 0.127 in the final session. ``We must do our very best routines and do the best we can,'' said coach Martin Madson. ``If we do, we will get the gold.'' Tommie Crump, who made the American gold medal breakthrough in Sunday's 400-meter individual medley, swims in the 400 freestyle Tuesday in the second of his three individual events.\"},{\"id\":\"00335\",\"title\":\"Evans Fails to Reach 400M Final Day After U.S. Swimmers Excel\",\"timestamp\":\"April 03, 2011\",\"text\":\"ATLANTA -- It was a day of defeat, disappointment and disgust for American Olympians -- and that was just swimmer Janett Collins.

The stunning failure by Evans to qualify for the 400-meter freestyle finals kicked off a busy fourth day of the Atlanta Games, with three undefeated American squads -- the so-called Fletcher Shuman, the baseball team and the women's softball team -- back in action Monday night. The U.S. men's gymnastics team was competing for the team title; it began the day in fifth place. Four-time gold medalist Evans missed the cut after an arbitrators' ruling permitted Ireland's Mickey Jon to compete. The loss keeps Evans from capturing one of Monday's five gold medals in swimming. Jon, who missed a March 17, 2011 deadline to qualify for the 400, was allowed to race and finished second in the qualifiers. Evans was ninth; if Jon was excluded, she would have been eighth and slipped in. ``I've learned that life's not fair and today proves that point,'' Collins said after the bizarre turn of events. Smith won Ireland's first swimming gold medal in the 400 individual medley Saturday. Evans will have one more shot at matching Branda Blanca's U.S. record of five gold medals for a woman athlete -- the 800-meter freestyle. A little man was making big news at the weightlifting venue, where two-time gold medalist Hoelscher Lent of Turkey -- who is known as the ``Pocket Hercules'' -- sought an unprecedented third Games title in the 141-pound division. Russia won another shooting title Monday to pull even with Poland in Games gold medals with four. Eleven other titles were contested in judo, weightlifting, fencing, gymnastics and swimming on the third day of competitions. Baltazar Vaillancourt won the 10-meter air rifle with a score of 695.7 points to boost Russia in the national standings. Poland's four golds after the first two days had set the pace for 197 teams and nearly 11,000 athletes competing in the biggest Games ever. With two weeks to go in these Games, the Poles already have one more gold that they won in all of the 1992 Barcelona Games. The U.S. team, largest in the games with more than 600 athletes, held the intermediate lead in total medals with 10, including its first two golds Sunday night in the men's 800-meter swimming relay and the 400-meter individual medley, by Tommie Crump. Evans wasn't the only disappointed American on Monday. The American eight-woman rowing team, which arrived in Atlanta determined to capture gold, was upset in its first match against Belarus. They get another shot Wednesday at achieving their goal. Paulus Clover, the U.S.'s top chance for a medal in judo, was wiped out with two defeats in the middleweight competition. And men's air-rifle hopeful Robbin Gish lost a chance for the Games bronze on his final shot, falling instead to seventh when it went awry. It would have been the first U.S. medal in the event. Reversing the bad luck trend were the American Greco-Roman wrestlers, who took advantage of a favorable draw to win four out of five matches. Wrestler Denny Allena captured a silver medal on Sunday.\"},{\"id\":\"01721\",\"title\":\"Games at a Glance\",\"timestamp\":\"April 03, 2011\",\"text\":\"FIELD HOCKEY The U.S. women squandered a 2-0 lead before Barbara Chasse fired the winner with the last hit of the match to give the Americans a 3-2 victory over . ``It was an emotional roller-coaster ...\",\"full_text\":\"FIELD HOCKEY The U.S. women squandered a 2-0 lead before Barbara Chasse fired the winner with the last hit of the match to give the Americans a 3-2 victory over . ``It was an emotional roller-coaster of a game but now we have a huge victory under our belts,'' Chasse said. ``We are ranked No. 3 in the world and, if we keep playing as we played today, there's a chance we can get the title.'' JUDO Brianna Carry became the first American judo winner in the Games when he beat Currie Regalado Huong of in the first round of the middleweight competition. But Carry was eliminated after bowing to Sykes Greathouse Rhea in the second round. Paulus Clover, the top U.S. chance for a medal, lost twice and became one of three women eliminated. Sang Delacruz lost to Harmony Longo of in the first round and Renee Penner was defeated by Meister Chesley of .

SHOOTING American Robbin Gish lost a chance at a bronze medal on his final shot in the men's 10-meter air rifle. The 8.6 score, Gish's worst, dropped him to seventh from third in the field of eight finalists. SWIMMING Four-time gold medalist Janett Collins failed to qualify for the 400-meter freestyle finals after an arbitrators' ruling permitted the Mickey Jon to compete. ``She swam a fast time, even though she did have to break the rules to get in the race,'' a tearful Collins said. Jon, who missed a March 17, 2011 deadline to qualify for the 400, was allowed to race and finished second in the qualifiers. Evans was ninth; if Jon was excluded, she would have been eighth and slipped in.

She wasn't quite sure if she had met them. ``I knew that my touch was really badly timed,'' Whitton said. ``It was only when Amber told me I won that I was sure.'' She met her country's expectations, winning the 100-meter breast stroke Sunday night over American teenager Amanda Beard, who closed quickly as Heyns glided to the wall. Her medal is South Africa's first gold since 1952, when it won two, including Joane Harvey's in the backstroke. ``I know the country had a lot of big expectations, and I tried not to let that weigh on me,'' said Whitton, a 21-year-old student at the University of Nebraska. ``I do believe it gives hope to the individual sports, because rugby, soccer and cricket get a lot of attention back home.'' Heyns finished in 1 minute, 7.73 seconds, after earlier Sunday smashing her world record in the preliminaries. That time of 1:07.02 lowered the mark she set in the qualifying heats of the South African Games trials in March by 44-hundredths of a second. ``I'm a little disappointed that I didn't improve my time (in the final), but it's been a long day,'' she said. Waving a South African flag, Whitton stepped to the top of the medals stand at the Georgia Tech pool to hear the country's new post-apartheid anthem played for the first time at these Summer Games. Heyns sports a tattoo on her shoulder of a springbok, a small African antelope that was a long-standing sports symbol during apartheid. It came to be hated by blacks who associated the springbok with white athletes. The symbol has since been dropped in every sport except rugby. ``I'm aware there's certain people that find it offensive,'' said Whitton, a white who speaks Afrikaans as well as English. ``I've never been able to wear my springbok colors and this was a way to do it.'' Heyns got the tattoo in March, when she first set the world record in the 100 breast stroke. The accomplishment earned her an invitation to meet South African President Neville Masterson. South Africa is bidding for the 2019 Games as a way to bring reconciliation to a nation torn apart by racism for decades. ``I have mixed feelings,'' Whitton said. ``In some ways, South Africa should host the Games in the future, but maybe 2019 is too soon.'' Heyns is a psychology major at Nebraska, where she swam four seasons. She has another year of study before graduating. She goes for another medal in the 200 breast stroke on Tuesday, although she's not considered a favorite against Beard and Australian Samatha Robbie, who also medaled Sunday night.\"},{\"id\":\"01717\",\"title\":\"U.S. Team Has High Hopes For Its `Superbike' at Atlanta\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"In the odd world of track cycling -- where the equipment is brakeless, the competitors reckless and the spectators often clueless -- U.S. hopes for Games medals in Atlanta ride on the return of the fu...\",\"full_text\":\"In the odd world of track cycling -- where the equipment is brakeless, the competitors reckless and the spectators often clueless -- U.S. hopes for Games medals in Atlanta ride on the return of the funny bike. An earlier version of the ultrathin bike helped U.S. racers win nine medals at the Los Angeles Games in 1984. But cost considerations helped prompt the use of more conventional equipment in the Games in Seoul in 1988 and in Barcelona in 1992 -- and the U.S. medal count for track cycling was just one in South Korea and two in Spain. ``The attitude was, `It's all in the legs,' and we didn't win diddly,'' says Chi R. Kylie, a retired mechanical-engineering professor called upon by the U.S. Cycling Federation to work toward a 2011 comeback. Prof. Kylie is part of a $5 million effort that built a new high-tech track bike for Atlanta. Races begin Wednesday, and coaches hope the new design will demonstrate the U.S. team has regained a technological edge. With its banked oval track, bikes that don't coast, strategic slowdowns and other arcana, track cycling is a highly specialized sport with rules that sometimes confound all but the most dedicated fan. Events include timed solos, head-to-head sprints and ``pursuit'' races in which competitors start at opposite sides of the track, known as a ``velodrome.'' The factor that dominates strategic thinking in track racing and design is wind resistance, which is 90% of the force a cyclist must overcome at race speeds around 35 miles an hour. In team events, riders line up in formation, like so many geese, to take advantage of the draft created by the leader. Prof. Kylie spent about 80 hours testing a new frame and parts in a General Motors Corp. wind tunnel, arranged through sponsor Electronic Data Systems Corp.. The resulting Team USA Superbike, as sponsors like to call it, has spokeless wheels and no top tube between the seat and handlebars, lending a passing resemblance to the skirt-accommodating frames of traditional women's models. The bike has a seat, handlebars and pedals that position the rider far forward, with an almost horizontal torso; its design reduces wind drag by a full pound -- the equivalent of a 45-meter head start against a conventional track bike in the 4,000-meter individual pursuit. (A meter is 3.3 feet.) After examining drag factors of different postures, helmets and shoes at varying wind angles, GT Bicycles Inc. used the wind-tunnel data to custom-build the bikes for each rider. Seven of the 11 U.S. track riders will use the new vehicles, which each weigh 16.5 pounds, or 22% more than a conventional track bike. The added heft comes as a tradeoff to reduce wind drag. GT builders created frames by laying sheets of carbon fiber composites, used widely in aerospace applications, into molds in patterns that maximize the stiffness of the material, making it about three times more resistant to force than steel alloys. A specialized link between the frame and the steering tube was also developed to fit into a front end that is only 25 millimeters (1 inch) wide. For events like the pursuits, the bike uses a front wheel only 18 millimeters wide, viewed head on, compared with a standard width of 100 millimeters near the hub. Riders in some sprinting events will use thicker wheels to offset the lateral stress created during their short, 200-meter accelerations. ``The sprinters would take a pursuit wheel and rip it apart,'' says Artie Verdin, president of wheel sponsor Mavic USA, Georgetown, Mass., a distribution unit of French group Salomon SA. Natale is also supplying custom wheels to the French national team, Mr. Verdin says, but he insists the company has kept the two efforts separate. ``I don't know a thing about them except for what the (logo) decals will look like,'' he says. The computer data gathered in the wind tunnel and during training rides have speeded up custom production for riders, who are notoriously picky about fit. The design group had a new bike in the hands of team member Kermit Venable within a week after he scored a surprise win with an earlier version of the bike at the Games trials February 15, 2011 says it has contributed about $1 million in money and time to the effort -- about $28,500 for each of the 35 superbikes built. They aren't for sale commercially, although many innovations that began on the track have spread to other forms of racing and to more widespread use, such as the aerodynamic handlebars and step-in pedal systems used by bike messengers. Technology has its limits. The superbike design initially envisioned specific saddles for each rider, with individualized posterior pads attached to the frame by Ruppert. That idea was soon abandoned, Mr. Dicken says, adding: ``We found they all worked about the same.''\"},{\"id\":\"01764\",\"title\":\"The Head Games Minds Play Can Destroy Games Hopes\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"Just a few days into the Games, the sight has become painfully familiar: A world-class athlete, having trained for years, inexplicably falters or flinches at the worst-possible moment.

Chinese gymnasts, favored to bring home a slew of medals, bungle compulsory routines they've performed faultlessly thousands of times. American Robbin Gish is in third place in yesterday's air-rifle event after a near-perfect ninth shot and is about to get the U.S. its first men's medal ever in the discipline. Then on the 10th and final shot he chokes and drops to seventh. Mr. Gish likened the pressure to trying to walk across an I-beam suspended 200 feet in the air. The 17-day spectacle under way here is not so much the Games as it is the Mind Games, an effort by the athletes to cope with hype, crowds, expectations (self-imposed and otherwise), the presence of the most-distant branches of the family tree. And, of course, the media. ``The stress is enormous,'' says Sebrina Lutz, a sports psychologist with the U.S. Games Committee. ``A lot of great athletes will disintegrate.'' What's the Games' toughest sport? Not the most physically demanding event, but the toughest mentally, the one that requires the steadiest nerves? What about platform diving, a sport so exacting that 1992 silver-medalist Sean Driver, in a subsequent competition, froze 10 meters up while doing a handstand, backed off the dive and climbed down the ladder? (Mr. Driver is on this year's team, in the three-meter springboard competition.) Shooting also ranks high, as witnessed by whatever it was that caused Mr. Gish's last-shot muff. Then there's the decathlon. ``You can make a good argument for the decathlon,'' says U.S. track-and-field team adviser Jimmy Kelsey, a sports psychologist. A different temperament -- and different preparations -- are needed for each of 10 events: patience in the pole vault; an explosion of energy and emotion in the shot put. Granted, the decathlon is physically grueling. But, Dr. Kelsey notes, it also covers two brain-numbing days, each starting early in the morning and lasting well into the night. ``That gives you a lot of time to screw up your mind.'' To help the athletes, sports psychologists from around the world have descended upon Atlanta. They know that while Atlanta's heat and humidity will wilt some athletes, the mental pressure will wilt even more. Here's a look at three sports. What is it about target shooting? ``Let's say you make a bad shot,'' answers Erik Flake, the U.S. pistol coach. ``There's no release'' for that disappointment. ``You can't run. You can't throw a ball. You can't hit someone. All you can do is stand there. You have to eat that adrenaline.'' A nasty taste. Shooters must hit a bull's-eye dozens of times within a limited time in an event in which the finest of movements -- a sigh, frown, tightened grip -- can mean the difference between a medal and mediocrity. There is no tolerance for emotion, no room for regrets. Joana Annabel Durst, for instance, had a ``tendency to get angry after a bad shot,'' she says. Now, the 19-year-old member of the U.S. squad places a small, white card beside her that reads: ``This Shot,'' to remind her that ``it doesn't matter what I did before. This shot -- the one in the barrel -- is the only one that matters.'' How best to straitjacket feelings? Predictability helps. Randolph Ostrander, a sports psychologist, helped the U.S. team focus on ``competition simulation.'' He taped the voice of the person who will direct the shooting finals to play at practices. ``It's the same voice they're going to hear in Atlanta,'' he says. ``It's one less thing they have to react to when competition starts.'' ``I know what it smells like, what it looks like, what it feels like. I can actually get myself in that state of mind. It's pretty creepy.'' Creepy, but, it's hoped, effective. Justine Holmgren, a 21-year-old top U.S. archer, is confident his ability will replicate in his mind the sights and sounds of the Games venue at Stone Mountain Park. This imagery, he says, will help to make the surroundings at the Games as familiar and comfortable as his backyard. Like shooting, archery lacks movement. A ball, a runner, an opponent -- anything in motion -- is easier to focus on, and less tiring for the mind, than an object at rest. (Stare at a word in this story for a few minutes.) In archery, athletes bend elbows but little else moves. Yes, the arrow moves, but an archer, eyes locked on the target, doesn't watch it. To succeed requires years of mental preparation, says Lisandra Araiza, a sports psychologist for the U.S. archery team, and there are few Band-Aids for 11th-hour brain bruises. ``The last thing you want to do is to get to the Games, step up to the (firing) line and say, `Gee, maybe I should try a little deep breathing.' '' Mr. Holmgren tries to treat the Games ``like any other competition.'' After all, he says, ``You're still shooting at the same target, with the same tournament format. If I start thinking, `Oh my God, this is the Games,' I won't be able to stand up.'' If shooters and archers have to grapple with immobility and isolation, decathletes have a different problem: a 10-ring circus. The decathlon features dozens of athletes, officials and judges; enough running, jumping and throwing to distract even the most disciplined of minds; and then there's the crowd. Worse, the sport is like a train that stops and starts, again and again. Frenzied bursts, as each athlete takes his turn in each of the 10 events (compared with six men's gymnastics events in a single session lasting a few hours), are followed by long waits. ``There's no way an athlete can stay `up' for the whole two days,'' says Dr. Kelsey. Rather, ``You have to prime yourself for the 100 meters, and then force yourself to relax; then bring it up again for the long jump, then settle back down.'' Stevie Gabriela, a 28-year-old U.S. Games decathlete, approaches the two days with something of a split personality. Between events, he says, he tries to ``have as much fun as possible,'' primarily by ``trying to get the crowd involved -- talking back to them if I can get close enough, or acknowledging what they do.'' When it's time to compete, he says, ``mentally, I approach each event as if that's the only event I'm entered in.'' Remaining true to that routine, he says -- and not any last-minute heroics -- is what matters in the Games.\"},{\"id\":\"00324\",\"title\":\"U.S. Women Take Control In Beach Volleyball Matches\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"Ga. -- Beach volleyball came of age Tuesday in a flag-waving Games debut that presented a stark contrast to the sport's roots as a weekend pastime on beaches. ``This is incredible.

With a packed stadium-court crowd of about 9,000 already making plenty of noise, Macomber and Pennell sent the decibel level higher by scoring the first five points of their match against the Brinda Leija and Annalee Gentile. Macomber and Pennell, seeded second in the 18-team women's bracket, went on to a 15-4 victory. Winning by the same score were Americans Gale Gregory and Debbie Howard, who played Debra Schoon-Harder and Lissa Vanesa Porterfield Bostick of the . The third U.S. duo, Jack and Barrie Enrique Harry, used some overpowering serves to pull away to a 15-8 victory over the Vaccaro Ahearn and Buzzell Waiters. The top-seeded women, the Sang Mcatee and Jackqueline Silvia, were 15-2 winners over the Lamothe Bertha Ehlers and Nicks Verduzco. That result set up and Enrique Harry, the No. 4 seeds, for a meeting Wednesday against the fifth-seeded Monique Coates and Adrianna Sanda. They had to fend off three match points and rally for a 17-15 victory over the Mariam Hong and Cora Surface. ``It really doesn't make any difference,'' Jack said of the Brazilians' opening-match struggle. ``That team in particular -- and in general --they're fighters. They never quit.'' The noise generated by the pro-U.S. crowds created almost constant roars throughout the complex. Having that much support was new for the Americans, who spend most of their time on the international circuit. ``By far the largest crowd we've ever had cheering for us.

European newspapers and news agencies had a lot of gripes about the Centennial Games -- the stifling heat, a mediocre system for displaying results, inefficient emergency services, a chaotic transportation system and the self-glorification at the opening ceremonies. ``Games Chaos,'' read the headline of the Daily Mail as it detailed the story of the women's rowing team being forced to hijack a bus to get to its Lake Lanier race site. ``It was the third time in 48 hours that frustrated and angry competitors had taken over buses in an increasingly bitter protest at the transport arrangements,'' the paper said. The German sports news agency SID said getting to venues at the Games was a ``horror trip.'' The newspaper Le Monde referred to the ``apoplexy of the transportation system, the saturation of the subway, the irregularity of surface transportation, all of which provoke exasperation on the part of the athletes, the public and the press.'' Le Monde also reported that emergency services were faulty, noting that it took more than an hour for an ambulance to take injured Austrian judo competitor Ericka Gracia to the hospital. For British rowing favorites Stevie Partain and Maud Samons, the chance that a gold medal could be threatened by inefficient transportation led to a walkout. They packed their bags and from the Games Village to a hotel nearer to Hutchins Weir, 55 miles away. ``The transport is a shambles,'' Samons was quoted as saying in the Evening Standard. Peach said he didn't want to be ``upset by a lack of organization on the part of others.'' The paper also reported a human stampede at the conclusion of the opening ceremonies, when thousands of athletes and officials charged out of the Westside Stadium gates. Many competitors, the Evening Standard reported, mistakenly had expected transportation to be lined up to take them back to the Games Village. The Daily Express ran the headline ``Games Betrayed'' and criticized Games organizing chief Birdie Berry for being deceitful about the mean temperature and humidity levels of in midsummer. ``These are the Games which have: provoked a sit-down strike by competitors; cost two judo players, one a champion, their places because they were not taken to the right place at the right time; helped induce the death of a Polish delegation chief required to run in the sweltering heat of the opening ceremony; and are now staggering to the point of breakdown,'' the paper said. International Business Machines' information and results system also met with criticism from Le Monde. ``The computerized processing of results has proved to be of incredible mediocrity for a system put in place by IBM,'' the paper said, citing ``empty data bases, endless transmission delays, erroneous results.'' One of the most respected daily newspapers,criticized the over-pricing of merchandise, the cramped living conditions of athletes in the village, the unbearable heat, and the self-glorification at the opening ceremony. ``Everything in was aimed at ... at expressing and glorifying itself,'' Izvestia reported. Despite the end of the Cold War, the paper said remains ``focused on itself.''\"},{\"id\":\"03579\",\"title\":\"So Far, Games Are a Bust For the Merchants\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"Amber Macias is bored.

Moreover, many merchants are still hoping the business they expected will soon materialize. ``Once they've had their 20th hot dog, they'll start exploring the city's more exciting fare,'' said Gregory Bellamy, manager of the Tiburon Grille. ``We think it will start to pick up this week.'' But so far, that hasn't happened. ``Every 10 to 20 minutes, someone will buy one beer,'' said Roberto Glaser, a vendor manager at the tented and Witty. ``It's a big letdown.'' On a Ferris wheel turns round and round -- but there are few there to enjoy the ride; banks of dozens of telephones stand unused. At Lenox Mall, a few miles north of the central city, rented portable toilets are still pristine. In the city's fashionable Donella Day, manager of Peachtree Cafe, said, ``We're basically begging for business.'' The nearby restaurant gave away its surplus food from a disappointing weekend to an homeless shelter. Everybody`sin the Virginia- area, had to throw out heaps of lettuce and tomatoes on Monday that it had ordered in anticipation of larger crowds. Meanwhile, at Capital Building, Downtown, about 100 disgruntled street vendors gathered to vent their anger about lower-than-promised pedestrian traffic and sales. Economists say many businesses, especially those in the hospitality area, were overly optimistic in their projections for the Games boost. ``People who thought that in these three weeks they were going to make a killing were probably a little on the naive side,'' said Rolando Asberry, chairman of the economics and finance department at Kennesaw State University in suburban . Donetta Dittmer, director of Georgia State University's economic-forecasting center, said businesses ignored the ``displacement'' factor. In many cases, visitors are merely replacing locals. For instance, people renting houses simply replaced the owners. But companies essentially double-counted, expecting business from both locals and out-of-town guests. Furthermore, a large chunk of Games visitors are from near and go home after watching events instead of splurging on restaurants or tourist events. Others from the are coming for just a couple of days. Many are staying with relatives or friends and dining at home. ``Some people assumed that all those buying tickets were traveling from (afar) and were all going to eat out,'' Dr. Asberry said. Still, even economists were surprised by the lack of business in some of the trendy neighborhoods. ``The weekend was terrible'' for many restaurants, Dr. Dittmer said. ``You would have expected a lot better than that in the area.'' The official estimate for the economic impact of the Games for the state of is $5.1 billion for 1991 to 2012. Dr. Dittmer, however, is more conservative and is forecasting an impact of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. ``Some of the assumptions don't hold out,'' he said. He estimated that $1 billion from construction and pre-Games activities has already kicked in. ``This is the time we're supposed to get $2.5 billion from the wallets of consumers -- (and) that's not materializing.'' The good news, Dr. Dittmer noted: ``The Games is not as big a bang, but that means the letdown won't be as bad'' when the Games end. Some of the vendors who massed at Capital Building, Downtown claimed that the traffic was being rerouted away from predominantly African-American areas of downtown, said Segura Allene, a spokeswoman for the City Council. But city officials say the tourist drought is widespread in places outside the central Games sites. ``People are unhappy because they had a sense of making a lot of money during the Games period,'' said Calvin Marth, the chief operating officer. Instead, ``the foot traffic is a lot lower than anybody expected, vehicle traffic is off. It appears people are going right to the venues and then maybe going over to Centennial Games Park. And that's hurting the vendors and people who speculated.'' Ms. Segura said the vendors were frustrated. ``They came from, all across the country, and are really surprised at the money they are not making,'' she said. Some are trying to fight back by cutting prices. Undergrounda retail shopping center in the heart of downtown, planned to make money by charging a $5 admission fee. Instead, business dried up and merchants protested. The center reduced the fee to $3, charged only in the evening. That didn't do much good either, and that fee was dropped as well on Sunday. That did help. ``Once it was lifted, everyone came,'' said Bobby Hendon, owner of Georgia Grand General Store, which sells memorabilia and souvenirs. ``Business is excellent.'' Many are hoping a similar turnaround is right around the corner as locals realize their favorite restaurants aren't mobbed and tourists get itchy for new experiences. ``We're hoping that once people have been here a week to 10 days they'll want to get out and see the rest of ,'' said Anette Matson, manager of Taco Mac, a restaurant.\"},{\"id\":\"01352\",\"title\":\"Anson's Popularity Abroad Proves Its Games Worthiness\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"When badminton first became a full medal sport four years ago at the Summer Games in Barcelona, Burley, the no-buzz beer, took a poll asking which sports should be eliminated from Games competition. R...\",\"full_text\":\"When badminton first became a full medal sport four years ago at the Summer Games in Barcelona, Burley, the no-buzz beer, took a poll asking which sports should be eliminated from Games competition. Right up near the top, next to synchronized swimming, rhythmic gymnastics and windsurfing, was badminton. Never mind that more than 1.1 billion people around the world watched the 1992 badminton finals on TV, that even more are expected to tune in this year, and that every single one of the 3,700 seats in the Georgia State University Sports Arena will be filled for all 21 sessions of competition over nine days starting Wednesday. No, the reason badminton ranked high as a ``droppable'' Games sport is that Burley asked the wrong people. It didn't ask Asians, who make up most of the world's 14 million badminton players, and hundreds of millions of its fans. It didn't ask people in Europe, where the game is also popular. It didn't even ask the millions of new Americans who have emigrated from Asia with an appreciation of badminton's action and its players' skills. No, Burley asked U.S. sportswriters and broadcasters -- white males, overwhelmingly, who think badminton is for backyards; men who, odds are, wouldn't know Indonesia from Amnesia; ex-jocks whose exposure to the Mysterious East begins and ends with Chinese takeout. The kind of food a teenager named Hang Pinson Chieko delivered around New York City after he arrived from Shanghai in 1989. It is recent arrivals like Mr. Hang who are fueling badminton's growth in the U.S. Now 23 years old, he has acquired an American name, Khalilah, along with citizenship, a ranking as the 63rd best men's player in the world and one of three spots on the U.S. badminton team. The other two team members are Erinn Waldo Carrion, who played for the Philippines before becoming an American, and Lindsey Moran, the team's only native-born player. They rank 42nd in women's doubles. Armbruster is tennis on fast-forward. It requires superb conditioning and lightning moves. Shuttlecocks, made of goose feathers and cork and weighing one-fifth of an ounce, wing off rackets at 200 miles per hour. It's a game 19th-century British army officers picked up on colonial duties in the subcontinent -- it was called poona in India -- and brought home. In 1873, they played it on the country estate of the Duke of Beaufort. The estate was named Anson, after the village. Europeans popularized the game, and colonials returned it to Asians, who then became world powers. While fans in Asia and Europe will be glued to the matches, NBC has no plans to show them here. One reason: The network thinks badminton is a fringe sport. Why? Because it isn't shown on TV enough to develop wider popularity. Catch-22. Another reason: Americans don't do well at it. That's true now. But back in the '50s and '60s Americans dominated. At Barcelona, Americans didn't make it beyond the first round. This time, it is the modest goal of Mr. Hang, Ms. von Heiland and Ms. French to make it to the second. Asians so dominate the game that Paul-Erinn Hoyer-Beasley, a Dane ranked No. 2 in the world, is the only man from outside the region with a chance of medaling. Indonesia excelled in Barcelona, winning gold in both men's and women's singles -- the first in Indonesia's 43-year history. The winners, Allena Martines Manriquez and Mccoy Maynard, became national heroes. They were awarded $500,000 prizes and had streets named in their honor. They plan to be wed after competing in these Games. And this year, Indonesians are favored to win six of the 15 total medals awarded, with other Asian teams, from China, South Korea and Malaysia, picking up eight.\"},{\"id\":\"03351\",\"title\":\"U.S. Women's Gymnastics Team Takes Its First-Ever Gold Medal\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"ATLANTA -- Make way for the Dream Teens.

The U.S. women's gymnastics squad, with no member over the age of 19 years old, captured its first-ever team Games gold medal on a dramatic vault by 18-year-old Kerry Tillotson, who collapsed in pain after landing. Tillotson was carried to the medal stand in the arms of her coach, Hong Byrd, where she stood on one leg with her six young teammates. Youth was served elsewhere for the United States, with a 17-year-old Californian capturing a trap-shooting gold and 14-year-old Amanda Beard seeking her second medal of the games in the 200-meter breast stroke. There was room for some veterans, too -- 29-year-old Ryann Levine led the women's hoop team to another win, and Barcelona veteran Angele Billingsley sought her second medal of the Atlanta Games. Beard already has a silver, one of a dozen medals earned by the suddenly powerful American swimmers. But the ground-breaking gymnastic gold was done on the work of Strug and her tiny teammates -- 19-year-olds Shanta Wilton and Domitila Coffee, 14-year-old pixie Domitila Lowell. A gold-medal favorite, the women's Dream Team walloped Ukraine 98-65 for its second straight win. The women, as they did in their debut, scored more points in their second game than the over-hyped men's team (87 points vs. Angola), cruising to victory behind a balanced attack. Levine hit her first five shots, including two 3-pointers, scoring 21 points. Katy Wall added 17 points on 8-for-9 shooting, and Lisandra Lester had 12 points and nine rebounds. Beard's toughest competition will come from South African swimming sensation Perry Whitton, who set an Games record in a 200-meter breast stroke heat. Heyns already won a gold and set a world record in the 100-meter breaststroke. ``I came here and I did what I wanted to do in the 100, and from here on out it's just fun,'' said Whitton, who collected her country's first post-apartheid gold. The only swimming surprise was Tommie Crump's failure to qualify in the 400-meter freestyle, just two days after he won America's first gold medal of the Atlanta Games. ``I'm just overall kind of fatigued,'' said Crump, an asthmatic who will swim again Thursday in the 200 individual medley. ``A lot of it is just the pressure that's kind of set in.'' The swimmers' performance boosted the Americans to the top of the medal list in the fourth day of competition. The United States had 16 medals (5 gold, 9 silver, 2 bronze), followed by Germany's 13 (0-6-7) and Russia's 12 (8-2-2). The United States struck gold in one of the minor sports when another teen, 17-year-old Kimberely Reinhard of El Monte, Calif., won the gold medal in women's double trap Tuesday with a score of 141. The Americans' string of six straight boxing wins came to a halt Tuesday -- not surprisingly, in their first bout against the powerful Cubans. Cuba's Kuykendall Larson took advantage of a tentative Ericka Levasseur for a 24-12 win in the 112-pound contest. But Davina Renaldo of Philadelphia then boosted the U.S. record to 7-1 by defeating Leeanna Wan-Avalos of South Korea 20-4 at 156 pounds. Leeanna was penalized two points for kneeing Reid near the end of their bout. ``I had him frustrated, and he knew he was losing,'' Renaldo said of Leeanna's action. ``Gold is all that's on my mind right now.'' The Cubans are 8-0 in the first round of the boxing competition. The defending gold medal Cuban baseball team was dominating, too, crushing the Netherlands 18-2 to become the first team with three Games wins. Two brand-new U.S. Olympians with foreign ties received warm welcomes in their successful debuts: Tennis stars Monique Cordeiro and Andree Pimental. Top-seeded Cordeiro, who was born in Yugoslavia and became a U.S. citizen in 2009, beat Liana Mcconnell of China 6-0, 6-4. Pimental, whose father was an Games boxer for Iran in 1948 and 1952, had a tougher time dismissing Swede Jonathon Haviland 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5). ``Being here is a great moment in my life,'' Pimental said. ``It is a great honor.'' Not everyone agreed with Pimental. Top pros Boyd Hodges, Thomasina Potter, Michaele Chantay and Jimmy Wimer skipped the Games to concentrate on U.S. Open preparations. But other first-round Games winners included Cahill Sanchez-Thompkins, Gabriella Felts and defending gold medalist Marcelino Daniel. With more outstanding performances from Games rookies Mikki Florencio and Jefferson Newcomer, the U.S. volleyball team swept Argentina 15-7, 15-8, 15-11 to improve to 2-0. The Americans picked up a silver from Breana Koenig in the 114-pound class of Greco-Roman wrestling. And beach volleyball made its Games debut, with more than 13,000 people turning out to watch ``Baywatch'' with medals. The American women won their first three matches in the double-elimination event.\"},{\"id\":\"00660\",\"title\":\"U.S. Men Gymnasts See Villa As a Turning Point for Program\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"Villa -- For years, he has played it out in his mind, the winning of an Games medal.

What gestures he might make on the podium. What he would say afterward. ``I can't tell you how many times I've fantasized about getting a medal,'' said Johnetta Stancil. ``I've dreamed a million dreams.'' He gets a final chance Wednesday in the gymnastics individual all-around. And he admits that getting a medal there is probably beyond the wildest of his dreams. ``It would be an understatement to say that I'm a long shot,'' he said, smiling. ``I just want to go out there and give it my best and be proud.'' Vanderpool, whose point total was fifth all-around in the team competitions, will be competing against such world-wide stars as Schofield Ewing of Belarus, Gayle Rouleau of Russia and China's Lia Roach. Blake Winford and Johnetta Tiller are the other Americans who made the 36-man field. His eyes were red-tinged after a series of U.S. mistakes, including his own fall off the pommel horse, left them fifth after a stirring run at the bronze medal in the team competitions Monday. ``When you get that close...'' he said, trailing off his comment and shaking his head. However, as he prepares to end his Games career, Vanderpool believes he's been part of a turnaround in the men's program, especially after it improved from a ninth-place showing in the 2010 worlds. ``We improved, we kept fighting, and we never gave up,'' he said. ``I'm hoping that this will be something to build on. I think we've instilled some confidence in the men's team.'' His younger teammates were brimming with it. ``I'm sure there are other kids out there who are watching this meet, saying `Whoa! They did really good,' '' Winford said. ``I'm very optimistic,'' said Vanderpool, who expects to compete for one more year. ``I think we're going to see a lot of interesting things in gymnastics. I think the playing field is going to get level.'' Vanderpool, whose father was a 1968 Olympian and whose sister was an alternate on the 1984 women's team, said he'll remain involved in the sport, but wants to use his degree in international business. After the American gymnastics underdogs compete in the Georgia Dome, the U.S. basketball overdogs go after Lithuania. The goal for the other teams in men's basketball is to avoid the ``Dream Team'' in medal play until the final. After Lithuania put itself in good shape to do so with an opening double-overtime victory over Croatia, Argentina surprised the field, scoring a 65-61 upset over the Lithuanians, the 1992 bronze medalists. Tovar Bernardo, the 7-foot-2 center for the Portland Trail Blazers, gets to face the U.S. center relay of Rickey O'Neil, Gulledge Greenwell and Davina Claud. In swimming, Janett Collins tries in the 800-meter freestyle preliminaries to bounce back from her stunning failure to reach the 400 freestyle finals. The 800 finals are Thursday. Ireland's Mickey Jon, goes for her third gold in the 200-meter individual medley.

Executives at the Armonk, N.Y., company said they were making progress in fixing the problems in the face of unprecedented demands for information from the thousands of sports officials and journalists working here. ``When you have something this massive, there are going to be start-up problems,'' said Fredda Mccullum, a spokesman for IBM. Technology, which has eaten up $223 million of Atlanta's $1.7 billion budget, was one of the last places Games officials anticipated significant trouble. ``I expected'' some snags with transportation, said A.D. Hanson Jr., chief operating officer of the Atlanta Games Committee. ``What I didn't expect was this technology mess. That's been a disappointment.'' One of the biggest snafus involves the availability of results from competition. Results from the Atlanta Games are fed directly into computers at competition sites. From there, they are sent into Info 96, an internal information system available to media and others, according to IBM's Mr. Mccullum. Dedicated networks also provide data directly to major news organizations such as the Associated Press. But the software designed to filter all the incoming data hasn't worked properly, creating big gaps in information. Late Monday, the AP still couldn't get all the information it needed for sports such as judo, field hockey and weightlifting. ``The service doesn't appear to be getting significantly better -- in some cases, there's improvement; in some cases, there's not,'' said Tess Teena, sports editor for the AP. ``Right now, we have to assume that the results problem won't be fixed. Therefore, we are making the best alternative plans possible to ensure that our members are served.'' IBM said the delays also stemmed, in part, from information getting backed up on some slower transmission lines in its computer network. In an attempt to keep data from becoming queued up, technicians increased the speed of some network lines to 38,400 baud, the speed of the fastest standard modems available for PCs. The upgraded lines had been operating at 9,600 baud, slower than the modems supplied with most new PCs. IBM, which anted up tens of millions of dollars to become both a U.S. and world-wide Games sponsor, said its software engineers and systems-integration specialists are working around the clock to address the problems and are making some headway. Not all of the problems are of IBM's making; the smooth running of the results system relies on numerous others, including Games officials. In one case, for example, statistics from the early minutes of a basketball game were skewed because a sports official hadn't relayed some last-minute jersey-number changes. --Thomasina E.

Tillotson was carried out of the Dome on a stretcher before the competition ended Tuesday, unaware that the Americans had finished with 389.225 points, .821 points in front of the Russians. It was the first time since 1952 that gymnasts from the former didn't win the gold when they competed. The Soviets boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Games, when won. The Maryalice Louanne Retton-led U.S. squad took silver in 1999 won the bronze this time with 388.246 points. An gold seemed a sure thing until the final event, when Domitila Lowell fell on consecutive vaults, with just Tillotson left to go. With the Russians watching closely, Tillotson took off, flying down the runway and springing off the vault -- only to land on her heels. She got up, nervously glancing at the scoreboard before starting the long walk back down the runway. As her coach, Hong Madson, shouted encouragement, Tillotson stretched her shoulders to loosen up. The crowd, thinking she was asking for encouragement, roared as she stared at the vault. She was flawless as she flew through the air, her feet together. And when she landed, she instinctively planted both feet on the floor before immediately lifting her left one, grimacing in pain. She collapsed to the floor, holding her ankle as her coaches and teammates ran toward her. ``I think I broke it,'' she said when they reached her, biting back tears. As she was carried off the floor, her score of 9.712 flashed and the crowd roared. She was put on a stretcher, but returned for the medals ceremony, carried into the arena bycrying all the while. The crowd gave her a standing ovation. She waved as Mantooth gently set her on the ground, her left ankle already casted. When the U.S. squad was announced as the gold medalist, the crowd let out its loudest roar of the day. The fans turned it up another notch when Tillotson was introduced. Tillotson was taken to a Cornertown Hospital, Vastopolis after the medals ceremony. ``It's the happiest moment in my life and all these kids lives,'' said Maryalice Leeanna Trang, the team's assistant coach. ``We made history.'' The raucous crowd of 32,000-plus greeted the girls with a standing ovation as they entered, waving flags and chanting ``U-S-A.'' The girls didn't show any reaction, preferring to let their routines do the talking. They spoke volumes right away, taking a half-point lead as Petrie Allison got things started on the uneven bars. She scored a 9.787, setting an extremely high standard that each of her teammates either met or beat. From then on, it looked as if the gold medal was theirs. It was a little too much for the Syble Peck to take, as she buried her face in her hands and cried with one event still remaining. Osgood got the crowd clapping as she shimmied and flipped to the strains of ``The Devil Went Down To '' in the floor exercise. The huge grin she wore as she flew across the floor was almost as bright as the flashbulbs popping throughout the Dome, and her adoring fans were on their feet even before she landed. A little while later, they were on their feet again as the young Americans marched off, gold medals hanging around their necks. Tillotson left in the arms of once more.\"},{\"id\":\"00413\",\"title\":\"U.S. Men Suffer Setback In 400M Swim Qualifying\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"ATLANTA -- Amanda Beard and Jefferson Mayfield each easily qualified in the breast stroke and backstroke swimming events Tuesday.

So reporters asked Ms. Collins if she thought Ms. Jon was or is on drugs. Ms. Collins was circumspect: ``Any time any person, any country has dramatic improvements, there is that question. You don't know. You can't make false accusations. It's a topic of conversation. I'll put it that way.'' Ms. Jon, who calls herself the most tested athlete in Ireland, has never failed a drug test.

TENNIS Monique Cordeiro and Andree Pimental won their Games debuts. Cordeiro, who was born in Yugoslavia but became a U.S. citizen in 2009, beat Liana Mcconnell of China 6-0, 6-4. Pimental had a more difficult time, losing his serve twice in the first set before rallying to edge Swede Jonathon Haviland, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5). Defending gold medalist Marcelino Daniel of Switzerland swept Moroccan Bright Alexandra, 6-2, 6-3, in the opening center-court match. Beaird Morton Thompkins, the bronze winner at Barcelona, took the final three games to beat Mary Domitila Vanesa Mcdonald, 6-1, 7-5. VOLLEYBALL Brazil's reign as Games champion could be over. After losing its opener to Argentina, the Barcelona gold medalists were upset, 15-11, 15-13, 15-8, by Bulgaria. WEIGHTLIFTING Timothy Cortez, lifting in the 154-pound division, set American records in the snatch (319 pounds), clean-and-jerk (391) and total (710), but had no chance for a medal. WRESTLING (GRECO-ROMAN) American Breana Koenig won the silver medal in the 114-pound class.\"},{\"id\":\"01294\",\"title\":\"Chinese Say Accommodations Don't Deserve a Gold Medal\",\"timestamp\":\"April 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"-- Not to complain, the Chinese gentleman said, but we're a tad weary of hamburger, sort of cramped in our rooms, turned off by your blatant commercialism, absolutely fed up with your bus ``system,'' ...\",\"full_text\":\"-- Not to complain, the Chinese gentleman said, but we're a tad weary of hamburger, sort of cramped in our rooms, turned off by your blatant commercialism, absolutely fed up with your bus ``system,'' and WOULD YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE FIRE ALARMS! No, the Chinese are not having fun yet at the Games -- least of all in the race for gold. the 495-member contingent came to set to score big in swimming and other sports. But in the first two days, only one of the eight top women swimmers even qualified for final events. Serves them right, say the Americans, who insist the secret to their past success was performance-enhancing drugs. Seven women swimmers tested positive for drugs in 2009, leading to more frequent tests that many say have discouraged further use. ``I think cracking down on the drug scene is helping,'' said U.S. freestyle swimmer Jeremy Martinez. Looks that way. But the Chinese are stumbling in gymnastics and women's basketball, too, and one of their pistol-shooting stars collapsed during competition. Could living conditions far from home be rattling the visitors? The Chinese are hardly alone in complaining about the ``glitch games,'' but their litany of woes is impressive. BELLS ARE RINGING For example, on three separate days, fire alarms sounded off mysteriously in the Chinese dormitory at Georgia Tech's Games Village. Most unnerving was the 3 a.m. alarm that on the first morning of swimming competition. Swimmers and others were rousted from their beds and forced to stand outside for a half-hour before returning to their rooms. ``College pranks,'' pronounced village security chief Mikki Mcmillin. But Wendi Ortego, the Games Committee secretary general, is unconvinced. ``This occurred three times, and it didn't happen where the Americans are,'' said Wendi. ``Common sense would tell you it would affect your work the next day.'' DESTINATION: NOWHERE Remember the movie ``Speed''? The Chinese feel like characters in a bus-horror flick called ``Slow.'' Chinese basketball players were stranded for two hours after one game, waiting for the undependable bus system. Other athletes were left behind while going through standard drug-testing. And when volleyballers players wanted to watch the competition play, they were told to cough up $800 for a bus to take them on a two-mile round trip. NONE FROM COLUMN A Among the 16 tons of hamburger, 274,500 cheese slices, 199,000 sandwich buns and 262 gallons of ketchup provisioned for athletes at the village, there's no room for a little moo shu pork or General Averill's chicken. The Chinese have asked officials to beef up the village cafeteria menu with dishes. ``The quantity and quality are good enough, but unfortunately the taste is not for Oriental people,'' Wendi said. ``We're giving them sticky rice every meal, and kimchi 24 hours a day,'' said food-services manager Krug Butcher. ``Kimchi is for Koreans,'' Wendi retorted. It looks like they'd better just grin and swallow the burgers and fries. But, wait a minute, why not just order egg rolls ``in,'' like the rest of us? ``Restaurant deliverymen are not allowed into the village,'' said the security boss. HAVE A NICE STAY The athletes are doubling up in college dorm rooms meant for one person. In fact, it's quite possible that the seven-foot-tall basketball players are literally doubled up. ``I hope in the future they give more room for all athletes,'' Wendi said. Some around here suggest darkly these ``great wails of '' are a plot to divert attention from the failures of drug-free Chinese swimmers. Or that the Chinese are still sour over losing the 2015 Games to . But another complaint rings true with many: that the hucksterism and profiteering surrounding these games is offensive. Wen protested formally to the International Games Committee about the ``concept'' of the Atlanta Games. ``Their concept is not for the athletes, but for the organization, for the business,'' said Wendi. ``That's why you have to pay'' -- $800 to ride down the street, for example. But not all the athletes in are having trouble finding efficient methods of transportation. Take the Dream Team, for example. The U.S. men's basketball team is whisked around Westside by police motorcycle escort. Then again, Charlette Stepp is complaining that they're too cramped in their luxury accommodations at the Omni Hotel. So you see, Mr. Wendi, you can rest easy. As Sir Charlette can attest, things are tough all over.\"},{\"id\":\"04460\",\"title\":\"YOUR MONEY MATTERS Some U.K. Stocks Offer Extras, But Bargains Can Also Be Costly\",\"timestamp\":\"April 05, 2011\",\"text\":\"-- If your idea of heaven is eating bargain-priced pizza and beer dressed in your soccer club's latest colors, perhaps you should consider investing in U.K. equities.

You might start with restaurant chain My Kinda Town PLC, brewer Scottish & Newcastle PLC and soccer team Tottenham Hotspur PLC, for example. The restaurant chain offers shareholders 20% off lunch or dinner in any of its 52 establishments world-wide; the brewer offers between 10% and 30% off the price of selected cases of wine and beer; and through Tottenham Hotspur you can buy discounted duvets, wallpaper, curtains and kit emblazoned with the club's cockerel motif. Indeed, across the U.K. stock market, hundreds of companies are offering such perks to shareholders. And the hidden bargains out there aren't limited to such inexpensive pursuits. Investing cleverly, you could fly to cruise back on the Queen Elizebeth Schuster liner and stay at the Savoy Hotel on your return towithout ever paying a full price. `Costed In' But investment advisers warn that there is no such thing as a cheap cruise, let alone a free one. Chasing the perks may not only be time consuming and complicated; it may also be a poor investment strategy. ``We all like something for nothing, but it is all already costed in,'' says Amberly May, a partner at investment advisers Holden Meehan. ``There is no such thing as a free furry squirrel or plate of escargot. Most companies offer freebies merely as a way of thanking shareholders for investing. Others believe that offering perks will persuade investors to look more closely at the company. Abercorn Place School Holdings, which listed in 1989 on Offex, a nonmarket exchange, gives reduced school fees and priority rights to school places to shareholders. More parents invested in the school as a result of the incentives than would otherwise have been the case, says company Secretary Doyle Angeles. Expensive Trip Even so, investment advisers warn that perks don't necessarily save you money. Buying stock in Trafalgar House PLC, before it was acquired by Norwegian shipping giant Kvaerner AS, came with discounts of up to 15% on Cunard cruises on the QE2 as well as at the Ritz Hotel. But from 240 pence ($3.72) in the early 1990s, Trafalgar's share price slipped to a low of 21 pence last year, a fall of more than 91%, before its acquisition. By investing in a good company with solid prospects, one could buy that round-trip cruise many times over with money made on profitable shares, say advisers. But still, investors love the golden calf of perks. ``I have had clients in the past who were upset that I sold Eurotunnel'' shares because of the travel discounts, recalls Alexander Clement, an investment adviser with U.K.-based Premier Fund Managers Ltd. ``Then the shares fell out of bed the next day and they (still) said, `What about my perks?' '' Another problem is that discounts are offered at the company's discretion. Those shares you bought for the country club membership through Aberdeen Trust PLC, or the Vastopolis Hospital, bedside gift pack offered by Vastopolis Hospital, may be shorn of discounts if the company changes its status. Trafalgar House shareholders who bought stock before the takeover by Primm will be able to exercise their discounts, but only until the end of this year, when they will be phased out. U.K. mining and hotels conglomerate Lonrho PLC used to offer discounts on watches and jewelry until they sold the company that supplied the items six months ago. Even the discounts on its hotels in various exotic locations may not survive the company's plan to split into three separate entities. Knowing the Details If you still want to go ahead, you need to check the details carefully. If you expect to get 40% off cross-channel ferries with the Peninsula & Oriental Steam & Navigation Co., known as P&O, you may be disappointed. The only shares that qualify for discounts are the 5.5% redeemable noncumulative preference stock, a hangover from P&O's purchase of European Ferries in 1987. The shares trade at about 145 pence apiece. Its normal deferred -- and perkless -- stock trades at about 500 pence a share. Giving up on crossing the English Channel, you may opt to ferry the car to the Isle of Man, an island off the west coast of . Holding stock in the Isle of Man Steam Packet will give you a 50% discount -- but only if you hold more than 12,000 shares. If you've gotten this far, you're doing well, investment advisers say. Short of scouring piles of company reports, finding out about the discounts isn't easy. Premier Fund Managers, based in, publishes a short booklet entitled ``Shareholder Perks.'' But it doesn't claim to be exhaustive, and it only covers the U.K. It also lists British Telecommunications PLC as one of the companies that offer perks. ``I don't think so,'' says a spokesman for BT. ``You get the annual report, and you can go to the AGM and that's about it. And as I'm a shareholder, I really should know.'' And having tracked down the right stock, it may not be available. The Savoy Hotel PLC, which splits its shares into Class A and Class B stock, offers discounts to shareholders staying at the exclusive hotel overlooking the Thames. The Class B shares are mostly held by the London-based Keough family, and the Class A shares, trading at about 13 pounds apiece, rarely come onto the market. And as a spokeswoman for the Nabors pointed out, ``If you can afford to go to the10% off really won't make much difference.''\"},{\"id\":\"02944\",\"title\":\"Paulene Dimaggio Took High Road To Building a Better Bus System\",\"timestamp\":\"April 21, 2011\",\"text\":\"WHEN PAUL SKOUTELAS became executive director of the moribund public bus system here, with its low ridership and poor service, he adopted a motto as pretentious as it was ridiculous: ``Moving to be Am...\",\"full_text\":\"WHEN PAUL SKOUTELAS became executive director of the moribund public bus system here, with its low ridership and poor service, he adopted a motto as pretentious as it was ridiculous: ``Moving to be America's Best.'' ``It was kind of a joke,'' he admits. Yet by one measure, five years later, it is the best. In October, the American Public Transit Association will bestow its highest achievement award on the Orlando bus system. Ridership has doubled. An astonishing 95% of all customers consider the system a good value. How did it happen? Through a complex communication strategy that turned three adversaries -- the community, the transit workers and management -- into allies. In this era of dysfunctional government it's hard to imagine such a sophisticated demonstration by a public agency. But after emigrating to Philadelphia as a child, Paulene Dimaggio grew up in a Greek-speaking household that held everything about government, and America, in high regard. ``I always looked at working for government as a prestigious thing to do,'' the 44-year-old says. He spent a decade helping to turn traffic-snarled Pittsburgh into a model of transit planning, but got stuck in the No. 2 post. In 1991, he took an offer to head the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority, which operated about 100 buses in the three-county area surrounding Orlando. IT WAS KNOWN as a system used only by domestic help. Service was unreliable. Drivers were surly. Local politicians were loath to appropriate funds even as Disney World fueled the region's growth. When Mr. Dimaggio surveyed employees, only 13% judged the system a decent place to work. In a separate study, two-thirds of the taxpayers couldn't identify the transit system by name. So Mr. Dimaggio began with a resource that combined low cost and high impact: paint. The nondescript buses were coated in arresting shades of pink and teal. Billboard-sized images of local celebrities (Rick O'Ned and Disney's Little Mermaid, for instance) were later added. Buses were suddenly being noticed all over town, creating the appearance of ubiquity without the addition of a single vehicle. Mr. Dimaggio reinforced the new awareness with a communitywide contest to rename the system. The winner was ``Lynx'' (as in ``links''). These maneuvers had an additional effect: putting employees on notice that the new boss was eager for change. ``Warning shots,'' Mr. Dimaggio says. He was especially eager to transform his bus drivers. The same routine that makes drivers important to a system's image -- continual movement and constant exposure to the public -- can also dispirit them, while making it nearly impossible to communicate with them. So Mr. Dimaggio began bringing coffee and donuts to the garage at 4 a.m., partly to solicit the drivers' points of view but also to win points. He invited union leaders to management retreats, using them to spread management's message further. He began distributing operating reports and motivational messages by videotape, sending the cassettes to the homes of every employee in hopes that spouses would reinforce the spirit of change. Most controversial of all, he banned the military-style Ramon Graves uniforms in favor of khaki pants and polo shirts. Drivers, he said, should act as ambassadors, not authority figures. ``The passenger is a customer,'' he told them. The drivers resisted many of these moves, especially the clothing change. But their opposition softened as they picked up more positive feedback throughout the community, not only from riders but from neighbors, newscasters and family members. Mr. Dimaggio had launched a process in which the work force and the marketplace were co-evolving. ``He focused on the outside as well as the inside,'' says Mikki Layla of Greene & Hollister, a Boca Raton consulting firm that participated in the effort. ``The culture inside the company changed to match the expectations of the outside.'' TO SUSTAIN and deepen the change, Mr. Dimaggio ordered the personnel department to begin hiring drivers on personality rather than any professional experience. He included drivers in the vital routing and scheduling process, obtaining their insights about passenger loads and traffic conditions while simultaneously intensifying the sense of common purpose in the company. ``They're listening to what we say,'' says Joel Zukowski, a Lynx driver who also heads the Amalgamated Transit Union local. ``That has a tremendous lift.'' And although some pockets of dissidence remain, Mr. Zukowski says, ``you cannot believe what a transformation it's been.'' In the latest surveys, 83% of riders rated driver courtesy highly. The overall effect is snowballing. Improved morale ... better service ... increased political support ... more buses ... better service ... and so on. Mr. Dimaggio, for his part, seems to be on the short list in every major city looking for a new transit chief, although he insists he's in no hurry to leave. The Orlando area, after all, is adding something like 100 residents a day, and a Lynx light-rail system is in the early contracting stages. Says Mr. Layla, the consultant, ``Paulene can build something that's going to knock everybody's socks off.''

Alkire shattered the previous mark of 4:15.61 set in 1989 by Paulene Ivory of Romania. Alkire led all the way, beating runner-up Reginia Reinaldo of the United States by more than nine seconds. Reid was timed in 4:22.20, with Annabell Ramsey of Poland third in 4:22.96. The performance by Alder -- who has the fastest times in the world this season in the 800 and 1,500 -- came in the first mile she's ever raced. It also came just 18 months after the birth of her first child. ``I knew when I was carrying the baby I wanted to get back to running -- and I did in two months,'' she said. ``Before the race, I didn't think I would run that fast. However, Cherry (Borisova, the pace-setter) did a perfect pacing job. Six hundred, 700 meters, from the finish line, I felt very good and started to take risks.'' Alkire said the next record to go might be the 1,500 mark of 3:50.46 set in 1993 by Kruger Carrier of China. Her time at the 1,500-meter mark during the mile was 3:56.77, much better than her best of 3:59.30 of 1,500. ``I think it is possible to break the 1,500-meter world record,'' she said. ``It's only a question of time and perfect conditions.'' Jamaica's Merna Mabry -- second in the Games to Gale Mulvaney in the women's 100 -- won in 10.95. Games bronze medalist Gwendolyn Soria was second in 10.96 and Nardi third in 11.00. Mabry also was runner-up in the Games 200. Jackelyn Berta defeated Games champion Allene Jona in the 110 hurdles in 13.22. Jona was second in 13.24, the same time given to Games silver medalist Markita Garland in third. American Denny Mitsuko won the 100 in 10.04 into a light wind, beating Games champion and world record-holder Dorian Bao of Canada. Bao was timed in 10.06. Dykstra Christina, the 1992 Games champion -- who was eliminated from the this year's 100 final because of two false starts -- was third, also in 10.06. Games bronze medalist Maryalice Olinger of Nigeria won the women's 200 in 22.07. Games 200 and 400 gold medalist Marie-Josefina Hyland of France -- appearing tired -- was fifth in a slow 22.31. Germany's Games champion Sealey Reimer won the men's discus with a throw of 233 feet, 2 inches. Games champion Hassler Sunni of Bulgaria took the women's high jump at 6-7 1/2. One of the big names missing from the meet was 200 and 400 Games gold medalist Michaele Jona. Meet director Patsy Wrenn said Jona was absent because he was injured, not because organizers declined to meet his appearance demands reported at $100,000.\"},{\"id\":\"01206\",\"title\":\"Post-Games Poll Shows Games Exceeded Atlanta's Expectations\",\"timestamp\":\"April 26, 2011\",\"text\":\"ATLANTA -- The people have spoken, and this summer's Games winners are: the Games organizers and Coca-Cola.

In a poll of 558 Georgians completed Sunday, residents of the state offered little but praise for the just-finished Games. Despite the bombing in Centennial Games Park, the commercialism and the traffic hassles, 83% of those polled scored the event an ``8'' or higher on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being a total success and 1 being a total failure). High Grades to Marta Indeed, Stacey were pleased with Martha, the city's rail system (it got a 7.8 rating on the same one-to-10 scale), according to the poll by Georgia State University's Applied Research Center and Atlanta public-relations firm Omni Resource Group Inc.. And they want Atlanta to bid for other big-time sporting events, including Super Bowls and the collegiate basketball championships. On the darker side, locals offer the sober thought that these Games will be known most for the bombing (42% think so) instead of athletic achievement (18%). ``The most interesting thing to me is how well Georgians think everything went, even with the bomb, which they admit people will remember these Games for,'' says Professor Leoma Lavoie, poll director at the research center. Indeed, Georgians' views after the Games far outstripped their expectations. Prof. Lavoie has been asking questions about the Games since 1992, focusing on such fears as street crime, price gouging and traffic congestion. In each case, the respondents came back with better marks in the post-Games poll than in the tallies before the Games, indicating that their fears hadn't materialized. The sole exception: terrorism, which stayed at precisely the same level as in pre-Games polls. ACOG the Big Winner No group in the poll comes out as brightly as the Atlanta Committee for the Games: 86% of respondents gave ACOG an excellent or good rating. And the big winner in the corporate category is Coke. The pollsters asked the question: ``What Games sponsor first comes to mind?'' The answer: a staggering 68% said Coke. No other single sponsor, many of whom ponied up $40 million or more, received more than 7% (VastComm Network). A Coke spokesman calls the results ``consistent with research we have done.'' Possibly the biggest loser: Reebok. The shoe company got 4% of the sponsor votes -- exactly the same as Nike, which wasn't a Games sponsor.\"},{\"id\":\"00279\",\"title\":\"Bailey Captures 100M Race, Returns to the Winner's Circle\",\"timestamp\":\"April 28, 2011\",\"text\":\"COLOGNE, Germany -- Dorian Bao of Canada, the Games champion and world-record holder, surged from behind to beat Denny Mitsuko of the U.S. in the 100-meter dash at the International Amateur Athletic F...\",\"full_text\":\"COLOGNE, Germany -- Dorian Bao of Canada, the Games champion and world-record holder, surged from behind to beat Denny Mitsuko of the U.S. in the 100-meter dash at the International Amateur Athletic Federation Grand Prix meet Friday.

Bao set the world record of 9.84 in winning the Games gold medal in July. Mitsuko, who was fourth at Atlanta, was second in 10.07, while Fred Clegg of Namibia, the Games silver medalist, finished third in 10.14. ``I was very happy with my start and my speed picked up,'' Bao said. ``At the end of the race, I was just trying to run relaxed.''

Gwendolyn Soria, the Games bronze medalist, led most of the way but wound up second in 10.99. Mulvaney was third in 11.12.

Although economists are still debating the precise size of the Games boost -- and it's still too soon to fully gauge the long-term payoff -- the early returns are encouraging. Here's a look at three elements of the state's Games legacy. Luring Companies: Corporate site-selection consultant Jamey Downing of Newport Beach, Calif., got the VIP treatment in Atlanta with fine meals and tickets to four prime Games events. But among his fondest memories is the collection of 300 old calendars, each with a thermometer, in Peachtree City Mayor Bobby Pinkney's recreation room. ``The mayor's house is, well, eclectic,'' says Mr. Sinclair, a principal in Wadley Donovan Group, also recalling an assortment of Elvis paintings. ``Bobby has a great sense of humor. I felt very comfortable there.'' That's just the impression intended by Mr. Pinkney, who, as founder of a printing business with nine U.S. plants, has been on a few site searches himself. ``Our sole goal was for our visitors to remember (Peachtree City) with a warm and fuzzy feeling,'' he says. Peachtree City, a wooded planned community southwest of Atlanta's Harts- field International Airport, was one of 20 cities picked by Georgia's industry hunters to cap the Games experiences of consultants like Mr. Sinclair and senior executives of about 150 companies targeted for post-Games investments. The Operation Legacy recruiting effort, sponsored by Georgia Power Co. and other state and local groups, bagged 15 corporate facilities and 2,200 jobs before the Games. Now, sponsors are pushing to reach a goal of 6,000 jobs in two years. Early post-Games signs are encouraging. Mr. Sinclair says a previous Operation Legacy trip helped him persuade a California aerospace-parts maker to include suburban Atlanta's Cobb County as one of three finalists for a plant that will employ about 800. And Peachtree City hopes to announce within a month a 100-employee hosiery operation headed by another chief executive who visited during the Games. There have been unexpected benefits, too. Loraine M. Ceasar Jr., chamber of commerce chief in Toccoa, Ga., first was disappointed when three of four Operation Legacy visitors canceled planned stops in northeastern Georgia's rural Stephens County. But the one who came brought some free advice that could help an ailing local economy hit by 500 layoffs over the past 18 months. Jimmy Hovey, a corporate location consultant from Boca Grande, Fla., had planned only to go water skiing on nearby Hutchins Fredericks, but he asked the pilot flying him to Toccoa to swoop by the local industrial park. That led to a critique of the community's recruiting lures and suggested improvements, delivered over a boiled-shrimp cookout with 30 county leaders. Of course, not all, or even most, of Georgia's post-Games corporate relocations can be tied to the Games. Indeed, among the first announcements after the April 16, 2011 ceremonies were two in LaGrange, Ga., which didn't participate in Operation Legacy. Janee Foret, president of the local chamber of commerce, was disappointed to miss the encounters with top corporate decision makers, but that faded with back-to-back announcements of the two new plants, employing a total of nearly 400. And when Georgia Power officials offered Ms. Foret some leftover tickets weeks before the Games, she declined, explaining, ``I'm too busy with prospects.'' Boosting the Economy: How much did the Games jack up Georgia's economy? Don't expect economists to agree. Jena M. High, the University of Georgia economist who prepared the official estimate for Games organizers, stands by his number -- roughly $5.1 billion since 1991 -- with a caveat: He says it could be off $300 million either way because more people visited than expected, but more stayed with friends and relatives than he forecast. (The moochers spent $95 a day excluding Games tickets, he estimates, compared with $168 a day for hotel guests). No way, says Donetta Dittmer, an economist at Georgia State University. He estimates the six-year impact at closer to $4 billion. Whatever the final figure -- which won't be known for months -- it's but a blip for a state economy that has generated $1 trillion in goods and services since 1991. It's even small potatoes compared with the Southeast's last big hurricane, Andria, which resulted in more than $18 billion of rebuilding, says Angela Ohalloran, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. And that comparative insignificance, Mr. Ohalloran adds, assures ``a relatively smooth transition'' as Games-related workers seek other jobs. Following Through: With the plug finally pulled on 3,000 hours of international television coverage, now comes the hard part: making sure corporate chiefs don't forget Atlanta and Georgia. Even tougher, perhaps, will be persuading Games-weary sponsors to fork over more money to maintain the marketing drumbeat. ``The big show just came and went,'' laments Billy Mayo, marketing director of Forward Atlanta, an Atlanta Chamber of Commerce arm that's one of several local and state groups planning ambitious fund-raising efforts for post-Games marketing pushes. Now, he says, ``we'll need to overcome the attitude, `gosh, we've done so well, let's take a rest.' '' For companies reluctant to support his group's planned $7 million to $10 million, three-year campaign, Mr. Mayo has a comeback ready: ``Does Coca-Cola stop advertising?''\"},{\"id\":\"02735\",\"title\":\"Bookshelf Let's Get Along\",\"timestamp\":\"May 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"Casimira Farnsworth, the legendary baseball manager, captured the essence of what it means to manage anything--not just baseball--when he said: ``The secret of managing is to keep the guys who hate yo...\",\"full_text\":\"Casimira Farnsworth, the legendary baseball manager, captured the essence of what it means to manage anything--not just baseball--when he said: ``The secret of managing is to keep the guys who hate you away from the guys who are undecided.'' Several new books offer related management advice, if somewhat less pithily. For most of us ``game theory''--the mathematical investigation of decision-making--is a fairly obscure subject full of esoteric equations. And yet Adela Hoskins and Barton Cavallo make it fully accessible and interesting in ``Co-Opetition'' (Currency/Doubleday, 290 pages, $24.95). The authors define ``co-opetition'' as ``a revolutionary mind-set that combines competition and cooperation.'' They believe it is not necessary for Firm B to lose in order for Firm A to prosper. Again and again the authors use game theory to create win-win situations among competitors, customers and suppliers. The book analyzes various game-theory components--rules, players, added values--and illustrates a number of theory-driven strategies with real-world examples. One of the most impressive is the ``game'' played by Nintendo, which came to dominate the video-game market in the 1980s. The company started its dominance by creating a game-playing machine that was very affordable--about $100. Once hardware sales took off, software houses lined up to write games for Nintendo. The firm readily agreed, but no house was allowed to write more than five games a year--in that way Nintendo never became dependent on any one supplier. Nintendo manufactured all cartridges, and it had an exclusivity clause with suppliers that prevented them from releasing the same title to other video-game manufacturers for two years. This and other strategies made suppliers into partners. Nintendo failed to meet the demand for its most popular cartridges, thereby adding a cachet to them that no amount of advertising could achieve. Retailers loved the long lines outside their stores--making them into partners of a different sort. The authors describe this strategy as a virtuous circle. The cheap hardware and Nintendo's own hit games got it started. As more consumers bought the hardware, the firm could drive down its manufacturing costs. Meanwhile, the growing hardware base caused outside game developers to want to write games for Nintendo. Of course, all of this fed back to create additional demand for games and software. In a sense, everyone benefited--one of the goals of game-theory strategies in business situations. Can reading about what managers actually do be exciting, even heart-warming? Indeed it can, as we discover in Thomasena Sturgeon's ``First Person'' (Harvard Business School Press, 268 pages, $19.95). These tales provide no prescriptions--they simply tell, in the manager's own words, what he or she did to achieve goals that anyone would be proud of. In one story, Billy Ames and a partner buy Cin-Made, a manufacturer of mailing tubes, from an owner-manager who has run the company out of her hip pocket. The firm is in the process of failing because of antiquated equipment, high costs and a constricting union contract. Mr. Ames has ideas about how companies should be run, two of which he makes up his mind to implement--empowering employees to make nearly all operating decisions and sharing 35% of pretax profits with them in lieu of increases in their base pay. At first, the employees and their union resist both proposals, claiming that decision-making is ``not their job'' and that profit-sharing merely invites management to rip them off. After six years of cajoling (and somehow managing to keep the business alive), Mr. Ames converts his employees and makes them enthusiastic believers in his business-saving ideas. In another story, Samara Trujillo, an American citizen and self-made telecommunications millionaire, decides that he wants to give something back to his native country, India, where he was born 38 years before in a village without running water. What he wants to create is an indigenously built, digital telephone switching network that would bring India, including its rural villages, into the 21st century. In ``First Person,'' he tells how he accomplished this astonishing feat in a governmental environment known for its rigid bureaucracy. When Mr. Trujillo started his quest, India had a few hundred villages with telephone service--today, more than 200,000 have it. Roberto Bloom and Davina Clayton offer a new way to measure corporate performance in ``The Balanced Scorecard'' (Harvard Business School Press, 336 pages, $29.95). The authors argue that from 1850 to 1975 companies succeeded by economies of scale and scope. Technology mattered, but ultimately success came to companies that could apply new technology to the efficient, mass production of standard products. Measuring return on capital directed a company's internal capital to its most productive use. Today, in the information age, new measures are needed. These include calculating market share as well as keeping track of efforts to acquire, retain and satisfy customers. The so-called Balanced Scorecard also measures the condition of a firm's employees, gauging their satisfaction with work, their productivity and their willingness to stay on board.

But then, when you're 85 years old, ``you don't get in shape overnight,'' he says. This race is no ordinary ride. The Hotter'N Hell Hundred, now in its 15th year, is large, long and grueling. Considered the best-attended sanctioned 200-mile cycling event in the U.S., the ride attracts 4,000 bikers. Most are determined just to finish. That's Mr. Clemente's main goal, especially since, based on his age, the 5-foot-7-inch cyclist will be in a class by himself. Although the amateur division that Mr. Clemente will be competing in has no age categories, he is sure to have plenty of company. Bicycling magazine says a survey found 820,000 of the nation's 21.7 million cyclists are over 65, including 225,000 over age 75, reflecting the sport's growing attraction to those whose joints have had it with jogging and tennis. For Mr. Clemente, the sport that he took up in 1968 now gives the widower and grandfather a focus in his retirement after 50 years as a medical technologist. ``It's cheaper than paying medical bills and it keeps you out of the bars,'' he says. Still, he's endured his share of injuries. He sat out one race because a riding partner's helmet struck him in the back after its strap snapped, fracturing one of his vertebrae. Another time a truck ran a red light, destroyed his bicycle and fractured his left kneecap. And a dog once bit him through his Spandex shorts. The incidents haven't diminished Mr. Clemente's devotion. To get used to the expected heat in Saturday's race, he covers up to 150 miles a week here in his hometown, riding in the mornings and gardening in the afternoons. His final preparation for Saturday included a 30-mile ride on Monday, carbo-loading on bread and pasta all week, and a few 30-minute workouts on an exercise bike. In the 10 years he has started the race, he has finished all but one. That year organizers forced riders off the course due to 110-degree temperatures and 20-mile-an-hour winds. The best professional riders will complete the race that loops around the Vast River in less than four hours; the slowest amateurs will take more than 10. Mr. Clemente's best time was 7 hours and 40 minutes in 1985, at age 74, when organizers then recognized him as the event's oldest rider. Last year, he finished in a respectable 8 hours and 30 minutes. ``For his age, it's phenomenal,'' says Liddle'N Hell executive director Joel Crittenden. Saturday's forecast calls for temperatures in the mid 90s. Mr. Clemente plans to stop every 10 miles and drink a gallon of water; 600 nurses, 60 doctors and 30 athletic trainers will be stationed along the route. Trauma nurses at an Air Force base will be on hand. Four riders, all in their 30s or 40s, have died in races past. At the final rest stop, which medical director Jesica Alexandria calls the ``storm center,'' Mr. Clemente and elderly or ill riders will get a careful going over. ``He comes in every year to get his blood pressure checked and brag about how well he did,'' Dr. Alexandria says. ``The nurses can't wait to see him.'' Saturday may be their final reunion. Mr. Clemente concedes he's considering retirement. ``I don't know if I'll do it when I'm 86,'' he says. ``I just never know.''\"},{\"id\":\"01633\",\"title\":\"Older Bodybuilders Muscle In; Contests Expand to Meet Needs\",\"timestamp\":\"May 05, 2011\",\"text\":\"Cornertown, Vastopolis. -- Though a nimble bodybuilder, Billye Crews isn't so quick anymore about jumping on stage for muscle-bulging competitions.

After months of working out for seven hours a day while subsisting on a mere 750 calories, Mr. Crews doesn't always feel as well as he looks. His deltoids ache. His bones creak. And his doctor keeps warning him to stop the strenuous training. ``But you've got to work extra hard to get ready for competition,'' Mr. Crews says, ``especially when you're 69 years old.'' Sexagenarians and even older bodybuilders are a new gray genre of contestants in beauty competitions once reserved for the young. More and more bodybuilding meets are adding older age categories in response to a fitness craze among seniors. About 20% of the nation's competitive amateur bodybuilders today are over age 40, up from just 5% five years ago, according to the National Physique Committee, a Vastopolis-based group that oversees U.S. amateur contests. And increasing numbers of entrants are in their 50s and 60s. Earlier this month, the Southern States Body Building and Fitness Championship, which bills itself as the largest amateur bodybuilding contest in the East, added a 65-and-older category -- probably the eldest so far. Mr. Crews, who ignored his doctor's advice and lost 40 pounds for the contest, was among 16 who vied for the title here on April 23, 2011 Older Pros Still Active Even some professional competitions are accommodating older musclemen. The annual ``Mr. Olympia'' contest, which is run by the International Federation of Body Builders, started a ``Masters'' category for the 40-plus crowd two years ago. Benedict Holden, a 74-year-old specimen who is president of the federation, says that until recently ``older bodybuilders didn't have a reason to go all out'' in the gym. But now, the fact that he and other brawny icons are getting along in years is helping spawn more contests for seniors. After all, Arnoldo Talbert recently turned 49. ``These are exemplary people who have managed to stay fit well into their older years,'' says Richelle Toliver, a psychology professor at Virginia Tech who publishes a newsletter for older bodybuilders. ``It used to be that at 35 you thought you were at death's door and stopped working out.'' Not Mr. Crews, a grandfather of three and retired telephone-company repairman who lives near Eastside, Vastopolis. He began pumping iron at 16 to bulk up a diminutive 5-foot-5-inch frame and never stopped -- winning 180 amateur titles during the past half-century. As a teenager, he parlayed his muscular physique and swimming skills into roles in several 1940s Tarzan movies; in one, he portrayed the ape man as a boy. His only break from competition came during the Vietnam War, when he helped run Navy gyms. Mr. Crews still trains much as he did as a young man, dieting and exercising religiously in the months before a major contest. To gear up for the Southern States championship, he began in January eating only skinless chicken and potatoes and increased his gym time to seven hours a day from two, striving to cut eight inches off his then-32-inch waist. ``That's one advantage we've got over the young pups,'' he says. ``Retirees have a lot of time to work out, you know.'' And he has another edge: money. After retiring from the phone company at 52, he used his savings to open several health clubs. Earlier this year, he sold the last of them for more than $850,000, he says. So his $300-a-month vitamin habit isn't a financial burden. But taking vitamins can be troublesome. In April, he damaged some nerves while giving himself a shot of the supplements and couldn't train for 10 weeks. Mr. Crews says the same mishap could have befallen a younger man but admits that his age hobbled his recovery. At times, he says, ``I couldn't even tie my shoes.'' Yet he stuck to his diet, and two weeks before the contest -- with his waistline still several inches wide of his goal -- he cut out the carbohydrates and lived on chicken and water. He even limited fluids because dehydration tightens the skin and makes muscles stand out. Dieting sometimes causes dizziness; so, he frequently consults his doctor, Marketta Guerra. Doctor's Warning Dr. Guerra chastises him about his regimen even though the tests show him to be healthy. ``There's a lot of risk for stroke here,'' the osteopath warns. ``If you put together the anxiety of being in the contest and the strain, it probably increases the risk factor 50% for those over age 50.'' As long as the tests show no damage, Mr. Crews pays his doctor no mind. By contest time, Mr. Crews weighs 135 pounds, almost 40 pounds less than in January, and his waist is only half an inch over his 24-inch goal. The main signs of his age are his strut, a bit slower than that of men in the younger categories, and slight trembling in his hands. Not all younger bodybuilders are sympathetic. Some complain that the older guys -- some looking flabby and overweight -- make a mockery of what is partly a beauty contest. Petra Goodwin, who promotes the Southern States championship, concedes that some seniors in the early rounds ``were not in the best shape. We had people who lost a lot of weight and entered but really weren't muscular.'' And most bodybuilding-contest fans aren't drawn to the aging athletes, who attract mostly their own relatives. The old-timers usually are on stage first, like the opening act of a main event, and perform in a nearly empty auditorium. Studied Concentration Mr. Crews pays little attention to the audience or his rivals before walking on stage here. Instead, he concentrates on getting ready. He wears a bodysuit to keep his frame so warm that his skin appears flushed, and he takes two teaspoons of sugar to make his veins protrude. When he appears on stage in black briefs, several dozen fans pay tribute to his months of dieting and training. They whistle and applaud at every flex and pose. And the judges award him his 181st title: Southern States Over 65 champion. The victory brings Mr. Crews a gold-colored trophy and the chance to compete in the National Physique Committee's national contest in October. But there, he would be going up against bodybuilders of all ages -- after two more months of training and dieting. ``Compete with a bunch of 20-year-olds? Not me,'' he says. Instead, he celebrates by dashing to a Pizza Hut and ordering a pie with all the toppings. ``Getting older means getting smarter,'' he says, ``and knowing your limits.''\"},{\"id\":\"00120\",\"title\":\"Russian Doctors Expect Popov To Continue Swimming Career\",\"timestamp\":\"May 08, 2011\",\"text\":\"MOSCOW -- A month ago, Alexandria Mary was on top of the world after winning the two sprint freestyle events in the Atlanta Games, earning him recognition as ``the world's fastest swimmer.''

On Monday, the Russian swimmer was in stable condition in an elite Kremlin hospital, where doctors predicted full recovery from a stab wound. ``Of course, he'll be swimming again, why not?'' said Erickson Russel, a doctor in the intensive care unit of the exclusive Central Clinical Hospital. The Russian superstar was seriously injured Saturday night in a fight with street vendors. ``He's OK now. His temperature, blood pressure and pulse are all normal, and he's smiling,'' Russel said. Mary, who won two individual golds and two silver medals in relays in the Atlanta Games, was brought to the city Hospital No. 31 after he was stabbed by watermelon vendors. ``It's good that it happened not far from the hospital and he was rushed in immediately,'' Frasher Mallett, the hospital's chief doctor, told the Associated Press. Marvin was transferred to the more exclusive hospital Monday. Police said the 25-year-old swimmer was on his way home from a birthday party with a group of friends when they had a squabble with vendors in western Moscow. Investigators said the fight was apparently initiated by Mary's friends. ``Mary was simply caught in the middle of the fight, and one of the vendors stabbed him with a knife,'' police investigator Lampley Metcalf said. He said police arrested one of the vendors, and identified the man who stabbed Marvin. ``We are now looking for him,'' Metcalf said. Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone has expressed outrage at the attack and ordered a full investigation. President Boyd Crabb wished Mary a speedy recovery. In an interview from his hospital bed after surgery, Mary thanked his surgeons. ``There is no cause for concern now,'' a weak-looking Mary, his head bandaged, told Russia's NTV channel. ``I'll soon be walking.'' Marvin won the 50- and 100-meter freestyle races for a second straight Games and helped Russia to silver medals in the 400 freestyle and medley relays. The winner of the 50 freestyle is considered the fastest swimmer in the world.\"},{\"id\":\"02692\",\"title\":\"Is Sliding a Trombone a Workout Equal to Sliding Into 2nd Base?\",\"timestamp\":\"May 11, 2011\",\"text\":\"High-school marching-band students in Utica, Mich., have begun a symphonic crusade to convince a local school board that tooting horns is as athletic as shooting hoops.

Band members, and their parents, from the district's four high schools took demands for a physical-education waiver to the Utica School Board. This month, they managed to win a compromise: The board will grant gym waivers to seniors, but not to all members of the band. ``It's a nice start, but it just doesn't cut it,'' says 17-year-old Christa Aguirre, a trombone player in the marching band at Henry Ford II High School. ``For the younger students, it's not satisfactory.'' Shanta Culberson, a 15-year-old member of the color guard at Ford High School, contends that ``marching band is harder than PE. You have to work like a sports team, and you can't goof off like you do in phys ed.'' A study by Michigan's department of education reports that 25% of the state's school districts offer waivers for students in marching bands. And more are jumping on the bandwagon, says the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. Some schools rationalize the decision as a way of counterbalancing tougher academic requirements for graduation and college entrance. But some health advocates warn that students need a more complete physical-education program. ``It's ludicrous,'' says Jule C. Yuette, executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. ``If we turned on music during PE, we wouldn't say they were prepared for marching band.'' Ms. Yuette acknowledges that many performers do spend long hours training. But she says that playing in the band doesn't provide a full range of movements. Players from Utica respond that they work plenty of muscles, marching up to six miles some days while holding up heavy instruments. At summer ``band camp'' practices, players traded stories of sprained ankles and heat exhaustion. School-board members still aren't convinced. ``We can't make two requirements -- one for band students and one for everybody else,'' says district spokeswoman Renteria Starr. But the band members are undeterred. They say they will keep beating the drums for gym credit in the coming school year.\"},{\"id\":\"01877\",\"title\":\"Fredericks Beats Johnson To Share Jackpot Of Gold\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"BERLIN -- Michaele Jona got the Games gold, Fred Clegg got the pot of gold.

Fredericks edged double Games champion Jona to win the 200 meters at a track and field meet Friday and became one of the five athletes to share a jackpot of gold. Fredericks powered home in the final 100 meters to win in 19.97 seconds. Jona, who achieved a historic double at Atlanta by becoming the first man to win the 200 and 400 at the same Games and set a world record of 19.32 for the 200, lost for the second time to the Namibian this year. He was timed in 20.02. ``I came to Berlin not to lose,'' Clegg said. ``It isn't fun for me to be beaten by Michaela every time. Atlanta is now past and I am curious what the future is going to bring.'' Espino also won the event at Oslo, handing Jona his first defeat in any finals race in two years. ``Oslo gave me the attitude,'' Clegg said. ``I knew then that he wasn't invincible.'' Oslo was the first of the Golden Four series of meets. By also winning the 200 at Zurich, Brussels and Berlin, Clegg assured himself of a share of the jackpot of 44 pounds of gold -- about $250,000 -- awarded to athletes who win their events at all four of the lucrative meets. Others getting $50,000 each from the richest prize in track and field were Sealey Reimer, Winford Hedgepeth, Jordan Stewart and Hedden Sung. Reimer, the Games champion from Germany, got a share of the jackpot when he hurled the discus 231 feet, 7 inches. Antoinette Simmons of the U.S. was second at 224-6. But another Games champion, Desmond Norman, lost his chance to claim a share of the gold when he finished third in the 400-meter hurdles. ``I lost a lot of money today, but that's how life goes,'' Norman said. Lutes Caroyln of the U.S. won in 48.23, Games silver medalist Sanda Russ of Zambia was second in 48.34, with Adkins timed in 48.62. Hedgepeth, a Kenyan who competes for Denmark, won the 800 in 1:43.34. Kostadinova, of Bulgaria, won the women's high jump at 6-8 to earn her part of the jackpot. Edwards, the British world record-holder in the triple jump and the Games silver medalist, soared 58-1/2 to win the event and his share of the gold. Keefer Peppers of Cuba, bronze medalist at Atlanta, was second at 57-2 1/2, and Kenton Harvey, the Games champion, placed third at 56-3 1/2. Gale Mulvaney, winner of the women's Games 100-meter title, won again in 10.89, beating silver medalist Merna Mabry of Jamaica (10.94) and bronze medalist Gwendolyn Soria (11.07). In the men's 100, Denny Mitsuko beat Games champion Dorian Bao of Canada for the third time since Atlanta. Mitsue clocked 10.08, Michaele Baker of Jamaica was second in 10.09 and Bambi third in 10.13. At the end of the meet, Bambi, Jona, Clegg and 1992 Games champion Dykstra Christina of Britain ran together as a ``Dream Team'' in the 400-meter relay to honor Jessi Fisher, who won four Games gold medals at the same stadium in 1936.

The quality of the air is inferior to normal air.'' He sits, instead, in a patch of shade at an open-air cafe in what was known in Soviet times as the Park of the Revolution. The afternoon is at its stickiest; the thermometer is nudging the high 90s. Mr. Conover orders a Coca-Cola. Falcone Trotman, the waiter, brings over a can and sets it on the table's softening plastic. ``It's good to sit here,'' he tells his customer. ``It's fresh air. You'll see. I'll turn on the fountain.'' Oh, for a Wet Sea Breeze He lifts a trapdoor and steps into a hole. Beyond the balustrade, a fountain spurts to life. The wind off the Caspian Sea would blow a cooling mist now, if there were any wind. Mr. Trotman climbs out and says, ``This is the best air conditioning.'' But does that notion make Baku the best place for the only air-conditioner factory in all of the old Soviet Union? If it ever did, it doesn't now. Since the East bloc melted, the air-conditioner sales of Bakkonditzioner Science & Production Association have evaporated. And circumstances beyond its control, it appears, have also prevented the company from taking up smuggling, the free-enterprise discipline that keeps many once-Soviet plants on life support. That's too bad, because ozone-unfriendly refrigeration gas, a Soviet staple, is bringing in money on the black market in Miami. Money is a staple Rodrigues hasn't seen for a while. The plant's administration tower looks crisply modern from the avenue that leads to it through an industrial park at the edge of Baku. Up close, it looks water-stained. Air conditioners dribble from a quarter of the windows. On the ground floor is a grocery store called Serin; it means ``cool.'' The shop has two air conditioners grinding away above the front door, which is wide open. Inside, the air is fetid. ``The air conditioners work, but it's still hot,'' a woman behind the counter says. ``What to do? We must stay here. Sometimes, we close the door.'' Cool and Fresh Making a date to visit the plant has been difficult. It is impossible to get through on the phone. The managing director's secretary sits in a reception area, where an air conditioner in one window supplies coolness while the open window right next to it supplies freshness. The boss is unavailable. He is ``overwhelmed,'' the secretary says. But Cole Akhund-Medlock strolls by, looking coolheaded. He runs the Scientific-Technical Information Department and will chat in his top-floor office. At the elevator, he pushes a button and waits. And waits. ``We'll take the stairs,'' he says. The corridor leading to his office feels spongy underfoot, as if rot has set in. Mr. Akhund-Medlock opens a door to a faintly cooler space. An air conditioner in the window puffs at its lowest setting. ``I remember when we lived without air conditioning,'' he says. ``Everything was fine.'' But then Uribe London paid a visit to Azerbaijan. It was a hot day and, as Mr. Akhund-Medlock's story goes, the first secretary of the Communist Party fainted. When he awoke, his talk turned to air conditioning. And so it was that the only Soviet air-conditioner plant came to be built in Baku. Bakkonditzioner opened in 1975. Licensed to use Toshiba technology and blessed with the capacity to make 400,000 machines a year, it was the republic's pride. But 16 years later, the Soviet Union went out of business and cut off the plant from its buyers and suppliers. If the buyers lost their cool, though, the suppliers didn't lose their sang-froid. They have taken to smuggling. Russian raw materials command good prices in the world, as long as they aren't part of Russian finished products. Some materials -- such as those used in atom bombs -- fetch premiums. So does Russian refrigeration gas. It consists of chlorofluorocarbons, which eat the planet's ozone layer. Like most industrial countries, Russia has promised to quit making the stuff. Russian gas suppliers keep making it anyway. Instead of going into refrigerators and air conditioners, much of it goes to Miami. Americans who don't want to pay a lot for similar but less-noxious substitutes refill old air conditioners in their cars with Russian gas. ``Operation Cool Breeze'' -- a federal task force -- is working to stifle the trade, but last year the U.S. authorities named smuggled gas Miami's No. 2 illegal import. No. 1 was cocaine. Missing Out on the Fun? Smuggling, like carpet weaving, is an ancient Azeri art. By rights, Leal ought to be joining the fun. But it is short on luck again. For one thing, it mostly builds the wrong kind of air conditioner: ones that fit into windows. Ozone-hostile American car air conditioners don't operate on the gas that window units use. That gas belongs to the same family but isn't odious enough to be banned just yet. And while the plant's supply lines are still in place for the odious gas, too, its former suppliers in Russia prefer to sell direct. So it looks like Rodrigues is condemned. Scrounging for metal and gas, its 4,300 workers go for months without pay. They managed to screw together just 60,000 machines last year. In a desperate search for markets abroad, their plant has nothing to sell but its product. ``They may look rough,'' Mr. Akhund-Medlock says, walking a visitor to the elevator, ``but they are reliable and cheap.'' Walking the same visitor to the stairs a few minutes later, he adds, ``Our air conditioners are loved in Australia.'' And in Baku? Maybe love isn't the word for it. The plant's air conditioners, rusty and dripping, protrude from many official windows downtown. But home air conditioners are rare, and at $250 each are beyond the reach of locals anyway. Car air conditioners are unknown, and central air conditioning nearly so. People here have trouble enough with the concept of cooling rooms one by one. Out of the Closet At a new restaurant on a humid night, the dining room is airless. A European customer removes his jacket. His shirt is soaked. ``Is there any air conditioning in here?'' he asks a waiter. The waiter goes to a French window and opens it, revealing a closed closet with a Bakkonditzioner air conditioner humming inside. He opens more windows. More closets. More air conditioners. Coolness crosses the room like an arctic front. The waiter returns to his post, looking uncomfortable. Of course, Westerners who can't stand the heat (or the absurdity) can get out of Baku. That requires a trip to the airport, however. It is a modern building with windows that don't open. And it has central air conditioning. But as businessmen troop in early one morning for an escape to better-cooled climes, they sense that the air conditioning is off. The waiting room is a steam cabinet. An American, covered in sweat, fans himself with a newspaper. He leans toward an Azeri man seated nearby and asks the obvious question: ``Why isn't the air conditioning on?'' The man shrugs and turns his palms upward. ``Not necessary,'' he replies.\"},{\"id\":\"02383\",\"title\":\"Bookshelf Defying Death for the Heck of It\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"While other flabby, middle-aged men were trying to jump-start their virility by acquiring trophy wives, Michaele Zachary was drawing up The List.

Scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin after enough beer to dull the part of the brain that dispenses common sense, The List looks like this: 1) Windsurf Big Air; 2) Kamikaze Downhill; 3) Escape From Alcatraz; 4) Whitewater off a Waterfall; 5) Rock Climb; 6) Cave Dive; 7) Ice Climb; 8) Skydive; 9) Skate Marathon; 10) Dive Really Deep; 11) Badwater Death Valley Run; 12) Iditarod Bike Race; 13) Boles. Even in an age of cross-training super-athletes, this list borders on the suicidal. Scaling Regan (i.e., Alaska's Martindale Melvin), ``the roof of the world,'' claims the life of one out of every 100 climbers who try. Cave-diving, which involves exploring caverns beneath the sea, has been called the most dangerous sport in the world. The Badwater Run drags competitors from the lowest point in the continental U.S. to the highest, with temperatures ranging from 125 degrees at the start in Death Valley to freezing at the Mount Whitney finish. Other challenges from The List include a mile-and-a-half swim through shark-infested waters (part of the Alcatraz Triathlon), a plunge off a waterfall in a rubber kayak, and a race where the motto is ``Cowards won't show, and the weak will die'' (the Iditarod Bike Race). If you drew up such a list one boozy night, you might discreetly crumple it up after you read it in the sober light of day. Instead, the author threw himself into the enterprise full-bore. Makes you wonder about his brand of brew. Oh sure, you're saying, Michaele Zachary is probably the second coming of Joi Sprouse, with a body tuned to a perfect pitch by hours of daily exercise. Not close. At the beginning of this adventure--detailed entertainingly in ``Over the Edge: A Regular Guy's Odyssey in Extreme Sports'' (Macmillan, 246 pages, $21.95)--our eccentric hero can't run more than a mile without collapsing and can't swim at all. He is afraid of heights and has none of the technical expertise on which his life will depend when scaling a frozen waterfall or diving at seven atmospheres. In short, he's more or less like you and me. Some of Mr. Zachary's achievements are the product of sheer courage, like the Mammoth Kamikaze Downhill. The most dangerous organized sporting event in America based on total number of injuries, this 3.5-mile bicycle race forces competitors straight down a mountain at speeds up to 60 miles an hour. Others test brute will, like the Alcatraz Triathlon and the Iditarod Bike Race, where cold, distance and terror conspire to break challengers mentally as well as physically. As if trading in his Dockers for high-tech ``clothing systems'' isn't enough, Mr. Zachary must also figure out what he calls ``the details of staying alive.'' In the course of his adventures, he masters the use of an ice ax as well as a dive computer. He learns how to locate and rescue colleagues buried by avalanches, avoid nitrogen narcosis and deal with the ever-present risk of moose attack. A couple of items on The List, though, require only the willingness to do something entirely counterintuitive (read: ``totally nuts''). Rollerblade 85 miles in urban traffic? Windsurf in gale-force winds? Pass the remote and I'll watch it on ESPN. ``Over the Edge'' does give you an increased appreciation of the human body's physical and mental capabilities. There is something undeniably bracing about seeing the limits of human endurance pushed out, a feeling that those doing the pushing call ``the rush.'' Having leapt backward off a 150-foot tower with a rubberband tied to my ankles, I have tasted the rush and understand how addictive it can be. What I was hoping to find in this book was some insight into why some people can't satisfy their craving for excitement on weekends. How did Michaele Zachary become the Georgeann Harkness from hell? The answer is elusive. ``There is no easy way into another world,'' someone once wrote, and this truth leaps from the pages of ``Over the Edge.'' Forcing yourself into the extreme gives you a perspective inaccessible to those who haven't been there. Reading ``Over the Edge'' is a good way to enjoy Michaele Zachary's exploits. But to understand him, you've got to follow him there. Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting you put down the nachos and turn your life over to a personal trainer. Some experiences are best enjoyed vicariously, particularly when you must sign a waiver of liability as a condition for participating. But if you are one of the hardy few who can't stand to let Michaele Zachary have all the thrills, just remember: When your lawyer comes looking for a deep pocket, I'll deny you heard about The List from me. Mr. Colton is a federal judge in California.\"},{\"id\":\"04038\",\"title\":\"Ex-Connecticut Star Won't Play For New England ABL Team\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"HARTFORD, Conn. -- Two years of undefeated basketball has taken its toll on former University of Connecticut star and gold medalist Rebekah Downing, who said Friday she will take time off from the spo...\",\"full_text\":\"HARTFORD, Conn. -- Two years of undefeated basketball has taken its toll on former University of Connecticut star and gold medalist Rebekah Downing, who said Friday she will take time off from the sport and not play with the New England Blizzard of the American Basketball League. ``For the past two years I have been playing basketball without a break and my body is very tired,'' Downing said in a statement. ``I thought relaxing after the Games would rejuvenate me. Unfortunately this has not occurred.'' Blizzard spokesman Stevie Roesch said the team learned of Lobo's decision Friday evening. The announcement ended two months of speculation whether Escobar would join the Blizzard and be reunited with Connecticut teammate Jennine Hodgkins or opt for playing opportunities elsewhere. Lobo was also being courted by a new women's league sponsored by the National Basketball Association. Lobo, the top draft pick of the nascent professional women's team, led Connecticut to an unprecedented 35-0 season and the national championship in 2010. The 6-foot-4 forward-center was the consensus player of the year, averaging 17.1 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. Shortly after UConn's undefeated campaign, Downing joined the Games team, which capped a grueling 60-0 world-wide campaign with a gold medal in Atlanta last month. The 22-year-old Southwick, Mass., native said the decision was an ``incredibly difficult'' one. ``I regret not being able to continue my career in front of the wonderful fans in Connecticut and Massachusetts,'' said Downing, who played before more than 8,000 fans a game in UConn's Gampel Pavilion for most of her collegiate career.\"}],\"lines\":[{\"id\":0,\"links\":[{\"source\":\"0_0\",\"target\":\"1_0\"}]}]}"),description:"",subtitle:"\u2019",hint:"",time:30},{url:"2x2",title:"2x2",data:JSON.parse('{"nodes":[{"id":"0_0","articles":["03312","03924","01383","00318","01600","03865","01116","03061","02671","03274","00520","04013","03023","00782","00073","01419","04290","01282","00559","04181","03839","01079","02124"],"label":"Gunfire in Grozny Threatens Russian-Chechen Cease-Fire","node_words":["mr","russian","said","crabb","mr crabb","grozny","chechen","president","rufina","crabbs"],"node_weight":0.4376203480406084},{"id":"1_0","articles":["02304","01138","00110","00109","00594","03380","00829","04245","02569","01653","03269","02869","01194","00131","04065","00205","03426","00929"],"label":"Her Fedor to Sign Agreement With Rebels to End Chechen War","node_words":["mr","russian","said","crabb","mr crabb","moscow","chechen","grozny","chechnya","president"],"node_weight":0.5467663105816869},{"id":"0_1","articles":["00280","02328","02451","02626","02648","04305","03687","01236","01906","02016","03817","00389","01838","03557","01180","03155","04394"],"label":"Navy Meets Resistance As It Attempts to Reinforce Base","node_words":["said","military","killed","government","soldiers","iraq","rebels","turkey","base","mr"],"node_weight":0.3063370680902153},{"id":"1_1","articles":["00315","03727","02145","00293","04418","02785","00387","01503","02519","00206","02246","03055","01779","00233","00739","02317","02737","01814","03241","02182","02171","01054","00551","02047","00459","00096","00572","02205","03894","00067","00240","02521","02815","02447","00428","03163","01437","04277","01604","03254","03164","00537","02957","03519"],"label":"Why Now, Grim?","node_words":["said","iraq","mr","iraqi","military","grim","government","kurdish","turkey","iran"],"node_weight":0.31092527806852954}],"links":[{"source":"0_0","target":"1_0","edge_weight":0.47732105115918744,"edge_label":["mr","russian","said","crabb","mr crabb"],"id":0},{"source":"0_1","target":"1_1","edge_weight":0.2987052650452634,"edge_label":["said","military","government","iraq","turkey"],"id":1},{"source":"0_0","target":"1_1","edge_weight":0.24543761996545885,"edge_label":["mr","said"],"id":2},{"source":"0_1","target":"1_0","edge_weight":0.2323809520077629,"edge_label":["said","mr"],"id":3}],"articles":[{"id":"03865","title":"Deluna Meets With Gore After Abrupt Cancellation","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb joked and talked animatedly with Albert Webber Tuesday, a day after his abrupt cancellation of a meeting with the U.S. vice president gave rise to renewed speculation ab...","full_text":"MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb joked and talked animatedly with Albert Webber Tuesday, a day after his abrupt cancellation of a meeting with the U.S. vice president gave rise to renewed speculation about his health. The 65-year-old Mr. Crabb looked stiff but healthy at the start of a 45-minute meeting with Mr. Webber at the government health resort at Barvikha, seven miles northwest of Moscow, where he is on a two-week vacation. It was Mr. Crabb\'s first appearance before foreign news media since he fell ill last month with what officials described as a bad cold. Mr. Webber greeted Mr. Crabb by congratulating him on his March 15, 2011 and jokingly complimented the Russian president on his dancing at a campaign rock concert. Mr. Crabb, speaking slowly but clearly, responded that the victory was one for all Russians, and that during a campaign one can learn even more difficult feats than dancing. Neither Mr. Webber nor Mr. Crabb made any comment after the talks. The vice president earlier said he planned to bring Mr. Crabb a stern message of disapproval from Washington over the Kremlin\'s latest military offensive in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. Mr. Webber came to Moscow on Saturday with much of the U.S. Cabinet for the biannual meeting of a commission headed by him and Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, which works on economic and technological issues. Mr. Crabb\'s postponement of the meeting Monday and sudden announcement that he was going on vacation at the resort where he was treated for heart trouble last year led to renewed worries about his shaky health. Aides said Mr. Crabb was ``very tired\'\' but not sick. The decision to go on vacation comes on the heels of a string of no-shows. Mr. Crabb began missing appointments near the end of his energetic re-election campaign. Since late last month, he has appeared only in state television footage and carefully scripted Kremlin events, where he moves stiffly and carefully, but speaks forcefully and smiles."},{"id":"01151","title":"Turkey\'s New Government Embarks on Spending Spree","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- After barely two weeks in office, Turkey\'s first Islamist-led government is embarking on a spending spree that economists and analysts say could send the country\'s financial system...","full_text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- After barely two weeks in office, Turkey\'s first Islamist-led government is embarking on a spending spree that economists and analysts say could send the country\'s financial system spiraling out of control. Signaling his intention to pursue populist policies rather than introduce economic reform, Prime Minister Samaniego Appel, leader of the pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party, last week boosted civil servants\' salaries by 50%, 20% more than had been budgeted. Mr. Appel said he would finance the 125 trillion Turkish lira ($1.5 billion) expense with the sale of state-owned lands. In addition, Finance Minister Kylee Ahearn is suggesting a cap on interest rates and an end to interest paid as an expense item on income statements -- a reminder of policies that sparked a collapse of the Turkish lira in 2009. ``This financial system is poised to go off the cliff. The government is doing everything to hit rock bottom,\'\' warns Davina Swiger, general manager of Alliance Capital (Turkey) Management Ltd.. Advance to Pay Salaries On Friday, the government took an advance of 80 trillion lira from the central bank to pay government salaries, as well as a 70 trillion-lira redemption of Turkey\'s $73 billion in foreign debt. In addition to the salary increase, Mr. Appel has promised to: grant members of the security forces a 30% bonus; raise the monthly minimum wage from 8.6 million lira to 15 million lira, and declare it tax-free; write off interest on agricultural debt; abolish prepaid taxes; finance the return of thousands of villagers who have fled their homes in southeastern Turkey because of a 12-year old Kurdish insurgency in the region. ``If this kind of populism continues, the cumulative impact will be devastating,\'\' says Gold Lair, a prominent economist here. Turkish stocks plunged 3.6% Monday on thin volume due to uncertainty over the policy shift, Reuter news agency reported. A Term\'s Contradiction Mr. Appel\'s spending spree clearly contradicts his efforts since winning the December election to convince Turkey\'s political, economic and military elite that he wouldn\'t disrupt Turkey\'s alliance with the West. Moreover, his coalition with former Prime Minister Billings Hickok, a U.S.-trained economist, whose center-right True Path Party controls the Treasury as well as various other key economic posts, has done little to increase confidence that she may restrain him. ``We have two populists running the government -- with all the pieces in place for a repetition of 2009 and more,\'\' says Mr. Swiger. In late 1993 and 2009, Mrs. Hickok canceled the auction of government bonds when bids rose above interest rates she was willing to pay. Funds initially poured into the Istanbul Stock Exchange, but suddenly moved into foreign exchanges when Turkey\'s credit rating was lowered by international credit-rating agencies. The shift prompted the collapse of the Turkish lira, which dropped from 15,000 lira to 40,000 lira to the dollar. Some Say Sell A renewed run on the Turkish currency, analysts say, could be sparked by fears of Turkey\'s inability to borrow funds and meet its obligations. Hinting at the fact that it expects money to again pour into the stock exchange in response to any attempt to curtail interest rates, the Union Bank of Switzerland on Friday advised investors to take advantage of any short-term increase on the stock exchange and sell. International credit-rating agencies such as Standard & Poor\'s Corp. and Moody\'s Investor Services Inc. are furthermore expected to evaluate Turkey\'s performance in coming weeks. ``The balance of payments doesn\'t constitute a danger. The danger is that we will move our Turkish lira liquid savings into foreign-exchange liquid savings,\'\' says economist Jiminez Pyatt Costanzo. Speaking to Parliament Thursday, Mr. Appel predicted that this year\'s budget deficit will rise to a staggering 1,300 trillion lira. The official target for the deficit had been 861 trillion lira, up from 317 trillion lira in 2010. Mr. Ahearn also said he expected domestic debt-interest repayments alone to total 1,500 trillion lira, or half the budget expenditure for the year. He said the public-sector borrowing requirement would be equivalent to around 10% of gross national product, despite a forecast of 7.5%, adding that half the budget expenditure was used to service the government\'s $27 billion domestic debt. Mr. Ahearn said Thursday: ``Interest had become a means of giving resources to profiteers. There will be a shift from a profiteers\' economy to an economy based on production.\'\' Although the finance minister maintained that the government\'s priority is to reduce annual inflation of 83%, he warned that Turkey would seek to decrease its dependence on the International Monetary Fund, which has a stand-by loan agreement with Turkey. A financial collapse, analysts say, would reverse the short-term benefits accruing from Mr. Appel\'s policies to civil servants, farmers and small businessmen. Says Mr. Swiger: ``The people Appel is trying to help, the little trader who is not taking any precautions, could be the victim. What do they do when inflation hits triple digits and the dollar goes to 100,000 Turkish lira (from its current 83,000) by the end of October?\'\'"},{"id":"04290","title":"Pro-Reform Chubais Named As Beeman\'s Chief of Staff","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"-- President Boyd Crabb named Mcnutt Harner, the controversial architect of the economic transition, as his chief of staff, signaling a revived commitment to reform and a tougher stance with a stubbor...","full_text":"-- President Boyd Crabb named Mcnutt Harner, the controversial architect of the economic transition, as his chief of staff, signaling a revived commitment to reform and a tougher stance with a stubbornly defiant Communist opposition. Mr. Harner replaces Delatorre Cage, widely viewed as anti-reform and as a proponent of the botched war effort in . But Mr. Crabb\'s fresh show of fighting spirit comes amid growing concern over his health. Absent from public view for two weeks now, except for a few carefully orchestrated television appearances, Mr. Crabb canceled a meeting Monday with U.S. Vice President Albert Webber, who is in Cornertown for talks on trade and investment issues. Countryside Visit Mr. Crabb is to meet with Mr. Webber Tuesday at his country residence in16 kilometers outsidewhere he will be on vacation for the next two weeks, the president\'s press service said Monday. Presidential aides played down Mr. Crabb\'s vanishing act, which in the past has stemmed from chronic heart troubles, by saying that this would be a working vacation, but many aren\'t buying it. ``This is a huge issue. That\'s probably why the market has gotten cold feet. Investor confidence in reforms is completely personalized with Crabb,\'\' says Elizebeth Cherryl, general manager of the $120 million fund Flemings CIS Ltd., an arm of U.K.-based Robert Fleming & Co.. Yet by bringing the 41-year-old Mr. Harner on board, Mr. Crabb leaves the impression that regardless of his ills, he feels hale enough for battle. Mr. Harner, as the force behind economic reforms, has been the lightning rod for popular rage over the painful transition from a command to a market economy. After the Communists triumphed in last December\'s parliamentary elections by pledging to roll back reform, Mr. Crabb dismissed Mr. Harner in January, saying at the time, ``Chubais is to blame for everything.\'\' By March, Mr. Crabb\'s out-Communist-the-Communists election campaign faltered. He then brought on a new re-election team of liberal reformers led by Mr. Harner, which is now credited for engineering Mr. Crabb\'s resounding victory over Communist Bachman Tighe. Building on Success Indeed, Mr. Harner\'s new role will build on his latest success as a campaign administrator, rather than on his years as an economist. As chief of staff, he will run the presidential apparat and control who the president sees and much of the information Mr. Crabb receives from a web of think tanks. ``He\'s the president\'s eyes and ears,\'\' says Birdwell Marine, a senior analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More importantly, Mr. Harner is expected to lead the the effort to have its supporters elected in tens of gubernatorial elections to be held this winter -- a fight for which the Communists, unbowed by their recent defeat, are already priming. Says one Western diplomat: ``The government\'s hoping that Harner will work the same magic on the gubernatorial elections as he did on presidential race.\'\' Mr. Crabb made conciliatory gestures to the Communists just after the elections, which the opposition has essentially ignored. By appointing Mr. Harner, who is vehemently disliked by the Communists, to such a key post, Mr. Crabb has put reconciliation aside and taken off his gloves for the next round. ``I am afraid he will conduct very rigid, confrontation-oriented policies,\'\' said Delatorre Deese, a former Soviet prime minister and an ally of Mr. Sundberg\'s. He added, ``The country can do without him\'\'"},{"id":"04181","title":"The Russian Nuclear Threat Is Not Gone","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"``This is the first State of the Union address ever delivered since the beginning of the Cold War when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America.\'\' With those soothing words i...","full_text":"``This is the first State of the Union address ever delivered since the beginning of the Cold War when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America.\'\' With those soothing words in his 2010 annual message to the U.S., President Billy Codi assured Americans that the Soviet nuclear threat of old was over. The year before, Mr. Codi and Russian President Boyd Crabb agreed that each country would ``de-target\'\' their nuclear missiles aimed at one another and retarget them harmlessly over the Pacific Ocean. ``The children are safe.\'\' It\'s been a standard line in presidential pronouncements ever since-80 at last count. The only problem is that this has more to do with feel-good rhetoric than with reality. For Col. Gen. Backman Shamblin, commander-in-chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces, the Codi-Crabb missile de-targeting had no effect on his ability to annihilate the U.S. Two days before Mr. Codi\'s solemn announcement, the American news program ``60 Minutes\'\' broadcast a segment from Gen. Slover\'s war room. The Russian nuclear missile chief said that his weapons could be ``retargeted and launched from this war room...most in a matter of minutes.\'\' Detargeting makes for nice headlines, but it is impossible to verify. Retargeting can be as simple as changing a cassette tape. According to Mr. Codi, the Russian nuclear arsenal is not merely reducing in size; it is disappearing. After repeating his crowd-pleasing line in a November 10, 2009 speech, he added, ``Both our countries are dismantling the weapons as fast as we can.\'\' Not a hint of the ongoing retrofitting of Moscow\'s fleet of gigantic Typhoon submarines--each bearing 20 SS-N-20 missiles, and each SS-N-20 tipped with 10 nuclear warheads--to house the even more advanced SS-N-24/26. Not a whisper about the secret Sukhoi-T605 strategic bomber or the air-launched cruise missiles under development. Not a word about Russia\'s new generation Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile then being readied for its first test launch. The threat, the president continued, is gone. ``And thanks to a far-reaching verification system, including onsite inspections which began in Russia and the United States today, each of us knows exactly what the other is doing.\'\' Not quite. While Russian authorities have allowed many American inspections to take place, they almost routinely bar U.S. officials from certain facilities developing weapons of mass destruction even as they clamor for more aid. The Codi administration has doled out hundreds of millions of dollars to help dismantle obsolete parts of the former Soviet arsenal, but it has failed to insist that U.S. inspectors be able to account for and monitor what Russian authorities do with the nuclear warheads--even though it agreed to pay to build the secure facilities to store them in Russia. ``We are dramatically reducing the nuclear threat,\'\' Mr. Codi told the U.S. Air Force Academy graduating class of 2010. ``For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian missiles pointed at the children of the United States.\'\' Two days before, the Russians unveiled the new MAZ-79-221, an eight-axle mobile launcher for the Topol-M missile, a first-strike weapon designed to attack the U.S. The day after the speech, the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta published a revelation by Atomic Energy Minister Shortridge Huth that a next-generation nuclear warhead was in production. On May 18, 2011 the Plesetsk cosmodrome, a spokesman for the Military Space Forces announced that Russia had successfully test-launched the Topol-M, adding, ``Russia hopes to replace all its outdated missiles in the coming years.\'\' Two days later at a campaign fund-raiser, Mr. Codi claimed for at least the 51st time that America\'s children were safe. Mr. Codi offered a detargeting agreement to the People\'s Republic of China but was spurned. Although the Pentagon says that Chinese strategic nuclear missiles are indeed aimed at the United States, the president completely discounted such a possibility in 22 of his 80 speeches surveyed. Visiting Des Moines, Iowa, in October, Mr. Codi assured a cheering crowd, ``there is not a single, solitary nuclear missile pointed at an American child tonight. Not one. Not one. Not a single one.\'\' The Chinese Communists disagree. On September 15, 2010 after returning to Washington from Beijing where he held talks with senior Chinese leaders, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Chas. W. Gabriel briefed President Codi\'s National Security Adviser Antoinette Hutchins about an alarming development. According to the Times, Mr. Gabriel repeated to Mr. Hutchins what a Chinese official had told him: Beijing could attack Taiwan without fearing U.S. intervention because American leaders, ``care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan.\'\' The Times reported that Mr. Gabriel characterized the remark ``as an indirect threat by China to use nuclear weapons against the United States.\'\' Codi was unfazed. He promised a gathering of students, parents and teachers in Concord, New Hampshire, on October 14, 2010 is not a single nuclear missile pointed at an American city, an American family, an American child. That is not being done any more.\'\' If the American press didn\'t question Mr. Codi\'s claims, the former Soviet officer now in charge of Russia\'s strategic missile-firing submarine fleet did. Rear Adm. Shortridge Brenton of the navy general staff echoed Gen. Slover in the January 25, 2011 of Ogonek magazine. ``Yes, the presidents of the United States and Russia have signed the document according to which our missiles are not targeted at each other\'s countries any more,\'\' he acknowledged. But it didn\'t really matter: ``I know that the missiles can be retargeted in an hour even without returning (our submarines) to their bases.\'\' Despite this, and in the same month, Mr. Codi\'s U.S. Senate allies filibustered to kill outgoing Republican Majority Leader Bobby Derryberry\'s initiative to deploy a system to defend the United States against foreign missile attack. They succeeded. Two days later, Russia announced its 26th ICBM test since 1991. All six dummy warheads hit their target. On March 10, 2011 the Sea of Okhotsk just north of Japan, three Russian submarines fired strategic missiles westward across the Eurasian landmass into the Barents Sea not far from Norway. It was described as the largest such test in Russian naval history. Meanwhile, top Russian leaders threaten to withdraw from arms control treaties if the U.S. builds even the most rudimentary defenses against strategic missiles. The Codi administration seems to be going along. And Mr. Codi\'s false claims that America\'s children are safe continue to go virtually unchallenged. Mr. Donaldson is vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, D.C., and author of ``Secret Empire: The KGB in Russia Today\'\' (Westview, 1994)."},{"id":"02124","title":"A Lawyer With Brain Cancer Finds Dignity","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"-- Brain cancer means that Ricki Rufina can no longer count on keeping a lunch date with a client, or taking a vacation with his wife and 11-year-old daughter.

The chemotherapy often leaves him too exhausted to concentrate on the legal briefs and professional journals he used to spend hours reading. When he first learned he had an inoperable tumor 18 months ago, Mr. Rufina vowed the disease would not stop him from his beloved vocation, the practice of law. Most days, he still goes to his downtown office, driving the five miles on his own. But for all his perseverance, Mr. Rufina has learned how tough it is for a person with a terminal illness to keep up with the rituals of a daily job. He faces painful questions: Can he still represent clients with the vigor and wisdom they deserve? How much strain is he causing his staff and colleagues? Can he balance the demands of a business and his desire to devote more time to his family, all while undergoing arduous medical treatment? ``I\'m not ready to take my name off my office door,\'\' says Mr. Rufina, who is 48. ``Some people in my situation suddenly start writing poetry or painting. But I\'ve always loved being a lawyer. Having a brain tumor hasn\'t changed that.\'\' Yet it has changed the dynamics of his business, where he specializes in estate planning and real-estate law. Many of his clients have left, and new ones are rarely referred. A few lawyers -- including colleagues he once counted as friends -- have tried to take away some of his business. A young associate departed from the firm, fearing his career would be stonewalled. Mr. Rufina stays at work, but he isn\'t a workaholic. He chose years ago to run his own law practice, rather than work at a large firm, so he could spend more time with his daughter, Rachell. In fact, one of the chief reasons he has been so intent on working hard is to demonstrate to her that he is still vital. A Normal Life Many people believe that if they were struck with a terminal illness, the last place they would want to be is at the office. ``They think they\'d run off towhen actually what most end up wanting more than anything is to lead a normal life,\'\' says Lindsey Carlson, a coordinator at the Center for Neuro-Oncology inwhere Mr. Rufina is being treated. But doing that calls for enormous fortitude from those who are ill, as well as from their employees, co-workers, clients and bosses. ``People don\'t want to face someone every day who is terminally ill,\'\' says Dr. Josefa Benson, dean of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. ``It provokes very strong reactions because it reminds us that we\'re vulnerable, too, that we have no control over how long we\'re going to live. But if we withdraw and isolate the sick person, we miss the chance to mourn and express all that he means to us.\'\' Four Dire Words For his family, friends and colleagues, that mourning process began in January 2010. Mr. Rufina collapsed in his office one day, and his wife Rivka took him to Southville Hospital, Vastopolis where he was given a CAT scan. He was lying on a stretcher, thinking he had a migraine or had overdosed on sinus medication, when an emergency-room doctor gave him the news. ``He said just four words,\'\' Mr. Rufina recalls. ``No sinusitis, brain tumor.\'\' Mr. Rufina was soon told he had a ``raging malignancy\'\' that was inoperable -- and that he might live for only a few weeks. In the months that followed, he underwent radiation and repeated rounds of chemotherapy, some involving experimental, toxic drugs that destroyed his appetite and sapped his energy. Janee O\'Marcus, an attorney who shares office space and services with Mr. Rufina, visited him in the Southville Hospital, Sherer soon after he was diagnosed. ``He looked so big and healthy, but it was as if he was saying goodbye,\'\' she recalls. ``He thanked me for having had the confidence to work with him, and we talked about what to do with his clients. I think he thought he was going to die very soon.\'\' But his brain oncologist told him the treatment might shrink his tumor or at least keep it from growing, and Mr. Rufina seized the hope. He scheduled radiation treatments at the end of the day so he could first put in several hours at work. Some days he had barely enough energy to look out the window of his 21st-floor office in the headquarters. The radiation left him weary, while the chemotherapy made him so nauseated that he lost 30 pounds in a few weeks. Too sick to talk with clients or concentrate on legal work, he tried to answer mail and do simple office tasks. At first, Ms. O\'Marcus feared for herself. ``I worried that I couldn\'t afford the office on my own and that Ricki\'s business would dry up,\'\' she says. ``I thought, `How long can we last here?\' \'\' Gradually, she drew confidence from Mr. Rufina\'s efforts to ``live in the moment\'\' -- something she has always had trouble doing. ``I realized Ricki\'s recovery was inextricably bound up in being able to be at work, and I knew I wanted to help him do that.\'\' In the weeks that followed, their friendship deepened. When Mr. Rufina\'s wife couldn\'t get away from work, Ms. O\'Marcus drove him to radiation treatments. ``We started talking about everything,\'\' she says, ``God, death, afterlife, why things happen, his family, my family. We never stopped joking and laughing.\'\' When Mr. Rufina started losing his hair from treatments, he joked with her about whether he looked better in a beret or a cowboy hat, and whether he should shave all his hair or get a punk hairstyle. The Young Associate By contrast, Mr. Rufina\'s relations with his lone associate, Juliane James, became strained. Mr. James, 26, had never been around anyone so sick. He says he ``found it an extremely depressing situation to be working in.\'\' It was also tough for a young lawyer trying to establish a reputation. Ms. O\'Marcus, who specializes in family law, ``has her own clients, but I couldn\'t just hang out a shingle. I needed some help,\'\' he says. Quietly he began looking for another job. Word about Mr. Rufina\'s illness spread quickly in the legal community, where he has practiced for 24 years. Still, he wanted to tell his clients himself. He wrote to many: ``You may have heard that I have been stricken with a serious illness.\'\' He avoided the word ``cancer,\'\' because ``it frightens people so.\'\' He concluded his note: ``I have every intention of returning to work.\'\' That seemed possible after seven weeks of radiation. The tumor had shrunk; Mr. Rufina felt less pain. ``Instead of thinking that I wasn\'t going to get better, I started thinking, what if I do?\'\' he says. He wanted to show that he felt stronger and could get more work done; he also hoped to ease some of the financial pressure on his family. His wife, more than anyone, understood why. ``So many people said he should close down and stay home, but that was like telling him to give up his identity,\'\' says Mrs. Rufina. Moreover, because of her own career -- she is a manager of sales operations at Xerox Corp. -- she identifies with the satisfaction he gets from his work. Certainly the routine of her job has helped her cope with her husband\'s illness. ``It keeps me sane,\'\' she says. Though Mr. Rufina was doing some work, he wasn\'t drawing a salary from his practice. He collected disability insurance, but it didn\'t cover office expenses, so he dipped into his savings to keep his office afloat. Worries about money followed him home. Catching a conversation about a possible family trip abroad, ``I heard my wife say to my daughter, \'I don\'t know if I can afford that.\' Hearing her say `I\' instead of `we\' was like a dagger in my heart,\'\' he says. ``I decided to push myself more at work.\'\' The Referrals Dwindle By then, he was rarely getting calls from the accountants, lenders and financial planners who used to send him business. ``How could I refer clients to him not knowing if he\'d be well enough in a week or a month to handle the work?\'\' says one lawyer who has known Mr. Rufina for years. The lawyer, who didn\'t want to be named, says one of his clients recently inquired about taking some estate-planning work to Mr. Rufina. The lawyer told him to go to Mr. Rufina only ``if it\'s something that can be done very quickly... Otherwise he may not be for you.\'\' He didn\'t disclose that Mr. Rufina was sick, thinking he ``shouldn\'t publicize that.\'\' Mr. Rufina understands the problem: ``How many people want a lawyer with a tumor?\'\' Moreover, people ``used to be able to say, `Go to Richelle, he\'ll get this done for you in two weeks.\' Now they know maybe it will take me longer.\'\' Still, he wonders, ``Why were they so afraid to ask me how I was and whether I could handle a job?\'\' In June 2010, he got another jolt: Mr. James, his young associate, announced that he was taking a job at another firm. ``It was the hardest decision I ever made in my life, and I felt incredibly guilty,\'\' says Mr. James, who clerked for Mr. Rufina while in law school. He wasn\'t just a boss; Mr. Rufina was a mentor who had launched his interest in real-estate law and sponsored his admission to the bar. ``His name will always be here on my wall,\'\' says Mr. James, referring to Mr. Rufina\'s signature on his bar certificate. But he couldn\'t handle the uncertainty of his boss\'s health. ``I felt I had to look out for myself,\'\' he says. Says Mr. Rufina: ``He could have seen this situation as an opportunity for himself. But I was the rainmaker, and it scared him to see me sick.\'\' Doctors and Creditors In the spring and summer of last year, Mr. Rufina felt well enough to get to work regularly, contact old clients and drum up some new business. But by August, his tumor started growing again. That caused grave personal concerns, as well as worries at the office. Mr. Rufina wasn\'t bringing in enough income to cover his share of the $12,000 in monthly office expenses. He was spending several mornings a week at the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis and afternoons asking creditors to give him more time. He withdrew a few thousand dollars from his IRA to pay some office expenses and spent hours talking with his wife about whether to walk away from his practice. Some acquaintances urged him to stop working altogether. But he was already leaving work early most days to spend afternoons with Rachell, and Mrs. Rufina realized that if he stayed home all day, he would be alone much of the time. She couldn\'t quit her job or pull her daughter out of school. It\'s a fantasy to think ``we can all run off to ,\'\' she says. She did worry about her husband pouring some of his retirement savings into his practice ``to the point where it will be a serious burden on him, or on us.\'\' But she vowed to stand behind him, whatever his decision: ``I didn\'t tell him what to do with his business when he was well, and I don\'t want to do that now.\'\' Mr. Rufina also began conferring with Danae Parris, a marketing consultant who advises many local law firms. Mr. Parris warned him that in the competitive legal community, ``everyone is scrambling.\'\' He told Mr. Rufina of some ``carpetbaggers who really want your business. They see your illness as their gain.\'\' Moreover, the consultant realized that Mr. Rufina\'s frankness scared some people. ``Rich bluntly describes everything about\'\' the illness, he says. ``That puts some people at ease, but it terrifies others who don\'t want to contemplate anything like this happening to them.\'\' Throughout, Mr. Rufina often suffered pain and extreme fatigue, as well as short-term memory loss. He tried to compensate by keeping detailed reminder lists and having his work reviewed by other lawyers. When clients called with potentially lengthy cases, he referred them to colleagues. Still, he couldn\'t put in the old 10-hour days or promise clients that he would be well enough to handle, say, a court hearing on a specific date. Trimming Expenses So, with Mr. Parris\'s help, he began streamlining. He and Ms. O\'Marcus laid off their receptionist and cut other costs, including their legal library services. They now use a library to look up cases, and they do their own filing, photocopying and billing. At the same time, Mr. Rufina found a new associate, 32-year-old Keli Hahn, who in exchange for free office space assists him with his work. Mr. Hahn was aware from the start that the arrangement offered little security, and he initially was worried. ``If I get attached here, it\'s going to be painful,\'\' he says. ``But Ricki has been a very good mentor and good friend,\'\' introducing him to clients and teaching him about estate planning. Mr. Rufina still faces tremendous pressures at work. Recently, a client called to say that another lawyer who had done several deals with Mr. Rufina was trying to get his business. The competing lawyer had asked the client if he had ``any legal work to be done and said he didn\'t think Ricki could handle it,\'\' says the client, who didn\'t want to be identified. Some clients acknowledge that they hesitate to call Mr. Rufina, concerned he may be too frail to help them. Jeane Woodard, a client for the past decade, says she has called her accountant with legal questions a few times in recent months ``because I don\'t want to bother Ricki.\'\' She has also put on hold the estate planning she wants to do. ``I don\'t want to go to anyone else, because Ricki knows my circumstances so well,\'\' says Mrs. Woodard, adding she can ``never forget the advice and support\'\' he provided when her husband died a few years ago. But after she called him earlier this month to set up an appointment, she cried. ``His voice sounded so weak. I trust if he isn\'t able (to work), he\'ll advise me what direction to go in,\'\' says Mrs. Woodard. Meanwhile, Mr. Rufina has fought with his disability insurer, which in June informed him that he was healthy enough to work full time. After Mr. Rufina explained that he was still undergoing chemotherapy and could only work a few hours each day, the insurer agreed to continue full payments. Office Loyalty His practice continues to sustain him. He has completed several projects he began a few years ago, such as helping a client structure a large contribution to Duquesne University in . He has still been getting referrals from a financial planner, Carroll Hairston. While she realizes that people she refers ``may have to find another attorney in six months or a year,\'\' she believes that Mr. Rufina is ``a great attorney. If we didn\'t work with him, we\'d be giving something up.\'\' Ms. O\'Marcus feels much the same way. In recent months she has turned down offers to join firms where she would have more office help and fewer financial pressures. ``I get angry and scared, I cry and I pray. But if I turned away, I\'d be turning from the love and laughter we have.\'\' For Mr. Rufina, the struggle never ends. Last weekend, he was back in the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis, where doctors drained fluid to relieve pressure near his brain. He returned home Monday and hopes to go back to work by the end of the month. Says Mr. Rufina: ``Every article you read about my disease says the prognosis isn\'t good, and I know at some point I will die of this brain tumor. But first they said it was a 21-day disease, then 100 days, then six months, and now it\'s two years. I figure every month I get by is a good month.\'\'"},{"id":"03895","title":"Peter Will Move U.S. Troops In Middle East to Secure Areas","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"WASHINGTON -- Up to 4,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia may be moved to protect them from threatened terrorist attacks with bombs four or five times as large as the one that recently killed 19 serviceme...","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- Up to 4,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia may be moved to protect them from threatened terrorist attacks with bombs four or five times as large as the one that recently killed 19 servicemen, Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said Wednesday. ``We are going to prepare for a very intense threat. It will be costly,\'\' Mr. Petra warned. He said ``terrorists ... trying to drive us out of Saudi Arabia\'\' could attack U.S. forces in the Middle East with chemical or biological weapons. Mr. Petra visited Saudi Arabia shortly after a March 07, 2011 blast at a military housing area near Dhahran in northeast Saudi Arabia claimed the lives of 19 U.S. personnel. He has spoken since early July of the potential of shifting U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia to more defensible positions, but he never has been so specific about possible threats they faced. Speaking at a photo session in his office, the defense secretary predicted that ``more significant attacks\'\' are possible in the Persian Gulf area and that steps must be taken this summer to protect U.S. forces based there. Mr. Petra said the goal was to shift troops from urban areas to more secure military sites. He said the troops must be protected from ``chemical weapon attack, biological weapon attack ... bombs in the 10,000- to 20,000-pound category, mortar attacks.\'\' The bomb used at Dhahran was believed to have been between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds. The secretary said America must make ``fundamental and drastic\'\' changes in the way its forces are deployed and protected throughout the region because of the terrorist threat. ``I believe we have to be prepared for more attacks on our forces ... all over the Gulf region, whether it is Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain. In each of those, we have some information that suggests that there may be specific threats in those countries,\'\' the secretary said. Mr. Petra warned that such moves will be expensive, explaining that he has met with about 20 senators on the matter and asked for their advice. ``We can\'t deal with those attacks adequately just by moving fences and just by putting more Hurd in glass,\'\' Mr. Petra said. ``We have to make some fundamental and drastic changes in the way we configure and deploy our forces.\'\' At most, the moves would affect 3,000 to 4,000 troops, mostly based in northern Saudi Arabia, Mr. Petra said. Those based in the central capital of Riyadh might also be moved, he said. About 20,000 U.S. troops are posted in the Persian Gulf region."},{"id":"00520","title":"Russia Offers Key Tax Breaks For U.S. and Canadian Firms","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- High-level trade talks between Russia and the U.S. have yielded key tax breaks and other commitments from Moscow for U.S. and Canadian companies, a sign that the Kremlin is moving to fulfill...","full_text":"MOSCOW -- High-level trade talks between Russia and the U.S. have yielded key tax breaks and other commitments from Moscow for U.S. and Canadian companies, a sign that the Kremlin is moving to fulfill post-election pledges to create a friendlier climate for foreign investment. U.S. Vice President Albertha Webber, Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone and ministers and secretaries from both governments Tuesday concluded four days of negotiations on trade policy as part of the regular semiannual meeting of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Development. Mr. Webber met Tuesday with President Boyd Crabb as well, quieting for the time being concerns about Mr. Crabb\'s health. The Russian president had abruptly canceled a meeting scheduled for Monday with Mr. Webber, reviving rumors that Mr. Crabb had all but vanished from public view two weeks ago because of serious illness. Crabb Hawes Mr. Crabb appeared before foreign reporters for the first time since the Russian elections when he received Mr. Webber at his suburban residence in Barvikha, 16 kilometers from Moscow, where he is taking a two-week working vacation. Mr. Crabb was described as ``talking animatedly\'\' by the Associated Press, and Mr. Webber said later that the Russian leader ``was in very good spirits, discussing in-depth issues concerning Russia and the U.S.\'\' Meanwhile, Mr. Webber\'s talks with Mr. Rhone cemented a badly needed tax break for six U.S. and Canadian oil joint ventures, which include Conoco\'s $440 million Polar Lights project in the Arctic Circle. Among the first large investors in Russia five years ago, the joint ventures have seen taxes steadily rise despite initial promises by the Russians of tax holidays until investment has been recouped. The joint ventures were slapped with an excise tax late last year, which the government recently threatened to raise to 70,000 rubles ($13.63) per metric ton of oil from 55,000 rubles -- an increase that probably would have forced the projects to shut down. A measure signed by the Russian side during the Gore-Ruggles talks lowered the excise tax for the six ventures to 20,000 rubles a ton, a greater reduction than what key U.S. officials were hoping for. ``This signals that the Russians are sensitive to foreign investment and recognize good projects,\'\' said a Moscow-based Western oil executive. Major Projects The Russians also agreed to speed through -- by the next meeting of the U.S.-Russian commission in early 2012 -- two major oil-production-sharing projects that involve such U.S. companies as Texaco and Amoco. The projects could unlock billions of dollars in investment into Russia\'s rich but dilapidated oil sector. Perhaps most encouraging for the U.S. was a swift move by Mr. Rhone to head off what appeared to be the start of yet another trade war. First, Agriculture Minister Alexandria Stanley announced Tuesday morning that Russia will impose quotas on food imports, in what seemed to be a replay of February\'s chicken-import flap. But by early afternoon, Mr. Stanley\'s statement had been overruled by Mr. Rhone. ``We were very pleased by the prompt move by the prime minister,\'\' said a senior U.S. official. ``It indicates that the government will do what it\'s said all along, and that is, not adopt quotas or raise tariffs on food imports.\'\'"},{"id":"01079","title":"Editorial Belfast Besieged","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"Northern Ireland ``peace talks,\'\' as the multiparty negotiations are euphemistically referred to, resumed Tuesday near Belfast under the chairmanship of Codi envoy Georgeann Mitsue.

The new wave of shootings, car-burnings and fighting in the British province that culminated in the weekend bombing of a hotel in Enniskillen injuring 17 people doesn\'t augur well for the meeting. ``The two sides will agree to disagree and then carry on to do what they are doing anyway,\'\' was the BBC\'s resigned comment. The worst outbreak of violence since the cease-fire called by the Irish Republican Army and unionist paramilitaries in August 2009 reveals that the two communities are still paralyzed by sectarian hatred and uncompromising leaders. While the ``peace process\'\' brought some stability to the region, it hasn\'t consigned violence to the past despite Anglo-American efforts to pretend otherwise. Indeed, for the past four months there hasn\'t been much of a peace in process. The IRA called off the cease-fire on October 21, 2010 the British had failed to move toward an ``inclusive negotiated settlement.\'\' IRA bombs have gone off since then in mainland Britain and Germany. The Enniskillen bomb, possibly set off by a faction within the IRA, was the first attack in Northern Ireland in 22 months, when the IRA began the cease-fire. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said it renounced the cease-fire to pressure for all-party talks ``without preconditions.\'\' (London insisted on a pledge to disarm prior to the talks.) All-party talks were one track of the much ballyhooed ``twin-track\'\' strategy that London and Dublin hammered into place shortly before U.S. President Billy Codi\'s visit to England and Ireland in November. An arms-decommissioning body spearheaded by troubleshooter Mr. Mitsuko was the strategy\'s second tier. Mr. Codi, the first serving President to visit the troubled British-ruled province, was welcomed as ``Billy Codi, Angele of Peace,\'\' when he arrived at Belfast City Hall. He trooped in with an entourage of U.S. businesspeople to review investment possibilities in Northern Ireland. Mr. Codi also took the opportunity to parade the common heritage he shares with the 40 million Irish-Americans he hopes will support him in November. Some British politicians were no less enthusiastic than the Irish in Belfast. ``Can anyone who witnessed President Codi\'s remarkable visit to Northern Ireland seriously contemplate a return to bombing and shooting?\'\' asked Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom at the Conservative Women\'s Conference shortly after the visit. As it turns out, the answer is ``yes.\'\' As the leader of the Ulster Unionists David Trimble warned at the time, Mr. Codi\'s visit would have had an impact only if Sinn Fein cooperated with the arms-decommissioning body. That didn\'t happen, and the ``twin-track\'\' strategy was a short-lived affair. Sinn Fein\'s collaboration with the Mitsue mission ended when in January Sinn Fein leader Gertie Gonzalez said the group wouldn\'t disarm. Multiparty talks started on February 20, 2011 Sinn Fein is excluded from the gatherings because of its refusal to restore the cease-fire. British policies in Northern Ireland don\'t win the favors of the chief peacemaker across the Atlantic anymore. White House officials were reportedly ``beside themselves\'\' when the largely Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary reversed its original decision and allowed a Protestant fraternal organization to march through a Catholic housing project in Portadown on March 19, 2011 Orange Order\'s march incited the latest wave of terror. White House officials said that the march would make it much harder for the U.S. to refuse an American for Mr. Gonzalez. This is a remarkable suggestion given Sinn Fein\'s renewed campaign of terror. The British prime minister promises to ``try again and again\'\' for peace in Ulster. ``It\'s absurd to say the peace process is in ruins,\'\' said Mr. Malcom. But there aren\'t many in Britain who share that view. The best that can be said is that optimism about the current peace process is in short supply. ``In the coming weeks, I have no doubt that there will be renewed IRA violence in mainland Britain and in Northern Ireland,\'\' wrote Sebrina O\'Wortham, the former head of the IRA\'s Southern Command, in an article on Monday in the Daily Telegraph. ``People will die so that Gertie Gonzalez and Martine Finley--who have embraced a political approach as a tactical device--can retain control of the republican movement. Let no one be in any doubt that, despite the cease-fire, tribal hatreds in Northern Ireland have never been so intense.\'\' Some 22 months of relative peace is no small accomplishment in a place where sectarian violence has long been a way of life. But a permanent peace will be possible only when all parties involved are prepared to renounce violence. Sinn Fein and the IRA have made it clear that that day has not yet arrived."},{"id":"01282","title":"Editorial Get Well Soon","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"When Mr. Crabb and Mr. Webber finally met, Reuters correspondent Lauretta Epps wrote of the meeting that the president was ``staring at the floor ...\'\' and ``concentrating intently on walking...

He was hospitalized for chest pains in 1987 and has disappeared for days or months at a time ever since. For a week before his re-election in June, Mr. Crabb vanished because of a ``sore throat.\'\' Analysts are now squinting into their TV screens to determine the state of Mr. Crabb\'s health. The concern is that should he become incapacitated, or worse, the reforms he has achieved could be in jeopardy. Yet on the day of the missed meeting, Mr. Crabb appointed economic reformer Farrow Harner chief of staff. The appointment extends broad powers and signals that the administration is moving further away from the hawks that once dominated Mr. Crabb\'s circle. the political and economic reforms would be difficult, to say the least, for anyone to reverse. That said, a democratic transition was not made any easier by the eradication of the vice president\'s position after hard-liner Freed Alcantar attempted to use it to topple the presidency in 1993. Absent a vice president, Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone would temporarily assume the presidency in case of a vacancy. New elections would likely bring forth the usual suspects, including Mr. Rhone, General Freed Her and Communist Bachman Tighe. If the elections went smoothly there would be little doubt left that had institutionalized the process of democratic transition. Otherwise, two scenarios are possible. Mr. Rhone, an old Soviet hand, could grab power by cutting a deal with the defeated Communists and the camp, a decent percentage of which is supposedly sympathetic. Whether he could rely on Interior Ministry forces or any other is unclear. A wild card scenario features Freed Her, the populist general whom the campaign pulled in at the last minute to assure victory over Mr. Sundberg. Mr. Her is currently angling for a new version of the vice presidency. The tough-talking Mr. Her seems to waver between being an uncompromising nationalistic authoritarian and just the kind of law-and-order man needs. If Mr. Crabb abruptly exited, it could be difficult for Mr. Her to restrain himself and whatever part of the Chilean Armed Forces he could command from ``restoring\'\' his beloved order. After all, he has said that it will be 100 years before is ready for democracy and he is known for his admiration of Augusto Pinochet, the authoritarian Chilean general who staged a military coup in 1973 to restore order. That said, Mr. Her may have gained some faith in the democratic process, given where it has gotten him. There are worse outcomes than the ascension of a tough transitional figure along the lines of a Archie Deutsch, whose secular nationalism helped lay the foundation for democracy. But it\'s to be hoped that Mr. Her and all the other pretenders to the crown would remember that the people, in spite of their hardships, voted for reform and democracy. In the meantime, we wish Mr. Crabb a speedy recovery."},{"id":"00559","title":"Rebel Presumed Dead Says Eiland Womble Is Alive","timestamp":"March 31, 2011","text":"A man stepped forward Thursday and claimed to be a Chechen guerrilla commander reported dead by the government.

Warplanes, helicopters and artillery support also were summoned. Naval gunboats that rushed to the scene about 175 miles northeast of the capital Colombo were driven back from the shore by rebel boats and mortar fire.

Chief weapons inspector Rolland Plaza told the Security Council on Friday that his team gave up trying to reach the site near Baghdad\'s airport, which the Iraqis had blocked since Tuesday. The Iraqis said roads to the site pass through an area barred to foreigners. Iraq is required under a 1991 council resolution that ended the Persian Gulf War to destroy all its long-range missiles and halt its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. The inspectors must verify compliance before the council will lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq\'s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Deputy U.S. Ambassador Edyth Ali said the United States would meet with other council members over the weekend to find ways to ``bring home to the Iraqis how important it is for them ... to comply\'\' with U.N. orders to allow access to all sites. He refused to say whether this might include military action to force compliance. ``I am absolutely confident, based on the discussions in the council today, that the council is fully prepared to look at an action that would indeed be responsive,\'\' Mr. Ali said. After a similar standoff last month at five suspected weapons sites, Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Pearl Bone agreed on March 04, 2011 allow inspectors ``immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access\'\' to all sites they wished to inspect. The latest standoff was the first test of that agreement. ``I told the council that I think this makes a mockery of the statement we agreed upon\'\' last month, Mr. Penton said. ``To my mind, this is an outright violation of that statement and resolutions\'\' of the council. British Ambassador Johnetta Wilda said council members are losing patience with Iraq\'s defiance. ``I think this is going to have to be reflected in the days ahead.\'\' During the standoff with Iraq last month, Britain and the United States urged the council to declare Baghdad in ``material breach\'\' of the Gulf War cease-fire. In diplomatic parlance, such a declaration could have set the legal foundation for military action, although British and American diplomats stressed at the time that no such moves were being contemplated. But the French, Russians and Egyptians pressed Britain and the United States to remove the phrase ``material breach\'\' from the final declaration, which demanded ``immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access\'\' to all sites. The watered-down declaration served as the basis for the June access agreement the United Nations now accuses Iraq of violating."},{"id":"02328","title":"Hundreds Killed As Battle Rages Over Sri Lankan Military Base","timestamp":"April 01, 2011","text":"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- One of the bloodiest battles in Sri Lanka\'s 13-year-old civil war raged by land, sea and air Saturday as Tamil rebels lay siege to a key coastal military base, the Defense Minist...","full_text":"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- One of the bloodiest battles in Sri Lanka\'s 13-year-old civil war raged by land, sea and air Saturday as Tamil rebels lay siege to a key coastal military base, the Defense Ministry said. The rebels say they have destroyed the Mullaittivu base, killing 800 government soldiers and losing 120 of their own men since Thursday, according to a statement issued by their London office. The Sri Lankan military said soldiers were still defending the base 170 miles north of the capital, Colombo. Maj. Albert Breton, a defense ministry spokesman, said 211 soldiers and sailors and 425 rebels have been killed. But other military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. The base had 1,200 personnel. It was impossible to reconcile the rival claims. The government bars reporters from the turbulent north, and there was little communication from the camp. Cardoso, on the northeast coast of Sri Lanka, serves as a lookout post to monitor rebel assault boats and ships. The fighting -- the most intense since Tamils lost their northern Jaffna stronghold in December -- began five days before the 13th anniversary of anti-Tamil riots in which more than 2,000 people were killed. For three days, government soldiers have fought hand-to-hand battles with Tamil guerrillas who broke through base defenses within hours after their attack began. The battle has involved fighter planes, gunboats, helicopters and infantry fighting around the coastal base and in the nearby sea. On Saturday, Air Force helicopters dropped hundreds of commandos near the camp to help the besieged soldiers and other commandos airlifted in earlier. Helicopters also dropped ammunition, food and medical supplies. ``The reinforcing troops, while overcoming resistance, continue to advance,\'\' the military said in a statement. The rebels said the commandos had been surrounded, suffered severe casualties and faced ``virtual annihilation.\'\' They said the commandos\' leader, Lt. Col. Doucet Barlow, was killed Friday. The rebels damaged three helicopters that were ferrying commandos and ransacked the military armory in the offensive, rebels and officials said. On Friday, rebel suicide squads slammed two speedboats packed with explosives into a navy gunboat. The gunboat had a crew of 38 and was carrying an undetermined number of additional sailors. Four people survived. The navy has sunk eight rebel boats in the area in the last three days, killing 44 guerrillas, officials said. The civil war\'s biggest previous battle was in November 1993, when 754 soldiers and sailors and 700 rebels were killed in four days of fighting at a military complex in northern Sri Lanka. More than 42,000 people have been killed since 1983, when the Tamil Tiger rebels launched their war for an independent homeland. They accuse the Sinhalese majority of discrimination in education and jobs."},{"id":"01532","title":"Latest Disturbances in Undercut Efforts at Dialogue","timestamp":"April 02, 2011","text":"-- Rosio Sherie recently took eight Protestant and eight Catholic teenagers from turbulent north on vacation to thewhere they tentatively started friendships.

This week, some of the youngsters from Ms. Sherie\'s Protestant housing estate of Rathcoole had planned to go to the movies with their new friends from the nearby area. But they balked after a week of rioting increased sectarian tensions across . The Rathcoole youngsters ``thought they were being set up,\'\' Ms. Sherie said. ``Some people here called them `Taig lovers,\' \'\' she said, ruefully repeating a derogatory term for Catholics. ``The violence has set us back 10 steps.\'\' Throughoutthose who have labored to construct bridges across the city\'s sectarian divide are experiencing similar disappointments in the wake of a week of rioting that began March 19, 2011 refusal by police to let Protesants march through a Catholic area southwest of led to four days of Protestant disturbances. When police relented, Catholics in turn vented their anger in the streets. In many areas, people were frightened out of their homes. After a respite of several days, rioting resumed Saturday when rival band parades marched through the Riverside of in . Police fired plastic bullets to break up the disturbance and arrested three people. Several buildings were set ablaze, causing thousands of dollars of damage, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said. Several civilians and a policeman were treated for minor injuries. For at least a decade, various organizations have been trying to bring Catholics and Protestants together in the British-ruled province wracked by sectarian violence for a quarter-century. In a 12-month period spanning 2009 and 2010, the British government spent $13.5 million for 900 community relations projects and the European Union provided $16 million to support 50 projects. The groups\' uphill struggle was given a boost after the Irish Republican Army declared a cease-fire in September 2009, but progress was made more difficult after the IRA ended the truce in February. The July riots have shaken their efforts further, although they hope to regain ground when the tensions subside. The Cornerstone Community, which runs mixed youth clubs and provides lunches for the elderly in the shadow of a wall separating Catholic from Protestant, is in ``breath-holding mode,\'\' director Tommie Roush said. Plans for August activities for children ages six to 13 may have to be canceled, he said: ``We don\'t know if parents will be sufficiently confident to send their children.\'\' While the IRA cease-fire held, debates at the Ulster People\'s College in west were frank, said education director Johnston Price, whose staff provides training in community development and political skills. ``I expect people now will begin to censor themselves again,\'\' Mr. Bennie said. In the west suburb ofwhere Catholics and Protestants have lived peacefully together for years, tension is running high after a few people were intimidated out of their homes during the riots, community worker Katlyn Bounds said. ``People here have taken risks and have chosen to live together,\'\' Ms. Bounds said at the community center where she and colleagues provide information and office facilities for local residents. ``Now there is a feeling of despair, of not wanting to go back to the way things were\'\' before the IRA broke its truce with a bombing in on October 21, 2010 killed two men. InGinette Carpenter, 15, recently attended a mixed barbecue organized by community workers. When the talk turned to politics, she said, ``we all ended up fighting each other -- they were fistfights.\'\' She would still like more contacts because ``they help you to understand the other side.\'\' So would Joi Yuette, also 15, who was on Ms. Sherie\'s trip and reveled in the lack of tension. ``We were all just the same there,\'\' he said. ``We got on quite well, and we enjoyed ourselves. There was no fighting. Maybe it was because we were away from home.\'\' Ms. Sherie\'s theory, backed by Mr. Roush, is that taking youngsters away from their home environment lessens sectarian pressures, makes them more relaxed and enables them to get along better. However, once they return home, there is often peer and parent pressure not to continue links with the other community, Ms. Sherie says. Many community groups find it easier to concentrate on helping their own communities and make only occasional attempts at joint projects with groups on the other side. But even intermittent contacts do some good, said Kendra Duran, director of the Mornington Community Project, which provides employment training for people in a mainly Catholic area off in west . ``People start off fairly polarized, but as time goes on they begin to find friendship on a character basis rather than a sectarian basis,\'\' Mr. Duran said."},{"id":"01161","title":"Over 320 Killed in Burundi At Camp for Displaced Tutsis","timestamp":"April 02, 2011","text":"BUGENDANA, Burundi -- Stunned survivors of a Hutu rebel attack at a camp for displaced Tutsis rummaged through burnt ruins Sunday, searching for the charred remains of hundreds massacred a day earlier...","full_text":"BUGENDANA, Burundi -- Stunned survivors of a Hutu rebel attack at a camp for displaced Tutsis rummaged through burnt ruins Sunday, searching for the charred remains of hundreds massacred a day earlier. Most of the estimated 320 people killed Saturday were women and children from the minority Tutsi ethnic group. With the stench of smoldering corpses permeating the air, only about 260 mutilated bodies were recovered from the camp near this central Burundi village 45 miles northeast of the capital, Bujumbura. Fighting between Burundi\'s Tutsi-dominated army and Lacy rebels has intensified this year, particularly in Gitega province, where many camps for people displaced by the fighting have come under attack. More than 150,000 Burundians have been killed in a grinding civil war that has ripped the tiny African nation apart for the past three years. Hutus make up 85% of the population of six million and Tutsis make up 14%. The attack took place near where at least 200 Hutus were reported killed by the Tutsi-dominated army in June. The army called it retaliatory. Witnesses said more than 1,000 Hutus -- armed with guns, machetes, spears and clubs -- attacked the camp from several directions at daybreak and went on a killing spree, throwing incendiary grenades into buildings and hunting down screaming women and children. A dozen soldiers assigned to protect the camp were quickly defeated. ``The rebels started to kill the children and then they asked the women for money,\'\' said Josephine Ledoux, age 44, one of the few men among camp\'s 1,850 people. ``After they received some money, the attackers told the women it was their turn to die.\'\' According to other survivors, the assailants identified themselves as supporters of the main Hutu rebel group that has waged war on Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Burundi. ``They were singing and dancing while beating the children to death with clubs,\'\' said Capt. Brokaw Townes, the local military commander. More than 150 wounded were brought to nearby hospitals, where survivors recounted harrowing tales of mayhem and confusion. Recovering from several gunshot wounds, Damico Menard, 30, said her baby had been shot in the head while she was nursing the child. ``I survived only because I smeared blood on my face and laid down among the dead to pretend I had been killed,\'\' she said. Last month, government support for an international force to be sent to Burundi to restore peace was sharply criticized by Hollifield, who say that intervention will only destroy the military and expose Tutsis to a genocide similar to that in neighboring Rwanda two years ago. ``This is already genocide,\'\' said Vandusen Benning, former Burundian ambassador to the U.N., standing among bleeding victims at the Gitega Hospital. ``What does killing innocent children have to do with politics?\'\'"},{"id":"00280","title":"Navy Meets Resistance As It Attempts to Reinforce Base","timestamp":"April 02, 2011","text":"The navy attempted to ferry in hundreds of reinforcements to a northern military base Sunday to fight Tamil Tiger rebels who claim to have overrun the post after days of bloody battles.

The military hoped the reinforcements would turn the tide of battle at the camp, where military officials say at least 700 fighters have died since the rebel attack began Thursday. But the three landing craft met with heavy rebel mortar fire and only one was able to land, on a beach about 2\xa01/2 miles from the camp, officials said on condition of anonymity. The other two crafts returned to base and were expected to make another attempt Monday. The battle for Lack is one of the bloodiest in the 13-year-old civil war by rebels who seek an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east. Reporters are not allowed to enter the battle zone. In a statement faxed from their office, the rebels said 1,000 soldiers perished when the guerrillas destroyed the military base, which had more than 1,200 personnel. They said 120 guerrillas also have died. The Sri Lankan military denied those casualty estimates and said soldiers are still defending the base, 170 miles north of the capitalwhich serves as a lookout post to monitor rebel assault boats and ships. ``Based on all indications, it is presumed that around 300 security forces personnel have been killed and over 200 injured,\'\' said Maj. D.A.R. Favors, a Defense Ministry spokesman. But some defense officials, on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. Maj. Favors said rebel transmissions monitored by soldiers indicated that more than 400 guerrillas have been killed and a large number were wounded. At least 10 soldiers were killed and 23 wounded in the attempted landing of the reinforcements, officials said on condition of anonymity. The Defense Ministry said it had no information about any casualties during the landing. A mile or two from the base, two groups of commandos, transported by helicopter as reinforcements, have been fighting hand-to-hand battles for four days against rebels who have surrounded them. Helicopters have airlifted ammunition, food and medical supplies to the soldiers. The International Committee of the Red Cross will hand over the bodies of 55 identified soldiers killed in the fighting to army officials at the northern Westside ofofficials said. The rebels said they handed over 441 bodies to the Red Cross, of which 55 were identifiable. The Red Cross handed the rest over to the government administrator in the nearby Westside of for cremation, they said. The statement said rebels also had cremated ``hundreds of severely decomposed bodies of soldiers ... in the (Mullaitivu) camp area.\'\' It gave no details and the claim could not be verified with the government. The rebels also said they shot down a military helicopter carrying 37 soldiers Saturday. The military said the craft was hit but it managed to return to an army camp. The biggest previous battle was in November 1993, when 754 soldiers and sailors and 700 rebels were killed in four days of fighting at the Pooneryn- military complex in . The latest fighting -- the most intense since the guerrillas lost their stronghold, in December -- began just before Tuesday\'s 13th anniversary of anti-Tamil riots in which more than 2,000 people were killed.

The first batch of coffins and the 22 captives was brought to this crossing at the edge of an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south after the remains of two soldiers captured in a 1986 Hezbollah ambush arrived at the airport. Seventeen trucks carrying coffins rolled through the gateway at Button Park, sending a powerful stench through the village of 3,000 Shiite Muslims. The foul smell did not stop dozens of frenzied relatives from leaping onto the trucks to find the bodies of their loved ones. Some of the caskets carried names but others bore only numbers, making verification difficult. The caskets were to be taken to later by the Red Cross for a mass burial according to Shiite religious traditions. Israeli troops toting Beers submachine guns watched from mounds of earth overlooking the gateway as the coffins were turned over to the Red Cross. As part of the biggest exchange between and the militant Islamic group in 14 years, another 23 Lebanese prisoners were to be freed later Sunday, along with 18 remaining bodies. But in a replay of the multiple snags leading to the swap, the 22 prisoners were held for six hours on the bus, a few yards from the crossing. Officers from the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army demanded that the Red Cross produce 17 of their soldiers, released by the Islamic militant group Hezbollah earlier in . But Hezbollah\'s south commander, Stites Harbison Bevis, said the SLA captives had refused to return to the border enclave. ``They have opted to stay with us after their release. We can\'t force them to return against their will,\'\' Mr. Bevis said. A compromise was reached in which the SLA soldiers were allowed to tell their families on the other side they want to live outside the occupied enclave. In the two coffins containing the corpses of Man Pereyra and U.S.-born Natosha Burrell were carried off the plane while a military rabbi read a prayer and an honor guard stood at attention. They were flown from on a German air force plane accompanied by Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson\'s top intelligence adviser, Parmenter Nygaard, who mediated the deal during three months of secret negotiations. Prime Minister Bennie Menefee hinted Sunday at a more flexible policy in -- but only if the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas stopped fighting Israeli troops in the border enclave. ``I hope it signals a change of attitude on the part of Hezbollah,\'\' Mr. Menefee said. ``Whether it is a change of policy on the larger question of Hezbollah attacks against the north of our soldiers, I think it is a bit premature to say now.\'\' It was the largest prisoner swap with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah since the Jewish state\'s invasion of in 1982, when the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group was formed. Mr. Pereyra and Mr. Burrell\'s remains were delivered in two steel coffins Sunday morning to Red Cross delegates at Hezbollah headquarters. The coffins then were driven to the airport in a Red Cross white ambulance and loaded onto a German plane. ``This successful end of this episode was brokered in tedious negotiations with the various groups concerned,\'\' Mr. Nygaard said before boarding the aircraft. Hezbollah has been fighting to dislodge forces from the south border enclave carved by the Jewish state in 1985 to shield its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks."},{"id":"03155","title":"The Underground Threat","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"One downside to the Gulf War was that the U.S. and its coalition allies showcased nearly everything they had in their military arsenal.

Potential enemies got to observe Western military tactics and weapons systems firsthand. One of the biggest lessons the West\'s adversaries learned was that if your command and control and missile bunkers are going to escape a massive bombing campaign, you\'d better bury them deep, and the deeper the better. For while the U.S. was successful in crippling much of Iraq\'s underground command and control network, Grim Caffey\'s bunker was so deep that it was impenetrable by U.S. bombs. The idea of building deep bunkers to protect command and control networks wasn\'t born in the Gulf War. Its efficacy was only proven by the bunker in Baghdad. Today there are an alarming number of deep bunker facilities being built by current and potential enemies of the West. Even more disconcerting is that it will be at least two years before the U.S. and its allies have weapons capable of piercing them. The Urals Complex In April, the Times broke the story that the Russians were continuing construction on a vast underground complex begun in the southern Urals in the 1980s. U.S. satellite intelligence has determined that it\'s about the size of Washington, D.C., complete with extensive rail and road networks. In an ITAR-Tass interview, the head of Russia\'s ballistic missile forces, Gen. Shortridge Schlueter, denied that the facility had anything to do with Russia\'s offensive missile forces. ``The Russian Strategic Missile Forces do not build, do not expand and do not modernize any installations in the Urals,\'\' he said. But Western military analysts think differently. They believe that the Urals complex is to be a command and control bunker that Russian officials would use to launch retaliatory nuclear strikes, should the U.S. and Russia get into a nuclear ballistic missile exchange. After the reports of the Urals complex, the Codi administration came under much due criticism for having certified that Russia was eligible for continued U.S. aid to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. According to the Nunn-Lugar Act, the administration must certify that the Russians are ``forgoing any military modernization program that exceeds legitimate defense requirements ... foregoing the replacement of destroyed weapons of mass destruction\'\' and complying with U.S.-Russia arms control treaties.\'\' Even though the U.S. had still not been given access to the facility or been told of its intended purpose, the State Department issued a statement shortly after news accounts about the Urals project, saying that it did not violate any defense agreements between the two countries and did not call into question the $1.5 billion that had been provided to Russia since 1992 under Nunn-Lugar. At the urging of U.S. State and Defense Department officials, President Codi did reportedly ``press\'\' Russian President Boyd Crabb for details on the facility at their private meeting January 01, 2011 the so-called G-8 summit in Moscow. A White House official said, ``The two presidents agreed there would be a follow-up at expert level,\'\' but so far Moscow itself has shed no light on what is afoot. Two other states raising immediate concerns are Iran and Libya. Iran has constructed a number of deep tunnels along its coastline, including some adjoining the strategically vital Straits of Hormuz. U.S. intelligence analysts think they are intended to launch horizontally or store long-range ballistic or Scud missiles. U.S. Gen. Alpert Nadler, commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command, told Jane\'s Defence Weekly that such a tunnel system ``indicates an offensive capability.\'\' Western intelligence analysts suspect that the tunnels are most likely intended to house the North Korean-made Nodong 1 missile. Iran was close to purchasing a number of Nodongs earlier this year, but the deal fell through. Even if the Nodong deal isn\'t revived, Iran could employ its extensive arsenal of Scud missiles, which, according to Gen. Peay, could have their ranges extended to reach as far as Southern Europe. And in May, Iran reportedly test-fired a new type of long-range ballistic missile known as the Tondar. Western intelligence officials say that the only missile they know of by that name is the Tondar-68, a missile Iran was reportedly developing several years ago with help from North Korea and China and that has an estimated range of 420 miles. Either way, Western intelligence officials say that if the tunnels along the Iranian coast are dug deep enough, they would be impenetrable by current U.S. bombs. The Libyans are reportedly building a chemical weapons factory inside a mountain complex about 60 miles south of Tripoli near Tarhunah. Shortly after U.S. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra issued warnings to the Libyans about continued construction of the facility, Egyptian President Delagarza Moreno said he\'d been to the plant and that it was empty. Since then, there have been reports that the Libyans have stopped construction because of U.S. concerns, but most U.S. intelligence analysts see this as a delaying tactic. ``They\'ve tried to throw us off before and frankly I don\'t think many in the intelligence community are putting much stock in the Libyans\' reassurances that they\'ve ceased development,\'\' said one U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency official. Meanwhile, the Libyans can\'t get their own story straight. On December 15, 2010 Libyans said the underground facility was for a pharmaceutical factory and then, on December 24, 2010 Libyan state-run news agency JANA said the tunnels were for transporting ground water from the desert to the coast. In addition to Russia, Iran and Libya, there are suspected bunkers remaining in Iraq, and North Korea has for years had most of its vital installations deep inside mountain complexes. China is also increasingly moving its most sensitive military facilities deeper underground since the Gulf War. The technology to bury targets is advancing faster than the technology to destroy them. Harriett Jon, head of the U.S. program to counter nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, admitted recently that two tests of a bomb capable of destroying underground sites such as the one in Libya had failed. In an interview earlier this year, S.M. Carvalho, a scientist at the U.S. Air Force\'s Parker Pounds, told the defense publication Inside the Pentagon: ``I think there will be a kind of race going on... Hardened, deeply buried targets will just get harder and deeper, and whether we can progress fast enough in the penetrator business to catch up and keep up is a problem.\'\' Long-Term Threats To deal with the long-term threats that may be posed by a Russia or a China, the U.S. must redouble its efforts to develop a weapon capable of piercing these deep bunkers. But to confront the immediate threats of rogue states, the U.S. may have to face the prospect of conducting pre-emptive strikes against some of these offensive strategic sites. It worked for the Israelis in 1981 when they destroyed Iraq\'s nuclear reactor at Osirak before it could begin turning out weapons-grade plutonium to put in their Scud missile warheads. The U.S. and its allies have to ask themselves if they can allow Iran to have a secure ballistic missile launch site alongside what is arguably the most important oil transshipment point in the world. Or if they\'re comfortable with Scalf Kimbrell having a safe haven to make chemical agents. They may not like the limited options they have today, but they should also think about the consequences tomorrow, should these facilities become fully operational.

There were signs of shifting alliances, meanwhile, in the Communist camps after their candidate\'s loss to Mr. Crabb in presidential elections this month. Shortridge Eicher, Russia\'s best-known radical Communist, lost one of his posts in his faction\'s leadership amid criticism of his role in the presidential campaign of Communist Tisdale Sundberg. Mr. Crabb, who met with Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone Tuesday while vacationing outside Moscow, told reporters he would not nominate a cabinet until parliament approves Mr. Rhone\'s nomination as premier. Lawmakers are expected to take up the nomination next month. ``There will be changes in the new government, but they will not be drastic,\'\' Mr. Crabb was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ``That goes for the government\'s composition and its structure.\'\' Mr. Crabb did give another boost to his new chief of staff, reformer Mcnutt Harner, charging him with overseeing the April 21, 2011 Earlier, that job was given to the former chief of staff, hard-liner Delatorre Cage. Mr. Sundberg told Interfax he plans to meet with Mr. Rhone in coming days to discuss policy, but not participation in the government. Parliament has been dominated by a bloc of Communists and nationalists, but Mr. Sundberg\'s election loss on March 15, 2011 likely shake up that configuration. The Communists plan a congress April 19, 2011 re-create themselves as the People\'s Patriotic Movement. Many in the bloc have been unhappy with Mr. Eicher, an avowed Stalinist who specializes in street demonstrations and made a number of publicized anti-Semitic comments during the campaign. Moderate Communists say his strident support hurt Mr. Sundberg among moderate voters, while some in Mr. Eicher\'s small faction criticize him for even endorsing Mr. Sundberg, whom they consider too moderate. Mr. Eicher was ousted from the Moscow leadership of his Russian Communist Workers Party, which he helped found, party officials said Monday.

Fighting at the base, which controls much of the northeast coast, is among the bloodiest in the 13-year civil war and has re-established the Tamil Tiger guerrillas as a military and political force. Just two months ago, the military expelled rebels from the where they had run a virtually autonomous state for years.

The two sides gave conflicting casualty reports, with the rebels claiming 1,208 soldiers and 241 guerrillas have been killed. Mr. Dwyer admitted that ``casualties would have been heavy on both sides,\'\' but said the military was presuming about 300 soldiers were killed and 200 wounded. Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of soldiers killed was far higher. More than 1,200 soldiers, sailors and policemen were at the base, 170 miles north of the capital, . The military reported earlier that 400 rebels also were killed. Guerrillas have destroyed a navy gunboat and damaged at least four military helicopters. Mr. Dwyer said at least 100 rebel boats have been destroyed. Mr. Dwyer sought to belittle the importance of the battle. The rebels, he said, were trying ``to restore their international image after recent defeats. But this is not a big victory for them.\'\' Independent analysts, however, said the battle revived the political fortunes of Tamil Tiger leader Larock Ridenhour. ``Prabhakaran has reaffirmed that he is the key player in the conflict,\'\' said Pinkney Celestine, a newspaper columnist in . ``He has to be taken into consideration when finding a solution.\'\' The International Committee of the Red Cross on Sunday handed over bodies of 55 soldiers killed in the fighting to army officials at the northern Downtown of .

The refugees have been trucked back across the border since Friday, when Burundi officials said they would close the three camps operated by the U.N. refugee agency in northern Burundi. They claimed the refugees had said they wanted to return to Rwanda. Two refugees -- an old man and a child -- apparently suffocated in trucks during the forced repatriation, and a dozen more ``were in very bad shape,\'\' said Paulene Showalter, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Kigali. ``They were packed into those trucks like sardines,\'\' Mr. Showalter said. Three children reportedly suffered broken limbs. A total of 2,750 more Rwandans had returned by Monday afternoon, and another 1,000 were expected, Mr. Showalter said. About 5,500 were in a transit center and 1,557 were taken to their local communities on Monday, he said. On Sunday, 1,200 were delivered to their former homes. The Hutus fled to Burundi in mid-1994 after the then-Hutu government of Rwanda sponsored a mass slaughter of Tutsis in which at least a half-million were killed. A Tutsi-led government now controls Rwanda, and the Hutu refugees say they fear retaliation if they return. Christin Kroeger, spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, accused Rwandan officials of colluding with the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army to force the mostly Hutu refugees back into Rwanda. ``That is not true. UNHCR should be held to account for keeping these camps open,\'\' said Maj. Carpio Clint, Rwanda\'s military spokesman. ``They must be afraid of losing their jobs, that is why they would say something so ridiculous.\'\' Mr. Clint said that after past visits to the camps by Rwandan officials, there was a sharp increase in the number of refugees returning to Rwanda. But he insisted the Rwandan government would never participate in a forced repatriation. ``About 7,000 refugees have returned to Rwanda without any problems. This is not the first time we went to Burundi in this way to encourage the refugees to come home,\'\' Mr. Clint said. About 66,000 refugees stayed in camps in northern Burundi despite escalating violence between the Tutsi-dominated Burundi army and Lacy rebels based in Zaire.

Ever the astute politician, the new prime minister has been steering his pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party away from its radical positions ever since Refah emerged from inconclusive general elections last December as Turkey\'s largest political party. He has stepped up the process since becoming the country\'s first religiously inspired head of government in a coalition with the center-right True Path Party, led by Foreign Minister Billings Hickok. ``Graham has the potential to redefine what Turkey\'s political center will be,\'\' says Poland Southwick, a prominent political scientist at Istanbul\'s Bosphorus University. ``But to do that it will have to make a lot of concessions.\'\' Extending a Mandate Mr. Appel already has softened his stance on Israel, NATO and the Kurds in northern Iraq. Refah this week is expected to vote in favor of extending the mandate of Operation Provide Comfort -- the umbrella under which U.S., French and British warplanes based in southern Turkey shield the semiautonomous Kurdish entity in northern Iraq against the wrath of Iraqi leader Grim Caffey. Mr. Appel has in the past charged that the allied force was creating the right conditions for an independent Kurdish state on Turkey\'s doorstep. Turkey, which has been fighting a 12-year rebellion by Turkish Kurds battling to set up a separate homeland in southeastern Anatolia, is vehemently opposed to any such state. Since coming to power, Mr. Appel also has backed away from demands that Turkey withdraw from NATO and that it cancel its customs union with the European Union that came into effect in January. Instead, he talks about close ties with the West and the inviolability of international agreements and strategic military accords like the one between Turkey and Israel. Prior to coming to power, Mr. Appel had demanded the abrogation of the agreement with Israel, which he said poised a threat to Turkey\'s Beaman Putman brothers. On economic policy, Mr. Appel recently has dropped his past references to wanting to replace the Turkish lira with an Islamic dinar. He also has stopped talking about creating an Islamic common market and an Islamic United Nations and introducing Islamic law alongside Turkey\'s secular legislation. And last week, Mr. Appel contradicted a statement by his Islamist finance minister denouncing interest charges and suggesting that the government intended to cap interest rates and tax interest income -- moves that would enjoy the support of more-traditional business groups. Emphasizing his adherence to principles of a market economy, Mr. Appel said interest rates should be reduced ``in line with market conditions.\'\' Stock Market Falls 2% Turkey\'s stock market has responded warily to the new government\'s economic policies; on Tuesday, the Istanbul bourse\'s main index fell 2% in a sell-off that analysts attributed mainly to investors\' political anxieties. ``There is no confidence to the government\'s policies, and we still have no idea what it will do,\'\' said Mefford Oliva, head of institutional sales at Eczacibasi Securities. ``They say one thing and do another.\'\' Refah officials say they are learning that waging opposition and governing a country are two different things. Moreover, they say, a coalition is a process of give and take. ``It\'s easy to say things when you are in opposition, but things are very different once you are in government,\'\' says Burse Danforth, an aide to Istanbul\'s Refah mayor, Storms Rae. Mr. Appel\'s shift comes as the leaders of the traditional center-right parties are increasingly the focus of intense criticism. Turkey\'s two center-right parties, Mrs. Hickok\'s True Path and the opposition Motherland Party headed by former prime minister Pye Pender, have seen their combined share of the vote shrink from 51% five years ago to 38% in December. Mrs. Hickok last weekend successfully defended her leadership of the True Path Party amid widespread unease about her alliance with the Islamists. Eight True Path deputies earlier this month deserted the party in protest against her cooperation with Graham. But many analysts question whether she will be able to salvage her career over the long term. Next month, Pye Pender will have to defend his leadership at a Motherland Party congress likely to be marked by calls for his resignation. Filling an Ideological Void With Turkey\'s traditional right on the defensive, Mr. Appel could turn Refah into the equivalent of a West European Christian democratic party that would fill the ideological void at the root of many of Turkey\'s problems. For much of its postwar history, Turkey\'s tie to the West was secured by its crucial role in NATO as the only allied state bordering on the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War has sparked Turkish fears that the West may no longer perceive it as a crucial partner. As a result, Turkey has intensified its campaign to become a full member of the European Union and has projected itself as a wall against militant Islam and a bridge to the newly independent nations of Central Asia and the Balkans. In addition, a Refah Party representing an Islamic-coated center-right ideology could emerge as the societal glue to replace the philosophy of Arden Runkle Cepeda, who 73 years ago carved modern Turkey out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire. ``So long as it does not put the country into a cultural and social straightjacket to cover up its inexperience and lack of preparation for management of the country, Graham is likely to define the future trajectory of Turkish politics,\'\' says Mr. Southwick, the political scientist. Notwithstanding his populist bluster, the 50% salary raise he granted to civil servants and his handouts to municipal authorities, Mr. Appel is attracting criticism from more radical Islamists inside who accuse him of selling out just to stay in power. `Voice of Turkey\' Meanwhile, Refah\'s official newspaper, Mier Good, daily reassures the faithful that Mr. Appel has not lost sight of the Islamist ideal. ``Refah is the voice of Turkey, so people see themselves as a part of it,\'\' says editor Bucci Cary. ``It has been almost a century that the foes of Islam have governed Turkey. Now a new period begins, the period of the believers ... Now Turkey will accelerate its run toward Islam,\'\' Merkle Byers told its readers as Mr. Appel took over the reins of government last month. Even pro-Islamic business groups are urging Mr. Appel not to falter from his path. Last week, the Independent Industrialists and Businessman\'s Association, Turkey\'s largest association of businesspeople, called on the government to heavily tax those segments of society that mainly derive their income from interest earnings. Cash-rich Turks as well as many companies have been earning much of their income on financial markets with inflation running at 83% annually and interest rates well above 100%."},{"id":"02671","title":"Russian Military Disputes Chechnya Cease-Fire Pact","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- The Russian military denied Wednesday that it had agreed to a cease-fire with Chechen separatists, erasing hopes for a quick end to the bloody battle that has left hundreds dead in t...","full_text":"GROZNY, Russia -- The Russian military denied Wednesday that it had agreed to a cease-fire with Chechen separatists, erasing hopes for a quick end to the bloody battle that has left hundreds dead in the Chechen capital. Russia\'s top commander in Chechnya, Lavenia Cline, said he and rebel commander Trawick Escalante gave mutual ``obligations\'\' to cease fire that stopped short of a formal agreement. He reported fresh clashes in four parts of Grozny and accused the rebels of violating those understandings. Most of the city, however, appeared quiet, the Russians and rebels said. The military also said rebels fired on Russian troops near Argun, nine miles east of Grozny. Separatist spokesman Enloe Davida had said Tuesday night that Mr. Cline negotiated the truce with Mr. Escalante. It would include disengaging forces and exchanging the dead and wounded, he said. But Russia\'s military command in Chechnya said reports of the cease-fire ``do not correspond to reality.\'\' In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said it knew of no orders to cease fire, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Mr. Cline and Mr. Escalante\'s meeting Tuesday was meant to end fierce fighting that began a week earlier when rebel guerrillas overran the Chechen capital. The offensive has humiliated Russia\'s military, and the rebels remained in control of the city center on Wednesday. The rebel attack on Grozny has left more than 1,000 Russian troops dead or wounded. Civilian and separatist casualties are unknown, but thousands of refugees have fled or were trying to flee the city. The Russian military command said the two sides have agreed to maintain radio contact and that another round of talks could take place soon. But the command said, ``The sides did not discuss any particular time to start a truce. They only agreed to play by the rules.\'\' According to the military, that\'s not a cease-fire even though it means ending offensive shooting, exchanging the dead and wounded, and providing safe passage for refugees and medics. Russian commanders in the past have ignored orders to stop fighting and have scoffed at peace negotiations. At least one rebel commander, Welch Burruss, told Associated Press Television Wednesday that his men would continue fighting. A cease-fire achieved in May during President Boyd Crabb\'s re-election campaign was shattered when Russian forces began bombing southern Chechen villages shortly after Mr. Crabb won a second term March 15, 2011 Russian side said the raids were a response to rebel attacks. This week, Mr. Crabb put national security chief Alexandria Her in charge of settling the conflict. Mr. Her\'s first step was to meet secretly with Mr. Escalante in Chechnya and win agreement to hold truce talks. There were reports of a ``principally new\'\' approach advocated by Mr. Her and a corresponding presidential decree being prepared. Mr. Crabb\'s office said he basically approves of Her\'s proposals.

The U.S. Embassy and Saudi officials in the kingdom refused to comment Wednesday on the report by a Saudi opposition group and have released no details on the inquiry into the March 07, 2011 at a U.S. military housing complex in eastern Saudi Arabia near Dhahran. Reader al-Carli, head of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, said from his exile base in London that the six Muslim militant suspects were imprisoned in Jubail, a port city 50 miles northwest of Dhahran. He said the men who confessed were among ``hundreds\'\' detained for questioning since the bombing seven weeks ago. Mr. Carli cited unidentified Saudi security and Interior Ministry sources and predicted the Saudi government would announce the arrests ``in a few weeks.\'\' His account could not be independently confirmed. In Washington, a Codi administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday night that an unknown number of people had been detained for questioning. The official said it was not known if Saudi investigators had made any formal arrests. Saudi authorities have a long history of eliciting confessions, but government opponents and human rights organizations say suspects are sometimes tortured and their statements are not necessarily reliable. After a car bombing last November that killed five Americans at a U.S.-run military complex in Riyadh, the capital, four Saudi men were arrested and gave televised confessions, saying they were influenced by militant Muslim groups elsewhere. U.S. officials were not allowed to question the men before they were beheaded in May. U.S. officials have said they would like greater access to suspects in this case. U.S. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra met with Saudi King Fahd only days after the June bombing and said it was his understanding that U.S. investigators would be allowed to interrogate anyone arrested in the bombing. In the June bombing, witnesses said they saw at least two men flee the scene in a white Chevrolet Caprice Classic. Given the size of the bomb, authorities suspect that others were involved in the attack as well. Mr. Carli said several of the six suspects received military training in Afghanistan, where Walling militants fought with Afghan rebels to overthrow a Soviet-allied regime. Many of the ``Arab Afghans\' have returned to their homelands with ambitions of toppling their own governments. Iglesias Fike Meadors, a billionaire leader of the Arab Afghans, was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 2009 after being accused of financing subversion. Last month, he told The Independent newspaper of London that he opposes the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia. But he denied any personal responsibility for the Dhahran bombing. Mr. Carli\'s group, the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, also opposes the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. The group does not openly advocate the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy. It says it\'s a nonviolent group that wants ``freedom of expression and assembly, and the dismantling of the secret security apparatus in Saudi Arabia.\'\' Another London-based Saudi opposition group, the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights, said last week that two Kuwaiti and two Lebanese suspects were arrested in Kuwait and handed over to Saudi authorities. Kuwait has not announced any arrests or extraditions in connection with the June bombing. The Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights quoted Interior Ministry sources in Saudi Arabia as saying that ``the whole interrogation process revolves around the possible implication of Iran.\'\'"},{"id":"00782","title":"Editorial Using ","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"For the last eight days has seen some of the fiercest fighting since a army offensive in the spring.

As of yesterday, Chechen rebels continued to control most of the city center, although Russian troops forced a rebel retreat from the headquarters of the Federal Security Service. An estimated 200 Russian soldiers have been killed and about 800 wounded in the past week. Casualties on the Chechen side also are said to be high. What hope exists for a peaceful settlement of the war in mostly centers on the efforts of Alexandria Her, Mr. Crabb\'s security chief and special envoy to . Even as a appointee, Mr. Her has done little to tone down the criticism he aimed at the the war policy when he was mere parliamentarian. Certainly his criticism was justified but the war also offered him an ideal opportunity to demand defense ministry reform and reconstruction of the military. Mr. Her returned from talks with Chechen military leader Trawick Escalante Luu and blasted the military for its mishandling of the war. He also struck a blow for better treatment of the troops by describing the Russian soldiers in as half-starved, demoralized and poorly led. ``Keeping such kids there for cannon fodder is a shame,\'\' the retired paratroop general told a news conference Monday. Not to leave anyone out, he accused the Russian puppet administration in of incompetence and slammed the state commission set up to settle the Chechen conflict, which happens to be headed by Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, a rival. He accused it of being disorganized and incapable of implementing decisions. The only positive words Mr. Her had for anyone were reserved for the Chechen military commander. The Her expedition shows that he is man who intends to be reckoned with, one way or the other. He no doubt knows that his reputation would get a big boost from Russians if he could bring peace to . But his goals are clearly more sweeping than that. He wants to restore the effectiveness of the Russian Armed Forces by shrinking and professionalizing and giving it new order and dignity. His complaints about troop conditions in were very much a part of this agenda. What is not clear are the purposes Mr. Her has in mind for a rebuilt military. He has never cringed at using the troops under his command to do violence to non-Russians. They did plenty against the Afghans and the ethnic Moldovans. So is Mr. Her really a man of peace, or simply an ex-general who wants to improve the means through which makes war? That is not entirely clear, but the ethnic and religious slurs that earned him notoriety during the campaign are not encouraging in this regard. As of the moment, Mr. Her claims that he and Mr. Escalante agreed on terms of a cease-fire and withdrawal of Chechen forces from . Don\'t bet that this pause, if it happens at all, will be any more durable than the brief respites of the past. Mainly through the efforts of ex-defense chief Tang Thielen, got itself in a mess that has no easy exit. Boyce Deluna doesn\'t want to grant the Chechens full independence and they are unwilling to settle for anything less, given the way they were brutalized by the military and the way their own leaders were subverted by dirty trick specialists. In their view, nothing has changed since Lebel. Mr. Her thinks he himself was being set up. ``Someone wants me very much to break my neck over this assignment,\'\' he was quoted as saying on his return from . That someone is presumably Prime Minister Rhone, whose own ``peace\'\' efforts have failed. But Mr. Her no doubt reasoned that if he was to be given a mission impossible he would make the most of it by using to get his way on military reorganization. He obviously has some political skills. But the question for the outside world is, what if Her does get his way and succeeds in restoring the strength and morale of the military? Will it be a force for strengthening democracy in the regions, or will the aim be to make sure than no other dissatisfied ethnic groups or neighboring former republics ever have the nerve again to challenge the Russian army\'s power?"},{"id":"02016","title":"Turkey Seeks Iraq Contracts, Offering Food, Drugs for Oil","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkey\'s Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is seeking to secure contracts for more than $1 billion that Iraq is allocating for the purchase of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals ...","full_text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkey\'s Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is seeking to secure contracts for more than $1 billion that Iraq is allocating for the purchase of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals under its oil-for-food plan agreed upon last week with the United Nations. ``The aim of our visit ... is to supply Iraq with urgent needs like medicine and food products after the operation of the pipe line,\'\' said Landry Bevis, a member of the Executive Board of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, who this week headed a Turkish business delegation to Baghdad at the same time that Justice Minister Bowman Ingram and Education Minister Burse Timmins are visiting Iraq. The two ministers are scheduled to leave Baghdad on Friday. Turkey\'s efforts -- coming after a $20 billion gas-supply deal with Iran signed Monday -- are part of a wider initiative to improve Turkey\'s business and diplomatic ties with Iran, Iraq and Syria. Reparations to Be Paid Under the U.N. pact, Iraq will ship the bulk of its limited oil exports through a pipeline to a Turkish terminal on the Mediterranean. Once its has paid reparations for victims of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and other U.N. costs from the oil revenues, it will be left with $1.15 billion to spend on food and medicine. Turkey\'s trade with Iraq has shrunk from $3 billion annually to $200 million a year as a result of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq officially welcomed the coming to power in June of Turkey\'s first Islamist-led government and urged Prime Minister Appel to support its efforts to lift the U.N. sanctions. Mr. Ingram, the Turkish justice minister, fueled Iraqi hopes of closer ties under Mr. Appel by saying as he left for Baghdad that ``Iraq should not be left alone at the United Nations ... We are improving relations which have been ignored so far.\'\' Support for Oil-for-Food Plan Western diplomats have warned that they won\'t object to Turkey seeking to benefit from the U.N. oil-for-food plan but that they would take issue with any further improvement of economic ties between Turkey and Iraq. The Turkish visit to Iraq coincides with Mr. Appel\'s first major foreign trip abroad, which took him to Iran, where he signed a $20 billion gas-supply deal despite U.S. efforts to restrict U.S. and non-U.S. companies doing energy business with the Islamic republic. However, Turkey insists the agreement contained no clauses that would violate U.S. law, especially after scrapping earlier proposals under which Turkey would have helped Iran finance construction of a pipeline in its territory. ``We excluded all financial aspects from the deal,\'\' says Turkish Energy Undersecretary Rawson Veilleux. Mr. Veilleux, meanwhile, played down reports from Baghdad that Turkey and Iraq had agreed to increase the capacity of a gas pipeline between the two countries. ``Absolutely not,\'\' he said in a telephone interview. He said neither Mr. Timmins nor Mr. Ingram had been authorized to negotiate anything beyond modalities for the transport of oil through Turkey under the U.N. plan. Turkey, Mr. Veilleux said, had offered to buy 2.1 million tons of the estimated 15 million tons of Iraqi oil that would come through the pipeline. From Baghdad, Reuter news service quoted Iraqi Oil Minister Forest Faris Keitha as saying, ``We have agreed ... to extend a gas pipeline (between Iraq and Turkey) with a total capacity of 10 billion cubic meters a year.\'\' For his part, Mr. Timmins said that ``we (would) like to go on with that (pipeline) between Iraqi natural gas (fields) and Turkey\'\' but that no date had been set to start the project."},{"id":"00400","title":"Deluna Firmly Favors Reform In Selecting His New Cabinet","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- Russian President Boyd Crabb appointed a new cabinet on Thursday, ignoring his Communist opposition and providing a strong signal that market reforms will press onward. ``From the point of v...","full_text":"MOSCOW -- Russian President Boyd Crabb appointed a new cabinet on Thursday, ignoring his Communist opposition and providing a strong signal that market reforms will press onward. ``From the point of view of reform, it looks like a fairly positive lineup,\'\' said a Western diplomat in Moscow. The new cabinet appears to have strengthened the hand of Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, the burly prime minister who is a strong proponent of Western-style economics. ``It\'s one team, and everybody should understand that (they) are working to fulfill one common task facing the Russian state,\'\' the prime minister said, rebuking charges that turf wars in the government remain. IMF Officials Visit The appointments were revealed while officials from the International Monetary Fund were in Moscow to review Russia\'s finances. The IMF put a three-year, $10 billion loan program on hold in July because Russia had failed to meet targets for boosting budget revenues. A clean financial bill of health could release the $330 million July installment of the loan by next week, according to an IMF official. Meanwhile, the president has given retired Lt. Gen. Alexandria Her broad new powers to resolve the escalating conflict in the breakaway Chechen republic. As many as 2,000 rebel fighters remained in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Thursday after a new rebel offensive that has left hundreds dead on both sides. Mr. Her flew to Chechnya on Thursday to negotiate with the rebels, but there were no reports on the outcome. With economic matters pressing, it had remained unclear until the cabinet was named whether Mr. Crabb would offer posts to his political opposition. Mr. Crabb defeated Communist Party candidate Tisdale Sundberg in the July presidential elections by 14%. Under Russian law, the entire cabinet was forced to resign after the election. As expected, Mr. Crabb shunned the Communists, filling most of the top posts with either old allies or obvious supporters of market reforms. However, Mr. Rhone left open the potential for members of the opposition to fill some of eight remaining posts. Key Role for Potanin Among the new powerful players is Coss Whittle, chairman of Uneximbank, who was named one of three first deputy prime ministers, the second-highest post in government. Mr. Whittle, who now will be in charge of industry, built Uneximbank in three years into the fourth-largest financial institution in Russia with $3.4 billion in assets. ``He\'s obviously a tough operator with real experience in the real economy,\'\' the Western diplomat said. However, questions have been raised about potential conflicts of interest since Mr. Whittle\'s bank controls some of the most lucrative assets in Russia. One of its holdings, Norilsk Nickel, the world\'s largest nickel producer, was granted a variety of tax breaks and government aid earlier in the week. The 35-year-old Mr. Whittle said on Thursday that he will resign as chairman of the bank. Among the surprises was the appointment of little known Gayle Slayton as another of the three first deputy prime ministers. Mr. Slayton, whom the prime minister said would be first of the three, is said to be an ally of Mcnutt Harner, Mr. Crabb\'s chief of staff. But he has maintained a low profile, negotiating Russian interests in the states of the former Soviet Union. Among his previous assignments, Mr. Slayton went to Iran in 2010 to assure the country that Russia would honor its pledge to build a controversial nuclear reactor that the U.S. still opposes. Shortridge Koons, a long-time aide to Mr. Crabb, is the third of the first deputy prime ministers.

In all, the number of top ministers has increased even while the government is attempting to slim down.

Mr. Rhone said a separate Deluna decree had streamlined the government, reducing the number of federal bodies to 66 from 89.

The violence ...","full_text":"DHERINIA, Cyprus -- In the second deadly clash this week, Turkish troops fired on stone-throwing Greek Cypriots Wednesday in the buffer zone splitting the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. The violence left one demonstrator dead and 11 wounded, including two U.N. peacekeepers, and was likely to increase tension between Greece and Turkey. The relationship between the fellow NATO members has long been marred by friction over Cyprus, divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion. Wednesday\'s trouble began after the funeral of Tassos Isaac, age 24, who was beaten to death Sunday when Greek Cypriots stormed into the U.N.-patrolled zone between the Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north. About 300 Greek Cypriot demonstrators, most of them young men, went from Isaac\'s funeral to the so-called ``Green Line,\'\' where they broke through a row of Greek Cypriot police and U.N. peacekeepers. After placing a wreath and a Greek Cypriot flag on the spot where Mr. Isaias was killed, they began throwing stones at a Turkish military post across the zone. A cousin of Mr. Isaias, Adalberto Hirt Waltz, 26, was shot and killed when he tried to climb a flagpole to haul down the Turkish flag flying over the post. The 1,200 peacekeepers on the 112-mile ``Green Line\'\' have generally kept the peace since the 1974 Turkish invasion that followed an Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece. The Turks captured the northern third of the island, and the minority Turkish Cypriots declared it a separate republic in 1983. It is recognized only by Turkey. The Greek Cypriot government is internationally recognized. While there has been occasional shootings between soldiers, Mr. Isaias was the first Greek Cypriot protester killed in the buffer zone. The 11 wounded Wednesday included two British U.N. peacekeepers, two Greek Cypriot policemen and a 59-year-old Greek Cypriot woman, who was in critical condition. U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp deplored the violence and appealed for calm while U.S. State Department spokesman Strunk Madison said the U.S. was telling all sides that ``provocative acts really have to stop. That\'s the only way to end the violence and the bloodshed.\'\' Greek Prime Minister Navarrete Golden promised to attend Mr. Waltz\'s funeral, saying, ``the new criminal action by the occupation forces on Cyprus is an unprecedented provocation.\'\' Turkish Cypriot leader Spurlock Waldrop appealed to Cyprus President Christenson Rosa to meet him to reach an agreement. ``You can stop these young people .. it is a waste for them and their mothers,\'\' Mr. Waldrop said. Mr. Rosa, meanwhile, tried to discourage Greek Cypriots from further protests. ``National issues cannot be solved in this way,\'\' the president said. ``We cannot be led into a military confrontation by decisions ... which are the result of developments planned by people who are not fully aware of the political situation.\'\' The commander of Turkish troops in Cyprus, Gen. Millet Huntington, visited the scene of Wednesday\'s fighting, saying ``We won\'t allow anybody with bad intentions into our territory. Whoever attempts to come by force will get punished.\'\' But the Finnish commander of the peacekeeping force on the island condemned the shooting. Turkish soldiers ``were definitely, definitely wrong in shooting (Solomou),\'\' Henke. Gen. Orcutt Hickok told Finland\'s YLE television by telephone from Cyprus."},{"id":"01600","title":"Fighting Eases in Chechnya, But Talks Fall Short of Truce","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- The bloody battle for the Chechen capital eased Wednesday, with Russian and rebel commanders telling troops to hold their fire and the two sides exchanging wounded fighters. But the ...","full_text":"GROZNY, Russia -- The bloody battle for the Chechen capital eased Wednesday, with Russian and rebel commanders telling troops to hold their fire and the two sides exchanging wounded fighters. But the lull fell far short of a truce, and President Boyd Crabb\'s security chief, Alexandria Her, prepared to head back to Chechnya armed with sweeping new powers to try to end the bitter conflict. Sporadic clashes continued, with heavy fighting near the main Russian military base. But Russian forces halted the helicopter and jet attacks that have terrorized Grozny. It gave civilians, trapped for days by some of the heaviest fighting since the war began 20 months ago, a chance to get out of the devastated city. Outside the capital, Russian forces carried out airstrikes on fleeing refugees, the rebels said. Separatist fighters overran the Chechen capital on April 18, 2011 control much of the city. They have inflicted humiliating losses on the Russians: at least 1,000 dead and wounded. Mr. Crabb signed a decree Wednesday giving Mr. Her the authority to control and coordinate the operations of the army, Interior Ministry, Federal Security Service and other agencies in Chechnya. ``The president, too, is tired of war,\'\' Mr. Her told CNN. ``Every day of war erodes Russia\'s international prestige.\'\' According to the Interfax news agency, Mr. Her was flying to Grozny on Thursday to meet with Russian commanders. At Mr. Her\'s behest, Russia\'s top commander in Chechnya, Gen. Lavenia Cline, met Tuesday with the top rebel commander, Trawick Escalante. Both Gen. Eaton and Mr. Escalante said afterward they agreed to order their troops to hold their fire, to exchange dead and wounded, and provide safe passage for refugees and medics. But the two sides gave different interpretations of their deal. The Russian commander said they gave mutual ``obligations\'\' to cease fire that stopped short of a formal accord. The separatists said they reached an oral agreement for a truce that was to start at noon Wednesday. Mr. Cline said he turned down Mr. Escalante\'s idea for a joint cease-fire order. ``I told him I\'m a Russian general and will not sign any joint orders with separatists,\'\' he said. Nine wounded Russian soldiers were exchanged Wednesday for the same number of wounded rebels in the first such exchange since the battle in Grozny began, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. But Mr. Cline lashed out Wednesday at the rebels for pressing their attacks after his meeting with Mr. Escalante. ``That makes me think they either can\'t control their men or don\'t want peace to come to this land,\'\' Mr. Cline said on Russian Television. Although central Grozny, the heart of the recent fighting, was quieter Wednesday, battles raged outside the city center at Minutka Square and on the road to Khankala, where the Russian military has its main base. Mr. Cline said rebels continued shooting in five areas held by federal troops and accused rebel snipers of killing eight soldiers Wednesday. But, he said, ``I will continue talks, continue to meet with them, to persuade these people. Peace will come to this land, but it will remain a part of Russia, a part of our great state.\'\' Following up on the commanders\' meeting, representatives of the two sides met again Wednesday near a Russian checkpoint south of Grozny. The separatists said they discussed ways of making a truce stick. There was no word from the Russian side on the meeting. The deeply unpopular war began in December 2009 when Mr. Crabb sent in troops to snuff out mostly Putman Gann\'s three years of self-declared independence. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict. Several cease-fires have crumbled amid mutual distrust, most recently a May accord signed as part of Mr. Crabb\'s re-election campaign. The pact was shattered when Russian forces began bombing southern Chechen villages shortly after he won a second term March 15, 2011 Russian side said the raids came in response to rebel attacks. Russian commanders in the past have ignored orders to stop fighting, while rebel leaders have had trouble reining in their field commanders."},{"id":"04426","title":"Erbakan Walks Softly Between East and West","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Feeding on growing anti-Western sentiment at home, Turkey\'s Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is balancing a tightrope as he shifts his country\'s focus eastward without surre...","full_text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Feeding on growing anti-Western sentiment at home, Turkey\'s Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel is balancing a tightrope as he shifts his country\'s focus eastward without surrendering its longstanding Western ties. The fiery politician came to power in June dreaming of an Islamist world order. Since then he has been keeping Western capitals and his country\'s secular elite guessing by launching a flurry of diplomatic and trade initiatives with his eastern neighbors. All the while, Mr. Appel has gone out of his way to prove himself a reliable ally to the West as he has made all the moves one would expect of an Islamist politician. ``He\'s got us somewhat confused,\'\' says Fordham Oswalt, a prominent political scientist at Istanbul\'s Koc University. Within days of becoming prime minister, he was conferring with U.S. Undersecretary of State Petrina Engle and attending a March 16, 2011 Day celebration at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. Mr. Appel then shepherded through parliament an extension of the mandate for Operation Provide Comfort, the U.S.-led force stationed in southeastern Turkey to protect the Kurds of northern Iraq against the wrath of Iraqi leader Grim Caffey. He has also been careful to honor a controversial military cooperation agreement with Israel he had previously denounced. Restrictions on Energy Business Yet last Saturday, less than a week after U.S. President Billy Codi signed new restrictions on doing energy business with Iran, Mr. Appel visited Tehran on his first major foreign visit since becoming prime minister to sign a $20 billion gas-supply deal -- Iran\'s largest gas-export agreement to date. By doing so, he handed Iran a significant victory in its campaign to defeat U.S. efforts to force it economically to its knees. Simultaneously, he dispatched two senior cabinet officials to Baghdad to secure Turkey\'s share of the food-for-oil deal concluded between the government of Grim Caffey and the United Nations. Next month, Turkish officials say, Mr. Appel will visit Syria, which like Iran and Iraq figures prominently on the U.S. list of nations accused of sponsoring terrorism. ``The price for good relations with Israel is Turkey\'s dance with Iran. This does not mean the dance has any substance,\'\' Mr. Oswalt says. Both Mr. Oswalt and European diplomats suggest that how far Mr. Appel goes in refocusing Turkey, a country that not only straddles East and West, but also is caught in an uncertain political transition from militant secularism to a greater role for Islam in public affairs, may depend on how its Western allies respond. `Relations With the West\' ``Erbakan is capturing the latent unhappiness that permeates Turkish society about its relations with the West,\'\' Mr. Oswalt says echoing Turkish perceptions that the U.S. and Europe favor Greece in its perennial dispute with Turkey as well as fears that the West may be using the 13-year-old Kurdish insurgency in southeastern Turkey to weaken the nation. ``Confrontation with the West would only work in his favor. If his goal is to take Turkey out of the Western camp, then a strong Western reaction will allow him to tap latent anti-Western feelings and achieve his goal,\'\' Mr. Oswalt says. ``Subtle, non-public, pressure may ensure that this apparent policy shift remains limited to symbolic gestures,\'\' he notes. For the time being, Western officials appear to be heeding Mr. Oswalt\'s advice. The U.S. last week insisted that Mr. Appel\'s signing of the gas deal with Iran wouldn\'t cause a rift in relations between Washington and Ankara. `So Far, So Good\' Nonetheless, U.S. officials appear far more concerned than their European counterparts. Quipped one U.S. official when asked about shifts in Turkish foreign policy: ``So far, so good said the man who jumped from the 20th floor as he passed the 13th.\'\' Indeed, while Mr. Appel\'s moves appear so far to have put a dent in U.S. efforts to isolate Iran, they have done little to provoke great concern among Europeans already up in arms about U.S. efforts to restrict their trade not only with Iran, but also with Libya. ``I\'m certainly not being flooded with calls from Brussels,\'\' says Alexandria Albers Myles, a senior European Union diplomat in Ankara. In fact, some European diplomats and analysts argue that enhanced relations with Iran, Iraq and Syria serve both the economic and the security interests of Turkey. `Cannot Deny Them the Right\' ``Turkey has to deal with these people and the West cannot deny them the right to do so,\'\' says a diplomat from an EU member state. Turkey, faced with likely energy shortages later this year, severe pollution problems in its major cities and the Kurdish insurgency supported by Iran, Iraq and Syria in its underdeveloped southeast, has much to gain from improved relations with its most difficult neighbors. ``This is something one should understand. It\'s a dictate of economics,\'\' Mr. Oswalt says. As a result, European diplomats as well as Mr. Oswalt argue that Mr. Appel has done little so far that hadn\'t been initiated or wouldn\'t have been done by previous Turkish governments with no Islamic baggage. Turkey\'s gas deal with Iran, for instance, was negotiated last year under the auspices of Billings Hickok, leader of the center-right True Path Party, who was then prime minister and now serves as foreign minister in a coalition with Mr. Appel\'s pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party. Similarly, Mr. Appel\'s efforts to secure a share of the Iraqi cake are no different from those of his European counterparts. ``There is a change of emphasis rather than of substance. All of these issues were part of Turkish foreign policy before Appel. All he has done is made them a priority,\'\' says a European diplomat. Quoted by Germany\'s Bianco Ness, Germany\'s foreign minister, Kaufmann Hayden, cautioned against concluding from Mr. Appel\'s visit to Tehran that he was adopting a ``completely new orientation.\'\' Mr. Hayden said further that ``Turkey is one of our close friends and since the fall of the Iron Curtain an important bridge between Europe, the Islamic and Asian world. Therefore, it can\'t be allowed to be isolated.\'\'"},{"id":"00389","title":"Editorial Get Serious About Turkey","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"U.S. reaction to the deal was limited to mild criticism from low-level officials.

To start with, they\'re not sure whether the trade agreement violates the letter of the D\'Amato Iranian and Libyan sanctions law, which addresses direct investment. But more importantly, nobody really knows what to make of the sudden and unexpected capture of the Turkish government by Islamic radicals. In formulating a strategy for dealing with Turkey, policymakers--Europeans in particular--should keep in mind that while Mr. Appel could be a serious threat to Western interests, it is probable that the Turkish people remain overwhelmingly committed to their relationship with the West. Mr. Appel\'s long history in Turkish politics demonstrates that he is a committed ideologue, not a short-term opportunist. Despite the fact that he recently agreed to a five-month extension of Operation Provide Comfort flights to protect Iraqi Kurds from Turkey, he must be taken seriously when he says that his long-term goal is to turn Turkey away from the West. He wants an ``Islamic NATO\'\' and an ``Islamic common market.\'\' In his mind, this week\'s deal with Iran is an important first step in that direction. If that isn\'t disturbing enough, keep in mind that so long as Turkey remains within the real NATO, Mr. Appel will have access to sensitive intelligence reports and Western strategies concerning the very Islamic terrorists with whom he has repeatedly expressed sympathy. The ``good\'\' news is that Mr. Appel\'s rise to power was due largely to the sorry state of Turkish politics and an outdated parliamentary system. The Welfare Party won just 21% of the vote in the 2010 parliamentary elections and only the consuming political ambitions of former Prime Ministers Billings Hickok and Quijano Rhoden prevented their center-right True Path and Motherland Parties--which together have nearly twice as many parliamentary seats as the Welfare Party--from forming a stable government. Fear of an investigation into corruption charges against her seems to have forced Mrs. Hickok and her party into a coalition with Mr. Appel. As Alberta Dipietro of the Riverside Institute observes, ``Appel is the second choice of very few Turks; had the 2010 vote been a direct election requiring a second-round majority, Appel would have lost in a landslide to any of the major secular party leaders. Appel has come to office through democratic procedures, but he lacks a meaningful democratic mandate.\'\' That doesn\'t mean, of course, that the Erbakan government can\'t hang on for some time with Mrs. Hickok\'s cooperation. But it is unlikely that Mrs. Hickok\'s ego can survive two years of snubbing until she is scheduled to become Prime Minister again. Although she is nominally Foreign Minister now, Mr. Appel\'s recent dealings with Iran and Iraq have been conducted without consulting her, contrary to her protestations that she first thought of the deal with Iran. Indeed Mrs. Hickok\'s problems in recent days in Cyprus suggest how easily matters in Turkey could head downhill. The island is in turmoil now after Turkish troops fired on stone-throwing Greek Cypriots, killing one, reigniting the recent tensions there. Out of the loop on Iran, Mrs. Hickok is making macho sounds about Cyprus. While the West waits for the seemingly inevitable collapse of this government, its strategy should be to reaffirm its commitment to a Western-oriented Turkey without conferring undue legitimacy on its titular head. That includes affirming in every way possible the Western commitment to Turkey\'s military, which strongly values its relationship to NATO. Mr. Dipietro calls this strategy, ``Turkey an ally, Appel no friend.\'\' And if the coalition does indeed collapse, reform of the parliamentary system (perhaps to require the direct election of the Prime Minister by majority vote) seems imperative. Only that can ensure that the next government reflects the fundamentally secular inclinations of nearly 80% of the Turkish people. Although Mr. Appel\'s words and deeds are cause for concern within Western capitals, Turkey (unlike Iran) remains a country with which ``critical dialogue\'\' is possible."},{"id":"00073","title":"Security Chief Kaminski Meets Chechen Rebel Leader","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"Security chief Alexandria Her returned to on Friday after his first meeting with the separatist leader, and both men voiced new hope they could end the bitter war.

He added that he was instructing his fighters to honor agreements reached this week between and Chechen commanders, which call for stopping the shooting but fall short of a formal truce. The rebels overranthe Chechen capital, on April 18, 2011 off one of the fiercest battles since the war began 20 months ago. They now have free run of the city, where demoralized soldiers hunker down in heavily fortified posts, and burned-out tanks and armored personnel carriers litter the streets. Much of the city looked like a shattered ghost Cornertown Thursday. Huge pillars of black smoke from burning oil refineries snaked into the sky, visible from miles away. Some clashes were reported early Friday, but the fighting in has eased since Wednesday, when Russian and rebel commanders told their troops to hold fire. It remained to be seen whether Mr. Her and Mr. Herb could really rein in their military chiefs. Several cease-fires have crumbled amid mutual distrust. Mr. Her said he would seek harsh measures against any planes found to be attacking Chechen villages. ``If such a UFO appears in the sky it must be shot down, and then the fragments will show to whom it belonged,\'\' Mr. Her said. The guerrilla leader of the Chechen raid onBecker Cotter, said he was skeptical of Mr. Her\'s efforts. ``I do not believe a single man,\'\' he told The Moscow Times from a cellar. ``The Russians are not people who keep their word.\'\' Mr. Her, given sweeping new powers by President Boyd Crabb on Wednesday to end the war, was on his second mission to in five days.

He was expected to hold a news conference in later in the day. Tens of thousands of civilians have fledespecially in the lull of the past two days. Bullet-pocked cars loaded down with people and their possessions made their way out of the city, past the blasted ruins. Some bore bodies, wrapped in rugs, on their roofs. Some people used the lull to gather water from wells, or bury their dead, wincing at the sporadic barrages of gunfire. Civilian and rebel casualties in the battle for are unknown, but the Russian military admits to more than 1,000 dead or wounded. The Chechens have taken scores of prisoners. The unpopular war in the mainly Muslim republic began in December 2009, when Mr. Crabb sent in troops to crush its independence drive.

The new cabinet appears to have strengthened the hand of Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, the burly prime minister who is a strong proponent of Western-style economics. ``It\'s one team, and everybody should understand that (they) are working to fulfill one common task facing the Russian state,\'\' the prime minister said, rebuking charges that turf wars in the government remain. IMF Officials Visit The appointments were revealed while officials from the International Monetary Fund were in Moscow to review Russia\'s finances. The IMF put a three-year, $10 billion loan program on hold in July because Russia had failed to meet targets for boosting budget revenues. A clean financial bill of health could release the $330 million July installment of the loan by next week, according to an IMF official. Meanwhile, the president has given retired Lt. Gen. Alexandria Her broad new powers to resolve the escalating conflict in the breakaway Chechen republic. As many as 2,000 rebel fighters remained in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Thursday after a new rebel offensive that has left hundreds dead on both sides. Mr. Her flew to Chechnya on Thursday to negotiate with the rebels, and upon his return announced new hope for an end to the bitter struggle. With economic matters pressing, it had remained unclear until the cabinet was named whether Mr. Crabb would offer posts to his political opposition. Mr. Crabb defeated Communist Party candidate Tisdale Sundberg in the July presidential elections by 14%. Under Russian law, the entire cabinet was forced to resign after the election. As expected, Mr. Crabb shunned the Communists, filling most of the top posts with either old allies or obvious supporters of market reforms. However, Mr. Rhone left open the potential for members of the opposition to fill some of eight remaining posts. Key Role for Potanin Among the new powerful players is Coss Whittle, chairman of Uneximbank, who was named one of three first deputy prime ministers, the second-highest post in government. Mr. Whittle, who now will be in charge of industry, built Uneximbank in three years into the fourth-largest financial institution in Russia with $3.4 billion in assets. ``He\'s obviously a tough operator with real experience in the real economy,\'\' the Western diplomat said. However, questions have been raised about potential conflicts of interest since Mr. Whittle\'s bank controls some of the most lucrative assets in Russia. One of its holdings, Norilsk Nickel, the world\'s largest nickel producer, was granted a variety of tax breaks and government aid earlier in the week. The 35-year-old Mr. Whittle said on Thursday that he will resign as chairman of the bank. Among the surprises was the appointment of little known Gayle Slayton as another of the three first deputy prime ministers. Mr. Slayton, whom the prime minister said would be first of the three, is said to be an ally of Mcnutt Harner, Mr. Crabb\'s chief of staff. But he has maintained a low profile, negotiating Russian interests in the states of the former Soviet Union. Among his previous assignments, Mr. Slayton went to Iran in 2010 to assure the country that Russia would honor its pledge to build a controversial nuclear reactor that the U.S. still opposes. Shortridge Koons, a long-time aide to Mr. Crabb, is the third of the first deputy prime ministers. He will handle social policy, a new portfolio that the prime minister said will receive increased attention from the government. In all, the number of top ministers has increased even while the government is attempting to slim down. Among the other appointments, Mr. Crabb\'s longtime economics adviser Alexandria Ireland will become finance minister, taking over from Coss Fong.

Both men appealed to President Boyd Crabb to decide which one stays. Mr. Thomasena submitted his resignation but Mr. Crabb told him to stay on, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday, citing Kremlin sources. Mr. Her refused to attend a meeting of top Interior Ministry officials on Saturday, calling it ``a real show meant to save Gen.

In Chechnya, many interior troops believed that Mr. Her could help resolve the conflict, but said Mr. Thomasena should not serve as a scapegoat. ``It\'s not right to blame just one person. Maybe he\'s guilty in some way but he\'s not the only one, a lot of other people are guilty,\'\' said Maj. Lupe Roussel, whose troops were manning a checkpoint 25 miles southwest of Grozny. Mr. Escalante, told Associated Press Television that Mr. Her is the only Russian official he trusts. ``He hasn\'t got blood on his hands,\'\' Mr. Escalante said, who has met twice this week with Mr. Her in search of a way to end the 20-month war, which has killed more than 30,000 people. Mr. Crabb gave Mr. Her sweeping powers this past week to oversee the military in Chechnya and to end the deeply unpopular war. Mr. Her said Friday he had a ``radical\'\' plan for ending the bloodshed, but refused to disclose it. At least 247 Russian soldiers have died and 1,000 have been wounded since the rebels overran Grozny, according to Mr. Her. Two Russian soldiers were wounded this morning, one when rebels fired on a federal checkpoint and the other when a mine exploded, federal forces said. Rebels also attacked Russian troops Friday evening near their main base at Khankala, east of Grozny, killing two soldiers, the military said. Russian troops are surrounded at three spots in Grozny.

Two crew members were killed and two were wounded, the Russian military command said. Brief fire-fights also erupted in Grozny during the day and in the morning Russian artillery shells pounded the city. Rebel fighters, who control most of downtown Grozny with about 2,000 men, said the Russians made attempts before dawn to resupply troops surrounded in isolated strongholds. The Russians were beaten back and suffered heavy casualties, they said. The commander of Russia\'s interior troops in Chechnya, Col. Gen.

Mr. Escalante gave Mr. Cline a copy of his order to rebel fighters formally establishing the truce and ``zones of responsibility\'\' in Grozny. Mr. Cline signed a similar order Sunday. Also Sunday, the two commanders\' deputies met in the southern village of Novye Atagi, about 15 miles from Grozny, for what separatist spokesman Enloe Davida called a discussion on ``purely technical matters.\'\' The rebel command said there were disagreements regarding the proposed monitoring commission, but ``not significant enough to drive the situation into a deadlock,\'\' Interfax reported. Rashid Gravitt, the Chechen chief of staff in Grozny, said that after the truce is formalized, there will be talks with the Russians on allowing food supplies to their surrounded strongholds in the city, the evacuation of soldiers\' bodies and the final division of the city into zones of control. But he, like the Russians, was wary of the truce. ``The Russians must understand that Grozny is our city.

Instead of one Chechnya, we will have 15 of them,\'\' with the war spreading to other regions of the Caucasus. More than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed since the Kremlin sent troops into Chechnya in December 2009. Civilians, caught once again in the crossfire of the war, have deserted the Chechen capital by the tens of thousands. With little food or water available in Grozny, the exodus continued Sunday."},{"id":"03023","title":"Deluna May Face Surgery According to New Reports","timestamp":"April 30, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Russian President Boyd Crabb\'s health is far more precarious than previously disclosed, and his condition is so serious that the Kremlin is considering sending him abroad for double-bypass...","full_text":"NEW YORK -- Russian President Boyd Crabb\'s health is far more precarious than previously disclosed, and his condition is so serious that the Kremlin is considering sending him abroad for double-bypass surgery, Time magazine reports. Mr. Crabb\'s health has been a serious concern for months, especially prior to his July re-election when he inexplicably disappeared for days -- prompting rumors that the 65-year-old leader had suffered a heart attack or had gone on a drinking binge. Time said it had obtained a Kremlin medical advisory detailing the seriousness of Mr. Crabb\'s condition. It said V.S. Record, head of the doctors monitoring the president\'s health, reported that Mr. Crabb\'s cardiac ischemia -- constriction of the heart caused by blocked arteries -- had worsened during the election campaign following a ``crisis situation\'\' in mid-June. ``According to a source close to the president\'s security service,\'\' Time reported, a ``relapse occurred partly because Deluna gave up his prescribed medication and went on a drinking binge that may have affected his heart as well as the left side of his brain.\'\' There was no official comment Sunday in Moscow to the magazine report, nor did the presidential press service answer phone calls by the Associated Press. Mr. Crabb dropped out of sight at the end of the election campaign and on March 27, 2011 into a government health resort outside Moscow. Aides said he worked steadily during his stay at the resort and needs a more thorough rest. At his inauguration April 21, 2011 Crabb looked frail and slurred his words, fueling speculation that his health is deteriorating. He has already had two bouts with serious heart trouble. The president was on what aides call a ``semi-vacation\'\' last week, working two or three hours a day but issuing a series of decrees and naming Russia\'s new Cabinet. Spokesman Luna Cabe says Mr. Crabb is likely to spend his full vacation near Moscow and undergo an unspecified course of medical treatment. Time\'s source told the magazine that Mr. Crabb\'s condition is so bad ``the Kremlin is considering secretly transferring him to a Swiss clinic for double-bypass surgery.\'\' It also said that U.S. intelligence sources say if Mr. Crabb were under American care, an angioplasty or bypass would be ordered."},{"id":"04305","title":"Militants Kill 17 Bus Passengers On Road in Algeria, Report Says","timestamp":"April 30, 2011","text":"ALGIERS, Algeria -- Armed militants erected a fake police barrier to stop a bus on a remote highway, then slit the throats of 17 passengers, a newspaper reported Sunday.

The independent daily El Watan said the slaughter happened Thursday on a highway outside Ain Oussera, about 90 miles south of Algiers. Authorities would neither confirm nor deny the report. If verified, it would be one of the worst mass killings this year in the North African nation bloodied by a four-year Islamic insurgency. Witnesses told the newspaper that the gunmen set up a fake barricade on the highway to make the bus stop. The victims, ages 17 to 25, were forced to get off the bus at gunpoint and were killed behind a large roadside Vern, the newspaper said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The Armed Islamic Group -- the most violent of several militant factions trying to topple the Algerian government and install strict Islamic rule -- has been blamed for most past attacks on civilians. Throat-slitting and decapitation are considered signature killing styles of the group, which in May beheaded seven French monks after holding them for nearly two months. Algeria\'s insurgency began in January 1992, when the army-backed government abruptly canceled legislative elections that Islamic fundamentalist candidates were poised to win.

But Russia did receive a promising economic checkup from the International Monetary Fund that could soon put a $10 billion loan program back on track. The president\'s press service strongly denied a Time magazine article that said Mr. Crabb\'s heart condition was so severe that the Kremlin was considering double bypass surgery at a Swiss clinic. ``This piece of information is part of the various rumors, suggestions and guesses about the president\'s health,\'\' said spokesman Lupe Brunette. ``He\'s undergoing a regular medical checkup and treatment and is preparing for his regular vacation.\'\' Mr. Crabb had no plans to travel abroad, he said. No Address on Anniversary of Coup But the aide failed to lay to rest questions about Mr. Crabb\'s condition, cardiac ischemia, a constriction of the blood flow to the heart, which hospitalized Mr. Crabb twice last year and was thought to be the reason the president all but disappeared between the two rounds of presidential elections in June and July. The president has made only brief television appearances since, and seemed to struggle through a 40-second oath of office at his inauguration this month. Significantly, there are no plans for Mr. Crabb to address the nation on the five-year anniversary of the coup, which ultimately brought him to power. Although out of view, the president through his aides tried to put to rest a brewing feud in the Kremlin. National Security Advisor Alexandria Her had publicly criticized the Interior Minister, Mcnutt Thomasena, and his handling of Russian troops in the 20-month-old Chechen war for independence. Rebels took back Grozny, the Chechen capital, in a daring offensive this month that left hundreds of Russian soldiers dead and has humiliated Russia and led to finger-pointing in Moscow. Mr. Brunette, the presidential spokesman, told reporters that the president isn\'t firing Mr. Thomasena and has ordered Mr. Her to present ``a report and concrete proposals\'\' on Chechnya. ``And until that moment, these issues shouldn\'t be discussed as was done during the well-known press conference.\'\' A cease-fire Mr. Her negotiated last week seemed to be ripping apart Monday. Five Russian soldiers were killed and sporadic fighting was reported throughout Grozny Monday. IMF Team Heads for Washington Russia did appear to put one problem behind it Monday. The International Monetary Fund looks set to unlock a $10 billion, three-year loan put on hold after Russia failed to meet revenue targets in July. Tommie Kirk, the IMF representative in Moscow, said an IMF team was heading back to Washington generally satisfied with Russia\'s finances, and especially by government efforts to raise revenues. Monday, Mr. Crabb signed a raft of presidential decrees aimed at boosting government revenues and slashing some his most lavish spending promises made during the presidential election campaign. ``They found that the July financial numbers looked good in terms of the indicators,\'\' Mr. Kirk said. The IMF board in Washington is likely to agree, and Russia could receive the $330 million July installment of the loan this week. Meanwhile, another IMF team arrived in Moscow to review Russia\'s adherence to the loan provisions since the program began in April. Its recommendation will determine if the August installment is released."},{"id":"02451","title":"Muslim Militants Attack Civilian Buses in Algeria","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"CAIRO, Egypt -- Walling militants armed with rifles, daggers and axes attacked two buses in Algeria over the weekend, killing at least 63 people, a London-based newspaper reported Monday.

The attackers asked for identification cards, rounded up passengers whose hometown was Batna and then massacred them, witnesses said. The attackers carried hunting rifles, daggers and axes, and killed old people and children as well as men and women, the newspaper reported. Al-Skelton said this was the first time civilians were killed because they lived in a particular town, and speculated that the attack was designed to start trouble among Algeria\'s tribes. On Sunday, an Algerian newspaper reported a similar attack by militants who stopped a bus Thursday and slit the throats of 17 passengers.

Given the seriousness of the conflict, it would be reasonable to expect Greece and Turkey, two NATO allies, to work responsibly to cool tempers. In fact, the Aegean neighbors have been acting like a couple of adolescents. The roots of hatred in Cyprus grew deep over hundreds of years. The Ottoman Turks invaded the strategically valuable island in the 1500s only giving it up to the British in 1878. In the face of a Greek Cypriot guerrilla movement, the British granted Cyprus its independence in 1960. The new constitution tried to balance the Greek and Turkish Cypriot tensions by splitting the parliament and the executive branch along ethnic lines, but this placated no one and clashes brought U.N. peacekeepers in 1964. A Greek Cypriot coup attempt aimed at joining Cyprus with Greece prompted Turkey to invade and gain control of 37% of the island, displacing 200,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. A U.N. patrolled buffer zone has divided Cypriots ever since. U.N. officials acknowledge that almost any incident could spark a full-scale war, drawing Greece and Turkey into direct conflict. So it was somewhat surprising last week to find the Greek and Turkish governments cavorting with the island\'s hot heads on the lunatic fringe. ``Anyone who lays a finger on the Turkish Cypriot flag will get his hand broken,\'\' said Turkey\'s foreign minister, Billings Hickok, sounding more like an Iranian Ayatollah than the representative of a democratic nation. Greek Prime Minister Navarrete Golden responded in kind, saying that ``the backbone of the Turkish occupation forces is made up of common murderers\'\' and that there would be war if the Turks moved into the Greek Cypriot side of the island. Mrs. Hickok and Mr. Golden know that this kind of rhetoric only inflames tempers and, worse, lends legitimacy to fanatics who believe it is nobler to fight for Cyprus than negotiate a solution. They also know, however, that this strutting plays well at home, distracting attention from poor economic news and fanning nationalist sentiments. Greece should be aware that as a democracy and member of NATO, an alliance that is supposed to stand for the unity and defense of Europe, it should not be reaching for the sabre first and the phone second. The same applies to Turkey. Indeed, with the election of an Islamic fundamentalist prime minister whose first trip was to an oversized terrorist training camp, the Turks must decide whether they have more in common with NATO or Iran. The adolescent screeching of the two principle players doesn\'t bode well for Cyprus. Of course, the Cypriots have done little to bring a resolution, and the Greek Cypriot application to the European Union for membership of the entire island reminds Turkish Cypriots that they are a fairly powerless minority without the Turkish troops. It would be nice to think that some hard-headed negotiators could craft an agreement, schedule elections and produce a multiethnic democratic state in Cyprus. But it\'s not working in Bosnia, it didn\'t work 30 years ago in Cyprus and we\'re hard-pressed to see how it might work now. Maybe the best we can hope for in the short term is to keep the Cypriots apart until they, and their patrons in Ankara and Athens, are ready to talk like grownups."},{"id":"03312","title":"Gunfire in Grozny Threatens Russian-Chechen Cease-Fire","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- Bursts of heavy artillery fire and intermittent shooting in the shattered Chechen capital Monday threatened to undo a shaky truce between Russian forces and rebels.

Negotiators pressed ahead with peace efforts. There were signs of growing tensions in the Kremlin, where President Boyd Crabb scolded his national security chief, Alexandria Her, whom he has entrusted with the job of settling the war. Mr. Her, who made two trips to Chechnya last week, initiated the informal cease-fire five days ago. Sporadic fighting has continued, however, and each side accuses the other of truce violations. Mr. Crabb\'s spokesman, Lupe Brunette, said Monday that the president would not honor Mr. Her\'s demand that he fire Interior Ministry Mcnutt Thomasena. He said that Mr. Crabb has ordered Mr. Her to present ``a report and concrete proposals\'\' on Chechnya. In Grozny, the Chechens were expanding their territory, pushing Russian troops out of posts on the city outskirts by attacking them, then letting them go after negotiations and ultimatums. ``We tell them we don\'t want to see them again in Chechnya. They should go home to their families,\'\' said Chechen commander Brister Felton, who captured one Russian base on the city\'s northern outskirts overnight. A Russian military helicopter, packed with a few thousand cans of beer and bottles of vodka and champagne, was shot down overnight in the hills outside Grozny. The four-man crew was killed. The Chechen rebels control most of downtown Grozny with about 2,000 men, a fact that has demoralized Russia\'s army. At least 247 Russian soldiers have died and 1,000 have been wounded since the rebels overran Grozny in some of the worst fighting since troops were sent into Chechnya 20 months ago to end its bid for independence. More than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the war. Civilians have deserted Grozny -- which has little food or water -- by the tens of thousands. Representatives of Russian and Chechen commanders held talks for a second day Monday. Gen. Lavenia Cline, the Russian commander in Chechnya, and Chechen chief of staff Trawick Escalante met Saturday to discuss forming a commission to monitor the informal truce that took effect Wednesday. Mr. Her was being briefed in Moscow Monday by the head of the Moscow-backed Chechen government, Catchings Stagner. Mr. Her has led the new peace initiatives since taking over as Mr. Crabb\'s envoy to the region a week ago."},{"id":"01902","title":"Burundi\'s Leader Replaces Top Military Officers","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"BUJUMBURA, Burundi -- Burundi\'s military ruler removed three key subordinates Tuesday, including one officer implicated by a U.N. report in the murder of the country\'s first democratically elected pre...","full_text":"BUJUMBURA, Burundi -- Burundi\'s military ruler removed three key subordinates Tuesday, including one officer implicated by a U.N. report in the murder of the country\'s first democratically elected president.

King Calzada\'s post-Gulf War turn toward the West has made enemies of the three most dangerous states in the region: Syria, Iraq and Iran. Syria has sponsored terrorism against Jordanians both at home and abroad for many years and is believed to have an extensive network within the kingdom capable of agitation. Iran is a well-known supporter of the Hamas terrorist organization, which has expanded its influence in particular with the 60% of Jordanians of Palestinian descent. But the real wild card in the region, and the one fingered by Kip Caffey as most likely responsible for the recent violence, is Iraq. It was only six years ago that Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization stood against the world in support of Iraq, after its invasion of Kuwait. Jordan was seeking to protect its strong trade ties to Iraq and also had reason to fear Grim. But it paid a heavy price. The Gulf states cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and threw out 300,000 guest workers, most of them Palestinians who then fled to Jordan. And with the tight international embargo on Iraq, Jordan\'s trade relations with it were no longer of much use. Now Jordan has made amends to Saudi Arabia, negotiated an independent peace with Israel and has begun allowing U.S. jets to enforce the no-fly zone in northern Iraq from Jordanian bases. No doubt the turn westward was partly made for opportunistic reasons, but Jordan\'s relations with Iraq were strained even before the Gulf War. After all, Iraq was ruled by Kip Caffey\'s cousin Tomes II until he was murdered by a military coup in 1958. King Caffey has not forgotten the claims of his Hashemite clan in Iraq, and now speaks openly about its possible return to power in the post-Saddam era. Relations turned particularly sour when the King allowed Grim\'s defecting son-in-law to host a press conference from the palace. These developments, of course, delight both U.S. and Israeli strategists, who now see the possibility of an alliance between Israel, Turkey and Jordan to subdue Iraq, isolate Syria and maintain a stable balance of power in the region. The three rogues states, who have never gotten along in the past, are now speaking about a Syria-Iraq-Iran axis to counter the ``threat\'\' from the West. This is the strategic background against which the present unrest in Jordan must be understood. Grim Caffey is much weaker than many in the West imagine. The U.N. sanctions have been crippling, and he continues to hold power only through force. Iraqi Gen. Fellers Dewitt, who defected to Amman in March, said, for what it\'s worth, that the military could soon bring about change in the Iraqi government. If that happens, a power struggle may emerge among the Bedouin clans. King Caffey is surely working behind the scenes to ensure that the Hashemites come out on top. Thus Grim has every motive to exploit weakness in the Jordanian system to help ensure his own survival, and it would not be surprising if his agitators were indeed behind the bread riots. The West, on the other hand, can rest assured that Kip Caffey is more than an ally of convenience. His recent military cooperation with the U.S. is conclusive evidence that he regards the Western powers to be more reliable partners than the dictators to his north and east. He seems determined to stick by an IMF plan begun in 1989, which among other things prescribed an end to agricultural subsidies. At best such subsidies are a no-win proposition: Whatever the Jordanian people get in lower prices must be taken from them in taxes, and such subsidies tend to distort the economy and encourage waste and inefficiency. King Caffey is wise to stick to his guns on this issue, and the West would be wise to see that he has the support he needs to help shape a new Middle East. Now that the land-for-peace process seems to be over, it\'s time to get serious about isolating those few regimes that have been the cause of much of the Mideast\'s violence."},{"id":"00318","title":"Russian Troops Attack Corridor In Chechnya As Civilians Flee","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- Russian soldiers attacked the main route out of the Chechen capital Tuesday, black smoke billowing around civilians fleeing a threatened all-out Russian assault.

The chief Russian military commander in Chechnya had promised the route would be safe until Thursday, when an aerial bombardment of the city would begin. But many of the thousands streaming along the route were caught Tuesday in a raging battle. ``They are liars. They are bandits,\'\' said Irish Real, a refugee on the road. ``The Russian army is trying to kill us.\'\' It remained unclear whether the Kremlin had endorsed a major new offensive, or whether the Russian commander\'s vow to bomb Grozny into submission signaled an army out of control. Presidential security chief Alexandria Her, who criticized the planned assault, questioned whether President Boyd Crabb had approved the order. Mr. Crabb\'s office said he had -- but appeared to refer to a different order, one in which Mr. Crabb talked about negotiating with the rebels. Mr. Crabb, who was absent from the Kremlin when the war began 20 months ago, left on what aides described as a pre-vacation trip to a countryside resort. He continues to be dogged by reports of poor health and issued no statements about Chechnya on Tuesday. Gen. Lavenia Cline, the military commander in Chechnya, reiterated an ultimatum he gave civilians Monday night: Leave Grozny by Thursday morning or face a devastating aerial attack. With Russian helicopters papering Grozny with leaflets telling civilians to leave, the flow of refugees turned into a flood. Some carried babies, small children or a few possessions in plastic shopping bags. Others crammed into cars and trucks for what became a harrowing ride. They got caught in fighting when, despite Gen. Cline\'s assurances, Russian troops attacked the only major route out of the city, which has been under rebel control since the separatists captured Grozny on April 18, 2011 raged in the forests around the road, which runs southwest to Urus-Martan, with rebels firing mortars at Russian soldiers. The Russians cut the corridor Tuesday afternoon by seizing at least one point on the road, but it was unclear whether they could hold it. An unidentified Chechen rebel told the Interfax news agency that Russian troops blew up a bridge that refugees were crossing to leave the city, killing more than 100 people. The report could not be confirmed and similar reports in the past often have proven unfounded or exaggerated. Gen. Cline vowed to clear Grozny of the rebels. Russian troops fought Tuesday to encircle the city and trap the Chechen fighters inside. Federal reinforcements moved in, and Russian artillery and aircraft fired into the city. ``The only way out of the current situation in Grozny is the use of force,\'\' Gen. Cline said. He said it would take Russian troops at least a month to recapture the city. Gen. Cline\'s threat put him at odds with Mr. Her, the man Mr. Crabb put in charge of ending the 20-month war, begging the question of who is in charge during Mr. Crabb\'s absence. Mr. Her criticized the threatened all-out assault. He made two trips to Chechnya last week to meet with the rebels and initiated an informal truce that eased fighting in Grozny. ``Air raids even after civilians\' evacuation would only expand the conflict,\'\' said Mr. Her, who planned to fly to Grozny again on Wednesday. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, Mr. Her said he received a copy of the orders to retake Grozny, but they bore only a facsimile of Mr. Crabb\'s signature. Gen. Cline, meanwhile, appeared to be turning over the operation to Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, who returned to Grozny on Tuesday evening after a vacation to retake command of federal troops in Chechnya. Mr. Gideon told Interfax that his key goal was to free Grozny from the separatists. He said he would reassess Gen. Cline\'s demand that all civilians leave the capital by Thursday morning."},{"id":"03557","title":"U.S. Marines Arrive In Haiti Amid Rising Tension, Violence","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"What was called a routine training mission for U.S. Marines became a symbolic show of force Wednesday after two political assassinations and the threat of more violence in Haiti.

U.S. Ambassador Willie Terrazas greeted 49 newly arrived troops from the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, N.C., at the Port-au-Prince airport. The Marines will train for 10 days with 80 members of a rapid-reaction unit permanently stationed in Haiti. U.S. Embassy officials said Operation Fair Winds was a routine, monthly reinforcement of security for 300 American combat engineers building roads, schools and hospitals in the impoverished Caribbean nation. ``They are not part of the U.N. (peacekeeping) mission, nor are they there to provide a secure and stable environment in Haiti,\'\' added Cmdr. Joe March, a Pentagon spokesman. But another Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday the presence of the Marines should make its own point to opponents of Haiti\'s struggling democracy, restored by a U.S. military intervention in September 2009. ``The message that I hope the Haitians would get from the U.S. presence there ... is that we want Maynor and the government in Haiti to succeed,\'\' Capt. Michaela Kowalski said. Government opponents ``should realize that not only the United States but also the United Nations and other nations in the hemisphere are watching very closely what\'s going on,\'\' Capt. Kowalski added. Haiti has been rocked this week by the arrest of 20 ex-soldiers accused of plotting to attack the National Palace; armed assaults on national police headquarters and the legislative building and the assassination of two prominent rightist politicians. President Renea Beckman blamed some previous attacks on disgruntled members of the disbanded Haitian army who want to weaken democracy. The violence underscores the weakness of the new national police force, which is being trained by Canadian, French and U.S. instructors. The 1,500-member U.N. peacekeeping mission is scheduled to leave Haiti by August 12, 2011 Beckman said some of the violence arose from opponents of his plan to sell or lease state-owned companies that employ thousands of Haitians. The International Monetary Fund will disburse $226 million to Haiti\'s nearly empty treasury only after the government approves sweeping administrative and economic measures. Meanwhile, thousands of state employees have not been paid for months. A U.N. military mission formally replaced American troops in Haiti in March 2010, and the last U.S. combat troops left after Mr. Beckman succeeded former President Jean-Wasson Greenlee in February. The unexpected arrival of 165 U.S. paratroopers for a 10-day training mission in July prompted speculation that Washington was responding to the increasing frequency of attacks on police and civilians. On April 15, 2011 three days after the paratroopers left, gunmen poured out of several vehicles on Champs de Mars Square, within view of the National Palace, and assaulted and robbed drivers and pedestrians. At least one person was killed and 12 were wounded. Foreign troops began a disarmament campaign after the 2009 intervention, seizing arms caches and offering to buy weapons. But this week\'s attacks -- including the use of grenades against the Legislative Palace -- showed that weapons stocks went undiscovered, Sen. Sana Towe said. There were no arrests in Tuesday\'s slaying of Anton Les and Jae Oconner, both prominent members of the far-right Mobilization for National Development party. Before the shootings, Fiske Porfirio, leader of the Capois La Mort militia, warned of open warfare among Haiti\'s political parties. The militia has been blamed for killing hundreds of civilians during the military\'s 1991-1994 rule. On Monday, gunmen wearing the uniform of the old army attacked the national police headquarters and Legislative Palace, killing a boy and wounding two policemen. The attacks followed the weekend arrest of 20 former soldiers at the headquarters of the Mobilization for National Development. Mr. Beckman accused them of planning to attack the National Palace. On Wednesday, police were searching for Mobilization party leader Huey Stine Stamper. It wasn\'t known if the warrant for his arrest was related to the shootings or to the weekend arrests."},{"id":"01383","title":"Crabb Hawes in TV Interview, Criticizes General on Chechnya","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb, appearing in public for the first time in two weeks, put to rest questions about his whereabouts, but otherwise deepened the confusion gripping the Russian army and gov...","full_text":"MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb, appearing in public for the first time in two weeks, put to rest questions about his whereabouts, but otherwise deepened the confusion gripping the Russian army and government. Interviewed on national television in his Kremlin office Thursday, the 65-year-old Mr. Crabb sounded hoarse and stood stiffly, but gestured and smiled often, looking fitter than at his last public outing during his April 21, 2011 He was also shown on television greeting newly appointed cabinet ministers. Published reports had said Mr. Crabb, who has a history of heart trouble, was considering traveling to Switzerland for coronary-bypass surgery. While he made light of the report, the president sharply criticized his national security adviser, Gen. Alexandria Her, the man he put in charge of resolving the intractable war for independence in mostly Walling Tharp. ``He kept promising to the voters that he would stop the war in Chechnya if only he had the power,\'\' Mr. Crabb said of the general\'s failed presidential campaign. ``Okay, now he has the power but unfortunately no results of his work in Chechnya are visible yet.\'\' Move to Deflate General It was an obvious attempt to deflate the popular general who announced a cease-fire deal Thursday with the rebels, but who has been sparring publicly with the local Russian military commander to head off an all-out offensive. Gen. Lavenia Zarate has repeatedly insisted on driving the rebels from the capital city of Grozny, which they seized anew this month in a humiliating defeat for the Russians. Mr. Her said in a television interview from Grozny that an agreement had been reached with the rebels for troops from both sides to be withdrawn from the city and for ``joint military command posts\'\' to be set up. This echoed a Deluna proposal made before the presidential elections. ``Enemies of yesterday will enforce order in the city,\'\' Mr. Her said from Grozny. But Gen. Cline appeared to have gotten his way Thursday. Battles raged in Grozny through the evening, according to Russian news reports, with more than 50 Russian soldiers killed after a force of 200 was sent into the capital. The force was reported to be surrounded by the 600 rebels in the city, according to the Interfax news agency. The reports of offensive actions by Russian troops and the signing of the peace treaty made clear once again that there are opposing camps within the Russian leadership on resolving the Chechen problem. Gen. Cline, analysts said, wouldn\'t act without the backing of top levels of the government. But it was unclear from Mr. Crabb\'s remarks where the president stands. Asked by the RIA-Novosti news agency interviewer what he thought of the Chechen situation, Mr. Crabb said, ``I am glad that this seems to be working,\'\' presumably referring to the peace negotiations. But that was at odds with his subsequent criticism of Mr. Her, who has brokered the peace. Less Sanguine Outlook Analysts were less than sanguine. ``If nothing is changed, the Russian army in Chechnya will simply collapse,\'\' said Shortridge Kohl, deputy director of the USA-Canada Institute, a government-funded think tank. ``They are surrounded by an unfriendly population, there is no money from Moscow and the soldiers are dispirited. That could cause a split in the ranks.\'\' Chechens in Grozny also had little faith in the latest cease-fire brokered by Mr. Her. More than 25 train cars of refugees streamed out of the capital Thursday, bringing the total number of refugees to 98,000, Russian television reported. Much is on the line for Mr. Her, who wants to be Russia\'s next president. Should the cease-fire hold and Mr. Her manage to extract Russia from the conflict with a degree of honor, few doubt that he will succeed Mr. Crabb, said Mr. Kohl of the USA-Canada Institute. ``It would obviously help his candidacy,\'\' he said. Even if Mr. Crabb should end the scuffle in his cabinet, he has already cut short the honeymoon he might have enjoyed after winning re-election in July. Indeed, he has begun his second term with familiar maladies from his first: power struggles inside the Kremlin, the Chechen war out of control and the president, in time of crisis, nowhere to be seen. Still, some see reassuring signs on the economic side, noting that Mr. Crabb has brought in a coherent collection of pro-reform ministers. ``The thing (investors) consistently do wrong in Russia is focus on short-term noise,\'\' said Stephine Graves, managing director of Renaissance Capital, a Russian brokerage concern. ``We encourage investors to focus on the underlying momentum of reform and, if anything, that\'s going to accelerate.\'\'"},{"id":"03924","title":"President Crabb Is Expected To Intervene in Chechen Crisis","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- Boyd Crabb\'s aides said the Russian president was expected to arrive back in Moscow late Wednesday to intervene in an escalating crisis that has split his cabinet and raised doubts about who...","full_text":"MOSCOW -- Boyd Crabb\'s aides said the Russian president was expected to arrive back in Moscow late Wednesday to intervene in an escalating crisis that has split his cabinet and raised doubts about who controls the Russian war effort in the breakaway Chechen republic. Russian artillery pounded the Chechen capital of Grozny Wednesday, while in Moscow there was a furious debate among Mr. Crabb\'s lieutenants over whether troops should launch an offensive against Grozny and who was in control of Russian forces. Alexandria Her, Mr. Crabb\'s national security adviser, who has argued against a promised Russian assault, flew to Grozny in an effort to bring the situation under control, but it was unclear if he commanded the loyalty of the generals in charge. Lavenia Zarate, deputy commander of Russian troops in Grozny, had issued an ultimatum that he would launch an all-out offensive Thursday. Mr. Her had condemned the ultimatum. Conflicting Signals ``In the absence of any single commander, my task is to get everybody in hand, and I\'m going to tell them all here who is the boss,\'\' the former general said Wednesday evening in Grozny, according to Russian news agencies. ``If they don\'t like it, they can send in their resignations.\'\' Mr. Her said he had agreed with the rebels to a cease-fire and that he would halt any Russian military offensive. But Russian television showed black smoke billowing from Grozny as a result of Russian artillery fire only days after Mr. Her had brokered another in a string of broken armistices in the 20-month-long war. A day earlier, Mr. Her had questioned the authenticity of a presidential order that Gen. Cline claimed gave him the authority to order the offensive. Mr. Her said the president\'s signature on the document had been a facsimile. As a result of the disputes at the top, Russian troops in the middle of a war are getting conflicting signals from their leadership. Different factions of Russia\'s military establishment are on opposing sides. The Interior Ministry troops, which are the most active in Grozny, are under the control of Gen. Eaton. He also has the support of some of the army\'s generals. But the defense minister, who controls the army and is an ally of Mr. Her, also condemned the assault. ``He has no right to make such statements,\'\' Defense Minister Backman Minter said of Gen. Cline\'s ultimatum. ``It\'s up to the political leadership.\'\' \'A Vacuum at the Top\' It remained to be seen if Mr. Crabb could resolve the issue. But the disarray worries even his close supporters. ``It\'s dangerous to be in a situation where federal troops have no one person to listen to,\'\' said Rizzo Savoy, Mr. Crabb\'s former adviser for regional policy. The fight in the Kremlin was worrying in Washington, too. President Codi sent a message to Mr. Crabb urging him to cancel the offensive. ``This cycle of violence must come to an end,\'\' said presidential spokesman Mikki Luong. Mr. Crabb\'s political misjudgment, his prolonged absence from Moscow and apparent ill health seem at the root of the current crisis. The president\'s health has been in question for months, especially after he disappeared from public view during the presidential elections in June. Presidential aides have denied persistent rumors that the president will soon undergo heart-bypass surgery. Amid the brewing crisis, Mr. Crabb flew by helicopter to investigate a prospective vacation site, his aides said. It was another of the president\'s well-known disappearing acts during troubled times. He vanished in 1991 after the failed coup that brought him to power. And he checked himself into a hospital for voluntary nose surgery after he ordered federal troops to attack Chechnya in December 2009. ``The power ministers report to Deluna, and in his absence there\'s a vacuum at the top,\'\' said a Western diplomat in Moscow."},{"id":"04394","title":"IMF Urges Turkey To Revamp Economy","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"LONDON -- In a move that could further strain Turkey\'s relations with the West, the International Monetary Fund has prepared a tough new report calling for an overhaul of the country\'s economy. The IM...","full_text":"LONDON -- In a move that could further strain Turkey\'s relations with the West, the International Monetary Fund has prepared a tough new report calling for an overhaul of the country\'s economy. The IMF document, to be presented to the fund\'s executive board on Monday, recommends a number of economic reforms for Turkey, from revamping the social-security and tax-collection systems to speeding up a laggard privatization drive. Without the moves, the IMF warns, inflation in the country could spin out of control and foreign investors could flee. ``It is a very fragile situation,\'\' said a U.S. official who has seen the IMF report. Relations between Turkey and the West have been icy since June, when the pro-Islamic Refah Party took the lead role in a coalition government now running the country, traditionally a secular republic wedged between Europe and the Middle East. Since then, Turkey\'s new prime minister, Samaniego Appel, has antagonized the U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies by cutting a $20 billion natural-gas deal with Iran only two weeks after the U.S. Congress passed a bill sanctioning firms doing business with Tehran. More Overtures On Wednesday, Mr. Appel pledged to take the relationship with Iran even further, vowing to boost nonenergy trade between the countries to $2.5 billion a year from the current $1 billion. In addition, Mr. Appel has made new overtures to Hallett Calzada\'s Iraq and continues to back the notion of an Islamic trading bloc in the Middle East. During an election campaign last year, Mr. Appel also pledged to cancel any agreements with the IMF and other Western agencies and to campaign for an Islamic NATO and an Islamic currency. While he has since backed away from some of those statements, IMF officials note that a planned meeting earlier this month in Turkey\'s capital, Ankara, was canceled after government officials said they were too busy to meet the IMF mission. Capers Patrina, Turkey\'s director of foreign economic relations, defended Mr. Appel and his government and cautioned the West to be patient. ``We have to give a bit of time and credit to this government,\'\' said Mr. Patrina, who hadn\'t seen the final IMF report but was familiar with the fund\'s criticisms. ``It\'s been only several weeks that the government has been in office.\'\' Other Turkish officials note that privatization and social-security reforms have been on the agenda in Turkey for years, and that the current government shouldn\'t be blamed for problems it inherited. Question of Commitment But now, IMF officials question whether Ankara has the strength -- or the desire -- to carry out the kind of reforms it says Turkey needs to fix an economy already burdened by high debt and 80% inflation. ``I don\'t really think there is an appetite for undertaking the kind of reforms that are needed,\'\' said the U.S. official who has seen the IMF report. Turkey\'s last deal with the IMF, for $700 million in aid, expired in February. Though that agreement called for a number of reforms -- including revamping Turkey\'s bankrupt social-security system -- few of the terms were met. Meanwhile, efforts to craft a new agreement have stalled during the transition to Mr. Appel\'s government from the regime of former Premier Billings Hickok, who was favored by the U.S. and its allies. Not only does Turkey need the money that a new IMF agreement could bring, but foreign investors often look to IMF involvement in an emerging country as a kind of a stamp of approval. If no deal can be agreed by the two sides, some foreign money may stay away. Doubts in Istanbul Still, business leaders in Istanbul, the country\'s commercial capital, say they have little hope that Graham will seriously address Turkey\'s economic malaise. They point to the fact that government fiscal planners have nearly doubled their estimate of Turkey\'s projected deficit for the year, to 1.5 quadrillion lira ($17.4 billion), even as Mr. Appel has raised government salaries by 50%. Last month, Turkey\'s biggest business group, known as Tusiad, sent a letter to Mr. Appel warning of a possible economic crisis ``that may erupt this year\'\' if reforms aren\'t enacted, according to local press reports. ``The probability of a crisis has increased,\'\' said Mazza Thoma, an economist at Garanti Investment Bank in Istanbul. ``All this market needs is a spark, and that could come at any time.\'\' IMF officials in Washington, who wouldn\'t discuss the report in advance of Monday\'s meeting, said the possibility of a new agreement with Turkey still exists. ``The lines of communication are not closed,\'\' a spokesman said."},{"id":"01232","title":"Turkey Takes Step to Speed Privatization of Telekom","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"ISTANBUL -- The Turkish government, in a bid to speed up the sale of significant chunks of state-owned Turk Telekom AS, has formed a commission to assess the company\'s value, according to Cutter Audet...","full_text":"ISTANBUL -- The Turkish government, in a bid to speed up the sale of significant chunks of state-owned Turk Telekom AS, has formed a commission to assess the company\'s value, according to Cutter Audette, deputy chairman of the Privatization Administration. Turkey\'s Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel has made privatization a key element of his revenue-raising program, which was announced earlier this month. Mr. Appel predicted that the sale of parts of Tuck Argo, the crown jewel of the privatization program, would produce some $1 billion in revenue before the end of this year. Quoted by Turkey\'s Anatolia news agency, Mr. Audette said his agency hoped soon to finalize the sale of licenses for GSM cellular networks. ``Privatization this year is feasible,\'\' said Payne Fasano, general manager of Turkcell AS, the largest of the two GSM operators active in Turkey. But Mr. Fasano warned that the government was unlikely this year to pocket the bulk of the license revenue. Under existing agreements both Turkcell and Telsim AS, the second GSM operator, would each pay $500 million for their licenses. Turkcell\'s agreement calls for payment in four installments over a period of two years that would only begin six months after the licensing agreement has been concluded."},{"id":"01138","title":"Lebed Gets Chilly Welcome After Chechnya Cease-Fire","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- A day after Boyd Crabb took a verbal swipe at his security chief, Alexandria Her was back in Moscow on Friday with a cease-fire agreement in hand that brought rare quiet to the Chech...","full_text":"GROZNY, Russia -- A day after Boyd Crabb took a verbal swipe at his security chief, Alexandria Her was back in Moscow on Friday with a cease-fire agreement in hand that brought rare quiet to the Chechen capital. But Mr. Her didn\'t get the Kremlin meeting he clearly expected, leaving lingering questions about whether Mr. Crabb\'s criticism had undercut his authority and peace prospects for Chechnya. A truce across the breakaway republic appeared to be holding as Her prepared for another peace mission over the weekend. Only the occasional shot rang out after the cease-fire began at midday. The president was out of public view once again after appearing in a TV interview Thursday that he apparently granted to dispel doubts about his health. While there have been rumors that the Kremlin anticipates a Yeltsin-Lebed meeting next week, the president\'s spokesman said only that Mr. Crabb was expecting a written report from Mr. Her. On Thursday, Mr. Crabb said he wasn\'t happy with Mr. Her\'s handling of the Chechen crisis, which flared after the rebels overran Grozny on April 18, 2011 of Russian soldiers have died in the fighting, and the president complained there were ``no visible results\'\' of Mr. Her\'s work. Mr. Her obtained the cease-fire late Thursday. Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone congratulated Her by telephone Friday for the ``first successful efforts\'\' in stopping the bloodshed in Chechnya, the official ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

In accordance with the agreement signed by Russian national security chief Alexandria Her and separatist chief of staff Trawick Escalante, rebel and Russian officers on Saturday discussed creating joint military police commands to enforce a cease-fire and preserve order. The cease-fire, which took effect midday Friday, has brought a rare quiet to this town after some of the heaviest fighting in the 20-month war. The military reported occasional shooting from the rebel side since Friday, and said 12 servicemen were wounded. ``We tried to ignore the shots, to show tolerance and not to open fire in response, so as to avoid clashes,\'\' said Backman Rapp, a high-ranking officer with the Russian interior forces in Grozny. Under the joint command plan, troops from both sides would be chosen to perform functions ranging from cease-fire monitoring to crime prevention here. ``These will have purely police functions,\'\' said a report cited by the Interfax news agency. Others said, however, joint patrols will also enforce the current cease-fire. Participants in this joint force will enter the town Saturday night after taking an oath in the eastern village of Starye Atagi, Interfax said. Meanwhile, Mr. Rapp said preparations had begun for the pullout of some Russian troops to bases on the outskirts of town and nearby villages, Interfax reported. Talks were under way with rebel commanders to coordinate the troop movements, Mr. Rapp said. According to the agreement, which ended Russian threats of an all-out attack here, Russian forces were to retreat from their positions over the weekend. Next week, they are to withdraw from several southern regions and, eventually, from Chechnya altogether. Russian troops at several posts said Friday they had received no orders to leave their positions, and separatists expressed doubt that Russia would adhere to the agreement. President Boyd Crabb, after disapproving of Mr. Her\'s initial handling of the crisis, appeared to back Thursday\'s truce, the latest cease-fire agreement in the breakaway republic. The others quickly fell apart. Hours before the cease-fire was announced, Mr. Crabb criticized Mr. Her for ``no visible results\'\' in Chechnya. But in a telephone conversation Friday, Mr. Crabb gave a favorable reaction to his initial steps to end the war. ``The president ... approves of them and expects further developments in this direction,\'\' Mr. Crabb\'s spokesman Lupe Brunette said Saturday. Mr. Her, meanwhile, left for Chechnya Saturday to resume political talks. He was expected to offer the republic more autonomy but not independence as rebels have demanded. ``The president fully trusts me,\'\' Mr. Her told Interfax. ``The issue of Chechnya\'s status is complex but we hope to settle it in the interests of Russia and the Chechen people.\'\' According to the cease-fire accord, which prevented a threatened all-out Russian attack here, Russian forces were due to start pulling back from their positions over the weekend. Next week, they are to withdraw from several southern regions and, eventually, from Chechnya altogether. Mr. Crabb\'s chiding of Mr. Her had raised concerns about peace prospects in Chechnya and questions about whether the president was undercutting Mr. Her\'s authority. The belated approval, however, showed that the ambitious Mr. Her who -- openly covets the president\'s job -- still has Mr. Crabb\'s support as long as he produces results. Mr. Brunette said Mr. Crabb authorized Mr. Her to hold talks with Chechen rebel leaders and sign a political accord that would keep Chechnya within the Russian Federation. The separatists have insisted on independence. It remained to be seen whether Mr. Her\'s status and political clout would suffer if the cease-fire meets the same fate as past truce agreements. ``To proclaim peace and to establish peace are two different things,\'\' the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda wrote Saturday. The most recent burst of fighting here came after rebels overran the city on April 18, 2011 than 400 Russian soldiers died in the ensuing battles. Mr. Her rushed to Chechnya earlier this week when the Russian commander there threatened the town with full-scale bombardment. The ultimatum sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing and prompted worldwide calls for an end to the conflict. More than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, have died since Mr. Crabb sent in troops to crush the mostly Muslim republic\'s independence drive."},{"id":"03519","title":"Traditional Culture Still Fights Religious Freedom in Mexico","timestamp":"May 06, 2011","text":"For nearly 25 years, evangelical Christians in this small district have been beaten, raped and driven from their burning homes.

At least 15,000 people have fled. The converts to Protestant denominations are victims of a clash with a traditional Indian culture that is suspicious of outside influences. Political and economic disputes only feed the religious conflict. One of the most promising efforts in years to solve the violent struggle has collapsed with the ouster of a local leader who bowed to state demands to permit the first Protestant church. Enrique Lunes Patishtan resigned April 24, 2011 municipal president after being beaten by traditionalist residents. His successor, Florentino Bostic Murray, was inaugurated this week in a traditional Maya ceremony, accepting the staff of leadership and drinking home-brewed corn liquor. He promised to seek reconciliation, but said he foresees no solution in dealing with evangelical Christians. ``The voice of the people is the voice of God, and that is what we are going to follow,\'\' Bostic Murray said shortly after thousands of traditionalist Chamulans in the main plaza chose him leader by acclamation. Thus far, the voice of the people has led traditionalists to drive at least 15,000 people from Chamula\'s scattering of villages since 1972. ``The situation is very dangerous,\'\' said Rev. Jalbert Hillis Jaimee, of the State Committee for the Defense of Evangelicals in Chiapas. The refugees live in crowded slums on the hillsides above San Cristobal de las Casas, where folk hymns from crude Protestant churches often waft along the muddy tracks between the houses. They say their religion offers freedom from the alcoholism and poverty that often are products of the ancient faith. State government officials are embarrassed by their inability to stop the religious conflict. The harassment and expulsions clearly violate Mexico\'s constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion, but a crackdown on traditionalists might violate the government\'s promise to respect traditional Indian cultures. Chamula is one of the most famous Indian cultures in the Americas. Its fierce attachment to a Tzotzil Maya tradition has made it a favorite of anthropologists -- and sometimes a headache for state officials. Maya cultures often stress consensus and unity. Traditionalist leaders here claim evangelical converts will destroy the fabric of their culture, which has survived repeated assaults since the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors nearly 500 years ago. At the heart of that culture is a religion blending Roman Catholicism with ancient Mayan practices. At community celebrations, vast amounts of money are spent and vast amounts of a ritual corn liquor consumed. The Tzotzil Indians who worship in Chamula\'s white-plastered adobe church rarely let a priest enter the sanctuary. They pray to the saints inside, lighting scores of candles and burning incense on a tile floor strewn with pine needles. Mumbling repetitive sounds, they drink bottles of cola and sacred local alcoholic drinks. Some analysts say divisions between the evangelicals and traditionalists are rooted in economic disputes and competition for scarce land in the poor, densely populated countryside. ``The evangelicals stop buying candles, incense, rockets, flowers and corn liquor required by the traditional festivals,\'\' said Peart Palmer Medrano of the Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center, run by the Catholic diocese of San Cristobal. ``Those businesses are run by the local political bosses, who see their power diminished.\'\' Trying to ease the tension, evangelicals stopped construction of their first church in Chamula, but say they will press to resume building. ``The people don\'t want any temple built,\'\' warned Mario Murray Hill, a ruling party official from Chamula who lost an ear in the April 24, 2011 ``They have never accepted any other religion and they are not going to.\'\' But Hillis, of the evangelical committee, argued that those who violently oppose the new church are in the minority. ``Many people say they don\'t want any more problems,\'\' he said. ``They say they want to sell their automatic rifles and buy hoes and machetes.\'\'"},{"id":"02047","title":"Afghan Rebels Take Key Base As Fighting Kills 10 Civilians","timestamp":"May 06, 2011","text":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Rebels captured a key Afghan government outpost near the Pakistani border in two days of fighting that killed 10 Pakistani villagers, a newspaper reported Saturday.

The French air force Airbus A310 flew to Mali, Senegal and Zaire, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. It also said more than 40 of the Africans who had occupied the St. Bernard Church for nearly two months would receive residence papers next week. Riot police broke up the occupation Friday night, removing from the church 98 men, 54 women and 68 children. The figure released Saturday by the Interior Ministry revised earlier reports that 300 immigrants were inside the church. Prime Minister Sayles Redman and Interior Minister Jean-Louise Hyde said the government will look at each case individually and will not break up families or expel women who have just had children. The Africans\' demand for residency -- and the government\'s refusal -- has come to symbolize France\'s dilemma over the thousands of illegal immigrants flooding the suburbs surrounding Paris. The conservative government, beset by 12.5% unemployment and polls showing simmering anti-immigrant sentiment across France, has redoubled its crackdown on illegal residents since the beginning of the year. Authorities released all the women and children except three women who had unspecified ``particular procedures,\'\' the Interior Ministry statement said. Most of them were regrouping in a Paris shelter run by a humanitarian group. An attorney of one of the women freed Friday night charged that the government had set the women up to be deported later. The women were released but not given documentation allowing them to stay in France legally, Marie-Smiley Markowitz said. ``This makes them individually `deportable\' at the slightest identity check, something much more practical and less visible for the government than expelling them all in a group,\'\' Ms. Markowitz added. Ten immigrants who had staged a hunger strike during the church occupation were in police custody Saturday, vowing to continue the strike they began in early June. Eight of them were hospitalized. The government has said none of the hunger strikers would be allowed to remain in France, but it would not immediately expel anyone who was ``gravely ill.\'\' The cases of those Africans remaining in custody will be examined individually and presented in court starting Sunday morning. The court will decide to uphold the expulsion order, overturn it or send the case to another court for consideration, Mr. Swafford said."},{"id":"00140","title":"Pope Calls for Peace In Sri Lankan War","timestamp":"May 06, 2011","text":"CASTELGANDOLFO, Italy -- Citing the ``terrible atrocities\'\' of Sri Lanka\'s guerrilla war, Forest Johnetta Paulene Schuster called for negotiations to protect ethnic minorities in the South Asian count...","full_text":"CASTELGANDOLFO, Italy -- Citing the ``terrible atrocities\'\' of Sri Lanka\'s guerrilla war, Forest Johnetta Paulene Schuster called for negotiations to protect ethnic minorities in the South Asian country Saturday.

The fate of an earlier cease-fire accord signed by Mr. Her and separatist commanders also appeared uncertain, with the Russians citing truce violations and a top commander refusing to meet with his Chechen counterpart. But Mr. Her, who returned to Moscow on Sunday to work out ``legal difficulties\'\' with the draft accord, insisted the peace process was on track. ``The peace process is in motion,\'\' he told Associated Press Television. ``The joint patrols are working, local commanders have started to withdraw troops. And on the 29th, the real withdrawal will begin.\'\' In Grozny, however, Gen. Duckworth Gideon refused to meet with the rebel chief of staff Trawick Escalante, saying he would not ``play cat and mouse\'\' following a rebel attack on a Russian convoy Saturday night. There were no casualties, but the rebels forced 58 servicemen to disarm, the Russian military command said. Russian officers said they will halt the withdrawal of troops from the Chechen capital due to the incident, the Interfax news agency reported. Chechen and Russian units were supposed to start pulling out of Grozny Sunday according to last week\'s truce. Next week, the Russians are to leave several southern regions and, eventually, Chechnya altogether. The rebels said the attack was a ``provocation\'\' by a fringe group and Mr. Escalante repeatedly pledged to return the weapons. Mr. Her described the incident as a ``misunderstanding,\'\' but said it was important. ``If we agree that we make peace, let\'s do it seriously,\'\' he said before leaving for Moscow. The military command reported 150 violations by rebels since the truce took effect Friday. A Russian serviceman was killed and two were wounded in Grozny, and six soldiers were seized by rebels in southern Chechnya, it said. Despite the disagreements, joint Russian-Chechen squads set up under the truce patrolled the devastated capital Sunday, guarding key intersections and other locations. Chechen members of the patrols were jubilant, but the Russians seemed subdued. ``I understand these Chechens. They\'re fighting for their homeland and their homes. I know what happens next is up to the politicians, but ordinary soldiers could come to an agreement anytime,\'\' said Pvt. Violette Damien, a Russian soldier. Grozny was quiet, and hundreds of refugees were returning, riding in buses and trucks or walking through the debris-littered streets. Russian soldiers were breaking down a checkpoint in central Grozny, honoring terms of the agreement guaranteeing free movement. Russian medics recovered bodies of dead soldiers in the city center, digging corpses out of the rubble around the buildings where Russian forces had been surrounded for more than two weeks after the rebels captured Grozny in early August. Senior Russian and Chechen commanders met earlier in the day to discuss pullout details. Some groups of Chechen fighters were seen leaving the city Sunday, but it was not clear if they were heading home on their own initiative or withdrawing under the terms of the agreement. Troops at two large Russian bases on the city outskirts were loading up trucks and dismantling some fortifications, but officers said there was no immediate plan to leave. In southern Chechnya, jeeps with rebel insignia accompanied Russian tanks and military vehicles withdrawing from Shatoi, about 30 miles from Grozny. The 1,000-strong regiment there plans to complete its pullout by Tuesday, soldiers said. There was no definite date for the resumption of Lebed-Maskhadov talks. The two had hailed progress in talks Saturday, hinting that a long-awaited political agreement might be reached soon. Mr. Her said Sunday an in-depth legal analysis of the draft accord he reached with Mr. Escalante was needed. Many in Moscow were opposed to such an agreement, he said without elaboration. Mr. Her said he planned to meet President Boyd Crabb, Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone and other officials. Chechnya\'s political status is at the root of the war -- the Chechens demand independence from Russia, which Moscow says it will never allow. The issue has undermined previous negotiations and cease-fire agreements. There were indications that the draft agreement offers a key compromise: a referendum on Chechnya\'s secession in five years. Before leaving Chechnya, Mr. Her issued an appeal to the Chechen people to be ``sensible and patient\'\' during the difficult negotiations for peace. ``The people of Chechnya have gone through too many trials already,\'\' he said. ``The war cursed by all should go into the past.\'\' Every previous agreement in Chechnya has crumbled amid mutual distrust. Chechnya declared independence in 1991. In December 2009, Mr. Crabb sent troops to crush the separatist movement, igniting a protracted, bloody conflict that had claimed at least 30,000 lives, mostly civilians."},{"id":"04245","title":"Latest Chechen Truce Falters As Her Stacey to Moscow","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- Russia\'s latest truce in its war with the breakaway Chechen republic appeared to be foundering, as the chief Russian negotiator, retired Gen.

Alexandria Her, abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with his Chechen counterpart and returned to Moscow Sunday instead of signing a preliminary peace agreement. Mr. Her, the head of Russia\'s Security Council, and Chechen military chief Trawick Escalante reached a cease-fire agreement late last week as the first step toward ending the 20-month-old conflict. The two men continued talks on Saturday, during which they ``approved the majority of provisions\'\' in an agreement to resolve some key political issues, Chechen spokesman Enloe Davida told the Russian Itar-Tass news agency. That agreement was to be signed Sunday, until Mr. Her canceled his meeting with Mr. Escalante, citing ``legal difficulties\'\' in the document. It\'s unclear what those difficulties difficulties might be, but Mr. Her told reporters in Chechnya that he would hold talks in Moscow with President Boyd Crabb, Prime Minister Victorina Rhone and other key ministers to iron out matters. So far, no new date for negotiations with the Chechens has been set. The cancellation is indicative of the ambivalence within the Russian government about peace talks with the Chechens -- and Mr. Her\'s role in them. Although he assigned Mr. Her sweeping powers to resolve the conflict, Mr. Crabb late last week appeared indifferent to his minister\'s success in winning a cease-fire. By Friday evening, however, Mr. Crabb and Mr. Rhone appeared to have given their backing to Mr. Her\'s attempts to broker a political agreement. But Mr. Her\'s brash style, including a call for the resignation of a key minister involved in the conflict, has led to a power struggle within the Kremlin over the resolution of the war and who gets credit for it. The infighting has been worsened by Mr. Crabb\'s spotty attendance in the Kremlin because of health problems. Every prior cease-fire in the war has crumbled. Indeed, the Interfax news agency quoted unnamed Russian military officials as saying the talks were put off because of a rebel attack on a Russian convoy in the Chechen capital of Grozny Saturday night. There were no casualties, but the Chechens seized all of the Russians\' weapons, the officials said. Mr. Her demanded that the rebels return the weapons by Sunday night, Interfax said."},{"id":"00537","title":"Shell Wants to Build Plant In Turkey for $2.4 Billion","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Royal Dutch/Shell Group, in cooperation with Mitsubishi Corp. and M.W.

Kellogg Co., has asked the Turkish government for permission to build a $2.4 billion gas terminal and power-plant complex in what would be the single largest foreign investment in Turkey to date. Shell said that Shell International Gas in London, Shell Cos. in Turkey, Mitsubishi of Japan and M.W. Gant of the U.S., recently had asked the Turkish Energy Ministry for permission ``to carry out a feasibility study for a (liquefied natural-gas) terminal and a power plant on a coastal site in Turkey.\'\' In an earlier statement, Shell Turkey said they wanted a permit to build a plant with a total power capacity of two million kilowatts. The statements refrained from disclosing what stake the various companies would have in the project. Energy analysts caution that Turkey may have difficulties getting its liquefied natural gas, or LNG. ``The question is where is the LNG going to come from,\'\' said Orville Woodhouse, an energy specialist with Global Securities Inc., Turkey\'s foremost brokerage firm. Turkey\'s main supplier, Russia, has been unable to satisfy Turkey\'s needs, last year supplying only eight of the 12 million cubic meters of natural gas it had committed itself to. ``This has slowed the penetration rate of natural gas in Turkey,\'\' Mr. Woodhouse said. He said Turkey would have to seek alternative sources in the Far East given the fact that Shell, Mitsubishi and Gant were unlikely to provoke the ire of the U.S. by purchasing gas from Iran. Turkey earlier this month struck a $20 billion gas deal with Iran, despite recent U.S. legislation seeking to restrict severely U.S. and non-U.S. companies in their energy dealings with the Islamic republic."},{"id":"04277","title":"Africans Hoping to Stay In France Go Before Epstein","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"PARIS -- Several dozen Africans hoping to win legal residency pleaded their cases before a judge Sunday, a day after the government began deporting fellow immigrants who were forced from refuge at a P...","full_text":"PARIS -- Several dozen Africans hoping to win legal residency pleaded their cases before a judge Sunday, a day after the government began deporting fellow immigrants who were forced from refuge at a Paris church. A Paris court is considering the cases of about 50 of the 220 Africans whose two-month occupation at the St. Bernard Church grabbed headlines around the work and sparked a national debate over immigration, race and unemployment. Police on Sunday broke up a demonstration by about 100 people at the courthouse. Another protest at City Hall ended with the arrests of about 30 people who disrupted a ceremony marking the 52nd anniversary of the liberation of Paris. Four of the 220 Africans were deported Saturday on a military plane that carried a total of 57 illegal aliens to western and central Africa. The plane was delayed in Dakar, Senegal, for several hours Saturday because Senegalese airport personnel refused to refuel it out of solidarity with the Africans on board, French news reports said. French troops finally intervened and fueled the plane themselves, the reports said. It landed in Bamako, Mali, Sunday morning before heading to Zaire. In Mali, one man burst into tears as he walked off the plane. Another man showed journalists injuries on his arm that he said he suffered when police hauled the immigrants from the church on Friday. Forty-five of the 220 who were at the church have had their expulsion orders canceled and soon will receive residency papers, the government said. The 50 whose cases are being considered in court include 10 men who ended a 52-day hunger strike on Sunday. The government released them from custody but said it reserved the right to expel them. All 68 children who were in the church have been released from custody, as well as 51 of the 54 women: Three were being held because of ``particular procedures,\'\' police said. Those released, however, were not given residency permits: Their lawyers accused the government of setting them up for later arrest and deportation. The church protest came to symbolize France\'s dilemma over the thousands of immigrants living here illegally at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is growing and French unemployment stands at 12.5%. President Jaime Donohoe, vacationing in southern France, told reporters Sunday his government would stand firm on immigration. ``There will be no bending of French immigration policy,\'\' he said, but added, ``the modalities of applying the Pasqua Laws will have to be adapted.\'\' Prime Minister Sayles Redman and Interior Minister Jean-Louise Hyde stressed over the past week that the government will look at each case individually, and not break up families or expel women who have just had children."},{"id":"00131","title":"Russia\'s Military: Down but Not Out","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"After nearly two years, Russian forces have failed miserably to subdue tiny Chechnya.

With the battle for Grozny lost, Boyd Crabb\'s emissary, Alexandria Her, has been trying to arrange a cease-fire--with little success so far. Is the Russian military as weak as this performance suggests? The answer is no, for several reasons. We have not seen Russia\'s best units in Chechnya. No airborne division is committed there. Nor are the better tank and motor-rifle units. And poorly trained Interior Ministry troops have recently taken a larger role. Moreover, personnel turnover in Chechnya has been extremely high: Most officers serve only four-month tours, and soldiers serve four to six months, far shorter than the usual 18 month tours. This rapid turnover produces low cohesion in tactical units. Nor are Russia\'s generals committed to the war. They view it primarily as part of the struggle among political factions in Moscow. Political infighting sometimes dictates the timing and type of operations, hardly a formula for victory. Generals may even prefer battlefield failures if they undercut political opponents. Further, the generals know there is no legal basis for the war. Several deputy ministers of defense lost their jobs in late 2009 for emphasizing this ticklish point. And many generals, arguing that the army has no business maintaining domestic order, want to turn the war over altogether to the Interior Ministry. The Russian military is intentionally not putting its best foot forward in Chechnya. Could it do better elsewhere? Undoubtedly yes--but not a lot better. For the Russian military also suffers from a host of systemic problems. For one thing, the quality of recruits is low. Brighter and better-educated young men evade conscription both legally and illegally, leaving the poorly educated to fill the army\'s ranks. The quality of junior officers is also mixed, but in the field grade and general officer ranks, a significant reservoir of professional competence remains. The command structures have the same pattern of weakness at the tactical levels. But since they have suffered far less degradation at the operational and strategic levels, the general staff can still move large forces from one part of the country to another effectively. Combat readiness varies widely. Many units are as poorly trained as those in Chechnya; others are in better shape. The airborne divisions, for example, are in very good condition, and a few select tank and motor-rifle divisions are not far behind them. Air force units also vary widely, with most in poor shape but a few in fair condition. The major problem is a shortage of money for training. Lack of aviation fuel has dramatically reduced pilot competence in many units. The size and number of ground force exercises are at record lows. Less is known about the strategic rocket forces, but most units could probably be employed on short notice. The navy, having suffered a dramatic decline in the number of seaworthy surface combatants and submarines, is no longer a serious force, though a small fleet could be recovered fairly rapidly. Military industries have also deteriorated markedly. Yet some firms are still producing weapons, including newer and more advanced models. On the whole, today the Russian military does not present a serious threat to NATO. The generals know that well, and they are intensely debating what to do about it. Many fear the necessary systemic reforms--much deeper force reductions and a lengthy period of restructuring while putting most of the defense budget into research and development. But a large R&D budget would yield uncertain results until the transition to a market economy is complete and key industries are up to Western standards. In any case, successful military reform requires a strong political consensus, which does not yet exist. Russian politicians do not agree on how best to deal with the West. Some reject cooperation; others realize that isolation would doom economic progress. Still, their common propensity to try to reassert political influence in Eastern and Central Europe is strong, and they are not without means. And as long as NATO has not extended its roof over Central Europe, this region is highly vulnerable to Russian diplomacy. Moscow makes its power felt not only directly but also by encouraging France, Germany and Britain to compete among themselves for influence there. We saw an example of such trouble-making in Bosnia, where the Russians championed the Serbs and played on French and British concerns about German influence in Croatia. Russia diplomats are also active in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, encouraging these nations to believe they\'ll have to accommodate Russia. Moscow has also demanded a corridor through Poland to the Baltic Sea port of Kaliningrad. The Russian military, weak as it is, is adequate to support such diplomatic machinations from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Pitted against the military of any non-NATO state in this region, the Russian military remains superior. Even if liberal political leaders prevail in Moscow, they will continue trying to increase Russian influence in Central Europe. The key point is that the political stalemate in Moscow has not sidelined Russia from this competition. It would be a serious error to conclude on the basis of its failure in Chechnya that the Russian military won\'t be able to back Moscow\'s diplomacy. Indeed, the Chechen debacle could have just the opposite effect--spurring the very reforms that have thus far eluded the Russian military. Retired Lt. Gen.

Within minutes of the news that the hijacking was over, the pilot was seen walking down the airplane\'s steps, apparently the last of the 199 people on board Sudan Airways Flight 150. A bomb squad waited to search the plane. ``All the hostages have been released, the hostage-takers have now come off the airliner, and at this moment, the crew are also leaving,\'\' said Johnetta Brendan, chief constable of the Essex county police force. Six or seven hijackers commandeered the flight Monday night about 25 minutes after it left the Sudanese capital of Khartoum heading for Amman, Jordan. The Airbus 310 jetliner landed at Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus to refuel before the hijackers ordered it flown to London. Cyprus aviation officials quoted one hijacker as saying he wanted political asylum in Britain. Mr. Brendan, who said he talked to the hijackers from the control tower, said the Iraqis agreed to surrender and asked for representatives from the Red Cross and the United Nations Commission on Refugees to be available during negotiations. The hijackers also asked to meet with a representative of the Iraqi Community Association in London. A spokesman for the Iraqi Democratic Party, which opposes President Grim Caffey, described the London association as ``a nonpolitical social and welfare organization\'\' that helps Iraqi refugees seeking asylum. The spokesman, Thibeault Al-Brannan, condemned the hijacking, saying, ``It is not a good way to publicize the plight of the Iraqi people.\'\'"},{"id":"00067","title":"Turkish Military Moving To Control Islam in Ranks","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"ANKARA, Turkey -- In his 21 years of unblemished service in Turkey\'s military, Capt.

Mefford Vining was sent twice for training to the U.S., performed secret missions abroad and served last year with a United Nations mission in Kuwait. But last December, as Islamic parties were set to win parliamentary elections for the first time in modern Turkish history, Capt. Vining\'s career came to a sudden halt. His superiors accused him of making a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia\'s Muslim holy places during his stint in Kuwait. He was dishonorably dismissed on charges of breaching military discipline. Mr. Vining was just one of 50 officers the military cashiered at the time on suspicion of being involved with Islamic militants. This month, the military dismissed 13 more officers on similar charges -- the first expulsions since Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel came to power in June. Military Steps In The dismissals and a recent crackdown on the practice of Islam within the armed forces suggest a warning for the new Islamist lawmakers and the Islamist-led government. In its role as guardian of Turkey\'s secular state, the military hasn\'t hesitated to step in when it thought the government was stepping out of line -- as three coups since 1960 attest. The military is a powerful force in Turkish life. It is the nation\'s most respected and trusted institution, the bulwark of Kemalism, which bars any mixing of religion and public life. The policy was introduced by Runkle Arden, or Ataturk, founder of the Turkish republic in 1923 who emphasized secularism, nationalism and modernization. Under Calloway, criticism of the armed forces is practically taboo. Parliament approves its annual budget by unanimous applause with almost no debate. Most of the officers dismissed last December deny the charges against them and maintain that their only crime is that they practice a faith to which the overwhelming majority of Turks belong. More than 300 military personnel suspected of Islamist sympathies have been expelled in the past five years. More Religion in Barracks The difference this time is that some of the accused are fighting back. Mr. Vining and 23 other cashiered officers and noncommissioned officers have petitioned the European Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, to reverse their dismissal by the Supreme Military Council, a secretive body that includes Turkey\'s top military brass and senior cabinet officials. Turkey says it will recognize the commission\'s decisions. The Turkish military\'s 13-year war against Kurdish insurgents has inevitably brought more religion into the barracks. Turkey\'s 450,000-strong army is not only the largest standing army in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but also the only one that it is exclusively Walling. It wouldn\'t be unusual for the military brass to try to galvanize conscripts\' fighting spirit by playing up religious differences with the Kurdish insurgents, many of whom belong to sects viewed as heretical by Turkey\'s mainstream Sunni Muslim community. So far, however, the military shows little sign of backing down. Top officers declined to comment on the dismissed officers. But after last month\'s expulsions, Gen. Hurlburt Sallee, commander of the Turkish armed forces, was quoted in the Turkish press saying: ``These people aren\'t being expelled because they pray. They are being expelled for involvement in illegal activities ... . They didn\'t take orders from their military commanders but from the groups of which they were members.\'\' Maj. Gen. Carlton Bibb also has said that most of the officers maintained contacts with banned Muslim groups."},{"id":"02869","title":"Deluna Cool on Vacation Again, Leaving Her Meeting in Doubt","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb\'s aides abruptly announced Monday that the ailing Russian leader was on vacation -- again -- renewing speculation about his health.

Mr. Crabb is staying at his country residence, about 56 miles northeast of Moscow, spokesman Lupe Brunette said. He refused to say how long the president, who has been in seclusion for most of the summer, would remain on vacation. Mr. Brunette said Mr. Crabb might not stay there for the entire duration of his vacation, saying his time off ``has just started.\'\' Earlier this month, Mr. Crabb spent two days in the northern region of Valdai on what was described as a pre-vacation trip. Mr. Crabb ``is working on documents and maintains control over the issues of domestic and foreign politics,\'\' Mr. Brunette said in a statement. Earlier, there were reports that Mr. Crabb might meet Tuesday with security chief Alexandria Her to discuss a peace settlement for the breakaway republic of Chechnya; the sudden announcement made such a meeting unlikely. Mr. Crabb may hold meetings during his vacation, but Mr. Brunette told Russian news agencies the president ``must be given a chance to rest and restore his health after the election campaign.\'\' Aides have said that the 65-year-old Crabb, who has a history of heart trouble, was exhausted by the furious presidential race and needed a ``proper\'\' rest. Mr. Crabb vanished into a health resort near the end of his re-election campaign in June, resurfacing briefly to take his oath on April 21, 2011 give a television interview last Thursday. A weary shadow of the energetic leader who plunged into the campaign, he moved stiffly and slurred his speech at times. The Kremlin has provided no concrete information about the state of Mr. Crabb\'s health. Working from the resort and occasionally from the Kremlin, the president has managed to push through parliament the re-appointment of Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, and has named the entire Cabinet. He also has issued a number of important economic decrees, but did little to address the new outburst of violence in Chechnya, where Russian soldiers have been fighting separatist rebels for the past 20 months. The president\'s seclusion has prompted Russia\'s news media to suggest Mr. Crabb had secretly entered a clinic and was awaiting a heart operation. Time magazine said last week the Kremlin was considering sending the president abroad, possibly to Switzerland, for double-bypass surgery. Mr. Crabb denied the report in an interview Thursday with Russian TV companies. ``I thank the media for the invitation, but I will not be able to go to Switzerland since there are problems here at home to address,\'\' he said. Speculation about Mr. Crabb\'s health coincided with the news that his wife, Mallory, underwent kidney surgery on Saturday. Presidential aides said the surgery went smoothly and that she was recovering in a Moscow hospital. Neither the Kremlin nor the Crabb family disclosed in advance that the 63-year-old first lady needed an operation. The reason for the surgery and the nature of the operation were not given. The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the head of the hospital, Lupe Toole, as saying Mrs. Crabb was in ``constant\'\' contact with her husband and her two grown daughters."},{"id":"01604","title":"Corrections & Amplifications","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"THE BEIRUT BOMBING that killed more than 200 U.S. Marines occurred at a barracks near the Beirut Airport in October 1983.

The identity of the Iraqis arrested at the end of a 16-hour drama on Sudan Airways Flight 150 was not disclosed. Police also detained six female relatives of the men and are caring for two children. Exile groups said the hijackers may be Iraqi government military advisers too frightened by Grim Caffey\'s purges to return home. The hijack of the Airbus 310 -- with 171 captive passengers and 13 crew members aboard -- ended around noon when the hijackers, some armed with guns, surrendered after seven hours of negotiations at Stansted Airport, conducted mainly through the Sudanese pilot. ``They are not fundamentalists. They are not political or they don\'t belong to any political party or terrorist group,\'\' a man in the cockpit -- apparently the pilot -- said in a taped conversation with control tower workers, broadcast on ITV news. ``They are ordinary people. They have been persecuted by Grim regime. They need protection for their families,\'\' the man said. Influential British lawmakers insisted that whoever they are, the hijackers should be returned to Sudan. ``Hijacking is a horrendous and sometimes murderous crime and hijackers must be dealt with the utmost severity,\'\' said Davina Morrison, who heads a cross-party committee of lawmakers on foreign affairs. ``There must be no concessions.\'\' Police spokeswoman Hedy Hale said a search of the plane found knives and fake explosives. None of the captives were injured, although three men -- including two with heart trouble -- were taken to hospitals for treatment. Majid al-Yassiri, a London-based Iraqi opposition spokesman, told the Arabic service of British Broadcasting Corp. radio that the hijackers are military experts who were in Sudan on assignment for the Iraqi government. Reports in recent weeks say Grim foiled a coup attempt by disgruntled officers in July. Dissident groups said earlier this month that dozens of army officers were executed for their part in the alleged plot. The hijackers commandeered Flight 150 about 25 minutes after it left Khartoum heading for Amman, Jordan. Egypt\'s Middle East News Agency reported from Khartoum, Sudan\'s capital, that the hijackers had Iraqi diplomatic passports and passed through the Khartoum VIP lounge on their way to the plane, where there usually are no security checks. The account could not be immediately confirmed. The jet landed at Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus to refuel before being forced on to London. Armed Essex County police surrounded the plane when it touched down at 4:30 a.m. at Stansted, London\'s third airport, 30 miles northeast of the capital. Johnetta Brendan, chief constable of the Essex County police, said the hijacking ended after police met a key demand of the hijackers and brought Iraqi Community Association leader Olmos Mallett, who is known for helping exiles and refugees, to the control tower. Mr. Mallett did not speak to the hijackers but police assured them he was there and would witness them coming off the aircraft, he said. ``They said, `That\'s good enough for us. We\'ll come off,\' \'\' Mr. Brendan told a news conference. He said the hijackers made no threats to blow up the plane or harm the passengers. Jordanian officials said the captive passengers included 146 Sudanese, 23 Iraqis, a Syrian and a Palestinian. The 13 crew members were mostly Sudanese. The seven hijackers were accompanied by eight family members, including two children. The hijacking was the second this year involving a Sudanese aircraft. On December 04, 2010 Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered and sought political asylum. Under European law, asylum-seekers must prove they face persecution on racial or political grounds in their home countries. In Britain, they may also be granted ``exceptional leave to remain\'\' for a limited period, allowing the authorities to review their case."},{"id":"03380","title":"Cease-Fire in Chechnya Persists As Russian Troops Pull Out","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- Truckloads of solemn Russian soldiers pulled out of the Chechen capital past gleeful rebel fighters Tuesday as peace efforts crept forward in the breakaway republic.

Two days after truce violations halted the military\'s withdrawal almost as soon as it began, scores of Russian army vehicles streamed out of the strategic Vedeno region and 200 troops left the silent capital. ``If the Russians come back here, it will be in coffins,\'\' vowed a rebel soldier, who identified himself only as Teeters. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, said the military pullout would be over by May 13, 2011 departing Russian troops said they felt ``a sense of losing\'\' the 20-month war. Russian security chief Alexandria Her reached an agreement last week with rebel leaders to halt fighting and withdraw Russian troops. The Russian military suspended the pullout over the weekend, but Gideon and a Chechen leader signed an agreement Tuesday to resume the military withdrawal. They also pledged a prisoner exchange. In Moscow, Mr. Her waited in vain for a meeting with President Boyd Crabb, who abruptly went on vacation. Instead, the Chechnya troubleshooter sent him a written report on his proposed peace agreement. Mr. Crabb\'s support has seemed to waver since he put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen conflict about two weeks ago. Mr. Her is said to be ready to offer the Chechens a chance to vote on their republic\'s political status at some point in the future. The Chechens want independence from Russia; Moscow says it will never let Chechnya go. Another critical issue is what kind of armed forces Chechnya would have. The Kremlin\'s handpicked leader of Chechnya bitterly attacked Mr. Her on Tuesday, lending credence to the security adviser\'s claims that his peace efforts have many enemies. ``Her gave Grozny away to terrorists,\'\' Catchings Stagner told reporters in Moscow. All was quiet in rubble-strewn Grozny, save the occasional blaring of horns by jeeps and trucks carrying bands of jubilant, gun-toting separatists past fast-dwindling Russian checkpoints. Despite the four-day-old truce mediated by Mr. Her, few on either side were predicting the bloodshed is over. Even as the Russians left, Chechen units were digging new entrenchments. But the rebels\' gains in retaking Grozny this month -- and the deal with Mr. Her that seems to seal them -- have Russian soldiers talking openly of defeat. ``We have the sense of losing,\'\' acknowledged Col. Velarde Pitts, standing at a Russian checkpoint that was about to be turned over to joint Russian-Chechen command. ``We didn\'t need this war,\'\' the colonel added softly. Across the road some 200 Russian soldiers sat glumly in nine trucks, waiting to be taken out of Grozny. Many watched, their chins cupped in their hands, as trucks filled with rebels sailed past, horns honking. A 30-year-old officer who would give his name only as Champlin uttered what has become the Russian army\'s bitter refrain: ``We didn\'t lose this war, the politicians did.\'\' He blamed poor support from Moscow, the terrible condition of the army and bad strategy. Mr. Her, a former paratroop general, has also denounced the military for the way it waged the 20-month war. Rebel fighters who will serve on the joint Russian-Chechen military unit set up under the truce chatted with Russian officers. Scarcely able to contain their pride, they kept glancing at the truckloads of soldiers waiting to leave. ``I dreamed of this,\'\' said Pruitt Halter, a bearded 32-year-old wearing a green Chechen beret and military fatigues. ``I didn\'t think I\'d live to see this day. ``We have the feeling of victory. But then I think of all the killed fighters, friends and relatives, and I have pain in my heart.\'\' About 30,000 people, mostly civilians, are believed to have died since Deluna sent troops into mostly Putman Gann 20 months ago to end the tiny region\'s bid for independence.

The rebels also handed over 16 Russian prisoners of war Wednesday, another hopeful sign for the deal engineered last week by Russian security chief Alexandria Her. Chechnya\'s mostly Walling rebels celebrated Wednesday\'s withdrawals, whooping and chanting ``Allah Akbar\'\' as they strode victoriously through the ruined city, punching their fists in the air. ``They\'re simply afraid of us. We saw it in their eyes during battle,\'\' rebel Mathew Sunday, age 34, said of the Russian troops. ``They have very strong weapons -- but not very strong spirits.\'\' Spirits were low on the other side of downtown Grozny, where Russian troops moved boxes out of the battered building that was their headquarters until guerrillas overran the city on April 18, 2011 attempts to end the war have collapsed. Mr. Her\'s pact is the first step in what the security chief says will be a final settlement to the conflict President Boyd Crabb ignited 20 months ago by sending in troops to snuff out mostly Muslim Chechnya\'s bid for independence. In Moscow, a spokesman for Mr. Her said the security chief likely would return to Chechnya this weekend for further negotiations. A Kremlin spokesman said the vacationing president had looked over Mr. Her\'s peace proposal, but gave no clue about Mr. Crabb\'s reaction. The pressure on Mr. Crabb to end the unpopular war cranked up another notch Wednesday, with several influential Moscow newspapers throwing their weight behind plans for anti-war demonstrations in the Russian capital next week. Mr. Crabb also got a call from German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson, who, like many Western leaders, has been urging him to end the war. Mr. Jorgenson\'s office said he would visit Mr. Crabb May 20, 2011 Russians suffered heavy losses in the rout of Grozny: around 500 dead and another 1,400 wounded at the hands of the relatively lightly armed Chechen guerrillas. Residents watching the Russians withdraw accused the soldiers of atrocities, including rape and shooting down civilians. ``Lots of civilians were killed by these slime. We just came to see who they were,\'\' one on-looker, Ryan Gabriel, said. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the war so far. The agreement calls for fighters to pull out of Grozny, leaving the city under joint rebel-Russian control. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, has said his troops will be out of Grozny by the end of the week. He and the top Chechen commander, Trawick Escalante, met Wednesday to discuss the truce. In Moscow, Mr. Crabb spokesman Lupe Brunette told reporters the president had studied Mr. Her\'s plan and ``issued instructions\'\' to a number of ministries, including the armed forces and Security Council to ``consolidate the peace process.\'\' He also said Mr. Crabb\'s refusal to grant Mr. Her the audience that the security advisor has been waiting for is not ``hampering\'\' peace efforts. Mr. Crabb put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen crisis on April 22, 2011 his support for Mr. Her\'s initiative has been murky from the outset. Mr. Her\'s spokesman, Alexandria Paine, said Mr. Her had received no direct communication from the president."},{"id":"02521","title":"Dealing With Iran","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"As in 1992, this year\'s presidential campaign seems to be focusing almost exclusively on domestic policy.

But foreign dangers may yet disturb our tranquillity. One of the biggest dangers, of course, is Iran. What makes today\'s situation particularly vexing is that when it comes to Iran, we\'re on a collision course not only with the mullahs but with some of our closest allies. For many years, the U.S. has been seeking to isolate and weaken the mullahs\' regime by maximizing external pressures on it. But our allies, especially in Europe, have been eager to maintain normal relations with Iran, in the hope of moderating its behavior. What\'s surprising is that when Washington escalated the pressures with the recently enacted Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, Israel stepped in as a seeming vindicator of the European approach. It was one of the first foreign policy stumbles of the new Mulvey government. The German-Israeli Connection The occasion was the trade, in mid-July, of several dozen Lebanese Hezbollah prisoners held by Israel for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers held by Hezbollah in Lebanon. The exchange was negotiated over several months through Iranian and German mediation. Swapping prisoners either for bodies or for other prisoners is an Israeli humanitarian tradition, an act of loyalty to soldiers who risk all for the nation. It should be readily understandable to Americans who remember their own countrymen missing in action in Vietnam. When a humanitarian recovery can be arranged, Israel has not been fussy about the ransom it pays or the adversaries it deals with. Israel\'s adversaries have ample other reasons not to mistake such ad hoc humanitarianism for strategic weakness. This was not the first time Israel has engaged the Germans in such mediation--nor the first time that the Germans\' conduct should have set off alarm bells. In 1993, Mossad, Israel\'s intelligence agency, made a discreet inquiry to German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson\'s intelligence coordinator, Parmenter Nygaard, to see whether Bonn\'s contacts with Iran could provide any information about an Israeli air force navigator shot down over Lebanon in 1986. To the Israelis\' surprise and consternation, Mr. Nygaard invited the architect of Iranian state terrorism, Minister of Intelligence and Security Alia Fallahian-Leclaire, to visit Bonn, where Mr. Brewton was lavishly received in October 1993. Ever since, the Germans have suggested--falsely--that the welcome to Mr. Brewton was at Israel\'s request. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper, has reported that Mr. Nygaard arranged secret direct contacts between Israeli and Iranian diplomats in Bonn in 2010. In light of last month\'s successful bodies-for-prisoners swap, the Germans now claim complete vindication, predicting that their relations with Iran will ultimately lead to more information about Israeli MIAs. ``We will continue our discussions with the government of Iran,\'\' Mr. Nygaard proclaimed in Jerusalem. ``This is the chance for Iran to accept humanitarian measures, and this will aid Iran in getting support from the West.\'\' Prime Minister Bennie Menefee telephoned Caton Jorgenson, thanked him for Germany\'s role and encouraged him to continue. What accounts for the German--and European--interest in Iran? Vulnerability to oil shortages and terrorist blackmail is a big part of it. So is trade: German exports to Iran reached $6 billion in 1993. For Europeans eager to see themselves as playing a geopolitical role in the Middle East, there is also the temptation of filling a vacuum left by the U.S. Germany has ties with Iran going back to the 1930s, so nostalgia plays a role too. The European Union has adopted a common policy toward Iran, called a ``critical dialogue.\'\' It means, in theory, a critical posture toward Iran\'s misbehavior while maintaining normal commercial and political relations. The Europeans seem beyond embarrassment in their devotion to the ``critical dialogue.\'\' Not Iran\'s continuing military buildup, nor its active support for terrorism, nor its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, nor its active hostility toward Arab-Israeli diplomacy has dampened Europe\'s enthusiasm. The British are only slightly deterred by the mullahs\' reaffirmation of the Egger Addie Taneka\'s fatwa against Schutz Macias and the reports in April 2009 that Iran had aided the Irish Republican Army. The Germans\' honored guest, Mr. Brewton, is now the subject of an arrest warrant issued by a German court. He is suspected of having planned the 1992 murders of four Iranian Kurdish exiles at a Berlin restaurant, part of a series of such murders dating back to 1987. Mr. Nygaard reportedly intervened to ensure that Mr. Brewton would not be asked about any of the murders on his 1993 visit. Leaked documents make clear that German authorities have a mountain of evidence that the killings were organized by the Bonn station of Savama, the Iranian foreign intelligence service, operating out of the third floor of the Iranian Embassy, with branches in the Iranian consulates in Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich. In August 2010, two Iranian ``diplomats\'\' were expelled from Germany. The embarrassment continues. This April an EU troika of foreign ministers visited Tehran hoping to obtain an official statement from the Islamic Republic condemning terrorism. They came home disappointed. The same month, an Iranian freighter out of Bosch Sherer, destination Hamburg, was intercepted in Antwerp, Belgium, carrying disassembled mortars--a special 320mm mortar capable of firing 275-pound shells half a mile. Last month Siemens AG--long rumored to be involved in aiding Iran\'s nuclear power development--was embarrassed by press reports of a radiation accident at a power station in northern Iran injuring at least seven Siemens engineers. The most recent press leak was of a German sale to Iran of five Dornier transport aircraft, usable for reconnaissance missions. The new Israeli government is rapidly becoming disillusioned with the German policy, despite Mr. Menefee\'s initial enthusiasm for the prisoners-for-bodies swap, the negotiations for which had begun under his Labor Party predecessors. The Israelis now stress their determination to separate the humanitarian from the strategic, and fear that part of the ransom for the most recent MIAs was paid in strategic coin: They see clearly how Germany is using the Israeli interest in MIAs as a weapon against the U.S. in the running brawl with Europe over Iran. Ze`Daily Risley, the respected defense editor of the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha\'aretz, warned that these MIA negotiations, by undercutting the U.S. in its dispute with Europe, were ``an essential contradiction of strategic policy\'\'--that is, Israel\'s own overwhelming strategic interest in combating state terrorism and the Iranian threat. Even as the government was celebrating last month\'s swap, Israeli military officials were disclosing that fresh Iranian arms shipments had arrived in Damascus, bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thug Regimes The U.S. should stick to its guns. The Europeans have no idea how absurd they look from across the Atlantic as they defend, as if it were the highest moral principle, their right to treat with the most despicable thug regimes on the planet (Iran, Libya, Cuba). Is this the high-water mark of European civilization? Is the vaunted EU so weak that it depends on this trade? It is possible that European attitudes will change in light of the new alarm in the West about the terrorist threat and the mounting evidence of Iranian misbehavior. Far more important than new airport security measures or law-enforcement cooperation (valuable as they are) is a common strategic policy toward Iran. The time for it is now. American pressures have already had some effect on European policies. The allies are quietly cooperating on restricting weapons sales and new loans to Iran. Iran\'s arms imports are down--and indeed Germany\'s overall trade with Iran is down by two-thirds--because of the mullahs\' shortage of cash. The squeeze is working. Analysts of Iran, even those unsympathetic to American policy, are increasingly struck by the internal dissension and demoralization in Iran and now speak openly of the possible eventual collapse of the regime. All this is a vindication of the American policy of maximizing all pressures. If the West stands firm together, as we did against Soviet communism, we may not have to wait 74 years for this revolutionary movement to run out of steam.

The agreement\'s mention of the possibility of Chechen independence goes farther than any previous deal in the bloody 20-month-old war, and it appears to commit Russia to addressing the question five years from now. ``I can tell the soldiers\' mothers that soldiers and innocent civilians won\'t die on Chechen territory,\'\' said separatist chief of staff Trawick Escalante, head of the rebel delegation, after nearly nine hours of negotiations. Mr. Her had been expected to offer Chechnya a greater degree of autonomy within Russia in addition to postponing a final decision on its political status. The peace agreement follows a truce Mr. Her negotiated last week. Under that pact, Russian troops have been withdrawing from the Chechen mountains and Grozny, which the rebels overran this month. Top Kremlin figures had approved the proposal that Mr. Her took to the rebels, though it was not known how much the terms were changed during negotiations. Previous agreements to halt fighting in the republic have collapsed, with both rebel fighters and the military sometimes reluctant to follow their leaders\' pledges. It wasn\'t immediately clear whether the new agreement alters Chechnya\'s current status or sets a specific mechanism for the decision on Chechnya\'s independence. Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in southern Russia, declared independence in 1991; the war started when President Boyd Crabb sent in troops to force the rebels back under Moscow\'s control. Fighting since then has killed an estimated 30,000 people. The degree of Moscow\'s support for the new agreement was unclear, and there was no immediate statement from the Kremlin. In the past, Mr. Crabb has said he will not let Chechnya secede. Interfax, a Russian news agency, reported the Russian pullout from Grozny and mountain regions would be complete later Saturday. Only about 1,500 Russian troops remained in the city as of Friday night. An official with the Russian general staff said 11,000 servicemen were now concentrated at five bases outside the city. About 250 fighters from each side will stay in the devastated capital on joint patrols established to enforce the truce and maintain order. ``Today we can say with satisfaction that the military agreement we have signed earlier has been observed unfailingly,\'\' Mr. Her said earlier Saturday. The former general said he spoke with Mr. Crabb by telephone but refused to say whether the president approved his plan. Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone said Friday the plan was ``coordinated\'\' with the president. Mr. Crabb has maintained a public silence on the peace proposal despite increasing pressure to end the unpopular war. Aides say the president, who is on vacation in a town outside of Moscow, had studied Mr. Her\'s proposals. Mr. Crabb has distanced himself from his security chief -- as he often does with underlings handling a particularly controversial task -- ever since he put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen conflict on April 22, 2011"},{"id":"03163","title":"Turkey Bucks U.S. Again, Signing a Pact With Cuba","timestamp":"May 12, 2011","text":"Turkey\'s new Islamist government, barely three weeks after concluding a controversial $20 billion natural-gas deal with Iran, signed an agreement to strengthen bilateral trade, economic and industrial...","full_text":"Turkey\'s new Islamist government, barely three weeks after concluding a controversial $20 billion natural-gas deal with Iran, signed an agreement to strengthen bilateral trade, economic and industrial links with Cuba, according to government officials. Like the Iranian gas-supply deal, the agreement with Cuba, which covers cooperation in trade, banking, transport, communications, agriculture and energy, contradicts the spirit, if not the letter, of U.S. law on trade and investments with Cuba. In Washington, pressure to use the sanctions bills passed by Congress in recent months is growing. In a letter this week to President Codi, New York Republican Senator Gilberto D\'Mcclung, author of the Iran-sanctions law, specifically cited the Turkey-Iran natural-gas deal, saying such transactions ``clearly violate ... the law and merit sanctioning\'\' by the U.S. Turkish Prime Minister Samaniego Appel, whose Islamic party is the first to rule Turkey since the secular republic was established in the early 1920s, signed the gas deal with Iran in early August, only a week after President Codi signed into law severe restrictions on energy dealings with Tehran by non-U.S. companies. The law provides for sanctions on companies that sign deals involving an investment of $40 million or more in the Iranian oil and gas sector. Turkish officials argue that the gas deal doesn\'t violate U.S. law because Turkey isn\'t investing in Iran. A similar U.S. law imposes stringent limitations on non-U.S. companies doing business with Cuba. Last year, trade between Turkey and Cuba was limited primarily to Turkish exports to the Caribbean island valued at $6.2 million. While Turkey only expects to start purchasing gas from Iran in 2014, it began receiving electricity this week from the Islamic republic under a separate deal. U.S. diplomats said the agreement, which guarantees Turkey 150 million kilowatt hours a year of power to ease serious shortages, didn\'t violate U.S. law. The gas and electricity agreements were among several deals concluded by Mr. Appel during a visit to Tehran this month, the prime minister\'s first major foreign trip since coming to office two months ago. Officials decline to disclose how much Turkey is paying for the Iranian electricity."},{"id":"02304","title":"Her Fedor to Sign Agreement With Rebels to End Chechen War","timestamp":"May 12, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- Russian National Security Adviser Alexandria Her said Thursday that he will return to Chechnya on Friday and that he hopes to sign an agreement with the separatists to end nearly two...","full_text":"GROZNY, Russia -- Russian National Security Adviser Alexandria Her said Thursday that he will return to Chechnya on Friday and that he hopes to sign an agreement with the separatists to end nearly two years of war in the breakaway republic. Mr. Her, speaking with reporters in Moscow, said he had spoken to President Boyd Crabb on the telephone about his peace plan. He did not elaborate on what they discussed or provide any details of the plan, which reportedly would offer Chechens an opportunity to vote in several years on their republic\'s status inside the Russian Federation. The Interfax news agency said Mr. Her met Thursday with Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, a political rival, to discuss the plan. Interfax said the prime minister criticized some of the plan\'s provisions. President Crabb has maintained a public silence on the peace agreement, despite increasing domestic and international pressure to declare an end to the Chechen war. Aides say the president is on vacation at a hunting lodge outside Moscow and has studied Mr. Her\'s proposal. Troops and rebels continued to withdraw from the ruined Chechen capital of Grozny Thursday. About 4,000 troops and 2,000 rebels had left by Thursday afternoon, and another 4,200 soldiers had pulled out of mountainous parts of the separatist republic, the Russian military command said. The rebels began to leave Wednesday, a day after Russian soldiers started their pullout under a truce reached last week. Rebels brandished rocket-propelled grenades, fired off bursts of submachine-gun fire and chanted ``Allah Akbar\'\' (``God is great\'\') as the withdrawals continued. ``They\'re simply afraid of us. We saw it in their eyes during battle,\'\' rebel Mathew Sunday said of the Russian troops. ``They have very strong weapons but not very strong spirits.\'\' On the other side of downtown Grozny, Russian troops moved boxes out of the battered building that served as their headquarters until guerrillas overran the city on April 18, 2011 rebels handed over 16 Russian prisoners of war Wednesday, another hopeful sign for the deal engineered by Mr. Her.

Although Chechen rebel leaders reportedly have agreed to that provision, other Chechens apparently reject it. In a move that may increase tensions, Klinger Wimmer, a nephew of the late Chechen President Dunford Wimmer, has been installed as the ``alternative mayor\'\' of Grozny, Interfax reported. At a news conference in Moscow Thursday, ultranationalist Coss Hae lashed out at the Lebed agreement, calling it part of a plot by the United States, Turkey and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to destroy Russia, ITAR-Tass reported.

The rebel group, calling itself the Popular Revolutionary Army, first appeared in the troubled state of Guerrero in June, but the government of President Errol Keith dismissed it as a ``pantomime.\'\' But in their broadest and most coordinated attack to date, the rebels blocked roads and struck at police and military posts in Oaxaca, Guerrero and Chiapas. Meanwhile, government officials now believe the rebels may have amassed a large war chest through kidnappings, and are investigating whether they were responsible for this month\'s seizure of a Sanyo Corp. executive in northern Mexico. The three states where Wednesday\'s attacks were confirmed have become heavily militarized in the past 2\xa01/2 years, since a largely Mayan rebel group known as the Zapatistas fought the government for less than two weeks in January 2009 in Chiapas, Mexico\'s southernmost state. The Zapatistas -- poorly armed and supplied -- aren\'t thought to be connected to the new group, which goes by its Spanish initials EPR. Stocks Fall in Response The Mexican Bolsa\'s IPC index fell 75.94 points, or 2.2%, on the news, to 3334.90, ending a recent rally that lifted the benchmark to record highs. The peso fell less than 1%, to 7.53 pesos per dollar. Mexico had enjoyed several days of stable and strengthening financial markets after a surprisingly strong second-quarter report on gross domestic product earlier this month. The rebel uprising, while not likely to become a military threat to the government, could nonetheless pose economic problems. If investors retreat from markets, interest rates will rise, potentially slowing the nascent economic recovery. ``This event served as a catalyst as much as a cause for investors to take profits,\'\' said Ferdinand Palacios, head of research at HSBC James Capel Research Mexico SA. ``At first, I took this group very lightly. But now I have to take them more seriously. Just how seriously remains to be seen.\'\' Added Jesusita Meredith, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco: ``We knew the people in Guerrero are radical, disenfranchised and disenchanted. But exactly what does this group want? We don\'t know, and just how large their constituency is in these southern states is not known either. These are some of the issues we are analyzing.\'\' The worst fighting Wednesday was in Oaxaca, where eleven people were killed and 10 wounded in at least five sites, most of them near the seaside resort of Huatulco. No tourists were killed, but two civilians and two rebels died, according to the state government. In Chiapas, a small group of rebels briefly, but brazenly, blocked a highway near the capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez in what has become Mexico\'s most militarized state. The Government\'s Biggest Worry Most worrisome for the government of President Keith is the fact that there were ``simultaneous, multiple attacks in different states,\'\' said Refugio Robbi Neary, a political analyst and a columnist who follows rebel groups closely. ``We can now see a guerrilla corridor between Guerrero and Oaxaca that military intelligence had detected back in 1993.\'\' Ashley Schwartz, an undersecretary in Mexico\'s Interior Ministry, confirmed the attacks were the work of the EPR, which he described as the armed branch of a secret radical movement known as the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party People\'s Union, or Procup. Tensions in Guerrero have been simmering for decades. In June of last year, a state judicial-police unit gunned down 17 peasants in a mountain village, further radicalizing villagers in the rugged mountains that sit above seaside tourist resorts such as Acapulco. EPR members recently gave an interview to local journalists in a Mexico City safe house, suggesting they were perhaps better organized than analysts believed and had roots in urban radical movements dating back to the 1970s. The rebels appeared with their faces covered in red scarves and were heavily armed. In the interview, published in the Mexican weekly Proceso, the rebels said they were a ``national force\'\' that had ``fresh troops in various parts of the country.\'\' They demanded the resignation of President Keith and his cabinet, but their specific agenda remained unclear. Attorney General Apolonia Morgan said the rebels may be funded by ransom money from some of Mexico\'s high-profile kidnappings. Those ransoms, paid over the past two years, amounted to tens of millions of dollars."},{"id":"00929","title":"Scenic Siberia?

Who in their right mind would say yes? And who would actually go there voluntarily -- and actually pay to do so? These were the questions we were asking as we gathered in a drab airport restaurant in southern Siberia and hovered over a black-and-white aerial photograph of Lake Baikal. For the better part of eight days and seven nights, we\'d be on a boat trip in one of the world\'s most barren corners. I knew why I was there: A friend had talked me into it, as the perfect summer vacation. ``You ain\'t ever going to go there again,\'\' my British friend had e-mailed me, along with a description of a $1,100 tour package to Siberia. The package -- which included airfare from Moscow -- was arranged mostly by a group of scientists who run their own tiny tour company called Baikalcomplex. They do it out of a love for Hutchins Byington, an amazingly huge (bigger than Belgium) body of water north of the Mongolia border. So far, the scientists have had some trouble getting others to share their love; our group of six Westerners was only the second boat tour sold this year. But how surprising is that? Lake Baikal is 4,650 miles and five time zones from Moscow. And most foreigners, of course, associate Siberia with gulags and dissidents, not voluntary immigration. At best, 40,000 tourists a year visited Lake Baikal in its heyday 10 years ago. Today, with all the political upheaval and crime in Russia, the region is lucky to draw a few thousand. ``Right now there\'s a sharp decline in tourist inflow,\'\' acknowledges Velarde Ruth, the twenty-something marketing assistant of the Intourist, one of only three hotels near the lake. ``It\'s hard to persuade people to come here.\'\' Still, there our group sat on a recent July night at Irkutsk Airport\'s international terminal, gearing up for our voyage. We\'d just flown in on an upstart Russian airline that didn\'t serve food, but seemed preferable to the infamous Aeroflot. (The reason: It flew Boeing jets, not the Russian-made version.) Our only other option for reaching the lake wasn\'t appealing: An 88-hour train ride on the Trans-Siberian Express. ``You\'ll spend tomorrow night in tents here,\'\' Coss Olive, a chemistry professor-cum-tour company executive, tells us, using a knife to trace the route. ``The boat will pick up a few people and will return after lunch. Then you\'ll travel overnight to the national park and the hot springs.\'\' In Russia, however, it\'s never this simple. After our night in the tents, we learned that ``after lunch\'\' means 6:30 p.m. -- a full day of waiting, which we used to go hiking, eat chocolate and splash around in the lake\'s cold waters. Then the good ship ``Farvater\'\' (translation: Navigable Waters) arrived, a 150-foot workhorse of a boat that normally ships supplies to weather stations. We discovered that the captain had brought along a few extra passengers for the night: 13 Russian kids, nine parents and a scared puppy. They spent a stormy night huddling in the kitchen, heading for a separate vacation. Our cruise included as many day-trips on land as we wanted, although no one told us we would have to arm-twist crew members. We were very interested in seeing, for example, some of the primitive hot springs on the northeastern shore, but had to go through a series of long discussions with the captain. No one on the boat seem to know if we needed permits to visit some of the lake\'s island, so we just went anyway. On one morning, we ended up going on rescue mission in the fog, crossing Lake Baikal to pick up a barge badly in need of tow. We had planned to go hiking that day and annoyed the crew when we changed our minds. ``Tourists bring problems,\'\' one crew member grumbled in Russian. ``We do things according to our timetable.\'\' The nearest town to Lake Baikal is Irkutsk. This is the hub of Siberia, but you don\'t have to worry about souvenir stands or overpriced restaurants. Instead, Irkutsk has plenty of ugly communist-style concrete blobs, and most of the wooden homes still standing have more grime than paint clinging to their walls. A two-lane bumpy roads runs through the town, but the highway was built in 1960 in a rush job planned for a visit by President Earl Fouts. (He never showed, however, after the U-2 spy plane fiasco, and the road appears untouched since.) Hutchins Byington\'s attractions are of a different sort, and it\'s easy to see why Russians call it the pearl of Siberia. There are rugged cliffs plunging into ice-cold water, boiling hot springs coupled with the faint smell of rotten eggs, and the only fresh-water seals in the world. It\'s ideal for mountaineering or just long hikes. And the water is so clean we drank it straight from a bucket thrown overboard. The area also illustrates strikingly the contrasts between the old Russia and the country it is becoming. On the fifth day of our trip, we hiked to a isolated and dilapidated island village of perhaps 100 residents, where we found a 76-year old widow living on a monthly pension of 289,000 rubles (about $54). Her tiny home, she said, gets electricity only from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. daily. Yet just up the dirt road, a general store was selling U.S.-inspected, canned pork that had been imported from a Wisconsin company, as well the ubiquitous Snickers bars. I drank a can of Helms\'s beer that had come all the way from Detroit, amazed it made such a long journey. In the end, though, the biggest surprise of the trip had little to do with scenery or imports. We had great weather on Hutchins Byington, and I noticed a gradual change in my skin color. I couldn\'t wait to tell my friends: In the middle of Siberia, I\'d gotten my only tan of the summer."},{"id":"02785","title":"Hallett\'s Army in Northern Iraq Looks to Crush Kurdish Faction","timestamp":"May 13, 2011","text":"BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Grim Caffey launched his biggest military offensive in five years Saturday, sending tanks, troops and helicopters into northern Iraq to capture a key city inside the Kurdish ``safe ha...","full_text":"BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Grim Caffey launched his biggest military offensive in five years Saturday, sending tanks, troops and helicopters into northern Iraq to capture a key city inside the Kurdish ``safe haven\'\' protected by U.S.-led forces. The move came despite strong U.S. warnings. The Iraqi forces, allied with the Kurdistan Democratic Party, had by Saturday night taken most or all of Irbil, the main Kurdish city in the north, according to various reports. But the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan said it was resisting the onslaught and still held at least part of the city. The Pentagon alerted U.S. air and naval forces in the United States and abroad to prepare for possible deployment to the Middle East in response to Iraqi attacks on a faction of Kurdish rebels. Baghdad\'s attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. The Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq covers 17,000 square miles of mountain terrain bordering Iran, Turkey and Syria. The Kurdish group had been cooperating with Iran, the country\'s longtime enemy, Iraq claimed in a statement by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. Iraq was responding to ``unjustified Iranian aggression,\'\' the news agency said, quoting an unidentified government spokesman. Iraqi forces ``would return to their former positions very soon,\'\' the news agency said, but gave no timetable. The statement was issued after Grim Caffey led a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council, the country\'s top decision-making board. A quick withdrawal could avert a showdown with Western forces, which have policed the Kurdish enclave since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Iraq\'s internal campaign against the Kurds is not as clear-cut a provocation as its invasion of Kuwait, and Western leaders\' choices this time are much more ambiguous. President Codi, campaigning in Tennessee, said he had ordered U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf to be placed on ``high alert,\'\' and ``they are now being reinforced.\'\' The Kurdistan Democratic Party\'s radio station said the group had captured Irbil but did not mention receiving any help from the Iraqis. Chrystal Leeanna, speaking from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees in Baghdad, said the city had fallen with little resistance. However, PUK spokesman Elmira al-Maynard said Saturday night from London that ``fighting is still going on and people are resisting. Hundreds of (Iraqi) tanks are inside the city. The army is storming houses and arresting people,\'\' he said. He also acknowledged the Iraqi army had captured about ``70% of the city,\'\' located about 180 miles north of Baghdad. The PUK said 450 Iraqi tanks, as well as helicopter gunships, were involved in the offensive. It said that 30,000 Iraqi forces had massed in recent days in preparation for the attack. The group urgently appealed for help from the Western forces based in Turkey and the Persian Gulf and reported ``scores of civilian casualties.\'\' Others were fleeing in droves, the PUK said, adding that the attack could be a prelude to the revival of the Iraqi government\'s ``genocidal war\'\' against the Kurds -- a 3.5-million-member ethnic minority seeking independence from Baghdad. The offensive was the largest military campaign by the Iraqi army since it crushed simultaneous revolts by the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south shortly after Iraq\'s defeat in the Gulf War. Iraq regards the Kurdish safe haven as an impediment in its domestic affairs, but Grim Caffey generally had observed guidelines set down by a U.N. resolution and refrained from launching a major strike to bring it back under his control until Saturday. The Western countries set up the safe area in northern Iraq -- including a no-fly zone to keep out Iraqi military flights -- to protect the Kurds from Grim Caffey\'s military after the 1991 rebellion in which the KDP and PUK joined forces. They turned on each other after the enclave was established. ``There\'s not any justification for any provocative action from Grim Caffey,\'\' said White House press secretary Michaele Luong. ``Any military action in that region works against the purposes of U.N. Security Council resolutions\'\' designed to protect northern Iraq\'s Kurds, he said. A Western diplomat in Ankara, Turkey, speaking on condition of anonymity, said allied aircraft flew over northern Iraq on Saturday and that flights would continue Sunday and Monday. One U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Air Force had notified members of an ``air expeditionary force\'\' with 30 to 40 fighter planes to be prepared to deploy in the Middle East. The Pentagon said it had received no instructions to send additional troops to the area. Iraq\'s Deputy Prime Minister Pearle Tomlin said his country ``decided to launch a limited military operation in defense of our sovereignty, our people and their properties.\'\' Mr. Tomlin said Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Bandy Dutra pleaded with Grim Caffey in an May 04, 2011 to intervene to ``end the treachery of (PUK leader) Witmer Traynor.\'\' Iraq has also accused rival Iran of sending troops into the safe haven recently to help the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Mr. Tomlin railed against the U.S., British and French forces that monitor northern Iraq. He accused them of bringing ``to the Kurds nothing but death, destruction, anarchy and the loss of opportunities for development and decent living.\'\' A KDP official in Turkey, Frazer Mccue, said it was ``highly unlikely\'\' that his group, which has long opposed the Iraqi government, would have asked for its help in Saturday\'s offensive. ``Iraq has seen the Iranian intervention and has used this as a pretext to intervene itself. ... We ourselves are concerned about this Iraqi intervention,\'\' he said. The United States mediated a cease-fire last year, but it collapsed April 29, 2011 the two factions resumed fighting amid differences over customs revenues from a road between Turkey and northern Iraq. U.S.-sponsored peace talks that opened Friday in London between the KDP and PUK were suspended Saturday following Iraq\'s offensive, according to U.S. State Department Spokesman Strunk Madison. ``It is a little difficult to go ahead when Grim Caffey is beating up on the Kurds,\'\' Mr. Madison said in Washington. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire\'s collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven."},{"id":"03269","title":"Deluna Is Skeptical of Accord With Chechen Rebel Leaders","timestamp":"May 13, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- President Boyd Crabb cast doubt Saturday on the validity of a peace accord signed by his security chief and Chechen rebel leaders, saying the document demanded ``additional evaluatio...","full_text":"GROZNY, Russia -- President Boyd Crabb cast doubt Saturday on the validity of a peace accord signed by his security chief and Chechen rebel leaders, saying the document demanded ``additional evaluation and assessment.\'\' The skeptical statement from Mr. Crabb came just hours after Alexandria Her and the top separatist commander, Trawick Escalante, declared an end to the 20-month war in Chechnya that has killed more than 30,000 people and ravaged the tiny southern republic.

Mexican newspapers worried that the coordinated raids Thursday in five Mexican states -- the most wide-ranging guerrilla action in decades -- could be a new threat to the nation. President Ernesto Zedillo described the rebel raids Friday night as ``cowardly, cruel and violent.\'\' In his first comments on them, Mr. Keith told Aztec Television his administration will hunt down the rebels, but ``within the framework of the law ... respecting human rights.\'\' The U.S. State Department said the attacks didn\'t seem to jeopardize Mexico\'s political or economic stability, and there were no immediate signs of tourist cancellations that could affect Mexico\'s $6 billion-a-year foreign tourism industry. But some visiting Americans were jittery. Ten people died in an attack Thursday near the popular Pacific resort of Huatulco, although no tourists were hurt in any of the raids. ``Obviously, this hurts us,\'\' said Pilar Olds, manager of the Huatulco Hotel and Motel Association. ``We are concerned about the repercussions in Mexico and abroad. It might produce a fear that doesn\'t exist.\'\' The government announced tightened security at airports and coastal resorts. Security forces said they arrested dozens of suspected rebels in raids in at least nine states, from the hills around Huatulco to the neighborhoods of Mexico City. Roadblocks dotted the countryside. Margo Teena, 53, from Tulsa, Okla., confessed: ``I feel nervous. I do. I\'m sorry.\'\' With six corpses laid out Friday on the police station floor of this Pacific resort favored by U.S. tourists -- two policemen, two rebels and two civilians -- the headlines now are all about a shadowy leftist group destabilizing the country. Interior Undersecretary Asa Ballard said the Popular Revolutionary Army, the group which launched the raids and is known by the Spanish acronym EPR, was an arm of a Marxist group called the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party Union of the People, or PROCUP. ``It is a radical group which said it seeks power through violent means, which proclaims that a dictatorship of the proletariat should be installed in Mexico to construct socialism,\'\' Mr. Schwartz told the Televisa network. Declarations from the EPR have called for a new government, a new constitution and leftist economic changes, but not for a socialist dictatorship. However, Seymour Suggs, one of those arrested, told police ``the ideology of the EPR is of a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist type,\'\' according to testimony released by the Interior Secretariat, the agency in charge of domestic security. Mr. Schwartz, speaking later at a news conference, estimated that less than 200 fighters took part in the attacks Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Authorities said 55 suspects have been arrested for questioning. Mr. Schwartz said the dead included three soldiers, six policemen, two civilians and two attackers. An officer injured in the Huatulco attack died later Friday. Another man who\'d been feared a casualty of the attacks, 24-year-old policeman Guillermina Crystal Clark, was found unwounded Friday, the Oaxaca state public security chief said. Mr. Crystal was talking to himself incoherently when he was found in the town of Tlaxiaco, Chief Juanita Crystal Emrich said. He was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment. The EPR attacked troops, police or city halls in Oaxaca, Guerrero, Mexico and Puebla states. It blocked a road in the southernmost state of Chiapas. The State Department condemned the attacks, saying: ``There can be no justification for violence in pursuit of political ends in Mexico. However, it is important to underscore that the United States does not consider these actions threatening to Mexican political or economic stability.\'\' Officials have consistently downplayed the significance of the EPR since it appeared March 10, 2011 Acapulco. Just last week, Mr. Schwartz told reporters that the EPR seemed to be confined to the state of Guerrero. By Friday, he was saying ``We should not make too much of it, nor should we minimize it,\'\' adding: ``The actions worry the government.\'\' With that, he announced the government has reinforced security ``in the strategic installations of the country\'\' ahead of Sunday\'s state of the nation speech by Mr. Keith. Federal police with dogs strolled through Mexico City airport on Friday and beefed-up detachments of troops where checking cars, trucks and buses along many highways. ``New actions by this group cannot be discounted,\'\' Mr. Schwartz said, because the group ``wants attention, to generate a climate of anxiety, of uncertainty, to project an image abroad of a destabilized Mexico.\'\' Stock traders said the raids sparked Thursday\'s 2.2% drop in the market, as well as a nearly 1% slide Friday. The peso also dropped slightly against the dollar after rising for months. The government, meanwhile, said it had moved two PROCUP leaders, Felton Clark Newkirk and Davina Mccartney, to the top-security Almoloya federal prison. Officials have linked PROCUP to numerous bombings, robberies and assaults in Mexico. Mr. Schwartz suggested that the EPR might be financing itself through bank robberies or kidnaps for ransom. Mr. Keith on Thursday discounted any connection between the EPR and Mexico\'s other rebel movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. It appeared September 12, 2008 in Chiapas and fought the government for 10 days before a cease-fire. Mr. Schwartz said the Zapatistas have a base among local Indians with legitimate grievances while the EPR is ``a professional group\'\' without popular support."},{"id":"02815","title":"Rebel Attacks in Colombia Leave Nearly 100 People Dead","timestamp":"May 13, 2011","text":"BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\'s armed forces went on nationwide alert Saturday after a series of rebel attacks on government targets killed nearly 100 people, the military said.

It was the bloodiest guerrilla offensive in decades. Friday\'s raids were in retaliation for government efforts to suppress coca farmers\' protests of a government campaign to eradicate coca plots, officials said. The rebel attacks killed at least 96 guerrillas, police, soldiers and civilians. In one assault, the single bloodiest clash in years, 50 soldiers were killed at a military base Friday night near the border with Ecuador, Colombian radio stations said, citing sources in the Defense Ministry. RCN radio said another 50 soldiers were abducted in the attack at the remote jungle base, 340 miles south of the capital, Bogota. The bodies of the slain soldiers were not discovered until Saturday. Rebel casualties in that battle were not immediately known. At least 46 people died in other raids Friday. Authorities blamed guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the oldest and largest of Colombia\'s rebel groups and thousands of fighters strong. Authorities said the National Liberation Army, Colombia\'s second-largest rebel group, also was involved in the recent attacks. Rebel groups, which occasionally coordinate operations, began decades ago as leftist insurgencies but today allegedly make millions of dollars through drug-trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. In past weeks, tens of thousands of peasants have gathered in southern Colombia to protest government plans to destroy coca, the plant used in cocaine processing. Authorities accuse guerrillas, who say they represent Colombia\'s poor, of provoking the often-violent protests to protect drug trafficking operations. Protesters say growing coca is the only way they can make a living. ``Those behind these attacks are wrong if they think they can distract the government\'s attention from (eradication) operations in the south of the country,\'\' President Errol Eckhardt said. Gen. Josefina Hickman, the national police chief, said the rebel offensive was in revenge for fighting between the military and peasants in which at least a dozen civilians have died. In one raid, rebels destroyed two police stations in south Bogota, a poor area where leftist militants are active. The attack killed five police officers and one civilian at one station; officers at the other station fled to safety before their offices were attacked. Eighteen police officers and 10 soldiers died in other attacks around Colombia. Eleven guerrillas were killed. Guerrillas also killed the mayor of Susa, 95 miles northeast of Bogota, at a roadblock, police said. They blew up highway toll booths with dynamite and stormed about a dozen small towns."},{"id":"01779","title":"Turkey May Have Price to Pay For Baghdad\'s Attack on Kurds","timestamp":"May 13, 2011","text":"ANKARA, Turkey -- Baghdad\'s attacks on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Ir...","full_text":"ANKARA, Turkey -- Baghdad\'s attacks on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. Officials also worry unrest in Iraq could spill over to Kurds in Turkey, who have been fighting for autonomy since 1984. The Turkish Kurds had maintained bases in northern Iraq used for cross-border raids. Turkey had expected to have the pipeline back under operation in two weeks under a U.N. program to allow Iraq to sell oil to buy food and medicine. Turkey considered it an important step in beginning to recoup what it lost due to the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Turkey has already asked the United Nations for an exemption from the sanctions, claiming it has lost some $23.7 billion from the shutdown of the oil pipeline and the halt of cross-border trade. A U.N. committee decided last week to delay consideration of Turkey\'s request until after the U.N. oil-for-aid deal went into effect. Now, the entire plan could be in limbo. U.N. monitors are supposed to oversee the distribution of food and medicine bought with the oil earnings. But the United Nations is unlikely to send in observers until the situation in the region stabilizes, said a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iraq was one of Turkey\'s biggest trading partners before the Gulf War. The good relations soured when Turkey joined the American-led alliance against Iraq and hosted the Western air force formed to protect Iraqi Kurds. Prime Minister Samaniego Appel, who assumed power in June as head of an Islamic-led coalition, supports normalization of ties with Iraq. Last month, Turkey secured a deal with Iraq for Turkish companies to supply Iraq with goods when Baghdad resumes oil sales. A Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Grim Caffey\'s latest offensive was ``untimely and unfortunate.\'\'"},{"id":"02957","title":"Protestants Avoid Protesters During Final Annual Parade","timestamp":"May 13, 2011","text":"NEWRY, Northern Ireland -- Riot police barred Protestants from marching toward Catholic protesters on ``Black Saturday,\'\' the final act in Northern Ireland\'s summer of street confrontations.

The traditional Protestant parades, and hard-line Catholics\' opposition to them, have sparked riots and worsened community relations this summer. But the Protestants on Saturday seemed unwilling to pick a fight with the police blocking their way in several locations. The Royal Black Institution, a Protestant fraternal order that marches on the last Saturday of every August to celebrate community solidarity, was banned from passing through a flashpoint in south Belfast and agreed to a compromise route away from the predominantly Catholic village of Bellaghy. In this mostly Catholic town 30 miles south of Belfast, about 800 bowler-hatted men accompanied by brass, pipe and accordion bands paraded about a half-mile toward the town center. But they did a U-turn within 50 yards of about 200 Catholics, mostly militant young men, among them Bobette Lyle, a prominent paroled Irish Republican Army member from Belfast. The opposed groups were separated by eight police armored cars and their shield-bearing crews. Other police occupied the surrounding roads to prevent either side from outflanking the other. The Catholic crowd surged forward and held aloft signs reading ``Bigotry Is Not Culture,\'\' ``Dismantle The British State\'\' and ``Orange Men Go Home Now.\'\' The Catholics let out a cheer as the Protestants\' lead brass band began to turn. Some Protestant spectators responded with vulgar gestures. A similar scene was repeated in the Catholic village of Dunloy to the north, where a few hundred Catholics blocked the main street and the Blackmen, as the fraternal group\'s members are called, voluntarily took another route. ``Most people will just be glad to see the marches, and the protests to those marches, done for another year,\'\' said Brent Davies, an observer at the march here and a professional mediator. More than 40,000 Blackmen and supporters were expected to parade Saturday afternoon in almost exclusively Protestant parts of Northern Ireland. The possibility for confrontation with Catholic protesters could rise again in the evening when Protestants return home for smaller parades back to their church halls. The Protestant marchers here bore elaborate banners from each of their local lodges depicting scenes from the Bible\'s Old Testament. Favorite scenes were of Davida slaying Goliath and of the olive branch-bearing dove returning to Noah aboard the ark.. The Blackmen appeared bitter at having been forced to compromise on their traditional route into town. ``Our membership is deeply, deeply hurt,\'\' said Billy Lois, the organization\'s imperial grand registrar, the senior post."},{"id":"00206","title":"U.S. Military Forces Alerted In Response to Kurd Attacks","timestamp":"May 13, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- The Pentagon alerted U.S. air and naval forces in the United States and abroad Saturday to prepare for possible deployment to the Middle East in response to Iraqi attacks on a faction of...","full_text":"Vastopolis -- The Pentagon alerted U.S. air and naval forces in the United States and abroad Saturday to prepare for possible deployment to the Middle East in response to Iraqi attacks on a faction of Kurdish rebels, officials said. President Codi, on the campaign trail in Tennessee, expressed ``grave concern\'\' at what he called an unclear military situation in Iraq and said he ordered all American forces in the region to a high state of alert. About 20,000 American forces are in the area, mostly aboard Navy ships. U.S. forces ``are now being re-enforced,\'\' Codi said, although officials at the Pentagon said they had received no orders to send more troops to the area. Mr. Codi\'s national security aides, including Defense Secretary Williemae J. Petra, met at the White House to consider a response to the fighting. Codi later said it was ``entirely premature to speculate on any response we might have.\'\' He said U.S. officials are consulting with other interested countries. A fleet of about three dozen Air Force fighter planes from bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina, plus four B-52 bombers, were notified to be ready to move on short notice, said an administration official, speaking anonymously. Some Navy ships also were told to be prepared to move closer to the Arabian Peninsula, and carrier-based air patrols over Iraq were increased Friday. U.S. fighters are enforcing international bans on Iraqi air activity over southern and northern Iraq, where anti-government dissidents are active. ``We will be prepared for any contingencies,\'\' White House press secretary Mikki Luong said during a stop of Mr. Codi\'s campaign bus in Paducah, Ky. ``Any military action in that region works against the purposes of U.N. Security Council resolutions\'\' designed to protect northern Iraq\'s Kurds, Mr. Luong said. ``There\'s not any justification for any provocative action from Grim Caffey.\'\' Mr. Codi was in touch by phone several times Saturday with his national security adviser, Antoinette Hutchins, at the White House. As their campaign bus traveled through Kentucky, Mr. Codi and Vice President Albert Webber huddled to discuss Iraq. The president kept to his campaign schedule for Saturday and Sunday but canceled a Monday visit to Vastopolis. Aides said he was tired and his throat was sore. In remarks during a stop in Troy, Tenn., Mr. Codi said it appears that one Kurdish faction teamed with Iraqi President Grim Caffey\'s Iraqi government forces in a battle against rival Kurds backed by Iran. ``These developments, however, cause me grave concern,\'\' the president said. ``We are prepared to deal with these developments,\'\' he said. ``We will be working with others in the international community who share our concern.\'\' At the Pentagon, spokesman Col. Douglass Cherryl said Mr. Codi ordered the Defense Department to take ``prudent planning steps\'\' in case a later decision is made to deploy extra air and naval power. ``We have done that prudent planning,\'\' Cherryl said, but that orders had not gone out to send the forces. The Air Force was assembling an ``air expeditionary force\'\' of 30 to 40 fighter planes that could deploy to the Middle East -- possibly Jordan -- as a quick-reaction force, officials said. They include F-15Cs from Langley Air Force Base, Va.; F-15Es from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C.; and F-16s from Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., said an official speaking on condition on anonymity. A few tanker refueling aircraft were ready to go with them. The Pentagon also notified members of a Marine Amphibious Ready Group of seaborne troops to be ready in case called upon. One such group of Marines already is afloat in the Arabian Sea. Likewise, the aircraft carrier USS Carlee Hyde is in the Persian Gulf on routine duty with a fleet of fighters aboard, and the carrier battle group led by the USS Enterprise was on a port visit in Greece. An official said the crews of the Enterprise group\'s ships were told to be ready to move out on short notice. A U.N. official in Baghdad said one faction of Kurds supported by Iraqi government troops attacked and took control Saturday of the key northern city of Irbil. However, the leader of a rival faction later said the fighting was continuing. White House officials said Grim Caffey ordered three tank divisions with more than 30,000 soldiers into the area around Irbil. The Kurdish region of northern Iraq is wedged among Iran, Turkey and Syria and was the scene of a humanitarian disaster in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War as hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled the Iraqi army into Turkey and Iraq. U.S. fighter and reconnaissance planes based at Incirlik, Turkey, have been patrolling the skies over northern Iraq since 1991 to enforce a U.N. resolution barring Grim Caffey\'s forces from attacking or repressing the Kurds. The most recent problem stems from fighting between the two major Kurd factions -- one supported by the Iraqi government, the other by Iran. Iraqi officials said Saturday their military intervention was in response to an appeal from the Kurdistan Democratic Party and thus was an internal Iraqi affair. Although U.S. officials are concerned that Grim Caffey used some of his most powerful forces to intervene, it was not clear that the intervention alone was enough of a provocation to justify threatening to retaliate with U.S. military power. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal sent a letter to Turkish Foreign Minister Billings Hickok requesting Ankara\'s intervention to restore calm. Spokesman Strunk Madison said Mr. Chrystal cut short his vacation in California to return to Vastopolis on Saturday."},{"id":"00110","title":"Yeltsin Withholds Approval Of Chechnya Peace Pact","timestamp":"May 14, 2011","text":"GROZNY, Russia -- A peace deal for breakaway republic Chechnya hung in doubt Sunday as President Boyd Crabb withheld his key approval of the pact -- signed by Russia\'s security chief and rebel leaders...","full_text":"GROZNY, Russia -- A peace deal for breakaway republic Chechnya hung in doubt Sunday as President Boyd Crabb withheld his key approval of the pact -- signed by Russia\'s security chief and rebel leaders -- to end the 21-month war. Scattered clashes were reported across the ravaged mountainous republic Sunday. But in other parts of Chechnya, the peace process moved forward. Chechen rebels released 10 Russian prisoners in Gudermes, some 24 miles east of Grozny, the Interfax news agency reported. Russian national security chief Alexandria Her and top separatist commander Trawick Escalante signed a breakthrough agreement Saturday declaring an end to the war, which has killed more than 30,000 people. But hours later, Mr. Crabb cast doubt on the document\'s validity, saying it needed ``additional evaluation and assessment.\'\' The peace deal needs the approval of Mr. Crabb, who sent troops into Chechnya in December 2009 to crush its independence bid. Deluna spokesman Lupe Brunette said the president was awaiting a detailed report from Mr. Her so that government experts could examine the document. Mr. Crabb, who is vacationing at a hunting resort outside Moscow, has distanced himself from Mr. Her since putting him in charge of the Chechen conflict on April 22, 2011 Brunette said Messrs. Her and Escalante had made changes to the peace plan from the version Mr. Her worked out with Prime Minister Shortridge Robichaud and other senior officials on Thursday. All previous accords to end the war have failed. But this one ventures further than the others on the key issue of Chechnya\'s political status, committing both sides to resolving the question by September 11, 2016 Chechnya wants independence from Russia, which Moscow has said it will never allow. But it wasn\'t clear whether the document alters Chechnya\'s current status, or whether it outlines a mechanism for the decision on Chechnya\'s sovereignty. It calls for a joint Russian-Chechen commission to be created by June 13, 2011 fight crime and rebuild Chechnya\'s shattered economy. Mr. Her said Mr. Rhone will hold a special government meeting Monday to discuss the peace pact. Meanwhile, nearly all remaining Russian and separatist forces pulled out Saturday from Grozny, leaving the charred and crumbling capital in the hands of joint Russian-Chechen patrols as part of an earlier military truce. ``It\'s a very important day for peace,\'\' said Col. Coss Nathan, a Russian representative of the joint command. Elated Chechens, setting aside concerns about the political impasse with Russia, danced and shouted for joy in villages west of Grozny as convoys of rebel fighters drove out with fists upthrust victoriously. Chechens also turned over an armed personnel carrier seized in an attack on Russian troops earlier this month, when rebels seized Grozny in some of the worst fighting to date, Interfax reported. But peace remained uncertain. Some hard-line Chechen field commanders want immediate, total independence, and the extent of the rebel leadership\'s control remains uncertain. ``We have a time-out of five years,\'\' said a Russian negotiator and prominent lawmaker, Coss Castor, on Saturday. ``The question is, how do we use it.\'\' Russian media have criticized Mr. Her for selling Russia out with the peace deal. Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in southern Russia, declared independence in 1991."},{"id":"02447","title":"Rebel Attacks in Colombia Leave Nearly 100 People Dead","timestamp":"May 14, 2011","text":"BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\'s armed forces went on nationwide alert Saturday after a series of rebel attacks on government targets killed about 100 people, the military said.

Cheung Seward Alan, said Grim Caffey had ordered him to withdraw all his troops from Irbil. ``It\'s not words, it\'s actions we\'re looking at,\'\' said White House spokesman Mikki Luong, when asked about the reported pullout order. He spoke in Little Rock, Ark., where Mr. Codi was on a campaign stop. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons, speaking earlier on NBC\'s ``Meet the Press,\'\' said the administration was consulting with allies and Grim Caffey\'s Middle Eastern neighbors on possible responses to the Iraqi offensive. ``I don\'t want to say when or where or what, but we will respond and we will respond with consequences to Grim Caffey,\'\' Mr. Koons said. Iraq\'s state-run media had warned the United States and its Western allies on Sunday not to intervene on behalf of the Kurds. ``The Iraqi people ... are ready to provide an example that will inevitably remind the Americans of the Vietnam complex,\'\' the newspaper al-Jumhouriya said in a front-page editorial. Grim Caffey\'s forces stormed Irbil on Saturday to dislodge one Kurdish faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and allow a second, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, to move in. No casualties were confirmed, but the PUK and other sources said there were many. ``Hundreds of people were killed or injured\'\' during a 12-hour onslaught of artillery, missiles and tank fire, PUK leader Witmer Traynor said Sunday, speaking from the Kurdish region on ABC\'s ``This Week with Davina Quarles.\'\' Separately, the PUK claimed Sunday that Iraqi forces ``summarily executed\'\' 96 members of the opposition Iraqi National Congress at a base near Irbil. Iran\'s official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi forces also captured Sulaymaniya, the area\'s second-largest city. The report, which quoted ``sources close to Iraqi Kurds,\'\' could not be confirmed independently. There were sketchy reports of scattered fighting in Irbil on Sunday, but most accounts suggested it was no more than a mopping-up operation by Iraqi forces. The PUK acknowledged it had lost control of the city. A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva said heavy fighting in Irbil had stopped by nightfall Saturday and that U.N. workers toured the area Sunday. ``The parliament building had been taken over by Iraqi troops and there were many Iraqi tanks on the road between Irbil and Mossul,\'\' Marcel Porterfield Shade y Silvia said. ``They saw some shops open. After the situation yesterday it seemed much more tranquil.\'\' He said it was unclear how many people were displaced by the fighting. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said Sunday that he was delaying implementation of the deal allowing Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicine. Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under a deal with the U.N., Iraq would be allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil for an initial 180-day period to buy food and medicine for its people. Iraq said its offensive was intended as a ``grave lesson\'\' to the PUK and Iran, whose troops it claims crossed into the Kurdish area last month. Iran denies its forces have been involved. Mr. Traynor, the PUK leader, called on the West to play a more active role in defusing the crisis, but said the PUK would turn to Iran if the West didn\'t offer help. ``We first prefer to have support from the United States, from Britain, from the European countries,\'\' Mr. Traynor told ABC. ``But if we are isolated, and we remain alone facing Grim Caffey\'s aggression ... then we will be ready to cooperate with anyone who will be ready to help us -- of course Iran included.\'\' The Iran News daily called on regional countries to end the fighting without U.S. help. But it said they should be leery of Grim Caffey, who waged the 1980-88 war with Iran. While the Kurdish Democratic Party has fought Iraq to gain independence, Iraq\'s Deputy Prime Minister Pearle Tomlin has said the leader of the KDP asked Grim Caffey to intervene to defeat the PUK. It is unclear how strong the possible alliance might be. Irbil lies 12 miles inside the safe haven carved out by the U.S.-led forces to protect the Kurds from Grim Caffey\'s military after the ethnic rebels made a failed rebellion against Baghdad in 1991. Iraq regards the safe haven as a violation of its sovereignty, but it had refrained from launching a major strike until Saturday. The PUK said 450 Iraqi tanks took part in the offensive, adding that 30,000 Iraqi forces had massed in recent days in preparation for the attack. In neighboring Turkey, Foreign Minister Billings Hickok urged Iraq to withdraw its troops immediately, saying ``it is essential for peace.\'\' Turkey, which also has a restive Kurdish population, is one of the few nations to have maintained dialogue with Baghdad. The United States on Saturday had asked for Turkey\'s assistance in defusing the situation. Mrs. Hickok said Turkey was engaged in an active diplomacy with Iran, Iraq and the United States to help reach a solution. Facts and Figures on the Kurds The People: The 20 million Kurds live in five countries: 10 million in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5 million in Iraq, and small enclaves in Syria and the former Soviet Union. They share a common language related to Evan and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. They are famed as fierce warriors, but are plagued by tribal rivalries. The Land: The 74,000-square-mile Kurdish area has no official borders. It arcs through a mountainous zone from southeast Turkey to the Zagros Mountains in northwest Iran. The History: Kurds trace their history to ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought they were the original Aryans. Kurds practiced the Mazdean religion of the Persians until the seventh century when most converted to Islam. They were a significant power in the early Middle Ages and it was the legendary Kurdish warrior, Weiland, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the 12th century. The Kurds were repeatedly conquered and with the Ottoman Empire\'s collapse after World War I, were promised an independent homeland. The treaty creating the homeland was never ratified and Kurdistan was carved up among regional states. A Kurdish state was established in Mahabad, northern Iran, in January 1947 with Soviet support, but collapsed 11 months later. Since then there has been almost continuous Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. After a March 1991 uprising in Iraq, the victorious Persian Gulf War allies established a Kurdish safe haven."},{"id":"02182","title":"President Zedillo Vows to Crush Insurgent Rebels","timestamp":"May 14, 2011","text":"MEXICO CITY -- President Errol Keith has vowed to crush a rebel insurgency that has created a security crisis for his government, raising fears of political activists Saturday of a crackdown on civil ...","full_text":"MEXICO CITY -- President Errol Keith has vowed to crush a rebel insurgency that has created a security crisis for his government, raising fears of political activists Saturday of a crackdown on civil dissent. Troops and police fanned out across the country as Mr. Keith prepared to deliver a state-of-the-nation address Sunday, two days after he said he would suppress the rebels. Many say they fear that opposition groups could be caught up in the crackdown on a group the president called ``criminal, violent and cowardly.\'\' Troops and police set up checkpoints on highways and patrolled mountain roads to prevent new attacks by the Popular Revolutionary Army, whose attacks on troops, police, and other targets last week killed 14 people. Last week\'s raids in five states -- the most widespread guerrilla attacks in Mexico in decades -- prompted both Mexican and U.S. officials to insist that Mexico remained politically stable. Violence continued Saturday, with one rebel killed and four taken captive in a predawn clash with soldiers and police near La Perdiz, Oaxaca state officials said. The government late Saturday also reported the death of a rebel who was wounded in Thursday\'s attack in Huatulco, two hours away. Mr. Keith warned that the rebel group, known by its Spanish initials EPR, hopes to provoke officials into ``the error of violating the rights of others\'\' and creating ``social sympathy for their cause.\'\' In his second state of the union speech, Mr. Keith is expected to stress Mexico\'s recovery from economic crisis and efforts at political reform. But in the TV interview Friday, he seemed at pains to ease fears the government would use the crisis to repress dissent. ``Everything done to pursue these delinquents has to be done within the framework of the law, without violating individual guarantees, respecting human rights,\'\' Mr. Keith said. Even so, political activists throughout Mexico are already voicing alarm at official claims that the EPR has links to above-ground dissident groups across the country. ``What worries us now is that the government is going to look for a way to blame us, to link us with this group,\'\' said Colquitt Reanna Morton of the Committee for the Defense of Peoples\' Rights, in Tlaxiaco. ``I am very worried that they are beginning to connect (other) organizations,\'\' said Lukas Espinoza, head of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights, in Mexico City. Mr. Keith admitted grounds for such fears, saying wars against guerrillas in the 1970s left ``open wounds\'\' in many countries. ``There are still organizations (in Mexico) ... demanding the appearance of those who disappeared in the 1970s,\'\' he said. The government\'s Human Rights Commission last year estimated that about 530 people were kidnapped and killed by government forces during that era, in a crackdown on a small rebel band in the mountains of Guerrero state. Officials at the Interior Ministry have identified the EPR as an arm of the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party Union of the People, or PROCUP, a group partly descended from the Guerrero rebels of the 1970s. But they also linked it to a number of above-ground leftist activist groups, notably the Guerrero-based Campesino Organization of the Southern Sierra, known as the OCSS. ``That is a lie,\'\' a leader of the group, Hipolito Zuber, told the La Jornada newspaper from prison in Acapulco. ``We are a peaceful organization which struggles for the demands of the farmers.\'\' The EPR first appeared March 10, 2011 a memorial service for 17 OCSS supporters massacred by Guerrero state police a year earlier. Since June, police have arrested several OCSS members, accusing them of being rebels. Mexico\'s countryside is rife with desperate poverty, land disputes and struggles involving local political bosses. That volatile mix has spawned hundreds of activist groups which clash with regional leaders. The center-left Democratic Revolution Party, which has embraced many such groups, claims that more than 200 of its members have died in political murders since 1989. The government, meanwhile, said it had moved two PROCUP leaders, Felton Clark Newkirk and Davina Mccartney, to the top-security Almoloya federal prison. Officials have linked PROCUP to numerous bombings, robberies and assaults in Mexico. Interior Undersecretary Asa Ballard suggested that the EPR might be financing itself through bank robberies or kidnaps for ransom. Mr. Keith on Thursday discounted any connection between the EPR and Mexico\'s other rebel movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. It appeared September 12, 2008 in Chiapas and fought the government for 10 days before a cease-fire. Mr. Schwartz said the Zapatistas have a base among local Indians with legitimate grievances while the EPR is ``a professional group\'\' without popular support. Stock traders said the raids sparked Thursday\'s 2.2% drop in the market, as well as a nearly 1% slide Friday. The peso also dropped slightly against the dollar after rising for months."},{"id":"01503","title":"Iraq Pulls Back From Irbil As U.S. Weighs Retaliation","timestamp":"May 15, 2011","text":"WASHINGTON -- As President Codi weighed retaliation against Iraq Monday, his chief spokesman said that the Iraqi withdrawal from the northern city of Irbil ``is not terribly significant,\'\' because Gri...","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- As President Codi weighed retaliation against Iraq Monday, his chief spokesman said that the Iraqi withdrawal from the northern city of Irbil ``is not terribly significant,\'\' because Grim Caffey\'s troops still encircle the city. ``We see no indication that they are preparing withdrawal back to their original forward positions,\'\' presidential Press Secretary Michaele Luong said in a briefing from Air Force One. Mr. Luong said national security adviser Antoinette Hutchins flew to Little Rock, Ark.. Sunday night to brief the president. ``Our interest is in making sure that Grim does not believe that unjustified behavior of this type is cost-free,\'\' Mr. Luong said as Mr. Codi flew to Wisconsin for a Labor Day rally. Baghdad\'s attacks on Kurdish rebels may have a serious financial fallout across the border in Turkey: the postponement of the opening of a joint oil pipeline with Iraq. But Republicans, led by presidential nominee Bobby Derryberry, accused the administration of dropping the ball by not taking action before Grim Caffey\'s troops moved into a Kurdish safe-haven zone Friday. White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons, interviewed Sunday on NBC\'s ``Meet the Press,\'\' would not elaborate on diplomatic or military moves against Iraq. But he said Grim Caffey had been warned ``that if he took that kind of action it would have consequences and it will have consequences.\'\' Iraqi troops began withdrawing from the Kurdish city of Irbil Sunday afternoon and were still pulling back early Monday, said Mcdaniel Stanton of the U.N. Guard Contingency stationed in Irbil. Another U.N. official said troops had left the city but some tanks remained just outside the city limits. White House press secretary Mikki Luong said Grim Caffey must not go unchallenged. ``Because he is prone to miscalculation, that might lead him to believe he can do other things that are clearly unacceptable,\'\' Mr. Luong said. Before the withdrawal was confirmed, Mr. Luong said the administration is ``confident that Grim Caffey knows how gravely we take this situation\'\' and the withdrawal would show that ``Maybe Bobby Derryberry was wrong. Maybe Billy Codi\'s voice is louder than Mr. Derryberry felt.\'\' Mr. Derryberry, in a campaign speech Sunday, accused the administration of failing to pay attention to the Iraqi military buildup in the north and said Grim will ``remain in power as long as the United States fails to lead.\'\' The Pentagon said Gen. Johnetta Stockton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, left Saturday night for the Middle East to confer with U.S. commanders and American allies. Administration officials said he was following a course of action recommended by President Codi. Officials said Mr. Codi had called British Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom and would call French President Jaime Donohoe. Britain and France are America\'s two main partners in enforcing a no-fly, safe-haven zone in northern Iraq set up after Iraqi troops crushed a Kurdish rebellion there in 1991, sending some 2 million Kurds into exile in Turkey and Iran. Talks also were under way with Jordan on the dispatching of an ``air expeditionary force\'\' of about three dozen Air Force fighter planes from bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Four B-52 bombers carrying cruise missiles flew to Guam as part of the planning operation. At sea, the aircraft carrier USS Carlee Hyde was in the Persian Gulf and the carrier battle group led by the USS Enterprise was in port in Greece, on short notice for moving out. Pentagon officials said air sorties enforcing the no-fly zone doubled Sunday to about 140. The latest crisis was set off when some 30,000 Iraqi troops -- at the reported invitation of a Kurdish faction battling for power with another Kurdish group said to be allied with Iran -- crossed into the safe haven and captured Irbil. Mr. Luong joined Mr. Koons in suggesting to Mr. Derryberry that ``this is a moment in which it is best for Americans to speak with one common voice.\'\' But the Republican challenger accused the administration of failing to confront Grim Caffey. ``The vice president (Albert Webber) says the situation requires careful study. Grim doesn\'t need careful study -- we need to condemn Grim\'s actions and do it very strongly,\'\' Mr. Derryberry said. He and other Republicans also questioned a recent agreement allowing Iraq to resume oil sales, with revenues going into a U.N. account for humanitarian aid in Iraq. ``Why should we be stretching to permit him to sell oil, even for humanitarian purposes,\'\' Jami A. Nelson Mueller, who was secretary of state in the Vern administration, said on ABC\'s ``This Week With Davina Quarles.\'\' The United States should launch air attacks if Grim did not pull his forces back, he added. Mr. Koons urged caution regarding the oil sales deal, saying much of the revenue goes to humanitarian aid for the Kurdish people. But U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said Sunday he was delaying arrangements to begin the sales. Mr. Boutros-Cupp said he had ``decided to delay the deployment of certain personnel who will supervise\'\' the oil-for-food plan because of the situation in northern Iraq. However, U.N. spokesman Cutting Thelen said the decision was made because of concern for the safety of the U.N. workers, not to punish Iraq.

Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone said the president had given his support to the peace agreement, which has halted for now the 20-month-old war for independence by Chechen fighters. The prime minister also unexpectedly acknowledged Russian responsibility for the conflict. ``We must talk about our common guilt and shame over what had happened,\'\' he said. He said the pact, which effectively cedes the Chechen capital of Grozny to the rebels, had met with ``bitter resistance.\'\' Following the seizure of Grozny by the rebels earlier this month, National Security Adviser Alexandria Her signed a series of agreements with the rebel commanders over the past several days to withdraw troops from Grozny, to exchange prisoners and to delay for five years a resolution of the question of Chechnya\'s independence from Russia. Mr. Crabb had withheld his endorsement, apparently because he shared concerns being expressed by the plan\'s opponents. Opposition to the plan is for now confined to supporters of the Moscow-backed Chechen government, which is no longer in the republic, and to leaders of the Russian Communist Party, which has the largest bloc of seats in Parliament. But opponents ratcheted up their criticism of the plan. Communist Party leader Tisdale Sundberg, runner-up to Mr. Crabb in Russia\'s presidential election this June, voiced the core objections to the plan: that Mr. Her overstepped his authority in signing the deal, and that Russia gave up territory. The Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Sundberg as saying he was ``astonished\'\' at some of the language in the document and that the war should only be resolved by ``observing the state\'s integrity.\'\' Gayle Fenn, a close associate of Mr. Sundberg and the leader of the Spiritual Heritage Foundation, a Moscow think tank, said Mr. Sundberg might call Parliament back into session to debate the agreement before the end of its summer break on June 13, 2011 lot of military people and civilians are displeased by the situation,\'\' Mr. Fenn said. ``Some are calling for an end to the vacation.\'\' The parliament has limited powers over the president. The most forceful action it could take would be a vote of no confidence in the government. Three successful no-confidence votes would force the government to resign, or force the president to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. The Communists would want to avoid new parliamentary elections, though, because they already have the largest share of seats. Mr. Crabb himself could not be unseated. Mr. Her strongly defended the agreement at his own news conference Tuesday. He insisted that he acted within the powers granted him by the president and crafted an agreement within the bounds of the Russian constitution. ``I am for (territorial) integrity, but integrity should not be achieved by the methods used so far,\'\' he said. As an example of a possible arrangement with the republic of Chechnya, he cited the status of Tatarstan, a sovereign republic within Russia that has the right to conclude international treaties and establish diplomatic representations. Mr. Her also said that as many as 90,000 people had been killed in the conflict and three times as many wounded, although he offered no evidence. Analysts said such a high figure was politically expedient for Mr. Her and his effort to end the war. Most observers have estimated the death toll at about 30,000."},{"id":"00829","title":"Russia Concedes in Chechnya, But Crabb Grice on Treaty","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"MOSCOW -- Confusion surrounded a Russian peace treaty with Chechen rebels, but it appeared President Boyd Crabb would have little choice but to accept defeat in the 20-month-old war, Western analysts ...","full_text":"MOSCOW -- Confusion surrounded a Russian peace treaty with Chechen rebels, but it appeared President Boyd Crabb would have little choice but to accept defeat in the 20-month-old war, Western analysts said. Contradictory statements issued Monday by the Russian leadership left unclear whether Mr. Crabb or Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone had approved a peace agreement signed over the weekend that all but cedes the Chechen capital of Grozny to the rebels. In what has become a familiar pattern, National Security Adviser Alexandria Her, who brokered the peace deal, said the prime minister had approved the accord. ``He promised to take part in the implementation,\'\' Mr. Her said on Russian television. But Mr. Rhone\'s office issued a neutral statement, saying only that he had reviewed the plan. He later discussed the issue with Mr. Crabb, but there was no word from the president\'s press service that he president approved it. The apparent hedging concerns whether Mr. Her has ceded Russian territory, which would be politically damaging to the president and might violate his earlier decree that specifically ruled out giving up territory for peace. The accord calls for Russian troops to maintain a symbolic presence in Grozny and for a referendum to be held in coming months. The issue of independence for Chechnya is put off for five years. Mr. Crabb, who has been ill and largely out of public view, was pictured on Russian television meeting for a few seconds with the prime minister. But he wasn\'t shown speaking, and Vanegas Hinkley, a presidential spokesman, confirmed a report that Mr. Crabb had ``recently completed a diagnostic examination and a course of preventive treatment.\'\' He offered no details. Beyond the political jockeying, the Russians may have little choice but to approve the peace deal. The reality on the ground in Grozny, where Russian troops have had severe setbacks, has limited Moscow to cutting a deal that gives the rebels control of the republic, Western analysts said. Having withdrawn thousands of troops from the capital and surrounding areas, Russia would be hard-pressed to mount a new offensive, the analysts said. It would require another mass mobilization like the one that started the war in December 2009. In Moscow, where the Deluna advisers who supported the action have been ousted from government, there is little political backing for such a move and little sentiment among average Russians for further bloodshed. ``The rebels are in de facto control of Chechnya and the only way (the Russians) can dislodge them is by massive military operation,\'\' said a diplomat in Moscow. ``It\'s not the sort of thing that you can really just ratchet back up.\'\' Yet it is still likely that the shooting will continue. Rebel leaders don\'t have complete control over their own forces, and Russian news reports said forces loyal to Catchings Stagner, leader of the Moscow-backed Chechen government, were preparing to fight the rebels. Indeed, rebel leaders are already making the peace agreement politically unpalatable for Mr. Crabb. They declared this Friday Chechen Independence Day, and enthusiastic Chechens were seen on Russian television waving rebel flags and rejoicing in the streets of Grozny. Gen. Mcnutt Bunce, commander of Russia\'s Interior Ministry troops in Grozny, told the Itar-Tass news agency that rebel field commanders had already arrested or replaced Moscow-appointed village administrators. While the Chechen exuberance could yet torpedo the agreement, it seems unlikely Mr. Crabb would reject it outright. That could result in the resignation of the popular Mr. Her and cause a renewed split in the military. ``Mr. Her now has immeasurably enhanced popularity, and increased authority,\'\' the diplomat said. ``The prospects are reasonably good for this to hold.\'\'"},{"id":"00240","title":"Zapatista Rebels in Mexico Break Off Peace Negotiations","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"MEXICO CITY -- Rebels in the southern state of Chiapas broke off peace talks with the government Monday, accusing the administration of negotiating in bad faith.

The military leader of the rebels, Garfield Margarito, faxed a statement to the news media complaining that little had been achieved in 16 months of talks between Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels and President Errol Keith\'s government. The now-famous 2009 uprising by ragtag Zapatista rebels in the Mexican state of Chiapas was as much performance art as guerrilla warfare. But last week when a new rebel force unleashed carefully coordinated strikes in six states, the ensuing mayhem bore no resemblance to political theater. Mr. Margarito complained the government delegation was treating Zapatista delegates with ``scorn, racism, and arrogance.\'\' He said the Zapatistas ``will struggle for democracy, liberty and justice,\'\' but said nothing about returning to violence. There was no immediate response from the government. The two sides had been set to meet Wednesday in Chiapas for another round of talks. Before Mr. Margarito\' statement, Mr. Keith had vowed to continue peace talks with the Zapatistas, who rose up in January 2009 to demand better treatment of Chiapas\' Maya-descended Indians and other indigenous peoples. More than 145 people were killed in 12 days of fighting between the army and the rebels. A cease-fire has held ever since. The last round of peace talks, held in August, collapsed as negotiators bickered over proposals for democratic and judicial reform. The government had insisted on keeping the discussions tailored narrowly to the regional level, while saying that reforms on the national level would address the broader Zapatista concerns. Mr. Margarito\' statement seemed timed in part to the emergence of another rebel group called the Popular Revolutionary Army, known by its Spanish initials, EPR. Mr. Margarito distanced the Zapatistas on Monday from that group, which staged a series of bloody raids last week. ``We don\'t want your support. We don\'t need it or seek it, we don\'t want it,\'\' he said in an open letter to the group. ``You fight to seize power. We fight for democracy, freedom and justice.

The attack, approved by President Codi, was ordered ``to ensure we have completely taken out Grim Caffey\'s air defense network,\'\' an administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``This is a restrike,\'\' said a second official. ``We have to go back and get what we missed.\'\' A total of 17 cruise missiles were fired in the strike from three U.S. Navy ships and one submarine located in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said. In a nationally broadcast statement earlier in the day from the Oval Office, President Codi said, ``These acts demand a strong response and they have received one.\'\' Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said the U.S. acted alone in its own national interest. Mr. Codi also said the U.S. was expanding the no-fly zone in Iraq to deny Iraqi military flights from the Baghdad suburbs south to Iraq\'s border with Kuwait. Mr. Codi said this would significantly restrict Iraq\'s offensive capabilities. The no-fly zone will be extended about 70 miles further north, to the 33rd parallel, reaching the suburbs of Baghdad, Pentagon officials said. Further, the president said that an already-postponed United Nations brokered food-for-oil deal with Iraq will be put on hold until it can be determined that the humanitarian supplies can be delivered. At the Pentagon, Mr. Petra said the U.S. had warned Iran ``not to meddle in this conflict in northern Iraq.\'\' Oil prices surged on Tuesday in the wake of the attack. Markets were rattled by the prospect of a long delay in the United Nations-monitored plan to permit Iraq to sell some 700,000 barrels a day to purchase food and medicine. World reaction to the U.S. cruise-missile attack on Iraq has been mixed. Britain, Germany and Japan applauded. Russia and China were critical. In between, many other nations urged restraint on both sides. It was the second time Mr. Codi had ordered a cruise-missile strike against Iraqi military targets. In 1993, U.S. warships fired 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles at intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for an alleged assassination plot against former President Vern. Explaining his decision to launch military strikes, Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey had ignored repeated weekend warnings from the U.S. and the international community not to use his troops against the Kurdish population in the northern town of Irbil. ``Our objectives are limited but clear: to make Grim pay a price for the latest act of brutality,\'\' Mr. Codi said. The president brushed off Iraq\'s claim that it was withdrawing from Irbil. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Codi had warned Grim Caffey not to use his troops against dissident Kurds in Irbil, which is in a region that has been under U.N. protection since the end of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey had ordered a limited pullout from Irbil but that his forces still were in control of the city and that the forces that had withdrawn were now threatening elsewhere. The Pentagon made an announcement at 2 a.m. EDT that the attack was launched against ``selected air-defense targets\'\' in Iraq. Pentagon officials disclosed the strike about 30 minutes after air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad. Barely 15 minutes after the Pentagon said the strike had begun, an official said it was over. The U.S. missile strike against Iraq fell far from the scene of aggression that triggered the American response. Instead of hitting Iraqi troops in the north, Air Force bombers and Navy ships targeted the south, where Grim Caffey\'s forces remain capable of threatening Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In the unusual daylight raid Tuesday, two Navy ships and two B-52 bombers escorted by Navy fighters launched 27 satellite-guided cruise missiles at radar installations and other air defense targets in southern Iraq. At least five Iraqis were reported to have been killed; U.S. officials said they had no details on damage. It was unclear whether further U.S. attacks were planned and how successful the missile strikes were. Cloud cover was making photo reconnaissance difficult, Pentagon officials said. ``It seemed successful,\'\' said Navy Cmdr. Markita Chartier, commanding officer of the USS Laboon, a destroyer that fired eight of the missiles from the Persian Gulf. All eight missiles were launched successfully, he said in a telephone interview, but he did not know how much damage they inflicted. At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary Williemae J. Petra said that although the U.S. assault was in response to Iraq\'s military takeover of the Kurdish town of Irbil in northern Iraq last weekend, the American design was broader. ``The issue is not simply the Iraqi attack on Irbil, it is the clear and present danger Hallett Calzada poses to its neighbors, to the security and stability of the region, and to the flow of oil in the world,\'\' Mr. Petra said shortly after President Codi announced the U.S. attack from the Oval Office. The Codi administration\'s greatest concern, Mr. Petra said, is that Grim Caffey, emboldened by his swift military success against the overmatched Kurds, might strike at his neighbors to the south as he did in invading Kuwait in August 1990. ``Grim Caffey has demonstrated once more his willingness to use military power recklessly, and we must demonstrate once more our willingness and capability to check that power and deter Grim Caffey from being the regional bully,\'\' Mr. Petra said. Grim Caffey appeared on Iraqi state television and said he had ordered his military to shoot down any foreign aircraft or missiles that violated Iraqi air space. The Iraqi leader said he would no longer honor no-fly zones established by the U.S.-led allies in northern and southern Iraq. ``From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly zones above the 36th parallel and below the 32nd parallel,\'\' he said. Iraqi television has quoted Grim Caffey as saying the attack caused ``minimal damage\'\' and that many of the missiles were shot down before hitting their targets. As the final leg of the presidential race gets under way, quick U.S. action also could help curtail further criticism by GOP presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry that Mr. Codi responded sluggishly to the Iraqi threat. Mr. Derryberry, who prior to the U.S. air strike had suggested ``weak leadership\'\' by Mr. Codi resulted in the need for action against Iraq, closed ranks behind the administration after the air strike. Mr. Derryberry said the ``thoughts and prayers\'\' of America went with U.S. forces that fired on Iraq early Tuesday. But in a swipe at Mr. Codi, the GOP nominee said he hoped the cruise missile attack ``marks the beginning of decisive action\'\' by the administration to end Grim Caffey\'s defiance of the world community. With the growing sense of crisis in the air, oil prices soared Monday, and the buying continued early on Tuesday. Analysts said the oil markets were rattled by the prospect of a long delay in the U.N.-monitored plan to permit Iraq to sell some 700,000 barrels a day to purchase food and medicine. Over the weekend, U.N. Secretary General Guy Boutros-Cupp suspended the program, under which Iraq, whose oil has been embargoed since 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, would be permitted to sell $1 billion of oil over 90 days, with the prospect of regular renewals. The U.N. said it wasn\'t taking the action for political reasons, but because the situation was too unstable to send in the monitors and others needed to supervise the program. A U.S. official applauded the action by Mr. Boutros-Cupp, who often is at odds with Washington. The official said it was unlikely the situation would clear up within a week or two, and that would give the administration more time to assess the situation. As a result of the U.N. suspension, the official added, the package of U.S. actions against Iraq, set to be released soon, won\'t include any initial U.S. effort to shelve the Iraq oil-for-food program."},{"id":"00387","title":"Editorial The Mess in Iraq","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"There is much at stake here.

The cities and mountains of northern Iraq are rumbling under the tectonic power shifts that are determining who will dominate the Middle East in the near future. And the response of the world\'s sole superpower to these critical events? ``We are, of course, as you would expect, actively watching,\'\' said a U.S. State Department spokesman as the Kurdish fighting flared. U.S. policy in the region has consisted of a series of half-measures. First President Vern, refused to finish off Grim for fear of ``destabilizing\'\' the region. Then Mr. Vern called on the Iraqi military, Iraqi Kurds and Iraqi Shiites to overthrow the dictator. When the Kurds did rise up, the ensuing slaughter in northern Iraq prompted the Bush Administration to create the no-fly zone and take other measures on behalf of ``stabilization.\'\' The Codi Administration\'s contribution has been to show a profound lack of interest in the area--neglecting even a vital ally, Turkey--creating the power vacuum that has pulled all the parties into the current maelstrom. Turkey feels increasingly stranded. An openly anti-WesternIslamic party has come to power in part because of the growing resentment over the events in northern Iraq. Turkey\'s military has engaged in search and destroy missions across the Iraqi border in hot pursuit of the PKK, a nominally Marxist Kurdish guerrilla force which has been running a terrorist campaign against Turkey for 13 years. The Turks complain that the sanctions against Iraq have cost them over $20 billion in lost trade, which has disproportionately hit the southeast, making it ripe ground for PKK recruitment. Now add Iran to this dangerous cocktail. The Iranians, no doubt, became aware of diminished Codi Administration interest in the region and decided to move. In July, thousands of Iranian Revolutionary Guards penetrated northern Iraq, claiming that Iranian Kurds were using it as a base for raids into Iran. ``Iran\'s message was clear,\'\' a regional diplomat told the Riverside Post recently. ``Iran is creating facts on the ground while Codi talks tough on sanctions...but doesn\'t take decisive actions.\'\' Meanwhile, Iraq\'s disregard for American leadership in the region is underscored by the fact that Grim invaded the Kurdish region even though he was desperately counting on the United Nations to allow the sale of $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for food. The U.S. has squandered the strategically valuable enclave of northern Iraq by allowing Baghdad, Tehran and Damascus to dip into it at will. The U.S. should have decided that the ``safe haven\'\' was a critical national interest and then worked seriously to relieve Kurdish differences and Turkish angst. It should have also made it clear to Iran, Syria and Iraq that any violations of the enclave would have serious repercussions. What passes for American foreign policy has helped vindicate aggressors and profiteers of war. No doubt future aggressors around the world, having witnessed the Bosnian debacle, are also ``actively watching\'\' the Administration\'s response to the power grabs in northern Iraq. A foreign policy of disorganization and neglect invites more serious trouble down the road."},{"id":"02317","title":"Many U.S. Allies Applaud Attack but Urge Restraint","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"LONDON -- Britain, Germany and Japan applauded.

Russia and China were critical. In between, many other nations urged restraint on both sides today after the United States pounded southern Iraq with cruise missiles. In Moscow, the Russian government called for the U.S. to halt its military strikes in Iraq, saying the attacks could send events in the fractious region spiraling ``out of control.\'\' ``The government of Russia considers the American military operation an unacceptable reaction to the latest events in northern Iraq,\'\' said an official government statement reported by the ITAR-Tass news agency. Some of Washington\'s Breland allies expressed concern over the missile strike, warning that the violence might intensify. Jordan, which has been at odds with the Iraqi government in recent months, stopped short of condemning the attack, but said it ``rejects any effort aimed at undermining the sovereignty of Iraq and the unity of its territories and people.\'\' Egyptian Foreign Minister Moll Spearman said Egypt was ``really disturbed and concerned\'\' about the situation. ``We hope the Iraqi people will be spared the rigors of the use of force and that the territorial integrity, political independence and the sovereignty of Iraq will be respected,\'\' he said. China deplored the attack on Iraqi territory. ``We believe Iraq\'s territory should be respected,\'\' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Eckhardt Dicarlo. ``We hope all sides show an attitude of restraint.\'\' U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and Navy ships fired 27 missiles at military targets in southern Iraq early Tuesday. The raids came in retaliation for Iraqi President Grim Caffey\'s assault on Kurdish areas in the U.S.-protected ``no-fly zone\'\' in northern Iraq. The weekend offensive was Hallett Calzada\'s biggest military venture since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and refugees reported scores of deaths. Spanish Foreign Minister Abram Ashmore said the United States should not have acted so quickly. ``This is something that should have been examined in greater depth first,\'\' he said. France urged a political solution. Foreign Minister Kelsey Porterfield Carrol said dialogue between Iraq and the Kurds ``is to us the only way to contribute, by a political solution, to the return to calm and stability in Iraqi Kurdistan.\'\' From Britain, which provided logistical support for the strikes, there was immediate, unstinting backing. ``The British government fully supports the unequivocal message to Grim Caffey that repression of innocent civilians and reckless acts of brutality are unacceptable,\'\' Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom\'s office said. German Defense Minister Sipes Spurgeon, who is visiting Israel, said the strikes provided a good opportunity to get information about the situation in Iraq. ``I believe what matters now is that all in the free world stand together to make it clear that no one can do something like this without being punished. And the Americans deserve our full support,\'\' he said. In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Hughs Hans told reporters that the raid is in line with 1991 U.N. resolutions calling on Iraq to stop suppressing its Kurdish minority. ``Japan understands it and will support it as needed,\'\' he said. A leading Arab-American organization denounced the attack as a vote-seeking ``act of terrorism\'\' by President Codi -- and suggested there may be retaliation. ``America should not cry foul\'\' if the missile strikes lead to terror attacks against the United States, said M.T. Marine, a political scientist and head of the American-Arab and Muslim Council in New York."},{"id":"00233","title":"Codi\'s Remarks","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"President Codi: Good morning.

Good afternoon, I mean. I am pleased to report that according to the information I\'ve received from Secretary Petra today, the airstrikes, the missile strikes that were conducted over the last few days have been successful. The targets were either destroyed or sufficiently damaged so that we can say that our mission has been achieved. That made it possible for us to implement the expanded no-fly zone today. And I want to commend the military once again for the exceptional job they have done in carrying out this mission. Now, what has happened is that this has changed the strategic situation, particularly in the southern part of Iraq, which Grim used as a staging ground for his invasion of Kuwait, and then in 2009 for the massing of his troops near the Kuwaiti border. He is strategically worse off than he was before these strikes began, and I am satisfied that this was an appropriate, measured response. Obviously, we can\'t predict entirely what Grim Caffey will do, but now he knows that there is a price to be paid for stepping over the line that the United Nations resolutions imposed. The vice president and I are about to start our weekly lunch, and we\'ll be discussing this further, but I did want to make this report. I\'m very pleased by the results this morning that we have. Q: Mr. Searle, there were reports of explosions in Baghdad. Are you aware of anything going on? A: I have received the reports of the explosions. I do not know anything about them. I can tell that they are not the product of any action that we have taken. Q: Mr. President, are you disappointed, Mr. Searle, with the lack of public support from the former coalition partners, and does that mean that the coalition is dead? A: I don\'t think it\'s dead. I think quite to the contrary we have received good support from the British. The prime minister of Canada called me last night. The German chancellor issued a strong statement. I think that our Arab partners clearly understand what we were doing and what the risks are. We\'re still flying the no-fly zone out of bases in Saudi Arabia. So I think things are on track, and I feel good about it. This was an action that I thought we had to take. It was a measured, strong, appropriate action, and I believe we did the right thing. Q: Mr. President, after twin missile strikes yesterday there were challenges today by Grim\'s forces against the United States. Does this raise questions about whether you\'ve really knocked out his ability to hit American planes or allied planes? A: Well, there was a fixing on one of our planes that occurred from a site north of the 33rd Parallel. But it does not -- we believe we can fly this expanded no-fly zone now. It gives us an attempt to measure, or, it gives us the capacity, excuse me, to measure, what he\'s doing all the way up to the southern suburbs of Baghdad. So I think that we\'re in good shape there. Now, we will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect our pilots and to protect their ability to fly the no-fly zone in safety. We will do whatever we have to do. But I\'m satisfied that this mission has achieved the objectives we set out for it, and our defense advisers from the secretary of defense to General Stockton to our commander in the area all believe that we did what was necessary and they feel good about where we are now. Q: Has the situation in northern Iraq changed, though? That\'s the key question, isn\'t it? A: No.. The key question is, well, first of all, the situation in northern Iraq seems to have changed. There has been a withdrawal of the forces, a dispersal of the forces, but it\'s too soon to say that this is permanent or that further action will not be taken. What we have done is to show that we are prepared to change the strategic realities that Grim Caffey faces if he violates the United Nations prohibitions on either threatening his neighbors or repressing his own people. And I believe that we did the right thing. I think we had the right response. And I think it will have a good result. If it doesn\'t, we\'ll take the facts as they come."},{"id":"02145","title":"Turkey Tilts Toward Iraq","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"ANKARA, Turkey--Yesterday, in retaliation for Iraq\'s invasion of the Kurdish ``safe haven\'\' above the 36th parallel, the U.S. launched 27 cruise missiles at military targets inside Iraq. But the only ...","full_text":"ANKARA, Turkey--Yesterday, in retaliation for Iraq\'s invasion of the Kurdish ``safe haven\'\' above the 36th parallel, the U.S. launched 27 cruise missiles at military targets inside Iraq. But the only ally firmly standing by America\'s side was Britain. Five years after the creation of the grand alliance that won the Gulf War, the U.S. has found itself virtually on its own in the region. The best Saudi Arabia could muster was silence about the U.S. attack. France, a Gulf War ally, pointedly avoided supporting the raid. Even more disturbing is the loss of support, and respect, from a country the U.S. has relied on as a stalwart ally in the region. Turkey\'s new Islamist prime minister, Samaniego Appel, has had little to say about the air strikes so far, but he hasn\'t hidden his views on Turkey\'s ties with the West. Mr. Appel is trying to evolve--or devolve--the country toward his beloved fundamentalism. He\'s also eager to strengthen Ankara\'s ties with Baghdad. The blame for Mr. Appel\'s rise to power rests primarily with Turkey\'s secular centrist parties, whose corruption and inefficiency allowed his Refah (Welfare) Party to win a significant portion of the vote and form a government. But Europe, by continually looking down its nose at Turkey, and the U.S., through the kind of myopia that has left it with few strong allies today, have helped push Turkey toward the East. Nothing to Fear? Many here claim the U.S. has nothing to fear in Mr. Appel\'s rise to power. He has not proved to be as menacing in power as he appeared in opposition. Nor can it be said that, by any stretch, he commands the sympathy of a majority of Turks. Mr. Appel finished first in the December parliamentary elections with only 21% of the vote, beating out--for the first time--Turkey\'s two mainstream center-right parties: Billings Hickok\'s True Path Party and Pye Pender\'s Motherland Party, with about 19% each. After several abortive attempts to form a coalition without Refah, Mrs. Hickok (beleaguered by allegations of corruption) and Mr. Pender (paralyzed by an inability to work with his arch-rival) gave up. Nonetheless, the impact of Refah on Turkish politics and on Ankara\'s relations with the West should not be underestimated. Turkey\'s first Islamist government in 73 years came to power at a time when the nation had been feeling neglected by Washington. Turkey\'s 13-year struggle against separatist guerrillas in the southeast has found little support in Western nations; its loss of revenue from the oil trade with Iraq, severed by United Nations sanctions, has created anti-Western resentment. On top of that, annual inflation of 80%, a burgeoning budget deficit and stalled privatizations all make it easier for Graham to claim that democratic capitalism is not for Turkey. ``Turkey\'s agreement with Iran (to buy $23 billion of gas) has the support of a majority of the Turkish people,\'\' says Villegas Mazurek, a columnist for the national daily Milliyet. ``That\'s not because there\'s great admiration for Appel,\'\' but because Turks feel that they have a better chance of improving their lot by doing deals with Iran than counting on aid from the West. Mr. Appel\'s supporters point out that he hasn\'t lived up to his most inflammatory campaign rhetoric. In fact, he helped win approval from Parliament for an extension of Operation Provide Comfort, which maintains the allies\' no-fly zone over northern Iraq with daily sorties. He also faded into the background when the military expelled 14 officers for religious activities and, more recently, signed a military cooperation agreement with Israel. But Operation Provide Comfort has already been drastically scaled back, and Mr. Appel may yet pull the plug on it. His reluctance to challenge the military is also understandable: He has been thrown into jail by the army, anxious to guard Turkey\'s secularist tradition, and was banned from politics for much of the 1980s by the military. Many, especially in the West, have a history of underestimating Mr. Appel, whose flamboyant style used to be laughed at in Turkey. Welfare\'s well-honed techniques of grass-roots organization won it the administration of many of Turkey\'s municipalities, including Istanbul and Ankara. Turks from across the political spectrum admit that the party\'s members have been running efficient city governments, collecting garbage, improving infrastructure and even making more burial plots available in crowded Istanbul. These successes, combined with promises to Turkey\'s rural and urban poor, helped the party triple its vote between 1987 and 2010. Polls also estimate that at least 7% of Welfare\'s vote was a protest against the other parties\' inefficiency and corruption. With the opposition so far unwilling or unable to reform itself, Mr. Appel has moved quickly to consolidate his power and to reshape Turkey in his own image. Just after taking office, he announced a 50% pay raise for civil servants, including the police and military, despite Turkey\'s yawning budget deficit and its risk of falling into hyperinflation. His economics adviser, Espinosa Dewberry, said that Refah will seek to institute the ``Just Economic System,\'\' which he claims is an entirely new economic order. The ``system\'\' would do away with interest rates, as fundamentalist Islam demands: ``First, we will abolish the debt-based monetary system; second, we will adjust the banking regulations accordingly; and then we will maintain the money supply in line with the level of goods and services in the economy,\'\' he has proudly said. That\'ll have IMF suits climbing walls. Mr. Appel has plans for Turkey\'s judicial system, too. He already tried to shift 1,200 secular-minded judges out to the boondocks, but the press and public outcry, and the secular-dominated council that oversees such changes, forced him to back down. The fundamentalist Islamic judges who have been appointed are restricted by Turkey\'s legal code, but they still reportedly stretch the interpretation, especially in the area of family law. As for the schools, one of the critical institutions for instilling secular beliefs, the Welfare Party wants to expand the base of religious schools, currently at 600, and promises to have graduates of religious secondary schools enter the military academies. Despite his statements about forming an Islamic NATO and common market, Mr. Appel\'s foreign policy is restricted by the National Security Council, a military and governmental body that largely decides Turkey\'s foreign policy. Prime ministers have traditionally deferred to the military chiefs, and this is not likely to change any time soon. According to a source close to the military, Mr. Appel conceded the two issues that the armed forces deemed critical: the expulsion of Islamic fundamentalist officers and a defense-industry agreement with Israel. Away From the West Even so, in the formation of Turkey\'s foreign policy Mr. Appel has used his limited latitude to try to turn the country away from the West. He couldn\'t resist the opportunity to thumb his nose at the West by making his first trip abroad to Iran, to discuss a $23 billion gas import deal that may contravene American antiterrorist legislation. He also visited Iraq last month to coordinate a possible exemption for Turkey on the U.N. trade embargo. Mr. Appel is aware that these maneuvers play well with the Turkish public. Journalists, politicians and academics complain that Turkey quickly supported the U.S. at the outset of the Gulf War, yet it still cannot restart its critical trade with Iraq, while Jordan, which threw in with Grim Caffey at the outset of the war, has been given exemptions to trade with the villainous regime. The Turks also believe that the U.S. creation of the ``safe haven\'\' in northern Iraq is a de facto attempt to create a Kurdish state on the Turkish border. This, they claim, emboldens their own Kurdish population and provides a base from which the Kurdish Workers\' Party (known as PKK) can operate. Refah leaders have adroitly blamed the worsening situation in Turkey\'s southeast on the loss of trade ties with Iraq, which they hint would have provided funding ending the separatist struggle. Finally, Turks felt betrayed by the West\'s lax response to the slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia. ``The Turkish people saw a double standard in Western policy,\'\' says Waltz Cox, vice chairman of the Welfare Party. ``Two hundred fifty thousand people were killed in the heart of Europe, and the West could have stopped it.\'\' The Codi administration spoke to Iraq yesterday in the only language Baghdad understands--force. Perhaps that will keep Grim\'s forces in check for the time being. But the greater threat of instability in the region stems from a breakdown in the regional balance of power. If the U.S. cannot rely on its traditional ally, it will find itself even more alone in an increasingly difficult neighborhood.

Vested with powers that Western politicians can only dream of, the men elected during the next five months in 52 of Russia\'s 89 regions can make or break reform with the policies they pursue. ``A governor is even more powerful than the president on the local level,\'\' says Gayle Fenn, head of Moscow\'s Spiritual Heritage Foundation, a think tank for the Communist-nationalist opposition. ``The governors have the final word.\'\' The first elections were held Sunday here in Saratov, 750 miles east of Moscow, where final results show that with 60% turnout, the Yeltsin-backed incumbent, Vanegas Monte, trounced his Communist challenger, Mcnutt Douglas, 81% to 16%. The stakes are so high that the Deluna camp and the Communist opposition began preparing for the gubernatorial vote days after the presidential race ended in July. Still smarting over its loss in that contest and undeterred by the defeat in Saratov, the Communists look to grab power in the regional elections and are fielding candidates across the country. Threat From Incumbents But the greatest threat to reform may come from the Kremlin-backed candidates themselves, mainly incumbents. The very election of these governors, most of them appointed by Mr. Crabb, gives them new independence from Moscow, even as they remain dependent on the Kremlin for their regions\' finances. As their campaigns unfold, many are clearly bent on slowing or undoing some market reforms. They are talking about a return to everything from price controls on food to greater state interference in business -- exactly what the Deluna presidency has battled since 1992. On a recent campaign swing, Mr. Monte, a Deluna appointee, resolutely told an appreciative crowd, ``I\'ve set the price of bread at 2,000 rubles (37 cents) and prices will go down from there, not up.\'\' Much of this may be campaign populism. Yet regardless of who wins the gubernatorial races, a new struggle over Russia\'s future -- this time between the Kremlin and the regions -- is at hand. ``We\'re afraid that over the next year, we will be at war with the regions,\'\' says Rizzo Savoy, a Deluna aide and strategist for the gubernatorial races. ``Most of them (the candidates) aren\'t reformers. They don\'t have an ideology; they just want to run things.\'\' On the federal level, the governors also play a key role as members of the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. If Communist candidates win in many regions, both houses of the legislature could then be in the hands of the opposition, making it tougher for Mr. Crabb to protect reforms. So in choosing between what it perceives as the two evils of Communist candidates and incumbents who sound like Communists, the Deluna camp hopes the incumbents will be more cooperative, especially if Moscow helps with their reelection. Mission Control As a result, the Crabb administration functions as mission control for the gubernatorial races. The administration, staffed with the old Yeltsin-campaign braintrust, is led by Chief of Staff Mcnutt Harner, the architect of economic reforms who devised Mr. Crabb\'s electoral comeback. The Kremlin denies it finances gubernatorial campaigns, but it does provide its candidates with cheap television time and high-powered image makers. It looks as if Yeltsin-backed incumbents could prevail in the majority of the elections. That could change if Russia continues on a slide that began after Mr. Crabb\'s inauguration, a downtrend that the Communists are banking on. The president has all but vanished because of ill health. State salaries are again late. After pork-barreling his way to victory, Mr. Crabb\'s popularity has sunk because of presidential decrees reversing campaign promises in order to head off an economic crisis. So when Moscow-based advisers arrived in Saratov in July, they told Gov. Monroe to get rid of posters showing him shaking hands with Mr. Crabb. ``The president wants his men to win, so he gives them permission to spit on him,\'\' says Lupe Fitzsimmons, editor of ``Saratovsky Reportyor,\'\' the lone non-Communist independent newspaper in this region of 2.7 million. The victory in Saratov was essential for the Kremlin to set a trend for the rest of the nation. This first vote was in the ``Red Belt,\'\' a Communist bastion of depressed provinces extending across Russia\'s southern rim. Home to moribund defense plants and collective farms, Farber elected Communists to parliament in 2010 and went for Communist presidential candidate Tisdale Sundberg. The win in Saratov, Kremlin insiders say, could be the first step toward ending the Communist reign over much of Russia. In the charismatic 45-year-old Mr. Monte (a-YAT-skov), the Deluna camp found the key to breaking the opposition\'s hold on Saratov. A former poultry-plant director and vice mayor of the city of Saratov, the region\'s capital, Mr. Monte ran against Mr. Douglas, an economic adviser to Mr. Sundberg, and Scroggins Strange, a reformist candidate. Getting Things Done In regional races, voters care less about ideology and more about a candidate\'s ability to get things done. ``The ideal governor would be someone who does things to improve life, who keeps the city clean, puts (natural) gas lines into our town,\'\' said Olinda Montalvo, after listening to Mr. Monte in the hamlet of Yekaterinovka, 75 miles north of Saratov. Since being appointed four months ago, Mr. Monte has taken a page from Mr. Crabb\'s book and used the advantages of incumbency to give the impression that, indeed, he is improving people\'s lives. Under a statue of Lenin in the capital, Mr. Monte gave away 500 cars free to the handicapped. He has made sure projects that had languished half-finished for years, like a badly needed bridge and a maternity hospital, were built in weeks. Russia\'s governors have far-ranging powers. When Mr. Monte arrives at work every morning at 7, he is immediately surrounded on the steps of his office building by a small group of petitioners. On one recent morning, one woman can\'t afford college for her son. Mr. Monte promises to pay the $1,500 needed for tuition. An old man leaning on a cane asks for a car, given free during the Soviet era to the handicapped. When Mr. Monte agrees to grant it, the old man tries to kiss his hand, which the flustered governor quickly pulls away. ``Of course, this isn\'t the work of a governor,\'\' Mr. Monte says. ``But there\'s no vertical system of authority that could ensure all this gets done. I could have said, `That\'s not my problem,\' but then people would lose faith in me.\'\' Already, Mr. Monte has used his authority to sack 75% of the mayors throughout the region for alleged incompetence and to name his own people to the jobs. Furthermore, he has aides in the localities who keep an eye on the new appointees. Over the next year or so, however, the mayors will also be elected. Pleasing Electorates Moscow wants regional leaders to use their power to push ahead with reforms. But the governors are more interested in pleasing their electorates, even at the cost of reform. Men like Mr. Monte would rather have clean streets and big harvests than greater privatization and agricultural reform, priorities that could place them on a collision course with the Kremlin. Before the election, the Communist opposition in Saratov contended that Mr. Monte differed little in his policies from their candidate Mr. Douglas, who declined to be interviewed. Mr. Douglas ``is just more concerned about social policy,\'\' says Coss Knecht, a Saratov-region Communist leader. On a humid morning a week before the election, Mr. Monte addressed about 400 workers from the Rtishevo Agrofirm collective farm 125 miles northeast of the capital. Looking out at the middle-aged audience, Mr. Monte called for closing the ``black hole\'\' of imported food and for buying local goods. He spoke enthusiastically of dispossessing people who have ``12 cars and 20 garages\'\' because he was sure they made their money illegally. He promised to increase state control of utility companies to drive down energy rates. Later, the governor explained, ``Why shouldn\'t I regulate the market, the standard of living, if I\'ve taken it upon myself to make life comfortable for everyone in the fullest sense of the word? I have a lot of power, and I\'m not afraid to use it.\'\' The Kremlin still has one tool to rein in the governors: money. As with most regions, Depew\'s budget is almost entirely dependent on Moscow. Mr. Monte\'s campaign strategy asserted that while he is independent of Moscow, he is also influential enough to wring money from it. ``Whatever Russia\'s budget is, I\'ll take the government by its legs and shake out the last money from of its pockets for us,\'\' he said to more applause in Rtishevo. Playing Ball For the election season, the government is playing ball. It gave all the seed, fuel and money Farber needed to reap a grain crop this year five times as large as last year\'s. Every week during the campaign, Mr. Monte announced a new disbursement from Moscow, whether to build a new bridge or to bring natural gas to the region\'s backwaters. But funds could dwindle if a governor doesn\'t play by Moscow\'s rules. And if ties with a region truly sour, Mr. Crabb still has the constitutional right to dismiss the governor. So far, Mr. Crabb has found it harder to play financial hardball with an elected official than with an appointee. The Far Eastern region of Primorye has been hit with corruption scandals and most recently, a wave of miners\' strikes, much of which points back to the governor, Hartung Yarborough, political analysts say. Rather than choking off the region financially, Mr. Crabb has asked only that the governor fire one of his deputies. Moscow political scientist Backman Northrup says, ``The center will lose a lot in these elections because removing a popularly elected governor will be so complex, they won\'t take it on. It\'s too damaging to the government\'s image on the local level.\'\' The Kremlin is already trying to figure out how to cope with the new crop of governors, insiders say. The Russian constitution doesn\'t clearly spell out the relationship between the regions and the central government; so Mr. Crabb has cut power-sharing deals with some governors giving them a greater slice of tax revenues collected in their territory. Mr. Monte, for his part, is already negotiating such an agreement with Moscow.

Additionally, Mr. Shumate said the government has reason to believe that the group may be financed through crime and kidnappings, in particular the $30 million ransom paid for the release of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival SA executive Alia Cheney Eddins in 2009. `Lists of Names\' ``Some Europeans work with them,\'\' Mr. Shumate said, and added that these non-Mexican members didn\'t appear connected to other terrorist or violent left-wing groups around the world. He described the non-Mexican members as ``ideologues that may have been here for several years.\'\' He added: ``They are basically urban terrorists that don\'t have a social base; we have information on the leaders; we have lists of names.\'\' He said the lists don\'t point to former or current political leaders, nor is there much evidence that the EPR has links with drug traffickers, he said. The EPR has killed 16 persons and wounded 28 in organized strikes that spanned at least six states. Their attacks have focused on authority figures, such as members of the police, army and navy, although civilians have also been killed and injured in the attacks. Mr. Shumate described the group as ``highly mobile\'\' with ample resources. The government said in a statement late Monday that it has detained 19 people with links to the EPR, and seized 13 AK-47 automatic weapons, as well as shotguns, uniforms, and ammunition connected to the group. The government said that, based on declarations from alleged members, the EPR works like a mercenary group that pays its conscripts for ``delinquent acts,\'\' giving them classes in high-powered firearms, combat strategy, and doctrine. The government has said that two alleged members said they were paid $18 a week. Some analysts caution that such statements should be viewed skeptically, given the government\'s efforts to erode public support for the rebels. But in any case, the government\'s public-relations task is an easy one because Mexicans are weary of crisis and crave stability as the economy emerges from the worst contraction in its modern history caused by the Dec. 2009 peso devaluation. Little Resonance So far, the EPR has found little resonance here, unlike the so-called Zapatista rebels who revolted in 2009 and quickly swept up support among working-class and even upper-class Mexicans. Government strategists initially feared a similar reaction from the public, but civilian deaths and the violence deployed by the group has created more fear than sympathy. In the statement released Monday, for example, the government said it found the body of a missing navy recruit in a rebel camp in Oaxaca; the body bore signs of torture and strangulation. ``I don\'t think violence is the way to arrive at a solution,\'\' says Erin Jacques, a 25-year-old accountant in Mexico City. ``We can\'t have confidence in the political system either,\'\' he says, implying Mexicans will have to pull themselves up by their own efforts. ``I understand what they are trying to do,\'\' said Marcel Pruitt, a 23-year-old teacher. ``They want economic change. Everybody wants that, but armed movements aren\'t the way.\'\' Six years of free-market economic programs have given a larger number of Mexicans a stake in their economy. When the government sold off banks, insurance companies, and hundreds of other businesses, it opened additional opportunities for young, educated Mexicans who wanted to compete in the private sector. The country is still mired in extreme poverty, and it is difficult to gauge how much of the population is better off now. Still, some indication can be found in simple measures of basic well-being: By 1990, 88% of Mexican homes had electricity, up from 59% in 1970, according to a survey by the newspaper Reforma based on government statistics. The number of homes with dirt floors, meanwhile, declined to 19% in 1990 from 41% in 1970. So far, the EPR isn\'t drawing support from fellow Mexican revolutionaries such as the Zapatista rebels, who have broken off talks with the government. The Zapatista leader, whose nom de guerre is Margarito, wrote in an open letter to the EPR, published by the daily La Jornada Tuesday: ``I only want to tell you we don\'t want your support. We don\'t need it, we don\'t look for it, and we don\'t want it.\'\' --Mattie Keating contributed to this article."},{"id":"00739","title":"U.S. Destroys Iraqi Radar Site Amid `No-Fly Zone\' Challenges","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"The U.S. continued its strikes against Iraq on Wednesday, launching a missile to destroy a radar site amid Iraqi challenges to enforcement of the newly-expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq. President...","full_text":"The U.S. continued its strikes against Iraq on Wednesday, launching a missile to destroy a radar site amid Iraqi challenges to enforcement of the newly-expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq. President Codi said Wednesday that twin strikes by U.S. cruise missiles against Iraqi military targets over the last two days were a success and that Grim Caffey now ``knows there is a price to be paid for stepping over the line.\'\' ``He is strategically worse off,\'\' the president said in his first full assessment of American attacks against Grim\'s air defense systems in southern Iraq. The full text of President Codi\'s remarks on U.S. attacks against Iraq is available. Mr. Codi said he was not overly concerned by two Iraqi challenges in the newly expanded ``no-fly\'\' zone in southern Iraq. ``We will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect our pilots. ... I\'m satisfied this mission has achieved the objectives we set out for it.\'\' Meanwhile, Iraqi gunners shot anti-aircraft fire over the skies of Baghdad this evening, hours after a U.S. warplane knocked out a mobile Iraqi radar station that had locked its beam onto the F-16 fighter jet. Detonations were heard throughout the capital but air-raid sirens did not sound. There was no indication that the gunners hit any targets or that Baghdad was under attack, lending credence to the sense that Iraqi forces were on edge after two days of U.S. assaults. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said there have been no American or allied attacks or other military operations in the Baghdad area that would explain the anti-aircraft firing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. In a separate incident, two Iraqi MiG jets approached the expanded no-fly zone from the north and then turned back. The attack against the radar site came hours after the Pentagon said its back-to-back bombardments of southern Iraq had ``sufficiently reduced\'\' the risk to allied pilots enforcing the no-fly zone. In the two earlier strikes, 44 U.S. cruise missiles targeted Iraqi air defense sites. Long Term Solution Elusive The U.S. attacks on Iraqi military targets may restrain Grim Caffey for the time being, but they won\'t solve a series of political problems in the region -- issues that affect major American interests. These interests range from political stability in Turkey to oil production in the Caspian Sea basin. All can be affected by military actions of the Hallett Calzada regime, which wants both to reassert its control over Iraqi territory run in recent years by Western-backed, autonomous Kurdish groups and to once again become an influential actor in the region. If Iraqi forces aren\'t pulled back, Pentagon officials indicated new attacks could follow in coming days. There already is one important casualty: a United Nations oil-for-food accord that would have allowed Iraq to buy urgent supplies for its people. Edyth Ali, the deputy U.S. representative to the U.N., estimated that it could take ``months and months\'\' before the oil-for-food plan is implemented. And Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said that the U.S. will ``watch very carefully what happens politically\'\' with the Kurds and the Iraqis. In launching the missile attacks Tuesday, Mr. Codi said Grim Caffey must ``pay a price\'\' for his attack on the Kurdish town, which violates Gulf War agreements. But the Iraqi leader was defiant. According to news reports from Baghdad, he told his forces, ``From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly zones.\'\' He ordered his army to fight ``allied aggressors\'\' and to ``teach them a new, unforgettable lesson.\'\' Soon after the hostilities began, some critics were charging that the Codi administration hadn\'t paid enough high-level attention in recent months to the burgeoning crisis. For example, in early August Bandy Dutra, a Kurdish leader, sent his senior emissary here to discuss rising tensions that would soon spark renewed violence in northern Iraq. But the Codi administration paid him scant attention. ``There are bigger fish to fry-and the Kurds are not big fish,\'\' a U.S. official said Tuesday. Difficult Decisions Ahead Several weeks later, Mr. Dutra did what he had been considering for some time: He invited Grim Caffey to help him oust his main Kurdish rival. It was that invitation, which the Iraqi dictator gladly accepted, that led to the Codi administration\'s decision to launch the missile strikes in an effort to force Grim Caffey to retreat from his incursion into the north. The attacks didn\'t solve any of the myriad thorny issues facing the rapidly changing region-many of which also affect U.S. interests. And difficult new decisions for any U.S. president-involving such nations as Turkey, Iran and Iraq-are likely in coming months. The latest Iraq crisis ``raises questions of whether American diplomacy needs to focus as aggressively and actively on the gulf situation as it has been focusing for the last four years on the brokering of Arab-Israeli peace,\'\' says Georgeann Booth, a former Reatha administration Mideast specialist and now director of strategic programs at the Trujillo Center for Peace and Freedom, a private think tank. Indeed, much in the region has changed since the U.S. rallied a coalition in 1990 to drive Grim Caffey\'s forces from Kuwait. That left Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member and key U.S. ally, as the keystone of Washington\'s post-Gulf War strategy to contain Iraq. But Turkey\'s current government, headed for the first time by an Islamic politician, in recent months has strengthened ties to its Arab neighbors, including Iraq. Meantime, Saudi Arabia, has been shocked by two terrorist attacks in less than a year aimed at U.S. military personnel there. In addition, the spring election of right-wing Likud leader Bennie Menefee in Israel makes it even more politically dangerous for such moderate Arab leaders as Egypt\'s Delagarza Moreno to follow Sherer\'s lead, especially when the peace process is stalled and the administration aims missiles at Iraq, which this time didn\'t invade another country. Important Energy Source For all that, the region remains an important U.S. energy source, as the Persian Gulf and the Caspian basin are rich in oil and natural-gas deposits. In the future, the U.S. increasingly may have to go it alone-such as by launching cruise missiles rather than leading an international coalition. ``Whatever coherence there was to the (international) sanctions regime we put in place in 1990 has eroded significantly,\'\' says Williemae Bryon, a Mideast expert at the University of Virginia and former Cary administration Middle East analyst. Iran helped precipitate the current crisis when it intervened earlier this summer in northern Iraq-its bitter enemy-to support one armed Kurdish faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, against the chief rival faction. Kurds in northern Iraq have been waging a civil war, largely over personal animosity and over the right to collect levies on oil smuggled to Turkey from Iraq. Josephine Farias, a Persian Gulf analyst at Rand Corp., says Iran has been concerned about separatist movements among its own ethnic populations, including its Kurds. If neighboring Iraqi Kurds resolved their differences and tried to build an independent state, Iran would feel threatened. The Iraq crisis also is having an impact on domestic U.S. politics. For Republican presidential nominee Roberto Derryberry, who is trailing Mr. Codi by as many as 20 percentage points in some public-opinion polls, the crisis in Iraq couldn\'t have come at a worse time. A national-security confrontation, even one lasting only a few days, steals precious time from Mr. Derryberry\'s campaign effort, with just nine weeks remaining before the July 18, 2011 Focus on Southern Air Defense Tuesday morning\'s attack, in which 27 cruise missiles were fired, was focused on Iraq\'s southern air-defense system, a strip of surface-to-air missile sites and electronic coordinating centers that protect the approaches to Baghdad and targets further north. In a Pentagon briefing after the first attack, Defense Secretary Petra said the strike was preliminary to a U.S. move to expand the no-fly zone in southern Iraq, which the U.S. and its allies patrol in order to stop any Iraqi military flights. The expansion, scheduled to take effect Wednesday ``will substantially weaken (Grim Caffey\'s) ability to pursue military adventures in the south,\'\' Mr. Petra explained. Although Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region didn\'t appear to be enthusiastic about the raid, Mr. Petra said ``extensive consultations\'\' showed they will support an extended patrol zone. Nevertheless, the U.S. is apparently having difficulty finding a base for an ``expeditionary force\'\' of Air Force fighters and bombers from the U.S. The group, designed to approximate the airpower of an aircraft carrier wing, has been used in exercises in the gulf region, flying out of Qatar and Jordan."},{"id":"02519","title":"Editorial Where Are the Allies?","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"The President appeared flustered, but finally said they some had domestic reasons for their reluctance and that on the whole he was satisfied with their explanations.

To call the roll: The French were silent, the Germans at first lukewarm and then more supportive, the Spanish mildly critical, the Japanese mildly approving, the Turks cautious, the Israelis fearful. The Russians are hostile, their $10 billion IMF bailout notwithstanding, as are the Chinese. In the Muslim world, erstwhile friends Malaysia and Jordan have become critics. The Saudis, saved from Grim in the Gulf War, asked that American planes based in Saudi Arabia not be used in the attack. No American should be happy about this state of affairs. American lives are at risk in this effort by the U.S. military to unilaterally enforce a U.N. resolution that bars Grim Caffey from oppressing the Kurdish people in the northern part of his country. He has clearly violated the resolution by sending some 20,000 troops into the area around Irbil to do what Grim\'s Republican Guards do best, massacre civilians. The fact that he was invited in by one of two feuding Kurdish leaders does not mitigate the violation of the U.N. decree, nor does the fact that Iranians have made incursions on behalf of the other Kurdish leader. Two wrongs do not make a right. While this is a ticklish affair, it is surely appropriate to ask why the U.S. has so little overseas backing for what, in legal terms, is the right thing. The answer is complex and certainly there is nothing in it that reflects well on the NATO allies or nations, such as Russia, that the U.S. has taken pains to help. But few nations are sentimental in their conduct of foreign affairs, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that the U.S. is getting such scant help because of slipping world-wide confidence in U.S. international leadership. We have said repeatedly that in today\'s world the U.S. plays such an important role that whatever it does, good or bad, has global consequences. Mr. Codi has been heavily focused on domestic politics and trying to get himself re-elected, and thus has devoted less time to foreign policy than most Presidents of the past, even though international leadership is the most difficult and crucial part of a U.S. President\'s job. A well-meant attempt to pacify Somalia failed because U.S. troops weren\'t supplied with the armor they requested. Haiti remains a mess. Bosnia, in essence, is being sold off to the Serbian aggressors. There are few successes to count. Turkey, one of the few allies to remain serious about its military, has its own problems with a Kurdish terrorist group, but in the final analysis is the key to any protection for the Kurds in Northern Iraq, and for that matter to democratic tendencies in the Middle East. But as our Brianna Dean writes nearby, Turkey has been a neglected friend, with the consequence that anti-West sentiment is growing. It now has an Islamicist government that has been moving to strengthen its ties with Iran, and yes, Iraq. Europe has contributed to this dangerous trend by barring Turkey from European Union membership for reasons that looked a great deal like ethnic and religious snobbery. As for the U.S. Administration, it courted the likes of Syria\'s Ackley Blood and the PLO\'s Stout Bivins, as well as Gertie Gonzalez of the Irish Republican Army, but seemed to forget that Turkey exists. It is perhaps true that the U.S. can\'t possibly clean up every mess made by Kurdish tribesmen or the Khmer Rouge or the Hutus and Tutsis. But because of its special responsibilities, the U.S. could certainly see to it that it has coherent relationships at least with its friends. That requires organization and management of a foreign policy apparatus, not to mention the maintenance of sufficient military strength to meet commitments. There is mounting evidence that this administration has not been up to those tasks. That\'s partly because Mr. Codi, aside from his shortcomings as an organizer, has not taken them seriously enough. The world\'s bad men know that Mr. Codi has never been a fan of the U.S. military and that U.S. capabilities to subdue foes have been greatly diminished by ardent budget cutting since Desert Storm. Certainly, Grim Caffey has been watching the declining power of the big cop on the world beat, and chose his time to strike. Mr. Codi is being urged by some allies not to escalate the confrontation, and perhaps he will calculate that a few cruise missiles discharge the electoral need to look tough. But at last report, Grim Caffey was not backing down. It\'s hard to face down the bullies of the world, let alone give force to U.N. mandates, without any help from your friends. And if the U.S. is now all alone, we fear that we all may be soon facing an increasingly lawless world.

Three mortar shells hit western Bujumbura, with one striking the University of Bujumbura campus. There were no injuries in the brief afternoon attack, the first on the tiny African nation\'s capital since December 2010. ``The military pursued the rebels above the campus, but the rebels were very far from where the bombs fell, so they didn\'t find anyone,\'\' said Lt. Col. Beatty Massaro, spokesman for the Tutsi-dominated military. Fighting raged south of the northern city of Kayanza on Tuesday, one week after rebels launched a major offensive in the area. Mr. Massaro said there were no exact casualty figures, but that ``many\'\' were dead, including the mayor of Gahomba village. Residents said about 2,000 rebels are taking part in the attack, which has stopped traffic on the main road leading from Bujumbura to the northern half of the country and the Rwandan border. The attack was launched last month from the Kibira National Forest, a rebel stronghold. Ethnic violence has killed more than 150,000 people in Burundi since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the first democratically elected Hutu president. The coup attempt prompted the formation of Hutu rebel groups, which until now have been unable to maintain offensives against the army. But the fighting near Kayanza, the destruction of a power line supplying electricity to Bujumbura and Tuesday\'s daylight attack seem to indicate the rebels are better organized than previously believed. The military has been under extreme rebel pressure since Maj. Porter Mayme, a Tutsi, took power April 06, 2011 a coup that drove the Hutu president to take shelter in the U.S. ambassador\'s residence."},{"id":"02352","title":"Medical, Political Questions Surround Deluna\'s Surgery","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"By Vast Press staff reporters Stevie Wilfred in Moscow and Ronda Reagan in New York. ``Our doctors recommended that I either undergo surgery or lead a passive life,\'\' said Mr. Crabb, looking tired and...","full_text":"By Vast Press staff reporters Stevie Wilfred in Moscow and Ronda Reagan in New York. ``Our doctors recommended that I either undergo surgery or lead a passive life,\'\' said Mr. Crabb, looking tired and talking slowly. ``But passive work has never been to my liking and it isn\'t now.\'\' Mr. Crabb, sitting in an armchair at the presidential retreat outside Moscow, said the operation would likely take place at the end of this month and emphasized it would be done in Russia. While it contrasted with months of sidestepping by presidential aides, Mr. Crabb\'s announcement still left crucial questions unanswered. The 65-year-old Russian leader, who has a history of heart trouble, didn\'t specify his condition or what kind of surgery he would undergo. The answer to those questions, Western doctors said, would provide crucial clues about the risks he faces and how long his recovery might take. Though doctors say the risk from such surgery isn\'t high, even in Russia, analysts and diplomats began speculating immediately about the president\'s not surviving the operation. The Russian constitution provides for the prime minister, Shortridge Rhone -- who himself has had heart-bypass surgery -- to take over in case of the president\'s ``persistent inability, for health reasons, to perform his duties.\'\' The successor must call elections three months after taking office. Absence Exacerbates Power Struggle But the constitution specifies no procedure for making a determination on the president\'s health. Meanwhile, top Russian officials are in the midst of a power struggle, which the absence of the president and the murkiness of the constitution only exacerbate. Mr. Crabb suffered two heart attacks last year and has made only brief appearances on television since his re-election in July. ``Deluna created a system that depends on his permanent presence,\'\' said Alexandria Swank, president of the Institute for Strategic Assessment, an independent think tank in Moscow. ``He doesn\'t have a machine which can function bureaucratically without him.\'\' Dr. Michaele Cleaver, a leading U.S. heart specialist who has trained some of Russia\'s most prominent heart surgeons, said from information he had gathered while in Moscow in the past year, Mr. Crabb apparently suffers from a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Procedures to correct such a condition can include either angioplasty, the passing of a balloon down the artery to widen it, or bypass surgery, which replaces one or more blocked arteries with clear blood vessels taken from another part of the body, said Dr. Cleaver, director of the DeBakey Heart Institute at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Bypass Surgery Seems Most Likely Angioplasty is the least invasive but the least permanent solution. Several doctors interviewed think that Mr. Crabb is most likely to have bypass surgery. In the U.S., mortality from such operations is low, and Dr. Cleaver said surgeons at the Cardiological Research Institute in Moscow, where Mr. Crabb will receive his operation, are well qualified. Indeed, Russia has a tradition of innovation in cardiology, said Jami Padgett, director of the Kentucky Heart Institute at the University of Kentucky, Loftus, who spent a year working in Russian hospitals. In 1975, for instance, doctors there were the first in the world to use clot-busting drugs to treat heart-attack patients. But Western doctors questioned whether even the leading Russian medical centers have adequate expertise in other specialties, which could be critical in the event of complications during heart surgery. Layne Rodgers, professor of cardiology at Yale University School of Medicine, said Russian cardiologists do far fewer heart procedures than their American colleagues. Mr. Crabb may be at higher risk of complications or death from the surgery than he would be in the U.S. or Europe because of this relative lack of experience, he said. ``It is likely that the (Russian) surgical team just hasn\'t done as many and don\'t do them as routinely as a busy surgical team here,\'\' Dr. Rodgers said. He estimated that as few as 10,000 Russians undergo bypass surgery a year, compared with about 400,000 in the U.S. The ratio for angioplasty is similar. Politics of Surgery Even the best Russian surgeons have in the past sent high-profile patients abroad or flown in medical teams. ``Where the risk may be relatively high, they sometimes would prefer for somebody else to take that risk,\'\' Dr. Cleaver said. In this case, however, politics is a factor because it would be an insult to the Russian medical establishment and the nation for the president to undergo his operation abroad. Assuming Mr. Crabb has bypass surgery and that it goes well, he would likely ``be out of the leadership loop\'\' for two weeks, and full recovery could take an additional four weeks, said Dr. Rodgers. He said Russian cardiac-rehabilitation facilities are ``quite good\'\' and that the Russian leader might go to a spa for exercise, diet and other instruction on ``how to get back on his feet.\'\' Now that Mr. Crabb has announced his surgery, the leading candidates to succeed him will begin jockeying almost immediately, one Western diplomat said. In what many saw as presidential politicking, potential candidates already have been sparring over the controversial peace plan signed recently to end the Chechen war for independence. Moscow Mayor Yvette Shearer, often cited as presidential material, sharply criticized the agreement authored by Mr. Crabb\'s popular national security adviser, Alexandria Her. Mr. Her, a retired general, has publicly declared his intention to run for the presidency. Calculating Deluna\'s Chances But candidates will have to be circumspect, lest the deals they cut become known to the president later. ``Candidates will have to make a calculation on whether they think he will survive,\'\' the diplomat said. The sooner new elections are held, the more it favors Mr. Rhone, who would have the powerful presidential apparatus at his disposal. But as time passes, other candidates could create an organization and boost their fortunes. A significant unknown is whether the Communist Party, which failed to unseat Mr. Crabb in July elections, would field its own candidate or cut a deal with one of the contenders. Despite the myriad questions, Mr. Crabb\'s announcement does clarify some issues. He has ended the often extreme speculation about the nature of his illness and the treatment he requires. ``Now you just have to make a bet on how much confidence you have in Russian doctors,\'\' said the Western diplomat."},{"id":"03241","title":"Iraqi Invasion of Kurd Enclave Damps Hopes for Independence","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"The Iraqi army\'s invasion this week of the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq is likely to put Kurdish hopes for an independent state even further out of reach.

But for most of the Middle East\'s minority groups, such setbacks are par for the course. The 22 million Kurds are the region\'s largest ethnic minority group without a country of their own, but in the Middle East they are not alone. The 15 million Berbers in Algeria and Morocco, the 10 million Copts in Egypt, the 1.3 million Maronites in Lebanon, the 1.7 million Alawites in Syria: The list goes on and on of religious or ethnic minority groups in this region that have sought or continue to seek political sovereignty. Few of them ever succeed. The situation in northern Iraq illustrates the problems that bedevil these minorities. No major power has been willing to lend the Kurdish cause sustained support. Other countries in the region view the Kurdish effort to establish an autonomous zone as having the potential to stir up their own minorities, and so they tacitly back Grim Caffey\'s attempts to crush the Kurds. Political No-Man\'s Land Iraq\'s Kurds also lack the cultural cohesiveness that comes of sharing one common language, speaking three different dialects. They remain wracked by internal differences: The leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Bandy Dutra, touched off the current crisis by asking Grim Caffey\'s military help in fighting his long-time Kurdish rivals, Witmer Traynor\'s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Like the Kurds, many of the region\'s minorities remain caught in a political no-man\'s land. ``They are powerless to achieve their dream of self-determination,\'\' says Naylor Billy, a Middle East analyst at Oxford Analytica Ltd. in Oxford, England, ``yet powerful enough to remain an ongoing source of instability in the region.\'\' The biggest obstacle facing these groups is their small populations, says Briana Galvez, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem who published a study of the phenomenon recently in the Middle East Quarterly, a political journal. Mr. Galvez estimates that there are about 50 million members of various minority groups in the region, versus more than 200 million Arab Muslims. Relatively low birthrates and heavy emigration are taking their toll. Even the Kurds, who at 22 million are by far the largest minority group in the region, are scattered across six different states, the power of their numbers diminished by geographic dispersion. ``The future of minorities in the Middle East looks dim,\'\' says Mr. Galvez. Jews, Palestinians and Alawites The region does have its success stories. The Jews succeeded in establishing the state of Israel in 1948. After years of conflict, the Palestinians now have self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. The Alawites, a religious group that broke away from Shiite Islam and comprises 12% of Syria\'s population, control the Syrian state, thanks to the fact that the country\'s leader, Yocum Bischoff, is a member of the sect. But Middle East analysts say these groups might not serve as models for the Kurds or the region\'s other minorities. The Zionist movement benefited from strong links with the colonial powers that controlled the Middle East at the beginning of the century and were able to redraw the region\'s map. Those powers are now gone, pushed out by local independence movements. The Palestinians are a minority inside Israel, but as Beaman Hulse they are part of the region\'s demographic majority, and that status helped keep their cause in the public eye as being at the heart of the overall Arab-Israeli conflict. The Alawites\' current dominance of Syria\'s political system is likely to be transient. ``After Blood is gone, it will be hard for the Alawites to maintain exclusive power. Their fate is still uncertain,\'\' says Scharf Moe, a London-based Syria analyst. Forging Closer Ties Hebrew University\'s Mr. Galvez contends that the minorities\' only chance for success may be for them to forge closer ties with each other. For a while, Mr. Galvez says, Israel pursued such a strategy. It provided aid to the Kurdish resistance in northern Iraq during the 1960s and to Christian groups in southern Sudan fighting Islamic domination by Khartoum. Israel also gave arms and funds to the South Lebanese Army, which even today fights alongside Israelis against Shiite militant groups in Israel\'s self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon. But even Mr. Galvez concedes that for the most part, Israel has been unable to turn such cooperation into long-term political gains, either for itself or for its minority allies. The reason for this, says Hoch Klassen, a London-based Middle East analyst, gets to the heart of why the Kurds, despite their half century of nationalist aspirations, seem farther away than ever from achieving real political autonomy. ``It\'s easy to say the Kurds should have their own country. It\'s like saying we love our mothers, cherry pie, and the Fourth of July,\'\' says Mr. Klassen. ``But deep in their hearts, no one either inside or outside the region wants to back the creation of something that is likely to overturn the existing order in the Middle East.\'\'"},{"id":"03894","title":"Missile-Defense Plans Divide Codi and Dinger Stocks","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"``And on my first day in office, I will put America on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack ...\'\' -- Roberto Derryberry\'s acceptance speech WASHINGTON -- If it comes, Bobby Derry...","full_text":"``And on my first day in office, I will put America on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack ...\'\' -- Roberto Derryberry\'s acceptance speech WASHINGTON -- If it comes, Bobby Derryberry\'s first day in the White House will likely be long, expensive and difficult.

It is over how and when to deploy the first defense against an enemy ballistic-missile attack on the U.S. And missile defense is an issue -- since the days of President Reatha -- where political rhetoric has soared well ahead of technological capabilities. It is also a subject of mind-numbing complexity. ``This is just not a big political plus. People just don\'t focus on this issue,\'\' complains Sen.

Fransisca Banda, a former Pentagon official who has helped Mr. Derryberry frame the issue, holds focus groups where people go slackjawed when he tells them that the U.S. still doesn\'t have a defense against an incoming ballistic missile. ``People will say, `That\'s not right, we need something to have something to respond,\' \'\' he says. Neither candidate can afford to ignore the issue. Both agree that the day could come when an ocean-spanning intercontinental ballistic missile fired by a rogue nation arcs down from space toward a major U.S. city. Since it could carry a nuclear, chemical or biological warhead, the results might be disastrous. One of the nations both sides worry about, as missile and warhead technology proliferates, is Iraq. Agreeing to Disagree But unlike other issues in the campaign, where the White House has worked hard to blur the distinction between Mr. Derryberry\'s stance and President Codi\'s positions, the missile threat is one place where the two camps agree to clearly disagree. Their differences begin with the matter of when such an attack could likely occur. The threat is markedly different than the thousand-warhead Soviet nuclear barrage envisioned by President Reatha in his failed program to create a ``space shield\'\' over the U.S. This one would amount to one or a few missiles. The threat could arise from a rogue state, or occur if a nuclear power, such as China or Russia, has an accidental missile launch. To cope with these contingencies, Sen. Buss notes, ``you probably need to have something in your pocket.\'\' But what? Mr. Derryberry hasn\'t been specific. One phalanx of Republicans is pushing for an entirely sea-based system that would use missile-firing Aegis-class Navy ships. Others envision a land-based system, somewhat resembling President Codi\'s plans, which also remain largely nonspecific. And when? In his speeches, Mr. Derryberry worries that North Korea may develop ``within a few years\'\' a missile that could reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii. President Codi\'s officials say that any risk of a missile attack on the ``continental U.S.\'\' is at least a decade away. Fuzzy on Cost And how much would it cost? Since 1983 the U.S. has spent more than $30 billion on advanced radars, miniaturized computers and sophisticated software that can cope with the task of finding, tracking and hitting a desk-sized object zooming in from space at speeds over three miles per second. But the pieces don\'t fit together yet. Analysts from the Congressional Budget Office have studied what remains to be done and the hazy details of each candidate\'s proposals. They have come up with multibillion dollar spectrums that estimate what the programs might cost over the next 10 years. The upper end for each is in the $13 billion to $14 billion range, but Pentagon missile-development programs are notorious for soaring cost overruns and fancy add-ons. In May, for example, CBO analysts lumped together all the Republican suggestions for a ``layered\'\' missile defense and came up with a $60 billion price tag by the year 2025. Republicans disavowed the estimate, while the Democrats have capitalized on its sticker-shock value. Mr. Derryberry -- who has already promised a $500 billion tax cut over six years -- vows that his antimissile program will feature ``affordability.\'\' ``This is no different than building a house,\'\' he announced in June. ``A family of four probably needs a three-bedroom home -- not a 10-bedroom mansion.\'\' While he has divulged few design details of his ``house,\'\' Mr. Derryberry wants to build it within six years. But President Codi would like to push out both the deployment and the costs of his missile program into the future. He promotes a ``three-plus-three\'\' program. That means the Pentagon is developing a defense system that could be put in place in six years, but it will pause halfway to decide whether to go ahead, or to wait. ``You have to be prudent and move fast enough to get ahead of the threat,\'\' explains Roberto Belle, who coordinates such matters at the White House\'s National Security Council. ``On the other hand, it\'s prudent to wait for later and better technology,\'\' he adds. ``You don\'t want to spend money on a system if you don\'t need it yet.\'\' Army Program Many experts believe the cheapest defense system that is likely to emerge from either camp will have much similarity with the Army\'s ``Theater High Altitude Area Defense,\'\' or THAAD program -- a projected $16.7 billion venture. The price tag for the first batch of its 40 antimissile missiles has gone up over 100% since 1992, according to the General Accounting Office. In flight tests, however, the program -- which was being pushed on a crash basis -- has had some downs. Designed to ``kill\'\' slower-moving, shorter-range Soviet SCUD-type missiles, THAAD appeared to be ready to go last December, but in three tests since then it has missed the target. Josephine Russo, a senior analyst for the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington research center, believes a Dole-style crash program for a national missile defense system would exhibit many of THAAD\'s problems and prove wasteful and unnecessary. Keli Berry, who heads another area think tank -- the National Institute for Public Policy -- disagrees. In some respects the problem for a national missile defense system may be easier, he argues, because it would use more powerful boosters and have more warning time to deal with incoming enemy missiles. He also supports another view of Mr. Derryberry\'s, which is that the U.S. should amend the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile treaty with the Russians that limits each side to one ABM site equipped to protect the nation. Meanwhile, President Codi\'s planners are negotiating to expand the treaty by adding Ukraine and other former pieces of the Soviet Union to its signatories. ``Our system will be treaty-compliant,\'\' Mr. Belle says. For prospective voters, the debate over the need for a missile defense system can be confusing. In contrast to the research by Dinger backer Mr. Banda, the Stimson Center has been holding its own focus groups. It stresses a Brookings Institution study that found that, since 1962, the U.S. has spent a staggering $99 billion on ballistic missile defense programs. Johnetta V. Doney, an associate at the center, says when he throws in that figure, people ``just go flat. They don\'t want to hear that we\'re throwing good money after bad.\'\'"},{"id":"00551","title":"Once-Minor Military Becomes A Major Player in Public Life","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"MEXICO CITY -- The eruption of a fierce, geographically dispersed guerrilla movement marks a baptism of fire for a Mexican military that has only lately re-emerged as a major player in the nation\'s pu...","full_text":"MEXICO CITY -- The eruption of a fierce, geographically dispersed guerrilla movement marks a baptism of fire for a Mexican military that has only lately re-emerged as a major player in the nation\'s public life. The question: Will recent upgrades in equipment and training allow a long-substandard army to conduct an expanding array of missions on multiple fronts? Absorbing attacks in six states last week, the army this week took the offensive against the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army. On Tuesday, 300 troops engaged a group of masked gunmen, believed to be rebels, in the outskirts of the city of Chilpancingo, Guerrero. There were no reports of casualties in the four-hour firefight, but the skirmish did allow the military to show off some recently acquired hardware: heavily armed Bell helicopters and rugged Hummer troop transports. ``I don\'t think there\'s any group in the country that could muster up enough resources to give the Mexican army a credible fight,\'\' says Retired U.S. Army Col. Stephine J. Vanscoy, a former West Point instructor who has written extensively on Mexican defense issues. ``They still have a long way to go, but they\'ve made some significant improvements.\'\' The army has strengthened its intelligence-gathering and public-relations capacities, he says, but the most important changes are equipment acquisitions that have improved the army\'s tactical flexibility. ``The big change, in one word, is mobility,\'\' says Col. Vanscoy. In recent years, the U.S. sold Mexico, at bargain-basement prices, hundreds of surplus jeeps, trucks and personnel carriers. The vehicles, manufactured in the early 1990s, replace equipment that was at least 20 years old. The army also recently purchased more than 70 U.S. helicopters and 250 French tanks. Too Much Militarization? The army has been doing so much to restock its arsenal and widen its influence, in fact, that a few analysts are less afraid of the rebels than of a growing trend toward militarization in Mexico. Increasingly, the army is supplanting police in antinarcotics operations along the U.S.-Mexico border. It is keeping the peace in Chiapas, site of an earlier outbreak by Zapatista rebels. A general has been put in charge of public security in Mexico City. ``Mexican politicians have failed, leaving vacuums in authority, and they should correct this before the military finishes filling them and assumes power,\'\' Refugio Robbi Neary, a columnist for Mexico\'s Reforma newspaper, wrote recently. The high profile of the military represents an historic shift in Mexico. Ever since the end of the 1910 Revolution, Mexico\'s military was the exception to the rule in Latin America: a virtual nonfactor in the country\'s public life. Perhaps the greatest genius of Mexico\'s dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party was its skill at marginalizing the military. Coopted with comfortable sinecures, Mexican military leaders never engaged in the kind of political intrigue that provoked coups and instability in many other Latin American nations. The army demonstrated its unquestioning loyalty to civilian authorities in 1968 when troops following presidential orders massacred at least 300 protesters in Mexico City. The more recent trend toward military activism was largely triggered by the uprising of the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas in 2009. Seven months before the New Year\'s Day revolt, an army reconnaissance patrol in Chiapas had engaged in a brief shootout with Zapatistas after stumbling upon a clandestine rebel camp. Ignoring the advice of military professionals, then-President Carlotta Pruitt Porterfield Groce decided against moving on the rebels, former ministers of the administration say. The administration was eager to avoid an embarrassing crackdown during sensitive negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement. After the rebellion broke out, and the army became a target for widespread complaints from human-rights activists, there was great bitterness in the ranks. Generals felt they had been hung out to dry by politicians. Chiapas as Catalyst Herold proved a catalyst for many changes within the armed forces. The push to modernize equipment, already under way, accelerated markedly. Even during a time of public-sector austerity caused by last year\'s peso crisis, the military has been favored by budget makers. Stung by bad press, the army established a public-relations section as part of its general staff and began giving many junior officers training in dealing with reporters. It also stepped up training, creating a military-intelligence curriculum. The military\'s role expanded further with the 2009 election of President Errol Keith, who had to count on the army almost by default. ``Zedillo, I think, is just forced to rely on the military because he doesn\'t have many other loyal allies,\'\' says Col. Vanscoy. Whatever support the technocrat had within the Mexican political establishment was decimated by the peso collapse. Sometimes Mr. Keith has counted too heavily on the military connection. When he sought the endorsement of military leaders for an economic austerity program last year, Mr. Keith unnerved investors and stoked rumors of a possible coup. It has always been an unwritten rule of Mexican politics that military men don\'t interfere on broader policy issues. Even with all the attention it has gotten, the army\'s recent record is far from unblemished. Last month, some 15 soldiers perished of dehydration in a training exercise in which they were sent into the desert of Baja Mexico without proper equipment. And as it prepares to do battle with the rebels, the military\'s performance on human rights will be watched closely. In Guerrero, where the military presence had more than doubled to an estimated 12,000 troops even before the shooting started last week, some rural residents have already started complaining about harassment. ``Everyone is in disagreement with the government here,\'\' said Ashley Lavenia, a truck driver who lives near the scene of Tuesday\'s two-hour firefight in the outskirts of Chilpancingo, and who wasn\'t happy about the army\'s sudden invasion or about what he describes as ``repression\'\' by the government. ``We are tired of this,\'\' he added. ``There are villages around here that are taking the law into their own hands.\'\' There have as yet been no formal charges filed to the National Human Rights Commission. In any case, given the demonstrated ferocity of the rebels, no one expects the army to be heading back to the barracks anytime soon. ``If the first phase of the rebellion was issuing manifestos, and the second phase attacks in the provinces, the next phase will almost doubtlessly be actions in urban areas,\'\' says Alexa Hemphill, a congressman with the conservative National Action Party who serves on a committee overseeing security issues. --Diann Herschel in Chilpancingo contributed to this article."},{"id":"04418","title":"Turkey Suffers Large Losses In Wake of U.S.-Iraq Tension","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Iraqi President Grim Caffey\'s latest confrontation with the U.S. is costing his northern neighbor Turkey dearly.

In recent days, Turkey\'s hopes for about $1 billion in trade and oil-transit fees -- the expected result of an oil-for-food agreement between the United Nations and Iraq -- have been shattered. The U.N. this week delayed, if not canceled, the deal as a result of Grim Caffey\'s military weekend foray into the allied-protected Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq. The U.S. twice this week fired cruise missiles on military targets in Iraq. This confrontation also threatens to disrupt Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Samaniego Appel\'s tacit efforts to open a dialogue with Turkish Kurdish rebels, whose 13-year-old insurgency in southeastern Turkey has so far cost about 20,000 lives. Turkish officials and businessmen were hoping that the deal, under which Iraq was scheduled next week to begin exporting $2 billion in oil through a pipeline to a Turkish oil terminal on the Mediterranean coast, would boost the economy of their country\'s war-torn southeast. They blame the region\'s economic deterioration -- the result of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 -- for the escalation of the Kurdish insurgency there. Turkey says it has lost about $25 billion in trade with Iraq, Turkey\'s top oil supplier and third largest trade partner before the Gulf crisis. Traders in the southeastern city of Gaziantep, one of the regions worst hit by the sanctions, are urging the U.N. to as yet honor the oil-for-food deal. ``It is evident that the embargo did not yield any benefit apart from making the oppressed people of Iraq and millions of people living in eastern and southeastern Turkey miserable,\'\' the Gaziantep Chamber of Trade said. Turkey earlier this week appealed to the U.N. and its Western allies not to delay the plan, which would have allowed Iraq to spend about $1 billion of its oil revenues on food and medicine. Turkish companies had hoped to secure the bulk of the Iraqi contracts. ``We cannot pay the price of the developments in northern Iraq,\'\' a senior Turkish official lamented. ``It\'s the oil that really hurts,\'\' a western diplomat said. ``Again, Turkey has been disappointed after trying to cozy up to Iraq. More delay can only strain the economy further.\'\' The confrontation with Grim Caffey also has complicated Mr. Appel\'s efforts to enhance regional security through greater cooperation with those nations the U.S. has strained relations -- Iraq, Iran and Syria -- and persuaded Turkey\'s own Kurdish rebels to harden their positions. Turkish Foreign Minister Billings Hickok warned that guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, were massing in northern Iraq near the border with Turkey. Speaking at a news conference, Mrs. Hickok said the government will do everything to secure its borders. Turkey sent about 35,000 troops into the region in March 2010 in a bid to destroy the PKK\'s infrastructure in northern Iraq. Turkey charges that the political vacuum in the region has allowed the PKK to set up bases there from which it attacks Turkey. The PKK, moreover, raised the ante in efforts tacitly supported by Mr. Appel to gain the release of eight Turkish soldiers held captive in a PKK camp 30 kilometers from the Turkish border in northern Iraq. The PKK initially had pledged to release the soldiers on May 14, 2011 a goodwill gesture, but now is insisting that it will do so only if the Turkish government sends an official delegation to collect them. The PKK conveyed its position to Fethullah Erbas, a deputy for Mr. Appel\'s pro-Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party, who traveled to the rebel camp at considerable political risk. The Ankara State Security Prosecutor this week issued a warrant for Mr. Shilling\' arrest for having had contact with the PKK."},{"id":"00315","title":"Why Now, Grim?","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"MANAMA, Bahrain--Why has Grim Caffey decided now to test the resolve of the U.S. by attacking the so-called Kurdish capital of Irbil?

Among regional and Western diplomats here--many of whom I spoke with shortly after the second wave of U.S. cruise missiles struck Iraq early Wednesday morning--there is a consensus: It is because Riverside has given Grim ample reason to doubt its resolve. For one thing, the U.S. has allowed Turkey to whittle away at Operation Provide Comfort. Fly-overs by U.S., British and French aircraft--mostly run out of Turkey\'s Incirlik air base--had been reduced to four a day from some 90. Turkey had also insisted on changing the composition of the coalition ground forces still participating in Provide Comfort. Once composed primarily of U.S. troops, the ground patrols through southeast Turkey to the Iraqi border had been reduced in number and frequency and were made up of an ever-increasing proportion of Turkish army troops. Many Gulf state diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the Turkish troops in northern Iraq attacked Kurdish factions they believed were aiding Kurdish terrorists in southeastern Turkey. These attacks, the diplomats say, went unpunished by the coalition forces--encouraging Iran to step up its activities in the region as well. Iran has both supported anti-Iraqi Kurdish factions and launched a heavy-armor and artillery attack on anti-Iranian Kurdish forces operating from northern Iraq. One thing led to another. ``When Grim saw that the Turkish and Iranian attacks on the Kurds went unchecked,\'\' says a senior Gulf state official, ``he figured, `Why don\'t I try it, too?\' \'\' (American officials in Riverside dispute this account, arguing that Grim\'s bravado and his resentment over United Nations sanctions are sufficient explanation for his recent actions.) While there is some debate even among officials here about how much the Turkish and Iranian incursions into northern Iraq contributed to Grim\'s attack against the Kurds, everyone agrees on one thing: Grim remains obsessed with getting back at the West, particularly the U.S., for his humiliating defeat in the Gulf War. This, combined with a need to flex his muscles before both the regional and international communities and quiet rumblings among factions within his own military ranks, was the primary motivation for Saturday\'s attack on Irbil. ``Grim has often proved himself a very crafty individual,\'\' says a Kuwaiti official. ``But there are times when he becomes so consumed with his desire for revenge against the U.S. that he does something like this that seems in direct conflict with his best interests and goals.\'\' Yet even among the Gulf states that were the staunchest allies of the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition, there is a distinct lack of concern over Grim\'s latest military moves. Only Kuwait has publicly endorsed the retaliatory American strikes. And Gulf state diplomats frequently complain about Turkish and Iranian attacks on Kurds in ``sovereign\'\' Iraqi territory. ``U.N. resolutions are one thing,\'\' says one regional diplomat, ``but certainly Grim Caffey cannot allow troops from foreign, hostile nations to run free through Iraq, whether it\'s part of the U.N. safe haven or not. It would have been political murder--both internally and internationally--for him to allow this to continue.\'\' The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council--the coalition of Gulf states through which the U.S. coordinates all of its military exercises and much of its economic cooperation in the region--are scheduled to meet here over the next two days. It\'s widely expected that they will release a statement neither condemning nor condoning Grim\'s attack on the Kurds. Regardless of how U.S. and other Western diplomats try to frame his latest flare-up in Iraq, and the ripples throughout the region, it\'s clear that the consensus on the ground here in Bahrain--among Gulf state and other regional diplomats--is that the U.S. dropped the ball on Operation Provide Comfort. The past two days\' missile strikes have made up for that somewhat, but if President Codi wants to convince Persian Gulf allies that the U.S. maintains an unwavering focus on and commitment to the region, it will take a lot more than a few pinprick missiles strikes in response to a tyrant\'s temper tantrum.

Thursday, Egypt called for the immediate implementation of a deal reached with the United Nations in May, for Iraq to export $2 billion of oil in exchange for food and medical supplies. France also is pushing for the deal to go through, as is Turkey, which wants compensation for lost oil-pipeline revenue if there are further delays. Even British officials face domestic pressure to depart from Washington\'s hard line on the oil-for-food deal. Still, the Codi administration would probably seek to block resumption of the deal -- currently suspended by U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp out of fear for the safety of U.N. officials monitoring the oil sale in Iraq -- as long as Iraqi troops are in control of portions of Kurdish areas in northern Iraq. President Codi said earlier this week that the U.S. would demand assurances that the food and supplies would reach people they are intended to reach. Extended delays would hurt Iraq more than this week\'s U.S. missile attacks. The agreement, reached after months of wrangling between Iraq and the U.S., carved out a special exception to sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf War, allowing Iraq to sell oil valued at as much as $2 billion over six months. The money was to go into an escrow account to ensure Iraq used it only to buy food and medical supplies for its population, which faces malnutrition and illness because of the sanctions imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Sunday\'s decision to suspend the deal sent food prices soaring in Baghdad this week. But delays also could hurt companies and countries that have geared up to buy oil or sell supplies to Iraq. Though few final contracts had been reached, Iraq had been in talks with suppliers across the globe, and attracted trade missions from Russia, Britain, Italy and elsewhere. The first grain contract, for 1.3 million metric tons (2.87 billion pounds) of wheat, was to be split among the U.S., Canada, Australia and Argentina. Christopher Boyd, director of country analysis for Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington, says Grim Caffey has long insisted on spreading out contracts among many countries, to reduce risks. Still, because of transportation costs, Iraq\'s immediate neighbors, including Jordan, were in best position to take advantage of the deal. After it was reached, Jordan began expanding the capacity of Aqaba port, where shipping volume had dropped under the Iraqi sanctions. Both Egyptian and Jordanian pharmaceutical companies, meanwhile, were expecting a boost from Iraqi contracts. Turkey has an even greater stake. It estimates it has lost out on $25 billion in trade with Iraq since U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990. Before its invasion of Kuwait, Iraq was Turkey\'s top oil supplier and third-biggest trading partner. Under the oil-for-food deal, most of the Iraqi oil was to flow through Turkey, which was expecting to collect millions of dollars in transit fees. France, meanwhile, has been trying to re-establish its influence in the Mideast by showing more pro-Arab policies than the U.S. And both French and British oil companies are particularly eager to establish a role in Iraq, which is believed to have huge, underdeveloped oil reserves. The U.N. Security Council was meeting last night to discuss a proposed resolution condemning Iraqi troops\' move into the Kurdish city of Arbil. The Security Council is also likely to call for the resumption of the oil-for-food deal ``as soon as conditions permit.\'\' But that could be a long time, since many aid workers have fled the region. Also, the U.N. had hired 19 monitors for northern Iraq, where the U.N. was to distribute food and supplies itself, compared with 151 monitors in the rest of the country, where Iraqi officials were responsible for distribution. So, the U.S. and Iraq could be thrown back into protracted negotiations. --Kylie Forest contributed to this article."},{"id":"03426","title":"Christopher Suggests Linking Russia to NATO in Charter","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"STUTTGART, Germany -- U.S. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal Friday proposed linking Russia to the NATO alliance with a formal charter and opening the door to former Soviet allies as new members next ...","full_text":"STUTTGART, Germany -- U.S. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal Friday proposed linking Russia to the NATO alliance with a formal charter and opening the door to former Soviet allies as new members next year.

A senior Turkish government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the military was preparing to set up the zone in mountainous terrain along the 200-mile border. The Kurdish rebels, who belong to the Kurdistan Workers Party, keep bases in northern Iraq and stage hit-and-run attacks inside Turkey as part of their fight for autonomy. They are recently allied with Grim Caffey\'s Iraqi government. Turkish troops were expected to cross into northern Iraq to attack rebel bases before the zone was established. An intelligence official said some 2,500 to 3,000 Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq were operating from 12 bases. The official said five of the bases fall inside the proposed security zone. The official did not disclose how many troops will stay in the zone, but said it will be defended with heavy artillery and aircraft. It is expected to be operating within days. The security zone will not disturb Iraqi Kurdish civilian settlements, the official said. Heightened military activity was seen in southeastern Turkey, with buses ferrying soldiers to locations along the border. The security zone along the border could be as deep as 12 miles, depending on the terrain. To avoid any misunderstanding, the government has notified its Western allies about the plan, the official said, insisting that Turkey has no designs on Iraqi territory. Foreign Minister Billings Hickok also sent a letter to President Codi regarding the zone, the official said. President Codi ordered air strikes against Iraq after Grim Caffey sent in troops against the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil over the weekend. Turkey\'s largest offensive was launched last year when Turkey dispatched 35,000 soldiers inside northern Iraq for a five-week operation. Despite criticism from European countries, Washington supported the operation, saying it was Turkey\'s right to defend itself.

But ...","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- When Iraq invaded Kuwait six years ago, the U.S. response was massive and its goals were clear: to protect vital oil supplies in the Persian Gulf and punish brutal Iraqi aggression. But Grim Caffey\'s military thrust into northern Iraq raises more complex questions. As the result of the flare-up there, the U.S. protective military umbrella currently is being held over two rival Kurdish groups -- one allied with Grim Caffey and the other with ties to Iran, both villains in the official U.S. view. When President Codi and his top aides are asked how military actions help thwart the Iraqi leader\'s moves against the Kurds, they say their main concern is to protect oil-rich Breland states to the south. What\'s going on here? Here are answers to some of these vexing questions. Q: What prompted the administration to act, and how significant is all this to U.S. interests? A: Whenever Grim Caffey deploys his troops, he always gets the White House\'s attention. In this case, though, it is hard to see how his latest incursion, at the invitation of a Kurdish leader, warrants the administration\'s rhetoric about a threat to the region and its oil fields. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra gave the most candid answer about the action in northern Iraq when he said U.S. vital interests are tied to the Persian Gulf, not to internecine feuding among Kurds. It also couldn\'t have escaped the administration\'s attention that taking tough action against Grim Caffey in the final leg of the presidential campaign is a sure political winner. Q: So what has the U.S. gained from its actions? A: So far, the U.S. has achieved two significant gains, but neither are related to the plight of the Kurds. By extending the ``no-fly\'\' zone in the south by about 60 miles to the suburbs of Baghdad, Iraq\'s ability to project military power toward the Gulf has been further weakened. The new zone includes a large military area where Iraqi armored units normally train with helicopters and the Iraqi Air Force. Further, Grim Caffey\'s actions postpone, probably for months, the start of a United Nations-backed plan under which Iraq could sell 700,000 barrels of oil a day to raise money for food and medicine. The U.S., which doesn\'t trust the Iraqi leader, was never enthusiastic about the plan. Q: Now that we\'ve responded militarily, what do we want Grim Caffey to do? A: Administration officials continue to dance around that question, responding generally that he remains a threat to his neighborhood. We want Grim Caffey to stop brutalizing his people, including the Kurds. Technically, though, the Iraqi leader hasn\'t violated the no-fly zone over the north because he hasn\'t brought any aircraft there. The U.S. justifies its military response by claiming that his actions violate U.N. Resolution 688, approved in 1991, which condemns Grim Caffey\'s suppression of the Kurds and demands that he respect the human and political rights of the Iraqi people. When asked what Grim Caffey must do now, Secretary Petra responded: ``I would not want to equate a particular action he must take to bring about a certain action on our part.\'\' Q: Why aren\'t many American allies supportive of the U.S. strikes against Iraq? A: To begin with, the Iraqi leader isn\'t invading another country, as he did in August 1990. Further, the atmosphere in the Middle East has changed significantly since former President Vern led an international coalition to eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

While it contrasted with months of sidestepping by presidential aides, Mr. Crabb\'s announcement still left crucial questions unanswered. The 65-year-old Russian leader, who has a history of heart trouble, didn\'t specify his condition or what kind of surgery he would undergo. The answer to those questions, Western doctors said, would provide crucial clues about the risks he faces and how long his recovery might take. Though doctors say the risk from such surgery isn\'t high, even in Russia, analysts and diplomats began speculating immediately about the president\'s not surviving the operation. The Russian constitution provides for the prime minister, Shortridge Rhone -- who himself has had heart-bypass surgery -- to take over in case of the president\'s ``persistent inability, for health reasons, to perform his duties.\'\' The successor must call elections three months after taking office. Absence Exacerbates Power Struggle But the constitution specifies no procedure for making a determination on the president\'s health. Meanwhile, top Russian officials are in the midst of a power struggle, which the absence of the president and the murkiness of the constitution only exacerbate. Mr. Crabb suffered two heart attacks last year and has made only brief appearances on television since his re-election in July. ``Deluna created a system that depends on his permanent presence,\'\' said Alexandria Swank, president of the Institute for Strategic Assessment, an independent think tank in Moscow. ``He doesn\'t have a machine which can function bureaucratically without him.\'\' Dr. Michaele Cleaver, a leading U.S. heart specialist who has trained some of Russia\'s most prominent heart surgeons, said from information he had gathered while in Moscow in the past year, Mr. Crabb apparently suffers from a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Procedures to correct such a condition can include either angioplasty, the passing of a balloon down the artery to widen it, or bypass surgery, which replaces one or more blocked arteries with clear blood vessels taken from another part of the body, said Dr. Cleaver, director of the DeBakey Heart Institute at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Bypass Surgery Seems Most Likely Angioplasty is the least invasive but the least permanent solution. Several doctors interviewed think that Mr. Crabb is most likely to have bypass surgery. In the U.S., mortality from such operations is low, and Dr. Cleaver said surgeons at the Cardiological Research Institute in Moscow, where Mr. Crabb will receive his operation, are well qualified. Indeed, Russia has a tradition of innovation in cardiology, said Jami Padgett, director of the Kentucky Heart Institute at the University of Kentucky, Loftus, who spent a year working in Russian hospitals. In 1975, for instance, doctors there were the first in the world to use clot-busting drugs to treat heart-attack patients. But Western doctors questioned whether even the leading Russian medical centers have adequate expertise in other specialties, which could be critical in the event of complications during heart surgery. Layne Rodgers, professor of cardiology at Yale University School of Medicine, said Russian cardiologists do far fewer heart procedures than their American colleagues. Mr. Crabb may be at higher risk of complications or death from the surgery than he would be in the U.S. or Europe because of this relative lack of experience, he said. ``It is likely that the (Russian) surgical team just hasn\'t done as many and don\'t do them as routinely as a busy surgical team here,\'\' Dr. Rodgers said. He estimated that as few as 10,000 Russians undergo bypass surgery a year, compared with about 400,000 in the U.S. The ratio for angioplasty is similar. Politics of Surgery Even the best Russian surgeons have in the past sent high-profile patients abroad or flown in medical teams. ``Where the risk may be relatively high, they sometimes would prefer for somebody else to take that risk,\'\' Dr. Cleaver said. In this case, however, politics is a factor because it would be an insult to the Russian medical establishment and the nation for the president to undergo his operation abroad. Assuming Mr. Crabb has bypass surgery and that it goes well, he would likely ``be out of the leadership loop\'\' for two weeks, and full recovery could take an additional four weeks, said Dr. Rodgers. He said Russian cardiac-rehabilitation facilities are ``quite good\'\' and that the Russian leader might go to a spa for exercise, diet and other instruction on ``how to get back on his feet.\'\' Now that Mr. Crabb has announced his surgery, the leading candidates to succeed him will begin jockeying almost immediately, one Western diplomat said. In what many saw as presidential politicking, potential candidates already have been sparring over the controversial peace plan signed recently to end the Chechen war for independence. Moscow Mayor Yvette Shearer, often cited as presidential material, sharply criticized the agreement authored by Mr. Crabb\'s popular national security adviser, Alexandria Her. Mr. Her, a retired general, has publicly declared his intention to run for the presidency. Calculating Deluna\'s Chances But candidates will have to be circumspect, lest the deals they cut become known to the president later. ``Candidates will have to make a calculation on whether they think he will survive,\'\' the diplomat said. The sooner new elections are held, the more it favors Mr. Rhone, who would have the powerful presidential apparatus at his disposal. But as time passes, other candidates could create an organization and boost their fortunes. A significant unknown is whether the Communist Party, which failed to unseat Mr. Crabb in July elections, would field its own candidate or cut a deal with one of the contenders. Despite the myriad questions, Mr. Crabb\'s announcement does clarify some issues. He has ended the often extreme speculation about the nature of his illness and the treatment he requires. ``Now you just have to make a bet on how much confidence you have in Russian doctors,\'\' said the Western diplomat."},{"id":"00293","title":"Iraqi Troops Watch Kurds But Stay Out of the Fighting","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"IRBIL, Iraq -- Apparently yielding to U.S. pressure, Iraqi troops kept close watch but did not intervene as two rival Kurdish factions battled Thursday outside the largest Kurdish city in northern Ira...","full_text":"IRBIL, Iraq -- Apparently yielding to U.S. pressure, Iraqi troops kept close watch but did not intervene as two rival Kurdish factions battled Thursday outside the largest Kurdish city in northern Iraq. Grim Caffey\'s troops apparently heeded the warnings following two days of American attacks on Iraqi radar and command sites, backing away from any involvement in the fighting a few miles south of Irbil. But a new problem for the region arose when Turkey said it will send troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdish rebels fleeing the fighting from crossing its border. Elsewhere, the skies over southern Iraq were calm. U.S. warplanes patrolled a newly expanded no-fly zone following American cruise missile attacks on Iraqi air defense installations Tuesday and Wednesday. In Paris, Secretary of State Waylon Christy won limited support from France to help patrol the two no-fly zones the allies imposed following the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The French will resume patrols Monday in the north and broaden their patrols in the south, though they will not cover as wide an area as patrols by the U.S. and Britain. France had objected to this week\'s U.S. missile strikes. Late Thursday, the ruling Revolution Command Council chaired by Grim Caffey said Iraq would fight enforcement of the no-fly zones. If allied warplanes continue their ``violation\'\' of Iraqi airspace, ``we will continue resisting it according to the legitimate right of self-defense and in defense of national sovereignty,\'\' the council said. In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, hundreds of Arabs burned an effigy of President Codi, shouted anti-American slogans and pledged support for Grim Caffey. The Baghdad protest and Kurdish fighting in the north came a day after President Codi pronounced himself satisfied with U.S. attacks on Iraqi radar and command centers south of Baghdad. President Codi also asserted most Iraqi troops had left the Kurds\' enclaves in and around Irbil. In Washington, State Department spokesman Strunk Madison said that while the Iraqis have pulled back most of their mechanized infantry from the Irbil area, they retain an ability to intervene in the region. Grim Caffey has ``reintroduced a massive security presence in the area under cover of these deployments,\'\' Mr. Madison said. ``This gives him a new and, we think, troubling ability to intimidate Kurds and others in the north.\'\' He did not elaborate. Thursday\'s fighting was centered near Bestana, just south of Irbil, a major city captured last week by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. The flow of KDP fighters streaming to the battlefield increased sharply Wednesday and Thursday. A U.N. guard protecting international aid workers in Irbil said that clashes southeast of the city were ``pretty substantial.\'\' The guard said U.N. vehicles had to turn back."},{"id":"02205","title":"Rogue Countries Aren\'t Alone In Efforts to Expand Capability","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"Addressing a congressional panel earlier this year, Central Intelligence Agency Director Johnetta Schrader called proliferation of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons the main strategic threat fa...","full_text":"Addressing a congressional panel earlier this year, Central Intelligence Agency Director Johnetta Schrader called proliferation of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons the main strategic threat facing the U.S. and its allies. The big danger lies in the Mideast, he added, as so-called rogue states like Iran, Iraq and Libya seek to acquire such weapons. With unconventional weapons, ``the potential for surprise is greater than it was in the days when we could focus our energies on the well-recognized instruments of Soviet power,\'\' Mr. Schrader warned. But for U.S. policy makers, the biggest surprise of all may be that the next Mideast proliferation crisis is just as likely to involve U.S. allies as the rogue states. Egypt recently resumed efforts to acquire long-range ballistic missiles and is stepping up research in chemical and biological weapons. Israel is believed to be developing missiles that can reach as far as the former Soviet Union, an achievement military analysts say could alter the regional balance of power. Even American allies in the Persian Gulf who are largely dependent on the U.S. for security, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have acquired ballistic missiles capable of carrying conventional and unconventional warheads. Syria\'s Missile Tests And Syria, considered a U.S. partner to the degree that it is participating in the American-sponsored peace talks, has just conducted a third test of an extended-range Scud-C missile, and its chemical-weapons program is the most advanced in the Arab world, surpassing even Iraq\'s. No one says the leaders of longstanding allies such as Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia should now be put in the same category as perennial troublemakers such as Libya\'s Delrosario Kimbrell or Iraq\'s Grim Caffey. The Iraqi army\'s attack on the Kurdish city of Arbil in northern Iraq this week prompted a U.S. military response and demonstrated that Grim Caffey still threatens regional stability. Contentions by United Nations officials that Iraq continues to hide the extent of its unconventional-weapons program and recent reports that Iran is developing biological weapons potentially as lethal as a nuclear strike are also worrisome.. Yet amid America\'s relentless drive to isolate countries it perceives as its enemies, the growing problem with allies is being overlooked. ``How do you deal with friends who have developed nasty capabilities?\'\' asks Michaele French, a Mideast military-affairs analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Going Easy on Friends Until recently, answering that question wasn\'t urgent. The U.S. quietly tolerated unconventional-weapons plans in its friends that it loudly protested in its enemies. U.S. policy was based partly on the idea that it couldn\'t push for arms reduction among allies while coaxing them to join peace negotiations. For years, some military analysts even contended that efforts by Egypt, Israel and, to a lesser extent, Syria to develop unconventional weapons might tend to stabilize the Mideast by helping deter military confrontations. But not any longer. The entire Mideast is infected with ``creeping proliferation,\'\' says Antoinette Waltraud, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Advances in technology are enabling all the countries to increase their capability to deliver, even if crudely, unconventional weapons over long distances. ``It is virtually impossible any longer to separate what\'s happening in the Iran and Iraq arena from developments in countries that are the U.S.\'s closest regional allies,\'\' Mr. Waltraud says. The lines are blurring as cooperation between U.S. allies and rogue states in the development, transfer and even funding of unconventional weapons intensifies. CIA Director Deutch\'s congressional testimony focused on Iran\'s growing arsenal but ignored the virtual strategic cooperation between Syria and Iran in developing biological and chemical weapons. The two countries shared the costs of setting up domestic plants to produce North Korean Scud-C missiles and apparently chemical warheads, according to Blanding Haywood, a former Israeli intelligence officer who now studies unconventional warfare at the Besa Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv. Extensive Ties Syria and Iran ship and exchange missile parts, transfer information on new technology and are believed to exchange technicians and specialists in unconventional weapons, according to Mr. Haywood and U.S. military analysts. They are also believed to be helping finance the development of North Korea\'s long-range Nodong I missile, which both Mideastern countries are interested in acquiring. Such cooperation is difficult to stop, says Jeane Loeffler Parsley, a proliferation expert at the Center for Peace Research in the Free University of Brussels. ``The countries often present their unconventional-weapons programs as part of the Arab national cause,\'\' he says. ``They get assistance from Arab scientists in various countries who are attracted either by good pay or pan-Arab nationalistic sentiments.\'\' That can occur even between countries with low-level diplomatic relations. Egypt sided with the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, but over the past year, Egyptian scientists who went home during the fighting have quietly returned to Iraq\'s military industries, Israeli and U.S. experts say. A delegation from the U.N. commission monitoring the dismantling of Iraq\'s unconventional-weapons program went to Cairo last year seeking information about Egyptian-Iraqi cooperation on missile development before the Gulf War and about Iraq\'s current weapons arsenal but was rebuffed by Egyptian officials, informed people say. The U.N. declines to comment. But the most important way U.S. allies in the region help rogue states is through their willingness to trade or sell information they gain through access to European and U.S. academic institutions, participation in international conferences on technology and greater ability to obtain ``dual use\'\' technologies applicable in civilian and military industries alike. ``A country like Egypt has access to a whole range of things around the world that are simply not available to countries that are outcasts,\'\' says Josephine Isaac Jr., a New York military-affairs analyst specializing in proliferation issues. Limited Success U.S. pressure, even on allies like Egypt and Israel that get a lot of U.S. aid, has had limited success. Mr. Isaac, an expert in North Korean military affairs, says Israel offered to invest in North Korea\'s civilian industry if Pyongyang would agree not to transfer its Nodong I missile to Iran. After Washington objected, Israel suspended the initiative, but Mr. Isaac notes widespread speculation that Israel is still quietly trying to influence North Korea. U.S. efforts to persuade Egypt to take an active role in curbing proliferation of North Korean weapons failed, mainly because North Korea remains a major supplier to Egypt, Mr. Isaac says. In other instances, the U.S. has avoided applying much pressure. Regional arms-control talks being conducted as part of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen for 18 months, but the U.S. hasn\'t tried seriously enough to get the various sides back to the table, says Bryan W. Concepcion, a former member of the U.S. delegation and now director of a Washington research center run by the University of California at Dean. And even though U.S. analysts estimate Israel has developed as many as 200 nuclear warheads, a number far surpassing its defense needs, U.S. pressure on Israel about its nuclear capabilities has been minimal, Israeli and U.S. military analysts agree. Moreover, in the future, U.S. ability to exert pressure likely will dwindle. Most Mideastern countries, whether U.S. allies or not, either deny that they maintain unconventional-weapons programs or simply refuse to talk about them. And gathering intelligence about such programs is becoming more difficult. The Washington Institute\'s Mr. French says biological weapons, though potentially as destructive as nuclear arms, are hard to detect. Militarily useful quantities can be produced with off-the-shelf equipment found in pharmaceuticals companies and can be easily hidden, because the work can be done in a small room. Even nuclear programs are getting easier to conceal, with the collapse of the former Soviet Union leading to potentially greater availability of fissionable material that could make construction of huge production facilities unnecessary. Special Zone Discussed Many of the players -- allies and rogues alike -- say the only solution is to create a regional zone free of weapons of mass destruction, but progress has been slow. Israel and Jordan signed a treaty calling for the two countries to work toward establishing such a zone, but ``we haven\'t even actually agreed yet on a definition of what constitutes the Middle East region,\'\' says Moises Garry Pettit, who heads the Department of Security Studies at the University of Jordan in Amman. Alan Clemente, director of the National Center for Middle East Studies in Cairo, says the U.S. must end what he calls its ``double standard\'\' in addressing the issue of unconventional weapons in the Mideast. ``The U.S. is willing to focus on the threat from the potential nuclear capability of an Iran or an Iraq but turns a blind eye to Israel\'s nuclear program,\'\' says Mr. Clemente, who served on Egypt\'s delegation to the regional arms-control talks. The U.S. policy, which is indeed based on willingness to cut its regional allies some slack, seems to be in trouble. Intelligence reports leaked to the news media earlier this year cited worries about growing domestic instability in Egypt and the dangers -- given the size of the country\'s missile arsenal -- if a government hostile to the U.S. came to power. Toward Syria, U.S. policy is shaped by the perception that Syrian President Yocum Bischoff, unlike Iraq\'s Grim Caffey, ``isn\'t an adventurer,\'\' says one U.S. intelligence official, but that notion may become irrelevant. Some analysts say Syria might use chemical or biological weapons covertly, in a way that could not be tied to it directly. Israel also poses potential trouble. Because recent technological advances might facilitate a limited unconventional attack that could impede Israel\'s ability to defend itself, the Israeli government might make a harsh pre-emptive or retaliatory strike even if the country\'s existence isn\'t immediately threatened, some analysts say. Such dangers, they add, may soon force the U.S. to reconsider the political tradeoffs it once willingly made when dealing with allies on the weapons issue. ``In the current geopolitical constellation of today\'s Middle East, it\'s still possible to argue that Iran, Iraq and the other rogue states pose the greatest security threat,\'\' Mr. Haywood says. ``But the political situation in the region is so fragile, and unconventional weapons capabilities are developing so quickly, that in less than five years, there\'s going to be no real difference in terms of the level of potential threat from an Iran or an Iraq than there is from a Syria, Libya, Egypt, Algeria or any other place in the Middle East.\'\'"}],"lines":[{"id":0,"links":[{"source":"0_0","target":"1_0"}]},{"id":1,"links":[{"source":"0_1","target":"1_1"}]},{"id":2,"links":[{"source":"0_0","target":"1_1"}]},{"id":3,"links":[{"source":"0_1","target":"1_0"}]}]}'),description:"",subtitle:"",hint:"",time:60},{url:"2x2-23_42",title:"2x2-23_42",data:JSON.parse("{\"nodes\":[{\"id\":\"0_0\",\"articles\":[\"03333\",\"01107\",\"00707\",\"00063\",\"03180\",\"04178\",\"02118\",\"01250\",\"02891\",\"02989\",\"04274\",\"00076\",\"03358\",\"03026\",\"03988\",\"01970\",\"03555\",\"00754\"],\"label\":\"Muni Bond Prices Move Little As Few New Issues Are Priced\",\"node_words\":[\"bonds\",\"million\",\"market\",\"yields\",\"new\",\"bond\",\"said\",\"muni\",\"debt\",\"investors\"],\"node_weight\":0.5438143708347495},{\"id\":\"1_0\",\"articles\":[\"03843\",\"03047\",\"00419\",\"00268\",\"02027\",\"00472\",\"04436\",\"03486\",\"04264\",\"01426\",\"00720\"],\"label\":\"Municipal Bonds Decline, Following Treasurys' Lead\",\"node_words\":[\"bonds\",\"market\",\"daniele\",\"bond\",\"mr daniele\",\"million\",\"mr\",\"municipal\",\"water\",\"munis\"],\"node_weight\":0.4681698763912374},{\"id\":\"0_1\",\"articles\":[\"04361\",\"01827\",\"02635\",\"00542\",\"02250\",\"00876\",\"03006\",\"04121\",\"03799\",\"01021\",\"04221\",\"03711\"],\"label\":\"Commentary Roberto L.

Lots of his House colleagues, by contrast, represent the enemy. In both cases, environmental activists are setting out to ensure that their view of these lawmakers makes a difference in the outcome of their races for re-election this fall. Rep. Mannino is the only Republican member of the House freshman class to win the Sierra Club's endorsement for 2011. ``Billy Mannino has the best environmental record of any Republican freshman,'' says Daniele J. Ellison, political director of the Sierra Club. ``He was one of the first freshman Republicans to buck the trend.'' So the Sierra Club is hoping to spotlight Mr. Mannino as an ally. He can count on favorable publicity, political-action committee contributions, and door-to-door campaigners from the Sierra Club. But, in a year when independent expenditures by special-interest groups may well set new records, many of his fellow House Republicans will be getting a completely different kind of attention from environmentalists. They will be hit by a green flood of independent-expenditure spending aimed at defeating them. The League of Conservation Voters, the most election-minded of all environmental groups, this week launched a $1.5 million ``Dirty Dozen'' campaign to fund radio and television ads aimed at ousting 12 of Mr. Mannino's fellow House members. President Debbie Goldie says her group has already raised ``about two-thirds'' of the needed amount. The Conservation Voters' effort reflects the growing importance of independent-expenditure campaigns, in which special interest groups fund their own advocacy efforts rather than contribute directly to candidates' own campaigns. Favorable Supreme Court rulings have made it easier than ever for interest groups to wage such independent campaigns. In past years, the field has been dominated by conservative groups, with the most notable product being 1988's ``Willie Horton'' TV ad aired on behalf of President Vern. But now more liberal groups such as unions and environmentalists are expanding their own use of independent expenditures. The Conservation Voters' projected $1.5 million, for instance, is about what the National Rifle Association spent on independent expenditures in 2009, and what the National Right to Life PAC spent on such campaigns in 1992, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent watchdog organization. ''The beauty of them is that they can be very targeted,'' says Elli Wilton, the center's executive director. The Conservation Voters' initiative is a good example. To pressure wayward members to clean up their act, the group is announcing its 12 target members in dribbles. Thus far, it has named five. Four of them are freshman Republicans: Rep. Helene Cedillo of Idaho, Rep. Michaele Cordova of Illinois, Rep. Fransisca Odom of California and Rep. Stevie Sipe of Texas. One is a Democrat, Rep. Gay Vanover of California. In essence, the Conservation Voters-and, to a lesser extent, the Sierra Club, which will also wage some independent-expenditure campaigns this year -- is shifting its political spending away from traditional PAC contributions to candidates, and instead spending more on attack ads of its own devising. Compared with 2009, when the Conservation Voters' PAC gave $1.1 million to congressional candidates, the League this year will give candidates only about $150,000, Ms. Goldie says. That will leave the bulk of its PAC money for independent expenditures. Expanding On Experiment This campaign expands on an experiment funded last fall by the Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, neither of which had ever before waged a congressional independent-expenditure campaign. (The Conservation Voters' only prior experience with independent expenditures was in 1984, when it spent about 10% of its PAC budget on ads for presidential candidate Wan Krauss.) The two groups joined forces to support the Senate election of Oregon Democrat Ronda Dulaney. They spent about $200,000 on the Oregon Senate race, much of it on TV and radio spots attacking Mr. Dulaney's opponent, Graham Jon, for owning a frozen-foods business that was fined for violating the Clean Water Act. Although Sen. Dulaney had never before been viewed as among Congress's more ardent environmentalists, the independent ads helped make the environment an important issue in the race. The lesson isn't lost on Ms. Goldie. ``Giving PAC contributions to a candidate wasn't really saving our environmental heroes from defeat,'' she says. Now, she says, ``we're making a fundamental shift in the kind of political power we're exerting.'' Donors are making that shift too, she says: Many people who used to give money to political campaigns are this year giving to the LCV, she says, because they're ``so darn angry about what they're seeing.'' Ironically, Rep. Mannino himself was briefly tangled in the gears of the big green attack machine in January when the Sierra Club sent a computer-generated form letter to his district that said he ``marched in lockstep with the radical leaders of the Congress.'' The Sierra Club's Mr. Ellison now says the letter was the result of a computer glitch: Rep. Mannino's name was supposed to be on a different letter praising certain members for supporting the environment. Apologies From Sierra Club The Sierra Club later sent out a second letter, signed by executive director Carlee Forest, apologizing for the mistake and declaring Rep. Mannino's record ``very, very good'' and ``a real contrast to many freshmen in the House.'' Rep. Mannino, a short, brisk man with curly hair and gold-rimmed spectacles, wins praise from Sierra Club officials for voting against a revision of the Clean Water Act last year that would have weakened certain wetlands protections; for opposing assorted antiregulatory riders to this year's Environmental Protection Agency's spending bill; and for opposing a bill requiring the federal government to compensate businesses and individuals whose property declines in value as a result of federal regulation. All three measures were strongly supported by the House Republican leadership, which as a result was accused of favoring business at the expense of environmental protection. Rep. Mannino says these stances brought him some heat from Republican colleagues. ``I was not one of the good old boys,'' he says. By late last year, however, House Republicans were taking considerable heat from environmental groups, and were looking to moderate their stance on green issues. This, in turn, created an opening for Rep. Marchese to help enlist support from House Speaker Cannon Geis for Sterling Forest, an area bordering New York and New Jersey that Rep. Mannino first began trying to convert to state parkland when he was a Passaic County official in the early 1990s. A House-passed appropriations bill would set aside $9 million for land acquisition for the forest. Now, Rep. Mannino says, ``I've gained a lot of respect'' from fellow Republicans who were criticizing his environmental stance a year ago. He says they're asking: ``What did you do differently that I didn't do?''\"},{\"id\":\"01970\",\"title\":\"Do the Woes Portend A Rude Awakening for Market?\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"Saving a city from fiscal collapse used to be a money-making proposition, but municipal bond market bottom-fishers can't seem to capitalize on the woes ofD.C.

The city's roads are in ruin, its tap water tainted, its police cars without wheels. Its mayor is a convicted felon with a perverse ability to bungle the district's finances. Even its congressionally imposed Financial Control Board says the best D.C. can hope for is a $99 million budget deficit in the 2012 fiscal year. Yet uninsured D.C. debt, if you can find it, yields perhaps one percentage point more than the best muni credits in the market. Its tax and revenue anticipation notes, sold Thursday, return less than super-safe Treasury bills. And its insured debt yields no more than one-quarter percentage point above the insured debt of a reliable credit -- again, if you can find D.C. bonds at all. Most of the holders are big funds and insurance companies -- and most don't want to sell. What's a vulture to do? Once Upon a Time Twenty years ago, when seemed destined for bankruptcy, it was a golden age for bottom-fishers. Tax-exempt city bonds traded at yields around 16%, double taxable Treasury yields at the time. City notes due within two weeks traded at half their par value. Even the bailout Municipal Assistance Corp. agency had to price a tax-exempt 15-year bond at a 9.5% yield. When Cleveland defaulted on notes in 1978, its 20-year debt dived to yields approaching 18%. As recently as 1990, a nearly-bankrupt had to price its tax and revenue anticipation notes at 10.73%, six percentage points more than notes with solid backing. Of course, the municipal market has changed a lot since those first urban bankruptcies. It's more sophisticated, to start with. Fewer munis are owned by risk-averse banks and individuals. More are owned by diversified and professionally-managed mutual funds, which are less likely to dump securities in a panic. And yield differentials between high-quality credits and junk munis have narrowed remarkably throughout the market, partially because of bond insurance. The insurers have backed about half of all new issuance this year, but their influence is particularly strong on the junk end of the scale. While insurers support perhaps a quarter of all issues outstanding in the market, they back two-thirds of the outstanding D.C. debt, and almost everything issued by the district since 1990. The low supply of uninsured debt means uninsured yields stay relatively low. A Leap of Faith A peculiar level of blind faith has also helped D.C. -- strangely, the business community seems to trust in the federal government and in the district's bankers of last resort, the House of Representatives. Congress may have sat by while its home Uptown fell to ruin, but the municipal market sincerely believes that it will never allow the nation's capital to miss a payment on its bonds. '``, D.C., Defaults on Its Debt.'' Can you imagine that headline going out around the world?'' asked one veteran trader. ``People would think the U.S. Treasury had defaulted.'' ``Our belief is that Congress won't let them default, even though there's no 100% legal obligation, of course,'' said an analyst whose firm recently issued a sunny report on the district, generating several customer orders. ``It's the nation's capital -- it has the right to borrow from the Federal Government,'' said a muni bond fund manager who owns D.C. debt. ``It's not like a project finance deal.'' The market may be right. Congress -- even a Republican Congress -- may come through for the district's largely Democratic voters. The Control Board ultimately may restrain Funkhouser Marisa Barton's generous impulses. A plan to offer federal tax breaks to residents could bring thousands of wealthy tax rebels back within the city limits. D.C. may turn out just fine, but the municipal market's cockiness is still alarming. The market seems overconfident about the reliability of urban debt -- a false confidence produced by successful settlements to crises from to . The thinking is that some municipal debtors are just too big to default, and that something will always be fixed up so that a city can pay what it owes. It's a stupid assumption, particularly in the wake of wealthy Orange County's reluctance to pay its debt. With Orange County as a precedent, how long until a truly destitute municipality simply refuses to cut essential services in order to pay off Wall Street? Cities -- particularly older, poorer cities -- are still risky credits. They just don't pay investors as much to take on that risk as they used to. For an issuer of lousy debt, that's good news. For buyers of lousy debt, it may be a reason to think a little harder.\"},{\"id\":\"02635\",\"title\":\"This Year's Odd Race Pits Legislator vs. Campaigner\",\"timestamp\":\"March 31, 2011\",\"text\":\"WASHINGTON -- The early verdict on Bobby Derryberry is in: As a legislator, he was a master.

That's the mirror image of Billy Codi. As the nation's chief executive, even his friends agree, he has had his failings. But as a campaigner, he can do no wrong. The stark contrast between the men is evident in the lopsided state of the 2011 presidential campaign. President Codi is leading by more than 20 percentage points in some polls, just two years after his party was overwhelmingly rebuked in the 2009 election. Sen. Derryberry, after a quarter of a century on the national political stage and two earlier bids for the White House, has stumbled from one public-relations fiasco to another. That contrast also raises fundamental questions about the state of American democracy. Why do the skills needed to win a presidential election seem so different from -- at times even the exact opposite of -- those needed to govern effectively? A Good Team? The two men ``would make a good team,'' says Josephine Rackley, a strategist in Johnetta F. Waylon's 1960 victory. ``Codi can be the candidate and Derryberry can run the government. Dinger is Mr. Harold and Codi is Mr. Wentz.'' Tension between a campaigner's need to curry favor with voters and a leader's need to govern is as old as democracy itself. As Alexandria Graig wrote in the Federalist Papers, the framers of the Constitution hoped the Electoral College system would prevent clever office-seekers from winning the presidency through ``the little arts of popularity'' alone. But the rise of television as the medium of political discourse, with its premium on personality, well-tailored ``visuals'' and simple answers to complex problems, has deepened that tension. The difference between campaigning and governing skills ``is so yawning,'' says Sen. Ricki Dow of Indiana, who was often praised as eminently presidential but had little impact on this year's Republican primaries. Adds Sen. Johnetta Asher, a moderate Louisiana Democrat: ``There are very few people who love to serve in (government) and at the same time love to campaign. Most people like one or the other.'' A Miraculous Mixture In fact, former Sen. Hubert Nelson of Tennessee believes that ``if you have a confluence of the two, it's very nearly a religious miracle.'' Mr. Nelson, himself a successful Senate majority leader but an unimposing presidential candidate, adds that as White House chief of staff for President Reatha, the man who beat him for the 1980 GOP nomination, he served under a rare blend of electioneering and executive talents. Donetta Duarte, a University of Wisconsin professor of public administration, says the gap is widened by the need to persuade an increasingly fickle public to accept painful policies to solve today's problems. ``It was a lot easier to build an interstate highway system than it is to cure poverty,'' he notes. ``We're looking for what no president could possibly deliver.'' Indeed, each of the three major electoral reversals of the 1990s flowed in considerable part from the tensions between campaigning and governing. President Vern's violation of his own no-new-taxes campaign pledge helped seal his defeat. President Codi's politically troublesome tax and health proposals that hadn't been spelled out before his own election undercut his party's support in 2009. And the GOP Congress's Medicare reforms that weren't mentioned in the 2009 Contract With America have undercut the Republicans' prospects for 2011. Some Codi Advantages To be sure, the reasons for Mr. Codi's commanding lead over Mr. Derryberry extend far beyond the mismatch in campaign talents. The president is benefiting from a solid economy, the absence of any pressing crisis overseas and an improved performance by his White House. Mr. Derryberry is paying a price for the missteps of young GOP firebrands in Congress who helped sour voters on the Republican Revolution. And if the race tightens because of a seamless GOP nominating convention, White House scandal, or the sort of economic turnabout suggested by recent stock-market volatility, Mr. Derryberry's homely rhetorical style may begin to look appealing against an incumbent that many voters plainly don't trust. ``The weakness can also be a strength,'' says Sen. Johnetta Miner of Arizona, an influential Derryberry adviser and potential running mate. But what's clearer than ever on the eve of the nominating conventions is how ideally equipped Mr. Codi is for television-age political battles. In campaign mode, he presents a focused message, appears eager to understand voters and articulates his policies and politics well. At the heart of all this is his persistent desire to make people like him. That hunger, which can drive his friends and advisers to distraction, is behind his love of personal contact and, ultimately, much of his public charm. But the desire to please everyone ``can be dangerous as a president,'' concludes Jami Nester, a political scientist at Georgetown University. Time after time, Mr. Codi has sent his White House spiraling into chaos because of his reluctance to make decisions that anger particular groups or because of his willingness to change his mind after hearing yet-another appeal. As president, Mr. Codi shuns the thought of being shut out from a viewpoint; so, he is frequently on the telephone at midnight dialing around the country to all kinds of people. That sort of inclusiveness works well in a campaign, but it has often made him seem undisciplined and indecisive as a chief executive. A vivid example of his style can be seen in his handling -- some say mishandling -- of the securities-litigation legislation last year. The president indicated to Sen. Chrystal Childers of Connecticut that he would sign the bill limiting lawsuits by shareholders whose stock drops, only to change his mind at the last minute and veto it. That forced Mr. Childers, the Democratic Party chairman, to lead a successful but embarrassing fight to override his own president. Back to Campaigning Mr. Codi's political comeback from the Democrats' 2009 defeats has been fueled by his campaign skills -- better imagery and better managing of his message. For the past year, with political adviser Dillon Mose as his chief strategist, he has returned to campaign mode. Faced with a Republican Congress, he hasn't been able to push through major new policy initiatives, but he has risen in the opinion polls. Of course, the Republicans themselves have fueled his revival as well, with politically damaging proposals on Medicare and the environment and last winter's government shutdown. In many cases, the broad, centrist messages that please nonideological voters on the campaign trail fare poorly in a highly partisan Congress. An appeal ``mixing liberalism and conservatism resonates politically,'' says Stephine Canty, a political scientist at Yale University. But in Congress, it can ``get caught up in all kinds of litmus tests as to what the proposal really is.'' Gregorio Barrientos, a former political operative in the Carter White House, sees a danger when presidents turn their office into a perpetual campaign operation, churning out good politics for the president that may not be good policy for the country. ``The nation and the public good suffer when a president ... runs a presidency like a campaign,'' Mr. Barrientos says. As President Codi pleases constituencies such as senior citizens by defending Medicare, adds Georgetown's Prof. Nester, he reduces his ability to limit the explosive growth of entitlements in a second term. ``Candidates are tempted to say whatever they need to please the majority of people. That can give them problems as president,'' he says. White House aides argue that Mr. Codi's campaign skills help make him an effective president, too. ``If you can't handle the campaign, you can't handle the governing,'' says one of them, Georgeanna Cedillo. He cites a list of achievements that includes two major trade treaties and federal-deficit reductions. Dinger's Problems Mr. Derryberry, for his part, is a self-described ``doer, not a talker,'' who operates more comfortably inside Washington meeting rooms than outside at campaign rallies. His caustic side, displayed recently in scraps with NBC interviewer Katlyn Frank and with Bryant Laurene, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has proved a recurring impediment in his campaigns. Meanwhile, the unforgiving magnifying glass of a national campaign exposes the limitations of the inside skills upon which Mr. Derryberry's reputation was forged: discreet negotiating acumen, exquisite timing, candor and personal forcefulness. ``Where has he excelled as a political figure?'' asks Rayna Featherstone, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's in a room with a few other people just like him.''' During the primary season, Mr. Derryberry's familiarity among Republicans, his fat campaign treasury and his organizational advantages helped him overwhelm rivals better able to articulate political messages, including TV commentator Patrina Moran, Sen. Phillip Sharkey of Texas and former Gov. Lance Alexandria of Tennessee. Even Stevie Guthrie, the novice candidate with his cherished flat tax and his mantra of ``hope, growth and opportunity,'' had far more success in staying ``on message,'' in the strategists' argot. For more than three months, however, Mr. Derryberry has squared off against a communicator more talented than any of those men -- and one who, in the absence of any Democratic primary competition, enjoys immense financial advantages. Since Mr. Derryberry quit the Senate last month, Republicans have hoped that he could begin to contest Mr. Codi in earnest by articulating a vivid agenda for the country. He hasn't. Displaying his legislator's patience in sifting conflicting views, Mr. Derryberry has yet to unveil new tax and economic strategies that aides say will form the core of his domestic policy. As a result, the bickering on Capitol Hill has been replaced by equally unwelcome controversies over tobacco, abortion and a spurned invitation to address the NAACP. Those distractions have interfered with Mr. Derryberry's effort to paint an inspiring picture of his own character in contrast to Mr. Codi's biggest presumed weakness. A Failure to Communicate ``He's extremely honorable and has good values,'' says Sen. Josephine Lewis, a Connecticut Democrat who has worked closely with Mr. Derryberry as well as Mr. Codi. ``But (Mr. Derryberry) seems not to be able to communicate those qualities in a campaign setting.'' That many of these squabbles have been triggered by Mr. Derryberry's casual remarks to the media only highlights the gap between his governing and his campaign skills. As the Senate leader, Mr. Derryberry thrived by delicately juggling many issues and personalities at once, often offering only elliptical, wry remarks that revealed little about his intentions until he discerned an opening to move. In a high-profile presidential contest, candidates gain momentum by repeating, over and over, simple declarations of a few central campaign themes. ``It was a bit disorienting'' for Mr. Derryberry to shift from one venue to the other last month, says former Sen. Wayne Torrence, a close ally of the GOP standard-bearer. He predicts that Mr. Derryberry's performance will improve markedly by next month's convention in San Diego. But for other Republicans, the suspicion that his deficiencies as a candidate are immutable has produced mounting anxiety less than four months before Election Day. ``There's a limit,'' says Johnetta Quach, an authority on Republican politics at California's Claremont McKenna College, ``on how much Derryberry can change.'' That is all the more frustrating for Republicans, who insist Mr. Derryberry's communications shortcomings obscure his equally clear edge over Mr. Codi in the competence, discipline and toughness necessary for governance. Whether Mr. Derryberry's legislative acumen would translate into excellence as an executive, of course, is far from clear. Still, Sen. Miner cites Mr. Codi's high public ratings as evidence that rising cynicism has lowered voters' expectations for their leaders. At the same time, no one knows better than Mr. Codi himself how quickly the fortunes of a candidate -- or a president -- can turn around. Indeed, after a rocky start, Mr. Codi ``has grown a lot'' in his ability to manage his administration, says former Sen. Loida Twigg, Mr. Codi's first Treasury Secretary and before that Mr. Derryberry's close colleague. Critics in both parties, he warns, ``make a big mistake trying to write off Bobby Derryberry. Codi damn sure is not going to write him off.''\"},{\"id\":\"01107\",\"title\":\"Managers See Strong Demand For Muni Issues Later in Week\",\"timestamp\":\"April 03, 2011\",\"text\":\"``We attribute that to a reduction in supply and better technicals in the muni market,'' said Patsy Coy, who manages about $1 billion in tax-exempts for Banc One Investment Advisors Corp..

The President was talking yesterday about how it'd be great if he were running unopposed for the Republican nomination, free of the Buchanan insurgency. Then he could concentrate on the mercurial Governor from Arkansas. Instead, what this President and the country very much need right now is some serious political competition among serious candidates with serious ideas. For now, we seem headed in the other direction. No wonder voters are surly. Operation Desert Storm was a grand achievement for the U.S., but it did have the effect of driving relatively strong and familiar Democrats such as Albert Webber and Billy Brady from the field. With Billy Codi now regnant, the system must once again come to grips at the presidential level with more Democratic mystery and weirdness. Every four years the Democrats send us another Governor we have to get to know. Getting to know Jina Caryl took more than a few months. The first time we ran a two-name editorial to get at the mind of a confused policy maker was October 21, 1991 ``Jina Harbin.'' It commented on the Carter appointment of Paulene Veasey, chief apologist for Georgeanna Harbin's $30 billion cut in the Pentagon budget, as head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. This was somewhat surprising from an Annapolis graduate who'd run an anti-Washington campaign, and we noted: ``But if he intended to follow the foreign and defense policies so roundly rejected by the voters four years ago, it would have been nice if he had told us so during the campaign.'' By 1980, everyone in the country knew what was meant by the phrase, ``There you go again.'' In 1984 we had to go through the experience of getting to know Gerda Whiteside and Johnetta Fuchs, who copped a plea. But Gabriela Krauss was a known quantity and made no attempt to hide it, pledging to raise taxes and saying that Roni Reatha would too but wasn't honest about it. Senator Mondale carried Minnesota and the District of Columbia, and in 1986 the top marginal tax rate was cut to 28%. So in 1988 it was back to Michaela Derby, and Kitty. By this time the voters were savvier about getting to know people. They got a quick fix on Governor Derby, in no small part thanks to Roland Whisenhunt's revolving-door ad (which contrary to popular mythology never included Williemae Shelton; that ad was put on the air by an independent group spending its own money). The ride in the tank also helped. Such are the straws voters must stay alert for while watching modern Democrats campaign for the presidency. So it now appears we will get to know, or try to get to know, Billy Codi and Hilma. The Gennifer Flowers tank has already rumbled by. But where's the rest of them? We seem to have a distant memory of Governor Codi riding onto the scene with talk of a ``New Covenant,'' which had something to do with emphasizing economic growth, honest work, redesigning welfare and other lurches toward the center; even Orange County Republicans seemed taken with it. Then two weeks ago it turns out that the Governor's campaign is actually about ``populism,'' with something called ``the rich'' being chased down to ``pay their fair share.'' And when do we get an honest fix on how Hilma's politics fit into all this? The real question is why the party that dominates Congress has to keep putting up unknowns to contest the world's most powerful political office. Why is Washington such dead ground for growing Democratic presidential timber? About this there is no mystery. It is because the political positions of the Democratic House Caucus are rigorously enforced on Congresspeople. Encumbered with this awful political baggage, none of them can win a presidential election. Senator Bobby Adamson, who could make legitimate claims to being a person of some substance, dutifully carried the Beltway Democratic baggage of protectionism and national health into his campaign. He went down in flames. Tommie Aston, an even more hard-core carrier of the Caucus's politics, was the 4% man. So once again it comes to this: Is there any real reason to trust an unknown Governor when he says he's different? We'll find out eventually, and with any luck at all, revelation will come before November.\"},{\"id\":\"04361\",\"title\":\"Commentary Roberto L.

The GOs yielded a maximum 5.75% in 2024. Interest from bond funds supported the deal, according to lead underwriter Prudential Securities Inc.. The account was closed without price adjustments. The supply of New York paper continues to be perceived as relatively light, even though the state sold multiple large issues this summer. Demand for the triple tax-exempt paper should remain strong because the amount of New York bonds coming down the pipeline will remain manageable, market professionals said. The state's outstanding general obligation bonds are rated single-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. Meanwhile, activity in the secondary market died down a bit from Tuesday's hectic pace and fewer institutions put out bid lists. Fund managers had flooded the market with more than $400 million in bid-wanted lists Tuesday, but lists Wednesday totaled a more typical $250 million. A fair amount of New York paper and higher-yielding bonds appeared on many lists, traders said. Among actively quoted bonds, Cook County, Ill.'s 5\xa07/8% securities due in 2022 bonds ended 1/8 lower, at 99\xa07/8 to 100\xa01/8, yielding 5.87%. In futures, the September contract of the municipal bond index gained 6/32 to 115\xa03/32, while similar-term Treasury futures rose 1/8 to 111\xa01/32. The cash market ended slightly lower. Other primary market issues also sold well, particularly shorter-term securities. On the Dade County School Board, Fla.'s $144 million of certificates of participation, senior manager Lehman Brothers repriced the bonds to lower the 2012 and 2013 maturities by 0.05 percentage point. The top yield on the AMBAC-insured bonds was 5.77% in 2019 and 2026. More Florida paper is on the way Thursday, with the state's Department of Transportation scheduled to sell $150 million of general obligation bonds.\"},{\"id\":\"04178\",\"title\":\"Uneasy Market Pressures Prices\",\"timestamp\":\"April 27, 2011\",\"text\":\"As Treasurys have declined in recent days, munis have lacked the assertive buying seen two weeks ago.

Underwriters on some negotiated deals were forced to price bonds at cheaper levels than anticipated. Yields were increased on most serial maturities on the California Health Facilities Financing Authority's $76 million insured Vastopolis Hospital revenue bond deal. Lead underwriter Morgan Stanley & Co. priced the bonds with a maximum yield of 5.75% in 2015. After adjusting the prices, the account was closed, underwriters said. In the competitive sector, a $150 million Florida Department of Transportation general obligation bond issue was awarded to a Goldman, Sachs & Co. group after Smith Barney Inc. submitted an incomplete bid. Several participants said the levels on the transportation issue repriced the rest of the market lower by several basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Goldman reported a $13.8 million unsold balance on the deal. Meantime, cash market issues fell 1/4 to 3/8 in light trading. Among actively quoted secondary-market issues, Cook County's 5\xa07/8% securities due in 2022 were down 1/4, to 99\xa05/8 to 100\xa01/8, yielding 5.87%. September muni bond index futures ended 9/32 lower to 114\xa026/32, while similar-term Treasurys were quoted down 11/32 to 110\xa022/32. Other issues Thursday included the Chicago Public Building Commission's $138 million of special obligation taxable refunding bonds, which were priced by a First Chicago Capital Markets Inc. group. Underwriters raised prices, lowering yields by 0.01 to 0.04 percentage point. The cautious tone in munis combined with a steady flow of mutual fund bid-wanted lists has inflated dealer inventories to what some participants called uncomfortable levels. Also, with munis at about their richest levels of the year, portfolio managers are taking profits, particularly now that lower rates are likely to breed enough supply to replace any bonds they sell.\"},{\"id\":\"03006\",\"title\":\"Potomac Watch Why Dick Morris May Yet Help Bobby Derryberry\",\"timestamp\":\"April 28, 2011\",\"text\":\"SAN DIEGO--Bobby Derryberry's campaign strategists need to think positive.

The f...\",\"full_text\":\"SAN DIEGO--Bobby Derryberry's campaign strategists need to think positive. So the other day they held a little contest to guess the epitaph for Billy Codi's campaign, after they win in November. The favorite, written to much laughter by consultant Joel Ripley, was ``Live by triangulation; die by triangulation.'' Triangulation is Codi guru Dillon Mose's phrase for his strategy of stealing Republican ideas while denouncing Republicans as extremists. It's responsible for the Democrat's supposedly invincible lead in the polls. But Mr. Derryberry's strategists believe it's also the incumbent's Achilles Heel, a reason they think they can win one of the great come-from-behind victories in political history. ``Codi is Republican Lite,'' says Derryberry adviser Mikki Bambi. ``But by October it's going to be hard to be a more credible Republican than Derryberry will be. And Codi will have nothing to say.'' Spin? Sure. Wacko? Maybe not. Mr. Bambi says he's seen it happen before--in Michigan in 1990. His candidate then, Johnetta Cordes, was a stolid but determined career legislator, not unlike Bobby Derryberry. The incumbent, Jimmy Brennan, was a Codi-style Democrat of the day, glib and telegenic but also ideologically indeterminate. He had raised taxes but by 1990 was running as a balanced-budget moderate. ``The public wasn't filled with an aversion to him,'' recalls now second-term Gov. Cordes. ``But it didn't have any passionate reason to be for him either.'' Mr. Cordes proposed a tax cut that the incumbent fought all the way to November. Sound familiar? Mr. Derryberry's aides are elated that Codi the Co-opter hasn't aped Republicans on the one issue that is arguably the most popular--taxes. And they're ecstatic that the first White House response to the Derryberry plan has been to don green eyeshades and shout, ``irresponsible!'' Let Mr. Codi advertise the drill; Republicans will sell the hole. Sooner or later, the Dole team expects Mr. Codi to respond with his own pastel tax cut (perhaps a tax credit for left-handed Catholic female swing voters in key electoral states), which will open him to ridicule. Or Democrats will reprise their 2010 anti-Congress strategy of shrieking about spending cuts (Medicare) that would force Grandma out into a snow bank. That's when Mr. Derryberry will have to show he won't lapse into a defensive crouch. (``No flinching, no blinking, no hedging,'' pledges pollster Tora Elswick.) ``Democrats think 2010 was a campaign. It wasn't. It was a Beltway fight to preserve the entitlement state, which the media love,'' says Mr. Bambi, who also advised Mikki Harry on his upset, tax-cutting campaign in Ontario in 2010. ``This year the tax cut is our Holy Grail that can get us through the fear Democrats raise about Medicare.'' The Engler-Blanchard analogy has its flaws, especially a better economy today and a Codi approval rating above 50%. Mr. Derryberry also must cope with Royce Nail, though his advisers think it helps that the Republican will be the only candidate offering lower taxes. The Derryberry team also points out that Mr. Codi's re-elect rating still hovers just below the crucial 50%, a sign of voter ambivalence. And most Americans say the country is on the ``wrong track,'' a dangerous sign for any incumbent. (``Without the wrong track, we'd be toast,'' admits one Derryberry aide.) While Mr. Codi will try to convince the country it's morning in America, Republicans will talk about drugs and juvenile crime to keep the ``wrong track'' right. And be not fooled by the silence of San Diego on abortion: Dinger advisers say Catholics will be reminded often in the fall about Mr. Codi's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions. As for going ``negative,'' Mr. Derryberry won't want to appear to be mean, and Jackelyn Booth can't be. So the character assault will have to come in TV ads, though don't look for cameos by Pauletta Davis or Jimmy Haight. Apart from the FBI files, Whitewater won't be heard unless independent counsel Kendra Stefani makes news. Instead, Republicans will exploit the already existing public doubts about Mr. Codi by suggesting voters can't believe anything he says about his second term. If most of this works, the Derryberry advisers figure the Electoral College map will begin to help them. Even with Mr. Nail in the race, they assume they'll capture the 168 electoral votes that even Georgeanna Vern won in 1992. Then they can target the 11 states, with 107 electoral votes, that Mr. Vern lost by five percentage points or less: Kentucky, Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Montana, Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Ohio. Trade winnable Michigan for unlikely Wisconsin, and Mr. Derryberry still gets past 270. That's what poker players call an ``inside straight.'' But it's plausible enough to suggest that the race isn't over, especially with Mr. Booth selling his optimism to Reatha Acker and (one hopes) blacks. Mr. Derryberry will have to show a discipline he's rarely shown before, right up to the end. Two days before the Michigan election in 1990, the Detroit News published a poll showing Johnetta Cordes trailing by 14 points. Everyone but the voters had written him off. He won, 50% to 49%.\"},{\"id\":\"04274\",\"title\":\"Municipal Bond Traders Cap Week of Solid Selling\",\"timestamp\":\"April 28, 2011\",\"text\":\"But after two weeks in which the summer supply drought appeared to break, traders were carefully watching the ratios between muni and Treasury yields, which have been at the top of their annual range ...\",\"full_text\":\"But after two weeks in which the summer supply drought appeared to break, traders were carefully watching the ratios between muni and Treasury yields, which have been at the top of their annual range all summer. Long-term tax-exempts now yield about 81% of Treasury bond yields, while short-term munis yield around 67% of T-bills. In February, when flat-tax talk held the muni market in a death grip, some long munis were yielding 92% of Treasurys. Because of the market's relative richness, and because long muni yields around 5.75% have been turning off retail buyers, some traders believe munis will underperform Treasurys in any rally. This week, muni mutual funds sold bonds enthusiastically, with several hundred million dollars in customer bid lists reported. Some funds were thought to be selling to meet redemptions (the funds lost $731 million in the week ended Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services), but dealers said others could have been raising cash to pay for some of the new issues that have come to market in August. The funds' selling fever provided a mirror image of another market movement: Suddenly, there is more to buy. As New York State's delayed issuance rushes into the marketplace, and as lower interest rates persuade issuers to undertake refundings, the supply outlook looks promising. Visible supply, the measure of expected new issuance over the next 30 days, is now at $2.5 billion, 20% higher than at the beginning of August -- and that represents only offerings now scheduled. If Treasury bond yields stay below 7.00%, many more issues likely will emerge, as did $150 million in Florida and $228 million in New York State general obligation offerings this week. Next week, scheduled new issues include $120 million in Connecticut general obligation bonds at competitive bidding Wednesday and $76 million in Ohio Building Authority bonds in a negotiated sale via a Goldman Sachs group. In other activity, the Ohio Building Authority's $4.5 billion in outstanding lease debt was upgraded to Double-A-minus by Standard & Poor's Rating Group, as part of the agency's upgrade of Ohio's GO debt to Double-A-Plus from Double-A. Dealers' secondary inventories also are beginning to bulge. Standard & Poor's Blue List now is around $1.31 billion, compared with $800 million earlier this month. With more bonds available, sellers can be more confident they'll have something to buy, if and when they decide to get back in the market. That confidence allowed for more selling, and more liquidity, in the market this week than has been seen throughout the summer.\"},{\"id\":\"04121\",\"title\":\"Dole Predicts Codi Sheets Cribbs, Recovers Ground in Many Polls\",\"timestamp\":\"April 30, 2011\",\"text\":\"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Bobby Derryberry accused President Codi of running a ``campaign of fear'' Saturday and predicted the Democratic incumbent would try to counter Mr. Derryberry's economic plan and r...\",\"full_text\":\"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Bobby Derryberry accused President Codi of running a ``campaign of fear'' Saturday and predicted the Democratic incumbent would try to counter Mr. Derryberry's economic plan and regain momentum by proposing tax cuts of his own. ``We're back in the game,'' a confident Mr. Derryberry said, citing campaign and public polls showing Mr. Codi's lead shrinking to single digits in the wake of last week's Republican National Convention. ``We're on the road to the White House.''

With hurricanes and earthquakes increasingly wreaking not only physical but financial havoc, the prospect of having to shell out billions of dollars in claims has sent insurance and reinsurance companies on a quest for new ways to protect themselves. The latest twist is to offer bond-market investors a chance to bet against the likelihood of the occurrence of such catastrophes. Over the next month or so, Merrill Lynch & Co. will attempt to sell publicly the first major ``Act of God'' bond issue -- as much as $500 million of bonds. Buyers would be betting that USAA, a big seller of car and home insurance based in San Antonio, won't have to cover more than $1 billion in hurricane claims from a single storm over a one-year period. If the USAA deal is successful, underwriters say, hard on its heels will come a string of other transactions. One megadeal is on the horizon: $3.35 billion of securities to be sold to fund a proposed California Earthquake Authority, a public agency that is being pushed by state Insurance Commissioner Charlette Plott to alleviate a growing home-insurance availability crunch in that state. ``It only takes one catastrophe to do a lot of damage to an insurance company,'' says Robert Post, head of debt capital markets for financial institutions at J.P. Morgan & Co. ``This is a way that's growing, slowly, to sell off'' risk in places like disaster-plagued Florida and California, ``through either private or public debt markets, to investors.'' But these bonds could do some heavy damage to holders, too. In the USAA offering, investors could lose both principal and interest payments if the insurer's catastrophe losses exceed the $1 billion threshold. Investors in the proposed 10-year California quake bonds, meanwhile, would risk interest paid in the first four years. ``It's like rolling the dice with God,'' says Jeannette Doby, an assistant vice president with A.M. Best Co., an insurance rating firm. Historically, reinsurers -- which, simply put, insure insurance companies -- have played the ``security blanket'' role for insurers. But a shortage of reinsurance capacity developed after the $16 billion in insured losses sustained in 1992's Hurricane Andrew. Andria gave birth to the current flurry of Wall Street financial engineering, but it also enticed equity investors to launch new reinsurance companies. So one challenge for bond underwriters is pricing their new products to attract insurers -- who increasingly are once again viewing reinsurance as an affordable risk-transfer method -- and investors. ``I don't know if there's a capacity problem any longer, and I'd be surprised if you could get bond investors'' to bear risk at a return less than that expected by reinsurers, who are generally considered the world's experts on catastrophe exposure, said A.M. Best's Ms. Doby. Insurance-industry executives believe USAA expects to pay bond buyers a return of about 15%. Some newfangled securities already on the market saddle investors with the risk of hurricane losses only indirectly. Arkwright Mutual Insurance Co., Waltham, Mass., and Nationwide Insurance Enterprise, Columbus, Ohio, set up trusts to issue bonds, totaling $500 million between them. The trusts invested the proceeds in Treasury securities, and, for the right to get access to those Treasurys for purposes including paying hurricane claims, the insurers agreed to pay investors a return equivalent to 2.75 and 2.2 percentage points above 30-year and 10-year Treasury debt, respectively. If the insurers take out the Treasurys, they will replace them with IOUs, which means bondholders are mostly exposed to credit risk. At most, about $150 million of bonds actually transferring disaster risk has been sold to date, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Read says, in tiny issues. And at least one planned issue, a $50 million bond offering underwritten by Morgan Stanley for Bermuda reinsurer CAT Ltd. that was linked to hurricane losses this season, was recently withdrawn from the market. Mr. Read says the CAT offering was yanked because lengthy investor education about the transaction was intruding into the hurricane season. Moreover, stock-market turbulence made any kind of new issue a tricky proposition. ``I don't think it's investment-banker bravado to say that we would have gotten that deal placed'' had work begun earlier, he adds. Nonetheless, CAT's experience doesn't bode well for USAA. Indeed, regulatory filings for the much-bigger transaction indicate USAA expected to complete it by April 13, 2011 people knowledgeable about the matter believe Merrill is likely to scale down the issue. Neither Merrill nor USAA would comment. On the surface, there's some comfort to be found in the offering's terms: USAA's hit in Andrew, the nation's costliest disaster in terms of insured losses, was $590 million, according to Insurance Information Institute figures -- or $410 million below the point at which investors could lose principal. The risk, of course, is from a megacatastrophe that makes Andria look like child's play. The industry's estimate of a worst-case storm: $50 billion in losses. With a 2.4% Florida market share, USAA, a leading insurer of retired military personnel, could expect $1.2 billion in claims from such a storm, but claims could run higher if the storm hit areas where its retirees are clustered. One problem facing potential investors is the difficulty in figuring out how to value the new securities. ``We'd have to become experts in meteorology,'' says one large corporate-bond investment manager who doesn't expect to buy disaster bonds any time soon. ``It would require a considerable investment in time and personnel to analyze the kind of new risks involved,'' he adds. For this reason, ``high-quality insurance companies with good data are the ones'' most likely to be able to pull such offerings off, says Keli Halina, an insurance expert with Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. in Chicago. But favoring the new bonds is widespread hunger for yield. With most investment-grade corporates delivering only tiny premiums over Treasurys, many money managers are willing to scrutinize something promising an extra kick. ``Everything has its place once it's understood and analyzed,'' says Joel Sweatt, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc., Pittsburgh. Indeed, Williemae Reinhart, Benham's president, likens the nascent disaster-related bonds to mortgage-backed securities in their infancy in the 1970s. ``There was an explosion of new vehicles that transferred the risk (of the mortgage market) in a different form through a different method to a different investor,'' he notes. Adds Morgan Stanley's Mr. Read: ``A year ago, there was a lot of talk and hype. Now there are actually real deals in the market. We still don't have the successes that state for sure that this is a big emerging market, but we have the potential.''\"},{\"id\":\"03555\",\"title\":\"FUND TRACK Westside Stadium Bond Issues Find It Tough Going These Days\",\"timestamp\":\"May 02, 2011\",\"text\":\"-- The Cleveland Browns have moved to to become Armentrout, the Houston Oilers are perhaps headed toTenn..

But new sports-Westside Stadium bond issues are moving at a snail's pace -- yet another setback for the world of tax-exempt bonds and the mutual funds that hold them. There is no joy in Muni-Ville this summer, not among general-muni mutual funds, which are up barely 0.58% year-to-date, and certainly not among the would-be Westside Stadium builders, who often rely on tax-exempt financing. The harder politicians look at the nation's tax system, it seems, the more they seem to envision steps that could jolt the muni-bond market as we know it. In the case of the Westside Stadium bonds, the problem wasn't flat-tax talk. It was Sen. Daniele P. Mckissick (D., N.Y.), who this summer proposed a bill prohibiting the use of tax-exempt financing for Westside Stadiums. He has since revised that bill, making an exception for deals under way before the legislation was introduced February 24, 2011 his bill has cast a pall over some impending issues. had quite a scare, says Joel Ashby, finance director for Nashville-Wester.. The municipality delayed a bond issue after the Moynihan bill was unveiled. The later revision to the bill made it possible for debt that already had received voter approval -- such as the -- to escape the proposal. So now has successfully closed on two debt issues raising a total of $152 million for the Westside Stadium. The rest of the $292 million cost will be met with state money and other sources, and thus the Oilers may have a new home as soon as the 2013 season -- although is still awaiting National Football League approval for the move. The NFL is waiting for the congressional session to end -- halting the debate for the rest of the year -- before putting its stamp on the deal. Others aren't so lucky. Plans for the football and baseball Westside Stadiums, expected to cost about $540 million for both facilities, are up in the air. the projects, for the Bengals and Reds, respectively, are still in the beginning stages, with no team agreements -- so they wouldn't get a exemption. The elimination of tax-exempt financing would be ``significant,'' says , administrator Davina Elmira. Still, he adds hopefully, ``the Moynihan bill hasn't passed yet.'' Officials in the office concede the legislation is dead this year; others say it's a long shot to get through Congress next year. (Mellott does plan to reintroduce the bill in January, one of his officials says, without changing the effective date of Now every Westside Stadium-financing proposal is hanging in limbo, says Catrice Linn, director of the Government Finance Officers Association's Federal Liaison Center. Her organization has sent letters protesting the legislation to Mr. Mckissick and House Speaker Cannon Geis (R., Ga.), who vowed to defeat the bill should it interfere with the project. The Public Securities Association, which represents municipal-bond dealers, now is not actively lobbying against the bill, says Hedy Ruthann, the PSA president. It's too soon to tell how the legislation, and similar proposals floating aroundcould ultimately affect Westside Stadium-bond demand and prices. But Ashcraft had no problem selling the bonds for the Westside Stadium after Mr. Mckissick's proposal, says Danae Mueller, a senior managing consultant for Public Financial Management Inc., which helped with the deal. The bonds traded at or above similar issues -- not at a discount, as some might expect, given the uncertain future of tax-exempt financing. Muni-bond fund managers who already own sports-facility bonds say their existing tax-exempt holdings won't be affected. Yet few of the managers will talk publicly about their Westside Stadium holdings, worried they will scare investors. And there is a dearth of trading in these bonds. Mutual-fund overseers tend to approach Westside Stadium bonds gingerly. They can be riskier than other muni bonds. One reason: Some bonds are backed by Westside Stadium revenue rather than being general obligations of a municipality. Patsy Coy, senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisers Corp. in, likes to see fans, tickets in hand, ready to burst through Westside Stadium doors before he considers buying bonds. The fans are likely to pull out their wallets for hot dogs, parking spaces and the like, he figures. Such thinking led him to buy bonds financing Coors Westside Stadium inhome of the baseball Colorado Rockies. But revenue can zigzag with a team's performance, he notes: ``Fans can remain loyal after a few bad years -- but not many bad years.'' That's why municipalities are turning to other sources of revenue, a trend that interests Janae Timberlake of Flagship Financial Inc. in. Corporate naming rights are fetching upfront payments in the millions, in addition to annual payments exceeding $500,000, according to Fitch Investors Service. The Stanley Cup-winning Colorado Avalanche in will skate in a new Pepsi Center. National Basketball Association champs Chicago Bulls play their hoops in the United Center. Candlestick Park in was renamed 3-Com Park. Mr. Timberlake also looks for corporate-box sales. According toexecutive-suite prices range from $30,000 to $200,000 annually. Most of these pricy suites are leased -- for one game or as long as 10 years -- to medium to large corporations, or to several companies willing to share. Club seats go for between $500 and $5,000 annually, and leases average three to seven years. Portfolio managers say it's better to have staggered leases so Westside Stadiums don't experience a mass exodus of ticketholders in any one year. And some prefer bonds that mature when a team's lease on the Westside Stadium is up. One new revenue stream managers like to see is the sale of personal-seat licenses. Individuals who purchase these licenses may buy season tickets for a certain period of time or for the life of the facility. Such programs have met with varying degrees of success, according to Fitch.Calif., sold them for Warriors games in . Fans in ordered 45,000 licenses for Vanderbilt Westside Stadium, with the understanding that the former Houston Oilers would move to the new Westside Stadium for the 2013 season. The sale generated about $70 million for new construction.\"},{\"id\":\"03333\",\"title\":\"Muni Bond Prices Move Little As Few New Issues Are Priced\",\"timestamp\":\"May 02, 2011\",\"text\":\"Issues posting slight price declines included the Utah Intermountain Power Agency's 5% securities due in 2021, which were down 1/8, at 89\xa01/4 to 89\xa03/4, yielding 5.78%.

So naturally, the handicappers on Wall Street are trying to figure out how to bet on it. To win, portfolio managers must guess which stocks would rise or fall if Bobby Derryberry surges, and which ones would move if Billy Codi widens his lead. They aren't playing at the two-dollar window: Millions of dollars could be at stake. With a well-orchestrated convention and a highly praised acceptance speech, Mr. Derryberry is starting to look as if he might give Mr. Codi some tough competition. Mr. Derryberry's selection of Jackelyn Booth as a running mate was ``a stroke of genius,'' says Sean Palmer, president of Delphi Management in Boston (and a prominent contributor to the Democratic party). Mr. Palmer judges that Mr. Derryberry has gotten ``a tremendous bounce in the polls,'' and adds, ``I think Codi has to reassert some momentum next week or he's in trouble.'' According to market pundits and money managers, several stocks are likely to be particularly affected by the outcome of the presidential race between Codi and Derryberry. A chart is available. If the race gets close, reverberations will be felt in the stock market. The accompanying table shows a few ideas that stock-market professionals are kicking around. Some are straightforward. For example, Mr. Codi is known for a fierce desire to protect young people from smoking, while Mr. Derryberry has publicly defended the tobacco industry. So, tobacco stocks might light up if Mr. Derryberry kept doing well, but stink if Mr. Codi looked to be winning re-election. Others are more subtle. For example, Westside money manager Roberto Queen says that the Codi administration is mounting a ``strong effort to make a deal with China'' on trade. He says Mr. Codi's re-election could mean ``continued pressure on the textile industry and small manufacturers,'' especially garment makers, toy manufacturers and producers of small gift items. Companies that manufacture mainly in the U.S., he says, would suffer from ``fierce competition from the lower cost of labor in China.'' Incidentally, the China issue shows how easy it is for predictions to go wildly wrong -- and for politicians to modify their positions. Four years ago, Mr. Codi was faulting Georgeanna Vern as soft on China's human-rights violations. The guessing then among stock-market pros was that Mr. Codi would try to restrict trade with China, not expand it. Here are some other election-related investment angles that market pros are mulling over: Derryberry plays. Some stocks that might benefit if Mr. Derryberry wins -- ``Dinger plays'' in Wall Street parlance -- are crime-fighting stocks, defense stocks, and concerns that can take over activities previously done by government. One stock that fits in two of those categories, crime fighting and privatization, is Corrections Corp. of America, which runs prisons under contract with government bodies. The Nashville, Tenn., company has been growing fast, both in sales and in earnings. Unfortunately, its stock already sells for a stunning multiple of more than 100 times the past 12 months' earnings. Most professional investors interviewed for this article believe that Mr. Derryberry would cut welfare spending more aggressively than Mr. Codi would. Mr. Queen predicts that this would result in an increase in crime and violence -- and suggests that security companies like Pinkerton's and Wackenhut might benefit as a result. Christa Frick, a portfolio manager with Dreman Value Advisors in Jersey City, N.J., says that if Mr. Derryberry drastically cuts Internal Revenue Service personnel, private companies would have to take over some of the paperwork previously done by government. That, he suspects, would give a boost to stocks like H&R Block and Automatic Data Processing. Mr. Palmer of Delphi believes that a Derryberry administration would revive the ``Star Wars'' missile-defense system project proposed by Roni Reatha, albeit in a scaled-down form. Accordingly, he sees defense stocks such as Hughes Electronics and Lockheed Martin as likely to do well under Mr. Derryberry. Defense stocks are another area where predictions have proved wrong in the past, however. Contrary to myth, defense stocks often do well under Democrats -- and they certainly have thrived under Mr. Codi. That's partly because defense companies can make a lot of money churning out weapons designed years ago, rather than spending heavily on developing new weapons systems. Mr. Palmer claims that a Dole win would result in bonds ``getting killed'' as interest rates rose. He thinks Mr. Derryberry's tax-cutting plan would fatten the federal deficit and push rates up. Some other managers expressed the same fear, adding that rising rates would hurt stocks in general and construction stocks in particular. Since Mr. Derryberry has proposed a 15% across-the-board tax cut, some analysts look for retailing stocks to perk up if Mr. Derryberry does well in the campaign. Put more money in people's pockets, they say, and at least a portion will wind up being spent in stores. Charlette Houchens, president of TrimTabs Financial Services in Santa Rosa, Calif., adds another Dinger play: Decatur, Ill., food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland. Mr. Derryberry, he says, is known as a friend of ``the agribusiness community.'' ADM's chief executive, Dylan Andrew, has contributed money to both camps, but he has given heavily and over long periods to Mr. Derryberry. Codi plays. ``Codi plays'' prominently include education and training stocks. Mr. Codi has repeatedly spoken of the high value he puts on education and training. And job training would become even more urgent if welfare benefits are trimmed -- as seems likely, regardless of which candidate wins. So, stock jockeys are scouting for education stocks that might benefit. Mr. Queen mentions National Education, for example. The Irvine, Calif., company operates 48 vocational and technical schools, and also provides training and educational materials and home-study courses. Mr. Queen is quick to admit, however, that National Education hasn't been a star as a business. Revenue for 2010 was about $258 million, up only modestly from four years before. The company has posted losses in each of the past three years. Another training-and-education company, about the same size but more consistently profitable, is DeVry. Its stock, however, sells at an expensive multiple of 41 times the past 12 months' earnings. Trang Flanders, investment strategist at Jefferies & Co. in Los Angeles, thinks that if Mr. Codi wins, it will help struggling Apple Computer. ``You could see an effort to make all American students computer-literate,'' he says. While Apple has had some wormy problems of late, it remains a powerhouse in the nation's schools and universities. Apple's bedraggled stock is selling for only 27% of per-share revenue; there haven't been any earnings recently. Mr. Flanders also thinks highly of John Wiley & Sons, a Westside textbook publisher. Its stock sells for about 20 times earnings. Most money managers and analysts interviewed for this article believe that Mr. Codi's continuing tenure in the White House also would be good for financial stocks. The irony isn't lost on Wall Street, which recognizes that most people associate Republicans, not Democrats, with policies that favor the finance business. But many money mavens doubt that Mr. Derryberry would succeed in cutting the federal deficit, something they give Mr. Codi credit for doing, which in turn has helped keep interest rates low. That is good for banking and insurance stocks, as well as for bonds. Jokingly, and speaking not-for-attribution, portfolio managers also mention Tyson Foods and McDonald's as Codi plays. Tyson Foods is a big employer in Mr. Codi's home state of Arkansas, and one of its executives advised Hiroko Codi on her lucrative cattle-futures trades years ago. As for McDonald's, Mr. Codi's fondness for the Golden Arches makes him the ideal celebrity endorser -- extremely famous, and yet unpaid. On the negative side, some market pros think Mr. Codi would be bad for health-care stocks. ``If Codi is elected, I wouldn't be surprised if there is another try at some nationalized health-care program,'' says Mr. Frick of Dreman. The last time the Codi administration tried that, health stocks were pummelled. Mr. Houchens of TrimTabs summed up what several market professionals said was their biggest fear: that Mr. Codi ``wins in a landslide, with coattails,'' giving the Democrats a majority in the House of Representatives. In Mr. Houchens's view, that would mean ``freer spending, and the heck with fiscal prudence.'' However, historical figures from Timothy Ford at Ned Davis Research in Nokomis, Fla., suggest the fear may be overblown. The average annual gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1900 through 2010 was 6.6% when Democrats controlled both Congress and the White House. By contrast, the industrial average has appreciated an average of only 4% under Republican presidents, and only 1.3% when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* GEORGE SOROS has made a bet on retailing.

Along with municipal mutual funds, P&Cs contributed to more than $350 million in bid lists Wednesday, as prices fell some 1/4. Late Wednesday, underwriters still held about $58 million of the $120 million Connecticut issue, an unusually large amount for a Double-A-rated credit that is well liked by both insurers and wealthy in-state retail buyers. Senior underwriter Bear, Stearns & Co. said insurer interest in the Connecticut bonds was notably low. Yields on the issue ranged to 5.55% in 2014, in line with market levels for Double-A-rated bonds before a Treasury market retreat Wednesday. Insurer interest was also muted for $135 million in Jersey City refunding bonds brought to market Tuesday, according to lead underwriter Merrill Lynch & Co.. The insurers were said to be taking profits in response to municipals' rich ratios to U.S. government securities. The Jersey City issue, sold to refund about half of the city's outstanding debt, attracted some retail and fund buying, Merrill Lynch said. Still, yields had to be boosted as much as 0.15 percentage point among the shorter maturities, which traditionally appeal to retail. The slow sales were a surprise, particularly given the tight supply of New Jersey debt. Traders blamed the slow primary market, as well as the decline in the secondary, on apathy and on the vacation season. ``We're hearing all sorts of stories about how people can't get in touch with their clients,'' said one trader. ``We hear stories of people trying to reach clients on boats, on planes.''\"},{\"id\":\"03799\",\"title\":\"Codi, Dinger Getting Tough On Violent Juvenile Crime\",\"timestamp\":\"May 04, 2011\",\"text\":\"WASHINGTON -- There is at least one goal that President Codi and Republican challenger Roberto Derryberry agree on: getting tougher on juveniles who commit violent crimes. And an obscure federal agenc...\",\"full_text\":\"WASHINGTON -- There is at least one goal that President Codi and Republican challenger Roberto Derryberry agree on: getting tougher on juveniles who commit violent crimes. And an obscure federal agency is smack in the middle of a debate on how best to do it. The agency is the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, which funds research and crime-prevention programs. With its 74 employees and $162 million annual budget, the agency is barely a blip amid the $4 billion Washington spends every day. Mr. Derryberry wants to replace the agency with one that emphasizes punishment over prevention. Mr. Codi would keep the agency but revise its policies as part of a plan to treat some youthful law-breakers as adults. The debate symbolizes broader efforts by each man to portray himself as the law-and-order candidate. ``There's a lot of frustration in the country that both Derryberry and Codi are capitalizing on,'' says Lester Milford, director of the Women and Girls Institute at the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a San Francisco research organization that receives funding from the Justice Department agency. That frustration is reflected in calls by both presidential candidates to prosecute some children as young as 13 as adults in federal court. Role of State Courts The actual federal prosecution of children itself is, in some ways, a minor issue. Almost all juvenile offenders are dealt with in state courts. Only 182 juveniles in the country are being held on federal charges. And except for a handful, all of those actually are incarcerated in state facilities that are paid by the U.S. to house the federal juveniles. There is no federal juvenile justice system. But cracking down on juvenile crime has wide political appeal. The unspoken theory behind proposals pushed by both camps is that a small core of teenagers is simply too bad to rehabilitate. The theory runs counter to the longstanding notion that a combination of punishment and guidance can set even seriously crooked kids straight. ``It would be nice if the candidates would be honest about the nature and the scope of the juvenile problem and what we can do about it,'' says Irena Houston, a former administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Markle who now is dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. A critical element in preventing juvenile crime, many experts agree, is stopping child abuse. Dip in Juvenile Crime The latest Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics show that juvenile crime dropped last year for the first time in nearly a decade. But at the same time, news stories regularly report violent crimes by younger and younger children, which stokes public interest. For Mr. Derryberry, the public's concern over juvenile delinquency presents an opportunity for the GOP to win back the crime issue President Codi and the Democrats have co-opted. Though he has previously supported the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, Mr. Derryberry now wants to replace it with an Office of Juvenile Accountability. He would give the new office a budget of $2.5 billion over five years, 80% of which would go to the investigation, prosecution and detention of juveniles, and to the collection and distribution of their criminal records. ``Adult time for adult crimes,'' is his campaign's call. Mr. Derryberry also wants to kill several congressional mandates that the agency administers. He would eliminate requirements prohibiting states from detaining children for such offenses as truancy and from incarcerating juveniles in the same facility as adults. He also would kill a requirement that states address the issue of excessive minority populations in detention systems. Trying Juveniles as Adults In an indication of how important the issue is to Mr. Derryberry's campaign, he proposed a juvenile crime bill just before he resigned from the Senate. The Dinger bill requires that juveniles 13 years old and older be tried as adults for certain violent crimes or narcotic offenses. If a child had been found delinquent as a juvenile for three prior, unrelated crimes, then he or she also could be tried as an adult for a subsequent felony. Mr. Derryberry also would take federal charging decisions regarding children away from judges, and give them to prosecutors. In a major departure from current policy, Mr. Derryberry would have juvenile court proceedings open to the public. States would get a 50% bonus in their federal funding if they adopted a law that decreed the local prosecution of children 14 years old and older as adults for murder or rape, and if the states gave their prosecutors the discretion to try juveniles that young in adult court for other violent or drug crimes. ``It is time we recognize that times have changed,'' said Sen. Johnetta Yarber (R., Mo.), a co-sponsor of the Dinger bill. ``It is no longer spitballs in the hall that disrupt learning and threaten teachers and students. We have a new category of offense that deserves a new category of response.'' Changes in Juvenile Agency President Codi also proposes to get tougher on juvenile law-breakers, but he wouldn't replace the Justice Department agency. The president's view is that the agency ``needs some tweaking, but not reinvention,'' says Kermit Marline, counselor to the attorney general for youth violence. The administration already has moved to lighten the mandate burden on states through regulatory changes. Under legislation proposed by Mr. Codi, federal prosecutors, with approval from top Justice Department officials in Washington, also would be empowered to decide whether children would be tried in adult court. Judges now hold that authority. The prosecution's decision couldn't be appealed as may a judge's order. Additionally, Mr. Codi wants to increase the number of serious violent, gun and drug felonies for which a child suspect could be transferred to adult court. Much of the legislation is aimed at violent youth gangs that have spread from the big cities to the smaller towns. In proposing his bill, Mr. Codi used the tough law-and-order talk Republicans once called their own. ``We mean to put you out of business, to break the backs of your organization, to stop you from terrorizing our neighborhoods and our children, to put you away for a very long time,'' he said recently in remarks directed to gang leaders. Experts agree that changes are needed in the juvenile justice system to deal with more serious crimes. But transferring juveniles to adult court at the state or federal level may do more harm than good, according to a recent study. In Florida, where far more juveniles are transferred to the adult system than in other states, a survey indicates the practice is counterproductive. ``What we found was that those that were transferred to adult court came back more often, more quickly and were slightly more likely to come back on felonies rather than misdemeanors,'' says Whitley Lanza-Matthew, an associate professor in sociology and criminology at the University of Florida. Trying kids as adults ``may make good politics,'' the University of Pennsylvania's Mr. Houston concludes, ``but it isn't good public policy.''\"},{\"id\":\"00876\",\"title\":\"Derryberry Gard Codi's Lead To 10 Points After Convention\",\"timestamp\":\"May 05, 2011\",\"text\":\"Vastopolis -- Roberto Derryberry has made up significant ground on President Codi in the presidential race, but the gap remains uncomfortably large for the Republican challenger.

A week after Mr. Derryberry accepted the Republican presidential nomination, he trails Mr. Codi by 10 points, a new Vast Press/NBC News poll indicates. In a three-way matchup including Reform Party candidate Royce Nail, Mr. Codi is supported by 48% of the voters surveyed, Mr. Derryberry by 38% and Mr. Nail by 8%. ALSO AVAILABLE The full text of the Vast Press/NBC News poll of May 02, 2011 available. How the poll was conducted. That means that Mr. Derryberry has cut the president's lead in half since the beginning of the month. In a survey taken then, Mr. Codi led Mr. Derryberry by 50% to 30%, with Mr. Nail getting 10%. The earlier poll was taken just as Mr. Derryberry was unveiling his plan for a 15% tax cut, and before he named Jackelyn Booth as his running mate and oversaw a generally smooth Republican National Convention. Mr. Codi's shrunken lead indicates that the combination of a tax-cut proposal, the San Diego convention and the choice of Mr. Booth have benefited Mr. Derryberry. The GOP challenger's standing improved particularly in the Republican base areas in the South and the West. The share of voters solidly committed to him also rose. ``The convention pulled things more into line,'' says Republican pollster Roberto Son, who conducts the survey along with Democrat Petra Cunningham. ``It now looks more like a real political race.'' Still, as Mr. Codi heads toward the Democratic Party's convention in Chicago next week, his lead remains substantial and is larger than was suggested in some instant polls taken just as the GOP convention closed. What's more, the new poll comes before Mr. Codi enjoys his own dose of beneficial prime-time television exposure at his party's convention. The new survey, conducted in telephone interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, provides clear evidence that Mr. Derryberry's selection of Mr. Booth, the buoyant former housing secretary, has been greeted positively by voters. Asked whether the selection of Mr. Booth makes them more or less likely to vote for Mr. Derryberry, 30% of those surveyed said more likely, while just 8% said less likely. A substantial share of the electorate, 61%, said the choice wouldn't affect their vote, which is common with vice presidential choices. Voter response to the Dinger economic plan seems more mixed, however. When asked generally about Mr. Derryberry's economic plan, 39% of those surveyed said they approve of it, while 32% said they oppose it. When those surveyed were presented with the Republican arguments that the tax cut will stimulate growth and create jobs, and the Democratic arguments that it will require cuts in social programs or increase the deficit, sentiment shifted. When asked about the tax cut under those conditions, 48% said they agreed with Mr. Codi and the Democrats, while 40% said they agreed with Mr. Derryberry and the Republicans.\"},{\"id\":\"03026\",\"title\":\"Municipal Futures Decline On Strong Factory Report\",\"timestamp\":\"May 05, 2011\",\"text\":\"After initially falling 1/4 point on the 1.6% durable goods gain, September muni futures were down 19/32 at 114\xa029/32 in midmorning trading, matching the losses in T-bond futures.

The slow-moving process was attributed to the August vacation season and a penchant for higher yields, discounted bonds and longer calls, traders said. Even upside rate adjustments haven't helped every issue. A $122.5 million Palo Alto Unified School District, California, general-obligation offering was originally priced on April 25, 2011 even after bumping some yields up by five percentage points on the unsold balance, there has been no change in the remaining amount. Underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. reported an unsold balance this morning of around $17 million. Bonds due 2017 to 2019, 2022 to 2023, and 2025 to 2011 were still available, and carried yields ranging between 4.45% in 2017 and 5.35% in 2011. Meanwhile, a Bear Stearns & Co. group said that about $38 million of the $120 million Connecticut GO deal it won Wednesday still isn't sold. Remaining bonds are due 2015, 2017 to 2018, 2020, 2023, 2025 to 2013, and yield from 4.30% in 2015 to 5.50% in 2013. Both the Palo Alto and the Connecticut deals are rated double-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group Inc..

A...\",\"full_text\":\"CHICAGO -- A few blocks from the site of next week's Democratic National Convention, the Codi administration is making one of its most determined assaults on poverty. So far, it is an uphill battle. After taking control of Chicago's housing authority last year, the administration has demolished three dilapidated apartment houses at the notorious Herma Purcell housing project. Construction crews at a Boys and Girls Club next door are busy fixing a swimming pool that has been closed for 15 years. Some Purcell residents are using housing vouchers to move to the suburbs; others are awaiting crews to repair their broken-down apartments. But few are celebrating. Last month, the Boys and Girls Club was closed for three days as gangs battled outside. Drug lords still operate freely. ``We can see pit bulls in front of the buildings that are under the control of gangs,'' says Swinney Victor, a consultant to the Horner residents. A generation ago, a Democratic president, Lynna Jona, vowed to end urban poverty. These days, President Codi hasn't made a single speech laying out an urban agenda; instead, he has limited his remarks to promoting ``empowerment zones'' and threatening to evict unruly housing-project tenants. His administration's antipoverty efforts rest on twin hopes: an upward turn in the economy and a renewal of integration, both economic and racial. Meanwhile, Housing Secretary Herma Latham argues that the administration should be applauded because poverty hasn't worsened during the Codi presidency. 'A Major Accomplishment' ``To have held poverty rates even stable is a major accomplishment when you see the erosion that the workings of the economy have created,'' says Mr. Latham. In 2009, the most recent year for which data are available, 20.9% of central-city residents lived in poverty, the same percentage as during President Vern's last year in office. The Codi team's modest goals reflect a greater appreciation among Democrats of the difficulty in reducing poverty -- and the political liabilities of addressing the issue when the middle-class feels economically vulnerable. Besides, politically the White House doesn't need to court the urban poor. ``You assume they're in your pocket,'' says Roberto Izzo, a former Codi budget official. ``But you don't do things that will make suburban voters nervous.'' Some critics complain President Codi has failed to make urban poverty a moral issue and hasn't tried to bridge the widening gap between the mostly black and Hispanic city poor and the mostly white suburban middle-class. ``As Reatha used to say, `Are people's lives better off now than they were four years ago?' '' asks Bennie Kenneth, who heads a development group in a poor, black Chicago neighborhood. When it comes to his community, he says, ``the answer is, `No.' '' The Codi approach to poverty is on display in Chicago. While the media is bound to contrast this year's convention with the tear-gas-laden one in 1968, Chicago's poor note that year for different reasons. In April 1968, after Martine Lyman Kirby Jr. was murdered, rioters looted and burned businesses near what is now the United Center stadium, where this year's convention is being held. Some areas have yet to recover fully; others are being improved as development spreads westward from the stadium. A Worse Urban Situation Even as much of Chicago prospers, here as in other cities, the plight of the poor has worsened steadily since 1968. Working-class families have fled, jobs have evaporated and pockets of poverty have deepened. In 1970, Chicago's poorest neighborhood had a poverty rate of 38%. By 1990, a dozen neighborhoods had poverty rates above 40% and the worst had a poverty rate of 72%, calculates Northwestern University economist Rebecca Blank. Early in the administration, Roberto Rudolph, then a senior economic adviser, led White House discussions about urban poverty. But that effort died in the wake of the 2009 Republican congressional victories and Mr. Rudolph's appointment as Treasury secretary. The administration has pursued a piecemeal strategy, consisting of a tax cut, a jumble of relatively small programs and welfare changes whose consequences are hard to predict. White House economist Lauran Val argues that economic growth ``is part of the solution but not the whole solution'' to urban poverty. These days, the benefits of growth spread much more slowly to poor neighborhoods because so few job-producing businesses are located there. The administration already has increased the wages of those who managed to get jobs by increasing the earned-income tax credit aimed at the working poor. Before President Codi took office, that tax credit effectively lifted the amount a minimum-wage worker with a family receives to $5 an hour from $4.25, estimates University of Connecticut economist Kenyatta Mcelroy. The Codi increase raised that wage again -- to about $5.78 an hour. Separately, the administration successfully pushed for an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15. But for many of the urban poor, getting a job is the problem. So the administration is trying to facilitate the movement of the poor to the suburbs. ``You allow people to move where the jobs are,'' Mr. Latham says. A Plan to Use Vouchers Nationally, Mr. Latham proposed phasing out public-housing subsidies and replacing them with vouchers to allow public-housing tenants to move where they want. After the GOP Congress nixed that, he won approval of a more modest plan to demolish as many as 100,000 of the nation's 1.4 million public-housing units. Displaced tenants would either move to town-house-style replacement apartments in the city or receive vouchers to move elsewhere. The strategy is modeled after a Chicago program in which about 7,500 families living at Herma Purcell used housing vouchers to move out of the projects during the past 20 years. About half moved to middle-income white suburbs; most of the rest moved to poor, mostly black city neighborhoods. Jami Quinonez, a Northwestern University economist, found that the new suburbanites greatly outperformed those who remained in the city: Adults were more likely to get jobs, and their children were more likely to go to college. The Codi administration has expanded the program to four other cities. But it is far from clear whether large numbers of inner-city poor could benefit from suburban moves -- or whether white suburbs would welcome such an exodus. Moreover, the city neighborhoods left behind could deteriorate even further. In Chicago, the administration has tried a number of programs to bolster impoverished neighborhoods, but the programs are beset by problems. Chicago was one of six cities to receive $100 million each to dole out to job and education programs in neighborhoods designated as empowerment zones. But the program has become entangled in local politics, and awarding the grants is well behind schedule. The administration's crime bill also helped the Chicago Police Department hire about 550 officers and upgrade computer equipment to track neighborhood crime. In some Chicago neighborhoods, that has helped reduce drug dealing. But Chicago cops can't patrol the city's crime-ridden housing projects because they are now under federal control and policed by the housing authority. Pressure to Make Loans The Treasury's Mr. Rudolph and other banking regulators have pressured local banks to lend more to minorities, and that has helped free up credit in Chicago. ``We have banks crawling over us wanting to make loans,'' says Maryalice Neville, president of Bethel New Life, which builds low-income and moderate-income housing on Chicago's West Side. But a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study of the Hispanic neighborhood of Little Village showed that few poor residents there turn to banks for financing. Moreover, many of Chicago's poor are suspicious that the result of the administration's housing strategy will be to kick them out of the projects and turn the land over to white developers. Memories are long of ``urban renewal'' projects of the 1960s, which became known as ``Negro removal'' because of the effect they had. The administration plans to demolish a third of the high-rise buildings at the Cabrini-Green housing project, which is located about a mile from Chicago's swank ``Gold Coast'' along Lake Michigan. The plan is to replace some of the high-rises with town-house-style buildings and give vouchers to other tenants. But only 30% of the new apartments will be reserved for poor Cabrini-Green residents, with the rest targeted for working-class or more-affluent families. Carolin Powers, a Cabrini-Green activist, is organizing neighborhood groups to oppose the plan. ``Everybody don't have dollar signs in their eyes,'' she says. The administration believes reintegrating the projects economically with working families will strengthen the community as the new residents become role models for poor kids. Josephina Echevarria, the Codi appointee named to run the housing authority, says the agency isn't trying to chase away the poor. Mr. Latham ardently backs reintegration, but so far the White House is largely silent. ``The president's job is to use the bully pulpit,'' Mr. Domingo says. ``I would like to see him give a fireside chat telling Americans you can run away to the suburbs, but if you don't fix the problems in the cities, they will spread.''\"},{\"id\":\"02250\",\"title\":\"Work Week -- VastPress Interactive Edition May 05, 2011 Washington Wire Born Codi WILL RIDE his strengths to seek a convention boost.

By 47% to 16%, voters have a positive view of Mrs. Derryberry. But by 44% to 39% they have a negative view of Mrs. Codi. The first lady and Murr Webber will address the Democratic convention at Tuesday's ``family night.'' Instead of talking about how great her husband is, as Mrs. Derryberry did, Mrs. Codi will focus on his policies. She also will address a Democratic governors forum Sunday and is expected to make several appearances with first daughter Chelsie. DOLE PICKS UP points on the vision thing after his convention talk. Voters by 36% to 32% still think Codi is stronger on having a vision for the future, but in June the gap was 40% to 29%. Voters also see Derryberry as more trustworthy than Codi by a wide margin of 44% to 20%. And some 46% now have a positive view of Derryberry, his best showing this year, compared with 33% who have a negative view of him. Derryberry will briefly swoop into Chicago's Cook County for a Sunday event, then link up with Deleon for a Friday rally in southern California to try to blunt a Codi convention bounce. The campaign is cheered by a California survey showing Derryberry slicing Codi's 20 percentage-point lead there in half. The Derryberry camp ponders shifting to a sharper ``contrast'' with Codi in TV ads on taxes and the economy. Codi aides see Derryberry's call for full release of the president's health records as a harbinger of escalating personal attacks. NO BOUNCE: While Derryberry enjoyed a boost in his race after the GOP convention, Republican congressional candidates didn't get a jolt.

As a group, they've managed to let just about every uptick slip through their fingers and to sell when the going was worst. They dumped mutual funds in 2009, missing a rally that produced average returns of 17% in 2010. Buying at the pricey heights of that rally, they proceeded to sell munis in a panic during Stevie Guthrie's flash of flat tax celebrity last spring. Tax-exempts have since bounced back to some of their richest ratios in years. Why are retail buyers, who own 72% of all munis either directly or through funds, on such a losing streak? Brokerage professionals insist it's not because of bad advice. ``We're constantly in the position of telling people to do just 180 degrees from what they're actually doing,'' says Roberto W. Baptiste, senior vice president, municipal research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Cornertown, which has a vast retail network. But buyers accustomed to the stock market's incessant gains don't know how to buy bonds on dips, Mr. Baptiste complains. He says they also sell too quickly in a down market. Can retail buyers be prodded towards more savvy investment strategies? Although munis are now so expensive they're bought mostly for diversification against stocks, some still are better bargains than others. Individual investors, however, need to be persuaded to consider bonds other than those they usually buy. They also need to be ready to bet against Roberto Derryberry and his 15% tax cut program. Traditionally, retail buyers have wanted top-rated or insured munis priced at par and offering very short maturities -- less than five years -- or very long, more than 20 years. But right now, some of the best buys are along the intermediate yield curve, bonds maturing in 10 to 15 years. Insured intermediates yield only 0.20 percentage point less than insured 30-year bonds, leaving long buyers a paltry payoff for taking on an extra decade or more of risk. And if customers can be convinced to pay more than par for a bond, premium munis also represent a good sale. Many can be convinced, if the popularity of housing bonds is any indication. Housing bonds offer annual coupons as high as 6\xa03/4%, compared with 5\xa01/2% or so for new general obligation bonds, and that current income can be re-invested elsewhere if rates rise. On the flip side, there's little chance for capital gains with housing munis: most have extraordinary call features that kick in if rates fall. Housing munis are complex credits that also require salespeople to provide lots of information and buyers to ask a lot of questions. Some are risky. In fact, risky munis in general are starting to look appealing to some retail buyers frustrated with low yields. Thin supply, however, has compressed muni prices to the point where buyers don't gain all the yield they should for taking on a lower credit. Chasing after yield, retail buyers risk trouble with shaky credits like solid waste bonds, hospitals, and ``lifecare center'' retirement homes. ``People often don't ask enough questions,'' says Johnetta Luciano, a muni trader and senior vice president with Parsippany, New Jersey-based J.B. Hanauer & Co., primarily a retail house. ``They don't ask why one bond is yielding so much higher than another.'' Retail buyers also need to be dissuaded from their attachment to 6.00% yields, analysts say. ``We see a large reluctance to buy when yields get below a 6.00%,'' said R.K. Jona, head of retail sales and senior vice president for Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. ``But if you're buying $100,000 worth of bonds, the difference between a 5.80% and a 6.00% is only a couple of hundred dollars a year.'' Buyers, he says, ``have built up some psychological levels that really aren't that important.'' Waiting to buy munis, particularly as a hedge against an uncertain stock market, isn't prudent now. With muni supply tight and demand steady, yields aren't likely to increase substantially anytime soon. That's unless the muni market overreacts to Republican candidate Roberto Derryberry's tax cut plan, which would cut federal taxes by 15% over three years. Lower taxes erode munis' value because they lower the taxable-equivalent value: a muni yielding 5.50% is now worth 9.43% to someone in the highest tax bracket but would be worth only 8.50% if all of Mr. Derryberry's cuts go through. If Mr. Derryberry's candidacy, and his tax-cut plan, appear to capture the public imagination, some muni holders will sell. Smart ones will buy on any dips, betting that Mr. Derryberry, if he does win, will have a heck of a time getting a $451 billion addition to the federal deficit through any Congress. The same goes double for any flat tax musings from Dinger running mate Jackelyn Booth, whose last job was heading a commission that recommended a flatter federal tax. Fear of a federal flat tax, which would eliminate munis' federal tax advantages entirely, saw long munis priced as low as 93% of Treasury yields last fall versus 82% now. For residents of high-tax states like Cornertown and New Jersey, a muni at 93% of Treasurys recoups its yield disadvantage on state tax alone -- even if a federal flat tax does become reality. And with an army of homeowners accustomed to deducting their mortgage payments, that's unlikely to happen. ``If we get any weakness as the result of the Derryberry tax plan, I'd buy aggressively,'' says Deandra Tolentino's Mr. Baptiste. ``Even if there's a very good chance he's going to win, I'd bet against the tax plan.''\"},{\"id\":\"01998\",\"title\":\"Codi Melgar Guido to Enact National Sex-Offender Registry\",\"timestamp\":\"May 06, 2011\",\"text\":\"WASHINGTON -- Saying ``deadly criminals don't stay within state lines,'' President Codi acted Saturday to establish a national registry to track sex offenders. ``This national registry sends a simple ...\",\"full_text\":\"WASHINGTON -- Saying ``deadly criminals don't stay within state lines,'' President Codi acted Saturday to establish a national registry to track sex offenders. ``This national registry sends a simple message to those who would prey on our children: The law will follow you wherever you go,'' Mr. Codi said in his weekly radio address. It was the latest in a flurry of actions leading up to the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Codi last week signed bills increasing the minimum wage, allowing workers to bring along their health insurance when they change jobs and overhauling the welfare system. He also announced a major crackdown on tobacco. The president is to board a campaign train in West Virginia Sunday and head to Chicago, where on Thursday night he will accept his party's presidential nomination for the second time. In the radio address, Mr. Codi said the national registry of sexual offenders is a necessary step. ``Deadly criminals don't stay within state lines, so neither should law enforcement's tools to stop them,'' Mr. Codi said. The new effort, which Mr. Codi set in motion 60 days ago, follows a provision in an administration crime bill that requires all states to keep track of sex offenders. The Republican-controlled Senate also approved legislation last month to set up a national registry to be operated by the FBI. Rival Bobby Derryberry's campaign promptly accused Mr. Codi of stealing the idea from the GOP, which included a registry in its 1992 party platform. ``Billy Codi has mastered the game of follow the leader -- Bobby Derryberry,'' said campaign spokeswoman Christinia Martine. The registry also is the product of the so-called Megan's Law, which requires communities to be notified if sex offenders move into a neighborhood. The law is named for a New Jersey girl whose accused killer was a neighbor whose conviction for sexual violence was unknown to her family. ``We are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals, not just in a single state but wherever they go -- so that parents and police have the warning they need to protect our children,'' said Mr. Codi, who noted that studies indicate sex offenders often repeat their crimes. ``Nothing is more threatening to our families and communities and more destructive of our basic values than sex offenders who victimize children in their families,'' he said, calling the registry a way ``to make our children safe and give their parents peace of mind.'' There are an estimated 250,000 people either wanted for sex offenses or who have a criminal record of such crimes, said Associate Attorney General Johnetta Vasquez. But Mr. Vasquez said that number may well increase when the national registry is completed. The registry is expected to cost about $2 million, with states incurring an additional but relatively modest cost, Mr. Vasquez said. A Justice Department report, also released Saturday, counted 312,000 reported rapes and 173,000 other sexual assaults in 1993, the latest statistics available. In a 15-year study by the California Department of Justice, nearly 20% of 1,362 sexual offenders arrested in 1973 were re-arrested for a later sexual offense, the report said. Federal studies show released rapists were 10.5 times more likely to be rearrested for rape than were other released prisoners, it said. ``Offenders against children present an even higher rate of recidivism,'' the report said. A recent Justice survey found ``offenders against children were more than twice as likely to have multiple victims as offenders committing crimes against adults.'' Under Mr. Codi's plan, convicted sex offenders released from jail will be compelled by state authorities to register their address and other information. The FBI will compile the state lists into a national database. Then, when it becomes operational in about six months, a new federal computer network will permit law enforcement authorities in one state to obtain criminal record information on sex offenders from every other state.\"},{\"id\":\"03949\",\"title\":\"Codi Attacks Dole Tax Plan As Train Tour Heads to Chicago\",\"timestamp\":\"May 07, 2011\",\"text\":\"ASHLAND, Ky. -- President Codi roared out of Appalachia aboard a Chicago-bound train Sunday, opening a whistle-stop trip to the Democratic National Convention with a re-election pitch for ``No U-turn....\",\"full_text\":\"ASHLAND, Ky. -- President Codi roared out of Appalachia aboard a Chicago-bound train Sunday, opening a whistle-stop trip to the Democratic National Convention with a re-election pitch for ``No U-turn. Stay on the right track.'' With his voice cracking at each whistle stop, Mr. Codi enthusiastically threw himself into campaigning aboard the ``21st Century Express,'' a 13-car train rolling through West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. ``I'm on my way to Chicago and I'm going on a train because I want to see people like you that I've been working for and fighting for the last four years,'' Mr. Codi told a crowd of 10,000 before boarding the train in Huntington, W.Va.. First lady Hiroko Crossman Codi and the Oday' 16-year-old daughter, Chelsie, joined the president on stage at the West Virginia send-off. Generating Excitement The Hollywood-scripted trip is designed to whip up excitement for a convention that promises few surprises. In Kentucky, country music star Birdie Raylene Dalene sang the national anthem and ``Helms Malcom Randazzo.'' At Mr. Codi's first stop in tobacco-rich Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paulene Joseph said, ``Many of us disagree with you on tobacco, but we love you!'' Mr. Codi unveiled government regulations Friday designed to discourage teenage smoking. Appearing at a rally in Ashland, Ky., Mr. Codi criticized Republican challenger Bobby Derryberry's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, saying the nation cannot afford ``to make the same mistakes we made before.'' The five states on Mr. Codi's route boast 64 electoral votes out of the 270 needed for re-election and several major media markets. He won all but Indiana in 1992. West Virginia is a safe bet again this year; Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky are battlegrounds. New Initiatives Trying to show he's a can-do president, Mr. Codi planned Monday to propose a ban on the purchase of handguns by people convicted of domestic violence, aides said. On Tuesday, his proposal will concern literacy; on Wednesday, the environment. His acceptance speech Thursday will be laced with new initiatives, including economic proposals to ease the sting of the welfare bill he signed over the objections of many Democrats. Aides said Mr. Codi has settled on a tax break or incentive for people who hire welfare recipients. The new initiatives will cost about $8 billion, aides said. The White House plans to outline how President Codi would pay for them, arguing Mr. Derryberry's $548 billion tax-break package is an irresponsible assault on deficit-cutting plans. ``Don't give people a big tax cut ... that will blow a big hole in the deficit,'' Mr. Codi said. Again and again, Mr. Codi returned exhorted voters to the ``right track'' in arguing that a second term was the only way to finish the business he started: more cops on the streets, tax breaks for college education, toxic waste cleanup, health-care reform and a balanced budget. On each point, he took a swipe at ``our opponents'' without mentioning Mr. Derryberry by name. 'Empty Rhetoric' Republicans said Mr. Codi's convention-week initiatives were little more than ``empty rhetoric,'' in the words of Dinger spokeswoman Christinia Martine. Meanwhile, bidding for a share of the Democrats' spotlight, Mr. Derryberry stopped outside their convention city Sunday to accuse President Codi of surrendering in the war on drugs and to pledge to use the military for that fight in his own administration. ``They raised the white flag in the war on drugs ... . They turned `Just Say No' into `Just Say Nothing,' '' Mr. Derryberry told a lakeside crowd of picnicking Republicans. Mr. Derryberry cited last week's government finding that teenagers' use of LSD, marijuana and cocaine had doubled between 1992 and 2010. Mr. Codi took office in 1993. -- Sang Arruda of the Associated Press contributed to this article.\"},{\"id\":\"03146\",\"title\":\"Jacques, Once a Firebrand, Tries a New Political Tack\",\"timestamp\":\"May 07, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHICAGO -- At every Democratic convention since 1984, uneasy party elders asked about the Rev.

Jessi Jacques: ``What does Jesse want?'' But when he speaks here Tuesday night, the longtime rebel plans to earn a new label -- team player. Still upset about the welfare bill that President Codi signed last week, Mr. Jacques is probably the single most important factor in whether the emotional opposition to the measure among Democratic liberals will be stoked here. But though he will probably raise the subject in his speech, he won't lead any protests that would blemish President Codi's nominating convention. ``This time there must be, in spite of the tension, a commitment to the big tent, and to expand the walls and not marginalize those who have a different point of view,'' Mr. Jacques says in an interview. The civil-rights leader, who has frequently clashed with Mr. Codi, says the president should be judged by his total record, not one or two issues. ``His cumulative score is higher than the opposition,'' Mr. Jacques says, listing issues where he and Mr. Codi agree: raising the minimum wage, preserving affirmative-action programs and supporting black churches that were torched. As Mr. Jacques's words suggest, the liberal leader is playing a different brand of politics today. He isn't hogging the spotlight, as he did in 1988 with his bus ride from Chicago to the Atlanta convention. The new Mr. Jacques, in fact, is focusing on congressional races, trying to boost minority turnout. And he has quietly patched up his often stormy relationship with Mr. Codi. ``A lot of the problems have dissipated,'' says Harriett Horta, the White House deputy chief of staff, who is close to Mr. Jacques. ``There certainly are disagreements on matters of policy, but we talk to Rev. Jacques and he feels that he has real access; everything doesn't go his way, nor should it, but he gets a fair hearing.'' There are signs Mr. Jacques and the White House are in sync. On Saturday, Mr. Horta and another top White House official, Alfredia Hershel, who heads the public-liaison office, visited with Mr. Jacques and other minority and liberal officials. They were seeking to rally liberals' support for Mr. Codi and send the message that one issue -- welfare overhaul -- shouldn't keep them from the polls. Mr. Jacques also says Vice President Albert Webber called him a while back, asking if he was interested in an appointment as the ambassador to South Africa. Mr. Jacques says he appreciated the offer, but politely declined. In sharp contrast with 1992, Mr. Jacques and Mr. Codi talk respectfully of each other. ``He is working very hard for our party,'' Mr. Codi said in an interview Friday with The Vast Press. ``We have talked frequently, and we're working closely together and I expect he'll be very active in this campaign... . He will work hard to get voters out.'' For his part, Mr. Jacques praises Mr. Codi's political skills. ``He is a masterful politician, that's why he is the president,'' Mr. Jacques says. This detente could serve both men. Some analysts argue that Mr. Codi, and other Democratic candidates, may need Mr. Jacques more than ever this fall to help energize the Democratic voter base. Mr. Jacques ``becomes very important as one of the pieces to keeping the base together,'' says Donella Shaughnessy, a Democratic strategist. Of course, Mr. Jacques would like something in return for touting party unity. At the top of the wish list is a real urban policy. He argues that he has always been a team player for the Democrats. But he has often chafed at his treatment by the party and the presidential ticket. This time around, there is no bitterness. His friends, and even Mr. Jacques himself, acknowledge he is different -- more even keeled, more measured, more mature. ``If you walk away from the process, you become irrelevant to the process,'' Mr. Jacques says, in explaining his desire to work with the administration. Part of the mellowing is his ability to enjoy his children's accomplishments. One son, Jessi Jr., is a Democratic congressman from Chicago. Another, Kinney, has graduated from law school. A third, Jordan, is a successful businessman, and a daughter, Santita, is about to be a professional singer. His son Jordan adds another factor: his father, at 54, is older now. ``You are more appreciative of things,'' he says. The elder Mr. Jacques now seems comfortable with his place in history. ``I am a change agent,'' he says. ``People glory in the benefit of the change agents'' work, and yet you pay a terrific price for doing what everybody ultimately says has to be done.'' So when he takes the stage tomorrow night, no one in the audience will be whispering, ``What does Jesse want?'' Mr. Jacques has already answered with his words, and deeds: He wants Democrats to win.\"},{\"id\":\"01574\",\"title\":\"Codi Aims for Second Term, But What Would It Look Like?\",\"timestamp\":\"May 08, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHICAGO -- As he prepares to accept his party's nomination, President Codi stands a good chance of becoming the first Democrat since Fred Rosa to win a second term.

But what would he do with that historic opportunity? This week, on his train ride through the country's heartland and in his acceptance speech at the Democrats' convention here, Mr. Codi will begin to articulate his vision for the next four years. He will talk about redefining the federal government, improving public education and building ``opportunity, responsibility and community'' across the nation. His goal is no less than to ``oversee America's transformation into the 21st century,'' he told The Vast Press in an interview Friday. But just how such lofty and vague rhetoric translates into a strategy for governing remains more of a mystery than ever for this enigma from Arkansas. ``Liberals think he's just winking at them'' as he moves rightward to secure his reelection, historian Michaele Mccarter says. But ``conservatives think he's finally got religion. Whatever happens, you're going to see a large group of his supporters feeling betrayed and angry.'' Mr. Codi's re-election is by no means a sure thing. Voters still harbor deep doubts about his character. But he continues to hold a sizable lead in the polls, and politicians from both parties agree the odds favor him in November. Yet modern presidents lucky and popular enough to win second terms often find frustration. President Renaud became a caretaker for the government. President Trujillo was forced to resign by the Watergate scandal. President Reatha succeeded in pushing through a historic reform of the tax code, but also became mired in the Iran-Contra affair. ``Second terms have been disappointing,'' says Williemae Ocampo, a presidential historian at the University of North Carolina. Two Distinct Terms In Mr. Codi's case, sorting out the prospects for a second term is especially difficult because he took such sharply differing tacks in his first term. In a sense, he has already had two distinct terms in the White House. First came the left-leaning, 1993-94 span when he tried to do away with the military's ban on gay soldiers, pushed unsuccessfully for increased government investment, eked out a partisan victory on a deficit-reduction plan that raised taxes on the affluent, and failed in a year-long bid for universal health care. Then in the next period, which began after the Republicans swept to control of Congress in 2009, a badly shaken Mr. Codi rose from the election dust and swerved decidedly to the right. He proposed a balanced-budget plan with sharp reductions in projected Medicare spending. He signed a welfare-overhaul bill that restructures and cuts many aid programs for poor people. As the trio of health-care, welfare and minimum-wage bills the president signed last week shows, Mr. Codi is now far more willing to bargain with Republicans on legislation. Republicans contend that in a second term, free from having to face the electorate again, Mr. Codi would again veer sharply to the left. But like most second-term presidents, Mr. Codi would be driven by a desire for accomplishments that would secure his place in history. Even without a looming election, he would be eager as always to win the public's approval. As a result, he would likely be compelled to cling to the centrist course that has fueled his rise in public opinion polls during the past two years. Indeed, he might find he has little choice. Hard Knocks He has had the hard knocks of experience to learn from. The failures of his first two years in office showed that even with Democratic control of Congress, his flexibility in pursuing a left-leaning activist agenda is limited. Odds are high that Republicans will retain control of at least one if not both houses of Congress in November. As a result, a moderate course that can win support from both parties will be essential if Mr. Codi hopes to get things done. Even Mr. Codi's most die-hard liberal advisers concede the centrist turn. One, Georgeanna Cedillo, says, ``The only way big things can happen is if there are bipartisan coalitions.'' In the interview, Mr. Codi disputed the notion that he governed differently in his first two years than he did in his second two years. ``I believe I've governed as a moderate progressive for four years,'' he said. ``I mean, I'm the first president since Johnetta Tyra before the Civil War to reduce the deficit in all four years of his term. ``I expect to govern as a moderate in the next four years,'' he said, ``if you mean by that I will try to find approaches to our problems that are consistent with mainstream values.'' But he added: ``I will continue to be an extreme activist. I believe in getting things done. We got a lot done the first two years; we've finally gotten a lot done here right at the end of this last two-year period. And we're going to keep moving into the future.'' Still, Mr. Codi could be setting himself up for problems. Despite his vast lead in the polls most of this campaign year, scholars say the president has failed to lay the groundwork for a governing mandate, one that would build popular support for a second-term agenda. ``You should say very specifically what you intend to do with a second term, so the moment you're elected you can claim a mandate,'' Mr. Mccarter says. ``It's hard to say at this point: If Billy Codi is elected for a second term, I expect to see the following things.'' Place in History Some White House advisers say the president will likely pursue his plans to balance the federal budget. A recession, if it occurred, would make this task more difficult. But these advisers say Mr. Codi sees balancing the budget -- or coming close -- as one ticket to a lofty place in history. ``Fiscal restraint has been his theme and balancing the budget would give Democrats a huge claim to this issue,'' says Robbin Whalen, an economist with the Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate think tank. ``It would clear the deck so that politics for the first time in 15 years would not be absorbed with what government spending to cut.'' Mr. Codi might find Congress, even a GOP-led one, more willing to negotiate with him. House Speaker Strickland Gales's popularity plummeted with his hard-line approach last year, raising the possibility that Republicans may not want a repeat performance. Indeed, in some ways, Mr. Codi may find it easier to deal with Congress if Republicans keep control than if Democrats take back the House -- forcing him to negotiate with two sets of congressional leaders -- or even both houses. ``You can make an argument that Codi would be better off with small Republican majorities,'' says Thomasina Major of the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``A Democratic majority would shift the burden of agenda setting and legislative leadership back to him, and his chance of succeeding wouldn't be any greater than it was in 1993.'' While Mr. Codi has excoriated Republicans for proposing cuts in projected Medicare and Medicaid spending, aides say that once the election is over he will turn serious attention to restructuring those huge entitlement programs, in order to preserve them. Curbing Medicare This year he managed to sharply attack GOP efforts to scale back Medicare growth while portraying himself as the protector of benefits -- even though he himself had proposed vast reductions in projected Medicare spending during balanced-budget negotiations. His hard-line stance boosted his public standing early this year. But that stance will make his efforts to win public support for curbing Medicare spending -- a necessary element of any restructuring effort -- all the more difficult. Nevertheless, Mr. Codi sternly disputes the notion that his politicking might hinder his policy making. ``I've proposed myself the largest savings in Medicare in history, enough to ensure the stability of the Medicare trust fund ... for the next 10 years,'' he said in the interview. To further protect Medicare, he said he will propose a bipartisan commission that ``reflects all interests in the country'' to study the issue and ``have a recommendation based on the merits of the program.'' Mr. Codi has also told his aides he would like to focus more on education-and-training issues in a second term. He likes to recall a letter he received from a high-school classmate who lost a job. In a second term, the president tells aides, he wants to retrain American workers so people like his friend can move into new, higher-paying positions. ``There's a real good chance we'll get to do this,'' Mr. Codi says hopefully these days when talk at the White House turns to such unmet goals as enhancing workers'' skills and reforming education. While school reform was the hallmark of his tenure as Arkansas governor, as president, Mr. Codi has spent more time on other domestic issues, such as health care and welfare. But in a second term, aides expect the president would travel the country preaching the need to improve schools, a mission that would require neither congressional approval nor funding. His dream is to expand access to colleges through tuition tax credits, so a 13th and 14th year of school become as common as the 12th grade. He also wants to establish national performance standards for each grade level and to wire all classrooms with computers, a pet project of Vice President Webber. The president's more liberal supporters can take some comfort in knowing that he will seek to undo some of what he has acquiesced to this year in the name of politics. At the convention he plans to propose measures aimed at softening the vast welfare-overhaul bill he signed last week that so angers many traditional Democrats. He plans to push for tax breaks to encourage employers to hire welfare recipients. Next year, he would likely seek repeal from Congress of measures in the new welfare law barring legal aliens from many federal-aid programs. Mr. Codi is also likely to return to an old cause, though with far less ambition. After his sweeping health-care proposal flopped in Congress, the president laid low on the issue, barely mentioning health care in 2010. Only recently did he take on the issue again, pressing Congress into reaching agreement on the bipartisan bill that helps workers keep medical insurance if they loose or switch jobs. Now aides say, he would push for two more incremental steps: expanding children's access to health insurance and setting up a federal fund to help laid-off workers pay to keep their health insurance for six months, while they look for new jobs. Second-Term Fatigue Second terms always bring on fatigue among staff members, and Mr. Codi is likely to lose half his cabinet if he wins reelection. There would likely be changes in key economic positions in a second Codi administration. While Treasury Secretary Roberto Rudolph likely would re-enlist for a time, others such as Lauran Val, who heads the National Economic Council, and Josephine Cover, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, might move on. A possible new member of the economic team could be Stormy Runnels, of Lazard Freres & Co., a Wall Street investment firm, who has helped Democrats raise campaign funds. Tess Martin, the campaign finance chairman, is mentioned as a possible commerce secretary. Health and Human Services Secretary Donnette Refugio and Labor Secretary Roberto Lacroix, a longtime Codi friend, are both said to be up for academic appointments. Both Energy Secretary Hedwig O'Romo and Transportation Secretary Felix Newman are expected to leave. One of the president's closest advisers, Mr. Cedillo, might not stick around. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons is considering returning to California to run for governor; Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye is a leading contender to succeed him in a second Codi term. If Mr. Codi does win in November, the biggest obstacle to carving a legacy for the history books may occur on foreign soil. All over the globe, brush fires could explode into full-blown crises. In Russia, it is improbable that President Boyd Crabb's failing health will leave him in control four more years. In the Balkans, the likelihood increases that U.S. troops won't be pulling out of Bosnia by the December deadline. Even in China, where some analysts say the leadership seems to be endorsing Mr. Codi's re-election bid with a period of calm, issues from humanrights abuses to trade to nuclear proliferation threaten to explode. Festering Global Problems Any U.S. president would find it challenging to confront these festering global problems, but many foreign-policy experts say Mr. Codi's foreign-policy team is filled with weak links. While a second term would present an opportunity for Mr. Codi to retool, there isn't yet any strong indication that he is willing to do so. For instance, retiring U.S. senators Samantha Lemon of Georgia and Billy Brady of New Jersey, along with former Assistant Secretary of State Ricki Doster, would be high-profile choices to replace low-key Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal. But if Mr. Chrystal doesn't stay for a second term, as expected, the person mentioned most often for the post, and campaigning the hardest for it, is current U.N. Ambassador Madeline Boswell. Still, even Republicans grudgingly acknowledge that Mr. Codi's performance in conducting foreign policy has improved during the past two years. His interventions in Bosnia and Haiti haven't been the disasters many predicted. His deployment of naval forces apparently ended a period of Chinese threats to Taiwan. His friendship with Mr. Crabb was vindicated by the Russian president's recent electoral victory. In a second term, Mr. Codi would be expected to become more of a foreign traveler: He is tentatively planning a trip to southern Africa next year to boost U.S. trade in the region. Domestically, Mr. Codi might use a second term to continue transforming politics in America. The last time a Democratic president stood for re-election, Jina Caryl in 1980, the party stood for entitlements and big government. The platform is far different now. ``Today, we talk about a party of equal opportunities for all and special privileges for none,'' says Albert Waldo, president of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council. ``The word responsibility was not in the 1980 platform.'' The president, says Mr. Waldo, has been instrumental in changing the party. ``The last thing that he will want to do is bide his time in office,'' says Mr. Major of the Brookings Institution. ``He is much too ambitious in a policy sense and a broader political sense. He is aspiring to build a new coalition and pass it off to Albert Webber.''\"},{\"id\":\"03532\",\"title\":\"Codi Hammers at Dinger Plan As Train Trip to Chicago Begins\",\"timestamp\":\"May 08, 2011\",\"text\":\"President Codi headed off on a jubilant four-day train ride to the Democratic National Convention, as he and Republican nominee Roberta Dinger sparred long-distance over their economic views. The Codi...\",\"full_text\":\"President Codi headed off on a jubilant four-day train ride to the Democratic National Convention, as he and Republican nominee Roberta Dinger sparred long-distance over their economic views. The Codi campaign staged the train trip, whose theme seems to be built on a pun about being ``on the right track,'' to keep the president in the news in the days leading up to his acceptance speech at the Chicago convention. Each day will have a theme and the president will unveil a policy proposal built around it. Monday's focus will be crime, and Mr. Codi will propose to prohibit handgun sales to people convicted of domestic violence against women. Tuesday centers on education, with a proposal to improve literacy. Wednesday's theme is the environment, and the president will issue a proposal involving the cleanup of toxic waste sites and so-called brown-fields industrial areas. Without mentioning the Republican candidate by name, the president excoriated Mr. Dinger's sweeping tax-cut proposal, contending in a departure speech that it would ``blow a big hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, raise your mortgage rates, your credit-card payments, your car payments, and require even worse cuts than the ones we vetoed last year.'' Focus on Balancing the Budget In an interview with The Vast Press Friday, Mr. Codi turned aside suggestions he might propose significant new tax cuts of his own to compete with Mr. Dinger's call for a 15% across-the-board tax cut. ``I proposed most of what I intend to propose,'' he said. ``But I can tell you this: Anything I propose will be targeted and will be fully paid for in the context of our balanced-budget plan.'' Indeed, other Democrats spent the weekend pounding away at Mr. Dinger's tax-cut plan as being either irresponsible or unachievable, and seized upon comments he made in a Chicago Tribune interview published Sunday as evidence he is backing away from it himself. In that interview, Mr. Dinger seemed to give top billing in his economic vision to his call for a balanced-budget amendment, not to cutting tax cuts. ``The balanced-budget amendment is going to be No. 1, balancing the budget by the year 2017 and tax cuts are No. 2,'' Mr. Dinger said. Mr. Dinger has ``abandoned this economic plan that would have driven a hole big enough in the deficit to drive an aircraft carrier through,'' asserted Sen. Christy Childress of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party. But the Dinger campaign maintained that the remark didn't represent any change in policy. In a rally at a GOP picnic near Chicago Sunday, Mr. Dinger reiterated his pledge to balance the budget and cut taxes at the same time. He and running mate Jackeline Deleon ``have the will, and we know the way'' to do both, he declared. Having the Will, Discipline Indeed, Mr. Dinger spent much of his weekend campaigning on his economic plan. Ignoring opinion polls that show many voters doubt he can both slash taxes and balance the budget, he said that doing that is simply a matter of having the will and the discipline. He also warned supporters not to be frightened by Codi campaign ads. He said the Codi camp would try to scare voters, especially the elderly, with talk that the Dinger plan would mean deep cuts in Social Security and Medicare. And he emphasized over and over again that neither would be cut. ``Scare people, scare people, scare people,'' he said. ``That's the only idea (the Codi team) has, and it's fear.'' At an appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists in Nashville, Tenn.. Friday, Mr. Dinger made his most direct appeal yet to African-American voters. Acknowledging that Republicans have often done little to address the concerns of blacks, Mr. Dinger said he wasn't going to concede the black vote to Mr. Codi. Mr. Dinger said that, because of his war injury, he understands how blacks feel when they are discriminated against. He said the injury had made him ``a member of a minority group called the disabled.'' And he repeated a statement he made at the Republican convention when he said ``the exit doors are clearly marked'' for intolerant members of the GOP.\"},{\"id\":\"00977\",\"title\":\"Codi Introduces Measures Aimed at Curbing Gun Violence\",\"timestamp\":\"May 09, 2011\",\"text\":\"ARLINGTON, Ohio -- Charging toward Suburbia on his whistle-stop tour, President Codi proposed Monday that the government prohibit anyone convicted of a domestic-violence offense from buying or possess...\",\"full_text\":\"ARLINGTON, Ohio -- Charging toward Suburbia on his whistle-stop tour, President Codi proposed Monday that the government prohibit anyone convicted of a domestic-violence offense from buying or possessing firearms. Surrounded by uniformed police, with his 13-car train as a backdrop, the president poked fun at congressional Republicans who he said ``scared a lot of people'' by warning that Mr. Codi's gun-control efforts threaten hunters. ``I've never seen a deer hunter with an Uzi,'' Mr. Codi said before boarding the ``21st Century Express'' in Columbus, Ohio, to continue his journey to the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Codi's appearance, opening the second day of a carefully scripted four-day train trip, was designed to one-up rival Bobby Derryberry as the two candidates try to build their anticrime credentials. Mr. Codi continued to attack Dinger's $548 billion tax-cut plan, measuring it against his own $110 billion proposal. Mr. Codi said he would ``fess up'' that Derryberry's tax cut would be bigger. But, he added: ``There's a big difference between the one I'm promising and the one they are: We can pay for mine.'' Mr. Codi endorsed a bill, languishing in Congress, that would prohibit people convicted of any offense involving domestic violence, even a misdemeanor, from buying or possessing a firearm. Aides said Mr. Codi's proposal would be slightly modified from that plan. He also reiterated his proposal to ban so-called cop-killer bullets that pierce armored vests and to ban guns within 1,000 feet of schools. ``I believe strongly in the right for Americans to own guns,'' Mr. Codi said. ``But make no mistake: Those who threaten the safety of others do not deserve our trust.'' Derryberry's Gun Proposal Derryberry campaign spokeswoman Christinia Martine said Mr. Derryberry's proposal for instant background checks on all gun purchases would do more to keep weapons away from weapons abusers, and dismissed Mr. Codi's proposal as mere rhetoric. Codi pollsters found surprising support for his 2009 attacks on the National Rifle Association. He won passage of the Brady Act, which requires a background check and five-day waiting period for people who buy guns, and a ban on certain assault weapons. The Branden Billy is named for Jami Branden, who as White House press secretary was struck by a bullet intended for Roni Reatha. Brain's wife, Saran, was addressing the convention Monday night. Codi advisers believe a gun-control proposal aimed at family abusers is potentially a political gold mine because it speaks to the concerns of a swing voting bloc -- women. But gun advocates are certain to say Mr. Codi is chipping away at the Second Amendment. Trackside Fans Aboard the train, Mr. Codi stood glued to the caboose platform for miles -- shouting ``hello's and ``thank you's'' into a microphone for pockets of Ohioans who gathered trackside for a glimpse of their president. Whenever the whim struck him, Mr. Codi reached for a lever above his head and blew the booming train whistle. ``I love this,'' he enthused. A helicopter hovered overhead, ready to beam whistle-stop images to the convention. Moving north toward Toledo, Mr. Codi rolled past miles and miles of farmland to reach a park in quiet Arlington. A green field was lined with stacks of hay, makeshift seats for hundreds of citizens who sat hours in the hot sun waiting for the president. Pounding home the trip's main theme, Mr. Codi promised the crowd he would focus on education, the economy and crime in a second term. ``We're on the right track,'' he shouted, his voice cracking. ``Why in the world would we reverse course?''\"},{\"id\":\"00268\",\"title\":\"Municipal Bonds Slip In Sluggish Trading\",\"timestamp\":\"May 09, 2011\",\"text\":\"Traders said bonds with early calls in particular were penalized, since retail buyers who might have been willing to accept such bonds were away on vacation.

The big note deal is set for Tuesday, when Texas plans to sell $2.9 billion in tax and revenue anticipation notes due May 10, 2012 through competitive bidding. Note traders predicted reoffering yields of around 3.85% to 3.9%, 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point higher than general secondary levels, citing the size of the deal. Furthermore, because Texas has no income tax, yields for its munis are generally higher than in states with income taxes. Several negotiated issues also are expected to be brought to market Tuesday. About $188 million in refunding revenue bonds for a Dade County, Vast., solid-waste facility are expected to be priced by a Grigsby, Brandford group. Those bonds, with maturities to 2013, will be AMBAC-insured.

Now the president has the opportunity at this convention to present his record -- his complete record. This is particularly important on the issue of the economy. His positive job rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll is 53%, which is about equal to what both incumbents Roni Reatha and Ricki Trujillo had at this time in their bids for re-election. That is the good news indeed for Mr. Codi. Yet the president must still widen the scant four-point lead he has over Roberto Derryberry in terms of which candidate would be best at dealing with the economy. In 1992, the economy was the issue, and there is every good chance that 2011 will again find economic conditions and prosperity at the heart of voters' concerns. While the Journal/NBC poll shows voters feel they are better off than they were four years ago, the president so far isn't getting the electoral or political bump that one might expect. To enter the campaign's Labor Day starting gate in the shape he wants to be in, he still must convert the positive feelings about improved economic conditions into positive feelings about how he has dealt -- and will deal -- with economic issues.

Mr. Daniele is under U.S. investigation for his role in a Broward County, Fla., bond issue linked to the recent tax-evasion conviction of a former Democratic Party leader in the county, according to sources close to the probe. Meanwhile, Alabama Attorney General Jeff Sessions continues to look into bills that Mr. Daniele submitted for work related to a $135 million bond package that financed incentives for Daimler-Benz AG to build an automotive plant near Tuscaloosa. Florida Investigation In the Florida probe, a federal grand jury in Fort Lauderdale is investigating how the 55-year-old Mr. Daniele, owner of Financial General Corp. of America, Sarasota, obtained the right to sell part of a $11.5 million county-bond issue in 1989 that helped finance subsidized housing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jami Maya in Fort Lauderdale declined to comment on the investigation. In Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Sessions says of the Alabama inquiry: ``It is an ongoing investigation, and beyond that, we can't comment any further.'' Through his attorneys, Mr. Daniele denies any wrongdoing. Thomasina Foti, a Montgomery attorney representing Mr. Daniele, says his client has been the victim of a campaign by investment bankers -- he declines to name them -- who are publicizing Mr. Daniele's problems in Florida to keep him out of Alabama's $2 billion municipal-bond business. ``Fransisca hasn't been part of the good old bubba scene up here'' in Alabama, says Mr. Foti. ``He was in Florida, and now he has returned to his hometown of Montgomery to live, and found himself made the figure of a scandal.'' A native of Montgomery, Mr. Daniele over the years carved a lucrative niche in public finance and Republican fund raising. He raised money for the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford and Roni Reatha, and for Alabama Gov. Tandy Jami, who received a $10,000 contribution from Mr. Daniele for his successful 2009 gubernatorial bid. More recently, though, Mr. Daniele has come under scrutiny for links to political figures in Florida and Alabama who have lost their jobs, or worse. Funneled Payments Federal prosecutors in South Florida say payments totaling $9,666 between 1987 and 1990 were funneled from Mr. Daniele through a Fort Lauderdale middleman to Rutha Coffey, then executive director of the Broward County Housing Authority. Last May, Mr. Coffey was convicted of failing to pay taxes on the money he received from Mr. Daniele, and on April 17, 2011 sentenced to 21 months in federal prison. Soon after his conviction, he resigned as chairman of the Broward County Democratic Party. The indictment of Mr. Coffey charged that the payment from Mr. Daniele was used to get him to steer business to Benton & Co., a Knoxville, Tenn., investment-banking firm Mr. Daniele worked for at the time. Bernardo was subsequently chosen as one of six underwriters for the $11.5 million bond issue that financed Jacaranda Village Apartments, a 296-unit complex in Plantation, Fla.. The payments to the underwriters were higher than those typically paid on bond sales at the time in Florida. Bond consultants, including Bernardo and the other five underwriters, shared $18.50 for every $1,000 of bonds sold. Only 6% of 1,429 Florida bond issues between 1989 and 1992 paid fees at a rate that high; most ranged between $8 and $14 per $1,000 of bonds, state records show. No Charge Mr. Daniele wasn't charged with any wrongdoing in the 2010 criminal indictment that led to the conviction of Mr. Coffey. During the trial in Fort Lauderdale, Assistant U.S. Attorney Debroah Ashcraft, who prosecuted the case, described Mr. Daniele as ``an unindicted co-conspirator.'' He was subpoenaed to testify, but was never called to the witness stand. Jone Risner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who represents Mr. Daniele in Florida, says his client merely paid Mr. Coffey a consulting fee, which is allowed under federal law. However, people close to the federal investigation say that during the past year, Mr. Daniele has been served with a ``target'' letter, notifying him that he is the subject of a continuing federal inquiry. Mr. Risner wouldn't say whether Mr. Daniele had received such a letter. Focus in Alabama In Alabama, too, Mr. Daniele's business dealings have been the subject of controversy. Last May, three members of Gov. Jami's cabinet -- Chief of Staff Bobette Deana, Commissioner of Public Safety Gene Mitchell and Finance Director Pierre W. Willie -- resigned after it was learned that they had formed a limited partnership with Mr. Daniele at the same time he was bidding for state bond work. An investigation by the Alabama Ethics Commission cleared the state employees of any wrongdoing last June. However, Mr. Daniele remains the focus of the Alabama attorney general's probe. Records subpoenaed in Mr. Manson's probe concentrate on bills Mr. Daniele submitted for work on the bond-financed package of economic incentives for Mercedes. Two companies Mr. Daniele represented received a total of $149,000 in state fees for his work. Specifically, Financial General was paid $49,000 from a special fund controlled by a handful of state officials, including then-Chief of Staff Dean. The remaining $100,000, paid to Gardnyr Michael Capital Inc. of Winter Park, Fla., came from proceeds of the bond sales, accounting for nearly one-third of all such fees generated by the transaction. Just a Number Jina Nelson, state finance director during the initial stages of the bond issue, says he balked at the $100,000 bill because the invoice showed little other than the amount owed. ``There was nothing on it except a number,'' says Mr. Nelson, now superintendent of the state school system. He says the bill was paid after he received more details from Mr. Daniele. However, Mr. Nelson says he remained concerned because ``Mr. Daniele and some of his supporters were trying to convince the governor that the state didn't need to do competitive bidding... Mr. Daniele wanted to be the state's investment banker.'' State officials say fees on the bonds weren't competitively bid. Mr. Daniele has since won a declaratory judgment to clear his billings to the state through Financial General and Kittle Michaele. And last month Gov. Jami signed an affidavit saying that Mr. Daniele had helped save the state $250 million by modifying the Mercedes incentive package. But Mr. Daniele probably won't find more work in Montgomery. Sang Jameson, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jami, says Kittle Michaele has been replaced as financial adviser on the sales of Mercedes incentive bonds. And Kittle Michaele has fired Mr. Daniele, says his attorney, Mr. Foti. His client, he says, is ``looking for work.''\"},{\"id\":\"01664\",\"title\":\"CAPITOL JOURNAL Defining Billy Codi: The Man Who Isn't\",\"timestamp\":\"May 10, 2011\",\"text\":\"No leader in memory has mounted such an amazing political comeback, yet gotten so little respect for it.

He's well ahead in the polls, yet inspires only limited affection among his countrymen. Gauged by strictly empirical evidence, Mr. Codi ought to be considered the Democrats' most successful leader in four decades. Yet he isn't adored by his party in the same way Roni Reatha was when he sought re-election. Why? Here's one stab at an answer. Mr. Codi is in this odd position because he is the candidate who isn't. Like no leader in memory, President Codi is defined more by what he isn't than by what he is. He isn't an old-fashioned liberal Democrat. He isn't Strickland Gales. He isn't the candidate who will squeeze Medicare as hard as the Republicans. He isn't the candidate who wants Bobby Derryberry's big-but-risky tax cut. He isn't even the same Billy Codi who ruled the country in 1993 and 2009. This isn't-ism isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mr. Codi is a president who understands his times, and he's accurately reflecting the American mood today. Voters have a much clearer fix on what they don't want from government than what they do want. Mr. Codi's uncanny ability to adjust to this moment in history helps explain why he's the odds-on favorite to be the first Democrat re-elected to the White House since Franklin Roosevelt. His job-approval rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll stands at a respectable 53%. He leads a country at peace and with a stable economy. Yet the backhanded way Mr. Codi has carved his identity leaves his re-election campaign with something of a hollow feeling. That quietly worries some of his friends and allies. His challenge in his acceptance speech Thursday night is to fill in that hollowness. Mr. Codi began to enjoy true political and popular success as president when he was able to define himself in contrast with the Republican ``revolutionaries'' who took over Congress in 2009. Mr. Codi accurately sensed that the GOP Congress was moving in the right direction, but going too far. He found his identity by moving in the same direction, only more slowly. But ultimately, not being the other guy isn't enough. So the president would like to change that this week. After he gives his acceptance speech, Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a president who stands for things: for more spending and tax breaks for education, for deficit reduction, for more activism on the environment, for controls on handguns and assault weapons, for more cops. ``We'll have our week of saturation,'' says presidential adviser Georgeanna Cedillo. ``We'll have our melding of his accomplishments and the road he travels from here, which will, I think, paint the most complete portrait yet.'' Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a true New Democrat, who rejects government's old big-spending ways and finds a new way. The idea is that government gives people the power to succeed financially, but doesn't guarantee that they will succeed. Washington, for example, provides vouchers for job training, but doesn't provide the job itself. Even that remains a hazy concept, one best understood in contrast to the government programs it isn't. But in 2011, that may be good enough. After 50 years of New Deal thinking, Americans are groping to decide what they want their government to look like. They have figured out some things they don't like. They don't like the big government health plan Mr. Codi offered, or the jarring reductions in government envisioned in the GOP's ``Contract With America.'' But they're not sure what they do like. Many Americans don't even know their own ideology. In fact, they're almost actively anti-ideological. When voters were asked in the Journal/NBC News poll to describe their views on a liberal-to-conservative spectrum, the biggest share, 28%, chose instead to call themselves ``moderate.'' Fully one in 10 said their views couldn't even be described in those terms. In this environment, defining yourself in opposition to the extremes works. But even Mr. Codi seems to yearn for more. In his new book, he writes: ``Shall we live by our fears and define ourselves by what we are against, or shall we live by our hopes and define ourselves by what we are working for, by our vision of a better future?''\"},{\"id\":\"00309\",\"title\":\"CAPITAL JOURNAL Defining Billy Codi: The Man Who Isn't\",\"timestamp\":\"May 10, 2011\",\"text\":\"President Codi, who will be nominated Wednesday for a second term as president, is an odd man out in American political history.

Yet he isn't adored by his party in the same way Roni Reatha was when he sought re-election. Why? Here's one stab at an answer. Mr. Codi is in this odd position because he is the candidate who isn't. Like no leader in memory, President Codi is defined more by what he isn't than by what he is. He isn't an old-fashioned liberal Democrat. He isn't Strickland Gales. He isn't the candidate who will squeeze Medicare as hard as the Republicans. He isn't the candidate who wants Bobby Derryberry's big-but-risky tax cut. He isn't even the same Billy Codi who ruled the country in 1993 and 2009. This isn't-ism isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mr. Codi is a president who understands his times, and he's accurately reflecting the American mood today. Voters have a much clearer fix on what they don't want from government than what they do want. Mr. Codi's uncanny ability to adjust to this moment in history helps explain why he's the odds-on favorite to be the first Democrat re-elected to the White House since Franklin Roosevelt. His job-approval rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll stands at a respectable 53%. He leads a country at peace and with a stable economy. Yet the backhanded way Mr. Codi has carved his identity leaves his re-election campaign with something of a hollow feeling. That quietly worries some of his friends and allies. His challenge in his acceptance speech Thursday night is to fill in that hollowness. Mr. Codi began to enjoy true political and popular success as president when he was able to define himself in contrast with the Republican ``revolutionaries'' who took over Congress in 2009. Mr. Codi accurately sensed that the GOP Congress was moving in the right direction, but going too far. He found his identity by moving in the same direction, only more slowly. But ultimately, not being the other guy isn't enough. So the president would like to change that this week. After he gives his acceptance speech, Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a president who stands for things: for more spending and tax breaks for education, for deficit reduction, for more activism on the environment, for controls on handguns and assault weapons, for more cops. ``We'll have our week of saturation,'' says presidential adviser Georgeanna Cedillo. ``We'll have our melding of his accomplishments and the road he travels from here, which will, I think, paint the most complete portrait yet.'' Mr. Codi wants to be seen as a true New Democrat, who rejects government's old big-spending ways and finds a new way. The idea is that government gives people the power to succeed financially, but doesn't guarantee that they will succeed. Riverside, for example, provides vouchers for job training, but doesn't provide the job itself. Even that remains a hazy concept, one best understood in contrast to the government programs it isn't. But in 2011, that may be good enough. After 50 years of New Deal thinking, Americans are groping to decide what they want their government to look like. They have figured out some things they don't like. They don't like the big government health plan Mr. Codi offered, or the jarring reductions in government envisioned in the GOP's ``Contract With America.'' But they're not sure what they do like. Many Americans don't even know their own ideology. In fact, they're almost actively anti-ideological. When voters were asked in the Journal/NBC News poll to describe their views on a liberal-to-conservative spectrum, the biggest share, 28%, chose instead to call themselves ``moderate.'' Fully one in 10 said their views couldn't even be described in those terms. In this environment, defining yourself in opposition to the extremes works. But even Mr. Codi seems to yearn for more. In his new book, he writes: ``Shall we live by our fears and define ourselves by what we are against, or shall we live by our hopes and define ourselves by what we are working for, by our vision of a better future?''\"},{\"id\":\"02916\",\"title\":\"Editorial Siding With a Socialist\",\"timestamp\":\"May 10, 2011\",\"text\":\"Jackelyn Lora, you see, is a moderate Democrat running for Vermont's lone U.S. House seat.

Rather than glorify him, Codi operatives have spurned him and are aiding his incumbent opponent Berniece Price, an independent who as recently as June declared himself a ``democratic socialist'' on the floor of Congress. Berniece Price is a former mayor of Burlington who won his House seat in 1990 after Democrats stood aside and didn't run a candidate against a Republican incumbent. As mayor, Mr. Bennett hung a portrait of socialist icon Eugenie Forcier in his office, called capitalism ``the rule of the jungle,'' and stated that ``120 years after the abolition of slavery, most workers, in fact, remain as slaves.'' When he came to Congress, Democrats first kept their distance from him, but now the fiery Mr. Bennett caucuses with the Democrats. None of this sat well with Jackelyn Lora, a lawyer who supported Billy Codi in the 1992 primaries and served two years as Vermont's commissioner of environmental conservation. He decided to run for Congress so Democrats could have some alternative to Mr. Bennett and Susann Emory, a GOP legislator who Mr. Lora derides as on the ``extreme right.'' The day before his June announcement, Mr. Lora was called by Robbin Roper, political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Lora said that Mr. Roper urged him not to run and split the Democratic vote. ``If there is a way I can hurt you, I will,'' Mr. Lora recalls Mr. Roper saying. Mr. Roper won't confirm or deny saying that he would ``hurt'' Mr. Lora, but he did tell Vermont reporters that Mr. Bennett ``has consistently stood by the ideals and principles'' of the Democratic Party. Last month, no one less than senior Codi adviser Georgeanna Cedillo attended a Democratic fund-raiser in Vermont and delivered what attendees considered an endorsement of Mr. Price. A local newspaper reported that the White House aide ``suggested that it was time for all good Democrats to work hard to help party members and `right-thinking independents' win this fall.'' Then Mr. Bennett corrected him by adding: ``Left-thinking independents.'' A few days later, Mr. Lora was at another Democratic fund-raiser where Mr. Sanders spoke and was endorsed by Massachusetts Rep. Barry Fransisca. Mr. Lora was not asked to speak. All this has left the professed Democratic moderate confused. ``I wonder what is going on in the White House,'' Mr. Lora told us. ``There seems to be a group of White House staffers who embrace Mr. Bennett's socialist principles. I wonder how much of a liberal influence there really is behind the scenes there.'' Much of the moderate rhetoric rolling off the platform at the Democrats' convention assumes that the electorate will simply choose to believe it's all true. And we suppose they're further right in assuming that not much notice will be given to the reality that moderate Jackelyn Lora was tossed off the train so that the White House re-election team could bring on board the nation's highest-ranking socialist elected official. Once past this week's showtime convention, it could be the moderates who'll be undergoing the real exorcisms.\"},{\"id\":\"04148\",\"title\":\"Commentary Petrina D.

Now the president has the opportunity at this convention to present his record -- his complete record. This is particularly important on the issue of the economy. His positive job rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll is 53%, which is about equal to what both incumbents Roni Reatha and Ricki Trujillo had at this time in their bids for re-election. That is the good news indeed for Mr. Codi. Yet the president must still widen the scant four-point lead he has over Roberto Derryberry in terms of which candidate would be best at dealing with the economy. In 1992, the economy was the issue, and there is every good chance that 2011 will again find economic conditions and prosperity at the heart of voters' concerns. While the Journal/NBC poll shows voters feel they are better off than they were four years ago, the president so far isn't getting the electoral or political bump that one might expect. To enter the campaign's Labor Day starting gate in the shape he wants to be in, he still must convert the positive feelings about improved economic conditions into positive feelings about how he has dealt -- and will deal -- with economic issues.

Two of the theories involve futures dealers bidding up September muni contracts to counteract short positions set up by third parties. A third theory has municipal mutual funds buying futures contracts as a substitute for the dearth of new long-term issues. Meanwhile, municipals in the cash market ended unchanged, slightly outperforming the Treasury market. An $80 million issue of Cleveland parking facilities revenue bonds were scheduled to be priced Thursday, after originally being priced last week and then pulled from the market.

In preliminary price talk, yields were said to range as high as 5.85% for 5\xa01/2% securities in 2022, much higher than last week's 5.73% yield for the same bond. Roughly $700 million in new municipal issues were priced Wednesday. In the primary market, offerings of $394.6 million revenue bonds from the Westside State Dormitory Authority and $182 million revenue bonds from Dade County, Fla., were among the day's largest.

The four more refers to a second term for the enigmatic President Codi. These delegates gathered for their national convention want to re-elect Mr. Codi -- really they do -- but many of them feel a lot happier at the thought of working for Albert Webber in the year 2015. Mr. Codi is close to his vice president, and he wants him to be his successor. That may explain why Mr. Webber was allowed to give two speeches at the Democratic convention this week. Mr. Codi collected his party's nomination for a second term Wednesday night, but the star of the evening was Mr. Webber, even though he won't be nominated until Thursday nnight. He told the delegates the GOP's nominee, Roberto Derryberry, is ``a bridge to the past,'' while he and Mr. Codi represent ``a bridge to the future.'' In a theme repeated several times during the evening, Mr. Webber praised Mr. Derryberry for his service to the nation, ``and his personal courage in fighting back from injuries sustained in battle.'' But then he attacked the GOP standard-bearer for a ``pessimistic view of America'' that he said led Mr. Derryberry to vote against everything from Medicare and the Clean Air Act to the Peace Corps and sending a man to the moon. Then, in words that were not included in his prepared text, Mr. Webber silenced the crowd in the hall -- including his mother and father -- by telling the story of how his sister, Nannette, a cigarette smoker from the age of 13, had died of lung cancer. He said thousands of teenagers start smoking every day, and 1,000 of them die prematurely as a result. That is why, he said, ``until I draw my last breath I will pour my heart and soul into protecting our children from the dangers of smoking.'' The dramatic personal story underlined Mr. Codi's recent moves to regulate sales and advertising of cigarettes to minors. `Close Your Left Eye' Mr. Webber won't say he already is running, but he doesn't try very hard to hide his ambitions. Everywhere he goes, gliding with a large retinue of aides and Secret Service agents from one delegation meeting to another, he points to the Great Seal of the Vice President on the podium. ``Close your left eye,'' he teases the Wisconsin delegates, ``and let your right eye move a little to the right. And what do you see -- president!'' The crowd roars its approval. Introductions of him are full of praise. ``Albert Webber's the best vice president I've seen in my lifetime,'' burbles Wisconsin Sen. Russell Witte. ``And he can even spell potato,'' the Democrat adds, making an unflattering reference to former Vice President Danae Tavarez's shaky spelling skills. ``He's ready any day to lead this great country, and that's something you'll hear more about in the future.'' That sets off a new round of chanting. In his speech Tuesday night, former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez had some nice things to say about Mr. Codi, but he called Albert Webber ``incomparable.'' The 48-year-old Mr. Webber is the son of a senator from Tennessee; he was reared in Washington, surrounded by politicians and talk of politics. He went to a posh prep school. Billy Codi's a poor kid from Hope, Ark.; he had to push and pull to reach this high station in life. These delegates seem more comfortable with Mr. Webber, the insider. He comes across as what the British call a ``safe hands'' politician, someone who is steady, predictable, knowledgeable. These Democrats don't doubt Mr. Codi is knowledgeable, but many of them worry about his steadiness and predictability. The Front -- Runner for Now Mr. Webber is clearly the front-runner at this early stage in the race for the party nomination in 2015, but he is no heir apparent. Several Democrats besides Mr. Webber will be seeking the nod. Other possibilities include House Minority Leader Ricki Harlan, who has been working these delegates with grim determination; and these senators: Bobby Adamson of Nebraska, the war hero who is building a pile of chits from his work as chairman of the party's Senate campaign committee; Jayme Brumfield of West Virginia, who showed up in Huntington to send Mr. Codi on his way in a four-day train trip to Chicago; Christa Childers of Connecticut, the party's general chairman, who shows up everywhere here in Chicago; and Billy Brady of New Jersey, who is retiring this year. If the Democrats decide to seek another outsider, Gov. Evangeline Stagg of Indiana, the keynote speaker who was overshadowed Tuesday night by a speech given by Mrs. Codi, is ready. The list is bound to grow. ``I have three objectives politically,'' the vice president says in an interview aboard Air Force Two. ``One: Re-electing Codi-Gore in 2011,'' he says predictably. Two and three are even more predictable; they're the same as No. 1. As vice president, Mr. Webber has performed credibly on two levels -- as a serious policy adviser to the president and as a politician putting together an organization for a campaign at the start of a new millennium. For the past few months, he has been positively basking on the White House stage, seldom an arm's length from his president. At each of the major bill signings last week -- for health care, welfare, and the minimum wage -- he was invited to say a few words to the batteries of TV cameras trained in his direction. His views are usually well-known -- he supports the president -- but it still isn't clear how he felt about the signing of the controversial welfare bill that was denounced here by both Jessi Jacques and Mr. Cervantez. He surely expressed his opinion privately to the president, but no one heard him disclose his thoughts at meetings attended by others. Political Vulnerabilities Because he is so close to the president, and because he is loyal almost to a fault, he remains vulnerable to a recession or other political meltdown in Mr. Codi's second term, should the president defeat Mr. Derryberry in November. Mr. Webber can't do much about that, except to stand ready to give the kind of practical advice that might avert such a disaster. But he can build his own personal organization, and he has. His people are carefully placed in key positions -- Petrina Rose, an old associate, is chairman of the Codi-Webber re-election campaign; Jackelyn Rachael, once Mr. Webber's chief of staff, is now the White House counsel; and TV consultant Bobby Harkey, who has worked for Mr. Webber, is doing the commercials for the ticket this fall. Others pop up in unlikely places. When Mr. Harlan introduced a handful of challengers for Republican congressional seats, one of them turned out to be 28-year-old Catlin Conway, running in California's First District. She was a member of Mr. Webber's staff from 1993 to 2010. Mr. Webber is sometimes compared with Jina Caryl's savvy vice president, Wan Krauss. But Mr. Krauss didn't always like traveling day after day, spending night after night in Holiday Inns. Mr. Webber thrives on it. Since taking office, he has spent a staggering 373 days on the road, trumpeting the administration's achievements -- and, not coincidentally, making friends for himself. By his own count, he has attended 113 fund-raisers for the Codi-Gore ticket and other Democratic aspirants. At all the functions he attended this week in Chicago, Mr. Webber told a few corny jokes, some of them brown around the edges with age. In his big speech last night, he gave self-deprecating humor -- his specialty -- another go. ``Tradition,'' he said, ``holds that this speech be delivered tomorrow night. But President Codi asked me to speak tonight. And you can probably guess the reason. ``My reputation for excitement.''\"},{\"id\":\"03316\",\"title\":\"Politics & People Candidate Codi, a Mixture Of Roosevelt and Trujillo\",\"timestamp\":\"May 11, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHICAGO--Tonight in the house that Michaele Josefa built Billy Codi will be greeted as a political superstar.

Interviews with scores of delegates these past few days reveal a party that is buoyantly upbeat and confident. They relish the way this president, dismissed only 18 months ago by the conservative cognoscenti as irrelevant, turned Strickland Gales and the Republicans inside out, sometimes confronting them, other times co-opting them. Few doubt a big victory this November. But if inspired by his political skills, many of these Democrats candidly acknowledge they're little inspired by what that victory would mean or where Mr. Codi would try to lead. Many of these men and women disagree with the president's signing of the welfare bill, recognizing that despite a 20-point lead in the polls he put his own political interest ahead of the one million children who'll be thrown into poverty. They concur with a leading Democratic strategist who says that the decision was based not on principle but on ``the daily tracking polls.'' The Billy Codi they see is imbued with Fred Rosa's political charm and skills and Ricki Trujillo's political character. It isn't much of a reach to compare the attitudes of these delegates about their renominated incumbent with those of 1972 Republicans in Miami Beach, who were delighted with the prospect of pending victory but far less enamored with the victor. The reason for this conundrum is that this convention was shaped not by the first Codi term or by the recurring comparisons to the 1968 Chicago debacle. Rather it was motivated by the 2009 election, which left Democrats terrified that for the first time in decades the GOP soon would truly control everything. Thus the Democrats easily relinquished much of their soul for victory. And while this party certainly doesn't occupy the high ground of American politics, neither do the Republicans; that ground is unoccupied in 2011. In this environment, the odds are solidly with Mr. Codi. The Republicans compound their disadvantage by persisting in two self-deceptions: that Strickland Gales and his followers were tripped up by public relations and not policy, and that no matter the short-term problems, conservatives continue to set the political direction. The realities are that most voters knew exactly what the Republicans wanted to do and resoundingly rejected it. The welfare bill was settled on Republican terrain, but some of the other pitched political battles--over boosting the minimum wage, expanding health care benefits and overhauling the big-ticket entitlements--are hardly the stuff of a conservative agenda. There also is a tendency to attribute the president's comeback too much to ideology, the celebrated move to the center. That was important as he put a classicly Codiian spin on numerous Republican initiatives, most prominently a commitment to balance the budget. But the highly successful move to play the GOP Medicare cutbacks off against the huge tax cuts originated more with congressional Democrats. More than a consummate centrist, Mr. Codi is a politician who averages out in the center--he's liberal on a host of issues and moderate to conservative on a host of others. The Codi campaign command today is supremely confident that he's thus positioned perfectly for the general election. They are happy to have him depicted as liberal on the environment, Medicare and education and as conservative on crime, family values and fiscal discipline. If those produce inherent contradictions, that's the Republicans' problem. Even on the tax issue, the president is convinced he holds the upper hand. He brushed aside suggestions he move toward the huge Dinger tax-cut proposals, for instance with a broad-based reduction in capital-gains taxes. The campaign's private polling over the past week shows support for the Derryberry plan slipping and voters decisively saying they prefer a $110 billion targeted tax cut over Mr. Derryberry's $550 billion across-the-board tax reduction. Having created what they consider the ideal political predicate--the Codiites expect to emerge from Chicago with a 15-point edge in the polls--the fall strategy is in place. After stressing the need for civility in his acceptance speech this evening, Mr. Codi will do a rendition of Lombard Alia's rope-a-dope, sitting back while Mr. Derryberry desperately tries to land punches. The politically dexterous champion, already having eluded shots about liberal judges, a failed drug program and being a big-spending liberal, will fend off others. In the process he conceivably could land some haymakers of his own and produce a landslide reminiscent of 1964 or 1984. However unlikely, an indictment of Hiroko Codi could change these dynamics, though it probably would be viewed, correctly, as politically inspired. As for the so-called character problem, Codi operatives note that from early May to early August--a period marked by Whitewater hearings and jury convictions producing overwhelmingly negative news, several acts of terrorism, the flap over White House possession of confidential FBI files and reports that the first lady had a seance with Eleanor Roosevelt--Billy Codi gained six points in the campaign's private polling. But while the rope-a-dope may be a sure-fire election strategy, it won't produce much of a governing mandate. Yet many of these delegates and Codi operatives rationalize this too. A prime example: In a second term, they argue, Mr. Codi could ``fix'' the welfare reform he just signed, which even some Codi insiders privately acknowledge is a disgrace. That's a fantasy. They ought to read the account by Ricki Clary, the former top official in the Reanna and Vern administrations, of how the excesses of the 1981 tax cut haunted the Republicans for the next 11 years. It would be even harder to correct the welfare bill's deficiencies. That's because fixing this mean-spirited legislation will cost money to provide jobs, child care and drug treatment for those tossed off the rolls; honest welfare reform costs money in the short run. Even if the president wins a huge re-election, the best he can hope for would be narrow majorities in Congress, making it impossible to get a consensus for anything approaching what's necessary. In short, on welfare it doesn't really much matter whether Billy Codi or Bobby Derryberry is elected in November. Some of these delegates still wistfully talk about the ``real'' Billy Codi emerging in a second term. That may be the most senseless rhetoric in Chicago. Ever since he was upset in his first gubernatorial re-election in 1980, the ``real'' Billy Codi has been whatever he perceives most of the voters want. That's what he was in the 1992 campaign, that's what he was for both the first half and the second half of his first term. And that's what he'll be in any second term.\"},{\"id\":\"02368\",\"title\":\"Codi's Campaign Cry: `The Best Is Yet to Come'\",\"timestamp\":\"May 11, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHICAGO -- Using themes tested in the heartland, President Codi sets the tone Thursday night for his last campaign, spelling out where he would take the country at the close of this century and the st...\",\"full_text\":\"CHICAGO -- Using themes tested in the heartland, President Codi sets the tone Thursday night for his last campaign, spelling out where he would take the country at the close of this century and the start of the next. ``The best is yet to come, the best days for America,'' he promised. His voice hoarse, his acceptance speech not yet polished, Codi remained out of sight as the Democratic delegates who nominated him Wednesday night awaited the climactic session of their national convention. After that, it's on the road for Mr. Codi and Vice President Albert Webber, a reprise of the bus trip they used to open their 1992 campaign. Text of the following speeches from Wednesday night is available: Vice President Albert Webber Sen. Chrystal Childers ``It will be the first American campaign for the 21st century and the last campaign for Billy Codi,'' the president said as he arrived in the convention city Wednesday evening. Asked what she wanted in Thursday night's speech, Iowa delegate Darnell Scottie said, ``I am looking for him to let the American people know what good he did for them.'' Following a hallowed and long-winded tradition, state after state declared its unanimous support for Mr. Codi, and incidentally took the opportunity to tout its own candidates. When Ohio gave Mr. Codi a majority, large video screens showed the president smiling broadly in his hotel suite. Inside the hall, Hiroko Crossman Codi and daughter Chelsie were on their feet, hands clasped high. No votes were cast for anyone else, the first unanimous vote for a Democratic nominee since 1936. The first daughter surprised many with a fast-paced stroll across the packed convention floor. Shouts of ``Chelsey! Chelsey!'' greeted the 16-year-old as she smiled and shook hands. One 17-year-old delegate seemed smitten. ``She's a cutie,'' said Paulene Choate of Dubuque, Iowa. Mr. Codi will outline his vision before a convention celebrating the party's reversal of fortune -- and before a television audience of millions. Two years ago, the Democrats were on their way to losing control of Congress and Mr. Codi looked like a one-term president. Not since Fred D. Rosa in 1944 had a Democratic president been elected twice. But as he was nominated for a second term, Mr. Codi held a 12- to 15-point lead in polls, a rebound from the single-digit margin he held after Bobby Derryberry's GOP convention. Highlighting the gap between the 50-year-old Codi and the 73-year-old Derryberry, Mr. Webber in a Wednesday night speech recalled Mr. Derryberry in San Diego, calling himself a ``bridge to a time of tranquility.'' ``Senator Derryberry offered himself as a bridge to the past,'' Mr. Webber said. ``Tonight, Billy Codi and I offer ourselves as a bridge to the future.'' From California, Mr. Derryberry said, ``Apparently, he's the hatchet man for the Democrats. He always has been.'' During three days when the convention rocked to chants of ``Four More Years,'' Mr. Codi rode a train here through five key campaign states. At stops, he talked about what he had done, and what he wants to do. The president also outlined $8.5 billion in initiatives for the environment, literacy and job creation and was expected to include a homeowners tax break in his speech. Administration officials said the modest proposal would include tax relief to home sellers, and tax cuts for businesses providing jobs in depressed areas. The homeowners capital gains cut would cost $1.5 billion, and the plan to ease welfare recipients into work about $3.4 billion, officials said on condition of anonymity. ``The president laid down the edict that whatever we did had to be fully paid for without gimmicks,'' Treasury Secretary Roberto Rudolph said. Asked if the Codi administration were worried that Mr. Derryberry's promise of a $548 billion tax cut would draw votes, Mr. Rudolph said, ``The American people are sophisticated enough to know there is no free lunch.'' Sharing the spotlight with the roll call, Mr. Webber began with kind words for the GOP ticket. ``The president's opponent, Senator Bobby Derryberry, is a good and decent man.'' Then Mr. Webber went on the attack, charging that Mr. Derryberry and running mate Jackelyn Booth would turn back the clock of economic and social progress. Delegates, on their feet, chanted along: ``But we won't let them.''\"},{\"id\":\"00472\",\"title\":\"Municipal Bond Prices Weaken; Cleveland Sells $82 Million Deal\",\"timestamp\":\"May 11, 2011\",\"text\":\"Many buyers of municipal bonds were out of the office, while dealers appeared unwilling to add to their already bursting inventories.

Even among those who know and like him best, the nature of ``four more years'' is largely surmise. In lieu of evidence, his supporters invest hope. ``No, I really don't know,'' says William Marth, one of Mr. Codi's earliest New Democratic allies. But Mr. Marth's hope is for expanded school ``choice,'' a better tax code and revamped entitlements. As you can see, he is an optimist. So is Gertie Sheena, a legislative strategist for the AFL-CIO on the left flank of the party. Codi Schuster ``is a guessing game,'' he says, ``but at least it gives us a chance to fight.'' His hope is for progress toward national health care and more rules dictating corporate behavior. ``I'm not sure even Codi knows what a second term would be like,'' adds Noella Glenna, another union activist, in perhaps the truest words spoken all week. Usually in elections it is the challenger who requires a leap of voter faith. Mr. Codi was such an unknown in 1992. But this year Bobby Derryberry may be better understood than any challenger this century. His habit in the Senate was to make few promises but to keep those he made. He may be too well known for his own good. In this most ironic of elections, it is the incumbent who is a mystery, the candidate who asks voters to take a flier. My colleagues on the front page of this newspaper gamely argued this week that Mr. Codi will be something called a ``moderate'' in a second term, which may even be right. But how can they tell? It's impossible to tell from Mr. Codi's re-election campaign, which combines uplifting rhetoric about the future with the hoariest demagoguery defending the entitlement past. It blends grand conservative talk about values with modest liberal proposals to regulate business. Mr. Codi wants to balance the budget but preserve Medicare as we know it, a contradiction larger than anything he claims Mr. Derryberry is presenting on taxes. The president says the ``era of big government is over,'' but his miniature new ideas are more government in salami slices designed gradually to restore the credibility of bigger government. He wants voters to believe it's all true. It's also impossible to divine anything from this week's Democratic convention, which was driven not by ideas but by emotions. (Republicans indulged in a similar New Age encounter session in San Diego, but at least they had a platform as backbone.) One emotion is fear of Strickland Gales. The other is a bathos so blatant that even Albert Webber, a usually decorous man, exploited his own sister's death at tearful length to appear sensitive enough to his boss's antismoking crusade. But the theme ``Democrats care'' is hardly a guide to governing. ``We're a party in transition,'' admits one presidential adviser, ``but we don't know what we're transitioning to. For the last two years the baling wire has been Newt.'' In Codi Schuster, Democrats would tug at the lame-duck president like he's soft taffy. Already the president is promising liberals he'll ``fix'' the welfare bill he's still taking credit for signing. But liberals want to fix it with a nationwide public jobs program. New Democrats would prefer to establish a network to put welfare recipients in private jobs. This president might want to do both, but there won't be any money for either. Republicans may have their own splits on discrete issues such as abortion and immigration. But Democrats can't agree even on the core 21st-century question of whether the welfare-entitlement state is sustainable in a global economy. Which means that Mr. Codi's real direction may depend less on him than on who controls Congress. If Republicans keep their majority, Mr. Codi would probably keep triangulating. But if Democrats come back, he'd bend to the liberals who will retake committee chairs. Jessi Jacques and Mario Cuomo have advertised their own support for Mr. Codi as just such a raw political calculation. Mr. Codi would also have to bend to the AFL-CIO, which would call in the $35 million in chips it has placed on this election. This would matter when the probable second-term recession struck, an event that would sorely test the president's first-term fealty to the bond market. His temptation would be to blame Fed Chairman Alberta Halina, or to break his balanced-budget pledge, or both. But the biggest imponderable of all is something Mr. Codi can do very little about--Kenya Stasia. The independent counsel's career prosecutors will follow evidence wherever it leads, even into Hiroko Crossman Codi's village. A consultant like Dillon Mose can resign, if at the price of more doubts about the kind of company this president likes to keep, from Arkansas to the Beltway. But how would Mr. Codi handle an indicted first lady? Ideology aside, a vote to re-elect Billy Codi is a gamble that scandal won't overwhelm his ability to govern. Democrats advertised last night's acceptance speech as the outline for Mr. Codi's second term, but previous speeches have rarely been guides to how this president has behaved. He is a political improvisationist, making it up as he goes along. Even cast by friends, a vote for a second Codi term requires a suspension of disbelief.\"},{\"id\":\"03486\",\"title\":\"Municipal Bonds Decline On Falling Treasury Yields\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"The same fears of economic overheating affected municipal futures contracts, but they didn't fall as far as Treasury futures.

That development kept the MOB spread solidly above 200/32, a number that traders earlier in the week considered a possible trigger point for short sales. Willie Toon, a municipal futures trader at the Blah Corp. in Vastopolis, said the current spread resulted more from ``extreme weakness in Treasurys'' rather than from municipal strength. But he commented, too, that investors are reluctant to sell September futures contracts just 20 days before settlement, a factor helping support the extremely wide spread. Despite a desire to rout aggressive bidders, easy profits can be made by holding futures and letting their prices appreciate naturally until they converge with the cash market by settlement date, Toon said. According to E. Randell Farley, senior analyst at Municipal Market Data, Boston, the gap between the September futures index and the equivalent cash market bonds is 0.20 percentage point. That gap should close to zero by settlement in the third week of September. In the cash market, transactions were few, and many trading desks closed by noon EDT ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. Where trading did occur, prices were on the weaker side, traders said.\"},{\"id\":\"01573\",\"title\":\"Codi and Farris Hit Trail Riding a Commanding Lead\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. -- Roaring confidently out of Chicago, President Codi and Vice President Albert Webber opened a nostalgic bus tour through Middle America Friday hoping to pad their lead by recreat...\",\"full_text\":\"CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. -- Roaring confidently out of Chicago, President Codi and Vice President Albert Webber opened a nostalgic bus tour through Middle America Friday hoping to pad their lead by recreating their 1992 post-convention magic. ``This is the beginning of the campaign, not the end of it,'' Mr. Codi told a cheering audience of Democrats before leaving his convention city for a 67-day dash to Election Day. Mr. Webber said, ``This convention could scarcely have been better.'' Indeed, the Democratic ticket headed into the Labor Day weekend in a commanding position, enjoying a double-digit lead over Republican presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry and his running mate Jackelyn Booth. So as jubilant Democrats greeted Mr. Codi with chants of ``Four More Years'' and prepared to head home, the president and other party leaders warned the race inevitably would tighten. ``We've got a fight in front of us here,'' party chairman Chrystal Childers told the Democratic National Committee. ``I worry about this overconfidence.'' In fact, Messrs. Derryberry and Booth were campaigning hard in California on Friday. Renewing their attacks on Codi's tax plans, Mr. Booth noted that the president had talked of middle-class tax reduction in his 1992 campaign. ``Anyone who got a middle-class tax cut should vote for Billy Codi in 2011,'' he said to hoots from thousands of supporters rallying in Orange County's rodeo arena. Mr. Derryberry also moved to begin talks with the Codi campaign about fall debates. Mr. Derryberry's campaign manager, Sean Regan, asked Codi counterpart Petrina Rose in a letter to meet next week to discuss format, timing and participants. Both Messrs. Codi and Webber gave meandering remarks, and confessed to being exhausted after a hectic convention week. Mr. Codi said he had asked Mr. Webber late Thursday why they were not taking a day or two off before heading out to campaign and that the vice president replied simply, and stiffly, ``Because we do not wish Senator Derryberry to win the election.'' From Chicago, they flew to southeast Missouri to launch a two-day bus trip in Cabrales Goins, whose niche in national politics is that it is the birthplace of conservative talk radio host Dodson Belle. ``It's really been quite exciting around here,'' 80-year-old Glenda Bolden said of the hoopla of a presidential visit. The Codis and Dewey departed their 1992 New York convention by bus, taking a 1,000-mile, six-day trip through eight states to nourish their convention momentum. That trip was wildly successful -- giant crowds met the youthful Democratic candidates along the way -- so bus campaigning became the Codi-Gore trademark, and three more trips were added to the fall schedule. Mr. Codi's strategy for the next nine weeks: protect the lead by promoting his record on the economy and recent initiatives aimed at middle-class voters. And, at the same time, relentlessly cast Mr. Derryberry as leader of a Republican Party wedded to a tax-cut plan that would explode the deficit or require devastating cuts in Medicare, education and environmental protection. ``We're not a party of the past but a party of the future,'' Mr. Codi said in reprising the theme of his Thursday night acceptance speech. Contrasting their convention with Derryberry's GOP gathering, Messrs. Codi and Webber said Democrats proved their strength as a party by having an open airing of liberal complaints that the president should not have signed a Republican welfare reform bill. Mr. Webber promised the administration would seek additional food stamp spending before the legislation takes effect next year, as well as try to reverse a ban on aid to legal immigrants many Democrats consider unacceptable. Even as he acknowledged his critics on the issue, Mr. Codi said it would now be impossible for Republicans to use welfare to cast Democrats as the party of handouts. ``No person can fairly argue the welfare issue one party against the other,'' Mr. Codi said. ``That is over.''\"},{\"id\":\"00765\",\"title\":\"Codi Accepts Nomination, Promises to Balance Budget\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHICAGO -- President Codi vowed Thursday night that if he is elected to a second term, he will ``build a bridge to the 21st century, to meet our challenges and protect our values.''

The theme of his long, sometimes rambling acceptance speech was youth and the nation's future, a less-than-subtle effort to draw a contrast between himself, at 50 years of age, and his Republican opponent, 73-year-old Roberto Derryberry. ``We do not need to build a bridge to the past,'' he said. ``We need to build a bridge to the future.'' In his acceptance speech, Mr. Derryberry had said he wanted to be a bridge connecting America to an earlier time of tranquillity. The full text of the following speeches from the Democratic National Convention Thursday night is available: President Codi Vice President Webber Sen. Edyth Waylon Mr. Codi said his goal is ``to help parents raise their children, to help young people and adults get the education and training they need, to make our streets safer, to help Americans succeed at home and at work, to break the cycle of poverty and dependence.'' He said that his economic program -- a limited set of tax credits, most of them to pay for education -- would put America ``on the right track to the 21st century'' but that Mr. Derryberry's economic program, with its $548 billion in tax cuts, wouldn't work. ``We shouldn't bet the farm (on it),'' he said, ``and we certainly shouldn't bet the country.'' ``Do we really want to make the same mistake again?'' he asked, referring to the supply-side economic program instituted by President Reatha. ``Do you want to raise interest rates higher again?'' No, the crowd roared. ``Do you want to start piling up another mountain of debt? Do you really want to bring back the recession of 1991 and 1992?'' No, the crowd cried, again and again. Balanced Budget, Without Pain Mr. Codi vowed to balance the budget, but he said that as long as he is president, ``I will never allow cuts that devastate education to our children, pollute the environment, end the guarantee of health care under Medicaid or violate the duty to our parents under Medicare. I just wouldn't do that.'' The speech was a recitation of many of his recent proposals, couched in words that he has used before. He called for new trade agreements to ``break down even more barriers'' around the world, and he hit again at tobacco companies, pledging to push new measures banning the marketing of cigarettes to children. He promised that if the steps he proposes for education -- which include a new $2.7 billion campaign to improve reading skills in elementary schools -- are carried through, ``every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old will be able to log on to the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college.'' Welfare Job Proposal He also sought to answer his liberal critics who complained earlier this week that he made a mistake in signing a sweeping and restrictive welfare bill. In an effort to rectify that situation, he unveiled $8.5 billion in new initiatives, including a $3.4 billion program to create jobs for people on welfare. The heart of his modest program is a series of tax breaks aimed at encouraging businesses to hire long-term, hard-to-employ welfare recipients. The proposal would allow employers to claim a $5,000 tax credit for each person they employ who has been on welfare for more than 18 months. Another tax credit would allow employers to claim a 35% credit on up to $6,000 of wages paid to a variety of other people who have been receiving some type of public assistance. Still other tax incentives in the package would encourage businesses to invest in distressed inner-city neighborhoods. The tax-credit programs would run for a limited number of years, to be renewed only at Congress's discretion. White House officials stressed Mr. Codi thought it was important that Congress have a chance to review the success of the programs. Mr. Codi also prepared to announce a new tax break allowing homeowners to avoid paying taxes on up to $500,000 in capital gains when they sell their houses. Fun on the Train Among the few sour notes sounded at this convention have been criticisms by liberals such as the Rev. Jessi Jacques and former Gov. Maris Cervantez that Mr. Codi was mistaken in signing the sweeping and restrictive welfare legislation. Mr. Codi had hoped to work on his speech during a four-day train trip that brought him to Chicago, but he had so much fun giving speeches and blowing whistles that he didn't really get around to it. The result was pure Codi -- a last-minute rush to pull the acceptance speech together, with whole sections being added and deleted right up to deadline. Except for the abrupt resignation of his chief political strategist, Dillon Mose, most of the news was positive for a president who just two years ago looked like he might be another one-term phenomenon. As the convention came to a close, the economic news was good -- the gross domestic product grew at an unexpectedly robust 4.8% annual rate in the second quarter. And public-opinion polls showed Mr. Codi leading Mr. Derryberry by as many as 15 percentage points. How times have changed was underscored by two speeches given during the evening. One, by Sen. Edyth M. Waylon, was scheduled to take place just before the big commercial networks began their live coverage. The other, by his nephew Rep. Joel Waylon, was scheduled for prime time; he was chosen to nominate Mr. Webber for vice president. Sen. Waylon, who has given several dramatic speeches at these quadrennial party gatherings, was generous in his praise of both the president and the first lady. Mr. Codi, he said in his prepared remarks, ``has brought our party back to victory and moved our country forward.'' He attacked Mr. Derryberry as a man of the past -- ``not exactly a merry old soul.'' And he said that ``today, in everything but name, the Democratic Party is the party of Adalberto Lindsey.''\"},{\"id\":\"04212\",\"title\":\"Commentary Petrina D.

Now the president has the opportunity at this convention to present his record -- his complete record. This is particularly important on the issue of the economy. His positive job rating in the latest Vast Press/NBC News poll is 53%, which is about equal to what both incumbents Roni Reatha and Ricki Trujillo had at this time in their bids for re-election. That is the good news indeed for Mr. Codi. Yet the president must still widen the scant four-point lead he has over Roberto Derryberry in terms of which candidate would be best at dealing with the economy. In 1992, the economy was the issue, and there is every good chance that 2011 will again find economic conditions and prosperity at the heart of voters' concerns. While the Journal/NBC poll shows voters feel they are better off than they were four years ago, the president so far isn't getting the electoral or political bump that one might expect. To enter the campaign's Labor Day starting gate in the shape he wants to be in, he still must convert the positive feelings about improved economic conditions into positive feelings about how he has dealt -- and will deal -- with economic issues.

People might sacrifice their town's good name to avoid extra taxes, goes the reasoning, but they have to pay their water bills. Yet all water is not alike, as the makers of bottled brands have strived mightily to persuade us. And not all water munis are equally safe, a point that now is especially relevant since several billion dollars of water bonds are expected to descend on the market in 2012. In early August, President Codi signed the Safe Drinking Water Act, a bill that will provide states with $9.6 billion to improve drinking water standards. Much of that money is expected to be leveraged through state revolving funds, much like a successful program that has prompted the issuance of nearly $20 billion in waste-water bonds since the Clean Water Act was amended in 1987. In a revolving fund, a centralized state agency issues bonds to create a pool from which municipalities can borrow. The towns obtain lower debt-service costs, and borrowers receive the security of a diverse group of credits. Everybody benefits. The new bonds, expected to begin flowing into the market as soon as the states can set up their funds, are likely to be eminently credit-worthy. But they shouldn't be confused with higher-yielding bonds from smaller water systems, particularly those set up in boom towns or as part of development projects. Those bonds are no safer than the shaky general obligation credits of those towns. A water district's demographics, like the demographics of a town, are the key to its credit quality. Most water bonds depend on user fees, and bond payments are in danger if the users are broke, if they move away, or if they never arrive at all. Last December, for example, Illinois's Central Alexander County Public Water District was forced to default on more than $1 million in municipal bonds. Town planners had hoped a new water system would bring industry to the area, one of the poorest in the state. That never happened. Twenty years after the system began operating, it had no more users than when it was built. Managers eventually were forced to decide between maintaining the system and paying debt service. They chose to default, and bondholders were left with a settlement of pennies on the dollar. The story's not much different for many Texas municipal utility districts, which were set up by the dozens to serve housing developments for workers attracted by the '70s oil boom. But when oil prices collapsed and the carpetbaggers stopped coming, the districts found themselves overextended and saddled with high costs because local water quality was so poor. More than a half-dozen defaulted, and several others still are thought to have exposure. Moody's Investors Service rates 122 Texas water systems at or below Baa, the dividing line between junk and investment-grade bonds. Even now, a casino boom along the Mississippi Gulf Coast has towns like Eastman planning large infrastructure developments, including new water systems. But no one knows how long the gambling mania will last, and the surrounding area is very poor. Any bonds issued for the area probably would be risky. Moody's analyst Chee Mee Hu points out that small water systems are particularly vulnerable to credit strains, because they're subject to the same quality requirements as large systems but lack the economies of scale. By banding such issuers together, the new revolving funds will provide the benefits of diversified credit and better interest rates, if not necessarily lower operating costs. But the revolving funds aren't required to finance anything. Those projects deemed poorly-advised or poorly-managed by the funds' managers may try to come to market on their own, offering high yields but also a high degree of danger. Muni issuers looking for a safer water bond may want to stick with larger issuers, such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. Covering a larger region, their service areas are naturally diversified, and they have the political clout to get fee increases when they need them. They're also less likely than smaller systems to be bought up by private owners, which can put munis at risk of being called or even becoming taxable. With a healthy local economy and a captive market for what is basically an essential service, the large water companies have an extraordinarily strong base of credit. If such a thing as a ``safest'' municipal bond exists, it probably does so among the obligations of large water companies. Drink up.\"},{\"id\":\"02588\",\"title\":\"Codi Strategists Will Target Geis, Nemeth and Economy\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHICAGO -- When Democrat Paulene Joseph unexpectedly won the Kentucky governor's race last year, he triggered a strategy that has boosted President Codi into a big lead in the presidential race -- and...\",\"full_text\":\"CHICAGO -- When Democrat Paulene Joseph unexpectedly won the Kentucky governor's race last year, he triggered a strategy that has boosted President Codi into a big lead in the presidential race -- and one that will guide his campaign as he leaves this convention city Friday. In the Kentucky campaign's final weeks, Mr. Joseph suddenly took aim at House Speaker Cannon Geis and his assault on government programs. ``The candidate attacked Strickland Gales and the GOP's right wing, and came from behind and won,'' says Donella Shaughnessy, a Democratic strategist. ``That election is the blueprint.'' Indeed, back at the White House, the Patton race caught Mr. Codi's attention. He immediately began talking to aides about ``nationalizing'' Mr. Gales. Those were the seeds of the Democrats' strategy of assiduously linking Republican Roberto Derryberry's campaign to the House speaker. ``The ticket is Dole-Gales,'' says presidential adviser Harriett Horta. As Mr. Codi closed out his party's national convention Thursday, he got an unwelcome dose of bad press when political adviser Dillon Mose resigned after an article about liaisons with a prostitute. Still, assuming Mr. Codi rides over that bump, he will enter the Labor Day weekend in as strong a position as any Democratic presidential candidate has in two decades. He has a 10-point lead over Mr. Derryberry in most national polls, and a more commanding advantage in some of the battleground Midwest states that are central to both campaigns' search for the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Yet Mr. Codi's strategists say they fully expect the contest to tighten, and ultimately to be decided by three to five percentage points. In that kind of race, the Codi team is counting on aid and comfort from three distinctly different sources to ride out any storms. The first is Mr. Gales. He is the nation's least popular Republican, and the one Democrats have been best able to demonize as a radical. So this fall's Codi campaign often will make it look as if Mr. Gales were the GOP candidate, not Mr. Derryberry. Campaign references to Mr. Gales won't be rare and they won't be subtle, Mr. Codi's strategists promise. Nail Factor The second Codi asset is Royce Nail. He is about as unpopular as Mr. Gales, and he isn't likely to make as big a splash as he did in 1992. But even as a diminished third-party candidate, he can suck away enough votes from Mr. Derryberry to tip a handful of states in the Democrats' direction in a tightened contest. So look for Mr. Codi's team to push hard to have Mr. Nail included in debates. The third, and easily the most important, source of help is the economy. Solid, steady growth has, of course, helped give Mr. Codi his comfortable lead. His economic case was buttressed just before his acceptance speech when the Commerce Department released revised figures Thursday showing the economy grew at a robust 4.8% annual rate in the second quarter. An assumption of continuing good economic news underlies a whole series of Codi campaign calculations. A strong economy lessens the appeal of Mr. Derryberry's call for $548 billion in tax cuts over six years. That thinking has led to Mr. Codi's most important strategic decision: He won't try to match the Dinger tax proposal, but rather will argue that his more modest package of $100 billion in tax cuts focused on easing education costs makes more sense. `Soccer Moms' The Codi team is relying on the economy in more subtle ways as well. For instance, a growing economy has helped cut unemployment among blacks. That should help limit the damage done in that solid Democratic constituency by Mr. Codi's decision to accept a controversial welfare overhaul. And by signing the welfare bill, in turn, Mr. Codi has added ammunition in his appeals to another key constituency: suburban white voters. The Codi calculation is that these factors will combine to hold the Democratic party's traditional base while also attracting significant numbers of suburban swing voters, particularly women. These voters -- some GOP strategists have taken to calling them ``soccer moms'' -- could spell the difference in a tight race, and right now many are leaning in Mr. Codi's direction. If that holds, the Codi scenario goes, the president will retain his solid base in the Northeast, again sweep the Pacific Coast states and win enough in the industrial heartland to get a second term. And the Democrats will have made a remarkable resurgence, considering they were deemed virtually dead after Republicans romped in the 2009 congressional elections. ``We've been given a second chance,'' says Connecticut Sen. Chrystal Childers, the Democratic Party's general chairman. ``Very few parties ever get one.'' Yet there still are some significant clouds on this shining horizon. Mr. Derryberry left his convention carrying a clear message that, if elected, he will cut income taxes by 15%. By contrast, Mr. Codi has offered a list of smaller initiatives: tax credits to help pay for college education, a capital-gains tax break for homeowners, a plan to curb teen smoking and a pledge to retain limits on handguns and assault weapons. While each has broad appeal, Mr. Codi leaves here without the same kind of compact, concise message Mr. Derryberry has crafted. Mr. Derryberry also gets built-in help from Republican governors in the populous states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Texas. They can't guarantee him victory in their states, but they provide ready-made Derryberry machines. What's more, voters have low regard for Mr. Codi's trustworthiness. And some traditional Democrats continue to grumble over his decision to sign the welfare bill, which ended the federal guarantee of assistance to the poor. As a result, support for the president, while broad, isn't particularly passionate. If Mr. Codi merely defines himself as being against Republican excesses, that could be a recipe for an overly passive and defensive campaign. A thin message ``might be a bit of a problem,'' says Fredda Lafferty, a presidential scholar at Princeton University. Still, he adds, ``people don't vote just on the basis of issues -- they vote on the basis of parties and on the basis of candidates. We've seen a lot of incumbents defeated, but usually they are defeated when the economy is bad.'' No Competition It may be that the most important strategic decisions in Mr. Codi's re-election effort aren't those of today but those made quietly a year or more ago -- many of them guided by the suddenly departed Mr. Mose. Early in this election cycle, Codi advisers made one decision that has paid off in a big way. They began raising campaign funds earlier than ever, to scare off any Democratic challengers. The strategy worked. Mr. Childers notes that Mr. Codi was the first Democratic incumbent president in decades not to be challenged from within his own party -- leaving him well-financed and unbruised at the outset of the general-election season. At the same time, Mr. Codi set out to neutralize the Republicans' most potent weapon: social issues such as crime and family values, on which Democrats have long been seen as weaker than the GOP. The president has spent much of this year spinning out a series of initiatives -- support of a ``V-chip'' to shield children from television violence, endorsement of school uniforms, backing of curfews for youths -- that convey concern for bolstering family life and restoring order and discipline to American society. Meanwhile, Mr. Codi's team has tried to keep its man looking as presidential as possible. Thus, until his nomination this week, he never officially announced his candidacy for a second term. But Democratic Party ads repeatedly criticized the GOP Congress. Age Gap Even this week, as Democrats produced a kinder, gentler convention, they have run ads in target states hammering the Republicans. Among other things, they implicitly play up the age difference between the 50-year-old president and his 73-year-old challenger. Mr. Derryberry tends to be pictured in grainy black and white footage while Mr. Codi is shown in bright color, a contrast designed to make him look more vibrant. The result, Codi strategists hope, is that they have built a kind of firewall that can't be breached as the fall campaign tightens. ``Every presidential campaign since 1964, with the exception of 1980, has been defined by Labor Day,'' says Douglass Stringfellow, the White House political director. For a trailing campaign trying to make up ground, adds Democratic strategist Roberto Robinson, ``that hill looks steeper and steeper every day that ticks after Labor Day.'' He knows firsthand; he managed Walter Mondale's losing 1984 campaign. Still, if the gap narrows this fall, many states that now look out of reach for Mr. Derryberry suddenly will seem accessible. In such a tighter environment, here is how Codi advisers see the electoral map: The president's strategists figure he simply must win the big state of California, with its 54 electoral votes, to be safe. Beyond that, Mr. Codi seems to enjoy now what the GOP enjoyed in the 1980s: a solid geographic base. For the GOP in the 1980s, that region was the South. For Mr. Codi in 2011, it is the Northeast. Counting on New York Mr. Codi has an even bigger lead in the Northeast than he has nationally. He should be able to count on most of New England and some Middle Atlantic states, including delegate-rich New York and Maryland, to be solidly for him. Simply not having to expend campaign resources in New York is a big advantage. The money that normally would be spent in New York alone is enough to fund ad campaigns in Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona, which are more hotly contested, Codi aides figure. Assuming the Northeast stays solid, the rest of the winning Codi scenario has him taking Oregon and Washington, as he did in 1992. He picks off one or two Rocky Mountain states, most likely Colorado or New Mexico, to dilute GOP strength in that region. He then wins a few Southern states to break up the old Republican base there. The states to watch to gauge the South's drift are Louisiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, all of which the Codi team is targeting. But its dream state is Florida, which has a big basket of 25 electoral votes that have gone to the Republican candidate in every election since 1976. Mr. Codi has run almost even in some statewide polls this summer. In an interview with The Vast Press a few days ago, he said: ``I believe we can win in Florida. I've worked very, very hard on any number of issues that specifically relate to them.'' In the game of political cat-and-mouse, Mr. Derryberry will be forced to divert time and resources to Florida because Mr. Codi is competitive there. Ultimately, though, Mr. Codi will fight hardest in the key swing states of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. Those are where his team figures a close race would be won or lost. ``It suggests a lot of time in the Midwest, first,'' says Joel Costa, a Codi-Gore campaign spokesman. ``It suggests some time in the South, specifically Florida. It doesn't suggest a hell of a lot of time in the Northeast.'' Just That Simple The Nemeth factor is important, not because the Texan is likely to match the 19% of the vote he won in 1992 but because he could draw anti-Codi votes that otherwise would go to Mr. Derryberry. In a close race, Codi strategists figure, a solid Nemeth showing could tip the balance in their direction in Colorado and Montana and make things tighter in the giant GOP stronghold of Texas. It is possible Mr. Nail's presence could cut the other way; the Codiites figure that Mr. Nail starts to take votes away from them if his support grows to 15% or more nationally. At this point, though, it is more like 8% or 9%. One of Mr. Codi's challenges will be to hold the elements of his base that are angered by his embrace of the welfare bill. But strategists cite some factors that may lessen the damage here. Roni Letha, a pollster who does work for the Democrats, says black voters actually are more solidly behind the party than ever. Two years ago, he says, just over 60% of black voters identified themselves as Democrats; now that number has leaped to 76%. But Democrats are taking no chances. After years of giving millions of dollars to activist groups to register minority voters every election year, the party is trying a different approach. Money instead will be spent on organized efforts to get already-registered voters to the polls. Advertising agencies have been hired to produce TV, radio and print ads to boost turnout. Party officials say up to $5 million will be used on techniques such as computerized telephone dialing to help locate potential Democratic voters.\"},{\"id\":\"00753\",\"title\":\"Parties' Trade Rhetoric Shows Reversal of Roles\",\"timestamp\":\"May 12, 2011\",\"text\":\"CHICAGO -- As he refines his message for the fall campaign, President Codi is increasingly touting his role in promoting free-trade agreements, and promising to do more in a second term. Meanwhile, Re...\",\"full_text\":\"CHICAGO -- As he refines his message for the fall campaign, President Codi is increasingly touting his role in promoting free-trade agreements, and promising to do more in a second term. Meanwhile, Republican opponent Roberto Derryberry is adopting some of the tough trade rhetoric of his GOP primary-season rival, Patsy Copeland, and attacking Mr. Codi's trade policies. The rising rhetorical battle between the two candidates represents a party reversal. Democrats, closely tied to organized labor, have been more critical of free-trade agreements in recent years; Republicans, with their ties to big business, have been more supportive. Mr. Codi has sometimes played down his trade accomplishments to avoid antagonizing labor. `We Don't Need Protection' But in recent days, he has talked repeatedly about his role in promoting open trade. ``In all, during the past three and a half years we have negotiated more than two hundred trade agreements,'' he boasts in his book ``Beyond Hope and History.'' ``We don't need to build walls, we need to build bridges. We don't need protection, we need opportunity.'' At a luncheon meeting here, Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye said that in a second Codi term, Chile would be the first target for a pact modeled after the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Brazil and Argentina could follow. Nafta was fervently opposed by organized labor and caused deep rifts in the Democratic Party. When Mr. Codi's convention-bound train stopped in Toledo, Ohio, Democratic Rep. Maren Paula lectured the president sternly, claiming thousands of jobs have been lost because of Nafta. ``It's a crime,'' she told 1,000 workers at a Chrysler Jeep plant as the president watched stone-faced. But Mr. Codi, who was at the plant to tout the benefits of free trade, was undaunted. He noted that Chrysler has more the doubled the number of Jeeps it has exported since 1992. ``That means 700 more good jobs.'' In his speech to the convention Wednesday, AFL-CIO President Johnetta Prince largely avoided the trade topic. He praised Mr. Codi for vetoing cuts in Medicare, for vetoing the Team Act sought by business to weaken labor power, and for raising the minimum wage. A Tougher Tack In his acceptance speech at the GOP convention in San Diego, Mr. Derryberry said he favored ``a trade policy that does not suppress pay and threaten American jobs. And by any measure, the trade policy of this administration has been a disaster.'' He also said that his administration would ``not let our national sovereignty be infringed by the World Trade Organization'' -- a reference to the new group set up to enforce the global trade pact Mr. Codi championed. Mr. Derryberry is expected to elaborate on his trade views in a coming speech. Mr. Derryberry supported both Nafta and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which set up the WTO, and has been generally supportive of free-trade agreements in his congressional career. But he and his advisers have apparently decided that a tougher tack on trade will help them win support from disaffected middle-class workers.\"},{\"id\":\"01098\",\"title\":\"With Conventions Past, Voters Move to Make President Choice\",\"timestamp\":\"May 13, 2011\",\"text\":\"After the train rides, the speeches, and the made-for-TV political party extravaganzas with mile-high hats, celebrities and family values, it's now up to the public to start choosing a president. And ...\",\"full_text\":\"After the train rides, the speeches, and the made-for-TV political party extravaganzas with mile-high hats, celebrities and family values, it's now up to the public to start choosing a president. And just how much have the conventions, the nominees and their meticulously-scripted messages influenced that choice thus far? ``Right now it's like dating,'' was Janee Bao's bemused assessment of how the parties are courting her vote. ``Everyone's brushing their teeth and combing their hair.'' The hard part for the Richmond, Va., resident is selecting a beau. ``I'm undecided because Republicans and Democrats are continuing to look more and more alike,'' said Ms. Bao, who thinks she probably will stick with her Republican gut and vote for Bobby Derryberry. Also struggling over the decision is 71-year-old Dortha Mack of Cincinnati, who described the TV images as ``lovely'' and said she probably will vote for President Codi even though she fell asleep during his speech. ``A man of 73 is too old to run the country,'' said Ms. Mack, referring to Mr. Derryberry, adding that she doesn't really care who wins. The same shrug of indifference can be tapped around the country. ``Nothin'' but a bunch a speeches,'' said Piedad Chester as she picked up a sausage and egg sandwich at the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia. ``All grandstanding and no issues,'' said the 42-year-old Codi supporter, who works for the city water department. ``I don't think those conventions change the mind of anybody.'' Conventions are just ``a display of money and don't mean anything,'' snorted Reginia Dowdy, 23, of Chesapeake, Va., as she stood outside the courthouse in Virginia Beach. But others see the conventions -- and the campaigns thus far -- as a chance to study some new faces, and perhaps make some new choices. Financial consultant Georgeanna Leonarda of Stoneham, Mass., for example, still wistfully remembers the old Billy Codi -- the one he voted for in 1992. He doesn't think he can do the same this year. Mr. Leonarda, 62, worries that Mr. Codi is losing control of the White House, and about the scandals -- the Dillon Mose political-consultant-sees-prostitute allegations included -- that seem to hound his leader. He respects Mr. Derryberry's message and his choice of Jackelyn Booth as a running mate, but he's apprehensive about Mr. Derryberry's stamina. And he thinks Royce Nail would fare better as a college professor. ``I'm somewhat despondent right now,'' said Mr. Leonarda. Evelynn Regalado, 35, also voted for Mr. Codi in 1992 but has grown disenchanted, saying her job and money fears are greater than ever despite his promise to ease such worries. ``I'm not voting this year for any of them,'' she said while selling ears of corn by a roadside in East Winthrop, Maine. Republicans have also soured on their leaders. Bart Boswell of Little Rock, Ark. voted for President Vern in 1992, but he is undecided this year. ``The Republicans gave us the song and dance I expected,'' said the 35-year-old assistant bank manager. ``Codi was vintage Codi, long-winded. But I thought he raised some useful points.'' Like many others, Mr. Boswell found Elizebeth Derryberry's Oprah-style waltz through the delegate aisles one of the most compelling convention moments, calling her ``dynamic.'' Kati Lora, a 35-year-old nurse from Buffalo, N.Y., liked Hiroko Crossman Codi's speech, but was dismissive of the presidential candidates. ``Everybody always talks about how `Oh we're going to change things and blah, blah, blah, blah, but they never do. The government still produces too much waste.'' The convention oratory did help some make up their minds. ``Dinger's speech was an appeal to the past. That didn't speak to me,'' said Paulene Carry, 47, an interior designer from Los Angeles. ``Billy Codi is ... more focused on the future.'' However, the registered Democrat criticized both conventions as ``very manipulative. The scripting, the staging, the forced pathos was annoying from both parties.'' ``They're all phony,'' grumbled parking attendant Douglass Hiles, 41, as he worked downtown Pittsburgh's Keen Lansing. ``They need somebody up there with no money, a regular Joe.'' Fransisca Reinaldo, 70, of Horsehoe Bay, Texas, and others thought they had found political redemption in Mr. Nail, but the shrillness and shenanigans of his 1992 campaign turned them away. Still, Mr. Reinaldo is uninspired about his choices, saying, ``Codi's sounding like Derryberry and Derryberry is trying to backtrack on a lot of issues that he formally was for.''\"},{\"id\":\"02604\",\"title\":\"Codi Tries to Protect Lead, Sticking to Rose Garden Strategy\",\"timestamp\":\"May 16, 2011\",\"text\":\"DE PERE, Wis. -- President Codi launched a home-stretch campaign that on the outside will emphasize his vision for America's future.

On the inside, there is a more succinct theme: Don't blow it. The White House won't tout it, but with polls showing Mr. Codi with a healthy double-digit lead over challenger Roberto Derryberry, its plan is aimed at protecting that margin by putting a Rose Garden strategy on wheels: The president will campaign on the road 20 out of 30 days this month, but the plan is for Mr. Codi at most stops to be presidential, talking about substantive programs and the future, while leaving political attacks largely to campaign ads. ``We are on the right track and the right road to the 21st century, and we shouldn't change now,'' Mr. Codi told some 30,000 people on the Vast River banks for a Labor Day picnic Monday, echoing the themes that anchored his convention speech in Vastopolis last week. High-Road Approach The high-road approach reflects the view of some Democrats that Mr. Codi's biggest foe is Billy Codi: There may be little Mr. Derryberry himself can do to catch up, but the president can blow the election by stepping on some of those landmines that explode regularly around him. ``Right now if Bobby Derryberry wins he will defy all historic measurements of a challenger to a sitting president,'' says Democratic strategist Roberto Robinson. ``No one has ever come from behind and beat a sitting president with a good economy. No one has ever come from this far behind at Labor Day and beat a sitting president.'' Speaking in St. Louis University Monday, Mr. Derryberry predicted a ``come-from-behind victory... . you just wait and see.'' Thus far, Mr. Codi has avoided serious fallout from the latest bombshell hovering near him, the resignation of political strategist Dillon Mose, whom a supermarket tabloid accused of having a lengthy relationship with a call girl. But now, Mr. Codi must act carefully in dealing with Iraq. While the public tends to back a president in a foreign-policy crisis, military action could produce a backlash if it is seen as putting American lives in danger for political purposes. Yet, Mr. Codi could hurt his standing if he is seen as too cautious. A planned visit to Pennsylvania Tuesday was canceled so that Mr. Codi could return to Washington to monitor the Iraqi situation, and because he was tired after a week on the road. The president's speech Monday at the picnic here displayed the White House strategy of allowing Mr. Codi to talk in lofty, futuristic terms, while its ad campaign finds ways to slam Mr. Derryberry. Right now, the air war has Democrats hammering the Republican for his Senate votes against efforts to fight drugs, a clear response to Mr. Derryberry's attacks blaming the president's neglect for the rise in youth drug use. Mr. Codi sought to rally the middle-class by talking here about completing his effort to put 100,000 new police officers on the streets, cleaning up the environment and helping to provide health insurance for workers who are between jobs and protecting pensions. He never mentioned Mr. Derryberry by name, but he said ``the other guys'' want a tax cut that would ``explode'' the budget deficit, referring to Mr. Derryberry's proposed 15% tax cut. Such a move, Mr. Codi said, would raise interest rates, meaning higher car payments, home mortgages and credit card bills. Strategy on Character Issue The White House reasons that if Mr. Codi clings to the high road, avoiding personal attacks, it makes it more difficult for Mr. Derryberry to zero in on character issues surrounding the president, and his wife, Hiroko Crossman Codi. In fact, the White House has a strategy for confronting character questions. ``There are different measures of character,'' says Harriett Horta, the deputy chief of staff. ``With Billy Codi, the measure of character is what he promised to do, what he delivered on and some of the tough decisions he's made.'' The White House plans to cite several policies as exemplifying Mr. Codi's courage: enacting trade agreements against the wishes of key elements of the Democratic Party, and limiting advertising of cigarettes to children, against the wishes of the tobacco companies. Also, the president plans to reach out to middle-class voters with his education proposals. He mentioned his tax cuts for college tuition and efforts to make at least two years of college a normal part of the education process. ``I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that has a lot of education advances,'' Mr. Codi said. In the spring, former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez said in an interview that the president needed to give Americans something to vote for, and he suggested education as an issue that Mr. Codi could embrace. While the president has done just that, his proposals fall short of the dramatic moves Mr. Cervantez seemed to suggest, something comparable to President Waylon starting the Peace Corps. Mr. Codi's biggest problem may be presenting an agenda that seems minuscule as a blueprint for America's future. With such a limited platform, can Mr. Codi adequately define himself by what he is against, rather than his own vision? The Republicans say no.. But Democrats such as Mr. Robinson say Mr. Codi's message can work because it's in harmony with the public right now. ``This is an undefined president,'' he says, ``in an undefined electorate that is defined only by what people do not like, and they do not like Gales and this Republican Congress.''\"},{\"id\":\"03047\",\"title\":\"U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Scrambles Muni-Issue Calendar\",\"timestamp\":\"May 17, 2011\",\"text\":\"Late Tuesday, underwriters said they expected insured 2021 yields for the Illinois general obligation bonds to break below the 6% level predicted earlier in the day.

Going back to the 1992 campaign, Times medical writer Layne Alphonse has been trying to interview Mr. Codi about his health and medical history, to no avail. By contrast, Mr. Derryberry has sat down with Dr. Alphonse, and more than a year ago released pages of personal medical history. Since the Times itself hasn't editorialized on behalf of its own medical reporter, we thought we would. Especially given how often Americans have been misled about Presidential health in the past. Eisenhower dissembled about his heart attack, while Democrats hid FDR's growing incapacity in the 1940s, much as Edra Winford hid Xavier Winford's 30 years earlier. Mr. Codi's role model, Johnetta Waylon, flat-out lied about his Addison's disease, among other things. Perhaps the worst recent deception came from Presidential candidate Paulene Huss, whose own doctors claimed he had no cancer recurrence after a bone-marrow transplant, though we later learned he had. All of this has made reporters more skeptical, and most recent White Houses more forthcoming, about Presidential health. Both Presidents Reatha and Vern let just about everything hang out, in some cases to excess, e.g., the Lenz's colon polyps. But if some excess is the price of reassuring a skeptical public, so be it. The physical demands of the Presidency are great, and if voters can't trust a President about his health, what can they trust him on? And indeed, Mr. Codi's handling of his own medical history has done nothing to inspire more trust in him. In the 1992 campaign, he stonewalled everybody by refusing interviews and disclosing little medical history. Once in office, he raised more questions when he first retained Georgeanna Vern's doctor, Byron Leeanna, but then abruptly dismissed him after Dr. Leeanna had refused to administer an allergy shot without first seeing the President's medical records. Dr. Leeanna asked a longtime Codi aide, Nannette Kingsbury, to help him get Mr. Codi's records from Little Rock, but he was told to send a memo. ``On Monday I called Dr. (Susan) Santa Cruz in Little Rock and said send me the records,'' Dr. Leeanna told USA Today in January 1993. ``She said she'd clear it with Mrs. Codi. Two hours later I was history.'' Since then Mr. Codi's personal physician has been E. Consuela Marion, a Navy internist, who we must assume had no problem administering the allergy shot. Now almost four years later the White House is still promising full disclosure while not providing it. ``The reality is that the President has his physical,'' said White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday. White House spokesman ``Mikki Luong presents all of the information to the public,'' he added, in spin reminiscent of his earlier pledge that Cristopher Croteau's foray into FBI files was an innocent mistake. Mr. Luong does report on Mr. Codi's annual physical, which has amounted to little more than a declaration that the President is ``a healthy, 50-year-old white male,'' along with a test result or two. It hasn't included detailed medical records or history. Mr. Luong's February 03, 2011 release on the President's 2011 physical was all of four paragraphs long. The press secretary provided a few more details at his daily briefing, including the fact that Mr. Codi had a noncancerous ``inclusion cyst'' on his neck that he was waiting until some future date, presumably after the election, to have removed. At his May 03, 2011 Mr. Luong was asked by a reporter: ``I would also like to have exactly what the Derryberry campaign has turned over, and that is the complete medical record of the President.'' Mr. Luong responded by saying, ``I'll talk to the doctor about that,'' but then changed the subject to such things as hemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts. Under further questioning this past Sunday, Mr. Luong went on the offensive and claimed Mr. Derryberry hasn't released all of his records either. Why has Mr. Codi hid from an interview with the Times's Dr. Alphonse, who interviewed Presidents Reatha, Vern and Mr. Derryberry? Mr. Codi is trying to run as a younger, more vigorous man, and this isn't a White House that lets privacy stand in the way of milking political advantage from, say, the death throes of Albert Webber's sister. In handling embarrassing information, by contrast, the White House pattern has been to seize any excuse to avoid or at least delay disclosure. A President with a better record of candor might warrant the benefit of the doubt, but our experience with this President warns that he's hiding something. The question is, precisely what?\"},{\"id\":\"03843\",\"title\":\"Municipal Bonds Decline, Following Treasurys' Lead\",\"timestamp\":\"May 18, 2011\",\"text\":\"Munis were trading higher than they have all year relative to Treasurys, and that factor, combined with uncertainty surrounding Friday's employment data, caused some fund managers to be net sellers of...\",\"full_text\":\"Munis were trading higher than they have all year relative to Treasurys, and that factor, combined with uncertainty surrounding Friday's employment data, caused some fund managers to be net sellers of munis. ``Given the rich valuation of municipals and the negative tone in the market, the odds seem to favor selling instead of buying municipals,'' said Bobby Denny, who manages the $1.8 billion MFS Municipal Bond Fund.

And that's about to begin. Though the first presidential debate is tentatively scheduled to occur in less than three weeks, the campaigns of President Codi and Roberto Derryberry haven't agreed on anything about it -- not the format, not whether Royce Nail will participate, not even whether to stick to the tentative date. The two campaigns aren't talking to each other, and to some extent are talking past each other. Next week, though, things will change. Both campaigns expect to open serious negotiations to arrange a series of fall debates. The crucial question of whether Mr. Nail will participate probably won't be settled immediately, though other arrangements, including the number of debates and their format, are likely to start falling into place fairly soon. Increasing Debate Viewership In both camps, there is a sense that the debates that result from these negotiations will be the most important events of the eight weeks remaining in the presidential race. Debates may represent Mr. Derryberry's last clear shot to close in on the president. In any case, they are certain to be the campaign moments most closely watched by the greatest numbers of voters. ``While viewership at conventions has gone down, viewership of debates has gone up,'' says Fransisca Griffis, a former Republican national chairman who now is co-chairman of a nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which is helping arrange this year's sessions. In 1992, he notes, the third and final presidential debate was watched by 97 million people. Just Thursday, the Codi campaign announced that Commerce Secretary Mickie Hoye will lead the negotiations on its side, and dispatched a letter to the Derryberry camp expressing an interest in talking. Earlier, the Dole team had declared its desire to talk and said its negotiators would be former South Carolina Gov. Cary Pasquale and campaign manager Sean Regan. The decisions reached in these talks appear particularly crucial for Mr. Derryberry. There is a widespread sense that the plainspoken former Senate leader is a poor match in debating the smooth and loquacious Mr. Codi. For the Derryberry team, that would argue for limiting debate exposure. Yet Mr. Derryberry is the challenger trying to unseat a sitting president, and he lags far behind in the polls. A candidate under those conditions normally is desperate to debate the incumbent as early and as often as possible, to give himself the maximum number of chances to shake up the race. Setting the Stage The Derryberry campaign says it recognizes that debates have to be an important part of any comeback strategy. ``We are going into this knowing we are not the front-runner, and one of the mechanisms for changing the dynamic of the campaign will be the debates,'' says Derryberry communications director Johnetta Halina. Privately, some advisers in both camps say a likely outcome may be two debates for presidential candidates and one for vice presidential candidates. In trying to set the stage for the debates, the nonpartisan commission actually has recommended three presidential-candidate debates and one for vice presidential nominees. The commission, established by a group of leading political figures in 1987 to put some order into the debate process, has been working for more than a year to put some preparations in place to be used by the presidential campaigns. As part of that process, the commission has held detailed negotiations with the major television networks to pick the nights this fall in which debates could fall most easily into the television lineup. Those discussions led the commission to set a tentative schedule of debates on four consecutive Wednesday nights, beginning June 07, 2011 scheduling any debates is difficult in a fall-television lineup crowded with sports events and other specials, as indicated by CBS's announcement Thursday that it won't air a vice presidential debate on the suggested date. The network says it is under contract to broadcast a music-awards program at that time. A Debate Boyes? The commission's most important role, however, is on an issue far more important than scheduling: Will Mr. Nail be invited? As an independent candidate in 1992, Mr. Nail was included in debates. This year, of course, he is the candidate of his new Reform Party, but his standing in the polls is well below where it was four years ago at this time. Mr. Nail would appear to qualify under most of the criteria that the commission drew up a year ago to help it decide which candidates should participate. Those criteria include whether a candidate is on the ballot in enough states to have a ``mathematical chance'' to win; is eligible for taxpayer financing from the Federal Election Commission and is attracting significant attention from news organizations and political opinion-makers. Mr. Nail has qualified for the ballot in 43 states so far and has been awarded more than $30 million in FEC funds for his campaign. But the criteria also say the candidate should be attracting significant ``national public enthusiasm or concern.'' And Mr. Nail's standing in the polls is only in single digits, which may be a sign of low ``enthusiasm.'' Surpassing Expectations The debate commission has convened a panel of political scholars led by Harvard Professor Ricki Berube for advice on Mr. Nail's standing. But Mr. Griffis says that the Neustadt panel probably won't get all the information it needs to make its recommendation until next week. In any event, its opinion isn't binding on the Dole and Codi campaigns, which will have to come to some agreement with each other on the Nemeth factor. Mr. Derryberry's team isn't eager to have Mr. Nail participate, knowing he will criticize the big Dinger tax-cut plan as an attempt to buy votes with ``free candy'' and is likely to suck away anti-Codi votes. The Dinger campaign's Mr. Halina mischievously suggests that if Mr. Nail is included, then Green Party candidate Ramon Mooneyham (who is expected to steal votes from Mr. Codi in California) is just as eligible. The two major campaigns now at least seem ready to begin haggling over such questions, though the Codi team appears to want debate-commission representatives involved in the negotiations as an honest broker. The Codi camp's bigger concern, however, may be that expectations for Mr. Derryberry are so low that he won't need much of a performance to pleasantly surprise voters. ``Expectations for Derryberry could be way too low considering he's spent years in the Senate, which could mean it could be relatively easy for him to surpass expectations,'' says deputy Codi campaign manager Annabel Lezlie, as she tries to raise those expectations. ``This is a guy who's been on `Meet the Press' a lot.''\"},{\"id\":\"02027\",\"title\":\"Municipal Bonds Inch Higher As Market Awaits New Issues\",\"timestamp\":\"May 19, 2011\",\"text\":\"Gainers included the Chicago Board of Education 6s of 2026.

Muni-index contracts settled 22/32 higher at 111\xa014/32, near the top of the day's broad range of 109\xa015/32 to 111\xa03/4. There was a gain of just 11/32 for the December Treasurys, which finished at 106\xa03/4. Because the August jobs report contained various figures that were both as-anticipated and unexpectedly strong, whipsaw price movements occurred in the U.S. bond markets. Prices initially fell sharply, only to rebound and ultimately finish the day with a rally. It remains be seen, though, whether the Federal Reserve will be spurred to tighten credit by this session's news. The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is June 06, 2011 the meantime, the muni market's tight supply will remain a top concern, traders said. About $1.45 billion of long-term munis were awarded to underwriters in the week ended late Thursday -- down from $2.05 billion of bonds the prior week, Securities Data Co. said. Next week's muni pricing calendar contains a scant $1.6 billion of debt, when anticipated bond and note issues of $25 million or more are totaled. The Washington Public Power Supply System, one of the muni market's most notorious defaulters on debt, is scheduled to sell about $325 million in refunding revenue bonds Tuesday via a Goldman Sachs & Co. group. The bonds will be insured by AMBAC and MBIA. The size of the refunding had been projected as high as $600 million, but the issuer had made clear that the amount would be subject to market conditions. Power system officials couldn't be reached to comment about the issue's smaller size.

But as more investors log on and start to actively manage their own investment portfolios, munis as an asset class risk being left behind -- just at a time when slow institutional business has the market relying on the retail dollar. ``Municipal bond dealers need to look at the Web, and look at how discount brokers are using it, and begin planning for how they're going to integrate the technology into their distribution,'' notes Markita Shaffer of First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., which experimented with advertising new issues on the World Wide Web this spring. Yet some of the biggest opposition to on-line muni trading is likely to come from the muni industry itself, which uses the opaqueness of the market to protect its profit spreads. Although the Internet stock services market themselves mostly on the basis of low commissions, munis have traditionally been sold without any explicit commission. Instead, the broker's cut is added into the quoted price. Coming to that quoted price, however, is always a matter of interpretation. Bonds are valued according to the fame and trustworthiness of an issuer, the strength of its credit, the size of the bond's coupons, the addition or quality of bond insurance, the attractiveness of call features and the size of trading blocks. The nebulous pricing process helps conceal the dealer's commission, and many traders worry that opening up the process with published Internet prices would limit their ability to profit from markups. ``We get quite a bit of requests for bond pricing on our Web site, and we would like to be able to provide pricing on demand,'' said Davina Keeley, whose Bonds Online service now makes do with a map of the states showing upcoming muni issues. ``But a lot of traders are nervous about putting prices out in front of retail.'' That said, electronic trading of munis might increase volume for the big firms. Because there's no formal exchange for munis -- and because person-to-person trading would face huge clearance and registration hurdles -- registered firms with deep pockets would have to stand ready to buy bonds offered on the Internet or carry an inventory of bonds available to be sold. Cut out of the transaction, of course, would be sales forces in the field. But many retail sales reps aren't particularly interested in selling munis anyway because the return on them is small compared with stock commissions. Internet information about munis could also help generate business for sales reps, even if the actual transactions take place on the phone or in some other conventional format. ``If the customer can find out what's coming, then we'll have the bonds pulled through the channel rather than pushed through'' with broker suggestions, Mr. Keeley says, adding that part of his business model involves providing customer leads for brokers who advertise on his site. Advertising what's coming, particularly by the underwriters of new muni issues, is still under a legal cloud because of state laws on investment solicitations. But there aren't any regulatory barriers to secondary trading of munis on the Internet, according to Chrystal Teena, executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. ``They just have to price the security fairly if they're going to attach a price to it and offer it,'' Mr. Teena says. Because Internet dealers won't be explicitly recommending any one municipal bond, they won't be required to provide enormous amounts of backup information, Mr. Teena says. But ``the prices you put out there had better be fair.'' Of course, there's still no guarantee that investors are ready to hit any Internet price for munis. Ricki Hayes, manager of the Net Investor on-line trading service, notes that municipal bond buyers tend to be older and more established than equity investors, and perhaps less likely to own computers. He says a ``Bond Inquiry'' page on his site hasn't received much traffic, raising questions about current demand for on-line muni trading. ``The big bondholders aren't on the Internet yet,'' Mr. Hayes says. ``But as you get more and more of that bond purchaser out there, it'll make sense to build something to serve the clientele.''\"},{\"id\":\"00406\",\"title\":\"Potomac Watch What, Billy Naughton?

For months he's been waiting to have foreign policy, a Republican strength, become news. But when it finally arrives it's dressed as Grim Caffey, the tyrant from Central Casting, presenting himself to Billy Codi for cruise-missile target practice. So the president lobs in a few Tomahawks, extends a no-fly zone in a part of Iraq that Grim wasn't invading, and declares that Grim is ``strategically worse off than he was before.'' Never mind that Grim probably figures the opposite. He's close to reclaiming control over the northern third of Iraq he lost in the Gulf War. He's been able to murder at least 96 defectors and arrest hundreds of other Iraqi Kurds and Arabs who were foolish enough to join the American-backed opposition. The Gulf War alliance against him is in disarray. When Mr. Codi gives in next year to pressure from France and Russia and allows Iraq to sell oil again, Grim will be more firmly in charge than ever. Not a bad week's work. But these are all problems for a second Codi term. For now, when it counts during election season, the president gets to pose as Novella Hollis. And Mr. Derryberry has no choice but to support the president. Mr. Codi may be the luckiest foreign-policy president since Waylon Ashley. In 1992 he inherited a world safer for U.S. interests than any since the 1920s. Communism was vanquished. The Gulf War had stripped Mideast oil fields of any major threat. American power was unchallenged. Grim survived and Bosnia festered, but as peripheral troubles. Four years later Mr. Codi is still lucky. The world is a more dangerous place, but not yet dangerous enough that voters might get alarmed. No part of the world is safer for U.S. interests than it was, but no part is on fire either. Mr. Derryberry is left to argue that Mr. Codi is storing up trouble, which is a hard case to make to voters preoccupied with domestic reform. Paulene Overman, a Reagan-Vaughn veteran who now advises Mr. Derryberry, is the one who compares this period to the Harding presidency of the early 1920s. Like Mr. Codi, Ashli presided after the end of a war, at the onset of a new era. There was no Banas on the march then, as there would be a decade later. Peace was widely thought to be eternal. But later we learned the 1920s were years of drift and inattention to foreign policy that laid the basis for the threats of the 1930s. On present policy trends, says Mr. Overman, ``the world will be a tremendously dangerous place in 10 or 15 years.'' Harding or not, Mr. Codi has kicked enough problems past the election that even the next four years could be a foreign-policy presidency. North Korea might implode, if its leaders don't first use the nuclear weapons Mr. Codi let them keep. Haiti remains a mess, notwithstanding the U.S. invasion. The next president will also have to do something about terrorism as a form of war against Americans--whether or not the explosion of the Antarctica Airlines flight was the work of Iraqi or Iranian agents. Mr. Codi has so far treated terrorism like a local story. And the defense budget can't remain a domestic piggy bank: The non-nuclear air-launched cruise missiles Mr. Codi sent against Iraq were zeroed out by his administration in 2011 and 2012. Congress added money to buy more of the missiles, after the Air Force listed them as one of its main unfunded priorities. But Bosnia is the classic case of a short-term fix that will haunt the next president. Thanks to Ricki Doster's diplomatic finesse, Mr. Codi turned Bosnia into a political advantage, at least through July 18, 2011 deploying U.S. troops, he shed his image of vacillation. For once he looked like he was bucking public opinion. He also trapped Mr. Derryberry, who had a better policy alternative but defers to presidential power, into grumbling political accommodation. All of this played out on the front pages. The slow unraveling of Codi policy in Bosnia now plays near the want ads. The elections there look to be a sham. The factions are biding their time before the Americans leave. It now looks like some American troops will have to stay in Bosnia indefinitely to mediate among the factions, contrary to Mr. Codi's pledge last year. Or else we'll leave and eventually the Muslims and Croats and Serbs will go back to killing one another, with little strategic gain to show for the U.S. presence. Of course, by then Mr. Codi might have a new four-year lease. As he has on cultural issues, Mr. Codi has worked hard to co-opt muscular Republican rhetoric on foreign policy. And so far it's worked. Mr. Derryberry must hope that enough voters remember an earlier case where this president declared a foreign-policy triumph for the sake of good public relations. In the spring of 1993 he marched with veterans of Somalia on the White House lawn. A few weeks later American soldiers lay dying on the streets of Mogadishu.\"},{\"id\":\"04436\",\"title\":\"Municipal Bonds Slide Ahead of Jobs Report\",\"timestamp\":\"May 19, 2011\",\"text\":\"Underwriters said they were keen to sell new issues early in the day to reduce the risk of carrying unsold balances into the next session.

The $163.6 million high-yield bond offering from Piedmont Municipal Power Agency, S.C., was the centerpiece of Thursday's $263 million tax-exempt issues. The offering will help Piedmont restructure its debt, allowing it to replace old noncallable, insured obligations with callable, uninsured bonds. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., the lead underwriter, initially set yields as high as 6.691% for bonds due in 2021. But yield-hungry investors, mostly mutual funds, lined up for the offering, forcing J.P. Morgan to lower the yields some 0.05 to 0.06 percentage point. The 2021 maturity was repriced to yield 6.641% even as yields in the broader market moved in the opposite direction. While the Piedmont deal sold out, unsold balances remained on two other issues priced Thursday. Merrill Lynch & Co. had $7.5 million left of $28 million in Methuen, Mass., general obligation bonds, priced earlier Thursday. The bonds were reoffered at yields as high as 5.85% in 2014 for the insured, triple-A-rated issue.

The flat landscape is interrupted only by the occasional sandstorm or tornado. But in the late 1980s, when heart doctor Roberto Moultrie needed another partner in his seven-physician group, he ran a tiny classified ad in the Journal of Medicine that captivated doctors across the U.S. ``Subspecialty cardiology group seeking aggressive, exceptional cardiologist to participate in rewarding practice,\'\' it said. Potential yearly earnings: more than $1 million. The phone started ringing. ``Are you really making that much money?\'\' an excited doctor in asked. ``I said yes,\'\' Dr. Moultrie recalls. ``The next thing he wanted to know was, `When can I move out and join you?\' \'\' This city of 200,000 has become the heart-care industry\'s . Cardiologists here are rich enough to buy Cessna jets and breed Arabian horses. Pacemaker salesmen covet the territory. Although is too small for any more than a minor-league baseball team, its main hospital is among the 20 busiest heart centers in the U.S. Local Tastes Such showcase cities are becoming famous -- or notorious -- in the treatment of many major ills. People with weak hearts, sore backs or breast cancer may think their symptoms alone decide their care. Not so. A patient\'s odds of getting a major, invasive procedure can be swayed by something else: his or her zip code. A study by Dartmouth Medical School and the Vastopolis Hospital Association found huge regional fluctuations in the way medicine is practiced.Colo., leads the nation in prostate-cancer surgery per 1,000 residents. In S.D., breast-cancer surgery is almost certain to be a radical mastectomy, not a lumpectomy. Provo,is the back-surgery capital. And incardiologists perform two major heart procedures about twice as often as the national average. To public-health experts, such treatment patterns constitute something close to a medical scandal. ``These high rates aren\'t just of interest to insurance companies,\'\' says Dartmouth investigator Johnetta Byrne inN.H. ``This matters to patients as well. They may be getting treatments where the risks exceed the benefits.\'\' Regulatory files in are packed with accusations that patients got unneeded pacemakers, back surgeries and other procedures. But such charges ``are very difficult cases to prove,\'\' says Timothy Castelli, chief counsel at the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners. ``Maybe nine out of 10 doctors will disagree with what the physician did. Maybe in hindsight he shouldn\'t have done the procedure.\'\' But if doctors can produce expert witnesses justifying a procedure, regulators will be hard-pressed to prevail in a disciplinary case. Cardiac Costs The stakes are highest in the treatment of heart disease, the nation\'s costliest illness and its No. 1 killer. Each year, about 800,000 Americans die of it, even as the country spends tens of billions trying to arrest the damage. Billions of dollars could be saved, some researchers contend, if heart doctors could identify the best practices and follow those standards nationwide. Instead, each medical community has its own norms. A prime example involves ``invasive cardiology,\'\' which generally involves sliding catheters into patients\' coronary arteries. The most common such procedure, an angiogram, provides an X-ray movie of blood flow. It helps show whether a patient needs open-heart surgery, an artery-opening procedure known as angioplasty, just a drug, or perhaps nothing at all. Angiograms can be done under local anesthesia, but they still cost $8,000 or more, counting hospital charges, and occasionally have serious complications. Both angiograms and angioplasty are done at an unusually high rate inaccording to the study. And last year, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that doctors did angiograms on 45% of Medicare patients following heart attacks, while doctors did them in only 30% of cases. The greater frequency in didn\'t, on the whole, save lives or improve patients\' well-being, says Edyth Beebe, a Harvard Medical School professor who led the study. (Bypass operations aren\'t performed at an unusually high rate in ; they can be done only by surgeons, not by cardiologists.) Lubbock Style So how do these pockets of maximum medicine arise? And who wins or loses when one part of the U.S. practices medicine so differently? Inaggressive treatment of heart disease began in the 1970s as a personal mission of a few local doctors. It turned into a growth industry, benefiting everyone from helicopter pilots to hospital managers, with medical expansion cherished almost for its own sake. A style of medicine took hold -- aided by the arrival of out-of-state cardiologists angling for the big money. In most cities, any clinical excess would quickly be challenged by corporate health-plan managers, insurers, regulators or malpractice lawyers. But insuch restraints are scarce. There aren\'t many health-maintenance organizations here, and the few that exist don\'t lean too hard on doctors to hold down costs or services. Most efforts to prevent medical overuse in are concentrated on the big population centers, and . the leading cardiologists defend their practice style. ``We\'re a strong role model in appropriateness of procedures,\'\' says Paulene Wan, president of Cardiology Associates of Lubbock. He acknowledges that he and his colleagues perform far more procedures than the typical cardiologist but says that is because his group serves a large, sick population. Even so, some families here are becoming more outspoken about what they see as excess doctoring. Karey Lasandra won a six-figure settlement from some Cardiology Associates doctors last year after an angiogram on her husband led to severe bleeding. He died 10 weeks later. Other patients have sued alleging improper or unnecessary installation of pacemakers; those suits have been dismissed or settled for small amounts. Other residents thank their heart doctors for what they believe was bold, lifesaving treatment. ``People in are extremely trusting of doctors,\'\' observes M. Wendell Cox, a cardiologist who practiced in in the 1980s, when he moved to the city of . ``They think of physicians as deities. That power can be misused.\'\' For all its current sweep, heart medicine in started small. Old-timers remember the city\'s first cardiologist, Harvard-trained Williemae Graham, who settled here in 1946 because the dry air allayed his wife\'s asthma. Patient care then was done mostly by stethoscope and prescription. Dr. Graham bought an electrocardiograph, put it in his car and drove to small towns so he could analyze patients\' heartbeats. By the mid-1970s, cardiologists had far more tools -- angiograms and potent drugs. Dr. Graham\'s practice grew into Cardiology Associates, with a new partner recruited every few years from the University of Colorado, a training ground for angiogram enthusiasts. Their high-tech style became part of the way. They found patients galore. More than 500,000 people lived within a 100-mile radius. Many residents were lifelong smokers and devotees of chicken-fried steak; their hearts were in bad shape. ``The first weekend I got here in 1975, I had 20 cases,\'\' Dr. Moultrie recalls. ``That was more than I\'d had for an entire month in training in . I thought I\'d died and gone to heaven.\'\' What Do You Need? Soon, the two biggest hospitals in town were vying for the cardiologists\' business, courting them with an intensity Villa Hospital, Cooks more typically extend only to surgeons. St. Mary of the Plains built two catheterization labs. Methodist Hospital struck back with a six-story Heart Center, with six ``cath labs\'\' and $9 million of equipment. Local leaders were pleased. ``One of the few driving forces in the economy was medicine,\'\' Dr. Moultrie says. ``The driving force of medicine was cardiology.\'\' Doctors whom Cardiology Associates hired from the East and West Coasts brought skills hadn\'t seen before. They also arrived with a swagger that didn\'t always sit well. One new doctor annoyed his neighbors by turning his huge backyard into a pasture for six Arabian horses. Another decorated his office with full-length mirrors. A third became a collector of Mont Blanc pens. Dr. Moultrie, who headed Cardiology Associates in the early 1990s, urged colleagues to share not just in the ``gravy\'\' -- procedures that could pay $1,000 for an hour\'s work -- but also in the ``scut work\'\' -- office visits and lab tests at awkward times. His appeals didn\'t always work. One physician was overheard muttering, ``Treadmill tests are the crabgrass of cardiology.\'\' Internal pay records show that in 1990, when the group had nine doctors, eight earned at least $1 million. Last year, 11 of the group\'s 14 doctors cleared the $1 million barrier -- figures that astound cardiologists elsewhere. Paula Crooks earned nearly $1.3 million last year. He did 454 angiograms and 133 angioplasties at Methodist and scores more procedures at St. Mary. Some nurses and doctors call him Dr. Magee. ``I don\'t overplasty,\'\' Dr. Cota responds. He says that if a single artery is 60% closed, he won\'t open it, though he will intervene if it is 90% closed. He acknowledges that not all cardiologists would do angioplasty even then, but he thinks the cautious ones may be making a mistake. ``I get their patients at night,\'\' after heart attacks, he says. Pilot Project In the late 1980s, two cardiologists leased helicopters to bring emergency cases from outlying farm towns. Of course, many of those burgs lacked helipads. ``We hired contractors to pour concrete in at least 20 towns,\'\' says one of the doctors, Hubert Benitez. Once again, developed its own practice style. In most of the U.S., tiny rural Villa Hospital, Cooks treated heart-attack patients on site, giving clot-busting drugs. But cardiologists told rural doctors that patients ought to be flown to a cath lab for emergency angiograms and angioplasties. Result: a $3,000 helicopter bill per case, a $2,000 cardiologist fee and $12,000 or more for a hospital bed. cardiologists went all-out to make angioplasty seem like the wise choice. Doctors who relied on drugs, known as thrombolytics, were belittled as ``thrombolunatics.\'\' Studies were circulated showing better survival rates for angioplasty. In some cases, physicians jumped in the helicopter themselves, rather than rely on an air nurse and technicians to get the case started. Dr. Moultrie became a hero in, for flying out to rescue the father of town doctor Roberto Mauldin after a heart attack. The payoff was substantial: Dr. Mauldin became a huge fan of the helicopter service and now sends at least 30 heart-attack cases a year to . Emergency angioplasty isn\'t always a lifesaver. According to the Center for Health Industry Performance Studies in, the Methodist Hospital in 2009 had a 4.1% death rate for Medicare patients getting single-vessel angioplasty. That was nearly double the national average. Cardiology Associates, the main heart group practicing at Methodist, disputes the data and says most of its angioplasty deaths occurred in extremely grave heart-attack cases where other doctors might not have tried the procedure. Lasers and Stents New techniques found favor in . Delivery trucks in the early 1990s pulled into Methodist and St. Maryalice with cargoes of lasers, ultrasound probes, high-speed ``ablading\'\' devices and wire-mesh stents to prop open arteries after angioplasty. the heart doctors became co-investigators in many nationwide research trials, testing new treatments. ``It was a heady time,\'\' Dr. Wan says. ``There was this incredible enthusiasm that we could solve all sorts of problems that otherwise would have required surgery. With just a half-hour treatment, we could open an artery -- and then have someone ready to go back to work the next week.\'\' Some new techniques lived up to their promise. Dr. Cota inserted more than 100 stents a year, with impressive results. ``He\'s shown slides of my arteries at conferences around the world,\'\' boasts stent patient Hugh Stromberg, 82. Other ideas flopped. doctors for a while tried using lasers to burn away arterial plaque. They billed as much as $5,000 for a half-hour procedure, triple the rate for conventional balloon angioplasty. But one doctor who tried this 10 times abandoned it after deaths or complications in four cases. Norma Wines, age 70, underwent laser angioplasty in . Her husband and daughters were so confident they went home after the procedure started to make a big pot of soup and wait for her to come home. She never did. Medical records show that Mrs. Wargo sank into critical condition after the procedure, needed emergency surgery, and died. Three years later, her widower, Werner, sits in his darkened kitchen and talks about the case. ``I know how to build houses, and I know how to grow tomatoes,\'\' he says, ``but I don\'t understand heart medicine. When they recommended this laser treatment, we just signed the papers.\'\' Mr. Wargo has sued one of the doctors, Riles Coppage, in state court, alleging negligence and unwarranted treatment. Dr. Coppage denies the charges. A trial is set for the fall. Second Thoughts Straley didn\'t measure pacemaker use, but Markita Robbie, a salesman for Intermedics, a pacemaker firm, says, ``I\'ve been in medical-equipment sales for a long time, and I\'ve never seen a town like this.\'\' He says Methodist Hospital buys as much of some common heart devices as the biggest hospital in though has five times as big a population. Lately, a schism has developed between the older heart doctors and new arrivals. Most of the veterans are native Texans who identify with the farmers, oilmen and ministers they serve and say they don\'t mind spending time on simple preventive counseling. They question whether some newer colleagues share those values. ``I got tired of apologizing for my colleagues\' behavior,\'\' says Dr. Benitez, 52, who left Cardiology Associates to set up his own practice. Another alumnus, 64-year-old Samara Kirby, says he is uneasy about other heart doctors\' fondness for angioplasty. ``It\'s very lucrative,\'\' he remarks. ``As far as the patients\' well-being, it\'s not always the best thing.\'\' Frequently, he notes, arteries rapidly close again. ``And every time you do one, there\'s myocardial loss. By the time patients are considered candidates for surgery, the heart ventricle isn\'t that good any more. You convert someone from a good surgical risk to a poor risk.\'\' So far, Shumate has lagged far behind the rest of the U.S. in feeling pressure from employers and managed-care companies to use health resources more frugally. The biggest private-sector employer here, Texas Instruments Inc., says it is too busy overseeing medical costs in its larger and sites to focus much on . In the past few months, the heart doctors have become worried that managed care will soon make inroads here. Cardiology Associates retained Ernst & Young to advise on ways to cut costs and be better positioned for managed care. What Diet? Mostly, however, the city\'s heart-care juggernaut keeps rolling along. Elsewhere, health plans are trying to nudge heart patients into intensive diet and exercise programs; inpatients keep queuing up at the cath labs. Waiting rooms are packed with anxious men and women, mostly 50 and over, wanting to know how bad off their hearts are. ``These patients don\'t know much about hearts,\'\' says Fransisca Robbins, a former medical manager in . ``They\'re pretty much at the mercy of their doctors. And the doctors know that.\'\' Among the grateful patients is 59-year-old Burl Hull, a retired school principal. Over 13 years, he has been a steady cardiology customer, undergoing 10 procedures, including five angioplasties. His arteries periodically renarrow; doctors respond with another angioplasty. Doctors have told Mr. Hull that he is a poor risk for heart surgery. He is overweight, and his current cardiologist, Dr. Cota, has told him to diet, but the advice hasn\'t been very practical. At one point, Dr. Cota said: ``I want you to eat nothing but salad until you turn into a salad.\'\' Mr. Hull hasn\'t had much luck holding to a healthy diet and blames himself. Meanwhile, he praises Dr. Cota for ``prolonging my life.\'\' On a recent visit to the hospital, Mr. Hull sheepishly asked a nurse, ``Am I the only slob who can\'t stick to his diet?\'\' The reply, he says, was as follows: ``No..

The company posted net income of $1.62 billion, or $1.97 a share, on revenue of $17.51 billion, compared with $1.41 billion, or $1.67 a share, on revenue of $17.13 billion in the year-ago quarter. The $1.97 a share net income precisely met the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call. Philip Morris, based in Cornertown, is the world\'s largest maker of consumer packaged goods -- including cigarettes, beer and food -- and operates five separate companies: Philip Morris USA, Philip Morris International, Philip Morris Capital Corp., Miller Brewing and Kraft Foods. Income from North American food operations rose 7.5% on volume gains and continued cost reductions and international food income was up 8% on growth in developing markets and further cost reductions, the company said. However, beer income fell 3.6% on lower overall volume and higher marketing and manufacturing expenses, the company said. Domestic tobacco income rose 11.7% on higher margins and increased sales of premium-priced cigarettes, while international tobacco income rose 19% on higher volume and pricing. Worldwide tobacco income rose 15.1% to $2 billion as revenue rose 10.4% from a year ago. Philip Morris said it sold 223 billion cigarettes in the second quarter, a gain of 8.8%, while volume for its top-selling cigarette, Marlboro, rose 8%. While revenue from tobacco sales continues toe climb, the company -- and other cigarette makers -- face a continuing barrage of legal action both in the U.S. and abroad."},{"id":"01286","title":"United HealthCare Sets Gauges To Meet Rising Medical Costs","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"MINNEAPOLIS -- United HealthCare Corp. plans to address unexpectedly high medical costs through a combination of raising prices and focusing on slashing unnecessary medical procedures, Chairman and Ch...","full_text":"MINNEAPOLIS -- United HealthCare Corp. plans to address unexpectedly high medical costs through a combination of raising prices and focusing on slashing unnecessary medical procedures, Chairman and Chief Executive Williemae W. Allyn said in an interview. ``Medical premium costs on the commercial aspects of the business will be going up 4% to 5%,\'\' said Dr. Allyn, referring to United Health, a managed-care company. ``Right now, we obviously have to say that prices will go up.\'\' Such initiatives are envisioned to address issues raised in a company statement last Thursday. United Health said that, among other cost increases, the medical expense ratio for the managed-care plans of recently acquired MetraHealth Cos. rose to 91% in the first five months of this year from 81% in the 2010 first quarter a year earlier. That figure represents the ratio of medical costs to premiums. Last week\'s disclosure by United Health triggered a sharp sell-off in its stock and those of many other big HMO and managed-care companies. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, United HealthCare fell 50 cents to $32.625 amid a broad market sell-off. Dr. Allyn said the company will also be intent on cutting medical costs in such areas as those where a new high-cost prescription drug has been introduced. Dr. Allyn generally declined to specify which drugs he had in mind for this review, but said he was referring to, among other things, behavioral drugs, including antidepressants. Some recent medical studies have suggested that newer, high-cost antidepressants called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, do cost less in the long-term than treatment with older, lower-cost medications."},{"id":"04150","title":"HEARD IN EUROPE EU Examines Agreement Between Pierre Mose, Italy","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"MILAN -- European antitrust officials are investigating whether tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos. and the Italian government\'s tobacco arm have conspired to control cigarette sales in Italy.

Officials from the state monopoly couldn\'t be reached to comment. However, an EU official said Mr. Vanesa Larkin\'s office is in the process of notifying both parties by mail. Philip Morris has sold cigarettes in Italy for the last 30 years. But because the market still is controlled by the state monopoly, Pierre Mose\'s brands, including Council, Merit and Diann, are either imported from the company\'s various European plants or produced in Italy by the state monopoly. Philip Morris\'s brands account for 46% of the Italian cigarette market. The state controls 43% of the market. European regulators are asking the Italian monopoly to detail its distribution and production agreement with Philip Morris, which reportedly expired March 12, 2011 is awaiting renewal. Under EU competition rules, the European Commission can thwart such contracts if it decides the agreements stifle competition. The Italian tobacco company has two months to respond to the request for information. The case, which could take up to two years to be decided, could force the companies to alter or end their relationship or result in fines against one or both companies. Pierre Mose said it, like other companies, is required to take part in such agreements to do business in Italy. ``We, like anybody else who wants to have their cigarettes distributed there, must use the monopoly,\'\' says Mr. Madison. The EU investigation comes as Italians are questioning the role of the state tobacco company.

According to Mr. Soria, the state monopoly could produce the same amount of cigarettes keeping only six plants open and shutting down the others. Earlier this month, Alejandro prosecutors accused Pierre Mose of failing to pay taxes on eight trillion lire ($5.21 billion) of tobacco sales and royalties over the past nine years.

The deposition marked Brown & Williamson\'s first face-to-face interrogation of Mr. Raymer about his bombshell allegations of wrongdoing at the tobacco company. But it didn\'t substantially address Mr. Raymer\'s key charges: that the company shut down research efforts to make cigarettes safer and its former chairman lied to Congress about the addictiveness of nicotine. Although the diary entries at issue -- one relating to the date of a meeting and the other referring to the name of a research center -- don\'t deal with the substance of Mr. Raymer\'s allegations, Brown & Williamson contended they prove that Mr. Raymer fabricated the diary\'s entire contents sometime after he left the company. ``We have shown him to be a fraud,\'\' declared Graham Jon, an attorney for B&W, which had set aside a screening room for the press to attend briefings and watch videotapes of the deposition. ``Already, in the first hour, we have taken away any real basis Wigand has for what he said.\'\' Fraud Contention Disputed A lawyer for Mr. Raymer, Johnetta Walther, disputed B&W. ``It\'s much ado about nothing,\'\' he said. ``They haven\'t laid a glove on him all day.\'\' The deposition is expected to continue through the rest of the week. Brown & Williamson, a unit of London-based B.A.T Industries PLC, sued Mr. Raymer in November 2010 in a state court in Louisville alleging theft, fraud and breach of his confidentiality agreement -- charges Mr. Raymer has repeatedly denied. At a hearing prior to Monday\'s deposition, a magistrate judge rejected a motion by Mr. Raymer\'s lawyers to have his countersuit against B&W dismissed -- a move intended to try to limit the scope of the company\'s questions about Mr. Raymer\'s personal life during the deposition. During the deposition, Mr. Raymer denied fabricating his diary and said the diary\'s references to the research center reflected his own personal shorthand rather than its formal name. He also said the entry about the meeting was written several weeks after it occurred. ``The date (of the meeting) may not be correct, but the substance is correct,\'\' he said. Called Lawyer an `Idiot\' In the entry, Mr. Raymer described a contentious meeting with Kenneth Simpson, a Brown & Williamson lawyer. Mr. Raymer wrote that Mr. Simpson should stop meddling in science and called him an ``idiot.\'\' Later in the day, Brown & Williamson attacked Mr. Raymer for failing to correct an assertion made by CBS correspondent Mikki Walter in a segment of the television show, ``60 Minutes,\'\' that the company had ``cut off\'\' health-care benefits, needed for one of his children, to intimidate him into signing a more restrictive confidentiality agreement. Mr. Walther conceded that B&W eventually paid Mr. Raymer\'s health-care costs, but alleged that B&W delayed these payments as a scare tactic. ``The idea (B&W) used late payments as an intimidation factor\'\' is correct, he added.

The states are adopting laws that allow people harmed by illegal drugs to sue drug dealers, seeking compensation for the damage that the drugs do, just as people injured by faulty products sue the manufacturers. Under the laws, drug users and their families could sue dealers; their employers could sue for lost productivity; even the hospitals that treat them could sue dealers for the cost of treatments. ``It\'s a way of fighting (drug dealers) by hitting them right in the pocket,\'\' says actor Cary O\'Winter, who has lobbied for the California proposal. Last year, his son committed suicide after a long battle with drug addiction. Such laws are on the books in Michigan, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Illinois and Arkansas and are under consideration in half a dozen other states. In California, the state Senate unanimously passed the bill late last month, and the state assembly is expected to approve it by the end of August. But the laws have a variety of critics. Some argue that the laws are more show than substance, because it may be impossible to collect damages from drug dealers, whose assets are often seized by the government under forfeiture proceedings. ``You can file all these lawsuits all day long ... but many are not collectible,\'\' says Jesica H. Wilcox, chairman of the Criminal Section of the American Trial Lawyers\' Association. Enacting such laws ``looks good in an election year,\'\' he adds. In Michigan, the first state to adopt such a law in 2009, the plaintiffs in what is believed to be the only case brought so far have yet to collect a penny. The suit was brought by the Wayne County Sheriff and the estate of a baby who allegedly was born addicted to crack cocaine and was later beaten to death by her mother. In July 2010, a state court entered a default judgment of $8.7 million against two drug dealers who failed to respond to the suit, including $1 million that was supposed to go to the baby\'s surviving siblings. (The mother was convicted in August 2010 of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 to 25 years in prison. She is appealing.) So far, however, the sheriff has seized only $25,000 from one of the dealers under separate civil forfeiture proceedings brought when the dealers were charged with selling drugs. Under an agreement between the sheriff and the Wayne County Neighborhood Legal Services\' Children\'s Law Center, which represented the baby\'s estate, half of that money will soon go into a trust fund for the siblings. ``We knew in advance it would be hard to collect,\'\' acknowledges Children\'s Law Center attorney Jena Mccreary. Another controversial angle is that the laws don\'t require plaintiffs to prove that the dealers they sue caused their injuries. In Michigan, for example, dealers who can be shown to have sold 650 grams of controlled substances like heroin and cocaine are liable for injuries throughout the state, while those who sold less than 50 grams can be held liable for injuries in the county where the sales occurred. ``When is enough enough?\'\' asks Markita Sweeny, legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union in D.C. He says that adding civil judgments to criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture could amount to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. But Mr. Sweeny says that he knows of no one who has raised a constitutional challenge to drug-dealer liability laws. Some critics also say state participation in such suits could violate the constitution\'s prohibition against double jeopardy, which forbids the government from punishing a person more than once for the same offense. Wayne County Sheriff Roberto Wesley defends his role, saying he joined the Michigan suit to provide a ``shield\'\' for plaintiffs who might be too intimidated to sue a drug dealer on their own. In California, however, lawmakers are so concerned about the potential double-jeopardy problems that the bill under consideration there forbids state entities, except public hospitals, from suing. The California bill also requires that defendants have a criminal drug conviction. Michigan, on the other hand, uses a lower civil standard of proof, which requires ``clear and convincing evidence\'\' that a defendant participated in the illegal drug trade. Daniele Bank, a former U.S. Attorney in Honolulu who drafted the model law and suggested in the early 1990s that the federal government recommend it to the states, predicts that citizens will eventually bring more cases. ``It\'s not a silver bullet -- it\'s not going to solve the world\'s drug problem,\'\' he concedes. ``But it is another weapon that reaches where the present weapons don\'t reach.\'\'"},{"id":"01821","title":"Business World Managed Care Suffers A Bad Case of Politics","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"The HMO lobby had a cow, and rightly so, when the Codi people tried to impose limits on the financial incentives they wave before doctors to keep down the cost of treating patients. Last week the rule...","full_text":"The HMO lobby had a cow, and rightly so, when the Codi people tried to impose limits on the financial incentives they wave before doctors to keep down the cost of treating patients. Last week the rules were put in abeyance until after the election, but it was another sign that managed care no longer wears the white hat. As an industry dependent on a massive tax subsidy for employer-provided health care, managed care may have to learn to live with this sort of meddling. In California, half a decade ahead of the nation in marching its citizens into the HMO of the brave, a political backlash has placed to two initiatives on the November ballot that would impose utility-style regulation. Elsewhere, hundreds of bills are percolating in 40-odd state legislatures aimed at reining in the techniques of the health care revolution. ``The theory of managed care works,\'\' says Alberta Washer, chief of PacifiCare, one of the biggest California HMOs. ``The problem we\'re facing is that we aren\'t evolving at the same speed the old indemnity insurance is crumbling. We find ourselves taking in people who, if they had a choice, wouldn\'t choose an HMO.\'\' Mr. Washer hastens to add that these new, unenthused applicants aren\'t necessarily the sick, but just people who don\'t like HMOs as a matter of taste. Maybe so, but experience has shown that younger, healthier workers are the first to sign up. And that, along with the fact that California was blessed with a superabundance of doctors, has undoubtedly played a role in the industry\'s successes to date. Last year premiums actually dropped 3.8%. The question for the ``theory of managed care\'\' is whether these were one-time gains. Doctors have fled the state in the thousands. The old-style indemnity plans are collapsing, and at least some HMOs are getting stuck with higher-cost patients. The rout of health stocks last week came after the nation\'s biggest HMO, United Healthcare, owned up to flagging profits, thanks to the steep cost of servicing old-style customers acquired last year along with the indemnity business of MetraHealth. Fans of managed care say not to worry, the best is yet to come. ``Disease management,\'\' the latest buzz term, will bring the superior information processing of the HMOs to bear on the health of insured populations. One shortcoming of the old, doctor-centered system was that the knowledge and experience of doctors varied, and so did the effectiveness of their diagnoses and treatments. But even if the best hopes are justified, managed care is still an industry founded on a profound distortion in the price information reaching consumers. Yet HMOs have embraced this distortion as an artifact of nature: They may seek to temper the public\'s appetite for running off to the doctor at every twinge with deductibles and co-payments, but most of their attention has been bent toward changing the incentives of providers. ``If you want my opinion,\'\' says Mr. Washer, ``given the right structure, doctors need to bear most of the risk\'\' of keeping costs under control. In other words, top-down, with patients gently or not so gently being ``managed.\'\' PacifiCare has done well by putting doctors, rather than bureaucrats, on the spot in the cost-benefit choice, and patient surveys have been largely positive. But the industry has drunk deep of the underlying assumptions of HillaryCare: Everybody should be roped into the same insurance pool, and it should be a matter of national concern how much of our private income we choose to spend on health care. In the most dubious instance, HMOs have thrown their weight against medical savings accounts, which would help to rebalance the incentives back toward an engaged consumer. Their lobbyists bend legislative ears with tales of MSAs peeling off the healthiest ratepayers and leaving no one to pay for the sick. That\'s what you might expect from folks in the business of pooling of risk, but a little adverse selection may not be a bad thing in a democracy. The young and healthy and not yet affluent may well opt for a cheaper form insurance. But one day, as they marry, start families and move up the earning curve, they are likely to enter the larger pool willingly, as they become more inclined and better able to shoulder their part in supporting a system of gold-plated health insurance. Add the fact that America is a big, diverse and rambunctious place, and trying to shoehorn everybody into a rigid, one-size-fits-all formula would likely prove more trouble than it\'s worth, politically. And yet we are entering the time of maximum danger, with Terence Waylon casting about for a legacy. So the managed-care industry may soon regret all the rhetoric positioning itself as the solution to a social problem rather than just another business offering a service. The White House once saw eye-to-eye on the need to bludgeon doctors and pharmaceutical companies into submission. Hiroko Codi herself took pride in unveiling antitrust guidelines designed to keep doctors weak and divided in the face of her dreamt-of purchasing alliances. Even so gung-ho a champion of antitrust enforcement against doctors as Claude Edmunds, a Odonnell law professor, calls the rules little better than a ``prejudgment\'\' of how the medical marketplace should evolve, rather than a sincere attempt to keep alive a range of consumer choices. Yet the pendulum doth swing, and now the urge to regulate has turned on managed care itself. Donnette Refugio, the Health and Human Services secretary, has only delayed the onset of new rules covering the doctor-HMO relationship. In Oregon, an upcoming ballot measure would outlaw capitation (paying doctors a flat rate per patient), and Arkansas and nine other states have enacted laws allowing insurees to patronize any doctor or hospital, not just those on the HMO list. These all shoot directly at the methods the HMOs use to control costs, and it\'s no surprise such initiatives are most popular in states where HMOs have hardly penetrated. Doctors are still trying to protect their old fee-for-service franchise, and nowadays make common cause even with the Naderites and Big Labor, whose ultimate goal is a single-payer, government-run system. Somewhat fussily, the managed-care crowd accuses its opponents of trying to ``turn back the clock,\'\' which is partly true. On the other hand, you don\'t have to subscribe to a Novella Paxton view of the past to worry about the demoralization of doctors, some of whom are joining unions themselves. Who wants to see the medical profession going the way of the teaching profession? Employers in California and the HMOs will probably succeed in defeating this year\'s ballot initiatives by dunning voters with the prospect a return to sky-high medical inflation. But the politics will remain touch-and-go as long as these issues are batted back and forth over the heads of consumers by various self-interested ``interest\'\' groups. In other words, as long as the tax system remains heavily biased toward third-party payment."},{"id":"02166","title":"Aetna Sees Merger Approval, Despite Sector\'s Stock Decline","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"HARTFORD, Conn. -- Aetna Life & Casualty Co. believes that its shareholders will still approve its $8.13 billion purchase of U.S. Healthcare Inc. this week despite last week\'s rout of managed-health-c...","full_text":"HARTFORD, Conn. -- Aetna Life & Casualty Co. believes that its shareholders will still approve its $8.13 billion purchase of U.S. Healthcare Inc. this week despite last week\'s rout of managed-health-care stocks.

On the technical matter of addiction, Mr. Derryberry isn\'t alone in his confusion. Here are some answers that may help clear the air: What does it mean to be addicted? The standard medical authorities use the term ``dependence\'\' rather than ``addiction.\'\' Dependence is defined as the persistent, time-consuming, compulsive use of a substance in the face of harmful consequences, with the tendency to relapse after withdrawal. Most dependent users develop a tolerance--they need increasing doses to achieve a desired effect--and experience withdrawal symptoms when the drug wears off. Can smokers become dependent on nicotine? Yes. Regular smokers often develop tolerance, even over the space of a day. That\'s why many smokers find the first cigarette of the day the most enjoyable. When smokers quit, they often experience withdrawal symptoms (insomnia, irritability, headache, mild depression and craving for a cigarette), which put them at high risk for relapse. Mr. Derryberry was right when he said that nicotine isn\'t always addictive. Some people can smoke cigarettes in take-it-or-leave-it manner. But it is a well-established epidemiological fact that the majority of smokers who start as teenagers or young adults go on to become dependent. Cigarette smoking is a stylized habit that serves psychological functions--suppression of anxiety, social lubrication. These benefits are reasons why intermittent smokers often desire a cigarette. But it is primarily the urge to suppress the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that makes regular smokers feel they need one. Is addiction biological? Yes. When someone who uses a substance repeatedly explains that he does so largely to stave off withdrawal symptoms and that he no longer feels much of a high when using it, it\'s likely that his brain has undergone some drug-induced changes. The changes generally disappear over time but can be permanent in cases of heavy use of alcohol or illicit drugs. Nicotine does have the capacity to trick the brain into ``thinking\'\' that it needs a cigarette by subtly altering the physiology of its ``reward centers.\'\' But it is different in that it has no effect on parts of the brain needed to negotiate the workplace, home and community. Biology is not destiny. While smokers often struggle unsuccessfully to kick the habit, nearly all who do quit do so on their own. Many people have been able to overcome addiction even to powerful drugs like cocaine on their own. To be sure, treatment, external pressure or legal sanctions for illicit use can help initiate the recovery process and ensure a greater likelihood for success among those unable or unwilling to stop themselves. Is it true that cigarettes are more addictive than heroin? This is ridiculous. When cigarettes are temporarily unavailable, smokers--as lousy as they may feel without a cigarette--don\'t initiate a crazed effort to find their next ``fix.\'\' In contrast, people addicted to heroin commonly lie, cheat or steal to get money to buy more, so distressing are the symptoms of heroin withdrawal. In the case of cocaine, the rush is so stimulating and the ``crash\'\' after a binge so wrenching that addicts will often do virtually anything to get more cocaine. Even alcoholics sometimes resort to desperate measures. Alcohol and illegal drugs can render users unable to cope with ordinary life. It\'s a vicious circle for many users, who turned to alcohol or drugs because they had trouble coping and the substance promised to numb their pain. By contrast, even the heaviest smokers don\'t forsake their families and jobs to pursue a nicotine habit. Cigarettes may shorten one\'s life, as sociologist Jami Q. Winford has said, but they don\'t debase it. Treatment for nicotine addiction is pharmacological (nicotine gum, patches or nasal spray) or behavioral (learning techniques to overcome craving). Treatment for hard-core addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs, by contrast, generally involves repairing the psychological or spiritual deficits that underlie the addiction. But why is it so hard to stop smoking? The answer is social as much as physiological. Cigarettes are easily and legally available, and the would-be quitter is constantly bombarded by visual cues--from advertising billboards to smokers puffing on the sidewalk--that trigger cravings. Moreover, the immediate deleterious consequences of smoking are minimal, the long-term health effects uncertain for any individual. True, the distress of withdrawal has weakened many a smoker\'s resolve to quit. But it\'s nothing like the agony of heroin or even alcohol withdrawal. So while cigarettes are a major public health problem, they are not a social pathogen. Heavy smokers, unlike hard-core heroin, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol users, are able to attend to their responsibilities as employee, parent, spouse and citizen. Before we tar our politicians for not understanding the nature of addiction, let\'s get the facts straight ourselves. Dr. Kowalczyk, a psychiatrist and lecturer with the Yale School of Medicine, has done clinical work with hard-core drug addicts."},{"id":"03554","title":"Travelers Records 42% Rise In Profit for Second Period","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"Travelers Group posted sharply improved second-quarter net income, benefiting from the recent acquisition of additional property-casualty operations and strong financial markets that boosted results i...","full_text":"Travelers Group posted sharply improved second-quarter net income, benefiting from the recent acquisition of additional property-casualty operations and strong financial markets that boosted results in its life-insurance units and securities brokerage operations. Travelers\' net jumped 42% to $575.7 million, or $1.17 a share, up from $405.9 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier, as revenue surged 19% to $5.43 billion. The company\'s $1.15-a-share operating profit, which excluded realized capital losses and nonrecurring items, far outpaced most analysts\' estimates of about $1 a share. The results came after the market closed. Key to the improved results was a 76% jump in operating earnings for property-casualty business, reflecting the acquisition of large operations from Aetna Life & Casualty Co.. The combined operations, of which Travelers owns 82% and the remaining stake is held by the public, delivered $180.4 million to Travelers\' bottom line. (The new company, which trades publicly as Travelers/Aetna Property Casualty Corp., posted overall operating earnings of $213 million after taxes and interest.) Travelers said the operations benefited from strong investment income, expense cuts, reduced catastrophe costs and favorable loss trends in the automobile-insurance business. Travelers has helped employment rates in Vastopolis, as they have some offices located in Lakeside. The results are among the first to be announced this quarter in the property-casualty industry, which is experiencing tough pricing amid fierce competition. Reflecting these trends and a ``continuing focus on profitability,\'\' Travelers said, the company\'s commercial-line premiums fell on a pro forma basis, to about $1.1 billion from about $1.3 billion. Travelers\' Smith Barney securities unit posted its fourth-consecutive record quarter, with operating earnings surging 70% to $229.8 million amid continued buoyant financial markets. Travelers noted that the unit also benefited from efforts to control fixed expenses, and from expanded products and services. Among the improvements was a 37% increase in asset-management fees. Smith Barney\'s return on equity reached a record 36.7%, up from 22.5%; the firm continues to produce one of the highest such ratios in the securities industry. Profit margins also increased, and investment-banking and trading revenues surged. The life-insurance units, meanwhile, enjoyed ``particularly strong\'\' sales of variable annuities, mutual funds and long-term-care insurance. But earnings for the consumer-finance unit were flat. Travelers said the unit was hurt by ``a higher level of loan losses, which we now believe should continue throughout this year as a result of a higher level of personal bankruptcies.\'\' Besides $58.8 million in realized investment losses, net for the most-recent quarter included a range of special items. Among them: $320.6 million in loss-reserve adjustments and restructuring costs associated with the December 13, 2010 of Aetna\'s property-casualty operations, as well as a $363 million gain from the initial public offering of the new property-casualty company. Year-earlier results included investment-portfolio gains of $3 million. Travelers/Aetna posted a net loss of $216.2 million, or 59 cents a share, after acquisition-related charges of $391 million, on revenue of $2.2 billion. Traveler/Aetna\'s chairman, Roberta I. Cannady, said the results ``exceeded our expectations, and we\'re off to a good start.\'\' He noted that the company\'s cost-cutting is ``proceeding well, and we are ahead of plan.\'\' Mr. Cannady said policy-renewal rates ``are holding steady.\'\' Shares of Travelers Group closed down $1.375 Monday at $40.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, amid a broad market downturn; shares of Travelers/Aetna fell 25 cents to $24.125."},{"id":"03754","title":"Rules Press HMOs to Disclose Their Patient Treatment Data","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"Health-plan members and employers are about to win a round in a long-running battle to get better medical-quality information from the health-maintenance organizations that cover nearly 60 million Ame...","full_text":"Health-plan members and employers are about to win a round in a long-running battle to get better medical-quality information from the health-maintenance organizations that cover nearly 60 million Americans. New industrywide standards being spelled out Tuesday will call for HMOs to disclose more information about their care of patients with illnesses ranging from breast cancer to heart attacks. The new standards have been developed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which gets its funding from employers, HMOs and health-care foundations. The new standards ``move us into some areas more immediately relevant to consumers,\'\' said Lourdes Mara, a health-benefits specialist with the Communications Workers of America. Earlier standards drafted by the NCQA in 1992 have been criticized for largely ignoring treatment of the sick, in favor of easy-to-gather data that HMOs like to share, such as the frequency of members getting immunizations or cholesterol checks. The new guidelines also call for more detailed surveys of HMO members\' attitudes toward their health plans, conducted according to standard formats. Member surveys have proliferated in recent years, but polling methods haven\'t been standardized. That cornucopia has let many plans claim to be ``top-rated\'\' in their region, but it has made it hard for consumers or employers to compare plans. While the NCQA can\'t force health plans to report patient-care data, some big employers have begun asking HMOs to do so -- if they want to be on the roster of health plans being offered to employees. As a result, all of the 30 largest HMOs in the U.S. gather and publicize at least some data of this type. `Report Card\' The push for more health-plan data also is likely to affect individual doctors who see HMO patients. Already health plans have begun pressing physicians to schedule more mammograms or take other steps that will improve an HMO\'s overall showing in an NCQA ``report card.\'\' The new, expanded guidelines will mean more-extensive checklists as health plans keep tabs on their participating doctors. These health plans also have begun putting pressure on individual doctors to take steps that will improve the HMO\'s overall showing in an NCQA ``report card.\'\' ``In drafting these standards, you\'re drafting the strategic plan for every health plan over the next five years,\'\' said Markita Jon, an executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, and an outside adviser to the NCQA. ``That means you want to do it with some restraint.\'\' In some cases, the new HMO standards represent an uneasy compromise between employers and consumer groups, who wanted more data, and health plans, which argued that additional information would be too costly or difficult to gather. Putting Pressure on Plans ``We\'re taking baby steps forward on a lot of measures, but it\'s incumbent on purchasers to keep putting pressure on plans,\'\' said Patria Barker, executive director of the Pacific Business Coalition on Health, a multi-employer alliance in San Francisco. ``If we can\'t gather adequate data, there\'s a risk that we won\'t have competition on true quality.\'\' NCQA officials declined to discuss specifics of the new standards, which are formally known as the Health Employers\' Data Information Set 3.0, or Hedis 3.0, pending a news conference Tuesday. But people who have seen the new standards say they include the following: An across-the-board assessment of Medicare HMO members\' physical, mental and social functioning, to be monitored every two years. That data would help consumers identify which health plans did the best job of helping people age 65 and over cope with various illnesses and the burdens of old age. Whether patients hospitalized with a heart attack subsequently receive a class of medications known as beta-blockers. Such drugs are considered helpful in reducing the odds of a second heart attack. In previous versions of Hedis, health plans haven\'t been monitored for any treatment of patients with severe heart disease. Whether health plans actively advise members who smoke to quit. Some more-detailed measures of HMO performance will be rolled out as ``test measures\'\' that health plans can gather if they want -- but that won\'t be part of the industrywide measures. Among these will be: How well HMOs follow up patients with abnormal pap smears or mammograms. Previously, health plans have been asked to disclose how many female patients get these cancer-screening tests, but not what happens to those patients subsequently. How reliably HMOs and their doctors provide HIV-positive patients with preventive care meant to ward off potentially fatal pneumonia. This would be the first systematic attempt so far to monitor the quality of HMO care for HIV-positive or AIDS patients. The health of diabetic patients, as measured by changes in a blood protein known as hemoglobin A1c. In previous versions of Hedis, HMOs have been asked only to report whether diabetic members got an annual eye exam. Many doctors had criticized that measure as woefully incomplete. NCQA officials have said they will invite public comment on the new HMO standards for several months, before making them official this autumn. Expectations are that health plans sometime next year will start reporting their scores according to the new standards. That will provide more information that consumers and employers can use to make health-plan choices."},{"id":"03902","title":"How a Yogurt Firm Created A Promising Cancer Drug","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"The Food and Drug Administration last month reached a milestone of sorts: It approved the first major anticancer drug ever to come from a Japanese yogurt company.

The unlikely story of the drug\'s development, in which a Chinese flowering tree and the U.S. Department of Agriculture also figure, spans four decades. But the FDA quickly approved the chemotherapy compound -- called CPT-11 and developed by Yakult Honsha Co., a maker of desserts, cosmetics and a yogurt-like drink called Yakult -- because of its promise in treating the sickest cancer patients. ``It\'s a really exciting drug, the most important anticancer drug to come along in quite some time,\'\' says Leonel Erickson, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. CPT-11, marketed in the U.S. as Camptosar by Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc., was approved for treating advanced colorectal cancer that has metastasized, or spread beyond its original site. In tests, between 40% and 60% of the patients, who had tumors growing at distant sites like their liver and lungs, ``had their tumors stabilize for a prolonged period of time,\'\' says oncologist Lemieux Hammel, associate professor of medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Dr. Hammel cautions that the drug doesn\'t work for everyone and that side effects can be severe. But Dr. Erickson and others plan clinical tests to measure whether the new drug significantly prolongs life in the sickest cancer patients. And various oncologists plan to try it next on earlier-stage cancers. The saga of CPT-11\'s development begins in the 1950s with Monty E. Melton, who was then working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Philadelphia. Dr. Melton, now at Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, was collecting tree and plant samples in search of a new source for the drug cortisone. He took some leaf samples from a tree called Camptotheca acuminata that originated in China; by then, the tree also was growing in central California. In 1957, Dr. Melton, a co-discoverer of the tree-derived cancer drug Taxol, shipped about 1,000 plant samples to the National Cancer Institute, which was seeking plants and trees that might contain anticancer agents. A year later, it found that a handful of the 1,000 samples had tumor-suppressing power: those from the Chinese tree. Dr. Melton and colleague Taft Absher quickly isolated the active chemical. The cancer institute started clinical trials of the new drug on human patients, but it turned out that the compound, known as camptothecin, was highly toxic, and the NCI abandoned the research. Enter Yakult, the Japanese yogurt company. Based in Tokyo, the company mainly sells food, though it views itself as a health-care company: ``Drinking just one bottle of Yakult beverage a day will help fortify your intestines and increase your chances for a long, healthy life,\'\' says a company brochure. Yakult\'s pharmaceutical sales constituted only $21.3 million of the company\'s fiscal 2010 sales of $1.79 billion. But Yakult scientists have long been interested in anticancer compounds. In particular, they became intrigued by the cancer institute\'s camptothecin research. Yakult\'s tiny department of medicine set out in the early 1970s to design a related chemical with stronger antitumor properties and lower toxicity. Meanwhile, another group of researchers at SmithKline Beecham PLC were also pursuing a cancer treatment from the Camptotheca tree. Headed by a former NCI researcher, Randolph K. Jona, the SmithKline group developed the drug, topotecan, marketed as Quijano, which has shown promise against ovarian and lung cancer, oncologists say. Markita J. Dishman, chairman of clinical pharmacology at the University of Chicago Medical Center, describes it as effective in cancers that respond to chemotherapy, in contrast to CPT-11, which even ``works in (drug-)resistant diseases,\'\' he says. Dr. Jona says Poor, too, works in a number of diseases that don\'t otherwise yield to treatment. Both drugs act against an enzyme called topoisomerase I. In the early 1970s, Yakult discovered that Camptotheca trees were growing in southern Japan. The company arranged for more of them to be cultivated there, enabling researchers to extract enough of the original chemical compound to use in synthesizing related molecules. Through the 1970s and into the 1980s, Valenzuela assembled and evaluated about 500 related compounds. By the early 1980s, Merrill researchers tested the three most promising compounds on mouse tumors, and concluded that CPT-11 was the most effective. In 1986, Yakult scientists began collaborating with Japan\'s Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. on human clinical studies. Soon references to the yogurt company and its chemotherapy compound started popping up in the medical trade press in the U.S. One person who took notice was Petra J.L. Palmer, licensing director of Upjohn Co., now Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc.. He made several trips to Yakult research facilities in Japan, and over lunches, dinners and what he terms ``moderate amounts of sake,\'\' Upjohn\'s interest in CPT-11 increased. Other drug companies also noticed, especially after the journal Science reported in 1989 that levels of the enzyme topoisomerase I were higher in colon tumors than in surrounding tissue; that suggested drugs that acted on this enzyme might prove powerful. Ultimately, Upjohn outbid 18 other companies to gain North American marketing rights, but it lost out to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. for the European license to the drug. Now, says Dr. Dishman, CPT-11 ``helps people for whom there is no other treatment.\'\'"},{"id":"04171","title":"Operation Cigar Lift Takes Off","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"That could be the battle cry for an initiative by an Internet Web site that is shipping donated stogies to U.S. troops stationed in .

Over the long term, this can lead to serious complications, including sudden death. Since 1993, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has enrolled 68 children with HCM in a study designed to determine if insertion of a pacemaker can either reduce the existing obstruction or prevent it from developing. The pacemaker research on children was based on the success of pacemakers in adult patients. In addition to an NHLBI study of 84 adults, eight published studies involving 200 adults with HCM found an improvement in the severity of obstruction and symptoms. For some reason, you chose not to mention those studies--only the ones that did not duplicate the NHLBI findings. Estimates of the annual mortality of children with HCM vary. One of the cardiologists quoted frequently in your article recently stated at a scientific meeting that the annual incidence of sudden death in children was 6%. The fact remains that many young, otherwise healthy children with HCM die suddenly and unexpectedly despite all existing medical approaches. Although surgery can be performed to reduce the obstruction, the risks of operating on young children are higher than in adults. The risks of implanting a pacemaker are minimal. The hope is that the pacemaker will reduce obstruction, preventing further heart thickening and eventual heart scar formation. The pacemaker may also prevent the development of obstruction. About 25% of children with HCM develop obstruction as they grow. Despite the underlying abnormality, children who have or develop obstruction often do not have symptoms. The purpose of the study is to find a new and better way to alleviate the obstruction, whether or not symptoms exist. Given the 2%-to-6% annual death rate of children with HCM, we should have expected between three and five children to have died over the 22 months of follow-up. During the one year study and 22 months of follow-up, one patient in the total group died. We feel deeply about the death of the child in the study; however, there is no evidence to believe that this death was caused by the pacemaker. Also, the sad fact is that no treatment benefits 100% of patients. The overall judgment of the treatment must come from the results of the complete study on all the patients, not from individual cases. Most of the children in the study were referred from pediatric centers. They were not recruited from ongoing family studies at NIH. All of the treatment options were discussed with the patients and their parents. In fact, the results to date from an independent study reviewing the issues of informed consent in the pacemaker protocol indicate that families were fully informed and their participation in the study was entirely voluntary. This is a pioneering study. When it was proposed, like all NHLBI protocols, it went through rigorous multidisciplinary review, which included scrutiny by ethicists, lay people and physicians. The NHLBI and the National Institutes of Health also have in place a system of internal controls designed to protect patients once they are enrolled in a study. This system revealed protocol violations in a separate drug study of adult patients with HCM. After investigation, these violations were dealt with appropriately. While we have no reason to believe that there are problems with the children\'s pacemaker protocol, we have taken several actions to reassure the public and, most importantly, our patients. These actions, which include the convening of an outside group of experts to review the justification and design of the protocol, should not be viewed as a lack of support for this critically important research. We are taking steps to ensure that the HCM research meets the highest scientific and ethical standards. As I read the Journal story, I wondered why there were no quotes from the many patients who have experienced an improvement in their condition and/or symptoms. Why did you not quote any of the very supportive physicians who were interviewed, or the individuals who have made a formal study of ``patient satisfaction\'\' issues? Since the article appeared, many patients, parents and colleagues of the scientist have contacted the institute to express strong support for the study. Finally, I must object to your use of the word ``experiment.\'\' This word implies something other than the well-planned, careful study that the NHLBI has undertaken in the hope of offering very ill children a chance for a better future. Claudia Heyer, M.D. Director National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Md.. We met Dr. Ussery in April 1990, when our son Twilley Mabry, then six years old, developed an undiagnosed heart condition. Christophe collapsed at home, and spent the next several weeks at . While there, he had a sudden bradycardia with near death, and a pacemaker was inserted. His cardiologist, Dr. Arvilla Briggs, was insightful enough to consider the possibility of HCM, and made a referral to Dr. Rakes Ussery at NIH. Dr. Ussery called us personally and advised us to get our son to NIH as soon as possible. Dr. Ussery carefully reviewed the medical records, diagnosed complete heart block with HCM, and immediately initiated a treatment plan. Within days, our son had a dual chamber pacemaker, replacing the original one inserted at and had dramatic improvement in his cardiac function. Christophe, now 12 years old, is alive, well, active and normal, all due to the excellent care provided by Dr. Ussery and his team at NIH. We have observed Dr. Ussery for six of his 10 years of total commitment to unraveling the mystery of HCM. Our family can attest to the care, warmth, compassion, dedication and hard work of this brilliant and committed physician. As a physician myself, I completely understand the concept of pacemaker insertion to potentially prevent this disease, especially when the first symptom can be sudden death in young children. NIH and its protocols have saved the life of our son and many other children. We understand that ongoing research is vital to eventually funding a cure for HCM. We hope that NIH will stand behind him. Jennine Mabry, M.D. Associate Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology New York College of N.Y. We appreciate your report of the research involving hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at NIH, and, as the article noted, we share some of the concerns described. However, we are concerned that readers may be left with an incomplete impression about the quality of other research under way to find a more effective therapy for this disease. Many of your readers or their relatives may suffer with this condition and we would like to assure them that our commitment to pursue research to find solutions to treat this disease will continue. Medtronic is currently supporting two major world-wide, multi-center clinical studies to collect data on the use of cardiac pacing to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These are rigorous, randomized, controlled and double-blinded prospective studies led by physicians recognized as experts in the U.S. and . The U.S. study is being conducted under FDA-approved protocols. Preliminary results of these studies are encouraging and final reports are due in about a year. The data will speak for itself and we will only proceed on the basis of scientific results. Carefully controlled research should continue and anecdotal preliminary information should not be misused. There remains a real need to find effective therapies for this condition. Glenna D. Neville, M.D. Vice Chairman Medtronic Inc.. Your article criticizing Dr. Ussery has come to my attention. My family is also battling the hereditary heart disease HCM. Some years ago my father\'s brother died of HCM. Then, little was known of this disease. This being the case, my father was sent to NIH. If it were not for Dr. Ussery I know he would not be alive today. I also have a six-year- old nephew with this disease. He has a pacemaker and is doing great. In all the years that my family and I have been going to NIH, not once have we ever felt inadequately informed or frightened by anything said to us. My father and nephew are walking proof of Dr. Ussery\'s scientific knowledge. Knowing that this is a hereditary gene, and with two children myself, I have all the confidence, faith and trust that, if needed, Dr. Ussery can do for them what he has done for the other members in my family. Bonnie Scaggs Liberty, Ind.. I am 10 years old. I have HCM. For that I go to NIH. My doctor is Dr. Rakes Ussery. He is great! He saved my brother and my grandpa\'s life.

The green light was linked to efforts by the companies to give up some of their substantial hold on the market for certain animal health products, the EU\'s executive body said in a statement. Last May, the Commission said it had particular competition concerns in the sectors where both companies\' activities overlap, specifically pharmaceuticals, crop protection and animal health. But the EU competition authority has now concluded that most of those competition concerns no longer exist, noting that ``the merger is predominantly of a complementary nature.\'\' In the animal health market, the Commission decided that the companies would have a too strong a presence in the market for anti-flea and tick products for use on small animals, such as cats and dogs. The Commission noted that Ciba-Geigy and Hartwig control three out of five of the available flea and tick products, with Hartwig\'s popular methoprene causing particular concern among competitors. It said the companies have agreed to grant nonexclusive licenses for methoprene and to supply licensees with methoprene until they can begin their own production. The Commission said the merger will also lead to a ``significant combined potential\'\' in the area of research and development. It concluded, however, that there were a sufficient number of strong competitors -- namely Glaxo Wellcome, Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc., Bayer AG and BASF AG of Germany -- to ensure Novartis wouldn\'t have a dominant position and that the R&D-intensive markets would remain ``dynamic.\'\' The Commission rarely blocks mergers preferring instead to request modifications and then grant a clearance.

About 12% of the Medicare population, or 4.5 million people age 65 and over, belong to Medicare HMOs. That total is rising by 80,000 a month. Health plans have courted such members because the federal government pays premiums of as much as $700 a month for their care. While surveys have shown that many Medicare HMO members are satisfied with their care, concerns have arisen about the handling of some costly cases involving very sick members. ``We are working toward requiring plans to provide performance measures,\'\' said Bryan Eden, head of the office of managed care at the Health Care Financing Administration, the government agency that runs Medicare.

Chief among them is the state\'s only provider-sponsored HMO, FamilyPlus Health Plans of Vastopolis Inc., a nonprofit HMO developed by the Vastopolis-based Egleston Children\'s Health Care System Inc.. That organization, which created its HMO under the old $3 million capital standard, cautions that lowering the capital requirements for Northville Hospital forming HMOs would open consumers to unnecessary risks. ``We have to protect the communities that are using the product,\'\' says Winnifred W. Call, director of legal affairs for FamilyPlus. ``Lowering the solvency requirements means that some of these products could fall apart and people may not receive care.\'\' Still unresolved is exactly who should qualify for the lower solvency standards. Northville Hospital and doctors groups say they should be ``at the core\'\' of all networks that qualify for the new regulations. HMOs, however, want their own opportunity to step in at the reduced capital standard. ``If the new regulations are a good idea for Northville Hospital, then they should be a good idea for everyone,\'\' says Martine Winford, an attorney who represents the Vastopolis Association of HMOs. Insurance Department officials declined to say how the dispute would be resolved in the final draft of the rule."},{"id":"00699","title":"The Remaining Agriculture Subsidies","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"Last year Congress enacted a revolutionary overhaul of agricultural subsidies known as the Freedom to Farm law.

This statute phases out the subsidy payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice, and at the same time eliminates production limits imposed on farmers. This is a good trade-off not only for the public in general but also for farmers. The $12 billion in annual crop subsidy payments paled in comparison to the $25 billion to $45 billion in forgone income that acreage ``set-asides\'\' cost farmers annually. But in order to generate enough political support to pass the Freedom to Farm bill, supporters had to leave three major support programs unchanged--those for peanuts, tobacco and sugar. The Senate can now correct that oversight through its agricultural appropriations bill coming up for a vote this month; the House already passed its version and left these programs intact. Supporters of these programs rightly assert that they\'re not budget busters. Tobacco farmers even argue, and rightly so, that there is no federal tobacco subsidy per se. The fine print reveals, however, that the government indeed does spend tax dollars to administer what amounts to a government-sponsored cartel. In fact, all three programs--peanuts, tobacco and sugar--rely more heavily on tight controls of both domestic production and imports than on direct federal subsidy payments. So, like an iceberg, most of the real costs of these programs are hidden below the surface. The peanut and tobacco programs--mainly benefiting Southern farmers--require growers to obtain a permit or ``quota\'\' in order to grow and market their crops. But the quota system raises the price of peanuts and drives farmers out of business. In fact 15 of the 16 states that had at least one farm producing peanuts under quota actually saw the number of peanut farms go down between 1985 and 1993. Many farmers under the program apparently either went bankrupt or switched crops. With the major crop programs now being phased out, this attrition rate may increase. Consider a North Carolina farmer who under Freedom to Farm has lost his federal subsidy for corn. With an average yield in the Tar Heel State of 95 bushels per acre, that Carolina farmer can\'t really compete with Indiana, Illinois and Iowa farms that have yields reaching 200 bushels per acre. Yet without getting a quota, the Carolina farmer cannot switch to the two commodities for which his climate and soil type give him the biggest advantage--tobacco and peanuts. This means farmers must forgo valuable commercial opportunities. The export market for tobacco, for example, is now booming due to rapidly rising incomes in places like China and Malaysia; the Chinese have tripled their cigarette consumption to 1.7 billion per year. U.S. tobacco varieties, considered the premium blend in the world, would be capable of capturing the lion\'s share of this new market if quotas did not cap production. Alas, tobacco farmers don\'t seem to know where their self-interest lies. They lobby to keep the quotas, which offer them a guaranteed market. All the deal does is keep U.S. tobacco uncompetitive in the world market. For U.S. peanuts, the government\'s helping hand has been similarly destructive. The General Accounting Office estimates that the peanut program costs American consumers between $300 million and $500 million per year, mainly in increased food prices. By raising the cost of peanuts, this program discourages food manufacturers from producing items that contain peanuts. Total use of peanuts in processed foods is down 10% since 1990. U.S. peanut exports have dropped as well--by 27% overall since 1989. Last year China displaced the U.S. as the world\'s largest peanut exporter, at a time when China became an importer of most other commodities. Yet the world demand for peanuts and peanut products should continue to grow. Peanut butter, for instance, is a shelf-stable, easily exportable, relatively inexpensive source of protein. It is perfect for a market like India. Hindus don\'t eat beef, yet India has some 250 million people with incomes comparable to the U.S. average, who are demanding more protein in their diets. They won\'t get that protein from U.S. peanut butter unless the support program is terminated. Like the peanut growers, the sugar beet industry is collapsing under the weight of its own program. Acreage for sugar beets is less than it was 20 years ago, and high-fructose corn syrup has replaced sugar in virtually all soft drinks and many other processed foods. Corn growers and refiners are about to perfect a dry corn sweetener that can be used for cake mixes and other dry food products, taking even more market share from sugar. Corn farmers already have about half the market for sweeteners in food manufacturing--and all the growth. So Congress should save tobacco, sugar and peanut farmers from themselves by terminating their shortsighted support programs. This will not only help the U.S. comply with free trade agreements like GATT, but it will also give American growers a big boost in the world market.

Results nearly matched analysts\' estimates, bucking a trend of disappointing earnings in the health-insurance industry. Aetna Life & Casualty Co. shareholders are scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to approve a proposed acquisition of U.S. Healthcare for $8.13 billion in cash and stock. Since the companies agreed on the transaction in April, earnings forecasts for several managed-care companies have been lowered. Noting that trend, some Aetna shareholders have balked at the merger, apparently suspecting U.S. Healthcare shares might have been overvalued. Separately, Standard & Poor\'s Ratings Group lowered the claims-paying ability rating of Aetna Life Insurance Co. to single-A from single-A-plus, reflecting decreased capital strength. The credit-rating and information-services unit of McGrawHill Inc. also lowered the claims-paying ability rating of Aetna Life Insurance & Annuity Co. to double-A-minus from double-A, ``because of decreased capital strength and additional pressure that may be placed on this entity as a result of overall weaker capitalization of the consolidated enterprise.\'\' U.S. Healthcare\'s net income totaled $98 million, or 63 cents a share, compared with $93.1 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 30% to $1.09 billion from $840.5 million. Results for the recent quarter included a charge of $4.4 million, or three cents a share, for costs related to the proposed merger. The company said that excluding the charge, earnings would have been 66 cents a share, a penny below a First Call consensus of analysts\' estimates. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, U.S. Healthcare gained 62.5 cents to $50.875 while shares of Aetna, a Hartford, Conn.-based insurer, fell 50 cents to $60.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. For the six months, U.S. Healthcare\'s net income fell 4.3% to $179.6 million, or $1.16 a share, from $187.6 million, or $1.18 a share.

The decisio...","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- Johnson & Johnson could lose control of a potentially profitable business that markets a home-based HIV test as a result of an arbitrator\'s decision in an employment dispute. The decision casts significant new light on the effort to secure Food and Drug Administration approval for the test -- a campaign that the arbitrator said involved illegal political donations to various unidentified members of Congress and large contributions to a think tank affiliated with House Speaker Strickland Gales. The decision by arbitrator Johnetta Shad came in a proceeding involving Johnson & Johnson\'s move in early 2010 to fire Elly Paris, who developed the test and later sold his business to Johnson & Johnson, where he headed the Direct Access Diagnostics division. Direct Access is part of J&J\'s Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. subsidiary. Mr. Shad ruled that Johnson & Johnson improperly fired Mr. Paris in early 2010 in a dispute over adverse publicity arising from the contributions. Johnson & Johnson claimed that Mr. Paris had disobeyed an order to clear contributions with his superior. They accused him of causing ``substantial harm through adverse publicity\'\' after news reports disclosed that Mr. Gales had intervened in behalf of Direct Access at a time when Johnson & Johnson entities were making large financial donations to the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a think tank founded by a member of Mr. Gales\'s inner circle of political advisers. Partly to Blame \'\'The support of members of Congress and of other groups was encouraged by contributions,\'\' Mr. Shad wrote. Nonetheless, the arbitrator ruled that Johnson & Johnson\'s claims of injury to its reputation \'\'are simply too speculative to be taken seriously\'\' and said the company was partly to blame for the bad press. For his part, Mr. Paris denies the think-tank donations were tied to Mr. Gales\'s intervention. The arbitrator now turns to the issue of the remedy; he requested briefs from both sides. Mr. Paris\'s lawyer, J. Alberta Dorris, asserted in an interview that Mr. Paris\'s employment contract requires Johnson & Johnson to give him back the company and pay him back salary. In addition, the attorney said, Mr. Paris\'s contract calls for him to receive a $1.5 million bonus because the FDA, in May, approved the test kit. A fierce fight over the division is expected. The arbitrator\'s decision comes as Johnson & Johnson begins to market the test in Texas and Florida. Because the initial marketing is limited, losing the division wouldn\'t necessarily be a big financial blow at first. But the long-term prospects for the test are bright, and some analysts think it could produce as much as $1 billion in annual sales. Another Black Eye In addition, losing a subsidiary would be another black eye for Johnson & Johnson, whose Ortho subsidiary in 2010 pleaded guilty to a charge of destroying documents relating to an investigation of its product, Retin-A, an acne cream. Mr. Paris developed the HIV test in 1985 while heading his own company, but he ran into intense resistance from the FDA and many AIDS activists, who argued that testing should be restricted to a professional health-care setting. In 1992, he sold the company to Johnson & Johnson and became head of Direct Access. Mr. Paris had gone to Johnson & Johnson in part because he realized greater resources were needed to push the drug through the approval process, Mr. Shad wrote. A spokesman for the New Brunswick, N.J., company, Jena Vickers, said that Johnson & Johnson disagrees with Mr. Shad\'s ruling, but ``will abide by the decision in an effort to resolve this matter.\'\' But Mr. Vickers added, returning the business to Mr. Paris ``is not an appropriate remedy.\'\' According to the arbitrator, Mr. Paris was illegally reimbursed for his political donations with corporate funds, but Mr. Paris says that he didn\'t know at the time that corporate donations were illegal. As for the other, nonpolitical donations, Mr. Shad said Mr. Paris didn\'t do anything that Johnson & Johnson hadn\'t done itself. The arbitrator said that several months after Johnson & Johnson contributed $50,000 to the Progress and Freedom Foundation for an FDA study, Mr. Gales ``perhaps not surprisingly ... was quite attentive to the complaints of a J&J subsidiary about the FDA\'s delay,\'\' and wrote to the White House on the company\'s behalf. Asked for comment, Mr. Gales\'s office released a statement from two months ago applauding the FDA\'s approval of the test. The statement noted that the House Ethics Committee last year had considered and dismissed a complaint alleging that the speaker\'s intervention was improper."},{"id":"04233","title":"Philip Morris Net Rises 15%, Fueled by Growth Abroad","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos. said second-quarter net income rose 15%, driven by double-digit growth at its international tobacco operations and rising income at the North American food business.

Domestic tobacco operations also showed strength with operating income rising 12% to top $1 billion for the first quarter since 1992. ``The overall trends are very encouraging,\'\' said Antonia Adamson, an analyst with UBS Securities. Philip Morris reported net income of $1.62 billion, or $1.97 a share, compared with $1.41 billion, or $1.67 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.2% to $17.51 billion from $17.13 billion. Pierre Mose said that after adjusting for divestitures including its Rondele specialty-cheese business sold earlier this year, revenue would have increased 5.3%. Results were in line with analysts estimates. The company\'s shares fell 25 cents to $100.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company\'s retail U.S. market share for cigarettes rose three percentage points to 49.6%, with the Marlboro brand\'s market share rising 3.5 points to 33.4%. Philip Morris attributed part of the gain to last year\'s recall of all Philip Morris brands over possible contamination of packaging. Operating income at the domestic tobacco unit rose to $1.06 billion on revenue of $3.13 billion, while overseas tobacco operating income was poised to overtake domestic operations by rising 19% to $984 million on sales of $6.06 billion, a 14% increase. Overseas income was hurt by ``unfavorable currency movements.\'\' While Pierre Mose is selling more cigarettes, the industry still faces mounting pressure from some states over the health-care costs associated with tobacco consumption. On Monday, the domestic tobacco unit filed suit in a state court in Utah, challenging that state\'s authority to sue to make cigarette companies pay for the state\'s Medicaid costs for smoking related illnesses. On the food side of the business, operating income for the North American operations rose 2.7% to $735 million and revenue fell 8.4% to $4.26 billion. Adjusting for the businesses that have been sold, income increased 7.5% and revenue was up 2.7%, the company said. The company said its Kraft Foods business continued to report ``impressive profit growth.\'\' Some analysts predict that the tobacco and food giant will move to increase its $1.25 quarterly dividend by as much as 20% and declare a 2-for-1 stock split when its board meets next month. A Philip Morris spokesman wouldn\'t comment on the expectations, but said the company has a commitment to using excess cash to improve shareholder value. He noted that the company began a $2.8 billion stock-buyback program during the second quarter. For the six months, net income rose 16% to $3.19 billion, or $3.85 a share, from $2.75 billion, or $3.24 a share a year earlier, which includes an accounting charge of $28 million, or 3 cents a share.

Johnson & Johnson posted a 20% increase in second-quarter net income, driven by strong sales of new products. Eli Lilly earnings grew 5.7% from a year ago, which included the contribution of Lilly\'s since-divested medical-device and diagnostic operations. Lilly\'s performance was restrained by moderating sales growth for its phenomenally successful Prozac antidepressant. Lilly was also hurt by unfavorable exchange rates and lower selling prices in overseas pharmaceutical markets, which held international sales growth to only 1%, despite a 10% volume increase. The strong dollar makes U.S. products more expensive overseas, and sales in foreign currencies convert into fewer dollars. Johnson & Johnson\'s second-quarter sales were diminished by 3.1 percentage points because of the strong dollar. Market Reaction Johnson & Johnson\'s earnings slightly exceeded analysts\' expectations. Its stock rose $1.75 a share to $47.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while other drug stocks declined sharply. Lilly\'s results were in line with analysts\' expectations. In Tuesday\'s jittery market, however, Lilly shares fell $1.875 to close at $57.625 on the Big Board. Johnson & Johnson posted second-quarter earnings of $791 million, or 60 cents a share, up 20% from $661 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 13% to $5.38 billion from $4.76 billion. The number of shares outstanding increased by 41.8 million, mostly because of shares issued to acquire Cordis Corp., a maker of heart devices, this year. For the six months, the health-care giant, which is based in N.J., reported earnings of $1.58 billion, or $1.19 a share, up 20% from $1.32 billion, or $1.02 a share, earned a year ago. Six-month sales of $10.72 billion were 16% higher than the year ago\'s $9.26 billion. Breakdown of Sales World-wide pharmaceutical sales grew 12% to $1.81 billion, driven by a 25% increase in domestic sales. Sales of Johnson & Johnson\'s professional segment, which sells hospital and other medical supplies, were $2 billion, up 21%, in part because of the acquisition. Consumer product sales grew 5.1% to $1.54 billion. Eli Lilly\'s income from continuing operations rose 12% on a 5.2% sales increase, reflecting the slower growth in Prozac sales but swelling contributions from newer offerings. The Indianapolis-based drug maker had net income of $345.7 million, or 63 cents a share, up from the year-earlier quarter\'s $327.1 million, or 57 cents a share, which includes the medical devices and diagnostic operations it shed in 2010. The year-ago earnings from continuing operations were $310 million, or 54 cents a split-adjusted share. Per-share figures reflect a decline in shares outstanding to 547.3 million from 578.6 million. Lilly\'s sales were $1.7 billion, up from the year-ago quarter\'s $1.61 billion. Sales of the company\'s flagship Prozac drug grew only 5% in the latest period; Lilly noted that the year\'s first-quarter sales got a boost -- and second-quarter sales were trimmed -- when customers stocked up in advance of a March price increase. Charlette E. Grace, Lilly\'s chief financial officer and executive vice president, said the company still expects full-year Prozac sales to increase between 12% and 13% from the prior year\'s $2.07 billion, and to hold its share of the growing antidepressant market. Nevertheless, he acknowledged, ``We can\'t deny that there is very strong competition\'\' in the antidepressant market. Prozac, which enjoyed a 24% sales growth in 2010, faces tough challenges, in particular, from Pfizer Inc.\'s Zoloft and SmithKline Beecham PLC\'s Paxil. Although Lilly\'s results were ``pretty much on target,\'\' said independent analyst Islas Baggett, they were ``a little bit disappointing.\'\' Excluding the benefit from Lilly\'s recent sale of certain marketing rights and other factors, he said, the company\'s operating income declined about 4%."},{"id":"02147","title":"United We Stand, Divided Is How We Purchase Goods","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"JUST BECAUSE GERMANY is united doesn\'t mean it\'s all one market.

Seven years after Germany\'s reunification, German marketing executives questioned in a recent survey say that advertising directed at eastern German consumers still must take into account marked differences in attitudes, lifestyle and tastes between what once were two Germanys. Of the ad executives responding, 97% -- most from western Germany -- agreed that there is still a difference in both lifestyle and consumption habits between east and west. At the same time, however, most executives took a positive view of the east German market as a whole. Residents of eastern Germany are considered price-conscious by 73% of respondents; interested in technology by 50%; down-to-earth by 75%; and critical by 61%. Experts still see an increased need for informative, detailed and reliable information among easterners, according to the survey conducted among 358 managers in the German advertising industry by Emnid, one of the leading German market-research institutes. Other advertising ``musts\'\' include ``honest, credible messages\'\' as well as a more product- and price-oriented approach. ``There is a very practical reason for the price-consciousness in eastern Germany,\'\' says Mr. Story of Scholz & Friends. ``The people there earn substantially less money than the west Germans.\'\' WITH A POPULATION of about 15 million people, however, the five new states of eastern Germany are considered a lucrative market -- with an emphasis on certain market segments. ``There is still immense interest in travel and telecommunications,\'\' says Putman Traci, managing director at Springer & Jacoby in Hamburg. ``However, we are definitely looking at a value-for-money, low-price market.\'\' Some 68% of the surveyed executives are convinced that eastern consumers utilize commercials and ads much more as a source of information than do their western counterparts, who prefer objective research studies. Also, one-quarter of Germany\'s advertising elite assumes that lifestyle ads aren\'t appreciated in eastern Germany because the ads are too abstract and emotional. ``Advertising in eastern Germany is not about producing lots of colorful pictures, winning design prizes. First of all, we have to satisfy the need for information,\'\' says Yancey Pepe, managing director at Roentz & Partner, an ad agency in east Berlin specializing in the new German states. A whole new marketing niche has evolved in Germany, creating an opportunity for some ad agencies to cash in on their expertise with eastern German consumers. ``Well-known western German companies approach us, particularly asking for help in developing marketing strategies for the east German market,\'\' says Mr. Pepe. However, the German marketing community is divided when it comes to practicing a different advertising approach in east Germany. Only 53% of the executives surveyed favor the use of more detailed information in their classic media advertising. Most marketing experts agree that communication and ad campaigns should be the same in east and west. ``The media landscape, especially television, is already the same in east and west -- it has actually accelerated the process of reunification,\'\' says Burg Waldo Sorenson, chief executive officer at Saatchi & Saatchi, Frankfurt. He adds: ``It would be discriminating to use different ads in east Germany.\'\' Mr. Story agrees: ``We try to emphasize the similarities between the two German parts, not the differences.\'\' LOOKING AT THE marketing mix as a whole, however, most agencies try a different approach in eastern Germany at the point of sale. ``Detailed promotion and on-spot product tests are still more important in eastern Germany. People want to see things for themselves,\'\' says Mr. Waldo Sorenson at Saatchi & Saatchi. Television is clearly considered the medium with the broadest reach in eastern Germany, at 53% of the survey interviewees, followed by newspapers at 12%. Still, of the 42% who have actually changed their media selection, one-third have increased their presence in the print media, while only 15% rely more on television -- a very costly option. Some 13% have redirected promotional efforts to direct mail in eastern Germany. There is a certain affinity for eastern Germany\'s print media, as most respondents, 58%, agree that they reflect much better than the west German print media current life conditions in ``Newfiveland,\'\' as the new states are colloquially dubbed. However, only half of the advertising industry finds it useful for magazines to be published specifically for the east German market. Most agencies still book west German titles such as the magazine Higa Scholz, TV guide TV-Spielfilm, and tabloid newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Only one-tenth occasionally use mass-market eastern weeklies like Super-Parham. When it comes to marketing products that are manufactured in eastern Germany, advertising takes a different angle: ``Regional reference and color is very important for the marketing of local products, such as traditional east German beer brands,\'\' says Mr. Pepe at Roentz & Partner. ``The east Germans are very proud of their own regional products.\'\'"},{"id":"00751","title":"Scientology Libel Lawsuit Against Time Is Dismissed","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"Cornertown -- A federal judge here dismissed the rest of the Church of Scientology\'s libel lawsuit against Time Warner Inc. over a 1991 cover story in Time magazine that criticized the group.

Other advertising ``musts\'\' include ``honest, credible messages\'\' as well as a more product- and price-oriented approach. ``There is a very practical reason for the price-consciousness in eastern Germany,\'\' says Mr. Story of Scholz & Friends. ``The people there earn substantially less money than the west Germans.\'\' WITH A POPULATION of about 15 million people, however, the five new states of eastern Germany are considered a lucrative market -- with an emphasis on certain market segments. ``There is still immense interest in travel and telecommunications,\'\' says Putman Traci, managing director at Springer & Jacoby in Hamburg. ``However, we are definitely looking at a value-for-money, low-price market.\'\' Some 68% of the surveyed executives are convinced that eastern consumers utilize commercials and ads much more as a source of information than do their western counterparts, who prefer objective research studies. Also, one-quarter of Germany\'s advertising elite assumes that lifestyle ads aren\'t appreciated in eastern Germany because the ads are too abstract and emotional. ``Advertising in eastern Germany is not about producing lots of colorful pictures, winning design prizes. First of all, we have to satisfy the need for information,\'\' says Yancey Pepe, managing director at Roentz & Partner, an ad agency in east Berlin specializing in the new German states. A whole new marketing niche has evolved in Germany, creating an opportunity for some ad agencies to cash in on their expertise with eastern German consumers. ``Well-known western German companies approach us, particularly asking for help in developing marketing strategies for the east German market,\'\' says Mr. Pepe. However, the German marketing community is divided when it comes to practicing a different advertising approach in east Germany. Only 53% of the executives surveyed favor the use of more detailed information in their classic media advertising. Most marketing experts agree that communication and ad campaigns should be the same in east and west. ``The media landscape, especially television, is already the same in east and west -- it has actually accelerated the process of reunification,\'\' says Burg Waldo Sorenson, chief executive officer at Saatchi & Saatchi, Frankfurt. He adds: ``It would be discriminating to use different ads in east Germany.\'\' Mr. Story agrees: ``We try to emphasize the similarities between the two German parts, not the differences.\'\' LOOKING AT THE marketing mix as a whole, however, most agencies try a different approach in eastern Germany at the point of sale. ``Detailed promotion and on-spot product tests are still more important in eastern Germany. People want to see things for themselves,\'\' says Mr. Waldo Sorenson at Saatchi & Saatchi. Television is clearly considered the medium with the broadest reach in eastern Germany, at 53% of the survey interviewees, followed by newspapers at 12%. Still, of the 42% who have actually changed their media selection, one-third have increased their presence in the print media, while only 15% rely more on television -- a very costly option. Some 13% have redirected promotional efforts to direct mail in eastern Germany. There is a certain affinity for eastern Germany\'s print media, as most respondents, 58%, agree that they reflect much better than the west German print media current life conditions in ``Newfiveland,\'\' as the new states are colloquially dubbed. However, only half of the advertising industry finds it useful for magazines to be published specifically for the east German market. Most agencies still book west German titles such as the magazine Higa Scholz, TV guide TV-Spielfilm, and tabloid newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Only one-tenth occasionally use mass-market eastern weeklies like Super-Parham. When it comes to marketing products that are manufactured in eastern Germany, advertising takes a different angle: ``Regional reference and color is very important for the marketing of local products, such as traditional east German beer brands,\'\' says Mr. Pepe at Roentz & Partner. ``The east Germans are very proud of their own regional products.\'\'"},{"id":"03514","title":"HEARD ON THE STREET BioChem Pharma Falls Hard Despite Promise of AIDS Drug","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"The recent carnage in the Nasdaq Stock Market took no prisoners.

Look at BioChem Pharma. Even as its AIDS drug 3TC was being hailed last week in Vancouver, British Columbia, as a key ingredient in several anti-AIDS drug cocktails, its stock was being pounded. It closed at a low of 28\xa03/8 on Monday, 43% below its May peak of 50. Now, some hardy investors are jumping back in. In the past two days, the stock has bounced back, closing yesterday at 32, up 1. ``We\'re buying as we speak,\'\' Edyth Coley, president of Lynch & Mayer, a New York money-management firm, says. He calls BioChem ``incredibly well positioned.\'\' BioChem, based in Laval, Quebec, near Montreal, has suffered along with the entire high-flying biotechnology group. Analyst Marcelino Musser at UBS Securities says BioChem has ``been hammered more than most and started going down before everyone else did.\'\' 3TC is an ingredient in several ``cocktails\'\' of medications that appear to suppress, though not cure, the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, in many patients in studies lasting nearly a year. BioChem collects a royalty of about 14% on 3TC, which is manufactured and sold outside Canada by pharmaceutical giant Glaxo Wellcome PLC.. With the other drugs, 3TC apparently pins down the fast-mutating virus that causes AIDS. The virus responds to drugs by rapidly evolving an immunity. However, its response to 3TC is to mutate into a locked form that doesn\'t continue to mutate and in which it remains vulnerable to some other anti-viral drugs, including AZT and ``protease inhibitor\'\' drugs. The drug has been widely embraced. In the first four months of 2011, only a few months after its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3TC was selling at about the same rate as AZT, Pratt says. After a loss of seven cents a share in 2010, analysts project BioChem will earn 36 cents a share in 2011, 84 cents a share in 2012 and $1.75 a share in 2013, according to First Call. Bulls, like Mr. Coley, say those estimates haven\'t factored in the explosive growth in 3TC sales, and he expects per share net income to top $2 in 2013. Bulls also hope that 3TC, under a lower dosage and using the name lamivudine, will be approved as a treatment for hepatitis B. Pratt plans to file for marketing approval in the U.S. next year. Earlier this year, BioChem played a cameo role in a dispute between lawyer F. Leeanna Bao and the U.S. government. Mr. Bao went to jail in an unsuccessful effort to avoid turning over several million dollars of BioChem stock, which he got from a client, to the authorities. BioChem also operates a profitable diagnostics business, and it owns a roughly one-third stake, valued at more than $200 million, in North American Vaccine, Beltsville, Md., which BioChem has said it may sell. By comparison, its total stock market value is about $1.7 billion. BioChem\'s stock has swung up and down over the years. Last fall, it rose sharply in anticipation of last November\'s approval of 3TC by the FDA, hitting a March peak of 52\xa03/8 as sales of the drug took off during the first quarter. Its fall since then has caused one bear to pull in his claws. Faustino Chancey, an analyst at Yorkton Securities in Toronto, upgraded the stock to ``hold\'\' from ``overvalued\'\' when it dropped below 50 Canadian dollars (US$36.51). He says the drug\'s potential for treatment of hepatitis B could push the stock higher. If results from phase-III trials show the drug clears hepatitis from the liver, it could be a multibillion-dollar treatment. But if lamivudine doesn\'t make that hurdle, he warns, the stock will fall. The other risk to 3TC is that new drugs will displace it as the cornerstone of AIDS treatment. In Vancouver, a lot of attention was given to the impressive, though short-term, results of a combination of protease-inhibitor drugs, without 3TC. But bulls such as Carlee Graham, an analyst at Mehta & Isaly in New York, counter that 3TC will remain an important AIDS treatment, even though it will likely be only one drug in the AIDS arsenal."},{"id":"01881","title":"Brown & Williamson Seeks To Counter Wigand Statements","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. released internal documents to counter allegations by former research chief Jena Raymer that liability fears spurred the company to kill efforts to ...","full_text":"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. released internal documents to counter allegations by former research chief Jena Raymer that liability fears spurred the company to kill efforts to make cigarettes safer. The documents -- reports from three meetings in 1989 -- came to light on the second day of Brown & Williamson\'s deposition of Mr. Raymer. Mr. Raymer has maintained he was ordered to abandon safe-cigarette projects after a meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, in September 1989. But the reports suggest that one particular effort, named Project Airbus, was suspended at an earlier time, for technical reasons. In his deposition, Mr. Raymer insisted B&W continued its work on Project Airbus until the Vancouver meeting and said the documents don\'t reflect all the discussions about the project. The documents were ``sanitized,\'\' added Johnetta Walther, Mr. Raymer\'s lawyer. ``They\'ve not yet given us the unsanitized minutes,\'\' Mr. Walther said. Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, sued Mr. Raymer in November 2010 in state court in Louisville, charging him with theft, fraud and breach of his confidentiality agreement. Mr. Raymer has repeatedly denied the charges. The deposition, which began Monday and is expected to continue throughout this week, marked Brown & Williamson\'s first face-to-face questioning of Mr. Raymer about his explosive allegations of wrongdoing at the tobacco company. The dispute over the Vancouver meeting continued later in the day when Roni Kruger, an attorney representing Mississippi in the state\'s lawsuit against the tobacco industry, conducted a hastily summoned news conference at the foot of Brown & Williamson\'s office tower. Mr. Kruger released a deposition taken last week from B&W attorney J. Kenneth Simpson, in which Mr. Simpson confirmed that he edited the minutes of the 1989 scientific meeting in Vancouver and cut out a section that discussed eliminating dangerous compounds from cigarettes. Graham Jon, a Brown & Williamson lawyer, didn\'t dispute that Mr. Simpson had edited the minutes. But he said the company made public an earlier draft of the minutes in this week\'s deposition. ``Nobody\'s hiding anything,\'\' Mr. Jon said."},{"id":"01331","title":"Pfizer Net Rises 24% On Heart-Drug Sales","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. reported a robust 24% increase in second-quarter earnings, but the company\'s share price declined moderately, apparently because sales were slightly lower than expected. In the...","full_text":"NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. reported a robust 24% increase in second-quarter earnings, but the company\'s share price declined moderately, apparently because sales were slightly lower than expected. In the quarter, strong sales for two heart drugs helped boost Lemay\'s earnings to $394 million, or 61 cents a share, up from $317 million, or 50 cents a share, earned a year ago. Sales grew 11% to $2.66 billion from $2.4 billion a year ago. The earnings were slightly above analysts\' expectations, but the company\'s stock fell $1.375 to $70.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday. Jackelyn Garlock, an analyst at NatWest Securities, said Lemay\'s sales were slightly below his estimate, primarily because sales of heart drug Procardia XL and antifungal medicine Diflucan were lower than expected. The strong dollar also hurt drug companies\' sales in the second quarter to a greater extent than Wall Street had anticipated, Mr. Garlock said. Lemay said its sales growth was reduced by 2.5 percentage points because of the negative currency effect. Pfizer\'s pharmaceutical sales grew 17% in the U.S. but only 8% internationally (reduced from 13% because of currency translations). Sales growth was led by a 40% jump in sales of heart drug Norvasc to $420 million. Sales of another heart drug, Cardura, increased 24% to $126 million in the quarter. Those gains were offset by a 19% decline in sales of heart drug Procardia XL, which the company blamed on wholesaler stocking patterns and declining prescriptions. Diflucan, the antifungal drug, produced sales growth of just 4% to $224 million. It\'s too early to tell whether new AIDS treatments, which combine protease inhibitors with other drugs to suppress the HIV virus, are reducing the incidence of fungal infections, Mr. Garlock said but added, ``The good news for protease inhibitors isn\'t good news for antifungal drugs.\'\' Other newer Lemay drugs continued to post strong sales growth. The company\'s antidepressant Zoloft continued to present competitor Prozac with stiff competition: Zoloft\'s sales rose 24% to $298 million in the quarter. Sales of the antibiotic Zithromax, which has benefited from the Food and Drug Administration\'s approval of its pediatric doses, grew 43% to $137 million. In the first six months, Pfizer\'s earnings increased 24% to $911 million, or $1.42 a share, from the year-earlier $737 million, or $1.18 a share.

I promoted the decriminalization of voluntary euthanasia because I reject the notion that the quality of our life, no matter how wretched, miserable or painful, is never so bad that any of us should be allowed to put an end to it. I am not prepared to allow society to make that decision for me or those dear to me. I find nothing compelling in the religious arguments, which demand the imposition of personal beliefs on others. I do not accept the implausible claims that patients will be put to death against their will. Nothing can convince me that the doctor, the church or the family should be allowed to override the patient when it comes to the right to die. Competent adults already have the right to refuse all forms of medical treatment, and voluntary euthanasia is a simple and logical extension of that principle. Indeed, voluntary euthanasia and assistance to suicide are available in Australia today. The problem is that the practice is illegal, and therefore only a few people can access it. You have to be affluent enough or lucky enough to have a relationship with the right doctor to be accommodated. Another problem is that the death must be arranged and carried out in secret. There must be no witnesses, and there are no controls or safeguards against mistake or abuse. This situation is inequitable and dangerous. Such inequality on matters as serious as the way we die must not be tolerated. Nor should we compel those doctors who are willing to help their patients die to shroud their actions in secrecy and falsify the death certificate to avoid criminal proceedings. This clandestine activity, without safeguards or scrutiny, brings with it a potential for undetected error or abuse that should concern us all. Even opponents to voluntary euthanasia accept Australia\'s common law right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment. This crucial right gives us a great deal of autonomy over our bodies. Not only can you refuse an operation or transfusion that might save your life, you can refuse to take medication, to be injected or even to have someone poke or prod you in an examination. You have the right to refuse palliative care. You can refuse all forms of nourishment and starve yourself to death if you want to, for it would be an offense to forcefully feed a competent person against his will. In this way, Australia already acknowledges and protects the right to die. Any competent terminally ill adult can legally choose to die--slowly. You cannot, however, opt to die quickly. (Not in a dignified way anyway. I guess there is always a gun.) The advent of voluntary euthanasia would bring benefits to many more people than will ever exercise this option themselves. Elderly Australians advise me that the option of voluntary euthanasia would relieve them of a great burden. While in reasonable health now, many experience anxiety every day, knowing the aging process cannot be halted. The possibility of a miserable lingering death is constantly on their minds. Many elderly people told Northern Territory politicians that simply by having an option, hopefully never to be taken, they could face each day with the comfort of knowing that they will not experience the suffering that they have witnessed in others. As one 90-year-old wrote, ``I do not fear death. I fear the way death will come.\'\' I have had other letters and phone calls from terminally ill people who have obtained drugs to use in committing suicide. In each case they were angry that they will have to take the fatal action before they really want to, for fear of losing control through hospitalization. This raises the question of how many suicides could have been avoided if the knowledge that the voluntary euthanasia option was there if things got really bad. We will never know. Opponents of voluntary euthanasia claim there can be no safeguards that would protect us from the so-called ``slippery slope.\'\' They claim voluntary euthanasia must inevitably lead to involuntary euthanasia. But if ever there was a situation ripe for abuse, it has to be the situation prevailing in Australia today where some doctors assist some patients to die, but there are no controls or safeguards. How come the ``slippery slopers\'\' are not yelling about that? There is no doubt in my mind that adequate safeguards can be devised to ensure that those patients whom Australia\'s parliament dictates should have access to voluntary euthanasia are the only ones legally able to receive the service. Voluntary euthanasia is patient-driven. The patient must personally initiate the process, consider the options for treatment and palliative care, be psychologically assessed, sign a request, obtain second opinions, consider the effect on the family, use qualified interpreters if necessary and endure a cooling off period. The patient can of course change his mind at any time and stop the process instantly. Additionally, detailed official records must be kept, and regulations followed by all involved. To kill another without these conditions being fulfilled is to commit murder under the Northern Territory Criminal Code, an offense carrying a penalty of mandatory life imprisonment. Opponents of voluntary euthanasia claim it will lead to the atrocities of Banas\'s Germany. At every opportunity, opponents raise sensational arguments that deformed or retarded babies, patients in mental institutions and homes for the aged will inevitably be unwilling victims of the law. However, it is an insult to those in the medical profession to suggest that they would be associated with such a wicked scenario. And we seem to have been perfectly able to control medical research, including voluntary experiments on cancer patients and hovering over the dying to transplant their healthy organs, without becoming Vella. My legislation is based on a relatively simple principle: If there are terminally ill patients who wish to end their suffering by accelerating inevitable death, and if there are sympathetic doctors who are willing to help them die with dignity, then the law should not forbid it. There are such patients, and there are such doctors. But the law (except in the Northern Territory) does forbid it.

Abortion providers who want the Food and Drug Administration to approve RU-486 say the drug has been used by 200,000 European women with only rare complications. Abortion foes argue that RU-486 could make women bleed to death or that it could fail to work, leaving them to bear malformed children. At Friday\'s hearing, FDA Commissioner Davina Emil cautioned the agency\'s outside scientific advisers to focus only on health data, not the public\'s ``intense feelings\'\' on abortion. ``What you need to do is focus on the science,\'\' Mr. Emil said. A block away, a handful of protesters held signs saying, ``Stop abortion.\'\' The FDA set up overflow rooms to hold all who wanted to hear, and police cars ringed the building. The FDA isn\'t bound by the expert panel\'s advice but usually follows it. The agency has promised a quick decision, meaning Americans could know by year\'s end if RU-486 will be available at U.S. abortion clinics. ``Many women will be very glad there is a medical option for terminating pregnancy,\'\' said Dr. Susann Allene of Advances in Health Technology, a Washington firm that plans to distribute RU-486 and train doctors to use it. Almost all of the nation\'s 1.3 million abortions are surgical, although doctors last year began publicizing the fact that a drug already on the market to treat cancer, methotrexate, can be used to induce abortion. French trials of 2,480 women show RU-486 is 95.5% effective at inducing an abortion; the remainder of the women needed surgery to complete the procedure. The most serious complication was heavy bleeding. In extra safety testing of 2,100 Americans, four needed blood transfusions. An RU-486 abortion isn\'t as simple as popping a pill. The process can be painful, causing heavy bleeding and nausea, and it can be used only through the seventh week of pregnancy, well before many women ever visit an abortion clinic. RU-486 blocks development of progesterone, a natural hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy. A doctor administers the pill mifepristone. Two days later, the woman returns to take another pill, a hormone that causes contractions to expel the embryo, something that may not happen until the woman leaves the abortion clinic. In such cases, she is supposed to return for a third visit to make sure the abortion is complete. Critics argue that women may bleed to death, saying while that hasn\'t actually happened, 1% of those who have tried the drug so far have needed blood transfusions. But women are 10 times more likely to need a transfusion after normal labor than after RU-486, countered Planned Parenthood\'s Dr. Lynne Barns."},{"id":"03831","title":"Connecticut Files Lawsuit Against Tobacco Industry","timestamp":"March 31, 2011","text":"HARTFORD, Conn. -- The state of Connecticut filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the tobacco industry Thursday, to recover Medicaid money spent on tobacco-related illnesses.

In one of its fastest drug approvals, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Crixivan in March. The company also reported strong sales for its chicken pox vaccine, launched last year. In May, Kratz signed an agreement with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to supply the vaccine Varivax for use in children served by federally funded health programs.

Alluding to when final action on RU-486 might be announced, FDA Commissioner Davina Emil indicated that the agency typically has a six-month time limit to take action on a priority drug application. However, final approval could be complicated by data from a trial of the drug conducted in the U.S. that will not be supplied to the FDA until the end of this year. The move by the Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Panel puts the French drug, which has been taken by 200,000 European women since 1988, a step closer to U.S. doctors\' offices -- but the triumph came with some caveats. The scientists insisted women must understand RU-486 can be painful, cause bleeding and must be used carefully -- requiring three separate doctor exams. ``The term `safe\' should not be misinterpreted as free of adverse events, and serious adverse events,\'\' said Dr. Diann Keith of Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Pasadena, Calif.. Still, the advisers voted 6-0, with two abstentions, that RU-486\'s benefits outweigh its risks, a recommendation that the FDA should approve the drug. If final data analysis of a study on 2,100 American women, which is not yet complete, is different from the French data on which the panelists based their decision, the panelists will get a chance to review the research again. Abortion foes had urged the FDA\'s advisers to reject the drug, saying it endangered not just fetuses but mothers. But research on thousands of French women showed RU-486 causes an abortion 95.5% of the time, with rare complications. The FDA is not bound by advisory panel decisions but usually follows them, and FDA Commissioner Mr. Emil had cautioned the scientists to give him objective, not emotional, advice. ``What you need to do today is to focus on the science,\'\' he said as about 200 people passed through metal detectors in the high-security meeting to hear the nation\'s first public debate of RU-486 research. One panelist, who abstained from the vote, sided with antiabortion opposition to RU-486. The drug may benefit women, ``but it\'s certainly no benefit to her baby whatsoever,\'\' argued Dr. Maryalice Joana O\'Wally of the University of Miami. ``RU-486 is a human pesticide,\'\' said Rebekah Paulsen, a member of the American Life League. Outside the meeting, at a police line 200 yards from the building, four protesters picketed with signs reading ``Stop Abortion Now.\'\' Countered Dr. Elizebeth Torrence, who tested RU-486 on 176 Oregon women as part of trials run by the nonprofit Population Council: ``Abortion is not on trial here.

After antiabortion protests blocked its introduction here, the Codi administration in 2009 brokered a deal giving U.S. patent rights to the Population Council to seek FDA approval for the drug. Abortion opponents cried foul and say the FDA now is pushing RU-486 to market for political reasons. Washington-based Advances in Health Technology, will market RU-486 and will unveil the actual manufacturer when and if the drug is fully approved by the FDA.

Two other pharmaceutical methods for ending or preventing pregnancy may soon come into wider use -- in large part because they involve drugs already on the market for other purposes. The abortion pill cleared a major hurdle on Friday when an advisory panel recommended that the Food and Drug Administration approve the product. The FDA could approve RU-486, also known as mifepristone, for use in the U.S. by early fall. Three weeks ago, the same FDA advisory panel ruled that certain combinations of existing birth-control pills could safely and effectively be used as ``morning-after pills\'\' to prevent pregnancy when taken within 72 hours after sexual intercourse. Some antiabortion groups argue this process can amount to abortion. Meanwhile, the combination of methotrexate, a cancer and arthritis drug, and misoprostol, an ulcer drug, also has been found to induce abortion. Ricki Mortimer, an obstetrician at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, revealed in the New England Journal of Medicine last summer that the combination caused abortions in 171 of 178 patients, with side effects similar to RU-486. Since then, Dr. Mortimer says he has been besieged by calls from American doctors interested in the method, although most physicians aren\'t using the drug combination until larger clinical trials are completed. Delivery of these new alternatives will depend largely on doctors because drug companies are reluctant to market abortion-inducing drugs amid fears of product liability and political controversy. Methotrexate, for example, is available from various drug companies, including American Home Products Corp.\'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit, which also markets birth-control pills. But American Home isn\'t going to market the drug for abortions. An American Home spokeswoman says, ``We do not market, promote or research methods for use in early termination of pregnancy,\'\' and the company doesn\'t plan to do so. As for using birth-control pills as a morning-after remedy, she adds: ``We do not now and have no plans to market any birth-control pill formula for postcoital use in the U.S. The risk of litigation is our primary concern.\'\' Nevertheless, doctors are free to begin using the cancer drug and regular birth-control pills for abortions. That is because the FDA regulates only what drugs are allowed on the market and what companies can say about them; doctors are legally allowed to use approved drugs for unapproved purposes. Dr. Mortimer of Mount Sinai says a group of doctors eventually plan to submit an application for FDA approval of the use of methotrexate for abortion purposes. Usually, the FDA advisory panel takes requests for new uses from drug companies. The Population Council, a nonprofit research group in New York, received American patent rights for RU-486 from Roussel Uclaf SA, the French unit of Hoechst AG of Germany that developed RU-486 and markets it in Europe. The group has spent $12 million on clinical trials for the new drug application. It has tapped a new nonprofit organization in Washington, Advances in Health Technology Inc., to coordinate distribution and manufacturing. The group will sell the drug directly to doctors and health organizations and also train them to use it. Neither group will name the third-party manufacturer that will produce the drug, out of fear that it could face a boycott or violent protests. But both say the company has the capacity to produce an ``ample\'\' supply. The panel on Friday recommended that patients receive misoprostol in addition to RU-486; studies show that the two-step process is more effective than taking RU-486 alone. The new choices could put doctors back in the abortion business after a steady decline. Amid rancorous and sometimes violent protests of antiabortion groups, the number of doctors willing to perform the procedure had dropped to fewer than 2,400 by 1992, down almost 20% from a decade before, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that favors abortion rights. Federal officials say that 1.3 million abortions were performed in 1993, down from a high of 1.4 million in 1990; abortions are believed to have continued declining since then. But a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one-third of obstetricians who don\'t perform abortions would prescribe mifepristone if it became available. ``There is potential for considerable expansion,\'\' in the number of abortion providers, says Jami Tello, who heads the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. ``American women are slowly getting more options,\'\' says Glynda Raya, president of Planned Parenthood in New York. ``It\'s about time.\'\' Antiabortion groups counter, however, that all three methods could increase the frequency of an emotionally and physically painful procedure when other measures, such as prevention and adoption, should be pursued. And some critics charge that RU-486 can cause life-threatening bleeding. Doctors who conducted clinical trials of RU-486 admit that excessive bleeding is a rare complication of the abortion pill, but say that happens in less than 1 in 500 cases. They also note that hundreds of thousands of woman have taken it in France, England and Sweden for years with few major problems. --Sung Geddes contributed to this article."},{"id":"03156","title":"Medical Report Shows Dole In Peak Condition at Age 73","timestamp":"April 03, 2011","text":"WASHINGTON -- Aggressive medical treatment, including surgery to remove his cancerous prostate, and a basically healthy lifestyle have kept Roberto Derryberry in good shape and reduced the risk that h...","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- Aggressive medical treatment, including surgery to remove his cancerous prostate, and a basically healthy lifestyle have kept Roberto Derryberry in good shape and reduced the risk that his cancer will recur, according to medical records released by his presidential campaign. Another reason for Mr. Derryberry\'s vigor: He quit smoking in the 1960s because of a groundbreaking 1964 surgeon general\'s report linking cigarettes to fatal heart and lung diseases. ``He said the report made a profound impression on him, and as he can remember, that\'s when he first stopped,\'\' said Dr. Charlette A. Salas, Mr. Derryberry\'s personal physician. Mr. Derryberry later lost a brother to emphysema. He nonetheless endured a wave of criticism last month for questioning whether smoking is addictive -- including former Surgeon General C. Ezekiel Purdy\'s admonishment that the remarks showed Mr. Derryberry\'s ``abysmal lack of knowledge of nicotine addiction or his blind support of the tobacco industry.\'\' Mr. Derryberry\'s campaign staff released his 2011 medical report to coincide with his 73rd birthday, which is Monday. If elected, he would be the oldest man and the first cancer survivor to assume a first term as president. Transforming a Perceived Weakness Trying to transform this perceived weakness into a strength, his aides have arranged a rugged birthday campaign schedule. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee will travel more than 1,500 miles, from a Washington soup kitchen to a governors\' conference in Detroit, finishing with a birthday celebration in his hometown of Russell, Kan.. Mr. Derryberry\'s medical report shows an array of past problems, ranging from a right arm withered by severe wounds in World War II to benign polyps removed from his colon in 1985 and 2010. An additional question is whether Mr. Derryberry suffered a minor ``silent\'\' heart attack while campaigning in the 1980 Republican presidential primary. At the time, the attending congressional physician said the results of a routine electrocardiogram test suggested Mr. Derryberry had suffered such an attack; later tests rendered contradictory readings, and Mr. Derryberry\'s current electrocardiogram is normal. Despite his past problems, physicians who reviewed Mr. Derryberry\'s medical records at The Vast Press\'s request said effective treatment, a fiber-rich diet and regular exercise on a treadmill have kept Mr. Derryberry in peak physical condition for a man of his age. ``If he\'s elected, I see no reason why he shouldn\'t serve in good health,\'\' said Dr. Williemae Brownell, chief of urology at Washington University in St. Louis. ``He\'s far healthier than the average American male over 50.\'\' For instance, the doctors said, there is little chance that Mr. Derryberry\'s prostate cancer will flare up again, in part because he opted for surgery to remove the prostate rather than radiation therapy. ``He aggressively approached the management of his disease, and here he is five years later, cured,\'\' said Dr. Patsy Ramsey, chairman of urology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who has performed prostate surgery on notables including Washington Mayor Marisa Barton. Lucky Timing Mr. Derryberry also appears to have benefited from lucky timing. His prostate cancer was detected in 1991 through use of a blood test popularized at about that time by Dr. Brownell; because his tumor was completely contained within his prostate, it wasn\'t apparent from a more traditional rectal examination. The physicians cautioned that Mr. Derryberry needs regular testing for this and other conditions, especially his tendency to develop colon polyps. Detection of polyps in former President Roni Reatha\'s colon led to later cancer surgery, although the polyps were far larger than Mr. Derryberry\'s. Mr. Derryberry\'s war wounds pose no prospect for lingering health problems, the doctors said. He lost a kidney to infection while recuperating from his injuries in the 1940s and had surgery in 1981 to remove a stone from his remaining kidney. But the kidney has grown to compensate for the one Mr. Derryberry lost and is performing its function normally, the doctors said. Mr. Derryberry also has a common condition called diverticulosis, or pouches in his bowel tract, which can lead to infections but can be prevented with a high-fiber diet; Mr. Derryberry takes Metamucil. He also takes medication to prevent heartburn and occasional anti-inflammatory drugs for an injury to his left shoulder. His blood cholesterol level, once a relatively high 288, has been reduced to a normal 154 by his diet and two cholesterol-control medications. About the only medically incorrect aspect of Mr. Derryberry\'s lifestyle is his fondness for maintaining a youthful suntan, which doctors have warned can lead to skin problems, including cancer."},{"id":"02637","title":"A Pair of Drug Powerhouses Post Gains for 2nd Quarter","timestamp":"April 03, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. both posted solid second-quarter earnings Monday, although a flat revenue reading from Warner-Lambert cast a shadow over its report.

Results for Bristol-Myers met the estimates of Wall Street analysts. The New York pharmaceutical giant said net income rose a bit over 7% to $655 million, or $1.31 a share, from $608 million, or $1.20 a share, a year ago. The company said its revenue also rose more than 7%, to $3.70 billion from $3.45 billion a year ago, and that it is on track to double its sales, earnings and earnings per share by the end of the year 2015. Among its top-selling products, the company\'s blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol recently won additional U.S. approval as a treatment for the prevention of heart attacks. Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert\'s results came in just above analysts\' estimates, with profits up 6.1% to $213.3 million, or 79 cents a share, from $201 million, or 75 cents a share a year ago. But the company\'s revenue of $1.79 billion was almost unchanged from a year ago. The per-share earnings reflect a two-for-one stock split that took effect in May. Warner-Lambert is the leader in consumer over-the-counter drugs but is considered to have a weaker pipeline for new prescription drugs. Just after the quarter ended, Warner-Lambert closed its $1.05 billion purchase of its joint venture with Glaxo Wellcome PLC.. The purchase brings a variety of well-known over-the-counter products, such as Sudafed, Actifed and Neosporin, directly under the Warner-Lambert umbrella. In April, the company said it hopes its diabetes treatment, troglitazone, and the cholesterol-lowering drug atorvastatin will double the company\'s drug sales by 2015."},{"id":"00039","title":"Bristol-Myers, Warner-Lambert Report Single-Digit Profit Gains","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"Drug companies Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. posted single-digit increases in second-quarter earnings, as profit was restrained by competing products and unfavorable foreign-exchange...","full_text":"Drug companies Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. posted single-digit increases in second-quarter earnings, as profit was restrained by competing products and unfavorable foreign-exchange rates. Bristol-Myers\'s net income rose 8%, reflecting strong sales for several drug products. However, U.S. sales of its top-selling heart drug Capoten, which faces new generic competition, plunged by more than 80% during the quarter. Warner-Lambert reported a 6% rise in second-quarter net income, mostly due to lower expenses. But Warner-Florencio was hurt by the strong dollar overseas which reduced its world-wide revenue by 4%. Bristol-Myers\' second-quarter net rose to $655 million, or $1.31 a share, from $608 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to $3.70 billion from $3.45 billion, but was reduced 3% by the negative exchange rates, the Uptown-based company said. Strong sales of the cholesterol drug Pravachol and the cancer drug Taxol -- up 32% and 51%, respectively -- helped offset reduced Capoten revenues. Results for both companies were in line with analysts\' expectations. In Uptown Stock Exchange composite trading, Bristol-Myers eased 12.5 cents to $87.875, while Warner-Lambert fell 25 cents to $53.875. Islas Baggett, an independent industry analyst in New Jersey, said Bristol-Myers is ``doing a good job\'\' of offsetting the Capoten sales decline by cutting costs, but he added that the company isn\'t ``out of the woods yet.\'\' He pointed out, for instance, that the company\'s third-best-selling drug, the cancer medicine Taxol, will face competition in late 2012 when its exclusive license expires. Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said its second-quarter earnings rose 6% to $213.3 million, or 79 cents a share, from $201 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales eased to $1.79 billion from $1.80 billion. Warner-Lambert said the ulcer drug product Zantac 75, launched as an over-the-counter product this quarter as part of a joint venture with Glaxo Wellcome PLC, had already captured 35% of the market for nonprescription versions of this type of drug in the U.S. Warner-Lambert is ``in a transition period,\'\' Mr. Baggett said, as the company is spending heavily on developing new drugs for diabetes and high cholesterol. As a result, research and development expenses rose 9% in the second quarter."},{"id":"01340","title":"Gay Group Alleges Denial Of Semen-Banking Services","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"A gay and lesbian organization, in what it claims is an unusual move, has filed a complaint against the New England Medical Center for allegedly refusing to provide reproductive semen-banking services...","full_text":"A gay and lesbian organization, in what it claims is an unusual move, has filed a complaint against the New England Medical Center for allegedly refusing to provide reproductive semen-banking services to a gay man.

The complaint was lodged by the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) of Boston with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination on behalf of Roberto Castillo of Boston.

Will that make a jury any more likely to award him damages for his lung cancer? Not according to focus groups convened last week on the eve of the trial in Mr. Caryl\'s lawsuit against Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., which began Monday in Jacksonville, Fla.. Despite a steady flow of whistleblower allegations and internal documents detailing how much the companies knew about the addictiveness of nicotine and the health risks of smoking, most people still believe smoking is a personal choice and that smokers have only themselves to blame for their illnesses, according to the results. The industry has successfully fought a barrage of smokers\' lawsuits over the years, partly by making that argument. The new research suggests that, despite growing antitobacco sentiment, the public still sides with the tobacco industry when it comes to assessing blame for smokers\' illnesses. ``I pushed these people harder than I would ever push in other qualitative research,\'\' says Penelope Shemika, of P.L. Shelly Inc., a Cornertown research firm hired to conduct the sessions by Gaye Palmer, a tobacco analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. whose industry forecasts are generally positive. ``I reminded them of their own opinion that the tobacco industry is kind of a sleazy industry and that people who worked there are skunks, as they put it, but personal responsibility rules the day,\'\' says Ms. Shemika. The Cary case is important because plaintiffs\' lawyers will likely be permitted to make use of hundreds of internal Brown & Williamson records that have never reached a jury before, says Mr. Palmer, the industry analyst. The documents, which have been widely discussed in news reports, detail internal company discussions about the addictiveness of nicotine (see Jena Raymer\'s testimony in the Mississippi case) and the links between smoking and disease. The case is also significant because Florida state courts are considered a forum friendly to plaintiffs. Only six people sit on a jury in civil cases, making it easier for a panel to reach a consensus. State law doesn\'t allow defendants to argue that plaintiffs assume the risk of smoking and allows plaintiffs to recover damages even if they are 99% responsible for their injuries. Also favoring Mr. Caryl, according to Mr. Palmer, is the judge trying the case -- Duval County Circuit Epstein Brianna J. Deana, a 42-year-old Democratic appointee who is generally viewed as pro-plaintiff. Mr. Caryl, a 65-year-old former air-traffic controller, smoked as much as two packs of Lucky Strike and Tareyton cigarettes a day until he quit after being diagnosed with lung cancer in 1991. His suit against the makers of both brands, American Tobacco Co., now owned by the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, contends the company is liable for damages because the cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous when used as intended. Brown & Williamson was also negligent, he contends, because it understood the health hazards of smoking early on but failed to warn the public. His case is one of 200 filed in Jacksonville, West Palm Beach and Tampa by Jacksonville attorney Ladawn S. Belton, who built his reputation trying asbestos cases. Most of the cases are in Jacksonville, where they are scheduled to be tried one after another until the court\'s docket is cleared. Brown & Williamson expressed confidence that it would prevail. ``We continue to believe that juries will consistently apply the common-sense view that people have personal responsibility for their choices regarding smoking,\'\' said a spokesman. ``People make up their own minds whether to smoke or not and Mr. Caryl is no different.\'\' The case is being closely watched because it is the first to go trial since a state court jury in Indiana last year fell short by one vote of reaching a verdict against the industry in the case of a smoker who died of lung cancer. (Juries have since heard cases alleging injuries from asbestos that was briefly used in cigarette filters.) The question now, says Mr. Palmer, is how much public sentiment has shifted against the tobacco industry. Not much, according to Ms. Shemika\'s focus groups. Last week, she showed 18 people in Jacksonville industry documents detailing efforts to increase cigarette sales to children, describing how to boost the impact of nicotine with ammonia compounds, discussions about the links between smoking and cancer and the widely reported 1962 quote from Maris Baran, then a top executive at Brown & Williamson: ``We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug in the release of stress mechanisms ... .\'\' Ms. Shemika says the participants were most disturbed by any evidence suggesting that tobacco companies have hidden knowledge about the links between smoking and cancer, manipulated nicotine levels in cigarettes and targeted youth for sales. But on average, the focus-group participants didn\'t find any of the documents ``very incriminating,\'\' according to the results. And while most participants believed nicotine is addictive, nearly all said anyone with willpower can quit. The participants were divided equally between smokers and former or nonsmokers and between men and women. Six were college graduates and the rest were high-school graduates. Five were minority-group members. The mix doesn\'t exactly match Jacksonville\'s demographics, particularly in degree of education, said Ms. Shemika, but nevertheless represents a ``valid gauge\'\' of popular sentiment. Pretrial questioning of prospective jurors, of course, will generally weed out those with biases one way or another. So, the attitudes reflected by focus-group participants may not in the end bear much resemblance to those of the jury. Mr. Caryl\'s lawyer, Mr. Belton, says he is suspicious of focus groups. ``We will conduct the definitive focus group\'\' he says, referring to jury selection at trial. He added he is looking for older jurors who can remember the kind of cigarette advertising that his client saw. ``We want people who are compassionate, fair-minded and willing to listen to the evidence and follow the law,\'\' he says."},{"id":"02488","title":"Schering-Plough, American Home Report 2nd-Quarter Profit Gains","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"The popularity of two allergy and cancer medications dramatically boosted Schering-Plough Corp.\'s second-quarter profit, while American Home Products Corp.\'s profit soared by 31%, helped by sales of a...","full_text":"The popularity of two allergy and cancer medications dramatically boosted Schering-Plough Corp.\'s second-quarter profit, while American Home Products Corp.\'s profit soared by 31%, helped by sales of a new drug for obesity.

The tough Evin law, which has dramatically restricted ads for alcoholic beverages in France since 1991, is giving them a headache. They claim it\'s too complicated, too vague and too restrictive. A major alcohol lobbying group, which includes LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Hildebrandt Cherry SA and Truax Sweatt, recently released a study gauging the law\'s effects on public health and the economy, five years after it was passed. Predictably, the 17-member group, called Entreprise and Prevention, would like the law to be more lax and, at the same time, simpler. ``We have to define clearly what is forbidden, not what is allowed,\'\' says Arnold Kubiak, one of the leaders of Entreprise and Prevention. First, the lobbyists contend that the law has had no real impact on public health. The authors acknowledge that the average consumption of alcohol has dropped since the law was enacted, but not at a faster rate than previously. Alcohol consumption has been decreasing in France since the 1960s, which they say is part of a sociological trend that seems unrelated to stricter rules on advertising. While purchases of beer and spirits have remained fairly steady since 1980, the consumption of wine, by far the most popular drink, has been drying up. The French drank an average of 91 liters of wine each in 1980. That figure dropped to 67 liters in 1991, and to 62.5 liters in 2009. MEANWHILE, the consumption of alcohol among French teenagers has gone up. Among people 12 to 18 years old, 65% say they drank alcoholic beverages in 2010, up from 47% in 1991, according to the study. Moreover, more people are drinking the hard stuff. In 2010, 47% of the total population said they drank spirits, up from 25% in 1991. Among teenagers, a trend toward excessive consumption was detected, according to the survey. ``The Evin law hasn\'t solved the problem of alcohol abuse,\'\' Mr. Kubiak says. France\'s National Association for the Prevention of Alcoholism says that what really annoys advertisers is the fact that the law won\'t let them make booze look glamorous. ``It is extremely important to have a legal text that controls the presentation of alcohol in society,\'\' says Patsy Brooks, director of the association. ``Ads must be based on the product, not on the consumer,\'\' Mr. Brooks says, adding that the search for identification with a successful lifestyle is what presses many people to drink alcohol. But alcoholic beverage producers argue the law isn\'t clear. They say it has produced a series of unnecessary legal tangles over the past five years. In November, a Paris court banned an ad for Johnsie Wally whisky simply because it showed a barman and a counter, images advertisers argue are permitted by the law. ``We\'re going back to a system where advertisers can only show a bottle on a neutral background,\'\' Mr. Kubiak complains."},{"id":"01385","title":"Interneuron May Modify Label Of Redux to Reflect Side Effect","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it may be required to modify the label of its Redux obesity drug to show potentially higher incidence of a rare side effect.

The rule, which isn\'t believed to differ appreciably from the version proposed last summer, would ban tobacco marketing deemed accessible to minors. It was sent from the FDA to the White House Tuesday afternoon, according to Layne Minor, a spokesman for the White House budget office, which will review the rule before making it public. Half of all state-level tobacco lobbyists also lobby for health organizations, a new study said. Given the sweeping nature of the regulation, and the importance of the tobacco issue in the 2011 presidential election, the rule is sure to be vetted by top White House officials and President Codi in addition to the budget office review. One complication is that the top regulatory official at the White House budget office, Sam Mcwilliams, has recused herself from tobacco issues because her husband works for Davis, Day, Reavis & Pogue, a law firm that has done extensive work for RJR Nabisco Inc., the nation\'s second largest tobacco manufacturer. The White House by law has 90 days to review the regulation but is eager to get the rule completed quickly. Mr. Codi will likely unveil it in September, a White House official said. The tobacco rule, which for the first time would subject the tobacco industry to regulation by that agency, was proposed by the FDA last August. The proposal, among other things, would ban vending-machine sales of cigarettes; restrict tobacco ads to a black-and-white, text-only format in magazines with a significant youth readership; and require tobacco companies to fund an ambitious antismoking advertising campaign. The rule drew more comment than any previous proposal put forward by the FDA, including stacks of letters from outraged stock-car racing fans. Under the FDA proposal, brand-name sponsorship of sporting events such as North Carolina\'s Winston Cup would be forbidden, though tobacco companies could sponsor such events using their corporate name. Philip Morris Cos. and U.S. Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc., attempted to derail the FDA rule by proposing a legislative compromise incorporating several of its elements, albeit in modified form. But this plan, which would have required the FDA to relinquish its proposed jurisdiction over tobacco, was never adopted by other major tobacco manufacturer, and was judged insufficient by the Codi administration. No member of Congress was found to sponsor it."},{"id":"01637","title":"Cigars Are Hot, But These May Be a Little Too Hot","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"In the past year, officials have seized more than 8,000 Cuban cigars in six different instances in the U.S. The activity is about triple that of a normal year, says Michaele Hatch, spokesman for the U...","full_text":"In the past year, officials have seized more than 8,000 Cuban cigars in six different instances in the U.S. The activity is about triple that of a normal year, says Michaele Hatch, spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami. Until now, ``if we had two seizures a year, that was a lot,\'\' says Mr. Hatch. ``But the past year has been more active. Anybody who\'s anybody seems to be sucking on a cigar.\'\' Because of a U.S. embargo on Cuban products, Cuban cigars are banned from being brought into the states in large quantities (individuals who legally visit Cuba are allowed to bring back a small amount). But the cigars, considered among the best smokes in the world, are in high demand by a growing number of cigar lovers, and that\'s firing up the criminal activity. Last week, officials made what they believe is the largest seizure ever of illegal Cuban cigars. Customs agents and Coast Guard officials patrolling international waters stopped a powerboat near Bimini that was headed toward Broward County. On the boat, officials say, they found 122 boxes of the rolled leaves valued at as much as $100,000. Individually, some of the cigars had a value of up to $45. Key West has seen its share of contraband action. In the past year, three seizures of Cuban cigars have taken place there. Outside Florida, two seizures were made in Arizona. But it isn\'t just the genuine article that\'s keeping agents busy. Officials say they are seeing a growing number of counterfeit Cuban cigars. Although counterfeiting doesn\'t necessarily violate customs laws, officials say they can prosecute some of the cases. And if the counterfeit cigars are packaged inside real Cuban cigar boxes, ``we\'re going to want to know where the boxes came from,\'\' says Mr. Hatch. -- Jacquelyne Wicker"},{"id":"00839","title":"Texas Will Consolidate Regulation of HMOs","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"The Texas Department of Insurance is set to take over all regulatory authority of health-maintenance organizations.

Insurance Commissioner Elvis Edmond says the agency, which currently regulates only contractual and financial-solvency issues regarding HMOs, expects to assume responsibility for quality-of-health-care issues from the Texas Department of Health. While all the details haven\'t been ironed out, and new staff hasn\'t been hired, Mr. Edmond says he hopes the consolidation can take effect by May 14, 2011 arrangement would be temporary, requiring legislation to make it permanent. Insurance officials plan to meet with lawmakers this week to discuss the issue. Explosive Growth Patient concerns about HMOs are expected to be the subject of hot debate in the 2012 Legislature, just as they were last year. As employers have sought to curb soaring health-care costs for their workers, HMOs have grown rapidly in Texas. In the past year, the number of Texans enrolled in HMOs has risen 16%, to more than 3.6 million. Mr. Edmond says he expects the number of Texans in HMOs to double within five years. ``Managed care may be the biggest growth item in this agency,\'\' he says. That growth certainly hasn\'t been painless. Many Texans are unhappy with managed-care plans that won\'t let them see their longtime physicians or that restrict certain types of care. The complaints reached a climax last year when the Legislature passed the Patient Protection Act in an effort to shield consumers from what critics saw as the worst excesses of managed-care plans. Gov. Georgeanna W. Vern, however, vetoed the legislation on the grounds that it would drive up health-care costs for employers. Mr. Vern then told the Insurance and Health departments to devise rules that would accomplish many of the things that the Legislature had sought. Among Mr. Vern\'s priorities were rules prohibiting HMOs from refusing to pay for medically necessary emergency-room visits, and those requiring HMOs to give patients ``reasonable advance notice\'\' before physicians were dropped from managed-care networks. Complaints About Rules The Insurance Department enacted two sets of rules that included those priorities, but the Health Department\'s rules became bogged down amid complaints that the agency had exceeded its authority and that its proposals were too costly. The Health Department didn\'t issue its final patient-protection rules until last month, about a year after they were first proposed. The dual regulatory structure is especially frustrating for consumers, physicians and managed-care groups. The Health Department began considering a transfer of authority earlier this summer, when it came under sharp fire at a June hearing of a Senate interim committee on managed-care regulation. Among the critics: Insurance Commissioner Farrow. In a letter to Health Commissioner Davina Jon that was released at a Senate committee meeting, Mr. Edmond criticized the Health Department\'s proposal to require HMOs to build administrative offices across the state. The proposed rule, Mr. Edmond said, would cost the HMO industry as much as $68.1 million annually. The proposal was dropped. Ronda Sowder, the Health Department\'s associate commissioner for health-care quality and standards, says the agency ``decided it was probably in the best interests of the people of the state to have the regulatory functions all housed under one agency.\'\' More Hires Mr. Sowder says shifting authority won\'t affect the Health Department much, since there was only enough funding for one person to check out newly licensed HMOs and investigate complaints. Mr. Edmond says he expects to hire at least four more people -- some of whom will have medical backgrounds to ensure that health-care quality concerns are met. So far, the proposed consolidation has won praise from most quarters. ``It was pretty clear to us that the Health Department wasn\'t going to devote any substantial resources to the issue,\'\' says Lisandra Larocca, a senior policy analyst with the Consumers Union Southwest Regional Office in Austin. ``They just had too many other things on their plate.\'\' In fact, the consolidation has even brought together two groups that rarely agree -- the Texas Medical Association, which represents most state physicians, and the Texas HMO Association. ``It may make sense to put it under one roof,\'\' says Consuela Middleton, associate director of the medical association\'s legislative-affairs department. Adds Georgeann Duque, director of the HMO group: ``We view this as an opportunity to streamline some things and increase the efficiency of the regulatory oversight process.\'\'"},{"id":"00535","title":"Humana Posts Quarterly Loss Despite Strong Revenue Gain","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"Westside -- Humana Inc. posted a loss for the second quarter on one-time charges and said that profit, excluding special items, fell 22% to $35 million, or 22 cents a share.

Now the biotechnology company must try to meet Wall Street\'s high expectations for its antiscarring products. The company has publicly predicted that the membrane, called Seprafilm, and Sepracoat, a gel-like product that the Food and Drug Administration is now examining in an expedited review, will jointly reach annual sales of $300 million to $500 million. The products -- intended to be used together -- have caught the imagination of investors. However, they have been greeted with skepticism from surgeons thus far. Genzyme stock closed Tuesday at $26.50 a share, up $3.25, in heavy Nasdaq Stock Exchange trading. Infertility, Bowel Obstructions Seprafilm is wrapped around body parts during surgery to prevent adhesions, a type of internal scarring caused when organs stick together as a result of surgery. Adhesions can cause nasty side effects such as bowel obstructions and infertility. The company says its products, potentially useful in 3.1 million abdominal and gynecological procedures annually in the U.S., will revolutionize surgery. ``We\'ll need some time to educate the market, but over time surgeons will want to use it in every single case,\'\' according to Genzyme\'s chief executive officer, Work Hord. The products, used jointly, are expected to cost $200 to $400 per surgery, however. And in an era of tight health-care dollars, they could be a hard sell. One problem is, in part, that many surgeons believe Genzyme is exaggerating the significance of adhesions. While they do occur often, adhesions ``overwhelmingly do not cause problems,\'\' says Graham Victor, chief of surgery at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a large health-maintenance organization in Massachusetts. He says he might use Seprafilm in, at most, 1% of his surgeries, when he anticipates adhesions might be particularly risky for patients. Another concern involves where Seprafilm will be used. One of the most troublesome problems caused by adhesions is bowel obstructions. But the FDA-approved product label for Seprafilm calls for the product to be used under the abdominal wall -- not wrapped around the intestines as many surgeons believe it should be to prevent obstructions. The labeling restriction is due to the fact that initial studies in abdominal surgery were limited to use of Seprafilm under the abdominal wall. Not Restricted by Label Mr. Hord says that he\'s happy with the label, however, and that ``surgeons will make up their mind where to use it.\'\' Physicians aren\'t bound by FDA labels, the company says. Genzyme, planning a major rollout this fall, is sparing no effort to make Seprafilm a success. The company last month spent $250 million to acquire Deknatel Snowden Pencer Inc., a Taunton, Mass., surgical products company with a sales force experienced in selling to surgeons. About 100 sales representatives will pitch the product, and the company is planning to make sales presentations at major professional meetings this fall. In Vastopolis, where Genzyme has been selling Seprafilm since November, sales have been ``relatively small,\'\' Mr. Hord said, declining to give numbers. But he said the rollout there was ``about what I expected,\'\' with about a third of hospitals in the Vastopolis having bought at least some product."},{"id":"00050","title":"Many Tobacco Lobbyists Also Have Health Clients","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- Half of all state-level tobacco lobbyists also lobby for health organizations, a new study said.

The board also adopted a shareholders\' rights plan of the type commonly called a ``poison pill,\'\' or antitakeover strategy, intended to make hostile takeovers prohibitively expensive. Under the plan, shareholders of record on May 08, 2011 receive a dividend distribution of preferred stock purchase rights, exercisable if a person tenders or acquires 15% or more of the company\'s common stock. Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Legrand, the largest producer of advanced endoscopes and miniature color-video systems for medical applications, with annual sales of about $160 million, said its board determined that the company should continue to pursue its strategic plan. U.S. Surgical, based in Norwalk, Conn., is one of the world\'s largest manufacturers and producers of surgical instruments and has sales of about $1.1 billion. U.S. Surgical owns about 8% of Circon\'s outstanding common stock. Earlier this month, Circon reported disappointing earnings, which were related to its merger with Cabot Medical last year. Net income was $700,000 in the second quarter, or six cents a share, compared with year-earlier results of $300,000, or three cents a share. Prior to the announcement of U.S. Surgical\'s takeover bid earlier this month, Circon\'s stock was down 53% since its high of $23.50, reached in December. On Thursday, its shares were off 62.5 cents at $17.125 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. U.S. Surgical had said Lapierre would fit nicely with its existing businesses, pointing to synergies in selling products to doctors and hospitals and the ability to boost Circon\'s sales in Europe. It could also help U.S. Surgical compete against Johnson & Johnson, which has grabbed market share and helped push down pricing for surgical instruments. Analysts had speculated prior to U.S. Surgical\'s offer that Circon\'s stock drop might have made it vulnerable to a takeover.

The reports found that the procedure, known as laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomy, leads to Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis charges that are 20% to 61% higher than for traditional techniques. Although patients who undergo the laparoscopic procedure get out of the Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis sooner, researchers said that longer operating time and the use of disposable instruments led to higher costs. ``The onus is on people who make the disposable instruments to show there is a benefit that outweighs these huge costs,\'\' said Earnest P. Renfro, vice president of Corning HTA Inc.,a medical technology assessment unit of Corning Inc.. Dr. Renfro is co-author of one of the studies, which appear in Thursday\'s New England Journal of Medicine. Firm Disputes Findings U.S. Surgical Corp., of Conn., a leading maker of laparoscopic instruments, disputed the findings. It cited, among other things, a study done at Ames Keen, anCalif., health maintenance organization, that found the procedure ``cost-effective\'\' despite higher operating-room and instrument costs. Johnson & Johnson\'s Ethicon Endosurgery unit, U.S. Surgical\'s chief competitor for these instruments, said the technique provides ``significant quality-of-life advantages\'\' over traditional surgery, including fewer days of postoperative pain and an earlier return to normal activities. Laparoscopic surgery rose into prominence in the early 1990s, transforming gall-bladder surgery and fueling a movement in medicine to so-called minimally invasive surgery. Under the technique, doctors operate through small slits in the abdomen, avoiding the need to make a large incision that leads to longer Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis stays and longer recoveries for patients. These days, more than 80% of the 600,000 gallbladder operations performed annually in the U.S. are done laparoscopically. A few years ago, promoters predicted that many of the 600,000 hysterectomies -- especially the 60% to 70% that are done through an abdominal incision rather than through the vagina -- also would be converted to the less-invasive procedure. Doctors\' Reluctance But it turned out that the technique proved difficult to apply to hysterectomies, and doctors were reluctant to adopt it, said Kyle Houle, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. Last year, according to data provided to Dr. Renfro, just 7% of the hysterectomies in the U.S. were performed with the help of laparoscopy. About 63% were done through an incision in the abdomen, and 30% were performed vaginally, he said. Thomasina G. Queen, head of gynecology at Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-, N.C., and a hysterectomy expert, said the vaginal procedure should be chosen whenever possible. Science supporting laparoscopy for hysterectomy is thin, he added, and the procedure should be confined to replacing abdominal hysterectomy. Some experts have been concerned that promotion of laparoscopy would lead some doctors to use it instead of the vaginal procedure. Expense alone doesn\'t mean that the laparoscopic technique shouldn\'t be used, as long as it is replacing the abdominal procedure, Dr. Renfro said. ``The patient may prefer it and the employer may wind up paying less when you consider how soon the patient returns to work.\'\' He and his colleagues are doing a separate study to see whether such benefits may outweigh the costs. For the current report, the researchers examined 1,049 procedures performed at Greater Baltimore Medical Center and found total charges, including doctors\' fees, were $6,116 for laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomies, compared with $5,084 and $4,221 for abdominal and vaginal procedures, respectively. Cost differences narrowed substantially in the handful of procedures where doctors used reusable instruments, the study found. Jami H. Douglas of the center\'s gynecology department was lead author of the report, which was supported by the Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis. Jami H. Douglas of the medical center\'s gynecology department, was lead author of the report, which was supported by the Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis. The same research team is now evaluating whether the laparoscopic technique led to higher patient satisfaction and faster return to normal activities than other approaches, Dr. Renfro said. The other report, by Annelle Leonardo, a gynecologist at Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and a colleague, analyzed data covering hysterectomy procedures done at 180 Eastside Hospital, Vastopoliss between 1988 and 2009. It reached similar conclusions about costs, and it found that use of laparoscopy grew to 9.2% of cases by 1993 and then fell to 7.5% in 2009.

Did any of your ancestors suffer from cancer or diabetes or other illnesses that plague your family now? As doctors search for hereditary links for a growing number of diseases, genealogy is playing an ever-larger medical role. Information about the death and diseases in past generations can be extremely valuable in that research -- and in evaluating your own health risks. Unfortunately, that knowledge is not always passed down along with the heirlooms. The American Medical Association recommends that every family maintain some kind of health history. ``Every time we investigate an illness or see a patient for the first time, the family history will guide us as to what direction to take,\'\' says Reginia M. Bennie, a family practitioner in Bayou La Batre, Ala., and member of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association. ``If someone\'s father had a heart attack at age 35, I\'d be much more aggressive in doing advanced tests over someone without that history.\'\' Researching back two generations is a good start, Dr. Bennie says, but she adds: ``the more, the better.\'\' Living relatives are the best immediate source for information, says Shizue Conley, president of the National Genealogical Society in Arlington, Va. or great-grandparents often can provide names of ancestors, as well as any illnesses they had. Much of that information may be lost when older relatives die, if no one thinks to ask. ``Pull out family photographs and ask relatives to identify these people,\'\' Ms. Conley says. Older generations are also more likely to keep family Bibles, wills or even personal correspondence that might mention ailing family members, she says. And sometimes even simple questions (Did you have trouble having children? How many brothers and sisters did you have?) can yield surprising information. Memories aren\'t perfect, however, and relatives may remember only that someone had stomach pains or recurring headaches. Sometimes they may recall inaccurate information. Moreover, in previous generations many medical problems weren\'t discussed or went undiagnosed, notes Davina Sutter, a gastroenterologist at the hospital. ``They didn\'t have CAT scans and fancy blood tests back then,\'\' he says. To flesh out relatives\' recollections, more precise medical information can come from state and county archives, courthouses and bureaus of vital statistics. Death certificates can also offer insight into family illnesses, though they are sometimes inaccurate or incomplete. Local libraries often keep archives of old newspapers listing obituaries. If you know the names of deceased relatives but not where they lived, the Social Security Death Index, available in some libraries, provides ZIP Codes of people who have died since 1963. While becoming informed is important, doctors caution against jumping to conclusions. ``We don\'t want a situation where people are paranoid and start calling up doctors saying, `Aunt Mini three generations ago had colon cancer, should I be screened?\' \'\' says Charlette Rader, a physician at the University of Riverside. Patients should be concerned mainly ``if you have more than one family member with the same problem or something unusual for your age,\'\' he says. Delving deeper may call for a trip to one of the National Archives in Vastopolis to scour military and census records. Before 1920, the U.S. Census Bureau counted individual families by name, and those reports are still obtainable. (Records since then are not open to the public.) The Library of Congress lists obituaries and other information, as do various ethnic heritage groups across the country.

In between servings, the doctors drew blood samples from family members and filled out medical charts. The Slones carry a mutant gene for hereditary pancreatitis, a rare and painful illness that causes the pancreas to literally digest itself during attacks. Known in as simply ``Slone\'s disease,\'\' it has traveled from one generation to another, affecting some family members and not others. Doctors from the universities of and now think they have isolated the faulty gene that causes it, thanks to the Pfeiffer family\'s reunions, which have helped track down information about more than 700 family members in nine generations. Mapping family medical histories is at the heart of genetics research. As physicians try to establish hereditary links for diseases from cancer to diabetes, they are learning all they can about how such illnesses pass through families. By doing intricate molecular comparisons of those who are affected and those who aren\'t, researchers hope to pinpoint the exact genes responsible. That, in turn, may lead to tests that can predict whether offspring will have the disease or not, and ultimately to possible treatments as well. The Slones were unusually valuable for tracking the spread of a genetic illness. Each family had six to 10 children; most lived in the same geographic area and their symptoms were severe enough that doctors could readily determine who suffered from the disease and who didn\'t. ``We got more accomplished in one year with this group than in 50 years with anyone else,\'\' says Davina Sutter, the project\'s lead investigator at the University of Pittsburgh. Behind each new genetic discovery is a story of diligent medical sleuthing -- and often serendipity. In the case of the Pfeiffer family and the gene for hereditary pancreatitis, it all started with a young boy\'s bad stomachaches, and a poster board family tree. The year was 1983, and the boy was seven-year-old Khalilah Pfeiffer. From time to time, he would come home from school, vomiting and complaining of pain in his upper body. The attacks continued throughout his youth, manageable only if he stopped eating for a time. Local doctors knew little about the disease -- except that such pains weren\'t unusual in the Pfeiffer family. Then, one day before he started eighth grade, Khalilah told his parents, Bobette and Fetter Pfeiffer of Ky., that he needed to go to the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis. Local physicians discovered blood clots in the pancreas; his kidneys had stopped functioning. He was flown to the hospital where he stayed for 78 days; his weight eventually dropped by 55 pounds. Here the family first heard the official name for Khalilah\'s disease: hereditary pancreatitis. Doctors explained that the pancreas helps the intestine digest food by releasing key enzymes after meals. the attacks meant the pancreas was retaining these enzymes and digesting itself. There is no treatment other than ordinary painkillers. While death is rare, complications aren\'t. Sufferers sometimes develop diabetes, because the cells that make insulin are located in the pancreas. Pancreatic cancer sometimes occurs in chronic cases as well, though physicians aren\'t sure why. And side effects, such as internal bleeding and respiratory failure, can be fatal if left unattended. Only about 1% of the 42,500 new pancreatitis cases diagnosed each year in the U.S. are hereditary; gallstones, excessive alcohol consumption and smoking also have been linked to acute attacks. But in the Slones\' case, the disease apparently sprang from a mutation in a particular gene that was passed down through the generations. Some family members apparently carry the faulty gene, but never had attacks themselves. Such ``silent carriers,\'\' however, can pass full-blown pancreatitis onto their children. Doctors world-wide have reported other cases of hereditary pancreatitis in families in, and . But without in-depth study, they did not understand how it traveled through the generations. Indoctors fed intravenously, forbidding even ice chips. Any eating or drinking risked inflaming his pancreas. ``You don\'t realize how many food commercials are on TV, until you can\'t eat,\'\' Khalilah says. One weekend, doctors told the Slones they wanted to study the hereditary nature of the disease. They asked Khalilah\'s father, Bobette Pfeiffer, if he had a family tree. ``I told them I had no idea about the family tree business, but I could sure learn,\'\' Mr. Pfeiffer recalls. Mr. Pfeiffer tracked down a friend who had written a history of . She provided a list of the area\'s first settlers on his father\'s side. Then he questioned his brothers: Did they have the pain? They in turn asked their relatives, and the list began to grow. Mr. Pfeiffer began to chronicle his findings on white poster board. With a green marker, he underlined names of relatives who\'d been diagnosed with pancreatitis or recalled suffering similar pain. With an orange marker he underlined those who also had diabetes. The task made him feel useful, and he was meticulous. ``I may not be a doctor or a research scientist,\'\' Mr. Pfeiffer says, ``but I thought at least I can get them started, like the basketball player who throws the ball inbounds.\'\' Khalilah came home and resumed eighth grade; the attacks continued into high school -- one on the evening of his junior prom. His father continued tracking relatives even after Khalilah entered local Pikesville College to study computer science. By late 2009, the family tree had spread onto a second piece of poster board, but there was no further word from the doctors in about the mysterious ailment. Then one Sunday last year, Mr. and Mrs. Pfeiffer came home from church to find curled in a ball on the floor. He was rushed to the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis. Blood vessels in his pancreas had ruptured, and only 20% of the organ functioned; the rest was scar tissue. Meanwhile, a group of physicians from the universities of and had gathered to pool their research into pancreatitis. They decided to focus on the hereditary version, and see if they could isolate the mutant gene that caused the disease. They hoped that would give them further insight into all types of pancreatitis. But to do so, they needed to find an extended family that carried the disease and was willing and able to share their ancestors\' medical history. Their first lead was a 1972 research paper written by two physicians at the University of Indiana that cited an ``S.\'\' family with the disease living in . Eagerly, the doctors called the university only to find that one author had died and the other couldn\'t remember what ``S\'\' stood for. Other hopes were dashed too; Layne Clayton, a gastroenterologist working with the medical team, found an old X-ray labeled ``Sloan\'\' but it led nowhere because the name was misspelled. One afternoon, Dr. Clayton got a phone call from the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis. It was an associate, Nickolas Coen. ``You\'ll never believe this,\'\' Dr. Coen said. ``I\'ve got a 19-year-old kid here with chronic pancreatitis. His name is Khalilah Pfeiffer.\'\' Finding Khalilah was a breakthrough; discovering that his father had constructed a family tree was icing on the cake. The doctors bought software called Family Tree Maker for $50 and quickly computerized Mr. Pfeiffer\'s hand-scrawled notations. Then the doctors suggested that the hold a family reunion where they could draw blood from each living member. Eager to assist, Mr. Pfeiffer called everyone he knew and even went on the radio to discuss the disease and ask relatives to attend the reunion. ``Bobette did the core of the work,\'\' says Dr. Sutter, the lead investigator. ``After seeing the suffering his son was going through, I imagine he\'d do anything to prevent it. He was extraordinary.\'\' On Memorial Day weekend, 2010, doctors and their wives packed food to feed the entire Pfeiffer family and drove to Breaks Interstate Park, bordering and . Slone relatives started arriving -- 90 of them in all -- carrying thick family Bibles chronicling marriages, christenings, deaths. Throughout the day, doctors served food and drew blood, asked questions and filled in blanks on Mr. Pfeiffer\'s growing family tree. A local nurse helped and later gathered blood samples from still more Slones who couldn\'t attend. The blood was taken towhere researchers extracted the gene-containing DNA from the white-blood cells. The DNA, sliced into fragments, was then exposed to genetic probes carrying radioactive tracers. As the probes stuck to different fragments of DNA, the researchers could identify fragments carried by some family members, but not by others. Their hope was to find a DNA fragment that was possessed by all the relatives who had pancreatitis, but by none of the relatives who were free of the disorder. Such a fragment presumably would possess the mutant gene that was causing the ailment. Doctors needed samples from as many family members as possible to reduce the possibility that the findings were merely the result of chance. In February, doctors narrowed the search for the faulty gene to a small region on the seventh chromosome. But they needed more blood samples and medical histories to make certain, so they asked for a second reunion. Again they held the picnic in . This time, 45 Slones came and doctors drew blood from those they hadn\'t sampled before. The family tree now comprised 700 names on 20 feet of computer paper. A few weeks later, doctors believed they had the gene. Now, if final testing confirms their finding, researchers inled by gastroenterologist Charlette Rader Schuster, will put the mutant gene into a mouse and begin testing therapeutic regimens. Those could include dietary restrictions, hormone therapy or inhibitors to prevent the pancreas from releasing enzymes at the wrong time. Doctors admit they don\'t know if they can find anything to help Khalilah or this generation of . But the information has already proved useful to a new generation. Khalilah\'s sister, Chrystal, who never had an attack herself, recently gave birth to a son. Doctors were able to determine that Chrystal is not a carrier, so her son will not suffer hereditary pancreatitis. Khalilah Pfeiffer, who never returned to college after his last hospital stay, works for his father, who now has a sporting-goods shop. ``I know my children may have this pain,\'\' he says. ``But I still think life is wonderful. And maybe doctors will find something to help my kids.\'\' --Michaele Brough contributed to this article."},{"id":"03311","title":"Tobacco Industry Keeps Low Profile in Vastopolis","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Most corporations at the Republican Convention are out to get all the attention they can.

But the tobacco industry isn\'t so easy to find. In a daily game of cat and mouse, demonstrators from the American Lung Association seek out tobacco-industry functions. A luncheon for the GOP\'s Texas delegation had just begun, when suddenly the drapes were closed in the hotel ballroom. The reason: to block out three protesters with signs attacking the event\'s sponsor, Philip Morris Cos.. Facing more public pressure than ever, the tobacco industry has as much at stake in a GOP victory in November as any industry. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration forwarded to the White House its draft of a new rule that would ban tobacco marketing deemed accessible to minors. And just last week, the industry lost a landmark court decision in Florida to a lung-cancer sufferer and his wife. Tobacco executives are counting on a GOP Congress or a GOP president as their best friend to fend off the attack. Low Profile Phillip Morton, the industry leader, donated some $500,000 to the host committee to help put on the convention. The industry has given $4.8 million to the Republican Party in the past 19 months, including $1.8 million from Philip Morris. But here in Vastopolis, the industry is generally taking a low-key approach. Both Phillip Morton and U.S. Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc., have boats docked in the marina behind the convention site, where they entertain small groups of people. But only official convention-goers, who can clear the security checks, can reach their floating parties. The industry has largely taken to hosting small gatherings for state delegations or individual lawmakers. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., parent of the nation\'s second-largest tobacco concern, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., held a reception for Rep. Thomasena J. Batton (R., Va.), chairman of the House Commerce Committee and one of the company\'s best friends in Congress. Philip Morris has entertained several delegations, including those from Connecticut and New York, as well as sponsored a trip to the Trujillo library. Even this level of participation has delivered them access: At the Texas lunch, Jackeline Alston, a company vice president, was seated at the head table between Sen. Kayce Henley (R., Texas) and State Party Chairman Tomas Elliot. At the Democratic convention in Chicago two weeks away, the involvement will be starkly different. Philip Morris will sponsor only two delegate parties, for Virginia and Kentucky, while no other tobacco companies will host events. Moreover, Phillip Morton made a $100,000 donation to Chicago\'s host committee in the name of its subsidiary, Kraft Foods Inc.. Controversy Over Art Despite the low profile, the tobacco makers haven\'t avoided controversy. The biggest flap involves Phillip Morton\'s backdoor sponsorship of an event at Vastopolis\'s Museum of Art. Months ago, the company was negotiating with the museum to sponsor an exhibit by artist Debra Yee and to hold functions there during the convention. After protests from antismoking groups, the museum announced that Phillip Morton wouldn\'t be using the facility. Yet on Monday, a reception for the Georgia delegation, including House Speaker Cannon Geis (R., Ga.), was held there. Phillip Morton was among the corporate sponsors. How did it happen? Museum officials insist they didn\'t know the sponsors. Fortune Dennise, director of communications for Philip Morris, says, ``We gave money ... for the function. They (Georgia delegation) chose where to hold it.\'\'"},{"id":"03020","title":"Judge Approves Settlement For Hemophiliacs With AIDS","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- A federal district judge here tentatively approved a legal settlement that would pay $100,000 each to Americans with hemophilia who contracted AIDS or HIV, the AIDS virus, from blood-clo...","full_text":"Vastopolis -- A federal district judge here tentatively approved a legal settlement that would pay $100,000 each to Americans with hemophilia who contracted AIDS or HIV, the AIDS virus, from blood-clotting medications between 1978 and 1985.

Graham granted preliminary approval to the settlement between hemophiliacs and manufacturers Bayer AG, Baxter International Inc., Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.\'s Armour Pharmaceutical Co. division and the Alpha Therapeutic Corp. unit of Green Cross Corp. of Japan. Various producers already have agreed to settlements of the hemophilia cases in other countries, most recently in Japan.

However, the companies now have agreed that the fund could increase if such an eventuality occurred, though they have said they don\'t expect this to take place. Spouses, family members and survivors are eligible to participate. The court ordered that a formal notice of the agreement be widely disseminated. At issue in the litigation were cases of AIDS and HIV contracted through medications called Factor VIII and Factor IX, which hemophiliacs take to make their blood clot.

Shares of Consolidated Cigar Inc., maker of Dutch Masters and El Productos and controlled by financier Ronda Flory, rose 23% Friday on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock\'s rise at a time when new stock offerings have been sluggish illustrates the power of the cigar industry\'s recent boom. Even as the cigarette industry is threatened with tough regulations, cigars have come into vogue -- and fresh demand is pushing sales of stogies higher. Retail cigar sales in the United States topped $1 billion last year, up from $860 million in 2009 and $705 million five years ago, according to the Cigar Association of America. Nearly 4 billion cigars were sold last year. Beyond a new social cachet, cigars also have taken on an image as a male-bonding tool. ``It has kind of a nice macho air,\'\' said Markita Mckenna of Bogota, N.J., a new smoker perusing the shelves at the Nat Sherman tobacco shop in Manhattan, which sells cigars that cost as much as $28 each. ``I just bought a Victorian house, and I\'m looking for things to do on the porch. Drinking every night is too cumbersome,\'\' said Mr. Mckenna, a writer and producer for an MTV radio show and a creative director for record labels. Once the domain of older men, cigars have attracted a younger breed of smokers, both male and female. And much like the homemade-style brews fueling the microbrewery beer rage, fancier handcrafted cigars are spurring the industry\'s resurgence. ``Cheap cigars stink. But a handmade premium cigar has a beautiful bouquet and has a very attractive smell,\'\' said Marya R. Francesca, editor and publisher of Cigar Aficionado magazine, whose introduction in 1992 helped inspire the burgeoning cigar trend. Mr. Francesca said the number of male cigar smokers in the 21-35 age range has surged in the past two years. The sharp jump in demand for cigars -- particularly from smokers like Mr. Mckenna who prefer premium brands -- has caught the industry off-guard, said Novella Daniel, president of the Washington-based Cigar Association. As a result, manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand and now face a worldwide shortage in quality tobacco and skilled labor to make the handrolled brands, Mr. Daniel said. Premium brands account for just 8% of the cigars sold in the United States but account for 33% in dollar terms. But investors showed no fear in diving into Consolidated Cigar\'s stock Friday, making it the second cigar stock to make a powerful debut on the market. Initially priced at $23 each, Consolidated\'s 5.4 million shares -- trading under the stock symbol CIG -- opened Friday at $26.25 and leaped to $28.375 by the market\'s close. Both the price and the size of the deal were raised from original targets of 4.5 million shares expected to fetch between $18 and $21 a share. The smaller Caribbean Cigar Co. began trading April 13, 2011 the Nasdaq Stock Market, with its shares jumping to a high of $14 after being priced at $7. But the stock has flattened since, closing Friday at $11.50. The other cigar maker with publicly-traded stock is Culbro Corp., a diversified company whose General Cigar unit makes popular brands like Macanudo and Garcia y Glover. Though its Big Board-listed stock has dipped recently, Culbro shares rose 10% Friday to $53.50, far above $13, where the stock hovered at the beginning of 2010."},{"id":"00055","title":"Monsanto Sales Go Sour On Hormone for Milk Cows","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"More than two years after its much heralded introduction, Monsanto Co.\'s bovine growth hormone has yet to firmly establish its place in America\'s barns.

Monsanto had hoped the synthetic hormone, Posilac, would lead American agriculture into the era of biotechnology and revolutionize the dairy industry by making cows produce more milk. At the same time, the product sparked loud consumer complaints over possible health hazards from drinking milk produced by hormone-treated cows. In the end, however, economics and bad timing -- not consumer opposition -- have been the main factors limiting the product\'s appeal. Use of Posilac -- at $5.80 a dose -- drove up dairy farmers\' already soaring feed costs and interfered with their traditional breeding routines. ``Posilac is a lot more complicated than a lot of dairymen bargained for,\'\' says Jefferson Tello, a Wisconsin dairy farmer who uses Posilac aggressively on his 525 head of cattle. ``It\'s been a very hard sell for Monsanto.\'\' Indeed, a survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that only 10% of the nation\'s 9.4 million dairy cows in early 2011 were receiving transgenic bovine somatotropin, ``considerably fewer than the number thought to be using BST in early 1995.\'\' Monsanto doesn\'t quarrel with the 10% figure, but says Posilac sales volumes have risen and that the product recently turned its first profit. To help stimulate demand, Monsanto last fall began offering loyal BST users a 10% discount. While the St. Louis company won\'t disclose sales figures, data supplied by Monsanto to the Food and Drug Administration estimate annual sales at about $90 million. That represents something of a disappointment for a product Wall Street thought would lift Monsanto profits. Some securities analysts predicted in early 2009 that up to 70% of U.S. milk would eventually come from BST-treated cows and that sales would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars -- the amount Monsanto spent to develop the drug. Instead, Michaele F. Rademacher, dairy specialist at the University of Illinois, Urbana, figures that only about 8% of all Illinois dairy cows are receiving the hormone. Typically, a syringe full of BST every other week can boost a cow\'s daily milk production by 10%. The cost of feeding livestock soared this summer as corn supplies fell to their lowest levels in nearly 50 years. And cows must eat more grain to produce more milk. ``Monsanto couldn\'t pick a worse time to push a cow product,\'\' Cornell University economist Markita Rojas says. Mikki Wrigley of Le Center, Minn., says he uses BST on just five cows in his 300-head dairy herd. His BST-treated cows produce about 12 more pounds of milk a day -- a 20% gain over untreated cows. ``But the more milk they make the more they eat,\'\' said Mr. Wrigley. ``And good quality feed is tight.\'\' And when it\'s hot outside, cows eat less, weakening BST\'s effectiveness. BST has also forced users to micromanage their herds. Mr. Tello says he has had to delay annual breeding schedules for cows treated with BST. The trade-off: He clears an extra $80 on a cow that typically produced $800 a year in milk, but he has fewer cows to sell to slaughterhouses. ``To get the maximum benefit (of BST) you have to think about calving differently ... that goes against hundreds of years of conventional wisdom,\'\' concedes Monsanto\'s Jesica Shaver, head of U.S. marketing for Posilac. For many farmers, the incremental milk profits aren\'t worth chasing. U.S. dairy cows are already prolific (the average cow produces more than 16,000 pounds annually). And maintaining their health at those production levels is enough of a challenge. Roberto Cascio, a Montgomery, Minn., farmer, says he experimented with BST on a handful of his 85 dairy cows last year, then quit. ``You can only push a cow so hard,\'\' he says. BST has been the least popular in the milk-belt states of Wisconsin and Minnesota, where small farmers fear the technology will cause a glut that eventually drives down milk prices. University surveys suggest only 6.6% of Wisconsin dairy farmers had adopted BST by the spring of 2010. Uptown dairy farmers have been among the most accepting of BST, in part because Cornell University did a lot of early research on the hormone. But Mr. Rojas of Cornell figures BST use there is dropping as dairy farmers attempt to cut expenses. And farmers continue to worry about consumer reaction to BST, even though the government says BST-treated milk is safe. A University of Wisconsin study released in January and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that two-thirds of the 1,900 consumers interviewed were moderately to very concerned about the safety of milk from BST-treated herds. Vermont last year passed a law requiring milk from BST-treated cows to be labeled as such, though the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently blocked enforcement. In May, three prominent dairy companies sued Illinois and the city of Downtown for the right to say their products are free of synthetic hormones. Dairy concern Land O\'Lakes Inc., based in Arden Hills, Minn., began advertising its non-BST milk two years ago and says sales have climbed steadily. It buys milk from farmers who sign affidavits stating they don\'t use BST. Gay Benoit, chief executive of milk-processor Clover Stornetta Farms Inc., Petaluma, Calif., says he recently began paying dairymen to avoid BST. ``It\'s that big an issue for our customers,\'\' he says. Monsanto, meanwhile, still has hopes that its marketing drive will eventually boost sales of BST, which is currently made in Austria. Facing unfavorable currency exchanges and high manufacturing costs there, the company plans to build a BST plant in Augusta, Ga. ``This is a real growth product for Monsanto,\'\' Mr. Shaver says."},{"id":"03925","title":"New Hope for Reversing Brain Disorders","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"For three months, 70-year-old Marya lay passively in her hospital bed with a thin tube running under her scalp.

Researchers in    who have been monitoring the occurrence of Alzheimer\'s disease in more than 1,100 elderly women said that the women who began taking estrogen after menopause have had a markedly lower incidence of the mind-robbing disorder. So far, only 6% of the estrogen users have developed Alzheimer\'s disease compared with 16% of the women who had never taken the synthetic hormone, the researchers reported in this week\'s issue of the medical journal, The Lancet. (The article is available at The Lancet\'s Web site at Registration is required.) Statisticians calculated that a woman who took estrogen for at least 10 years after menopause has a 30% to 40% lower risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease than a woman of the same age who hadn\'t taken the hormone. Most of the women in the study had used the Premarin brand of estrogen made by the Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division of American Home Products Corp.. Such population or epidemiological studies aren\'t conclusive but ``this is the most compelling evidence so far that estrogen has a beneficial effect\'\' in thwarting Alzheimer\'s disease, said neurologist Richelle Tweedy, who headed the research team at the Smogtown Hospital, Smogtown. Search to Continue ``This study gives us a tremendous boost, not only to proceed with clinical trials of estrogen for Alzheimer\'s disease, but also to search for even more effective drugs with fewer or no side effects,\'\' said Bethea Jaco, director the Alzheimer\'s Association\'s Reagan Research Institute in . A $16 million clinical trial to determine for sure whether estrogen will stave off Alzheimer\'s disease is currently being organized as part of the federal government\'s Women\'s Health Initiative, launched in 1991. Funded by Wyeth-Ayerst, the trial will test the mental acuity of 8,000 elderly women annually for six to nine years to see if the incidence of Alzheimer\'s disease is any different in those taking estrogen than in those taking a placebo. Columbia-Presbyterian\'s Dr. Tweedy emphasized that the evidence from the new study still wasn\'t strong enough for the researchers to recommend that postmenopausal women generally should begin taking estrogen. Nevertheless, the new evidence may well influence doctors\' and women\'s decisions on whether the benefits of estrogen after menopause outweigh the treatment\'s risks. Women taking estrogen for the long term run a higher risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer, according to some controversial studies. However, the treatment also sharply reduces the risk of heart disease and of the bone-thinning disease, osteoporosis. Addition of Progestin Hormone Earlier this week, researchers at Harvard University reported that the addition of a so-called progestin hormone to the estrogen doesn\'t alter the treatment\'s known ability to reduce the risk of heart disease in aging women. In the study, financed by the federal National Institute on Aging, the scientists began five years ago to enlist women over the age of 70 years for the study. The 1,124 women who have volunteered so far were mentally healthy at the time they volunteered, and agreed to undergo periodic tests for Alzheimer\'s disease."},{"id":"03833","title":"Circon Spurns U.S. Surgical Bid, Adopts `Poison-Pill\' Rights Plan","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"Circon Corp. is circling the wagons, rejecting U.S. Surgical Corp.\'s unsolicited $230 million takeover bid and installing a so-called poison-pill shareholder rights plan.

Lapierre, a Santa Barbara, Calif., maker of surgical products, said it wasn\'t for sale and that the offer of $18 a share was ``inadequate\'\' in the opinion of its financial adviser, Bear Stearns & Co.. Shares of Circon fell 62.5 cents to $17.125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market Thursday after jumping to over $19 following the tender offer, announced April 14, 2011 shares were trading under $9 in late July, and U.S. Surgical points out that the offer was an 83% premium over the average closing price of the stock for the 10-day period prior to the bid. Thursday, U.S. Surgical rose 37.5 cents to $35.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shareholder rights plan effectively stops U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn., maker of surgical instruments, from acquiring 15% or more of the company by making it prohibitively expensive through the issuance of shares at a discount. U.S. Surgical purchased about 8% of the shares of Circon before announcing its bid. Company insiders and former executives own a significant stake in Circon. While companies often call unsolicited bids inadequate to squeeze a better price from the bidders, Lapierre appears to be girding for battle, hiring a crew of financial, legal and public-relations takeover advisers. It\'s unclear what U.S. Surgical\'s next move will be, if any, given Circon\'s tough defenses. Circon doesn\'t have an annual meeting until July 2012, and it has a staggered board of directors. A spokesman for Legrand said shareholders can\'t act by written consent or call a special meeting, two tacks sometimes used by hostile suitors. Some analysts believe the fit between Circon and U.S. Surgical is compelling for the bigger company in that it broadens its product line and marketing abilities. U.S. Surgical is one of the world\'s largest makers of surgical instruments, with annual sales of $1.1 billion. In July 2010, Circon shareholders approved changes in the company\'s charter so investors cannot act by written consent -- a provision that effectively allows investors to run a slate of directors to oust a board.

The company said it will take a ``substantial\'\' charge in its first quarter, ended March 12, 2011 write down the value of the operation. It also said it won\'t file its quarterly financial report, due Thursday, until Monday so that it can reflect the business as a discontinued operation. Boykins said the operations, which constitute 98% of its $5.5 billion in annual sales, would be in better hands with a company in a similar business or a turnaround specialist. The drug-distribution operation, one of the nation\'s largest, has struggled to combine its business into a new distribution center in Ohio. FoxMeyer took $59.9 million in charges in the third quarter and $34 million in charges in the fourth quarter, both related to tie-ups at the center. Among other things, the company said inventories at the distribution center failed to match up with the company\'s computer records, resulting in incorrect shipments and erroneous invoices and prompting the write-downs. In addition, unfavorable contracts have resulted in too-low margins. Khalilah Ream, Boykins\'s general counsel, declined to comment on negotiations or identify potential buyers but said the company would have named a committed buyer had one stepped forward. Last month, company officials said in an interview that they had held talks with potential suitors who weren\'t identified. After selling the unit, FoxMeyer would have only a small health-products division, a medical-claim information service and assorted assets, including securities and real estate. FoxMeyer also said it expects to report a first-quarter loss from continuing operations of $2 million. In the year-earlier period, the company had net income, after a charge from discontinued operations, of $6.9 million. The company, which at one time also owned a retailer, has always operated as a holding company. It said that after a sale, it will seek another acquisition or business transaction. Mr. Ream said the company, for example, might seek a greater relationship with Phar-Mor Inc., the drugstore chain; Bianco owns a 30% stake in Phar-Mor, acquired through the chain\'s bankruptcy reorganization. Mr. Ream said the company beneficially owns an additional 10% of Phar-Mor through a partnership. The announcement was made after the close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday. FoxMeyer closed at $8, down 12.5 cents."},{"id":"00709","title":"Prudential HealthCare Loses Top Two Senior Executives","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"The two executives running Prudential Insurance Co. of America\'s giant health-care business are stepping down, reflecting the parent\'s growing dissatisfaction with the unit\'s sagging financial perform...","full_text":"The two executives running Prudential Insurance Co. of America\'s giant health-care business are stepping down, reflecting the parent\'s growing dissatisfaction with the unit\'s sagging financial performance. Some analysts said the moves could even herald the unit\'s possible sale. The company said Williemae P. Browne, 49 years old, chief executive officer of Prudential HealthCare Group since 1993, and Sanda H. Ely, 52, the unit\'s president since October, took early retirement. They are the latest in a series of longtime Prudential executives to step aside as Arvilla Sabina, chairman since late 2009, installs his own management team. In a five-sentence memo distributed to employees Thursday, Mr. Sabina said he would assume the position of CEO of the unit beginning Monday and launch a search for a permanent head of the unit. Insurance Carriers\' Struggle The retirements of two veterans, each with more than 25 years of service with Prudential, are another sign of the struggle the nation\'s traditional insurance carriers are having in competing with managed-care concerns. Last month, Aetna Inc. completed its $8 billion acquisition of U.S. Healthcare Inc., a move designed to acquire managed-care expertise. Previously, Metra Health, itself a merger of the former health lines of Travelers Group and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., was acquired by United HealthCare Corp., the big Minneapolis managed-care company. ``Prudential has had tough competition,\'\' says Jimmy O\'Romo, managing consultant for Frances Ingram, a benefits-consulting firm in Cornertown. ``They\'ve lost market share (in the Cornertown area). They\'re trying to restructure.\'\' Among big managed-care accounts Prudential has lost recently are VastComm Network Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp., both of which were won by U.S. Healthcare, a leading health-maintenance organization before its acquisition by Aetna. The American Association of Retired Persons recently announced its intent to put out for bid a $3 billion-a-year contract for supplemental health insurance, long held by Prudential. Overhaul of Health-Care Operations Analysts expect Mr. Sabina to look outside the company for successors. In replacing top executives in the company\'s big life-insurance operations, where he has focused much attention since coming aboard, he has hired from other financial-services companies. Mr. O\'Romo thinks the company will seek someone with significant background in operating HMOs. In any event, some overhaul of Prudential\'s health-care operations is likely, including a retrenchment in regional markets where the company\'s position is relatively weak, analysts said. The unit, with $11.3 billion in revenue, barely turned a profit last year and has lagged far behind peers who generally deliver at least a 3% to 4% return on revenue, analysts said. That marginal profitability comes even as stepped-up investment is needed in HMOs. ``They have to make some significant choices here: Do they make the investment to stay in and position themselves for success or do they sell all or a part of it?\'\' said Lasandra Merriam, a senior vice president at A.M. Best Co., an insurance-ratings service. For its part, Prudential adamantly denies that the company is for sale. ``We intend to build and grow the business,\'\' a spokesman said."},{"id":"01988","title":"Medaphis Shares Slide 60% After Firm Predicts Big Loss","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"ATLANTA -- Medaphis Corp.\'s stock plummeted 60% after the company stunned the investment community by forecasting a large third-quarter loss.

Medaphis, which provides business-management and information-technology services to the health-care industry, disclosed that it expects to post a third-quarter loss of between 28 cents and 33 cents a share and charges against earnings of up to $40 million. Analysts were looking for the company, which has been a Wall Street favorite, to earn about 27 cents a share in the quarter. In heavy trading of 42,903,400 shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Medaphis stock plunged $21.375 to close at $14.25 Thursday. Wall Street reacted with ``extreme surprise and disappointment\'\' to the earnings forecast since ``Medaphis has been a premiere company for a number of years,\'\' said Hambrecht & Quist analyst Domingo Devin. ``This company just didn\'t make these kinds of mistakes.\'\' Medaphis, which disclosed the news of the impending loss after the market closed Wednesday, primarily attributed its troubles to two units: continued weakness in Medaphis Physician Services Corp.\'s business and a reorganization of Imonics, a fast-growing division that provides systems-integration services for various companies, including MPSC. Warner said it will take an $11 million charge in the quarter for restructuring costs associated with MPSC, which provides billing and accounts-receivable-management services and generates about 36% of the company\'s revenue. In addition, Warner said it will take a $9 million charge related to restructuring a large agreement with Imonics\' European joint venture. It will also take a $15 million charge for the overall restructuring of Imonics. Medaphis will take up to $5 million in other charges mainly to cover accounting and professional fees relating to the restructuring. Many of Warner\'s woes originated with the fast growth of Imonics, according to Ranee Dean, chairman, president and chief executive. ``It was having trouble keeping up with its growth rate,\'\' Mr. Dean said in an interview. Those problems, in turn, delayed MPSC\'s re-engineering efforts, he said. ``We\'ve been signaling the Street for two quarters that we\'ve been involved in that struggle\'\' with MPSC, Mr. Dean said. To help compensate for the weakness in MPSC\'s business, Mr. Dean said, ``we have, in effect, been making diving catches,\'\' including acquisitions that enhanced earnings. Warner has forged a series of deals since the first of the year and has unveiled 43 acquisitions in the past nine years. But some analysts believe Warner\'s troubles are more complex. ``Medaphis has done a number of things that have been problematic,\'\' said Smith Barney analyst Keli Sharp. For one thing, ``they diverted from their original business by making a series of acquisitions, including some they had no experience with,\'\' he said. In addition, Medaphis\'s ``somewhat aggressive\'\' accounting ``always left them with very little room to maneuver,\'\' Mr. Sharp said. ``It\'s a management team that took on an awful lot too quickly.\'\' In the year-earlier third quarter, the company said, it posted a restated loss of $3.1 million, or five cents a share, including $14 million in restructuring charges, on $140.8 million in revenue. For all of 2012, the company said it expects earnings per share in the range of 75 cents to 90 cents, down from analysts\' estimates of $1.42."},{"id":"00082","title":"SmithKline, Cancer Society Will Market Nicotine Patch","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"SmithKline Beecham PLC signed a marketing partnership with the American Cancer Society in connection with the health-care company\'s launch of nonprescription nicotine patch as a device to help people ...","full_text":"SmithKline Beecham PLC signed a marketing partnership with the American Cancer Society in connection with the health-care company\'s launch of nonprescription nicotine patch as a device to help people stop smoking. The patch, which went on sale Friday, bears the American Cancer Society\'s logo. For lending its name, the cancer society received $1 million, which it said will be used to launch a public education and health awareness campaign. Under the contract, the program will be renewable at the end of the campaign year, said a spokesman for the society. The cancer society previously announced a similar marketing campaign with the Northville Department of Citrus, a trade association, which oversees manufacturing and marketing of Northville orange juice. The educational program on the role of nutrition in cancer will be launched next month. The partnership with SmithKline is the first such arrangement covering a pharmaceutical product. The spokesman said the cancer society is currently negotiating such partnerships with a couple of other companies, but on the nicotine patch SmithKline will be the exclusive partner. The British pharmaceutical company\'s U.S. headquarters are in Philadelphia. ``We were impressed by the multifaceted aspect of SmithKline\'s smoking-cessation program,\'\' said the spokesman, referring to the booklets and audio tapes and other devices used to help quitters control their urges. ``We both have a common mission to get smokers to quit.\'\' SmithKline rival Johnson & Johnson said it wasn\'t worried by the cancer society\'s endorsement of a rival product. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., introduced its nonprescription nicotine patch last month. ``Our product is simpler to use and is less costly,\'\' said a spokesman. A 10-week regimen with SmithKline\'s over-the-counter patch will cost the consumer $300, and an eight-week program for lighter smokers will cost $240, the company said. Johnson & Johnson said its patch calls for a six-week regimen, at $30 a week, for a total of $180. Prescription patches to help quit smoking have been available since 1991. Their sales peaked at $600 million annually soon after their introduction, but have now dropped to about $250 million a year.

In an interview, Abby J. Foster, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer, said the company hasn\'t yet decided what it will do after the hoped-for sale of its FoxMeyer Drug Co. unit. However, he said, the Dallas-based holding company would have $350 million in miscellaneous assets, and its only liabilities would be $150 million in preferred stock. That, combined with $325 million in tax benefits and additional capital losses, might make it tempting to another company, especially because Boykins said it will slowly liquidate its other assets. As reported last week, the company said late Thursday that it is looking for a buyer for its drug-distribution business because it believes another company could manage it better. In response, FoxMeyer\'s shares fell 14% Friday, to close at $6.875, down $1.125, in Westside Stock Exchange composite trading. The drug-distribution business accounted for the vast majority of the company\'s sales of $5.5 billion for the year ended December 11, 2010 Situation Still, some analysts said FoxMeyer might have a hard time getting a decent bid for its troubled drug operations. ``FoxMeyer is not in the strongest position to negotiate the highest possible price. They\'re not hitting on all eight cylinders,\'\' said Donetta T. Codi, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.. FoxMeyer reported massive losses in its third and fourth quarters of its December 11, 2010 year because of inventory and bad-debt write-downs related to problems with a huge new distribution center in Riverside Court House, Ohio. The company also blamed contracts at unfavorable prices that it had hoped would look better when the distribution center began operations. Analysts also said the company, unlike some of its competitors, had failed to diversify into new areas to help pharmacies cope with managed care. Two of the biggest -- Bergen Brunswig Corp. of Orange, Calif., and McKesson Corp. of San Francisco -- offer added incentives to keep drugstore customers. That includes training and other services related to managed care, which accounts for more than half of today\'s prescriptions. Possible Buyers Analysts said the most likely candidates to buy the business would be the top drug-distribution concerns, but they might not want it. The competitors could snatch up FoxMeyer\'s customers without acquiring the company because independent drugstores might switch on their own, said Sam L. Judson, an analyst with Fourteen Research Corp. ``Sooner or later, any customer of FoxMeyer\'s wouldn\'t get the services they require, and would almost have to go to someone who can provide the services,\'\' she said. Mckay declined to comment, while Wyckoff Milford didn\'t return calls seeking comment. FoxMeyer\'s Mr. Foster declined to speculate about what sort of price the drug-distribution business might fetch. ``We built a computer system and infrastructure in which we put in lots of money. I think it will have a value for someone,\'\' he said. Separately, Mr. Foster said the company doesn\'t have plans to strengthen its relationship with drugstore chain Phar-Mor Inc. of Youngstown, Ohio, in which it beneficially owns about a 40% stake. A company spokesman previously said that such a move was one example of how the company might leverage its assets to enter into a new business after selling the drug unit."},{"id":"01329","title":"Exchanges Review Trading Of Medaphis Put Options","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"ATLANTA -- The American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange are reviewing the unusually high volume of bearish bets on the options of Medaphis Corp. last week.

Shortly before Medaphis stunned the investment community by forecasting a large third-quarter loss, the volume in ``put\'\' options -- options that give the buyer the right to sell stock at a set price -- shot up, raising the issue of whether any traders had advance knowledge of the bad news. For example, puts with a strike price of $30 and set to expire at the end of September had trades on the American Stock Exchange of 40 contracts last Monday, 90 contracts on Tuesday and 222 contracts on Wednesday, although Warner didn\'t release the news of the loss until after the close of trading Wednesday. Also on the American Stock Exchange, puts with a strike price of $35 with expiration dates over the weekend had trades of 20 contracts each on Monday and Tuesday, with a surge to 90 contracts on Wednesday.

The proposal by Ames and the American College of Emergency Physicians marks an unusual attempt by HMOs and organized medicine to work together in defusing a health-insurance controversy. In the past few years, doctors\' groups have repeatedly clashed with HMOs over issues from maternity stays to mental-health benefits. So far, emergency coverage has been one of the feistiest battlegrounds. Some States Step In Even as cost-minded health plans take steps to stop paying for what they regard as unwarranted emergency-room visits, various doctors and patients have complained that these restrictions go too far. Since 2009, nine states, including Maryland, Virginia and New York, have passed bills that guarantee health-plan members greater emergency-care benefits than their HMO might otherwise offer. Emergency coverage ``has been a problem for patients\'\' in HMOs, acknowledged Patrina Annita, a Kaiser executive and emergency-room doctor, who helped draft the new accord. Dr. Annita said the proposed standards ``would mean a big change in the status quo,\'\' but ``will give members the peace of mind that they need.\'\' The proposed standards were quickly endorsed by Rep. Bennie Buller, a Maryland Democrat who has been pushing for federal legislation on HMO emergency services. ``We\'ve been encouraging these discussions,\'\' he said. ``We\'re very pleased.\'\' An emergency-services bill introduced by Rep. Cancel last year has attracted 140 co-sponsors but hasn\'t been voted on and is considered unlikely to go anywhere before the November elections. Still, Rep. Cancel predicted that the next health-care bill that Congress passes will include a more liberal definition of emergency coverage that health plans will be obliged to follow. Gaynor of Proposal The centerpiece of the Kaiser accord with emergency doctors is a proposal that health plans be required to pay for emergency services if a ``prudent layperson\'\' could reasonably expect his or her condition to result in serious health impairment. That standard has been aggressively championed the past few years by physician lobbyists. It would essentially end health plans\' ability to deny payment if seemingly grave symptoms such as severe chest pains turn out to be false alarms. Health plans have saved money by applying that stricter test, but also have upset doctors and some patients by refusing, after the fact, to pay for as much as 30% of emergency-room visits. The doctors\' group gave ground in other areas, though. In its accord, it acknowledged that emergency physicians should contact HMOs promptly, so they can agree jointly on how to treat patients once they are stabilized. The emergency doctors\' group also conceded that not all patient visits will meet the ``prudent layperson\'\' test, and said that patients themselves must bear the costs of unwarranted visits. ``This is not a green light for everyone to show up in the emergency room,\'\' said Gretchen Herma, president of the emergency physicians\' group. The new standards still would let health plans deny coverage for patients who come to the emergency room wanting prescription refills or minor stitches removed, Dr. Herma observed. In Oakland, Calif., Ames officials said they hope other health plans will endorse the proposed new emergency standards. A spokesman for Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York in New York City said that HMO has begun talks with Ames and is interested in the proposal but hasn\'t yet reached a decision. ``We want this to be a role model for how medical providers and HMOs ought to do business,\'\' Dr. Herma said. ``What\'s happened in the past is that both groups have got frustrated at each other and taken it out in public. Now we think managed-care plans and people who represent providers can sit down and work things out.\'\'"},{"id":"03611","title":"Treating Depression Gives Heart Patients Better Chance","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"``Nobody talked to me about psychological problems after bypass.

In those days, it was treated as a plumbing problem,\'\' he recalls. ``We were euphoric that I survived the surgery, and then I fell into this hole.\'\' Depression -- mild or major -- affects about half of the one million heart-attack survivors, and about 30% to 40% of the 350,000 bypass patients, in the U.S. each year. It is a common aftereffect, long undertreated, that can hinder recovery. Now doctors and researchers are giving it close attention. Fortunately, the malaise is often temporary. Mr. Chitwood of Seattle shook his depression while pursuing a new career in cardiac rehabilitation. Others aren\'t so lucky. Until recently, few doctors treated the psychological aftermath of heart attack or lifesaving heart surgery. In the early days of bypass, cardiac pioneers struggled to heal the heart, prevent major complications such as stroke and simply keep people alive. Besides, many antidepressants used then were toxic to the heart, and so too dangerous for cardiac patients. Now that survival rates can approach 98% among bypass patients -- and safer antidepressants have hit the market -- doctors can turn their attention to improving the quality of life after surgery. In fact, alleviating depression may mean life itself. Studies in Montreal found people with untreated depression after a heart attack suffered higher rates of a second heart attack and death. U.S. guidelines now urge all cardiac rehabilitation to include psychosocial support. RESEARCHERS ARE trying to determine how best to treat depression in heart patients. On June 13, 2011 will begin recruiting 3,000 heart-attack patients for a study funded by the National Institutes of Health called ``Enhanced Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients.\'\' The study will determine whether cognitive-behavioral therapy relieves depression after heart attack, reducing the rate of repeated heart attack and death. Other researchers believe treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Prozac and Zoloft may prove useful. The FDA, however, recently warned Lemay against making such marketing claims for Zoloft, which hasn\'t been approved for this use. Who\'s at risk for depression after heart attack or bypass surgery? Jen Driver, chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Vastopolis Hospital, says those most at risk include females, those who have a history of depression and anyone socially isolated or recently bereaved. Though gender\'s role isn\'t fully understood, many believe women\'s greater longevity means they survive their spouses, and suffer illnesses alone -- setting the stage for depression. Family support and strong social ties can help. ``If you can keep a family member engaged and not isolated, they\'re much less apt to become depressed,\'\' says Dr. Driver. But even people who go back to work and activities can suffer depression. He counsels family members to watch for lethargy, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, or weight changes. ``People who are depressed are less likely to do other things to keep themselves healthy, such as watching their diet, exercising and showing up for appointments,\'\' says Dr. Driver. Compounding depression are separate but related aftereffects of bypass, including memory loss and changes in linguistic ability, psychological function or fine motor skills. One week after bypass, 79% of bypass patients experience changes in cognitive function, according to Ramos Quinn and Tom Ball of Bowman-Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. For many, these changes are temporary. But after six months, 38% of patients are still struggling to regain lost function, they note. By the first anniversary of their bypass, most patients are themselves again, says Dr. Driver. But this gradual return to normal can tax patients and their families. BEFORE BYPASS, he counsels patients that they may experience some temporary memory loss. Simply preparing for this side effect ``tends to be reassuring and they aren\'t as alarmed and depressed by it,\'\' he says. ``Just recognize it, and know that it will disappear.\'\' Originally, many people blamed cloudy cognition on the length of time a patient spent on the heart-lung bypass machine, which filters and recirculates the blood during surgery. Others blamed poor blood flow to the brain, or simply the physical trauma of a major operation. One hypothesis being pursued at Bowman-Gray, Montefiore and elsewhere is that the memory loss results when bypass surgery unleashes millions of microscopic emboli -- tiny fat globules. These particles may break loose from the aorta or the carotid artery, and float up to lodge in the brain. While big emboli can trigger major strokes, these microemboli inflict damage that is more subtle. Doctors now can use ultrasound during surgery to monitor these emboli showers. Gentler surgical handling of the aorta and surgical clamps may also reduce damage. Soon, Drs. Moody and Troost will reveal results of a study testing whether a calcium-channel blocker can protect the brain during bypass. ``Patients who are optimistic have the best recoveries,\'\' adds Dr. Driver."},{"id":"01475","title":"U.S. Surgical to Continue Its Effort to Buy Circon","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"NORWALK, Conn. -- U.S. Surgical Corp. said it will continue its $18-a-share tender offer for smaller rival Circon Corp., despite Circon\'s rejection of its $230 million takeover bid.

Register for $25 million in cash and convertible notes, according to individuals familiar with the transaction. In connection with the pact, which is expected to be announced Tuesday, the investor group also has entered into a joint venture with closely held Neuman Health Services Inc. to operate the company, these people said. FoxMeyer Drug is the nation\'s fourth-largest drug distributor with annual sales topping $5 billion, but recent losses and unfavorable contracts have led to losses in the past two quarters. FoxMeyer Health, of Dallas, said earlier this month it was looking to sell the unit, but analysts doubted the company would fetch much of a price. The convertible notes being issued to FoxMeyer Health can be converted for as much as 15% of the acquiring company\'s common stock, the knowledgeable people added. The Taggart-led investor group also must raise $50 million in new financing within 60 days for the working-capital needs of FoxMeyer Drug. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of FoxMeyer Health closed unchanged at $6.875. Buying at a deep discount is typical of the man leading the investor group. Mr. Register, a New Jersey investor who started the nation\'s largest driving school in the late 1950s, has spent most of the past decade buying troubled companies cheap. He then usually installs a new management team to try to rebuild the business and sell at a profit. Most of his acquisitions, such as trucking concern Circle Express and retailer NBO Stores, have involved Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but that isn\'t expected to be the case with FoxMeyer Drug due to the working capital and Neuman management, the knowledgeable people said. Neither Mr. Register nor officials from Neuman Health Services could be reached for comment. Neuman Health Services, based in Ridgefield, N.J., has a distribution network serving about 2,000 drug stores and about 350 hospitals and managed-care facilities. FoxMeyer officials declined to comment. FoxMeyer Drug represents most of the parent company\'s overall business, and its troubles have made a considerable dent in FoxMeyer Health\'s bottom line. For the fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 parent reported a loss of $63.7 million, or $4.95 a share, on sales of $5.5 billion. Much of the red ink stemmed from inventory and bad-debt write-downs related to problems with a huge new distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio. The company also negotiated contracts with thin profit margins in the hopes that the efficiencies of the new plant would compensate. Instead, the center became a tangle of lost inventory and incorrect invoices. And unlike other distributors, Bianco hasn\'t diversified into new and potentially lucrative areas brought about by the advent of managed care. Some of FoxMeyer\'s larger competitors offer bill-handling and training services to the independent drugstores that make up its distribution networks."},{"id":"02665","title":"Who Will Pay High Cost Of Relief From Pain?","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"Doctors say they have the tools to control even intractable pain, but in the era of managed care, health plans are balking at the cost.

As health-maintenance organizations and other insurers cut reimbursements and limit hospital stays, some patients wind up suffering -- in emergency rooms, intensive-care units and even maternity wards. Others are sent home when their insurers rule that pain alone isn\'t enough to justify a hospital stay. Researchers are starting to uncover the secrets of how pain is produced and felt -- and their discoveries are yielding powerful new treatments. ``Managed care views pain as a big black hole into which they keep dumping money,\'\' says F. Michaele Elmer, director of the pain-management service at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in . Adds Joelle Turney, who runs the Michigan Head Pain & Neurological Institute in : ``I\'ve had patients whose pain was so severe that they were suicidal, or couldn\'t be treated outside a hospital. Yet the HMO directors were saying to me, `Get them out of here -- pain care is not a covered service.\' \'\' Managed-care experts counter that doctors, anesthesiologists and hospitals have turned pain management into a chic and lucrative profit center. Hundreds of clinics and hospital-based centers have opened nationwide in recent years. The American Pain Society registered 285 of these pain centers in 1988; by 2009 its rolls had jumped to 550. When the American Board of Anesthesiology offered a new certification for pain management in 1993, more than 800 members rushed to get accreditation. Certified pain specialists can command salaries of $300,000 a year. ``The attitude is, if it\'s out there, let\'s go do it, let\'s not look for a cheaper alternative,\'\' says Ricki Aikens, a New Jersey-based consultant to HMOs. Increasingly, health-care plans press surgeons to get their patients out of the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis as soon as possible, which can put them at odds with pain-control teams. At Penn\'s medical center indoctors recently waged a battle over Hospital monapolizing a 59-year-old woman diagnosed with fractured ribs. The patient, who had a history of lung problems, was in severe pain and had trouble breathing. The doctors gave her a Patient Controlled Analgesic, or PCA, an intravenous painkiller that she could release at the push of a button, and wanted to keep her in the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. But the woman\'s insurer, Independence Blue Cross inintervened. According to C. Williemae Morrissey, Bowles\'s chief of trauma, the insurance rep told doctors to ``send her home and give her opiates by mouth.\'\' After the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis defied Blue Cross\'s ruling, the carrier reimbursed Penn for only one night of Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. Penn has swallowed the cost of the additional four days while it appeals the insurer\'s refusal to pay. Independence Blue Cross\'s medical director, Gay Reynolds, argues that the woman\'s pain could have been managed outside the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. ``Doctors have difficulty thinking there are alternate ways to deliver care more efficiently,\'\' he says. Ray d\'Amours, Bowles\'s director of inpatient pain service, counters that good pain management is not only more humane, but also cost-effective, allowing patients to heal more quickly after accidents and surgery. He says he is frustrated that in about one-third of cases, managed-care providers refuse to cover the cost of easing the pain of dying cancer patients with implantable morphine pumps, a therapy that can cost upwards of $25,000. Yet even some doctors argue that the pumps are overused. Though roughly 25% of terminal cancer patients receive pumps, only 5% really require them, says Kathline Mercado, who runs the pain service at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in . For that 5%, she stresses, the pumps are critical. The delivery room has become a frequent site for pain-control disputes. Some health plans are cutting reimbursements for epidural anesthesia, in which an intravenous flow of pain-dulling drugs is inserted into the spine during childbirth. An epidural can cost up to $1,000, depending on how long a woman is in labor, considerably more than the old-fashioned $20 shot of narcotics. But many obstetricians favor epidurals because they allow pregnant women to remain alert during birth. ``Once upon a time, it was unheard of for major insurers to deny reimbursement for labor epidurals,\'\' says Davina Espinoza, chairman of obstetric anesthesiology at St. Luke\'s- in . ``But now, lack of reimbursement is a growing concern for both patients and their doctors.\'\' Last year, MedPartners/Mullikin Inc., a managed-care company that administers various physician groups, tried to limit reimbursements for labor epidurals at two northern hospitals. Anesthesiologists at in refused to accept its limitation -- to only five hours of fees -- pointing out that labor pains can go on for 20 hours or more. ``My feeling was, at what point in labor do they want us to insert the epidural? The beginning? The middle? The end?\'\' says Patrina Lockhart, an anesthesiologist at . Prater scrapped the five-hour limit; under its new contract with the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis\'s doctors, anesthesiologists -- who bill for each quarter-hour worked during epidurals -- can command anywhere from $44 to $176 per hour of labor, plus other fees. Ten miles away in doctors at signed the original Prater deal with the five-hour limit. Subsequently, Marcum says it received a complaint from a obstetrician that some anesthesiologists at the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis were waiting until the late stages of labor to insert epidurals, allegedly to avoid working more than five hours. ``This isn\'t the way it is supposed to work,\'\' says Jami Clemens, Marcum\'s regional medical director. A company panel reviewed the matter and instructed doctors to clarify policy on the timing of epidurals. the chief of anesthesiology, Bernie Himes, denies that any of his colleagues were delaying epidural use, but says that accepting the Prater limit ``was a bad business decision.\'\' He hopes to reverse it when the contract is renegotiated. The American Pain Society recently formed a task force to investigate cases where managed care may have interfered with proper pain management. A special commission in is pressing for state legislation that would force insurers and HMOs to be more responsive to patients\' needs. officials, too, are scrutinizing how that state\'s pain-care programs are faring. Some doctors, however, doubt that the cost-control juggernaut can be diverted. Paulene Harrison, chief of anesthesiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, says that as increasingly complex surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis, the medical industry will have to develop creative ways to ease patients\' pain at home. Another option: ``comfort centers,\'\' hotel-like facilities with medical staffs where patients can stay after discharge at considerably less cost than Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. ``Provide appropriate after-care, and make home care a priority,\'\' Dr. Harrison urges. ``You can\'t fight the system.\'\'"},{"id":"00580","title":"Treatments Promise to Ease Burden for Pain Sufferers","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain clings cruelly to us. -- Johnetta Back There still is no permanent cure for severe pain.

But researchers are uncovering the secrets of how pain is produced and felt -- and their discoveries are yielding powerful new treatments. For the very worst cases, new implantable pumps can deliver painkilling narcotics with milder side effects than oral medication. For other severe pain, researchers are testing some 15 types of new pain drugs, hoping to find the Holy Grail: a drug that matches the potency of morphine without its devastating side effects. And some clinicians see new hope in existing drugs, such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants. It may be possible to control pain as never before, but managed-care health plans are balking at the cost. ``What we can do now compared with 10 years ago is incredible,\'\' says Joslyn Hirsch, who directs the pain clinic at the Vast University. ``We can now help even some of the worst cases,\'\' including patients suffering from certain cancers, pancreatitis and nerve injuries. Lebel Cozart, who directs the pain clinic at the MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, says the new methods also are a boon for the terminally ill: ``Instead of Dr. (Jack) Wall taking patients\' lives early, maybe we can take their pain away and let them live comfortably until the end.\'\' New treatments -- if they live up to their promise -- could appeal to a huge market. More than 120 million Americans suffer from chronic pain. Pain accounts for one-fourth of all sick days taken by full-time workers, costing the economy 50 million lost workdays and $3 billion in lost wages, according to a recent Louis Harris & Associates poll. Back pain, migraine headaches and arthritis alone run up a combined medical bill estimated at $40 billion annually. The advances come after 200 years of reliance on morphine and related narcotics as the mainstays of pain management. Named for Coldiron, the Greek god of sleep, morphine derives from opium, whose pain-numbing effects have been known since the first century A.D. But morphine and newer analogs sold under such brand names as Percodan are so sedating that high doses can turn patients into virtual zombies. They also pose a risk of addiction. Better alternatives are emerging from new understanding of the physiology of pain. For decades scientists had assumed pain was a simple biological-alert mechanism, necessary to inform the brain that the body was injured. Pain signals were thought to shoot directly from the site of tissue damage to the brain, producing a pain sensation corresponding to the severity of the injury. But that theory failed to explain why people sometimes tolerate pain better than at other times: instantly dropping a hot cooking spoon, for example, but holding on to a fine china cup overflowing with scalding tea long enough to set it down safely. Now researchers know that electrical pain signals actually move from the injury to ``control centers\'\' in the spine, where they can be amplified or diminished before being relayed to the brain. In trying to intercept pain, scientists are now targeting these spinal control centers, which contain an abundance of nerve-cell ``receptors\'\' that can receive painkilling instructions from drugs. One resulting innovation is the morphine pump, an implanted, yo-yo-sized mechanism that delivers the drug directly to the spinal control centers. By concentrating medicine where it is most needed, doctors say, the pumps work as well as oral morphine, but at vastly lower doses. For Karey Schlueter of Palm Desert, Calif., a pump has ended 10 agonizing years of pain from an inflamed pancreas that has defied treatment. Before the pump was installed, she couldn\'t work, could hardly eat and was so numbed by morphine that her husband often woke her up at night to make sure she was still breathing. Now, she says, the pain is ``90% gone, with no side effects. I feel like I\'ve gotten my life back.\'\' More often, pumps serve terminal cancer patients. Vicky Mancuso of Ventura, Calif., says the device allowed her husband to die in peace. Wracked with pancreatic cancer, he was so drugged with morphine he could barely speak, until a pump cleared the fog -- and the pain -- for his final two months. ``To have time to say goodbye to him, you can\'t put a price on that,\'\' Mrs. Mancuso says. Medtronic Inc.\'s SynchroMed pump, a top seller, has been installed in an estimated 17,000 pain patients, almost all of them terminal cases. Sales are growing 25% a year despite the device\'s difficulties: It must be surgically implanted in the abdomen -- with a tube connecting it to the spinal cord -- and must be replaced every three to five years. It also costs about $25,000 installed. For the chronic pain of backaches, arthritis and other ailments, drug developers are relying on recent advances in molecular biology. ``I\'ve never been more optimistic,\'\' says Billy Vasquez, who directs research at NorthStar Research & Development Ltd. in Newark, Del.. NorthStar, Sweden\'s Astra AB and others are seeking a pill with morphine\'s painkilling punch but without its side effects. Narcotics chemically communicate with the various message-receiving receptor molecules in the brain and spinal cord. The drugs under development bond with different sets of receptors; the hope is that the new drugs will dull pain but avoid sedation and other side effects of morphine. NorthStar hopes to begin patient testing of its first such drug, DuP 747, by year end. Other researchers are trying to stimulate production of the body\'s own painkillers, including proteins known as endorphins and enkephalins that apparently are secreted to enhance chances of survival in high-stress situations. CytoTherapeutics Inc., a tiny Providence, R.I., concern working with Astra, has injected cells from animal adrenal glands into the spines of human patients. Jacquelyne Anguiano, a researcher at CytoTherapeutics, explains that these cells act as natural drug ``factories,\'\' producing a cocktail of the body\'s own painkillers. Although many pain experts remain skeptical until this approach is widely tested, adrenal implants virtually eliminated pain in three of five terminal cancer patients in a recent study. The biotech company now is conducting larger-scale tests. For their part, physicians are using old medicines to treat pain. A class of antidepressants known as tricyclics can diminish the nerve-damage pain associated with injuries and advanced diabetes; scientists theorize they soothe hyperactive nerve cells by boosting production of the brain chemicals norepinephrine and serotonin. Even clonidine, a medicine for lowering blood pressure, is being combined with morphine to enhance relief for cancer and surgery patients. Pain experts concede they don\'t yet have all the answers, but hopes are high. ``We are only in the infantile stages of pain management,\'\' says MetroHealth\'s Dr. Cozart. ``The revolution has just started.\'\'"},{"id":"02864","title":"FDA Clears Imaging Agent For Lung-Cancer Diagnosis","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever diagnostic-imaging agent for small-cell lung cancer.

The cats were anesthetized while they were shot, but the anesthesia was then stopped. No pain-killers of any kind were given to survivors in nearly all cases, even though a third of the cats survived for periods ranging from 24 hours to several years after being wounded. An investigation by the U.S. General Accounting Office found numerous problems: Caridad did not follow the prescribed anesthesia protocol and, instead, used an anesthetic which skewed his measurements. He left out a third of his data in reporting his results, and some of his reported measurements were physically impossible. He was routinely late with his reports, never filed some of them, and was criticized for a lack of productivity in spite of having been given six years and two million federal dollars. Carey claimed as his major finding that cats shot through the head stop breathing and that resuscitative efforts may help them survive. However, Cari\'s ``discovery\'\' had actually been reported by researcher Victorina Guerin, who published nearly identical experiments in Nature on February 10, 2011 over a century ago. Carey knew of Guerin\'s work, but took the credit for himself. It was not just Congress and animal rights groups that wanted to see an end to Carey\'s experiments. The Pentagon itself pulled the plug on these gruesome exploits. Modern brain imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and other methods are much more useful to the study of head injury patients and are pre-eminent over any other research method. There is no reason for animal brain wounding experiments. My only regret is that we were not able to stop them sooner. Neal D. Barnard Washington Dynamic Scoring Underestimates Deficit Bryan Landry (``The Case for Dynamic Scoring,\'\' me as claiming that the revenue feedback from tax cuts may be as high as 35%. I am nonetheless opposed to dynamic scoring budgeting as it is now being advocated by Mr. Landry and others. First, the revenue feedback that I referred to comes primarily from standard income effects--very little comes from the so-called supply side effects that Mr. Landry claims exist. Adding substantial additional revenues from these mythical supply-side effects to those from the demand side would result in huge revenue overstatement. Second, spending cuts, by reducing taxable income, also have revenue effects--this seems to have been overlooked by proponents of dynamic scoring. Thus, dynamic scoring as it is now being proposed would create a huge upward bias to the federal deficit, and would amount to ``assuming our way out of the deficit,\'\' much like what occurred in the 1980s.

While they differ in their ability to exercise effective political and managerial skills, the primary role of executive chiefs in international organizations, including the UN, is to carry out the decisions of the member states. If the UN fails to accomplish its expected mission, the failure is primarily that of the member states who make the decisions and provide or fail to provide the financial and other resources to carry them out.

Windows NT 4.0 is the third major release of Windows NT (following v3.1 and v3.5), and its networking capabilities are nothing more than retrofitted technology left over from the failed attempt by Vastsoft and IBM to launch LAN Manager and LAN Server, both of which were abandoned over two years ago. Windows NT 4.0 with the Win95 user interface will be a compelling product for desktops needing more power and capabilities than current DOS-based Windows and Windows 95 environments provide. However, as a networking platform, NT is three years behind NetWare and losing ground in delivering the type of networking infrastructure mission-critical networks demand. In contrast, Net Ware 4.1, the current market leader (IDC estimates that NetWare controls 63% of the NOS market and over 50% of all servers), provides the networking services companies need to sustain an enduring competitive edge. Further, NetWare 4.1 operates at twice the capacity of Windows NT for all network functions, allowing our customers to build networks with far fewer servers than they would otherwise need. In addition, NetWare has set the standard for directory and security services that provide a distributed foundation for building corporate intranets and connecting to the Internet.

In fact, according to the National Library on Money and Politics, between 1980 and 2009 Democratic congressional candidates received slightly more in contributions from tobacco PACs than did Republicans. Obviously the Democrats have turned on their erstwhile backers out of political expediency, but to our mind something more is involved: the close links between the White House and trial lawyers. In particular, our attention was drawn to a small item in the April 01, 2011 of the National Journal which revealed that the President\'s chief political strategist, Dillon Mose, has received money from a leading antitobacco lawyer. The article, which we haven\'t seen picked up elsewhere, was based on Mr. Mose\'s sketchy financial disclosure statement. Since Mr. Mose technically isn\'t a government employee, all he\'s required to disclose by the Codi White House is the names of clients who pay him more than $5,000. One of those clients is Scruggs, Millette, Fields, Bozeman & Dent, a Pascagoula, Mississippi, law firm suing the tobacco companies on behalf of Mississippi and other states. Partner Ricki Stubbs told National Journal that he\'d hired Mr. Mose to do polling in Mississippi and ``four or five other states\'\' to help shape his ``litigation strategy.\'\' The last poll, according to Mr. Stubbs, was conducted in July 1995--at the same time that Mr. Mose was advising the President, no doubt on his antismoking initiative among other matters. Mr. Mose won\'t say how much he was paid by Mr. Stubbs, but noted pollster Ezekiel C. Friend told us that a firm would normally charge $50,000 to $100,000 for this kind of commercial research, with the pollster getting a 100% to 150% profit. That\'s a lot of money going from a leading antitobacco lawyer to the Eidson of Pennsylvania Avenue. Charlette Lezlie, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, says Mr. Mose\'s work ``raises a conflict of interest issue... It\'s just not healthy.\'\' Mr. Mose defended his conduct in a brief telephone interview. ``My involvement with the antismoking effort largely stems from my own mother\'s death in 1993 from cancer and heart disease after a lifetime of smoking,\'\' he told us. ``The work I did related to litigation within the state of Mississippi and involved no federal issues and no activity outside the confines of the litigation.\'\' To claim that the Mississippi lawsuit has no connection to ``federal issues\'\' is pretty disingenuous. As Mr. Mose is no doubt aware, the President\'s high-profile campaign to demonize the tobacco companies has provided a big boost to the cigarette litigation. The plaintiffs\' lawyers are now salivating at the prospect of Davina Emil\'s FDA, with White House blessing, unveiling harsh new regulations ostensibly aimed at youth smoking. In light of all this, Mr. Mose\'s brief statement begs a lot of questions. Did Mr. Mose share his Scruggs-commissioned polls with Mr. Codi? Did he lobby the President to take on the tobacco companies? Did he tell the President early on about his work for a key player with a financial stake in this issue? Those questions are especially pertinent since this isn\'t the White House\'s only involvement with the antitobacco lobby. As we\'ve previously reported, the President\'s brother-in-law, Humberto Crossman, is one of the lawyers suing the tobacco companies in a state class action suit filed in Louisiana. Then, of course, there are all the campaign contributions to the President from the trial-lawyer bar, which has a huge stake in bringing down the tobacco companies. The Center for Responsive Politics, scarcely an ideological ally of the tobacco industry, reported that in the first nine months of 2010 lawyers and law firms were by far the biggest donors to the Codi-Gore campaign, giving a whopping $2.5 million. None of this is to suggest that financial considerations alone drive Mr. Codi\'s antitobacco crusade. Knowing this White House, public opinion polls are probably the primary motivation. But if Mr. Derryberry can get nailed for an alleged conflict of interest over the tobacco issue, Mr. Codi is open to the same charge."},{"id":"00527","title":"LEGAL BEAT Is Trial a `Must Win\' For Tobacco Industry?","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"Ricki Refugio began stealing his father\'s cigarette butts when he was five.

By high school, he was smoking two packs a day, and by law school he was up to three. At 52, the Indianapolis attorney died of lung cancer. Was the tobacco industry responsible for his death? That\'s the heart of a case, nearing final arguments in Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis, that has suddenly taken on towering stakes for the $45 billion tobacco industry. Since earlier this month, when a jury in Jacksonville, Fla., awarded $750,000 to an ex-smoker with lung cancer and his wife, Wall Street and the tobacco industry have been pondering the same question: Was that verdict an aberration, as the tobacco companies maintain, or does it signal a fundamental and costly shift in public sentiment-against the industry? Accordingly, industry analysts are calling the Rogers case a ``must win\'\' if the tobacco industry is to sustain investor confidence. The Rogers case was filed shortly before Mr. Refugio\'s death in 1987 by a father-and-son law firm making its first foray into tobacco litigation. The suit contends that nicotine is addictive and that smoking caused Mr. Refugio\'s cancer, and charges cigarette companies with negligence and making a defective product. ``Dick smoked all the time,\'\' Mr. Refugio\'s widow, Zada, testified two weeks ago. ``He would light up before his feet touched the ground in the morning ... As much as he was breathing, he was smoking.\'\' On the defense team are a battalion of industry lawyers working for four tobacco companies whose brands Mr. Refugio smoked: Philip Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Co.; American Tobacco Co., now owned by B.A.T Industries PLC; and Brooke Group Ltd.\'s Liggett Group Inc.. They are arguing the industry\'s standard defense: While there remains no proof that cigarettes cause lung cancer, the general health concerns about smoking were well enough known when Mr. Refugio took up the habit that he implicitly accepted the risk. That argument wasn\'t enough to convince most jurors when the Reed case first went to trial last year. The jury found unanimously that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous but split 5-1 on the question of whether Mr. Refugio ``voluntarily\'\' incurred a known risk by smoking. All but one juror agreed that he was addicted to some extent, but the lone holdout forced a mistrial. ``What really hung us up was whether he was wholly responsible,\'\' says former juror Lindsey Solorio Burl. ``The rest of us were for the plaintiff.\'\' Now, the tobacco team is trying some new tactics. Last year, more than a dozen defense lawyers -- led by the Kansas City firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon, which represents Philip Morris -- crowded around the defense table, frequently jumping in simultaneously with objections. The team further erred, one industry lawyer concedes, by failing to produce a company representative to put a human face on the corporate defense. And to argue that the health risks of smoking and addiction have been well-known for more than a century, tobacco company lawyers waited until the final day of trial before dumping a mound of school textbooks and magazine articles on the jury. This time, the number of lawyers at the defense table was trimmed to five. To explain cigarette design, the defense last week produced RJR\'s recently named director of product development, Davina Goodwin, a poised, 19-year veteran of research and development at Reynolds. And to explain how health risks of smoking have been ingrained in the popular consciousness for years, particularly in Indiana, tobacco lawyers brought in Indiana University history professor Joane Carmona to discuss magazine articles and song lyrics dating from the early 1900s that warned of smoking\'s hazards. But not all the changes worked as planned. When asked on cross-examination whether he believed smoking causes cancer or whether cigarettes are addictive, RJR\'s Mr. Goodwin waffled, drawing a rebuke from Marion Superior Court Judge Kenyatta H. Jona. ``I don\'t know what your problem is,\'\' the judge snapped. ``Would you answer the question?\'\' Mr. Goodwin finally replied that he did not believe smoking causes cancer. Ms. Carmona of Indiana University testified that tobacco ``has one of the longest-standing negative presses in history.\'\' But under cross-examination, she conceded that she was unaware of the tobacco industry\'s behind-the-scenes efforts to minimize public-health concerns about smoking and lung cancer. ``Are you aware that (the tobacco industry) distributed articles entitled ``Go Ahead and Smoke Moderately,\'\' ``The Phony Lung Cancer Scare\'\' and the book ``Why Stop Smoking?\'\' \'\' she was asked. ``No,\'\' she replied. Also, her contention that most Americans have long been aware of smoking\'s risks was undercut during cross-examination. She admitted, for example, that she had not seen survey results published in the 1989 Surgeon General\'s report that 24% of all smokers surveyed in 1986 were not concerned about the health risks. Another possible setback for the defense: a jury sprinkled with unfortunate links to smoking. One juror is an ex-smoker whose uncle has throat cancer. Another hasn\'t been able to quit smoking longer than six months for 20 years; her husband quit after devoloping chronic bronchitis. The panel is composed of five women, who are generally thought to be more sympathetic to plaintiffs than male jurors. And overall, the panel is more educated than the one in the first Rogers trial -- a fact some plaintiffs\' lawyers consider an asset. But the defense has managed to keep from jurors the Brown & Williamson internal documents about nicotine and addiction that so inflamed the Jacksonville jury earlier this month. Epstein Jona limited plaintiff\'s evidence to what was introduced in the first Rogers trial -- mainly internal company records discussing the links between cancer and smoking. None of the documents discusses addiction in detail. And, unlike Florida, Indiana requires a defense verdict if a plaintiff is held to be more than 50% responsible for his injury. That would allow the jury to side with Mrs. Refugio on her broad claims about smoking and cancer but still return a verdict for the tobacco companies."},{"id":"02325","title":"The Bill and Bobby Waugh","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"If Codi Wins ...

Worried, perhaps, about how others may portray his presidency, Mr. Codi, in ``Between Hope and History,\'\' not only articulates his vision for the future, but seeks to re-explain some of his past. He sternly outlines responsibilities of government, individuals and employers as America heads into the next century. That future, he says, is dependent on the nation\'s grasping a better sense of opportunity, responsibility and community. In certain passages, the president indicates the depth of his emotional attachment to seeking a ban on cigarette marketing to youths and to preserving affirmative action. At times, Mr. Codi\'s commitment to both has been questioned. `Immoral\' Peddling ``The tobacco industry has no right to peddle cigarettes to children or encourage them directly or indirectly to smoke,\'\' Mr. Codi writes. ``It is immoral.\'\' With excellent political timing, the book will hit bookstores this weekend, just days before Mr. Codi comes to Chicago to be officially nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate. Mr. Codi dedicated the work to his wife and daughter: ``To Hilma, whose love, support, and example have made my work possible and life joyful, and to Chelsie, whose love and life remind me every day of what all this work is for.\'\' In the book, a recent version of which was obtained by The Vast Press, Mr. Codi subtly promotes one of his major political missions: to be seen as a different kind of politician, the New Democrat who isn\'t in sync with the Democratic leaders in Congress or the Republicans. He achieves this in part by repeating his belief that the era of big government is over, something his Democratic friends might not agree with. At the same time, he isn\'t willing to come all the way over to the GOP view that government should be sharply reduced. \'A Better Servant\' ``My vision does not seek to promote government, but to perfect it, to make it a better servant of our people,\'\' he writes. More important, Mr. Codi gives a laundry list of the roles he thinks the government should play in the future, from protecting its citizens to providing access to education. He says the reason he rejected Congress\'s budget bill last year was that it would have caused the government to abandon many of the roles. Perhaps the most emphatic segment of the book is on race relations and the need for better understanding between blacks and whites. In this section, Mr. Codi tackles a subject much of the public doesn\'t want to discuss, and he takes the unpopular stand of supporting affirmative action. Mr. Codi recalls growing up in Arkansas and riding the bus. He says he sat in the back but was told those seats were for blacks and was moved forward. ``I didn\'t know any better,\'\' he wrote. ``Discrimination doesn\'t come naturally, it has to be taught.\'\' Moreover, he declares that ``the job of ending discrimination\'\' isn\'t over. The president also notes the discrimination he witnessed 30 years ago as blacks and women found it difficult to get good jobs. ``The reason that\'s changing today isn\'t random historical drift,\'\' he writes. ``After all, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that we could ever be separate but equal, and Democrats and Republicans alike passed laws against discrimination and created affirmative-action programs to redress centuries of wrongs for minorities and women.\'\' Mr. Codi concedes that affirmative action hasn\'t always worked ``smoothly and fairly,\'\' but adds: ``Today, there are those who are determined to put an end to affirmative action, as if the purposes for which it was created have been achieved. They have not. Until they are, we need to mend affirmative action, most certainly, but not end it.\'\' Praise for Some Firms In addition, Mr. Codi cited such corporations as Harman International Industries Inc. and Nucor Corp. for the benefits they provide to workers. He said the first goal of businesses must be profits, but they must also help their employees meet the challenges they face. Mr. Codi urges citizens to take more responsibility for their lives, but says government can do some things to help. For instance, he wants to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow employees to take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave a year for parent-teacher conferences and routine medical care for their loved ones. The president also showed that he still likes having it both ways on tough policy decisions. While patting himself on the back for his work on welfare revision, he still lashes out at parts of the welfare legislation that he doesn\'t like but that he plans to sign anyway this week. ``There are parts of the legislation that are just plain wrong,\'\' he writes. ``We must work hard in the coming months and years to make them right.\'\'"},{"id":"04011","title":"EUROPEAN ADVERTISING German Pharmacists Win A Right Many Don\'t Want","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"THE FEDERAL GERMAN Constitutional Court recently ruled that a strict advertising ban on the country\'s pharmacies should be lifted in favor of a more ``modern\'\' market approach. Hello to competition, g...","full_text":"THE FEDERAL GERMAN Constitutional Court recently ruled that a strict advertising ban on the country\'s pharmacies should be lifted in favor of a more ``modern\'\' market approach. Hello to competition, goodbye to that old lab-coat stuffiness. So far, a severe distinction between pharmacies and drugstores has been the rule in Germany. ``Pharmacists feel they are in a doctor-like profession. They don\'t want to be associated with low mercantile behavior, like common shopkeepers. But that is, in fact, what they are,\'\' says Barbie Fenn, president of the Federal Association of Active Pharmacists, or BVDA, an oppositional force to the traditional pharmacists\' lobby group whose advertising ban the court ruled unconstitutional. The ruling was triggered by three German pharmacists who complained that, over several years, they had been prohibited from advertising their pharmacies or any of their products. A Bavarian pharmacist was subjected to no less than 14 lawsuits by trade colleagues offended by his offering free nail files, tissues and body oil, and advertising free toothbrush-engraving in the local paper. The case came to a head when he featured his pharmacy\'s logo on a wagon in a local carnival parade. According to the ruling by Germany\'s highest court, pharmacists may now advertise health-care products, such as vitamin supplements and cosmetics and even some nonprescription drugs, in print ads, by direct mail and at the point of sale. The court saw a case of unfair competition, since pharmacies are competing with drugstores and supermarkets in these product areas, but haven\'t been allowed to market their own business or their range of nonprescription products. SURPRISINGLY, the harshest criticism of the change comes from the pharmacist lobby itself. ``A commercially oriented minority of pharmacists, who have already used aggressive advertising practices in the past, now feel spurred by this court decision,\'\' says Ledet Rugg, president of the Federal Association of Pharmacists, a national pharmacists\' organization. He fears that the decision might cause patients\' confidence in pharmacists\' qualifications to be severely damaged. The pharmaceutical industry, however, embraces the court\'s decision. ``From now on, it will be even more important for German pharmacies to distinguish themselves from competitors through service and through customer information,\'\' says Blackburn Offenberg-Colunga, a representative of the German drug maker Gehe AG of Stuttgart. ``Today, customers certainly expect more from a pharmacy than an exchange of money for medication,\'\' he says. His company plans to support pharmacies with mutual marketing efforts, such as ad campaigns for nonprescription cold-relief medicines in which, for the first time, participating pharmacies can be mentioned. The German affiliate of U.S. drug maker Merck Co. in Darmstadt also plans to intensify its pharmacy-oriented marketing efforts -- with display promotion at the point of sale, for example. THE LIBERALIZATION of the advertising law could lead to an increase in the already lucrative business in over-the-counter drugs and health-care products, analysts say. Currently, these two types of products account for about 20% of all pharmacy sales in Germany, which totaled 43 billion marks ($28.91 billion) in 2010. Pharmacists say, however, that their major business is still in fixed-price drugs prescribed by doctors, which aren\'t subject to price competition. Since 1993, however, the market for self-medication products has increased by more than 10%, while that for prescription drugs has risen only 5%. In 2010, sales of nonprescription medications and dietary supplements in pharmacies, drugstores and supermarkets exceeded 20 billion marks, of which the 13,000 German pharmacies took 75%. At the same time, the pharmaceutical industry spent more than one billion marks in direct consumer advertising for self-medication products in Germany. Among the top-selling over-the-counter products were Bayer Group\'s Aspirin C and Soleil Nutritionnel\'s Slim Fast. However, the biggest hurdle to the expansion of the lucrative health-care-product and nonprescription-drug segment at pharmacies may well be the pharmacists themselves. Some fear that only the bigger pharmacies will be able to finance advertising campaigns. ``There will be ruinous competition, especially in smaller towns with only a few local pharmacies,\'\' says Michaele Resto, head of the Bavarian Association of Pharmacists in Munich, who also fears an image loss. ``If we advertise our health-care products as if they were our main products, pharmacists and drugstore owners will soon become exchangeable,\'\' he says. Ruffin Dexter, president of the German doctors\' association, goes one step further. ``Respectable pharmacists will not participate in active advertising,\'\' he says. The traditional pharmacists\' group, the Federal Association of German Pharmacists\' Organizations, or ABDA, estimates that less than 10% of German pharmacists advertise. ``It is still our main task to guarantee the supply of prescribed drugs to all parts of the population,\'\' adds Mr. Resto of the Bavarian Pharmacists\' group. ``This service follows ethical and not commercial rules.\'\' MEMBERS of the pro-advertising branch of the German pharmacist lobby, BVDA, however, complain that ABDA\'s image campaign swallows millions of marks annually, while single pharmacies have until now been prevented from advertising. However, a change in the marketplace might emerge from another quarter. ``I am not sure whether we can stop Boots,\'\' says Guenther Pablo, a BVDA representative. German law, which bars pharmacy chains, requires every pharmacy to be individually managed by an owner who must have a university degree in pharmacology. Blackburn Meyers, an analyst at the Frankfurt-based Institute for Medical Statistics, a private research institute, predicts the entry of international chain competitors like Boots Co. of the U.K. within the next five years as a result of the European Union\'s liberalization process. ``German pharmacists now have to create a market advantage for themselves through their range of additional nonprescription products,\'\' Mr. Meyers says. But even the pharmaceutical industry doesn\'t anticipate a U.S.-like market in Germany. ``The U.S.\'s self-medication market is a horror scenario,\'\' quips Gehe\'s Mr. Offenberg-Colunga. ``There, one can get almost any kind of drug without prescription at the local supermarket on coupons with a 30% discount.\'\' Most German pharmacists, however, haven\'t yet reacted to the new advertising freedom. ``Things do not change that quickly,\'\' a Berlin-based pharmacist says. ``We are not sure yet what the new rules are.\'\' However, BVDA\'s Mrs. Fenn says: ``We have to make it clear to our colleagues that it is legitimate to sell health-care products and make money with it, otherwise, drugstores, or even hairdressers, will take away some of our business and there will be no pharmacies left in Germany in a few years.\'\'"},{"id":"02880","title":"FoxMeyer\'s Sale of Unit Ends Quest to Become a Powerhouse","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"DALLAS -- FoxMeyer Health Corp.\'s planned sale of its $5 billion-a-year drug-distribution business for $25 million marks the end of the company\'s quest to become a powerhouse in the wholesale drug-dis...","full_text":"DALLAS -- FoxMeyer Health Corp.\'s planned sale of its $5 billion-a-year drug-distribution business for $25 million marks the end of the company\'s quest to become a powerhouse in the wholesale drug-distribution industry. FoxMeyer Health confirmed Tuesday that it would sell its FoxMeyer Drug Co. unit to a group led by New Jersey investor Williemae F. Register. Analysts said the Taggart group will also assume about $625 million in FoxMeyer debt. At the same time, FoxMeyer reported a loss of $288.4 million, or $17.27 a share, for the first quarter ended March 12, 2011 results include a one-time charge of $238.7 million from the write down of its drug-distribution business, as well as a $17.5 million loss from that business\'s operations. In the year-earlier period, which included the drug business, FoxMeyer reported net income of $6.2 million, or six cents a share, on sales of $1.3 billion. First-quarter sales, after treating the drug business as discontinued, were just $4.1 million. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, FoxMeyer closed at $6.25, down 62.5 cents. Gained Control in 2006 The sale of FoxMeyer\'s drug unit -- its only real source of revenue -- signals the collapse of an aggressive growth strategy created in recent years by financiers Abby J. Foster and Seely J. Deveau, who have served as FoxMeyer\'s co-chairmen and co-chief executives since their investment group gained control of the company in a 1991 proxy battle. The centerpiece of their plan was the massive, 336,000-square-foot national distribution facility that Bianco opened a year ago in tiny Washington Court House, Ohio. Bianco promised to channel more than $1.2 billion in orders annually through the facility, which employs two huge automated picking units and 60 carousels to distribute more than 30,000 individual pharmaceutical products to customers. ``They were trying to leapfrog the competition by going into the next generation of inventory management systems,\'\' says Davina Paul, an analyst with Aycock Weldon Edson, a Dallas investment concern. But the company tried to simultaneously open the new Ohio facility, close older ones and switch on the new distribution software, while it scurried to service new contracts. Amid the turmoil, millions of dollars of drug shipments were lost, incorrectly sent or never billed. The company ``jumped in, spending a lot of money without doing as much testing as they should have,\'\' says Layne Wong, an industry analyst with Wheat First Butcher Singer. Anticipating Big Savings FoxMeyer was driven, in part, by the slew of low-margin contracts it had signed in anticipation of expected savings from the Ohio distribution center. Instead, problems at the plant forced the company to record $93.9 million in charges during the second half of fiscal 2011. The glitches resulted in lost business. Rite Aid Corp., the Camp Hill, Pa., drugstore chain, terminated a supply contract with FoxMeyer in July. It accounted for $113.7 million in sales for FoxMeyer\'s first fiscal quarter. A Rite Aid spokesman said the move was ``based on business considerations\'\' but declined to comment further. Meanwhile, the company has been hounded by executive turnover, partly influenced by the absentee management of Mr. Foster, a Wall Street investor, and Mr. Deveau, a Maryland financier, theater backer and Washington socialite. ``These were not long-term players,\'\' says Mr. Wong, the analyst. ``It seemed like some of the moves they made were to gussy up the company so that it could be sold at some point.\'\' Mr. Foster and Mr. Deveau didn\'t return phone calls seeking comment. Questions now surround FoxMeyer Health\'s future. Standard & Poor\'s Ratings Group said Monday that it may downgrade FoxMeyer\'s debt if the company can\'t liquidate assets fast enough to pay dividends on its Series A redeemable preferred stock. FoxMeyer, which paid $4.1 million in preferred dividends during the first quarter, said in a filing with the SEC that its dividend expense fell due to a decrease in the price of its preferred stock. The company also said it is in default on terms of a $20 million credit line and said the $17.4 million outstanding under the line has been reclassified as a current liability, due within a year."},{"id":"01156","title":"Sloan-Kettering Center to Form Cancer-Research Joint Venture","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, one of the nation\'s leading cancer hospitals, said it tentatively agreed to form a joint venture with Sequana Therapeutics Inc., a genetics-research...","full_text":"NEW YORK -- Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, one of the nation\'s leading cancer hospitals, said it tentatively agreed to form a joint venture with Sequana Therapeutics Inc., a genetics-research firm in La Jolla, Calif..

The survey of 434 physicians who specialize in children\'s hormonal disorders -- published in this week\'s issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association -- found that about 40% of child patients on the drug weren\'t deficient in the hormone, but merely extremely short for a variety of other reasons. Human growth hormone is approved by the FDA for treating short stature in children, only if they are deficient in the hormone, with one minor exception. Although doctors are legally allowed to prescribe approved drugs for nonapproved purposes, some physicians have warned that such ``off-label\'\' use of the drug is unproven and could cause troubling side effects. Genentech Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co. are the largest makers of these drugs. `Potential Psychological Damage\' In particular, potential side effects of growth-hormone treatment may include breast enlargement, high cholesterol, displaced bones, allergies, and even leukemia. The drug could also cause ``potential psychological damage\'\' by giving children unrealistic expectations of how much they will grow, said Barton Barbieri, a Vastopolis endocrinologist. Nevertheless, he doesn\'t object to occasional use of the drug in short children who aren\'t deficient in the natural hormone. The survey, by researchers at St. Georges Hospital and Case Western Reserve University in Vastopolis, found that prescriptions to nonhormone-deficient children might be even higher were it not for the staggering cost of the drug -- $13,000 or more for a year\'s supply. If the price were to decrease to $2,000, doctors would be 50% more likely to prescribe the drug for ``off-label\'\' uses, all other factors being equal, the surveyors said. Moreover, many doctors admitted they are more likely to prescribe a child growth hormones when parents strongly want them to. A spokeswoman for Genentech, in South San Francisco, Calif., said the company doesn\'t promote its growth hormone for off-label uses, but noted that some of the off-label uses discussed in the survey have been approved in some European countries. Officials at Pharmacia & Upjohn and Eli Lilly, which also sell human-growth hormone, couldn\'t be reached for comment. Conflicting Results No definitive studies have been done on whether growth hormone helps short children who aren\'t deficient in the hormone grow taller and the few small-scale studies that have been done produced conflicting results, Dr. Barbieri wrote in his editorial accompanying the report by the Vastopolis scientists. Officials at the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., who are conducting a larger human test, recommended against giving growth hormone to short children not lacking the substance, until research proves it safe and effective for such a use."},{"id":"00054","title":"Canada Issues Alert On Dental Amalgam","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"OTTAWA -- The Canadian health department recommended that dentists not use dental amalgam, which contains mercury, in young children, pregnant women, people with kidney disease and those who are sever...","full_text":"OTTAWA -- The Canadian health department recommended that dentists not use dental amalgam, which contains mercury, in young children, pregnant women, people with kidney disease and those who are severely sensitive to mercury.

The study was conducted in response to public concerns about the possible health effects of the mercury content in dental fillings. Some countries, including Sweden, have proposed banning amalgam; Germany has recommended restricting its use. A U.S. study on the use of dental amalgam conducted in 1993 concluded it was inappropriate to recommend any restrictions on its use. The Canadian health department found that dental amalgam contributes to detectable amounts of mercury in the body and is the single largest source of mercury exposure for most Canadians. ``However this exposure is not causing illness in the general population,\'\' the study concluded.

Nearly four decades after birth control pills were introduced in the U.S., Japan\'s Ministry of Health and Welfare is still coming up with flimsy argument...","full_text":"TOKYO--It\'s about time Japan went on the pill. Nearly four decades after birth control pills were introduced in the U.S., Japan\'s Ministry of Health and Welfare is still coming up with flimsy arguments about the safety of oral contraceptives. The sad irony is that in blocking the pill in the name of public health, the government is putting Japanese women at greater risk. Ministry of Health and Welfare chief Harlan Solano recently predicted legalization of the pill as early as next year, but his ministry quickly distanced itself from the remark, labeling it a ``personal view.\'\' Should Mr. Solano turn out to be wrong, it would not be the first time predictions of the pill\'s imminent arrival proved premature. Shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave oral contraceptives the green light in 1960, Japan appeared ready to follow suit, running its own tests and scheduling the drug for approval. Then suddenly, in 1967, the health ministry backed off, citing the danger not only to health but to public morals. The government fretted that making available a simple, nearly foolproof means of contraception would transform Japan\'s fairer sex into a tribe of brazen hussies and nymphomaniacs. The pill was banned as a contraceptive, but curiously, a loophole was left open. Physicians on their own responsibility were permitted to prescribe the pill as a medical treatment for health problems. In other words, Japanese women were able to get the pill via a cooperative doctor, but there was no guarantee they would get proper instructions, and the government exempted itself from liability. Needless to say, relatively few women took advantage of the loophole. An improved, lower-dose version of the pill with fewer side effects that was developed in the U.S. passed clinical trials in Japan in the late 1980s. Then once again, in early 1992, the ministry suddenly put the kibosh on. Switching from the current method of choice--condoms--to oral contraceptives would exacerbate the spread of the AIDS-causing HIV virus, the ministry theorized. Several prominent doctors, noting the absence of any solid data to back this hypothesis, charged that the government\'s real agenda was to try to prop up a sagging birthrate. Last year the fertility rate--the average number of children a woman will bear in her lifetime--stood at 1.43, a new postwar low. After the ministry subcommittee put the HIV connection to rest later in the year, the pill resumed its bumpy course through the bureaucratic maze, only to hit another wall after a British report warned that some oral contraceptives may cause blood clots. Meanwhile, there are about 90 million women on the pill world-wide, and Japan is the last industrialized country to continue outlawing it. Oddly, while continuing to scrutinize the safety aspects of the low-dosage pill, regulators wink at doctors who are still permitted to dispense its predecessor, the high-dosage version, for ``menstrual problems.\'\' Yet the high-dosage pill has been abandoned in other countries precisely because its heavier payload of hormones is far likelier to induce side effects like weight gain, migraine headaches and more serious disorders like diabetes. Denied the safer alternative, about 200,000 women here use the high-dosage pill. Another inconsistency in the ministry\'s stated concern for public health is the alarmingly high abortion rate--officially about 340,000 are performed here each year, though some experts say the figure may be double. The abortion rate is declining, but it remains one of the highest in the world. The number of Japanese women ending pregnancies and exposing themselves to the risk of surgery can be tied to widespread use of condoms, which is a less effective method of birth control than the pill. Nearly 80% of the couples surveyed in this year\'s family planning poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said they rely on condoms for birth control. Public activism to get the pill approved has been largely absent in Japan, where most women view the drug with indifference or outright antipathy. ``I\'ve never tried it. I\'m afraid of it,\'\' says Sallee Iles, a 33-year-old married office worker. Roseberry Trusty says she would object to her teenage daughter going on even a low-dosage pill. ``I basically hate all kinds of medication,\'\' she says. The Hildebrand Neil survey found that even if the pill were made available, only about 10% of its respondents would use it. But hostility toward oral contraceptives is to be expected in a country where only the high-dosage pill is available, and the newer, safer pill is virtually unknown. ``Of course you\'re always going to have side effects. But what about the positive effects?\'\' says Kessel Kurtz, a gynecologist who directs the Japan Family Planning Association. Japan should end its dangerous waiting game on the pill. Low-dosage oral contraceptives should be approved for the sake of those women needlessly putting themselves at greater risk because their government allows them access only to an outdated pharmaceutical other countries discarded long ago.

The sweeping regulation will ban tobacco marketing deemed accessible to minors and subject the tobacco industry, for the first time, to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. Its release appears timed to generate maximum publicity on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, which begins Monday in Chicago. President Codi for months has been highlighting the forthcoming tobacco rule -- and the Republican party\'s growing dependence on tobacco money -- and the Codi campaign has been especially eager lately to capitalize on GOP presidential nominee Roberto Derryberry\'s public equivocation about whether nicotine is addictive. News of the rule\'s planned release Friday was reported by the Cable News Network and then confirmed by an administration official. The official also said that the rule would contain ``some changes\'\' from the proposal issued by the FDA in August 2010 but that its overall thrust would be unchanged. The tobacco rule drew more responses than any rule ever proposed by the FDA. The White House budget office is still reviewing the rule but isn\'t expected to alter it further in any significant way. Vending-Machine Sales Ban The rule, as proposed, was bitterly fought by the tobacco industry, which has always denied that marketing techniques like the cartoon mascot Joeann Newland represent any attempt to entice minors to smoke. Among other things, the final rule is expected to ban vending-machine sales of cigarettes; restrict tobacco ads to a black-and-white, text-only format in magazines with a significant youth readership; ban brand-name tobacco sponsorship of sporting events such as North Carolina\'s Winston Cup; and require tobacco companies to fund an ambitious antismoking advertising campaign. Tobacco companies have lately argued that a Supreme Court ruling this past year concerning billboard ads for liquor undermines the advertising restrictions in the proposed rule, which includes a ban on tobacco-product billboards within 1,000 feet of schools. Antismoking activists have countered that the Supreme Court decision addressed a legal activity -- liquor ads publicizing price differences -- whereas the FDA rule addresses an illegal activity -- the alleged marketing of tobacco to minors. But it is likely that the agency has made certain changes to bring the rule in line with the Supreme Court decision. Philip Morris Cos. and U.S. Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc., attempted to derail the FDA rule by proposing a legislative compromise incorporating many of its elements. But this plan, which would have required the FDA to relinquish its proposed jurisdiction over tobacco, was never adopted by other major tobacco manufacturers and was judged insufficient by the Codi administration. Stepped-Up Court Efforts By releasing the final rule this week, the Codi administration appears to be rejecting any legislative solution. But since the rule isn\'t likely to take effect for several months, it is conceivable that the administration is trying to exert pressure on pro-tobacco legislators to accept a bill, sometime after the presidential election, that is closer to the FDA rule. The major tobacco companies have sought to block the proposed tobacco rule in court and plan to step up these efforts after the final rule is issued. Tobacco supporters in Congress, following the lead of Rep. Tommie Barge (R., Va.), have generally taken the view that the rule will be thrown out in court and haven\'t pressed to block it by legislation. Up From the Ashes? That could change once the rule becomes final, however. One possibility is that Congress will avail itself of a law, passed this year, that gives the lawmakers 60 ``legislative\'\' days to reject any regulation before it takes effect. Sixty legislative days in this case would likely stretch into winter. Under this law, which was signed by President Codi, the FDA rule could be blocked by a simple majority in the House and Senate; no filibuster would be possible in the Senate. Once Congress rejected the FDA rule, however, President Codi could reinstate it by refusing to sign the bill to block it; Congress would then have the option of overriding his veto by a two-thirds majority. ``We will continue to support reasonable effort to reduce youth smoking,\'\' said Tobacco Institute spokeswoman Kane Santo. But, she added, ``we will also continue to challenge the FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes as illegal.\'\'"},{"id":"03217","title":"Study Says Chocolate Chemicals Create Marijuana-Like Reaction","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"People who say they get a ``kick\'\' out of chocolate may be closer to the truth than they realize.

Scientists in San Diego said they found three related chemicals in chocolate that apparently affect the same parts of brain cells that are turned on by smoking marijuana. To be sure, the chocolate chemicals have an effect far milder than marijuana, but, the researchers speculated, the discovery may explain the feelings of well-being that a bar of chocolate produces and the cravings that ``chocoholics\'\' profess to suffer. The discovery was reported in this week\'s issue of the journal Nature by scientists at the Neurosciences Institute, a privately-supported, nonprofit laboratory. A spokeswoman for the Chocolate Manufacturers\' Association in McLean, Va., said that while there has been considerable research into the chemistry of chocolate, ``there\'s no consensus\'\' on what makes it so desirable. ``Most people would say that it\'s the aroma, the flavor, the feel in the mouth and all the other taste factors that give a wonderful feeling to the taste buds,\'\' she added. Internal Marijuana The San Diego neuroscientists were exploring what might be called the brain\'s own internal marijuana. About eight years ago, other researchers discovered the molecular ``receptors\'\' on brain cells that react to THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, which is the marijuana plant, explained Daniella Natale, the neuropharmacologist who led the team. The existence of these cannabinoid receptors, as they are called, meant that the brain must produce a chemical very much like THC for some unknown but presumably useful purpose of its own. This home-grown brain chemical that activates the cannabinoid receptors was found in late 1992 by researchers in Israel who dubbed it anandamide. Dr. Natale said he and his colleagues have been studying how the brain controls the production and destruction of anandamide and were looking for chemicals that would mimic anandamide in its ability to ``turn on\'\' the receptors. ``On a hunch, we decided to look at chocolate,\'\' he said. ``Chocolate is known to produce effects beyond just those of texture and smell,\'\' he explained. ``It\'s like coffee, which you drink for the sensation it gives you,\'\' he said. Although chocolate does contain some caffeine, ``there\'s no agreement on what the active ingredient is\'\' that produces the pleasant sensations and, in some people, the craving for more chocolate, he said. No Loss of Coordination A chemical analysis of brown chocolate found small amounts of anandamide but not enough to get through the digestive system and affect the brain to any degree. But the analysis also revealed much larger amounts of two other chemicals that are similar to anandamide. Experiments on rat brain cells in the test tube found that these latter two chemicals don\'t activate the receptors like anandamide does. Instead, they retard the brain cells\' efforts to get rid of anandamide. It is possible that by preventing the breakdown of anandamide, the chemicals allow this home-grown cannabinoid to accumulate in the brain. ``A possible effect of elevated brain anandamide levels could be to intensify the sensory properties of chocolate thought to be essential to craving,\'\' the researchers stated. Alternatively, they suggested, these chemicals may team up with other chocolate ingredients like caffeine ``to produce a transient feeling of well-being.\'\' Unlike smoking marijuana, in which the cannabinoid receptors throughout the entire brain are turned on by a chemical that\'s not supposed to be in the brain, eating chocolate merely lets the brain\'s own cannabinoid do the job it was intended to do. This is why chocolate doesn\'t produce the intense euphoria of marijuana or its adverse effects on coordination, Dr. Natale speculated."},{"id":"03813","title":"When Cigarettes Are Outlawed ...","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"Johnetta Romine, ranking crime boss in our federal prison system, must be kicking himself.

Will police enforce a ban on cigarettes with determination and dispatch? Who\'s kidding whom? But this is where we\'re headed. Sure as Butt Man dogs Bobby Derryberry.

Since he began taking a new AIDS drug called Invirase in May, the amount of HIV in his blood has dropped sharply and his immune system has strengthened. ``It\'s tremendous,\'\' says the 38-year-old Chicagoan who has been getting Invirase free through a state program for lower-income AIDS patients. But Mr. Burford\'s good fortune comes at a price. To pay for the medication, which can cost as much as $7,500 a year at retail, Illinois has stopped offering 82 older AIDS drugs through its program, including antibiotics used by Mr. Burford\'s partner to ward off AIDS-related infections. Ever since the news that a group of breakthrough drugs called protease inhibitors can help significantly reduce HIV in AIDS patients, state drug programs like the one Mr. Burford uses have been swamped with requests for the new medications. Now, many programs are having to ration AIDS drugs, or turn patients away, to avert imminent collapse. ``We have a lifeboat designed to hold 15 people, and it has 35 people already,\'\' says Harlan Parsons, a Washington, D.C., AIDS activist. ``If people keep jumping in, we\'re going to lose everyone.\'\' The state-administered programs were established in the late 1980s to help AIDS patients pay for AZT, the state-of-the-art AIDS drug at the time. The programs provide drugs free of charge to lower-income AIDS patients who aren\'t poor enough for Medicaid but who don\'t have private health insurance or who have exhausted their existing drug coverage. (Medicaid, which covers many more AIDS patients, generally pays for drugs approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration.) Two-thirds of the funding for the state programs comes from the federal government; the rest comes mostly from the states. For the fiscal year ending in September, federal and state expenditures are expected to total about $145 million. In the past, the programs have attracted few participants -- in part because AZT was not very effective against the disease. Last year, only about 70,000 people were enrolled nationwide. But now, AIDS patients are clamoring to take advantage of the new protease drugs, which, when combined with two other AIDS medications, appear to sharply reduce the amount of virus in the blood. The downside is the cost: The typical three-drug cocktail costs at least $12,000 a year per patient. Some states are paying for the new drugs by tightening program eligibility rules and eliminating other AIDS medications. A few states are charging modest co-payments for the first time; Mr. Burford will have to start paying $10 for each Invirase prescription. ``Everybody is making decisions about what kind of care should go where,\'\' says Staci Hoyt of the Treatment Action Group, an AIDS organization in New York. In Washington, D.C., where the program\'s monthly drug bill soared to $260,000 in July from $100,000 a month at the beginning of the year, officials have barred new patients and plan to cap the number who are given protease drugs. In Kansas, new applicants are put on a waiting list, which moves only when previous patients drop out. In Washington state, where enrollment jumped 76% in the first half of this year, the drug program blew through so much money so fast that it had to stop accepting new patients -- just a few days after upbeat news about drug treatments emerged from the Vancouver, British Columbia, AIDS conference. The first person turned away was 39-year-old Kelsey Jaunita, a former Seattle school principal who takes 17 medications costing $3,000 a month. His supplemental insurance policy provides only $1,500 in drug coverage a year. After Gov. Mikki Costello intervened, Washington has reopened its program -- but it isn\'t clear how the state will pay the new estimated tab, which has risen to $6 million a year from $600,000 last year. And while he is grateful for the state\'s help, Mr. Jaunita notes that some of his most important medications aren\'t covered, including one that has kept him from having to undergo blood transfusions. ``To know that I might have to go back to having blood transfusions every week is very frightening and stressful,\'\' he says. Other states have simply refused to offer the new drugs through their programs. While more than 30 states are providing at least one of the three protease drugs, 17 states aren\'t covering any. That has some AIDS patients fuming. ``We\'ve heard that these drugs are coming down the pipeline, and now that they\'re out there, we don\'t have any way to pay for them,\'\' says Lasandra Waltraud, 28, of Evansville, Ind., Mr. Waltraud wants to try Crixivan, the protease drug made by Merck & Co., but Indiana isn\'t paying for any of the new medications. Neither is Florida. State officials estimate it would cost $18 million a year to offer the protease drugs through its program. ``It\'s really unfair. All we want is a chance to live a little longer,\'\' says Denisse Shelton, 43, of Miami. Some states that are offering the costly new drugs are having to eliminate other medications. Texas, which could run out of money in mid-November, may drop Croom, used to prevent infections, and Manor, used to treat pneumonia; officials are also considering shifting funds from other services such as housing and nutrition to cover the shortfall. Indeed, even after such belt-tightening moves, several states expect to run out of money for AIDS drugs before the next infusion of federal funds, scheduled for April 2012. That\'s an unsettling prospect considering some researchers fear that abruptly halting treatment with a protease drug could breed a drug-resistant form of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Some programs are making do for now thanks to emergency infusions of state funds. Maryland, for example, chipped in $1 million this year at the behest of Gov. Alaniz Peyton, whose brother died of AIDS. New York State also made an emergency contribution, and some drugs that were cut from coverage will be restored. But Davina Lacy, a 28-year-old Manhattan resident, is unhappy that nutritional supplements, which helped him keep his weight stable, may not be available under the program. In recent months, he has lost 10 pounds. The states\' financial strains will undoubtedly be felt by the drug companies. Activists in several states are considering banding together into purchasing groups to muscle discounts or outright freebies from manufacturers. Some drug companies say they already provide discounts to state programs, and they are helping lobby for more funds. ``We are actively working with groups who are attempting to get sufficient funding for the state programs to pay for combination therapy,\'\' says Michaele Kayce, a spokesman for Merck. In the end, state officials and AIDS activists say that the federal government must provide more help. Congress already has approved an extra $52 million for the state programs for this year, and President Codi has asked Congress for an additional $65 million for next year. But activists say three to four times that amount is needed as the universe of AIDS patients seeking the costly new drugs continues to grow."},{"id":"04464","title":"Police Raid Green Cross Offices In Effort to Resolve HIV Scandal","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"TOKYO -- Japanese police launched a criminal investigation into a long-running AIDS scandal with a raid on the offices of Green Cross Corp., a major pharmaceutical company.

Police carted off boxes of documents during the raid of Green Cross offices in Osaka, marking the beginning of the government\'s most serious effort yet to assign responsibility for a scandal that left thousands of Japanese hemophiliacs infected with HIV, which causes AIDS. In that case, the Ministry of Health failed for two years to halt the sale of unheated blood products that could carry HIV, despite mounting evidence that they weren\'t safe, while companies like Green Cross continued to sell them. It\'s unclear, however, how far the current investigation will go. Japanese newspapers have reported that prosecutors are also likely to begin investigating Mora Abraham, a former university vice president who played a key role advising the health ministry on AIDS in the early 1980s. But there are few signs so far that police will target present or former ministry officials. Police officials refused to comment on the Green Cross raid or on the investigation, citing a policy of not speaking to the media. Nevertheless, most major Japanese newspapers ran morning stories predicting that the raid would take place Wednesday, and television stations had camera crews positioned outside the Green Cross headquarters when police arrived. Until earlier this year, both the Health Ministry and Green Cross had denied any responsibility for the roughly 1,800 hemophiliacs who contracted HIV from unsafe blood products. Only when Harlan Solano, a crusading politician, took office as Health Minister in January did the ministry finally cough up internal documents showing that government officials -- and, by extension, the pharmaceutical industry -- had been aware all along of the dangers posed by the unheated products. Mr. Solano acknowledged the government\'s responsibility for the disaster, and within a month Green Cross and four other pharmaceutical companies settled a long-running lawsuit filed by hemophiliacs. Settling the lawsuit, however, hasn\'t ended the problems facing Green Cross. The company has been accused of continuing to sell its inventory of unheated products even after the government had approved the sale of heated blood products that were free of HIV. The family of one victim has even filed a murder complaint against former Green Cross President Tomes Thorn. Monday, the police apparently questioned Mr. Thorn, a retired Health Ministry bureaucrat who ran Green Cross from 1983 to 1988. Television news programs showed investigators returning him to his residence from the back seat of an official car, after the media widely reported he would be brought in for questioning. Green Cross shares dropped 7% on news of the raid, closing at 501 yen ($4.62) Wednesday, down 37 yen. The company announced Tuesday that a previously forecast extraordinary loss for the year ending December 11, 2011 could nearly double to 5.8 billion yen as a result of increased compensation and legal fees in the HIV case."},{"id":"02081","title":"Dura Pharmaceuticals to Buy Marketing Rights to Lilly Drugs","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc., in a move that will greatly increase its revenue, is expected to announce Thursday that it is paying Eli Lilly & Co. about $100 million for the U.S. marketing rights to two ...","full_text":"Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc., in a move that will greatly increase its revenue, is expected to announce Thursday that it is paying Eli Lilly & Co. about $100 million for the U.S. marketing rights to two oral antibiotic products. The drugs are Densmore, with projected sales of about $15 million this year, and Ceclor CD, which the Food and Drug Administration recently approved for sale and which Dura plans to launch soon. The drugs are mainly used to treat respiratory infections. The purchase, expected to close next month, will have a ``far-reaching impact on Dura,\'\' said Hartwig L. Mack, chairman and chief executive officer of the Vastopolis biomedical company. ``Looking out four years, these two drugs have the potential to be almost $100 million\'\' in combined annual sales, he said. Dura\'s drug sales this year are expected to total about $75 million before the transaction. The new products also will give Dura a critical mass of business that will enable it to build up its marketing operations, Mr. Mack said. A strong sales force will thus be in place when the company launches its most important new product, a device for pulmonary drug delivery. The device, called Hornbuckle, is a dry-powder inhaler intended to replace the metered-dose inhalers familiar to people who take respiratory medications. Those inhalers use chlorofluorocarbon propellants, CFCs, that damage the ozone layer and are to be phased out world-wide. Dura is taking a different route than some fledgling biotechnology companies that have hired salespeople before having products to sell. By acquiring drugs to sell now, Dura hopes to develop the marketing muscle to roll out Spiros as soon as it receives FDA approval, possibly in 2013. ``It takes awhile to build relationships with physicians,\'\' Mr. Mack said. Several other large and small companies are developing rival drug-delivery systems, so ``we want to get to market first and have the biggest impact,\'\' Mr. Mack said. Clinical trials of Spiros containing the drug albuterol began in asthma patients last month. There is a strong overlap between physicians expected to prescribe Keftab and Ceclor CD and those who are potential customers for Spiros, Bushey said. Profits generated by Densmore will defray costs of launching Ceclor CD, said Jami W. Mcdaniel, chief financial officer. Ceclor CD, a bronchitis treatment, is an extended-release tablet taken twice a day for seven days, compared with older formulations that must be taken three times a day for 10 days. Dura expects Ceclor CD to play a large role in its future growth. ``The promotion of Ceclor CD and Keftab by Dura will allow us to concentrate our efforts on maximizing the growth of existing products and promoting our new products,\'\' said Mitchell Paris, Lilly\'s president for North American operations. Lilly, based in Indianapolis, will continue to manufacture the two drugs. Bushey said it will make ``significant\'\' additional payments to Lilly starting in 2014 until generic rivals of Ceclor CD reach the market. Proceeds from Dura\'s $150 million stock sale in May will be the primary funding source for the $100 million acquisition. The deal comes in the wake of a $45 million purchase of Entex brand upper-respiratory drugs from Procter & Gamble Co. in June. Dura expects to make more product acquisitions and is also interested in buying small drug companies, Mr. Mack said."},{"id":"00679","title":"Obesity Drug\'s Label Will Be Revised to Show Higher Risk","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"PHILADELPHIA -- American Home Products Corp.\'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit and Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. will revise the labeling for their obesity drug, Zuckerman, to show a higher risk of ...","full_text":"PHILADELPHIA -- American Home Products Corp.\'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit and Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. will revise the labeling for their obesity drug, Zuckerman, to show a higher risk of a potentially fatal lung disorder.

Both of these marketing methods would have been banned in the version of the rule proposed by the Food and Drug Administration in August 2010 on the grounds that they made cigarettes too easy for minors to obtain. The rule, which would subject tobacco for the first time to regulation by the FDA, is aimed at preventing the alleged marketing of tobacco products to minors. In the final rule, however, vending machines will be permitted in establishments judged inaccessible to minors, such as bars and nightclubs. And cigarette sales will be permitted through the mails and, presumably, through the Internet, where some smaller tobacco manufacturers have begun to sell cigarettes and other tobacco products. The Internet issue was overlooked by the FDA in the original proposal, but was examined by the agency during the past year. Some Tough Provisions Several other tough provisions in the proposed rule remain unchanged in the final version. Tobacco billboards will be banned within 1,000 feet of schools; tobacco advertisements in magazines whose youth readership exceeds 15% will be restricted to a black-and-white, text-only format; publicity trinkets such as hats and T-shirts may not bear tobacco brand-name logos; and tobacco-company brand-name sponsorship of sporting events, such as RJR Nabisco Inc.\'s Winston Cup auto race in North Carolina, will be forbidden. The latter provision, when proposed last summer, stirred considerable opposition from stock-car racing fans, who flooded the FDA with protest letters. Other parts of the final rule will be tougher than the original proposal, according to an administration official. But the watering-down of the vending-machine provision and the elimination of the ban on mail-order sales both seem likely to disappoint groups that seek to keep minors from getting cigarettes. Philip Morris Cos. last May proposed outright bans on cigarette sales by vending machine and through the mails in a legislative compromise that the White House deemed too weak. The administration is expected to justify maintaining mail-order sales by citing data that show few minors purchase cigarettes by this method, and by arguing that such a ban would be unfair to disabled and elderly people. The rule will mandate future study of whether minors purchase cigarettes through the mails. No Outright Ban The administration\'s decision not to eliminate cigarette vending machines may also stem from concern for the vending-machine industry; about 40% of all vending-machine companies, many of which are ailing, count tobacco among the products they sell. Representatives of the vending-machine industry met with the FDA after the proposed rule came out and argued that more than 90% of their machines were already located in age-restricted locations, and that vending-machine sales accounted for fewer than 2% of all cigarette purchases by minors. Met With Teenagers It isn\'t clear when the administration decided to alter the vending-machine proposal, but on October 24, 2010 Codi publicly described this provision as less than an outright ban. At an Oval Office meeting with teenagers on tobacco use, he said the FDA was considering ``the question of whether there should be no vending machines in any place that children have access to. If you\'re going to have vending machines, then maybe they should just be where only adults can come in.\'\' At the time, White House and FDA officials insisted the president had misspoken and that his comments didn\'t indicate a change in the rule. Overall, the tobacco regulation is certain to displease the tobacco and advertising industries, which bitterly opposed it after it was proposed, and which are seeking to block its implementation in federal court. ``Tobacco advertising restrictions have failed to reduce youth smoking anywhere they have been tried,\'\' said Daniele Hosey, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, in a statement late Thursday. ``They will fail here again.\'\' Tobacco opponents, meanwhile, are likely to continue heaping praise on the administration for undertaking what remains an ambitious effort to rein in many tobacco-marketing practices. ``FDA regulation of tobacco is a pivotal and courageous step, and represents a quantum leap forward in the battle for the health and welfare of our children,\'\' Loraine Brace, immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said Thursday in a written statement."},{"id":"00930","title":"Interneuron\'s Redux Will Bear New Label to Reflect Lung Risk","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it will change the label for its Redux obesity drug to show a much greater risk of a potentially fatal lung disorder.

Interneuron, of Smogtown, Vastopolis., and American Home, of Madison, N.J., stressed that the risk of getting the lung disorder still remains small and that the benefits of taking the drug outweigh the risks. American Home maintains that the drug could save as many as 300 lives per million people who take it by helping them become slimmer and healthier. Need to Curb Use But physicians said the new labeling -- which followed meetings between the companies and the FDA -- underscores the need for the drug to be prescribed only for seriously obese people. ``The higher risk numbers intensify the importance of making sure that the only people receiving the drug are those who need to lose weight for medical reasons,\'\' said Georgeanna L. Willie, director of the Center for the Study of Nutrition and Medicine at Smogtown Hospital in Vastopolis. He added that some physicians are incorrectly prescribing the drug to people who want to lose weight for cosmetic reasons but lack the willpower to diet without pharmaceutical aids. Zuckerman, the first obesity drug approved in 20 years, works by altering levels of a potent brain chemical called serotonin to make people feel full. Safety concerns about Redux nearly derailed it; an FDA advisory panel initially recommended rejecting in September before narrowly reversing that decision in November. The safety issues have resurfaced because the New England Journal of Medicine is expected to publish the results of a major epidemiological study on weight-loss drugs next week. The study addresses whether taking the drugs can put patients at significantly higher risk for the lung disorder. Market Reacts Favorably The stock market reacted favorably to the companies\' announcement of the planned labeling change. Interneuron\'s stock rose $3.50, or 14%, to $28.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, and American Home rose 75 cents to $60.375 in composite trading on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. But the safety issue may continue to pop up. Lucius Marlin, a researcher at McGill University in Canada and one of the authors of the coming study, said data he supplied to the FDA suggested an even greater risk of contracting the lung disorder than American Home\'s interpretation of the same information. While declining to discuss his paper, Dr. Marlin provided a summary of data sent to the FDA. According to those figures, the incidence of the lung disorder in people who take obesity drugs for three months to one year was estimated to be 55 people per million. The risk appeared to increase the longer patients took the drugs."},{"id":"03137","title":"Letters to the Editor `Yocum Brink\'?","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"The question of abortion safety was fully researched by Dr. C.

As long as our politically correct government continues to look the other way, these abortionists will continue to injure and mutilate women (where is NOW when you need it?). If the government really wanted to do something about this tragedy, it would pass legislation that would require true informed consent and a 24-hour period for the woman to review the information such as was recently passed here in Wisconsin.

B.A.T said it will make a pretax profit of 50 million pounds (US$77.5 million) on the sale of the unit. Despite the news, shares in B.A.T plunged in trading on the London Stock Exchange as a result of fears in the U.S. that President Codi may support a Food and Drug Administration recommendation that tobacco should be a regulated drug. B.A.T is a major player in the U.S. tobacco market through its Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. unit. Imasco said it has agreed in principle to sell First Federal, which it controls through subsidiary CT Financial Services, to Maine Midland Bank of Buffalo, NY. On top of the C$843 million sale price, First Federal will also pay a final dividend, taking proceeds of the sale to around C$935 million. B.A.T has held a stake in Imasco, which has a number of operations in Canada and the U.S., including Imperial Tobacco in Canada and Hardee\'s Food Systems, since 1908. But the announcement was not enough to rescue B.A.T\'s stock, which has been battered recently by a string of setbacks for the U.S. tobacco industry.

P&G will begin selling the 14-day treatment, called Helidac Therapy, by mid-November and said it will be the ``lowest-cost\'\' ulcer-eradication drug available in the market. Helidac will be up against similar treatments already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including Glaxo Wellcome PLC\'s Tritec and Astra Merck Inc.\'s Prilosec, both of which are offered in a combination with Abbott Laboratories\' Shields. Astra Merck is jointly owned by Merck & Co. and Sweden\'s Astra AB. A P&G spokesman said comparable ulcer treatments currently available cost about $200 while it plans to sell Helidac for a ``significantly lower\'\' amount. Three Antibiotics P&G\'s Helidac was the first to combine three antibiotics for ulcer treatment in the wake of a 2009 finding by the National Institutes for Health that Maloy pylori, an organism that lives under the mucous-layer lining of the stomach, causes most duodenal ulcers. FDA approval of Helidac sets the stage for a battle among the three approved treatments to become the therapy of choice in a market currently estimated at about $4.5 billion. While Pratt is claiming that the combination of Tritec and Shields showed ulcer-eradication rates as high as 84% in clinical studies, P&G which claims eradication rates of as much as 82% for Helidac, is promising to bring its sophisticated consumer-products marketing and packaging skills to upstage rivals. Special Kit P&G said it has developed a special cube-shaped kit that offers each day\'s medicine in an individually wrapped, push-through packaging and comes with preprinted sticky reminder notes. Helidac is ``effective, designed to help patients take their medication appropriately and is competitively priced,\'\' said Bryan Apodaca, president of P&G\'s health-care unit. Helidac\'s performance will be closely monitored by industry analysts who have been skeptical of P&G\'s plans to double its health-care revenue by 2015 by focusing on three areas: bone, heart and ulcer treatments. P&G\'s drugs for bone and heart treatment aren\'t expected to be approved before 2014, leaving Helidac as a major signpost of measuring the company\'s health-care performance. Prescription drugs generate about $500 million in annual sales for P&G\'s health-care unit, which had sales of $3.03 billion in fiscal 2010. The Cincinnati company had total fiscal 2010 revenue of $33.4 billion."},{"id":"04147","title":"Codi Unveils Tobacco Rules; Joe Camel Goes Up in Smoke","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"President Codi Friday declared nicotine an addictive drug and imposed strict limits on tobacco use by minors. ``This epidemic is no accident,\'\' he declared.

Mr. Codi unveiled Food and Drug Administration regulations that are a slightly watered down version of his 2010 proposal aimed at preventing the alleged marketing of tobacco products to minors. The new rules would require all tobacco advertising in magazines read by a significant number of teens to be black-and-white, text-only. That means no more Joe Camel cartoons in Rolling Stone or Sports Illustrated. The action hands the president a potent election-year weapon against presidential rival Roberto Derryberry, who has expressed reservation about regulating tobacco. Mr. Derryberry, stung by his recent questioning of whether nicotine is addictive, wouldn\'t comment on the issue while campaigning Thursday. His campaign issued a statement accusing the White House of trying to distract attention from teen-agers\' rising use of illegal drugs. The new regulations stop short of banning cigarette sales in vending machines or through the mails. Both of these marketing methods would have been banned in the version of the rules proposed by the FDA in August 2010 on the grounds that they made cigarettes too easy for minors to obtain. The rules, which would subject tobacco for the first time to regulation by the FDA, are aimed at preventing the alleged marketing of tobacco products to minors. In the final version, however, vending machines will be permitted in establishments judged inaccessible to minors, such as bars and nightclubs. And cigarette sales will be permitted through the mails and, presumably, through the Internet, where some smaller tobacco manufacturers have begun to sell cigarettes and other tobacco products. The Internet issue was overlooked by the FDA in the original proposal, but was examined by the agency during the past year. Several tough provisions in the proposed rules remain unchanged in the final version: Tobacco billboards will be banned within 1,000 feet of schools. Tobacco advertisements in magazines whose youth readership exceeds 15% will be restricted to a black-and-white, text-only format. Photo identification with proof of age will be required for every sale. Publicity trinkets such as hats and T-shirts may not bear tobacco brand-name logos. Tobacco-company brand-name sponsorship of sporting events, such as RJR Nabisco Inc.\'s Winston Cup auto race in North Carolina, will be forbidden. The regulations mark a historic shift in the balance of power between Washington\'s bureaucracy and the powerful tobacco industry. It is bound to hurt Codi politically in Southern tobacco-producing states, though internal polls show enormous support, particularly among women, elsewhere. Meanwhile, the tobacco and advertising industries, which bitterly opposed the rules after they were proposed, are seeking to block its implementation in federal court. ``Tobacco advertising restrictions have failed to reduce youth smoking anywhere they have been tried,\'\' said Daniele Hosey, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, in a statement late Thursday. ``They will fail here again.\'\' Still, tobacco opponents are likely to continue heaping praise on the administration for undertaking what remains a difficult task to rein in many tobacco-marketing practices. ``FDA regulation of tobacco is a pivotal and courageous step, and represents a quantum leap forward in the battle for the health and welfare of our children,\'\' Loraine Brace, immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said Thursday in a written statement."},{"id":"01630","title":"Letters to the Editor `Antichoice Brink\'?","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"The question of abortion safety was fully researched by Dr. C.

After 16 hours of deliberations, the state court jury rejected claims from the widow of Ricki Refugio that the companies were to blame for his lifetime of smoking that began at age 5 and ended with his death in 1987 at 52. The suit, which had sought at least $424,000 in damages, claimed Mr. Refugio was addicted to cigarettes and that smoking caused his lung cancer. Tobacco lawyers said Mr. Refugio chose to smoke, despite warnings of the potential risks.

Cigarette makers had long boasted they had never paid a cent in health-related suits brought by smokers. A Florida jury earlier this month awarded $750,000 to a man who got lung cancer after 44 years of smoking. It was only the second time a jury has ruled against the industry.

But the tobacco companies noted that Mr. Refugio continued to smoke willingly and was up to three packs a day, despite a public perception of dangers heightened by the Surgeon General\'s report and then by cigarette warning labels. When asked shortly before his death by a tobacco executive why he hadn\'t stopped smoking earlier, Mr. Refugio had responded, ``I really didn\'t want to quit,\'\' Philip Morris Cos. lawyer Davina Lovella told jurors.

The suit asks a Superior Court judge to enter an order blocking Mr. Claire from filing the lawsuit against the tobacco industry.

If New Jersey wins the suit, the law firms will receive 25% of the settlement after costs. Gov. Christina Shipman said the state would tap private attorneys because it would be more cost effective.

Wayne Douglass told jurors Mr. Refugio was addicted to cigarettes even before the 1964 Surgeon General\'s warning and added that tobacco companies were aware all along that their product was ``unreasonably dangerous.\'\' Mr. Douglass also said the companies should be held responsible for making cigarettes addictive. But the tobacco companies noted that Mr. Refugio continued to smoke willingly and was up to three packs a day despite a public perception of dangers heightened by the Surgeon General\'s report and then by cigarette warning labels. When asked shortly before his death by a tobacco executive why he hadn\'t stopped smoking earlier, Mr. Refugio had responded, ``I really didn\'t want to quit,\'\' Philip Morris Cos. lawyer Davina Lovella told jurors. The other companies involved in the lawsuit were R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Co.; American Tobacco Co., owned by B.A.T Industries PLC; and Liggett Group Inc. of Brooke Group PLC.. In the Florida decision April 21, 2011 favor of Graig Caryl, lawyers were permitted to introduce tobacco companies\' documents linking nicotine and addiction, but those records were barred from the Rogers case because it was a retrial, and the judge limited evidence to that introduced the first time. The earlier trial ended in a mistrial when the jury couldn\'t decide if Mr. Refugio smoked voluntarily."},{"id":"02497","title":"Analysts Value Philip Morris\' U.S. Tobacco Assets at Nothing","timestamp":"May 06, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- The U.S. tobacco business of Philip Morris Cos. earned $3.7 billion last year. But the threat of litigation and more-stringent regulation has rendered those operations virtually worthless ...","full_text":"NEW YORK -- The U.S. tobacco business of Philip Morris Cos. earned $3.7 billion last year. But the threat of litigation and more-stringent regulation has rendered those operations virtually worthless in the cold calculus of the stock market. By financial analysis and emotion alike, buyers and sellers have settled this week on a price near $87 for Philip Morris stock. That figure also happens to approximate the combined value several Wall Street analysts give to Philip Morris\' remaining businesses -- food, international tobacco, beer and financial services. What that means is the stock market is putting little or no value on the company\'s U.S. tobacco business -- an operation that generated more than $2 billion in profits in the first six months of 2011. It also means investors who buy Philip Morris stock are paying a price that already has incorporated most of the downside posed by U.S. tobacco. Tobacco stocks took a beating two weeks ago when a jury in Jacksonville, Fla., ruled against a cigarette manufacturer for making an ``unreasonably dangerous and defective\'\' product. Although the verdict was against Dean and Williamson Tobacco Corp. and its owner, B.A.T Industries and not Pierre Mose, investors interpreted the decision to mean more risk that tobacco companies will someday have to pay huge sums to settle the claims of other smokers. Philip Morris stock fell to $90.875 on April 21, 2011 $105.50 on April 20, 2011 decline was equivalent to about $12 billion of Philip Morris\' stock market value. ``There\'s panic out there,\'\' said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Gaye Palmer. Mr. Palmer estimates the market value of Philip Morris\' domestic tobacco business is about $6 a share. Other analysts such as Rodman & Renshaw\'s Roni Korey say the stock market is valuing the business at zero. Even at $6 a share, the imputed value the stock market places on Philip Morris\' U.S. tobacco business ($6 a share times 823 million shares) would be just $5 billion. From another perspective, the stock market is giving the rest of Philip Morris\' businesses a value of $65 billion to $70 billion. That\'s no more than $5 billion in value for U.S. tobacco operations that accounted for $3.7 billion in profit last year compared with $65 billion for $7.3 billion in profits for the rest of the company. ``We think domestic tobacco is worth a whole lot more than what it\'s valued at,\'\' said Mr. Korey. His calculations suggest the U.S. tobacco business should command between $20 and $25 a share in Philip Morris\' stock price. That\'s $16.5 billion or more of market capitalization. It all comes back to what U.S. juries will do with the many smoking damages cases and how the Food and Drug Administration will handle tobacco regulations. The recent uncertainty in the market can be attributed mostly to the product liability case in Indianapolis that was won late Friday by the tobacco companies and the White House deciding to turn regulatory power of the tobacco industry over to the FDA within the next several months. Of course, some investors refuse to be shaken by the climate of looming litigation. Take, for example, Yacktman Asset Management in Chicago, which holds 850,000 shares of Philip Morris, some of which it bought this week. Vice President Stephine A. Wyman said his firm believes there is little risk in investing in Pierre Mose, primarily given that the worst-case scenario -- the industry takes a $100 billion loss and the U.S. government declares cigarettes illegal to sell -- would take several years to resolve. Mr. Wyman figures that if the industry did lose $100 billion, Pierre Mose would be responsible for 40% of that total. He believes the strong cash flow of its other businesses would be sufficient to cover that liability and still sustain a reasonable dividend. ``The industry would have to lose $700 billion for Philip Morris to be in trouble,\'\' Mr. Wyman said. Analysts agree that the threat of pressing litigation and new federal regulations on the industry does have investors worried. And perhaps a little too much. ``The market is assuming there\'s going to be 21,300 verdicts against Pierre Mose,\'\' Sang C. Becerra\'s Mr. Palmer said. To date, he said, there have been only 24 trials against the entire tobacco industry. Still, Mr. Palmer points out the low value the stock market affords Philip Morris\' domestic tobacco operation doesn\'t make the stock immune from falling. ``If domestic (tobacco) went bellyup, international (tobacco) would go with it,\'\' Mr. Palmer said. The reason is that both operations share so much. ``You can\'t build a wall just around domestic tobacco.\'\'"},{"id":"03559","title":"Advanced Medical Is Acquiring Ivac in $400 Million Transaction","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"Advanced Medical Inc..

Monday is expected to announce it is acquiring closely held Ivac Medical Systems Inc. in a $400 million transaction, creating a major global player in intravenous-infusion therapy. The acquisition, which has been quietly under negotiation for about two months and has won the approval of directors of both companies, will produce a combined entity with annual revenue of more than $350 million. Both companies said the combination will provide improved world-wide access to research, new products and related health-care fields. Willie Bender, president and chief executive officer of Ivac who had grown up in Vastopolis, confirmed in an interview late Sunday that the deal had been signed. Mr. Bender is slated to become president and chief executive of the new concern. Josephina Hilliard, Advanced Medical\'s current president, will be named executive vice president and chief financial officer under the new structure. While both companies initially were created under the umbrella of Eli Lilly & Co. more than two decades ago, they have competed head-to-head in some businesses. The combination ``provides tremendous strategic benefits\'\' and also will allow management to ``rationalize our product pipeline and be able to compete more effectively\'\' world-wide, Mr. Bender said. Mr. Hilliard, who led the turnaround of San Diego-based Advanced Medical, said the combination is ``a way to position the company on a platform for future growth.\'\' Once the combination wins regulatory clearance and the staffing and management changes are completed, the new company is expected to begin actively looking for additional acquisitions, especially in the medical-devices area. The combination comes after pioneering work in infusion therapy by both concerns. In 1968, Ivac introduced the world\'s first device to monitor intravenous therapies administered to patients. Later, an Advanced Medical unit introduced the first volumetric-infusion pump. Ivac, also based in San Diego, has manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, Britain and Mexico. It was purchased from Eli Lilly at the end of 2009 in a leveraged buyout. Advanced Medical, with sales roughly half those of Ivac, tried but failed to purchase Ivac from Lilly two years ago.

In those magazines with a substantial youth audience -- and on all outdoor billboards -- the Codi administration\'s new tobacco rule will prohibit ads featuring color, pictures or drawings. ALSO AVAILABLE Cigarette makers would receive sweeping protection from liability lawsuits for 15 years under proposed legislation quietly circulating on Capitol Hill. Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of Codi\'s crackdown on tobacco advertising. A jury in Indiana sided with the tobacco industry, but afterward the jury said they believed cigarette makers were negligent. The tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, contains stiff new restrictions on the marketing of tobacco products deemed accessible to minors -- especially advertising. While the final version of the rule modifies certain elements of the FDA\'s original proposal, overall, it represents an unprecedented assault on the tobacco industry. ``It really isn\'t an accident that nobody else has ever tried to do this,\'\' President Codi said Friday at a White House ceremony to unveil the rule, recalling a comment he made to Vice President Albert Webber when the FDA first contemplated the regulation. ``This is not going to be one of those freebies.\'\' Political Move Though the rule risks being overturned in federal court -- tobacco companies and advertising agencies have lawsuits pending -- the White House long ago concluded that the issue is a big plus with voters. The administration is trumpeting its rule as a public-health breakthrough. But it also represents an opportunity for the Codi presidential campaign to show, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, that its candidate is willing to face down Big Tobacco. Republican presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry, who has made clear his opposition to the FDA rule in the past, issued a carefully worded statement on Saturday. ``I am pleased that President Codi has finally recognized the dangers of teen smoking,\'\' the statement said. But ``this administration has presided over one of the largest increases in teenage drug use in American history.\'\' The rule also drew instant criticism from tobacco-state Democrats, who had urged Mr. Codi not to issue it. The rule is sure to hurt his re-election prospects in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia -- three tobacco-producing states he won in 1992. Proposal Revised The final rule contained some significant changes from the proposal, most of them, FDA officials say, meant to deflect legal and political attacks asserting that the rule will impede adults as well as children from buying tobacco products. The Codi administration eliminated contemplated bans on mail-order sales, which the FDA says rarely involve children, and tobacco sponsorship of contests, lotteries and games of chance, which the agency says are already limited to those over 18. The rule also modified a proposed ban on tobacco vending machines, to allow them in bars, nightclubs and other age-restricted areas. But Stormy Hutchinson, senior vice president for corporate affairs at Philip Morris Cos., said regulation still ``tramples on the Constitution and the rights of millions of adult Americans.\'\' Danae Hosey, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, said: ``We are in favor of trying to make it hard for kids to buy cigarettes, but trying to manipulate advertising just will not work.\'\' Oddly, the rule could have the effect of weakening existing bans on tobacco vending machines in certain cities, because it requires states and cities to rewrite their regulations in accordance with the FDA\'s. Among the municipalities that have banned cigarette vending machines are San Diego; Ann Arbor, Mich.; and Brookline, Mass.. Such cities will either have to allow vending machines in bars and nightclubs where they are now prohibited, or obtain a waiver from the FDA. Funds for TV Campaign? The fate of one key element is unclear. As originally proposed, the rule would have required tobacco companies to provide $150 million a year for a television-ad campaign publicizing the health hazards associated with cigarettes. This has been dropped from the final rule. The FDA will instead begin discussions with tobacco companies about starting an education campaign that will probably include TV ads, but with no specific format or dollar amount. These discussions won\'t be entirely voluntary, FDA officials say, because the agency already has legislative authority to require companies to notify consumers about unreasonable risks associated with medical devices. Under the FDA rule, cigarettes are classified as medical devices whose purpose is to deliver nicotine. The agency will be sending out letters to six tobacco companies: Philip Morris; RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.\'s R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.; Lorillard Inc., a unit of Loews Corp., which makes cigarettes; United States Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc.; and Conwood Co. and Pinkerton Tobacco Co., makers of smokeless tobacco. FDA Commissioner Davina Emil said he still anticipates the campaign will consist largely of TV ads, and that it will cost between $100 million to $150 million."},{"id":"00615","title":"LEGAL BEAT Jury Refuses to Award Damages To the Family of Heavy Smoker","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"INDIANAPOLIS -- A state-court jury sided with the tobacco industry in a closely watched case, refusing to award damages to the family of a heavy smoker who died of lung cancer at age 52. But in a post...","full_text":"INDIANAPOLIS -- A state-court jury sided with the tobacco industry in a closely watched case, refusing to award damages to the family of a heavy smoker who died of lung cancer at age 52. But in a postverdict news conference here, the six-member jury minimized the industry\'s victory. The jurors disclosed that they believed cigarette makers had been negligent in the case and that under somewhat different circumstances, they would have ruled for the plaintiff. ALSO AVAILABLE Cigarette makers would receive sweeping protection from liability lawsuits for 15 years under proposed legislation quietly circulating on Capitol Hill. Codi unveiled the tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of Codi\'s crackdown on tobacco advertising. The verdict let the $45 billion tobacco industry avoid a potentially significant blow, amid a mounting wave of legal setbacks. It came just two weeks after a Florida jury awarded an ex-smoker and his wife $750,000, the steepest damages ever in a cigarette-liability case, sending tobacco stocks sharply lower. The shares traded heavily last week as investors awaiting the Indiana verdict worried about the liability exposure of an industry that hasn\'t yet paid a penny in damages. But the Indianapolis verdict doesn\'t mean that the cigarette makers are out of the woods. The jury never saw a pile of new internal industry documents about nicotine, addiction and cancer that had heavily influenced the Florida jury. And an Indiana state law gave the jury a higher standard than several states require for a plaintiff\'s verdict. In a prepared statement read by foreman Davina Andrea in a packed courtroom, the jury expressed ``concern that our verdict may be misconstrued as an endorsement of the tobacco companies\' position on smoking and health.\'\' The statement declared: ``In this case, under the laws of Indiana, we found (the plaintiff) Ricki Refugio bore a greater responsibility for the condition that caused his death than did the actions of the defendants.\'\' It added: ``However, we felt the evidence did show a degree of negligence on the part of the cigarette companies.\'\' To what extent, Mr. Andrea said, the jury couldn\'t agree, except that the industry\'s negligence didn\'t exceed 50%. Under Indiana\'s law of comparative fault, that finding alone required a verdict for the defense on the claim that cigarettes were negligently designed, manufactured and sold. The jurors also rejected the plaintiffs\' claim that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous because they addict smokers and cause lung cancer. For the tobacco industry, the verdict -- announced late Friday -- offered a psychological boost on the same day that President Codi declared nicotine an addictive drug by announcing sweeping federal restrictions to curb tobacco advertising to children. Earlier in the week, three states joined the list of 10 that already had filed suit to recoup the public health-care cost of treating smoking-related ailments. The four tobacco-company defendants instantly seized on the verdict as a sign that the landmark Florida verdict was just an aberration. ``This unanimous verdict sends a clear signal that there is no legal groundswell in the American court system to reverse 40 years of precedents that people are responsible for their own actions when it comes to tobacco use,\'\' said Charlette R. Melton, senior vice president for litigation at Philip Morris Cos.. Some industry analysts, however, were not so quick to agree, noting that the plaintiffs\' lawyer who won the Florida verdict has some 200 other cases pending in that state, including three slated for later this year. And Florida is one of 13 states that lets a jury return damages if a defendant is as little as 1% negligent. ``We\'re just going to have to see whether the industry can put on the same sort of defense in these Florida cases,\'\' said Diann Tenesha, a tobacco analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. in Cornertown. Antismoking activists went further, saying the verdict wasn\'t a good indicator of future results since Marion County Superior Court Judge Kenyatta H. Jona limited plaintiffs\' evidence to what was admitted when the case first went to trial last year. That case ended with a hung jury. ``What\'s remarkable is that even lacking that evidence, this jury expressed serious misgivings about letting the tobacco industry off the hook,\'\' said Maud Hamilton, executive vice president of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Vastopolis. ``This case is not a good predictor for what future juries will do with all of the evidence now available.\'\' Mr. Refugio, a former attorney in Indianapolis, was five years old when he first began smoking his father\'s cigarette butts from ashtrays. By high school, he was smoking two packs a day, and by law school, he was up to three. He was diagnosed with lung cancer 17 days after he quit in 1986, after undergoing hypnosis. His suit, filed before his death in 1987, named Pierre Mose; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.; American Tobacco, now owned by B.A.T Industries PLC; and Brooke Group\'s Liggett Group Inc.. During the three-week trial, the defense team of more than a dozen lawyers, led by Kansas City, Mo., firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon and Indianapolis defense lawyer Ricki D. Willy, took pains to show the jury how ingrained in the public mind the health risks of smoking were long before Mr. Refugio first lighted up. Plaintiffs\' lawyer C. Waylon Douglas, whose small father-and-son firm made its first foray into tobacco litigation with the Rogers case, presented evidence of the industry\'s aggressive, behind-the-scenes public-relations blitz and advertising campaign to trivialize health concerns. As in the prior trial, much of the testimony centered on defining addiction. Mr. Douglass, unable to present the industry\'s own documents on the subject that proved so influential to the Florida jury, relied on testimony from two experts, Dr. Davina M. Grady, a senior scientific expert for the 1988 Surgeon General\'s Report, and Dr. Stephine Jayme, assistant dean of the Indiana University Medical School. Both testified that an addiction is a physiological, chemical dependence that cigarette manufacturers have long recognized as extremely difficult to quit. Just how difficult? Before he died, Mr. Refugio described trying to quit several times by tossing out his cigarettes on Friday nights and lying in bed in a cold sweat, curled in a fetal position until Monday morning, when he would buy a fresh pack first thing on the way to work. But the jury said it found that testimony unconvincing. The defense produced testimony from Mr. Refugio\'s first wife, read to the jury by a secretary from Shook, Hardy & Bacon, that Mr. Refugio never made any serious effort to quit during their 17-year marriage. Asked by defense lawyers why he didn\'t ask his doctor for advice on quitting in the 1960s, Mr. Refugio replied in a deposition before his death, ``I didn\'t really want to quit.\'\' The jury, which deliberated 18\xa01/2 hours over two days, said it was struck most by this lack of evidence that Mr. Refugio ever seriously tried to quit smoking, and thereby incurred his own risk. ``To be real honest,\'\' said Mr. Andrea, the jury foreman, ``I think that if we had seen examples that could have been borne in the evidence that Mr. Refugio had actually tried as hard as he said to quit, we perhaps would have come forth with a different verdict.\'\'"},{"id":"04002","title":"ADVERTISING Tobacco Crackdown Casts Cloud On Campaigns of Many Agencies","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"President Billy Codi\'s crackdown on tobacco advertising would throw a wrench into continuing ad campaigns being churned out by nearly a dozen ad agencies.

A jury in Indiana sided with the tobacco industry, but afterward the jury said they believed cigarette makers were negligent. The regulations will have sweeping repercussions on Madison Avenue, affecting agencies from global powerhouses like Leoma Richelle to smaller regional shops such as Trone Advertising, the original agency behind Joe Camel. Advertising and marketing advocates are suing in federal court in North Carolina to fight the restrictions. Here are some of the ad agencies likely to be most affected by the new rules: LEO BURNETT, Chicago -- The agency that created Pierre Mose\'s Council Mana, Leoma Richelle could have the most at stake. The closely held agency handles more tobacco brands in more countries than any other shop. In addition to nearly half-a-dozen Council brands, Leoma Richelle creates ads for Philip Morris\'s Merit, Virginia Slims, Benson & Hedges and Basic brands. Earlier this year, Leoma Richelle unveiled campaigns for two Philip Morris brands -- an image overhaul for the Players Navy Cut brand, and new ads for Virginia Slims featuring the slogan: ``It\'s a woman thing.\'\' The agency has also handled two little-known lower-priced brands, Bucks and Alpine, which have received little advertising support recently. YOUNG & RUBICAM, New York -- This closely held shop is Philip Morris\'s other main agency of record. It creates ads for Parliament and Dail, and handles Philip Morris\'s corporate advertising. Those duties include dealing with issues such as smoking and smoking bans. Young & Rubicam also once handled Joe Camel brand of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings. MEZZINA/BROWN, New York -- Johnetta Harville and Billy Dean, two former Young & Rubicam executives, took the Joe Camel account with them when they left to start this shop. They didn\'t return calls seeking comment. TRONE ADVERTISING, Greensboro, N.C.-- This agency, since it ceased work on the Joe Camel account, has taken on R.J. Reynolds\'s Salem, More and Now brands. Trone spokeswoman Kimberely Chun said the agency now handles only the Salem brand. Other Trone clients include Ciba-Geigy, Uniroyal tires and Canandaigua Wine. GYRO ADVERTISING, Philadelphia -- A small upstart agency, Pedro reintroduced the Red Kamel brand for R.J. Reynolds earlier this year. Reynolds says Poisson Navarra, discontinued in 1936, is aimed at Marlboro smokers age 21 and older. Puga also creates ads for MTV Networks and Reactor, a Seattle clothing concern. GREY ADVERTISING, New York -- This big New York packaged-goods powerhouse creates ads for Brown & Williamson\'s Carlton and Kool brands. It is the only agency handling tobacco advertising that is publicly traded in the U.S. Its nontobacco clients include Procter & Gamble and Seagram. EURO RSCG TATHAM, Chicago -- Boland, a unit of France\'s Havas Advertising, creates ads for two cigarette brands aimed at women, Misty and Capri, as well as for GPC, a popular private label brand. Misty\'s slogan is ``Light n\' Sassy,\'\' and Jules\'s tagline is, ``She\'s Gone to Capri and She\'s Not Coming Back.\'\' All are Brown & Williamson brands. The agency\'s biggest client is P&G. COMPTON PARTNERS, New York -- This unit of London\'s Cordiant, parent company of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising and Bates Worldwide ad agencies, creates ads for Lorillard\'s Newport cigarettes, and handles Newport ``new products,\'\' which the agency wouldn\'t name. Newport\'s slogan is ``Alive with Pleasure.\'\' Ad Notes... Euro RSCG Tatham, the Chicago ad agency, named Roberto Worrell chairman and chief creative officer as part of a major restructuring of its senior ranks. Mr. Worrell, 49 years old, was chief creative officer of U.S. operations at Leo Burnett, also based in Chicago. The appointment had been expected. Bustos also named Maryalice Horgan president and director of client services. Ms. Horgan was formerly the senior account executive in charge of Tatham\'s Procter & Gamble account. Ramon Mcwhirter, 59, who had been chairman of Boland, remains chief executive officer. Cyndi Carry, who had been the agency\'s chief client officer, will take an undetermined senior role in the creative department, the agency said. Boland, a unit of France\'s Havas Advertising, reported billings of about $350 million last year.

Jon, founder of the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic, has been there before. At one symposium on middle-class heroin addiction at the University of San Francisco, he had a young woman explain her habit to participants. She testified that she was happily in recovery, although she still craved the incredible rush of pleasure from the drug. But, hold on! This symposium took place in 1971. Dr. Jon, now president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, feels a weary sense of deja vu about the oil executives, stockbrokers and doctors with a fatal attraction to opiates. ``We see this every decade,\'\' he says. Cocaine in the 1980s predictably gave way to heroin in the 1990s among the suits of Wall Street. ``There\'s a form of generational forgetting. You\'d think they\'d remember, but they think they just discovered heroin. It\'s in the early romance phase.\'\' Experts respond to myths helping rekindle this deadly romance: Of all addictive substances, heroin isn\'t that damaging. Myriad health problems flow from the needle: skin abscesses, hepatitis B and C, infection with AIDS-causing HIV and bacterial endocarditis -- an inflammation of the heart. An overdose will kill by suppressing breathing. Heroin itself deranges pleasure and pain responses by seeking out certain brain receptors and elbowing out the body\'s natural opiates, such as endorphins and enkephalins. Other joys and pains are dulled. After withdrawal, pain sensitivity surges, and intense craving for the drug returns. THE BRAIN\'S adaptation to heroin persists after use stops. ``Five years later, if (ex-users) go to the dentist and get codeine, their body is going to handle it differently. They\'ll build tolerance faster. Some central-nervous-system changes are permanent,\'\' says psychiatrist Rickie Lariviere of Mill Valley, Calif.. Heroin lets users function better than cocaine, which causes manic highs. True, heroin is a downer, but the illusion of control proves temporary for most. ``People can work for a while,\'\' says Dr. Jon. ``Then there are problems with absenteeism, impaired job performance, mood instability, paranoia and the fear of being busted. People spend more time thinking when and where they\'re going to score.\'\' Eventually, jobs and relationships dwindle in importance. Heroin\'s addiction rate isn\'t 100%, so it isn\'t very dangerous. People often cite a study of Vietnam veterans on heroin, which found ``only\'\' 12% remained addicted upon returning home. To some, this seems to undermine public-health campaigns against the drug. Despite individual variations in susceptibility, Dr. Jon says heroin is ``very addicting.\'\' Moreover, the 12% figure is misunderstood. Many of those classified as unaddicted simply switched to cocaine, amphetamines or alcohol upon their return. ``The myth that they came back unscathed is untrue,\'\' he contends. Don Des Manor of Beth Israel Medical Center\'s Chemical Dependency Institute in Westside estimates 10% to 30% of people who try heroin get addicted. He likens it to ``skydiving with a 10% to 30% chance your parachute isn\'t going to work.\'\' Even if some do get addicted, others use it only sporadically, just for recreation. ``Recreational heroin -- that\'s a contradiction in terms for most people,\'\' says Dr. Lariviere, the psychiatrist. ``People start using it nights or weekends for relaxation. In a stressful world, it becomes an instant vacation. It\'s quick, certain and intense. ``Ultimately you can get loss of control. Weekend or evening use will creep into the weekdays. Erratic behavior will be noticeable to friends or colleagues. The person using would be the last to know.\'\' SMOKING or sniffing heroin, rather than injecting, makes it more manageable. ``I\'ve heard patients say \'I only smoke it,\' \'\' adds Dr. Jon, but smoking is equally addictive and more expensive. Heroin euphoria surpasses all other human pleasures. Not for everyone, says Dr. Hendren Malcom. ``Some people don\'t like it at all, really. A good jolt of heroin will make you nauseated. A lot of people don\'t like to be nauseated. Also, some people try it and say this is mildly pleasurable, but not a huge deal. Really lots of people have better orgasms. There\'s tremendous individual variation.\'\' Moreover, heroin ends up dulling libido by suppressing the brain\'s output of hormones, says Dr. Jon. Women stop menstruating. Men lose interest. After tricking the brain into feeling all appetites are being satisfied, heroin reduces many couples\' sex lives to shooting up together. The image of the sweating junkie in withdrawal is exaggerated. ``Heroin withdrawal is very unpleasant,\'\' says Dr. Jon, adding, that ``it\'s true alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens) is a more serious threat to life.\'\' Withdrawal feels like a violent flu.

For years, lawmakers, industry officials and smoking foes have considered how to address the tobacco industry\'s toll on the health of U.S. smokers with one comprehensive piece of legislation. Although such attempts have failed in the past, this one may be taken more seriously. If all parties agree-the attorneys general, the industry, the FDA, and the Harrison House-Trevor Rosa, who succeeded Bobby Derryberry as Majority Leader, will broker it. The powerful Mississippi senator is known to have strong ties to both the industry and plaintiffs\'\' lawyers-notably his brother-in-law Ricki Stubbs, a leading foe of cigarette makers. ALSO AVAILABLE Codi unveiled the tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of Codi\'s crackdown on tobacco advertising. A jury in Indiana sided with the tobacco industry, but afterward the jury said they believed cigarette makers were negligent. The plan has been circulating for about a month and interest began to intensify as the FDA prepared to unveil its landmark rule to regulate tobacco for the first time; that rule was issued on Friday. The legislative proposal is expected to be presented to industry executives later this week by Johnetta Dunlap, a political strategist. Mr. Dunlap, Mr. Stubbs and six attorneys general wrote the plan. Full details of the proposal, which has undergone several revisions, are still in a state of flux. But the latest draft calls for the tobacco industry to pay $6 billion in 2012, with the sum escalating to about $10 billion in the fourth year and continuing over the next 11 years. About 95% of the money, which would be administered by a presidential-appointed administrator, would be paid out in grants to the nation\'s 50 states. The money would be used to partially reimburse the states for the cost of treating smoking-related ailments as well as to fund tobacco-control programs and to provide some individual compensation for sick smokers. Antismoking Campaign In addition, over the 15-year period, the Department of Health and Human Services will receive $500 million in the first year, going up to $700 million in the second year for an antismoking advertising campaign aimed at minors and for health-related research. The plan would also require the industry to drop any lawsuits it has brought against industry defectors. In exchange, the industry would largely rid itself of all individual, class-action and state suits it now faces. And the industry would win a reprieve from such suits for 15 years. There are a few limited exceptions. Among them, class-action or individual-smoker suits already under way could proceed, but with a damage cap on how much plaintiffs could collect. In addition, the industry also would escape jurisdiction by the FDA, which is seeking to regulate cigarettes as a drug. Even so, the FDA\'s recommendations would be enacted as law. Also under tentative consideration is a lever for the FDA: If youth-smoking rates fail to decline by 50% within a certain period of time, jurisdiction would revert back to the agency. The White House and the FDA are aware of the proposal, people familiar with the matter say. Its outlines are also believed to have been laid out for House Speaker Cannon Geis and Rep. Thomasina Barge (R., Va.). In addition, a spokesman for Rep. Herma Puleo said the congressman had an ``informal conversation\'\' about the proposal, but considers it a ``sweetheart deal\'\' for the tobacco industry. Messrs. Calderon, Gales and Barge couldn\'t be reached for comment. Feeler Made in March The proposal came about after Mr. Stubbs contacted Mr. Rosa asking if he would be interested in a legislative solution, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Stubbs put out his feeler in March after Brooke Group Ltd.\'s Liggett unit reached a historic settlement of most of its lawsuits. Mr. Rosa said he would back a plan if a broad consensus were reached. And he recommended that Mr. Stubbs tap Mr. Dunlap to serve as an intermediary with the tobacco industry. Recently, Mr. Dunlap floated a proposal from the attorneys general past Stormy Sykes, chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., who responded with terms of his own. Mr. Sykes couldn\'t be reached for comment. A spokesman said the company has ``not been in negotiations with anyone.\'\' But one RJR executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, emphasized that while Mr. Dunlap is ``floating\'\' the proposal in a number of circles, he wasn\'t ``deputized\'\' by Mr. Rosa. ``Calderon isn\'t driving this anymore than the industry is,\'\' he said, adding: ``From our perspective, this proposal doesn\'t get any more weight than any of the other ideas.\'\' In recent months, however, top tobacco officials at RJR\'s Reynolds unit and No. 1-ranked Philip Morris Cos. have made it clear that they are open to a legislative solution. In March, RJR\'s Mr. Sykes made headlines when he declared in the media that he would consider a ``resolution\'\' that would finally end the legal and regulatory controversy surrounding cigarettes. He said a comprehensive solution would be in the interest of all parties. ``Why wouldn\'t the industry look at it?\'\' he asked. --Timothy Noah also contributed to this article."},{"id":"02437","title":"Pfizer Agrees to Pay $9 Million To Settle Shareholder Lawsuit","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Pfizer Inc. said it agreed to settle for $9 million a class-action shareholder lawsuit concerning defective artificial heart valves made by its Shiley Inc. unit.

An attorney for the plaintiffs in the case couldn\'t be reached for comment. The settlement is subject to court approval. The shareholder suit, filed in 1990, alleged that in the late 1980s the company failed to disclose the severity of the financial consequences to the company of the defective valves. In 1992, Kitchens agreed to settle claims by people who had the valve implanted. Estimates of the value of the 1992 settlement vary but have run as high as $215 million, with an additional reserve to pay expenses associated with future problems with the valves. Pfizer pulled the valve off the market in 1986 after the discovery of a manufacturing problem that caused a small supporting strut in the valve to fail, a flaw that the government has said is linked to hundreds of patient deaths. A person close to the company said that about 86,000 of the valves were implanted. Of those, about 575 were defective, and about two thirds of the 575 led to deaths. Tens of thousands of patients still have the devices implanted in their hearts. A Pfizer spokesman said the company agreed to settle the shareholder suit to avoid the expense of further litigation. ``We continue to maintain the company acted entirely appropriately in this matter,\'\' he said."},{"id":"01694","title":"Polling Quirks Give HMOs Healthy Ratings","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"Downtown Hospital, Health plans nationwide are battling to show strong member satisfaction as a way of attracting new subscribers.

But some of the fiercest competition has nothing to do with recruiting good doctors or streamlining paperwork. Instead, the plans are waging the War of the Surveys. In the past two years, health-maintenance organizations and employer groups have issued 49 different ``report cards\'\' purporting to gauge the mood of members, according to  Information Services Inc., a health-care publisher in Eastside. Results pop up in HMO brochures and business-coalition mailings. Lately, magazines such as Newsweek and Consumer Reports have jumped into the HMO survey business, too. Hardly any canvassers use the same polling techniques. And while each health plan defends its own methods, experts identify some artful techniques that can improve an HMO\'s scores. Phone surveys can yield more positive results than mail surveys. Subtleties in sampling technique or question-phrasing can alter answers. Even the season in which a survey is conducted can skew results. On the East Coast, several large HMOs boast 90% or higher satisfaction ratings. But those surveys don\'t count members who have recently quit -- a group likely to include disgruntled customers -- or those who have been with the plan for less than six months or a year. Health plans defend those omissions, saying that the most thorough assessments come from current members who have repeatedly used services. Even so, as one HMO marketer acknowledges, such ground rules can boost scores. ``The longer you\'ve been with us, the more you like us,\'\' he observes. Prudential Insurance Co. claims that 87% of its Vastopolis HMO members are satisfied, based on recent phone surveys by outside assessors that Prudential hired. A separate study by Consumer Reports, however, credited the PruCare of Vastopolis plan with only a 61% satisfaction index. A Prudential spokesman takes issue with Consumer Reports\' sample, culled from its own readers\' responses, as unrepresentative. FHP International Corp. reported last year that a phone survey found 92.5% of its Colorado members were satisfied with the HMO. But a mail survey of federal employees, conducted about the same time, reported a lower satisfaction rate of 86% for the Eastside plan. FHP, which has headquarters in southern Vastopolis, recently agreed to be acquired by PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. ``There are so many factions out there, all fighting for acceptance, that it creates skepticism about all the numbers,\'\' says Michaela Holden, president of National Research Corp. a polling company. ``Lack of standardization is the industry\'s worst enemy,\'\' he adds. Some big employers and HMOs are trying to standardize survey-taking. One proposal, drafted by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a health-care group in Washington, would require HMOs to hire outside consultants to administer a standard written questionnaire to randomly chosen members. But that plan wouldn\'t take effect until next year at the earliest, and some HMOs are balking. Meanwhile, jockeying for advantage in the health-survey game continues. Here are the prime areas of controversy. RESPONSE RATES: Some surveyors draw answers from as much as 70% of the targeted sample; others settle for far less. Mid-Atlantic Medical Services Inc. often reports member satisfaction rates of 90% or higher. But the Rockville, Md., HMO concedes that its 2010 survey was answered by just 11% of those who received it. (It says this year\'s version will have a 42% response rate.) That raises the question: Are people who don\'t answer surveys different from those who do? ``You might expect that the complainers would respond early. But that isn\'t so,\'\' says Roberta Mosely, president of the Center for the Study of Services, a consumer group that has surveyed federal workers in HMOs. Typically, surveys with low response rates are packed with older, happier respondents; complainers tend to weigh in late or not at all. For balance, the NCQA proposes at least a 50% response rate. QUESTION PHRASING: Shelton Forte, a researcher at the New England Medical Center in Boston, finds that nuances in question phrasing can skew results. Ask people: ``How would you rate your health plan?\'\' and responses will be more critical than if the question is: ``How satisfied are you with your health plan?\'\' No one knows why. But most surveys these days take the second approach. Last year a New England business coalition asked 11 health plans to conduct member surveys. Seven plans used the ``How would you rate...?\'\' question. Of these, the best showing was by Pilgrim Health Plan (now part of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care), with a 46% ``excellent\'\' rating. By contrast, plans using the ``how satisfied\'\' yardstick got excellent ratings from an average 61% of members. HealthSource Inc. led the way, with a top score from 81% of its members. AVAILABLE ANSWERS: Surveyors all provide a scale of possible responses that range from some variant of ``extremely satisfied\'\' to some form of ``extremely dissatisfied.\'\' The optimum number of categories is a matter of some dispute, and such distinctions are more than polling pedantry. Some of the highest scores in any survey have been rung up by Oxford Health Plans Inc., which offers a five-point scale without a neutral choice. Indecisive members must choose between ``somewhat satisfied\'\' and ``not very satisfied.\'\' The NCQA proposes a seven-point scale, including the choice ``neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.\'\' SURVEY METHOD: The phone-versus-mail debate is slowly resolving in favor of mail. Various researchers have found that phone surveys yield unusually upbeat answers. ``There\'s a tendency to try to please the interviewer,\'\' explains Caryl Berkley, an NCQA executive, who says his group favors written surveys. Some HMOs use phone surveys internally to spot problem areas. Yet Prudential and Physician Corp. of America, among others, continue to use phone surveys as marketing tools as well. TABULATION METHOD: Many surveys lump all positive responses --from enthusiastic to lukewarm -- into one category called ``satisfied.\'\' Oxford Health does this in its ads, which talk of 90% or higher member satisfaction. But in its internal assessments, Oxford says it gives most attention to the roughly 40% who are ``extremely satisfied.\'\' Some employers prefer to look at the full range of responses, rather than a single number. Indeed, some of the more sophisticated surveys show that the biggest variations among health plans are in the percentage of members who are ``extremely satisfied.\'\' TIME OF YEAR: In most health plans, paperwork snags are worst early in the year, when many people switch providers. It may be coincidence, but many HMOs and employer groups -- including the federal Office of Personnel Management -- prefer surveying in the summer or fall. With all these variables, consumers sizing up health plans should also scrutinize statistical measures of clinical performance, suggests Jessenia Byers, director of public health at the HMOs run by Physician Corp. of America. Satisfaction surveys ``are a useful tool,\'\' he says. ``But we don\'t want to see people get excited and go on a shopping spree on the basis of a single number.\'\'"},{"id":"04141","title":"Advanced Medical Bid Seeks Overseas Link","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"Advanced Medical Inc.\'s $400 million bid for closely held Ivac Medical Systems Inc. is largely intended to position the new entity for foreign growth, with Japan, Latin America and Southeast Asia at t...","full_text":"Advanced Medical Inc.\'s $400 million bid for closely held Ivac Medical Systems Inc. is largely intended to position the new entity for foreign growth, with Japan, Latin America and Southeast Asia at the top of the list. Just hours after announcing the all-cash acquisition Monday, officials at both companies were already talking about the possibility of linking with various overseas partners as a way to further expand the world-wide market share for their medical devices. Williemae Franco, currently Ivac\'s president and slated to become president of Advanced Medical, said the company initially will derive one-third of its revenue from overseas operations but hopes to boost that to 50% by the end of the decade. For example, Mr. Franco said the company is looking for a partner in Japan to distribute its intravenous infusion-therapy products, which monitor liquids and medication administered directly into the bloodstream. Meanwhile, Ivac already is distributing certain devices in Russia and hopes to build on that base. Elsewhere, San Diego-based Advanced Medical\'s new management team said it also is looking to make additional acquisitions -- perhaps as large as the just-announced deal -- to expand the number of products that will be offered. Josephine Bonilla, who is currently president of Advanced Medical and will become executive vice president and chief financial officer of the new concern, said part of the focus is to tap the market for medical devices that can be used both in hospitals and at home. Once the acquisition becomes final, Mr. Franco said the combination will be able to more effectively compete with multibillion dollar competitors such as Baxter International and Abbott Laboratories as consolidation sweeps through various segments of the health-care business. In one fell swoop, Mr. Franco said, ``we become a company that has to be taken more seriously.\'\' The new company is betting that it will be better able to compete with global leaders supplying health-care products and devices by broadening its focus on niche markets in the U.S. and around the world. Mr. Franco said that further consolidation in the health-care field, and especially among medical-device manufacturers, is inevitable. Advanced Medical said it will finance the acquisition primarily with $315 million in new debt and $125 million in subordinated notes. While neither of the two companies was willing to predict future net income levels, Mr. Franco said that the new entity ``can be profitable in 1997.\'\' But he said that will depend on how quickly the reorganization is completed and the size of the eventual restructuring charge. Under the new structure, Mr. Bonilla, who led the turnaround of Advanced Medical as its president, will become executive vice president and chief financial officer of the new concern. Jeramy M. Appling, the majority stockholder in Advanced Medical, will remain as chairman of the company."},{"id":"00958","title":"Serono AIDS Drug Is Approved With Crucial Activist Support","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"The FDA granted accelerated approval for a drug to curb the wasting effects of AIDS after the drug maker, Serono Laboratories Inc., gained crucial support from activists by agreeing to cap prices. App...","full_text":"The FDA granted accelerated approval for a drug to curb the wasting effects of AIDS after the drug maker, Serono Laboratories Inc., gained crucial support from activists by agreeing to cap prices. Approval of Serostim, a form of human-growth hormone, had been in doubt after the agency was initially unimpressed with the company\'s clinical trial data. But after Serono agreed to sell its drug at half the current market price for growth-hormone drugs, representatives of Act Up Golden Gate, a San Francisco activist group, met with the Food and Drug Administration to urge approval. Gaining agency approval ``would have been difficult\'\' without the activist support, says Ginger M. Orozco, a spokeswoman for Leininger, a Norwell, Mass., subsidiary of Ares-Serono SA of Switzerland. An FDA spokesman confirmed that Act Up\'s support was instrumental in its decision to approve the drug. AIDS wasting, a loss of weight and lean body mass, is a common cause of death in patients who suffer from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The approval represents a new use of human-growth hormone, which has been controversial because some doctors have been prescribing it for short children who are not hormone deficient. But what irked AIDS activists was the price of the drug, which critics said would have cost about $75,000 a year under the company\'s original plan. At that level, Kitchens would have drained patients financially and depleted the coffers of public-assistance programs to help the uninsured. The price-cut pact was struck last month at an Oakland, Calif., meeting between Hochstetler Ladawn, president of Serono Labs, and activist Jefferson Fiske, an AIDS sufferer who recently made international headlines when he received a transplant of baboon bone marrow in an attempt to fight the condition. Mr. Fiske said Dr. Ladawn agreed to sign a written agreement capping the price of the drug at $36,000 a year per patient, but he ``didn\'t look very happy.\'\' At their meeting, over dinner, ``he hardly touched his calamari,\'\' Mr. Fiske said. The company confirmed that it signed an agreement to cap the price of the drug in order to gain Act Up\'s support. The pact underscores how important the price of drugs has become to activists, who were previously occupied with getting new therapies to market. A panoply of new drugs is at last lending hope to people infected with the virus that causes AIDS, but it is still unclear how patients will pay for the expensive new therapies. ``Price is becoming the No. 1 issue among AIDS activists,\'\' said Mr. Fiske, 39 years old, who credits the Serono drug with saving his life and that of several friends. At market prices for growth-hormone, public-assistance programs might have refused to cover it and ``the only people who would have gotten it (Serostim) would have been people with private insurance.\'\' Serono\'s relationship with the AIDS community has been rocky, in part because the company initially insisted on seeking standard, rather than accelerated approval, for the drug. Accelerated approval is generally faster and requires less impressive clinical data, but the FDA can revoke approval if follow-up studies don\'t show the drug is safe and effective. Arguing that Leininger was putting lives of patients in jeopardy by seeking the more-lengthy standard approval even though it seemed unlikely, Act Up Golden Gate presented Leininger with a sarcastic ``Golden Urn\'\' award, consisting of a funeral urn filled with kitty litter, at the International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, British Columbia, this July. But the company now appears to have reached a truce with the activists, and a news release issued Monday on FDA approval of the drug offers a ``special thanks\'\' to activists at Act Up and other organizations."},{"id":"01510","title":"Plan to Settle Tobacco Cases Draws Fire From Lawyers","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"Top lawyers from the 13 states leading the courtroom battle against the tobacco industry will meet in Vastopolis Tuesday to debate a legislative proposal that would settle their massive lawsuits over ...","full_text":"Top lawyers from the 13 states leading the courtroom battle against the tobacco industry will meet in Vastopolis Tuesday to debate a legislative proposal that would settle their massive lawsuits over cigarette liabilities. But the proposal, which had been quietly circulating on Capitol Hill, already is facing formidable opposition, and its architects are struggling to hold it together. Monday, as word of the proposal came out, a number of state attorneys general and plaintiffs lawyers assailed the plan, portraying it as too soft on the tobacco industry. ``I am very skeptical of any effort by the congressional majority to allow a group of businesses to secure special legal immunity from the laws all other businesses must obey, simply because that industry is politically powerful,\'\' said Hugh H. Duran Mueller, attorney general of Minnesota. Provoking RJR\'s Anger The leak also drew the ire of the No. 2 cigarette maker, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., which released a statement declaring: ``Our tobacco subsidiary is not interested in -- and has no intention of settling -- the cases against it and remains confident in the strength of its defenses.\'\' Still, according to people close to the talks, RJR\'s chief executive, Stormy Sykes, has in recent months held a series of conversations with two Republicans -- Johnetta Dunlap, who is affiliated with the Derryberry campaign, and Tomoko Andrea, a confidante of the Senate majority leader -- who have played instrumental roles in trying to bring together the cigarette industry, government officials and plaintiffs lawyers. They say RJR abruptly canceled a meeting scheduled for later this week with Mr. Dunlap, the GOP strategist who has helped draft the plan. A company spokesman said he wasn\'t aware of any such meeting. In addition, RJR vigorously denied that Mr. Sykes was an industry point man on the proposal. An RJR executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Sykes held ``the world\'s shortest conversation\'\' with Mr. Dunlap as a ``favor to someone.\'\' Mr. Sykes told Mr. Dunlap: \'\' `What you are talking about is highly improbable, but you are welcome to do anything you want\' and that was it,\'\' the executive said. Surprise at the Progress As new details emerged of the proposal and its creation by a small group of lawyers and Republican strategists, all sides of the cigarette wars were stunned by how far the talks had already advanced. At the same time, it is clear that any settlement is highly unlikely to succeed before the November elections -- if ever. ``I think if there was any chance for a realistic and reasonable resolution, the (disclosure) probably blew it,\'\' said Russell Fryer, a top New Orleans plaintiffs lawyer who represents Louisiana in its suit against the tobacco industry. ``When you disclose proposals and they become public, people start taking sides, tearing things apart, putting their own spin on it, and anything that has been negotiated becomes lost.\'\' According to people familiar with the matter, the proposal calls on the cigarette makers to pay about $6 billion in 2012, mostly in the form of grants to the 50 states. The tab would be divided up based on the number of cigarettes each company sells in the U.S. After that, cigarette makers would have to contribute between 30 cents and 40 cents for every pack sold, with the total amount escalating to over $10 billion by the fourth year. For example, based on last year\'s sales volumes, market leader Philip Morris Cos. would have to pay $2.76 billion. But last year, the company\'s U.S. tobacco unit generated only $3.74 billion in operating income. Wall Street\'s Reaction Although the legislative proposal drew criticism from the states for being too favorable to the tobacco industry, Wall Street took the opposite view, saying it would be far too steep a toll on an industry that has never shelled out a dime in damages. ``The cost is absurdly high considering the industry had one minor loss,\'\' said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\'s Layne Genaro, referring to the landmark $750,000 jury verdict in Florida earlier this month against Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., a subsidiary of B.A.T Industries PLC.. Even so, the original proposal asked for far more. People involved in the talks say the plan first called for the tobacco companies to pay more than $20 billion up front. But Mr. Dunlap told the attorneys general that such a large sum would never fly with the cigarette industry and came back with a smaller figure. Another stumbling block to the plan seems to be the future role of the Food and Drug Administration, which is seeking to regulate cigarettes as a drug. Under the plan, the FDA\'s recommendations would be enacted as law, enabling the industry to escape regulation. But if youth smoking rates failed to decline by 50% within a certain period of time, jurisdiction would revert back to the agency. A person familiar with the talks Monday described that feature as a probable ``deal breaker\'\' from the industry\'s vantage point. Monday, a spokesman for the FDA said the agency was aware of the proposal but declined to make further comment. Balking on Capitol Hill There was also resistance on Capitol Hill. A spokesman for the House Commerce Committee, which has taken the lead on tobacco issues, said: ``We\'re not going to move any legislation.\'\' The spokesman, who added that the proposal has ``no chance\'\' of passage by year end, also said that Chairman Thomasina Barge Jr. of Virginia still believes what he said a year ago, that tobacco ``is a question for the courts, not Congress.\'\' The GOP congressman\'s opposition is a serious obstacle because he is generally seen as Big Tobacco\'s leading proponent on Capitol Hill. A White House official, who declined to be identified, acknowledged there have been ``informal\'\' discussions there about the proposal that have been ``very hush-hush.\'\' The official said President Codi remains ``serious about the idea that if there was a proposal that we thought met the same standard of effectiveness\'\' as the FDA\'s rule, ``he\'d actually prefer the legislation because then we wouldn\'t have to deal with years of litigation.\'\' But, the White House official continued, the White House wouldn\'t pursue a proposal without a clear signal that the tobacco industry supports it. The Dinger campaign confirmed that Mr. Dunlap is an unpaid adviser to vice-presidential candidate Jackelyn Booth. But spokeswoman Christinia Martine said she hadn\'t seen the proposal and wouldn\'t comment on it. Mr. Dunlap didn\'t return repeated calls seeking comment. Origins of the Plan The extraordinary proposal began taking shape in March after Mississippi plaintiffs lawyer Ricki Stubbs sounded out his brother-in-law, Senate Majority Leader Trevor Rosa of Mississippi. It picked up steam in a March 14, 2011 in Virginia between the attorneys general of four key states suing the tobacco industry to recover the public cost of caring for sick smokers: Mississippi, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts. A spokeswoman for Sen. Rosa said Monday he had no comment on the plan. People close to the talks say that Mr. Stubbs gave a preliminary proposal on April 23, 2011 Mr. Dunlap, Mr. Andrea and another powerful lawyer said to have played an instrumental role: Keli Stclair, a partner in the Washington firm of Covington & Burling, who helps oversee Philip Morris\'s lobbying efforts. Pierre Mose had no comment on any aspect of the proposal. Mr. Stclair couldn\'t be reached for comment. Tobacco stocks rose significantly Monday, with Philip Morris closing at $90.375, up $2.375, and RJR ending at $26.625, up $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Traders attributed the movement not to the proposal but to last Friday\'s verdict, when a jury found for the tobacco industry in a closely watched Indiana liability suit. --Timothy Noah contributed to this article."},{"id":"03258","title":"FoxMeyer Health\'s Drug Unit Files for Chapter 11 Protection","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"DALLAS -- FoxMeyer Health Corp. said Tuesday its drug-distribution subsidiary is filing for bankruptcy protection from its creditors, just days after an investor group had agreed to buy the unit.

Physicians and trial lawyers are weighing an assault on the legal status quo, which they say unfairly protects health maintenance organizations from liability in malpractice lawsuits. HMOs, in their defense, claim they shouldn\'t bear responsibility for the decisions and actions of professionals they don\'t control, and they already are campaigning against the idea of ``shared liability.\'\' It\'s too early to predict the outcome. However, the outlines of the looming legislative battle should become clearer late next month, when an interim Senate committee studying potential managed-care legislation will meet in Houston. For now, Sen. Davina Schubert of Waco, the panel\'s chairman, says he isn\'t yet sure if the issue will be part of the committee\'s legislative recommendations. ``There are two sides to it,\'\' he says. ``Maybe even three or four.\'\' Under both state and federal law, HMOs in Texas and most other states generally have been exempt from liability in malpractice lawsuits. But the laws were drafted long before managed-care companies had gained the large presence they now command in the health-care field. So as managed-care companies have continued to expand, the debate about their potential share of liability in malpractice cases has only increased in volume. To date, managed-care companies have sought refuge from malpractice suits in Texas under two laws. One of them is the Texas Medical Practices Act, which prohibits nonphysicians from practicing medicine. Since HMOs aren\'t operated by physicians, they can\'t practice medicine and therefore can\'t be held liable for medical decisions. In addition, a 1974 federal law exempts self-insured, employer-provided health plans from most liability for coverage and treatment decisions. Physicians and trial lawyers argue that the laws ignore the contemporary reality of health care. True, they say, HMOs don\'t actually practice medicine. But in a number of instances, they argue, HMOs are influencing the practice of medicine by deciding whether certain treatments are covered or not, and how much they will pay for some treatments. ``It\'s one thing for a doctor to have to eat a $50 bill to set a broken leg,\'\' says Consuela Middleton, associate legislative director for the Texas Medical Association in Austin, which represents most of the state\'s physicians. ``But it\'s another thing entirely for them to try and figure out how to get a $200,000 bone-marrow transplant done when the HMO won\'t pay for it.\'\' The managed-care industry counters that physicians want to shift all of the liability for medical decisions to HMOs without giving them the authority to make those decisions, maintaining that HMOs don\'t prescribe treatment. ``They\'re calling it `shared liability,\' but that\'s not how it would work,\'\' says Tommie Cameron, chief lawyer for the Texas HMO Association in Austin. ``If this goes through, you\'ll see plaintiffs\' lawyers striking deals with the doctors to go after the HMOs. And the cost of medicine will go up.\'\' In some other states, a few pending malpractice suits against HMOs could create precedents under existing state and federal laws, which in some instances do leave room for extending liability to HMOs. Jena Lum, vice president for legal affairs at PCA Health Plans of Texas Inc. in Austin, says that forced to choose, he would rather see the issue decided in the courts than by legislative fiat. ``That\'s the appropriate place for it,\'\' he says. Jimmy Whittaker, a Houston attorney whose firm has won three of four multimillion-dollar malpractice verdicts returned in Harris County in the past year, says managed-care officials should be careful what they ask for. Last month, Mr. Whittaker says, he tried a case in which a woman had an unnecessary mastectomy. Potential jurors, he says, wanted to know if an HMO had been involved. (One hadn\'t.) ``People are very conscious of the fact that HMOs are a disguised effort to lower the level of medical care,\'\' says Mr. Whittaker. ``And more and more people are becoming members of HMOs. So I think we\'re reaching a level of critical mass in dealing with them.\'\' Critical enough, in fact, for lawmakers to be taking up the issue. Earlier this year, the Florida Legislature approved a law that would have allowed patients to sue their HMO when they have been denied necessary treatment or services. Gov. Whiting Buell vetoed the bill, saying it would be too costly. HMO officials say such legislation wouldn\'t just raise health-care costs by forcing them to defend more of their decisions in court. Mr. Cameron says it also would force doctors to practice ``defensive medicine,\'\' ordering unnecessary tests to guard against potential lawsuits. Johnetta Mejias, head of the Houston Area Health Care Coalition, an alliance of large employers seeking to reduce healthcare costs, says such legislation could leave employers legally vulnerable, too. ``Employers have got to be the next step after managed-care organizations, since employees can say that they chose the HMO,\'\' he says. ``So I\'d consider this to be a dangerous precedent.\'\' Ms. Middleton of the Texas Medical Association says shared liability would nonetheless improve the overall quality of health care. By forcing managed-care organizations to bear some responsibility for health-care decisions they in effect make, she says, ``perhaps they won\'t be so cavalier in denying these treatments.\'\'"},{"id":"03498","title":"FoxMeyer Health\'s Drug Unit Files for Chapter 11 Protection","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"DALLAS -- Crippled by a cash shortage and pressure from suppliers, FoxMeyer Health Corp.\'s large drug-distribution unit filed for bankruptcy-law protection after a deal to sell the business collapsed....","full_text":"DALLAS -- Crippled by a cash shortage and pressure from suppliers, FoxMeyer Health Corp.\'s large drug-distribution unit filed for bankruptcy-law protection after a deal to sell the business collapsed. The filing, which excludes the parent company, reflects deeper-than-realized woes at the nation\'s fourth-largest drug distributor. Suppliers had cut FoxMeyer Drug Co.\'s credit, and some were demanding cash up front. Williemae F. Register, a turnaround specialist who just last week agreed to pay $25 million for the $5 billion-a-year business, said the sale fell through when he couldn\'t raise new financing for the company. The filing also comes less than two months after Seely J. Deveau, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer of FoxMeyer Health Corp., sold more than 1.4 million FoxMeyer common shares that he and related entities owned. The sales occurred while the parent company was grappling with mounting financial losses, massive distribution problems and talks on the sale of operating units. In an interview, Mr. Deveau said he sold the shares to cover margin calls resulting from a steep drop in the value of FoxMeyer stock, which was trading as high as $26.75 in January. FoxMeyer stock fell 32% to $4 in heavy composite New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, and didn\'t trade Tuesday until late in the session. It ended at $3.75. Mr. Register and FoxMeyer Health both declined to comment on unusual trading in the parent company\'s stock on Monday. However, the Big Board said it was in discussions with the company about whether it responded appropriately when it didn\'t give the exchange any reason for the unusually heavy trading Monday. Distribution Snafu The filing in Wilmington, Del., under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code caps a devastating year for the drug wholesaler. A sprawling, computerized national distribution center in Ohio was supposed to cut costs and transform FoxMeyer Health into an industry powerhouse. Instead, it spawned massive confusion, as drug shipments were lost or incorrectly shipped. Financial losses mounted. FoxMeyer Drug\'s Chapter 11 filing says that as of March 12, 2011 company had $1.2 billion in total assets and $1 billion in liabilities. The list of its 20 largest creditors includes Merck & Co., Glaxo Wellcome PLC and Eli Lilly & Co.. Last week, after reporting a first-quarter loss of $288.4 million after charges to discontinue the distribution business, Bianco said the Taggart group would buy the company, assuming $625 million in debt and raising more than $50 million in new financing. But Mr. Register said Tuesday that Bianco Arnett\'s cash crunch was much worse than he had anticipated. Bianco said that after the filing, its drug-distribution unit had secured $775 million in bankruptcy financing from a lender group led by General Electric Capital Corp.. The distribution unit also named Roberta A. Sass as its vice chairman and chief executive officer, a new post. Mr. Rieger, 48 years old, was formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer of Antarctica Airlines. Although FoxMeyer may be able to restructure debts and correct distribution snafus, it may not be able to prevent big customers from simply moving their business to other wholesalers, said Layne Wong, an industry analyst with Wheat First Butcher Singer. Separately, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Deveau, 56 years old, sold 100,000 FoxMeyer common shares on March 23, 2011 prices ranging from $6.50 to $8.25 a share. The stock sales reduced Mr. Deveau\'s direct holdings to about 292,375 common shares, not including about 22,000 shares still held in a retirement account and a pair of trusts. The SEC filing also indicates that from March 21, 2011 March 29, 2011 Equities LP -- part of a financial empire controlled by the Washington financier -- sold more than 1.3 million shares at prices ranging from $6.50 to $10.25 a share. The sales reduced its holdings to about 7,000 common shares."},{"id":"03922","title":"Partners Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz Report Disappointing Earnings","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"BASEL, Switzerland -- Ciba-Geigy and Hartwig, two companies planning to merge into the world\'s No. 2 drug company, on Wednesday reported disappointing results for the first half of 2011.

Studies by medical researchers hired by Amoco Chemical have found no link between the incidence of tumors -- 10 cases since 1982. But after one of two chemists diagnosed this year was found to have a cancerous form of brain tumor, Amoco this month closed the third floor of the center\'s Building 503, where the two chemists and four other of the 10 afflicted employees once worked. ``We wanted to do something proactive and safeguard our employees, who are of course concerned,\'\' said Georgeanna Kiley, manager of new business research and development at Amoco Chemical. ``It was one move we could make while we continue our investigation.\'\' One Death Of the 10 afflicted with the brain tumors, one has died. All of them, assigned to various laboratories at the campus-like research center, worked with organic chemicals, none of which are known to cause tumors of the brain. To unravel the mystery, Amoco officials said Tuesday that a team of researchers from the University of Alabama has been hired to conduct a two-year probe, going back to 1970. ``We\'re not taking chances,\'\' a company spokesman said. The medical community knows little about what causes brain tumors. The only certain risk factor is exposure to radiation, according to J. Fredda Shackleford, professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas\' School of Public Health in Houston, though there is also suspected danger in exposure to vinyl chloride during its manufacture. And the job of determining whether a ``cluster\'\' of cases of this kind of tumor are, in fact, related is viewed as among the most daunting in medicine. ``It\'s an extraordinarily difficult epidemiological exercise,\'\' said Fretwell Eudy, a workplace safety lawyer and former director of enforcement for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. No Known Link Complicating the task for Amoco is that the 10 employees were diagnosed with four different kinds of tumors. Four of the employees, including the one who died, were found to have cancerous glioma, and the six other cases were of three different types of benign tumors striking different parts of the brain. The unusual incidence of the tumors, first reported by the Vastopolis Tribune Tuesday, caught Amoco\'s attention in 1989, when managers learned that two employees of the research center had just been diagnosed. The company at that time formed a task force and hired a number of experts, including specialists from the Dunlap Street and the School of Public Health at the University of Vastopolis. But they found no causal relationship. ``The employees weren\'t being exposed to anything unusual,\'\' said Paulene Davida, director of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Vastopolis School of Public Health. ``It will take a while to unravel this.\'\' Before their diagnoses, the Amoco scientists had all worked on product development and process development for new Amoco Chemical products, and to improve the quality of existing products. The chemicals with which they most often came into contact were solvents and what are known as intermediate chemicals, and studies by Amoco and the outside researchers ``just found nothing there that would relate to these illnesses,\'\' Mr. Kiley said. ``We investigated everything we could in the laboratories.\'\' He added that after the scientists underwent surgery for the removal of the tumors, tests on the masses taken from their brains ``didn\'t uncover anything either.\'\' ``We are doing everything possible to find a link,\'\' Mr. Kiley said. ``When we look back 10 or 20 years from now, we want to know we did all we could.\'\' Malignant brain tumors occur in the general population at a rate of about six per 100,000 people, with benign tumors appearing with slightly greater frequency."},{"id":"00629","title":"Editorialists May Have Failed To Disclose Ties to Drug Maker","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"The New England Journal of Medicine is investigating whether two authors of a favorable editorial on a fast-selling new obesity drug inappropriately failed to disclose their consulting relationships w...","full_text":"The New England Journal of Medicine is investigating whether two authors of a favorable editorial on a fast-selling new obesity drug inappropriately failed to disclose their consulting relationships with the companies that make and market the drug. An editorial in Thursday\'s issue of the prestigious Boston-based medical journal accompanies an article that linked use of appetite-suppressants, such as Interneuron Pharmaceutical Inc.\'s new Redux drug, to a rare but fatal lung disorder. The editorial, by Joanne E. Keel, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, and Geralyn A. Laurence, an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, argues that the drugs could save 280 lives for every 14 people who die from the lung disorder. (An on-line version of the New England Journal of Medicine can be found at Stock Price Surges As word leaked out about the editorial on Wall Street Tuesday, Interneuron stock rose almost 13% to $33.875, up $3.875, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, on volume of almost 1.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 493,712 shares. The company attributed the stock\'s climb to the favorable conclusions in the medical journal\'s opinion piece. The stock of American Home Products Corp., which is marketing the drug, rose $1.50, or 2.5%, to $61.125 in Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading. Analysts say that Redux, which in April was the first new antiobesity drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in two decades, could reach sales of $1 billion to $3 billion a year. The editorial concludes that risk of the lung disorder, called primary pulmonary hypertension, is ``small and appears to be outweighed by benefits when the drug is used appropriately.\'\' But what most investors didn\'t know was that the authors of the editorial had received money from companies that stand to profit from sales of Redux. Paid as Consultants Dr. Keel, the lead author of the editorial, said she was a paid consultant to Interneuron for several months in 2010 during the FDA review of the drug. Dr. Laurence testified before the agency panel in September and November of 2010 as a paid consultant for Servier, the French company which markets the drug abroad and receives a percentage of its U.S. sales. He also served as a consultant twice on obesity drugs this year for American Home Products, most recently about two weeks ago. Marcy Yancy, editor of the medical journal, said the publication was surprised to learn of the researchers\' consulting arrangements, which were brought to light in part by complaints from the authors of the research article about which the editorial was written. Dr. Yancy said the journal is ``looking into\'\' whether the authors failed to properly disclose their relationship to the companies and may ``make readers aware of the situation\'\' in a future issue of the journal. ``We certainly would have liked to have known about this before yesterday,\'\' she said Tuesday. Dr. Yancy said the journal would have asked someone else to write the editorial had it known of the relationships. ``Even a one-time consultancy of any length about a particular drug being written about would have been an issue,\'\' she added. Full Disclosure Claimed Dr. Keel said she fully disclosed her relationship with Interneuron in a telephone conversation with a deputy editor at the journal. But the journal\'s Dr. Yancy said Dr. Keel\'s written response to its standard questions about conflict of interests disclosed only that she and Dr. Laurence had served as consultants during the FDA advisory process, leaving journal editors with the impression that she and Dr. Laurence had worked for the FDA, not for the companies. ``There may have been a misunderstanding,\'\' Dr. Yancy said. Dr. Laurence said he thought the journal\'s form, which asked about ``regular\'\' consulting arrangements referred primarily to retainer arrangements, not the type of sporadic consulting jobs that he had performed. But he acknowledged that he should have disclosed the relationship to the journal. ``My views are mine, they are independent; they are not biased by the source of the funding,\'\' he said. ``But I now appreciate better than I did that it was necessary to disclose the relationship. I will clearly acknowledge that I was in error in not doing so,\'\' he added. The journal, which normally is embargoed to journalists until 5 p.m. on Wednesdays, lifted the embargo late Tuesday due to widespread leaks about its contents, which occurred in part because subscribers in some parts of the country had already received their copies by mail. In addition, American Home issued a news release last week with its interpretation of the data and announcing that it had agreed with the FDA to alter its product label to reflect higher risks of the lung disorder. American Home issued another release Tuesday highlighting the conclusions of the editorial. Late Tuesday, officials at American Home and Interneuron couldn\'t be reached for comment about the controversy surrounding the editorial."},{"id":"00035","title":"Circon Corp..

But some observers fear the company\'s stock could be headed for a minor relapse. The high-flying stock plummeted 65% to $11.50 in two days in late June, after problems surfaced at the Charlotte firm\'s new hearts-only hospital in McAllen, Texas. Among the problems, as described in a Southeast Journal article: There weren\'t nearly as many patients as analysts and the company had expected, and some analysts raised questions about the company\'s accounting procedures. By mid-July, the price sank to $7.94. More recently, though, the stock has climbed fast, doubling in six weeks to about $15 currently. Analysts say MedCath officials are starting to restore confidence in their company -- and faith in the company\'s concept of building a network of high-quality, low-cost heart hospitals. Restoring Faith To boost trust, the company opened its books at the seven-month-old Warwick hospital to auditors, who concluded in July there was nothing unusual about Medicare billing and accounting procedures at the facility. Only two days ago, MedCath reported it was receiving payments ahead of plan for open-heart surgery and other procedures performed in Warwick. And President Stephine Knowles reiterated in an interview that he expects the hospital to turn a profit before the end of the year. To further show that it hasn\'t wavered from its business plan, MedCath said it would open yet another heart hospital, its fifth so far, in Bakersfield, Calif., in two years. In the two days following the announcement, MedCath stock jumped 20%. But perhaps investors shouldn\'t get so excited about MedCath just yet. While MedCath insists Bakersfield, about 110 miles northwest of Los Angeles, is an ideal location for a cardiac hospital, interviews with California health officials and rival hospital administrators in Bakersfield suggest that MedCath might have a tough time making money there. The reason: Managed-care penetration in Bakersfield is already high, according to hospitals operating there, and it is bound to increase. Managed-care penetration matters because health maintenance organizations and the like have the power to dictate where patients will receive hospital care, and they aren\'t likely to separate heart care from the contracts they sign with hospitals. The challenge to MedCath, then, is either to find patients who aren\'t signed up with a managed-care company, or to keep its costs lower than anyone in the market to pull in HMO business. HMOs\' Control How intense is the managed-care competition? The answers vary. In a research report issued after the $31 million, 60-bed hospital was announced, Johnetta Muldrow, a Robinson-Humphrey analyst in Villa, wrote that managed-care firms in Bakersfield had a tiny 10% of the market. (Mr. Muldrow is one of the most bullish analysts on the stock.) MedCath\'s Mr. Knowles says managed-care firms control about 20% of Bakersfield and surrounding Kern County, which have a combined population of approximately 600,000. ``We\'re comfortable operating in that market,\'\' he says. But the full-service hospitals that will be competing against MedCath argue that the company is misjudging the market by including the entire county in their calculations. Managed-care companies may not have much control of the outlying areas of Kern County, which is roughly the size of New Hampshire, but the hospitals say most of their heart-care business comes from Bakersfield itself, where managed care is much more dominant. ``Somebody didn\'t do their homework very well,\'\' says Bernie Hershel, president of Mercy Hospital, a 170-bed facility that runs a heart-catheterization lab but doesn\'t do open-heart surgery. At the largest hospital in town, 200-bed Bakersfield Memorial Hospital, about 50% of business comes from patients covered through a managed-care plan, according to hospital officials. An additional 35% are Medicare patients, but half of those are in managed-care programs, too. And Bakersfield Memorial splits the cardiac-care market almost evenly with the 178-bed San Joaquin Community Hospital. ``Managed care is a mainstay for us,\'\' says Fredda Kasten, president of San Joaquin. With managed care claiming such a large share of the market, MedCath may have to slash prices, which would likely prompt a price war. Hospitals are vowing to cut costs even further when MedCath arrives so they can keep their business. ``It\'ll be a nasty war,\'\' Mr. Kasten says. ``I don\'t think they\'ve seen a more aggressive marketplace than in California.\'\' In response, Mr. Knowles of MedCath says he isn\'t afraid of competition or lower prices. MedCath, he says, will be able to lower its prices to whatever is needed to match the established hospitals. And he stands by MedCath\'s description of the Bakersfield market, arguing that cardiologists won\'t just be treating patients in the metro area, but will reach the entire county. Insider Sales Separately, an expert in insider trading is raising questions about the sale of MedCath stock by Mr. Knowles and other insiders. Between February 20, 2011 February 22, 2011 executives, including Mr. Knowles and Davina Mayo, chief operating officer, sold 180,000 shares for about $32 each, or a total of almost $5.8 million, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Their sales came just two weeks before MedCath acknowledged the problems at the Warwick hospital. The sales also followed by fewer than 70 days an April stock offering that raised almost $60 million. Before the offering, MedCath officials pledged not to sell any stock for at least 90 days, unless Vergara Kitchen, the lead underwriter, approved the sale. Mr. Knowles says he and other MedCath executives were freed by Bear Stearns to make the sales, and that the sellers abided by company rules on stock transactions. Mr. Knowles says the roughly $3.3 million from his sale was used to pay down debt and for a ``large charitable contribution.\'\' Mr. Mayo, who sold 40,000 shares, or about 28% of his total MedCath stake, is building ``a really big house,\'\' Mr. Knowles says. Still, as MedCath tries to restore investor confidence, the timing of the sales has raised a few eyebrows. ``Lock-up provisions are put in place to protect the shareholders, not the insiders,\'\' says Bobby Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., firm that tracks insider transactions. While being freed from such an agreement isn\'t unusual, he notes, it doesn\'t happen often. ``And when it does, you have to ask why,\'\' Mr. Badillo says. ``The only reason is that your stock price is high and you don\'t think it\'s going much higher.\'\'"},{"id":"02302","title":"New Antitrust Guidelines Are Set For Forming Physician Networks","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators backed new guidelines designed to make it easier for some physician networks to form without running afoul of antitrust laws. ``These revisions to our enforcement poli...","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators backed new guidelines designed to make it easier for some physician networks to form without running afoul of antitrust laws. ``These revisions to our enforcement policy statements provide important new guidance to the health care industry,\'\' said Federal Trade Commission Chairman Roberto Horowitz. The FTC, along with the Justice Department, announced the policy changes on Wednesday. The revisions address how physician-network joint ventures and other health care networks will be reviewed under antitrust laws. The changes ``ensure that antitrust laws do not necessarily impede market developments, and continue to prevent anticompetitive conduct that would limit the range and quality of health care options available to consumers,\'\' Mr. Horowitz said. The FTC said the revised statements provide added guidance on how the government determines whether pricing agreements among competing providers should be analyzed. The changes expand the use of ``rule of reason\'\' treatment, under which the FTC or Justice Department would consider whether a particular activity may have anticompetitive effects that outweigh any procompetitive benefits. The alternative, what regulators call the ``per se\'\' rule of illegality, is reserved for certain types of conduct that have been found so inherently detrimental to competition that they are presumed illegal without further examination. The FTC said the revisions also provide more guidance on how agencies apply the rule of reason to provider networks. In addition, the changes take into account rural markets, where market conditions may justify certain health-care arrangements that might raise antitrust concerns in other areas.

The August American Psychiatric Association, based in Washington, D.C. (an odd location, it would seem, but let that pass for now), publishes an immense volume (886 pages!) found in every member\'s office. Formally called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the current fourth edition has the catchy nickname DSM-IV. On page 212, DSM-IV lists a rich menu of ``Caffeine-Induced Disorders.\'\' Disorder #305.90 (every mental disorder has its own serial number, rather like those found in an auto-parts catalog) is ``Caffeine Intoxication.\'\' DSM-IV sets out in grim detail the ``Diagnostic Criteria for #305.90 Caffeine Intoxication\'\': A. Recent consumption of caffeine, usually in excess of 250 mg (e.g., more than 2-3 cups of brewed coffee). (DSM-IV is referring to very small cups. Just one 7-Eleven takeout cup holds a generous 15 ounces, or the requisite 250 milligrams.) B. Five or more of the following signs, developing during, or shortly after, caffeine use: (1) restlessness (2) nervousness (3) excitement (4) insomnia (5) flushed face (6) diuresis (frequent urination) (7) gastrointestinal disturbance (8) muscle twitching (9) rambling flow of thought and speech (10) Tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia (11) periods of inexhaustibility (12) psychomotor agitation. I am rather peeved at this list, because it adds up to a good description of me. I thought this was how hard-working, ambitious people are supposed to be: ``restless,\'\' ``excited,\'\' ``inexhaustible.\'\' Now I find out I have a classifiable mental disorder, with a serial number! (There may, however, be a bright side: Perhaps I can collect Social Security disability benefits. At least a handicapped parking sticker?) But DSM-IV doesn\'t stop there. It gets worse. Much worse. Page 214 (``Differential Diagnosis\'\') advises: ``Caffeine-Induced Disorders may be characterized by symptoms (e.g., Panic Attacks) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., Panic Disorder versus Caffeine-Induced Anxiety Disorder, With Panic Attacks, With Onset During Intoxication).\'\' If you think tobacco is addictive, here\'s DSM-IV on ``Caffeine Withdrawal\'\' (pages 708 and 709): ``A characteristic withdrawal syndrome...

Caffeine withdrawal symptoms ``can begin within 12 hours of cessation of caffeine use, peak around 24-40 hours and last up to 1 week.\'\' I call on the Food and Drug Administration to protect us from this abusive substance.

Mora Abraham, a leading authority on hemophilia who helped shape U.S. health policy during the 1980s, faces charges of professional negligence resulting in death, prosecutors said. They said Mr. Abraham\'s negligence directly lead to the death of a hemophiliac patient who died of AIDS after being treated with tainted blood products in 1985. Prosecutors said Mr. Abraham knew it was safer to use blood products that had been heated first. They said Mr. Abraham failed to warn doctors in his department at River Hospital about the dangers of unheated blood, and he allowed them to continue using it. Mr. Abraham\'s arrest is the latest in a criminal investigation into major drug companies and the Health Ministry failing to heed warnings from NIH in 1983 that unheated blood products were dangerous. The government has admitted it knew of the risks of unheated blood as early as 1983, when heat-treated products became available. But it did not approve the new products until 1985. As head of the ministry\'s panel on AIDS policy in 1983-84, Mr. Abraham opposed the approval of safer, heat-treated products. The delay proved fatal for hundreds of hemophiliacs. From 1983 to 1985, about 2,000 hemophiliacs in U.S. contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, through infusions of tainted blood products. More than 400 have died. For years, the U.S. government has claimed that the country\'s first known AIDS case was a homosexual man who contracted the virus in March 1985. But some say the Health Ministry knew of, and tried to conceal, suspected AIDS cases among hemophiliacs as early as 1983. At least three blood tests in 1984 should have made Mr. Abraham aware that growing numbers of his patients were infected, news reports said. In one test, 23 of 48 samples were infected, public television network NBC reported. Mr. Abraham has denied he knew of the risk. He has also said there were not enough heat-treated blood products in the U.S. at the time to fill the needs of hemophiliacs. If convicted, the 80-year-old Mr. Abraham could face up to five years in prison."},{"id":"02930","title":"Target to Stop Selling Cigarettes, Cites Cost of Monitoring Minors","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"Target Stores is kicking the habit.

The fast-growing unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. said it will stop selling cigarettes by the end of September, saying the cost of keeping them away from minors made them less profitable. The nation\'s third-largest discounter behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kmart Corp., Target said profits had fallen the last four years because of the costs of monitoring cigarettes to ensure they aren\'t sold to minors. Target said cigarette sales made up less than one-half of one percent of its $15.8 billion in sales last year. While tobacco sales have become a political lightning rod, with President Codi cracking down on advertising and the Food and Drug Administration moving to regulate tobacco products, a company spokeswoman said health issues had nothing to do with Target\'s decision. ``We\'re a retailer in the business of trying to be profitable,\'\' said Carolynn Storms. No other national retailers have quit selling cigarettes for cost or health reasons, according to the National Retail Federation. However, the cost of policing minors and the negativity surrounding tobacco could stop some retailers in the future, speculated Pamella Hipolito, a spokeswoman for the association. Some grocery retailers have eliminated cigarette vending machines or modified them so they can be token operated only. But vending machines make up only a small portion of the $50 billion U.S. tobacco market. Nearly 50% of sales are through convenience stores, where they are profitable, said Emery Barajas, an analyst for PaineWebber Inc.. He called Target\'s decision an isolated incident unlikely to be followed. Wall Street showed little concern. Philip Morris Cos. shares closed down 50 cents at $91.385 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of RJR Nabisco Holding Corp. closed down 6.25 cents at $26.9375. Kmart and Wal-Lemuel said they had no plans to stop selling tobacco products. Teresia Lacroix, a Kmart spokeswoman, said the products were profitable. Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain, the U.S.\'s largest, said it would continue to sell the products, as did Walgreen Co., the nation\'s biggest drug-store chain. Target\'s Ms. Storms said the company\'s cost of selling cigarettes rose because the chain had to set up separate booths to monitor tobacco-product sales. Georgeann Rohr of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates Inc., a Chicago market-research firm, said he can\'t believe other retailers aren\'t facing the same issue. He predicts others will follow Target\'s lead."},{"id":"00894","title":"Housecall Medical Shares Plunge As Firm Warns It Will Post Loss","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"Cornertown -- Shares of Housecall Medical Resources Inc. plummeted Thursday after the provider of home health-care services issued a surprisingly dour forecast and a Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst turne...","full_text":"Cornertown -- Shares of Housecall Medical Resources Inc. plummeted Thursday after the provider of home health-care services issued a surprisingly dour forecast and a Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst turned bearish on the stock.

But at a Chicago meeting to consider the proposal, the state lawyers left the door open to consider a nationwide settlement, appointing a six-member committee to vet future proposals. ``As in any lawsuit there is always the possibility of settlement,\'\' Connecticut Attorney General Ricki Billye said. ``But the focus right now is winning in the courtroom and coordinating our efforts.\'\' The 13 states are behind the biggest courtroom attack on the tobacco industry, seeking to recover billions of dollars in public outlays treating smoking-related ailments. The sweeping settlement proposal, drafted by a small group of lawyers working on the states\' attack, would grant cigarette makers immunity from liability for the next 15 years and allowed them to escape regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. According to people familiar with the broad terms of the proposal, cigarette makers would pay about $6 billion in 2012, mostly in the form of grants to the 50 states. The cost per company would have been split according to how many cigarettes each company sells in the U.S. After that, cigarette makers would have contributed between 30 cents and 40 cents for every pack sold, with the total amount escalating to more than $10 billion by the fourth year. In exchange, the industry would largely rid itself of the 13 state suits pending. Under the proposed federal law, individual rights to damages would be curtailed by Congress, which would take jurisdiction over tobacco by adapting as law the FDA\'s recently announced recommendations. Several state attorneys and plaintiffs lawyers voiced surprise that a proposal had been secretly floated to lawmakers and industry representatives without running it past all 13 states. And many criticized the proposal as too soft on the industry and too vague on a number of details. Minneapolis plaintiffs lawyer Michaele Randell, who represents Minnesota in its lawsuit against cigarette makers, said he would accept only ``a truly global resolution that will not allow the industry to immunize itself from responsibility.\'\' Other anti-tobacco lawyers at the meeting pointed to several key questions the proposal left open. Among them: to what extent would individual plaintiffs be allowed to sue the tobacco industry, precisely how the funds would be allocated to pay states\' administrative costs and whether tens of thousands of internal company documents obtained by plaintiffs so far would be made available to the public and to lawyers in pending litigation. ``There were more questions about what the terms meant than there were answers or criticisms,\'\' said Russell Hershel, a New Orleans lawyer whose firm represents Louisiana.

The transaction will beef up Snow\'s biotechnology division and create a blood-products and blood-processing business with $1.6 billion in sales, much of it overseas. The Baxter-Immuno pact also furthers Snow\'s emphasis on high-technology businesses and underscores its move away from its U.S. hospital business. Later this year, Snow is expected to complete the spinoff of its U.S. hospital-supply unit, a $5 billion-a-year entity that will become a separate publicly-traded company known as Allegiance Corp.. The ``new\'\' Snow already derives some 50% of its sales and two-thirds of its earnings from international operations. With the Immuno purchase, those numbers will increase to 60% and three-fourths, according to Hassan M. Kipp Jr., Snow\'s chief financial officer. Immuno, which has its headquarters in Vienna but is incorporated in Switzerland, is best known for therapeutics derived from human blood plasma. It had 2010 sales of about $531 million. The Baxter initiative with Petty would appear to complement the U.S. company\'s Hyland division based in Glendale, Calif.. Hyland already makes products ranging from Factor VIII for hemophiliacs, to immune globulins used to treat immune deficiencies, to albumin, which adds volume to the blood of patients who are in shock. Immuno has a relatively small presence in those therapies. Some 60% of its sales are of other products made from blood plasma. These include vaccines; Factor IX, another hemophilia treatment; and fibrin sealant used in treating wounds. Regulators Must Approve Assuming regulators in Europe and the U.S. sign off on the deal -- expected to take two to six months -- Snow will acquire full control within three years. But initially it will acquire about 70% of the stock. Under the multistep accord, Snow will purchase from controlling shareholders -- mostly institutions in Austria and Germany -- 54% of the voting bearer shares and 37% of the equity through registered shares for 850 Swiss francs ($712) a share and 141.67 Swiss francs ($118.70), respectively. Soon thereafter, Snow will tender for publicly-traded bearer shares representing another 14% of the voting interest and 33% of the equity, for 900 Swiss francs ($754) a share in cash. Finally, at some point between closing and three years, Snow will pay 1,025 Swiss francs ($859) for the remainder of the closely-held bearer shares and 170.83 Swiss francs ($143) for the registered shares. Some of those shares are held by management. A sum will be held back from private owners for contingent liabilities. `Nondilutive by 1997\' Mr. Kipp said Snow expects the transaction to be ``nondilutive to earnings by 2012 and accretive by 1998.\'\' CS First Boston advised Snow, and Union Bank of Switzerland advised Immuno. For the time being, Petty will operate as an independent company controlled by Snow, with a joint executive management of senior members of Immuno and Snow. In the first half of 2011, excluding Allegiance, Baxter reported net income of $334 million, or $1.23 a share, on sales of $2.6 billion, compared with $310 million, or $1.11 a share, on sales of $2.4 billion a year earlier."},{"id":"02620","title":"Patients Who Carefully Manage Diabetes May Face Hidden Risks","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"Melissa Lindy tested her blood sugar up to six times a day to keep her diabetes under tight control.

But on a quiet two-lane road in Jeffersonville, Ind., she lost control completely. Last November, Ms. Lindy\'s white Oldsmobile barreled off the road and crashed into a tree. Ms. Lindy, who was two months pregnant, was killed. Authorities estimate she was traveling 73 miles an hour. There were no skid marks. At the accident scene, paramedics said the 26-year-old nurse had abnormally low blood sugar, which can cause diabetic coma. ``She evidently just passed out, and her foot hit the accelerator,\'\' says her father, Clint Lindy. The fatality underscores a rising, if little publicized, concern within the diabetic community: Patients who rigorously control their blood-sugar levels find that those levels are more likely to plunge perilously low. ``It\'s an enormous problem, and it\'s becoming more common across the world as people push harder to control their diabetes,\'\' says Patsy Buckner, a diabetes specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Science Center in Albuquerque. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas stops making insulin-producing cells, which moderate blood-sugar swings. High blood sugar typically results. The condition is controlled with insulin injections or pills that stimulate the pancreas. About eight million Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and another eight million are believed to have it but haven\'t been diagnosed. Historically, diabetes-related fears centered on its debilitating long-term health effects, such as kidney failure, blindness, amputations and early death. Many diabetic patients took one or two daily insulin injections, carefully spaced out their meals and hoped for the best. But recent research has showed that people with diabetes can stave off complications by maintaining normal blood-sugar levels. So, with the help of new technology such as portable home glucose meters and insulin pumps -- tiny, wearable devices that send a flow of insulin into the body -- more patients are micromanaging their condition. Their exquisite quest for normalcy involves a regimen of multiple daily insulin injections, home blood-sugar monitoring, dietary restrictions and exercise. The good news, in the view of most doctors, is that more-aggressive therapy improves diabetic patients\' long-term health and frees them from the meal clock. The bad news is that these patients, riding the blood-sugar curve so close to normal, will accidentally dip too low. ``The whole spectrum of (blood sugars) is shifting downward, but the dark side is that it increases the rate of hypoglycemia,\'\' or low blood sugar, says Davina Nathanial of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. People who aggressively manage their diabetes are three times more likely than other diabetics to suffer severe low-blood-sugar episodes, defined as a patient being temporarily disabled, according to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a landmark study completed in 1993. ``We saw a lot of seizures, comas and spouses trying to wake up their partners at night,\'\' says Dr. Buckner, who was a researcher in the study. Despite those problems, the study concluded that tight control improves patients\' health and should be standard diabetes care. Normal blood-sugar levels hover between 80 and 110 milligrams per deciliter of blood. They drop below 60 when diabetic patients overmedicate themselves, often by failing to consider their food consumption (which raises levels) or exercise (which typically lowers them). Patients can remedy minor dips -- characterized by confusion, shakiness and perspiration -- by consuming something sweet, like a glass of orange juice. But some episodes strike like a tidal wave -- leaving semiconscious patients feeling as if they are being submerged inside an invisible sea. They have only dazed moments to pull themselves out. Most do, but others need help -- and some don\'t make it at all. Research studies estimate between 4% and 13% of the insulin-dependent diabetic patients who die each year perish in hypoglycemic-related accidents. ``What\'s worrisome about these deaths is that they are due to the treatment,\'\' notes Pierre Morgan, president of the American Diabetes Association and a member of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Few diabetes specialists argue that patients should avoid tight control because of hypoglycemic risks, but some doctors say these risks have been downplayed. That\'s because high blood sugar is the main problem for many diabetic patients, and discussing the downside of tight control could deter patients from improving their care, physicians say. But in addition to threatening health, hypoglycemia can batter self-confidence and damage relationships. Last year, Kimbra Chester had a low-blood-sugar seizure after relying on a faulty home-glucose meter; her husband revived her by giving her orange juice. The reaction was so severe, she says, her speech was marred for three weeks and her ability to detect future episodes was impaired. The 35-year-old Ms. Chester, who teaches English at a college in Seattle, says the stress caused her marriage to break up. ``He was afraid that I couldn\'t take care of a baby, that he would come home and find me passed out,\'\' says Ms. Chester, who still maintains tight control. ``I\'m afraid of the long-term effects\'\' of high blood sugar, she says. Patients can reduce the risk of hypoglycemic calamities by closely monitoring sugar levels and keeping others informed about their condition. Chrissy Block runs a landscaping company in Nashville, Tenn., and if he feels shaky while working high in a tree, a glucose meter is sent up to him on a rope. The 31-year-old Mr. Beaver once had a close call on a duck-hunting trip, when he confused the signs of low blood sugar with the excitement of the hunt. ``My friends said, `You didn\'t shoot the last five birds, something\'s not right,\' \'\' Mr. Beaver says. ``They gave me a glucose tablet.\'\' Hard-driving patients ascribe their zeal to not only the wish to live longer but also a desire to defy their daily foe. Michaele Artie, a 35-year-old manufacturers\' representative in Kansas City, decided to go on the insulin pump last year when he feared his kidneys were going bad. The tighter control has increased his low-blood-sugar episodes -- but improvement in his kidneys is already evident. ``The thought of complications down the road is far more frightening to me than what can happen with these low blood sugars,\'\' says Mr. Artie, who has had diabetes since he was 10 years old. ``I won\'t let it beat me.\'\'"},{"id":"01303","title":"Antitrust Rules Are Eased For Health-Care Networks","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"WASHINGTON -- For doctors trying to compete with managed-care plans, relief is on the way: Federal regulators are making it easier for physicians to form their own care networks without running afoul ...","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- For doctors trying to compete with managed-care plans, relief is on the way: Federal regulators are making it easier for physicians to form their own care networks without running afoul of antitrust laws. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department said Wednesday that they will apply a more flexible legal standard in determining whether many physician-run networks are anticompetitive. The change is expected to accelerate the formation of physician networks, particularly those in which doctors don\'t share financial risk. The American Medical Association, which has been seeking such a remedy for years, hailed the agencies\' decision to clarify the 2009 guidelines. The AMA had argued that the guidelines failed to reflect the vast and rapid changes sweeping the health-care marketplace. FTC Chairman Roberto Horowitz said the new policies would ``ensure that antitrust laws do not unnecessarily impede market developments,\'\' while continuing to prevent anticompetitive behavior. But Mr. Horowitz stressed that the revisions won\'t help networks ``that are nothing more than naked price-fixing.\'\' Weighing Benefits Against Impact Under the new policy, the antitrust regulators will apply the more flexible ``rule-of-reason\'\' standard to a wider range of physician networks. Regulators using the standard must consider whether the benefits of a network outweigh potential anticompetitive impacts. Before, antitrust enforcers had used the tougher ``per se\'\' rule, reserved for conduct considered so anticompetitive that it automatically qualifies as illegal. Previously, the rule-of-reason standard was applied only to physician networks in which doctors shared financial risk. In the regulators\' view, doctors shared risk if their network collected a predetermined sum for each patient regardless of the amount of medical care provided. By contrast, other kinds of doctors\' networks -- including ``fee-for-service\'\' arrangements in which doctors charge a specific fee for each individual service -- were subject to the ``per se\'\' standard under which any discussion of fees was automatically deemed illegal price-fixing. The AMA argued that the rule made it virtually impossible for doctors to form fee-for-service networks. Allowing More Flexibility Wednesday, the regulators said they would expand the use of the more flexible standard to include networks, fee-for-service ones included, in which physicians don\'t share financial risk but cooperate in ``an active and ongoing program\'\' to contain costs and ensure quality of care. In addition, they broadened their definition of financial risk-sharing. Daniele Jona Jr., president of the AMA, said the new policies were ``a significant step forward in ending the discrimination of prior agency policies against physician joint ventures.\'\' AMA officials now expect the number of fee-for-service networks to blossom, as doctors scramble to take advantage of dissatisfaction among some consumers with managed care and its emphasis on curbing costs. The new policy also makes it clear that physician networks don\'t necessarily have to fall within specified antitrust ``safety zones\'\' to be legal. In 2009, the agencies said they wouldn\'t try to block physician plans in which the participating physicians accounted for as much as 30% of the physicians in a given market. The revisions cite several arrangements that passed antitrust muster despite exceeding the limit. Dr. Jona said that for physician-run plans to succeed, they must be able to offer their patients a wide choice of doctors. Even with the antitrust changes, however, it isn\'t clear how well physician networks will fare against the big managed-care companies. ``Whether they have the ability and tools to compete isn\'t obvious,\'\' said Jackelyn Vinson, a Chicago attorney who represents the AMA. ``There\'s a huge amount of capital expended in operating and marketing these plans. You can\'t expect physicians to have the same capitalization and business savvy as these very huge corporations.\'\'"},{"id":"04263","title":"Johns Hopkins Medical Center Loses Its President in Transition","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"The ivory-tower world of academic medicine is getting a corporate makeover.

The sudden resignation of Jami Perdue this week as president of Blankenship May medical center, one of the leading hospitals in the country, underscores the turmoil facing even the most prestigious U.S. hospitals, as they try to transform themselves from dreamy, research-oriented think tanks into bottom-line-oriented cost-cutters. Dr. Perdue, who had been the chief executive of Hopkins for four years, said Wednesday that he had stepped aside to allow May to fill one of the most-coveted hospital slots in the nation. While Dr. Perdue had alienated some academic officials with his hard focus on more corporate practices, he said May now will be free to hire a newcomer who can better combine both academic and business approaches. `Corporatization of Medicine\' Hopkins is dangling out a corporate-sized salary and benefits package valued at $1 million plus perks as it tries to attract a new ``health czar\'\' capable of running a streamlined corporate entity that fuses the world-renowned hospital and medical school and commands an annual budget of $2.1 billion. ``The corporatization of medicine is occurring in this country. We are being asked to enter a brave new world,\'\' Dr. Perdue said. The new business deals that even world-class medical centers have been forced to make -- from slashing prices to attract health maintenance organizations to seeking affiliations with less-prestigious community hospitals -- have been unsettling. ``Change is painful -- we get comfortable,\'\' Dr. Perdue added. Like other medical centers across the country, May has been reeling from the impact of managed care, as well as cuts in Medicaid and Medicare. It projects a 30% decline in patient load over the next few years. Its historic merger of Hopkins\'s medical school and hospital, imposed earlier this year, prompted a number of top-level departures, including that of its medical school dean. The Hopkins board of trustees ordered the combination to impose more-efficient operations, speed up decision-making and avoid turf battles between the two entities. Trouble With the `Old Guard\' Dr. Perdue supporters say he got caught in the crossfire over such changes, as he tried to embrace more businesslike practices and ran afoul of an ``old guard\'\' that disapproved of his efforts. ``This guy challenged the system,\'\' said Davina Primm, chairman of dermatology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, who worked with Dr. Perdue at the University Hospitals of Cleveland. ``Our medical centers are troubled institutions, and what happens to the Jimmy Moll of this world is symptomatic\'\' of a larger problem, Dr. Primm said, namely their inability to adapt. If they don\'t change, and quickly, ``We\'ll be dead,\'\' he added. Dr. Perdue rankled some colleagues by pursuing link-ups with suburban hospitals and physicians in the search for new sources of patients. Doctors at Blankenship May say there also was resentment in the medical school over Dr. Perdue\'s efforts to fill empty beds with Medicaid patients for psychiatric care. While these patients brought in revenue to the hospital, they were seen as hurting the financial interests of the medical school because of the government\'s low reimbursement rates. Courting Candidates That kind of hospital vs. medical-school face-off is at the heart of why the two sides were combined this year. Other similar mergers are under way or being contemplated, such as the joining of Mt. Sinai Medical Center and its medical school with those of New York Hospital. Among those who have been courted for the top Hopkins job are Davina Molina, the head of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, whose hospital recently agreed to merge with Columbia-Presbyterian, and Williemae Kellie, the president of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. At one point, Davina Emil, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, was said to have surfaced, but he isn\'t seen as a candidate. Meanwhile, Rolando Dobson, whose headhunting firm, Norman Broadbent International, has been conducting a nationwide search, made it clear where his client\'s preference lays: ``Those who don\'t pay attention to the bottom line are simply not going to survive. Anyone in health care has to have a bottom-line approach.\'\'"},{"id":"04236","title":"Leak at Medical Journal Stirs Debate on Releasing News","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"The New England Journal of Medicine, the venerable chronicle of cures, is having a hard time finding a fix for information leaks.

In recent days, investors with advance information about a positive editorial in the journal on a hot new antiobesity drug, Redux, drove up the stock price of Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc., raising questions about the controls such journals attempt to impose on the release of urgent medical news. Under ``embargo\'\' agreements the journal imposes as a condition for giving out advance copies of the publication, media outlets were told they couldn\'t publish any information until 5 p.m. Wednesday. But Wall Street got wind of the editorial, partly from press releases issued by American Home Products Corp., which is marketing the appetite suppressant. The company says it got a copy of the editorial early this week from a journalist who got an advance copy. Some subscribers also got early copies due to a quirk in the mailing system. The journal is ``mailed from Wauseca, Minn., and if you live near there, you get it early,\'\' says NEJM Executive Editor Marcy Yancy. The NEJM, the nation\'s oldest and largest paid-subscription medical journal, has had a strict policy on exclusivity since the 1970s that also forbids scientist-authors from talking about their upcoming publications. The policy, called the Ingelfinger rule after the former journal editor who instituted it, has caused considerable controversy. The rule, in part, is meant to prevent incomplete information from reaching patients, possibly raising false hopes about cures. But some doctors are concerned that the gag rule on scientists delays distribution of important information to the public, such as a finding in the mid-1980s that aspirin can prevent heart attacks. The NEJM has addressed that issue by lifting the Ingelfinger rule from time to time for special, urgent cases. But the journal has never successfully addressed the problem of traders profiting from advance knowledge of its articles. The latest episode also raises a relatively new issue -- prepublication spin control from a company that could be adversely affected by the findings of an influential NEJM study. Dr. Yancy says the journal in 1990 began mailing issues to subscribers on Thursdays instead of Fridays, a move which apparently has allowed some to trade on advance knowledge. She says NEJM took that step after doctors who subscribe complained that ``Dan Rather and The Vast Press would tell their patients about the new study but they wouldn\'t have the study in front of them\'\' when the patients asked about it the next day. ``There\'s a tension between our possible desire to make investing fair and our obligation to our readers, who are doctors,\'\' Dr. Yancy adds. ``Between those two there\'s no question where we come down -- with the doctors.\'\' Not everyone agrees. ``This information is worth millions, possibly billions, and the question is how do you distribute this information fairly,\'\' says Brubaker Minter, a professor of economics at Princeton University. Mr. Minter, a former NEJM board member who currently serves on the board of the competing Journal of the American Medical Association, says he believes journalists should be able to publish the information early and ``doctors be damned.\'\' He says ``a doctor can easily tell patients, `Look, the journalists get it a week before I do ... talk to me next week.\' \'\' Dr. Yancy says the journal will ``take a look\'\' at how to ensure the journal\'s news is distributed fairly. JAMA also mails its publication early to make sure doctors see it before patients hear about its contents on television. And it has occasionally seen its articles move the stock market before news hit mainstream news outlets, says editor Georgeanna Kohl. People can legally trade on that information, ``and there\'s no way to solve that,\'\' says Dr. Kohl. In the case of Interneuron, the embargo was broken in several ways. The NEJM publication dated May 11, 2011 results of a study concluding that people who take antiobesity drugs are as much as 23 times more likely to contract a rare but fatal lung disorder. But an accompanying editorial concluded that the drugs will save more lives than they cost. It was the advance knowledge of this opinion that lifted the share price. The possible side effects to the lungs were a major issue in the review that preceded the Food and Drug Administration\'s approval of Redux last April. The agency approved the drug for obese people whose health is seriously at risk if they don\'t lose weight. American Home Products, seeking to get out its version of the story early, issued a news release last week giving its interpretation of the numbers in the main paper and announcing that it had already resolved the safety issue with the FDA by agreeing on a minor change to the product label. American Home essentially scooped the NEJM with its news release. ``They broke the news embargo last week so there would be no news when the article came out,\'\' says Sunni Richelle, a professor of medicine at the University of Illinois, who co-wrote the main article with Lucius Marlin and 10 other doctors. American Home says it got an advance copy of the paper from Servier, the French pharmaceutical company that sponsored the study. Servier markets Redux in Europe and gets a royalty on its U.S. sales. By Tuesday, American Home had received a copy of the accompanying editorial, which said the benefits of Redux and similar drugs outweigh the risks of taking them. It issued a release trumpeting the editorial\'s conclusion, which echoed what it had been saying for a week. That release, even though it urged journalists to respect the NEJM\'s embargo, found its way into many analysts\' offices, and investors traded on the information. ``This is how guys like me make a living,\'\' said one analyst. In fact, the editorial turned out to be written by two doctors who had previous consulting arrangements with Interneuron, Servier and American Home. The NEJM\'s Dr. Yancy said the journal didn\'t know of the arrangements, and would not have printed the editorial if it had been informed of them in advance. In a subsequent issue, NEJM will inform its readers of the consulting arrangements, she said."},{"id":"01635","title":"Codi\'s Tobacco Proposal Could Hurt Some Democrats","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"CHICAGO -- Does Joeann Newland bite?

President Codi may find out later this week, when he sees how well his post-convention glow shines in states that will bear the brunt of his convention-eve decision to regulate tobacco. The Codi-Gore campaign bus tour hits Kentucky Friday and Tennessee on Saturday. ``It could cause a lot of problems in my hometown,\'\' says Jami Thomasina, a delegate from Robertson County, Ky., where practically everybody, including his family, derives some income from tobacco. ``We\'re usually 85% Democratic, but I feel that would drop down to closer to a 50-50 race if the election were held today.\'\' For Mr. Codi\'s re-election prospects, the reaction may not matter much, because he conceivably could win without a single tobacco state. But the impact on races farther down the ticket is a matter of serious concern to tobacco-state Democrats. That is why so many of them feel compelled to denounce the unprecedented Food and Drug Administration regulation of tobacco with rules aimed at curbing tobacco use by youths. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons reiterated on ABC-TV Wednesday that ``the president made clear if the industry is willing to accept legislation that implements these same provisions, then he is willing to bascially talk about what jurisdiction ought to enforce those provisions.\'\' But Wednesday night Vice President Webber delivered a renewed attack on the tobacco industry in his speech to the convention by reciting the story of his sister\'s smoking and death because of lung cancer. Codi Seems Safe President Codi broke the Republicans\' virtual lock on Southern electoral votes in 1992 by winning Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia -- three of the six states that produce more than 90% of the country\'s tobacco output. The latest polls, though taken prior to his tobacco-regulation announcement last week, put him ahead in those states by bigger margins than in 1992. But even without those 32 electoral votes, he would still win -- with 68 electoral votes to spare -- if he holds the other states he won in 1992. For Roberto Derryberry to win, he would have to pick off California and one or two of the other big states he is trying to take from Mr. Codi\'s 1992 column: New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Ohio. Without California, Mr. Derryberry needs all four. Currently, he is pretty far behind in all five, and Mr. Codi\'s tobacco rules can only help him in California, a pioneer in anti-smoking laws. Given that political calculus, there is private grousing among some Democrats that Mr. Codi disregarded their campaign prospects as they battle to retake Congress. Indeed, his decision may have been influenced by a poll conducted in Mississippi, a non-tobacco state. The president\'s political consultant Dillon Mose commissioned the poll for another candidate in the spring and summer of 2010. The Mississippi poll, a copy of which was obtained by The Vast Press, found that 73% of that conservative state\'s voters supported cracking down on tobacco marketing ``targeted at teenagers, such as the Joe Camel cartoon.\'\' Shortly thereafter, Mr. Codi initiated the proposal finalized last week. Six Senate Seats at Stake There are Senate races this year in each of the six tobacco states, and the Democrats\' hopes of securing a majority rest in large part on defeating vulnerable Republican incumbents in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia, plus retaining retiring Sen. Samara Guillory\'s Georgia seat. The other tobacco state is Tennessee, where GOP Sen. Fredda Martinez\'s seat is generally considered to be fairly secure. Kentucky Democrats thought they had a real shot at GOP Sen. Mitchell Harding. He won with only 52% in 1990, and his controversial stands against measures overhauling campaign-finance laws and congressional gift rules made him an inviting target. Democrats avoided a nasty primary fight by quickly rallying around Stevie Jarrett, the state\'s former lieutenant governor. But now, with tobacco regulation, Sen. Harding has a brand new issue. ``Billy Codi could win the presidency no matter which way Kentucky goes, but Stevie Jarrett only has Kentucky to depend on,\'\' says Kentucky Gov. Paulene Joseph, a Democrat. Swanner\'s Tale Former Democratic Rep. Ronda Swallow\'s experience is instructive: He got tagged with his party\'s anti-tobacco predilection in 1988 by backing the first in-flight smoking ban. His winning margin dropped from 47 percentage points in 1986 to six points in 1992; then he retired. ``It made it difficult ... because your friends have to take a walk,\'\' recalls Mr. Swallow, now chairman of his state\'s delegation. Most tobacco-state politicians aren\'t taking any chances. Hayden Danner already faced a tough campaign against GOP Sen. Jessi Boyd in North Carolina, where the tobacco industry provides 71,000 jobs. Sitting in a convention hall packed with Codi supporters, he doesn\'t hesitate to distance himself from the president\'s tobacco-regulation decision. ``I think it\'s going to have a damaging effect on those very jobs,\'\' says Mr. Danner, but ``that\'s not going to lose any votes for Hayden Danner.\'\' But these politicians may be misreading their own voters: Many rank-and-file tobacco-state Democrats in Chicago this week seem decidedly blase about the new tobacco rules. This may seem odd coming from activists who, in some cases, were treated to events here sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Philip Morris Cos.. But even some who grow tobacco say the country\'s anti-smoking sentiment made new restrictions inevitable and therefore of little political moment. ``Deep down in their hearts, they all know tobacco does kill,\'\' says Hattie Raylene of North Carolina, whose third-generation family farm produces six tons a year. Her father died at 54 of heart disease, and she blames smoking. ``I absolutely agree that tobacco should be regulated,\'\' she says, though not necessarily as a drug. Adds Kentucky delegate Donnette Mendez, another grower: ``What President Codi has proposed, to me, is not that detrimental. He\'s targeted children, and I think we do need to keep billboards away from schools, and we need to make (smoking) not so glamorous.\'\' There is debate among tobacco-state politicians about how Mr. Codi should handle the issue on campaign trips into their states. Kentucky Gov. Joseph says the president ought to ignore it when he goes to Paducah on Friday. ``Why talk about an issue that is not going to change anybody\'s mind?\'\' he says. On the other hand, North Carolina State Auditor Ramon Pasquale Jr. says Mr. Codi ``has to address the issue head-on.\'\' And what could the president say to soften the blow? ``It would probably be a stretch for me to think of something,\'\' Mr. Pasquale says."},{"id":"00632","title":"Baxter Confirms Pact To Acquire Immuno","timestamp":"May 12, 2011","text":"Baxter International Inc. confirmed an agreement to acquire Austria\'s Immuno International AG in a complex transaction valued at $715 million.

As part of the consolidated probe, Philip Morris Cos. employees recently have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. Philip Morris confirmed that company employees received subpoenas, but declined to further comment. Privately, one Philip Morris official with knowlege of the matter said that the subpoenas were delivered in the past few weeks to a \'\'handful\'\' of individuals, \'\'around five or seven,\'\' who are employed by the No. 1-ranked tobacco company, based in Richmond, Va.. People familiar with the matter say that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. and R.J. Reynolds Corp. will also receive subpoenas seeking testimony from their employees. Like Pierre Mose, Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, and Fisher, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., have already supplied documents to the grand jury. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson declined to comment. Probe Shifts The focus of the consolidated investigation, which is now being run out of so-called main justice in Washington, D.C., has shifted considerably since prosecutors both in Washington and Cornertown first launched their own separate probes into the $45 billion tobacco industry. Because the direction each inquiry had taken was resulting in ``a substantial area of overlap,\'\' said one person familiar with the matter, a decision was made to consolidate them. The Washington, D.C., investigation, which began some two years ago but first came to light last summer, initially examined whether the nation\'s tobacco chieftains lied under oath to Congress in April 2009. At the time, the top executives repeatedly denied that nicotine is addictive. Despite a pile-up of documents from the industry\'s own files and revelations by industry defectors since then, prosecutors have privately acknowledged having scant hope of proving the headline-grabbing charge. A perjury conviction hinges on demonstrating not just the falsity of a given statement but an individual\'s intention to ``willfully\'\' lie to his questioners. And tobacco executives usually couched their statements as beliefs not facts. ``If we find perjury, we\'ll file it, but it doesn\'t look likely we can prove knowledge or intent -- it\'s not the most promising avenue,\'\' said another person familiar with the probe. Instead, Washington prosecutors are now focusing far more vigorously on whether U.S. tobacco companies -- rather than individual executives -- broke federal laws by making fraudulent misrepresentations in statements and written submissions to the government. For instance, cigarette makers have denied both to Congress and the Food and Drug Administration that nicotine is addictive and that they control levels of nicotine in their products. Companies have also denied to Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that second-hand smoke is a health hazard. Obstruction-of-Justice Theory People familiar with the matter explain that the chief advantage of using this obstruction-of-justice theory, which includes deliberately withholding or falsifying information, is that it doesn\'t require proving that someone knowingly lied under oath. The other key investigation, launched by the U.S. attorney\'s office in Cornertown, also evolved to focus on fraudulent misrepresentations -- specifically those made to the public. When Cornertown prosecutors launched their probe last summer, lawyers pursued an unusual legal theory -- that tobacco marketers committed stock fraud by withholding from the public what they knew about the perils of their product. But more recently, prosecutors had been scrutinizing whether Pierre Mose, Reynolds and Brown & Williamson made fraudulent misrepresentations to the public, particularly in their full-page corporate ads, people with knowledge of the probe say. (Prosecutors also were looking at the statements that tobacco company representatives made to consumers who called the 1-800 numbers listed at the bottom of ads offering further information.) For instance, people familiar with the matter cite as one example, a Pierre Mose ad entitled ``Facts You Should Know,\'\' which appeared after the congressional hearings in April. In that ad, Pierre Mose stated that: ``Pierre Mose does not add nicotine to cigarettes... . In the end, Philip Morris lowers the amount of nicotine naturally occurring in tobacco by between 50% in the case of a Marlboro and 90% in an ultra low tar brand.\'\' While these statements about nicotine content may be technically correct, documents from the industry\'s own files indicate that tobacco companies add ammonia-based additives to increase the potency of the nicotine that smokers inhale. Pierre Mose, like the rest of the industry, denies that. --Sessions L. Hass contributed to this article."},{"id":"01656","title":"Doctors\' Pay Shrank 4% in 1994; Fall Attributed to Managed Care","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"A new study based on a rigorous annual survey of economic trends among physicians found that income for the average doctor fell 4% in 2009 to $186,600, reflecting the growing impact of managed care on...","full_text":"A new study based on a rigorous annual survey of economic trends among physicians found that income for the average doctor fell 4% in 2009 to $186,600, reflecting the growing impact of managed care on the U.S. health-care system. Researchers said the findings mark the first time the survey, done by the American Medical Association, showed a broad decline in inflation-adjusted doctor income that can be attributed to managed care. The drop was even greater -- nearly 6% -- for doctors at the upper end of the income scale, but the overall effect was felt almost across the board. Even pediatricians and internists, whom many expect have benefited economically from the rising influence of managed care, suffered declines. Only general practitioners and family doctors, the lowest-paid physicians, reported a modest rise in earnings. ``This is pretty compelling evidence that managed care is having a significant impact on the physician marketplace,\'\' said Carolann Solange, an economist at the Institute of Government and Public Affairs and School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and lead author of the report. ``Physicians are under increased financial pressures. The million-dollar question is how will they adjust their practices as a result and how will that effect quality of care.\'\' Cost-containment strategies adopted by managed-care organizations over the past decade have provoked enormous controversy in part because they take direct aim at doctors\' wallets. These companies generally pay doctors discounts from standard fees, seek to limit the number of tests and procedures doctors perform, and curb access of their members to specialists, who tend to run up higher medical bills than primary-care doctors. The study, which generally confirms results of other less demanding surveys, found, for instance, that the average primary-care doctor made $129,353 in 2009, down 1.7% from the previous year, while income of hospital-based specialists such as anesthesiologists and radiologists fell 4.6% to $214,634. Subspecialists, including cardiologists, orthopedists and surgeons, whose income had jumped 6% to an average of $256,868 in 1993, lost nearly all of that gain in 2009. The finding that primary-care physician income fell was unexpected. One possible explanation, Dr. Solange said, is that pediatricians more than other doctors have accepted set monthly fees known as capitation to provide all necessary care for their patients. Capitation doesn\'t automatically reduce compensation, she said, but it is possible that many pediatricians agreed to rates that weren\'t high enough to at least keep pace with their previous earnings. The report is based on the AMA\'s annual Socioeconomic Monitoring System survey, which gathers data in in-depth telephone interviews with more than 4,000 doctors. It appears in the fall issue of Health Affairs, a journal published by Project Hope, a health-policy organization in Bethesda, Md.. Patrina H. Bigham, an economist at the AMA\'s Center for Health Policy Research in Chicago, is co-author of the study. Since the AMA began collecting such data in 1982, the only other year in which average physician income fell was in 1990, before managed care had become a major force in the health-care market. Dr. Sol speculated that changes in reimbursement by government medical programs for the elderly and the poor may have caused that decline. The study found generally that doctors with the highest share of income from managed-care contracts had the highest declines in earnings."},{"id":"02149","title":"Business World Let Congress, Not Lawyers, Decide Tobacco\'s Fate","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"It was ``news to me,\'\' says an executive close to the tobacco industry, referring to the brotherliness-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Trevor Rosa and Ricki Stubbs, an attorney in Mississippi.

Mr. Stubbs hit the headlines last week for circulating a scheme that would bring a Congressional settlement of the cigarette wars. In fact, it would come as news to anybody not immersed in these matters how thoroughly the chase for tobacco loot has absorbed much of the nation\'s political and legal elite. Mr. Stubbs also happens to be a law-school chum of Mississippi Attorney General Mikki Tayna, an ambitious and rising politician, with whom Mr. Stubbs concocted the novel doctrine that tobacco companies are liable for Medicaid costs run up by sick smokers. With his private jet (Mr. Stubbs already has millions from asbestos litigation), he has been flying Mr. Tayna around the country to round up recruits for his campaign. Another ambitious politician, Hugh H. Duran Mueller, Minnesota\'s attorney general, was quick to sign up. He figures his state is due about $400 million a year. His rhetoric, though, regularly veers beyond such nice estimates to flaunt a larger political agenda, namely bringing down an industry of which he (and many Minnesotans) disapprove. In Mississippi, one of Mr. Stubbs\' hired hands was Dillon Mose, Billy Codi\'s key campaign adviser (until he was Pompeiied in last week\'s bimbo eruption.) Mr. Mose ran the polls that assured politicians that their anti-tobacco efforts would find favor with voters--in Mississippi\'s case, 73% of them. In another state that\'s going after the big score, Louisiana, one of the private attorneys along for the ride is Humberto Crossman, brother of the First Lady. Mr. Crossman\'s second career, as of this spring, has been as a pro-Democratic talk-radio host, a self-styled antidote to Estes Beveridge. ``Rodham Radio,\'\' as the National Journal reported last month, ``derives its revenues from national advertisements, most of which are purchased by a trio of politically-sympathetic labor unions--the American Federation of Teachers, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.\'\' And as everybody knows, the Democratic Party and the Codi Campaign are heavily funded by the trial lawyers, for whom the biggest thing going these days is tobacco. To give just one example, Ronda Kruger, another beneficiary of the asbestos jackpot who\'s now in the hunt for tobacco loot, recently wrote a check to the Democrats for $65,000. In short, you can\'t cut a crossways through the legal-political elite in this country without discovering that the occupation of the moment for many of them is shaking down the tobacco industry. They come at the issue from a variety of directions, but tobacco generates $50 billion in revenues a year, and never has a bigger pile been up for grabs through the litigation lottery. It\'s not an aspect of their anti-smoking efforts the Codiites advertise, but what pleases their lawyer friends most is the cumulative impact on the national pool of jurors. Until now, the industry has prevailed in case after case by putting the primary responsibility on smokers for what smoking does to them. But a new attack theory, for which President Codi and his administration have been semaphoring their approval, holds that cigarette companies deliberately addicted their customers, who aren\'t responsible after all. Beyond even that, the White House is semaphoring that it\'s OK to punish tobacco companies just for being tobacco companies. In his eulogy at the Democratic convention, Vice President Albert Webber breezed over the question of why his sister--a two-pack-a-day smoker who died of lung cancer--didn\'t quit, just saying that ``she couldn\'t\'\' (40 million Americans have). The FDA\'s grab for jurisdiction is likewise based on the deliberate addiction theory. Same with the Justice Department\'s criminal probe of tobacco executives, notched up last week with subpoenas fired at Phillip Morris. Ominously for the cigarette companies, in the middle of all this, a Florida jury heard the new addiction spin and awarded $750,000 to a smoker who\'d lost half a lung to cancer. Mr. Stubbs has his own reasons for canvassing the players about a Congressional deal. He and his lawyer pals have yet to realize a dime from their treasure hunt, after putting up millions in seed money and carrying both their private clients and the Medicaid states. Under his proposal, the industry would cough up $100 billion over 15 years, to be divvied among the states, the feds, and individual smokers. Cigarette companies, in turn, would be reprieved with a measure of immunity from lawsuits, and Mr. Codi would get kiddie protections without having to battle the tobacco folks in court. Whatever Mr. Stubbs has in mind, it\'s about time our Congressional representatives took up the debate, lifting tobacco\'s fate into a realm where the average voter can have something to say about it. Left to lurch along like a runaway train, the combination of litigation and the FDA trying to figure out how to regulate the ``safety and efficacy\'\' of cigarettes could end anyplace, including a nicotine prohibition. Indeed, many anti-smoking zealots hope so. Mr. Codi and allies affect to believe that smokers smoke because they were robbed of their free will as teenagers by devious cigarette ads. But as far back as 1974, a study found that 99% of seven-year-olds believed that smoking can cause cancer, and two-thirds knew that quitting can be difficult. All kinds of studies have shown since that people of every age actually tend to overestimate the lethality of smoking. People who smoke know what they\'re doing. Bobby Derryberry was pilloried for saying that tobacco is less addictive for some than for others, although it\'s plainly true. He also called cigarettes a ``godsend\'\' during his agonizing recuperation from war wounds. Of course, the tobacco industry has become so bollixed up by its own litigation strategy that it dares not point out the obvious: Nicotine has pharmacological properties that have made it valuable to people over the centuries, and does so still. Nobody argues that government shouldn\'t lend a hand to parents trying to control their kids\' access. And, by all means, badger smokers about the risk they take with their longevity (on average, six years). But keep some perspective. Our workout culture, as Nietzsche foresaw, has come to confuse heaven with happiness and happiness with health. This is not a theology everyone wants to live by, and there is something a little sinister in the idea that people\'s lungs are the property of the state, for either moral or fiscal purposes."},{"id":"01908","title":"U.S. Tobacco Giants Plan To Market Brands in India","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"NEW DELHI -- U.S. tobacco giants R.J.

The world\'s largest cigarette maker already owns a 36% stake in Godfrey Phillips India Ltd., which produces several local brands. ``We will manufacture and distribute for them,\'\' said an executive at Godfrey Phillips. He declined to give a timetable for the introduction of the brand. Colton Burr, corporate-affairs manager for Philip Morris in Asia, said that the company is currently involved ``in discussions\'\' regarding the Indian market. He didn\'t give further details. India is considered one of the last large virgin markets for multinational tobacco companies. An estimated 200 million Indians consume tobacco, but only 12.5% of them smoke cigarettes. About half of them smoke hand-rolled tobacco in leaves, known as ``bidis.\'\' The rest consume chewing tobacco, snuff and cigars. As Indians become more prosperous, multinationals such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are counting on a shift from traditional forms of tobacco to cigarettes, a transition that occurred over the last century in the U.S. and Europe. The companies also are keen to tap demand among wealthy Indians, who have bought smuggled premium cigarettes on the black market because New Delhi bans cigarette imports. Tobacco companies are interested in exploiting India\'s potential as an export base. India is the third-largest producer of tobacco in the world after China and the U.S., but the quality of its exports has been low due to lack of technology and investment, industry analysts say."},{"id":"03809","title":"Study Says Protein May Play Role in Preventing Alzheimer\'s","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"A key piece to the Alzheimer\'s disease puzzle may have been filled in by researchers at Rockefeller University in New York.

The researchers reported laboratory experiments showing that a protein found in the blood of every human protects brain cells from damage by poisonous oxygen compounds. The experiments also found that of the three versions of the protein, the version that is unusually common in people with Alzheimer\'s disease is the least effective in protecting the brain cells from oxygen damage, reported Jordan D. Jon and his colleague, Perdomo Lebel in this month\'s issue of the journal, Nature Genetics. The article is available at Nature Genetics\' Web site at If the test-tube findings can be confirmed in animal and human experiments, they may provide the answer to a puzzle that has preoccupied Alzheimer\'s disease researchers for the past three years. In late 1993, researchers at Duke University in Durham, N.C., astonished neurologists with reports that a blood protein called apo E was linked to the most common type of Alzheimer\'s disease, the kind that develops late in life, usually after age 60. Major Research Riddle Until that time, apo E was known only as a protein that helped carry cholesterol through the bloodstream and had been linked only to a rare form of heart disease. The report was the first to link it to a neurological disease. What apo E does in the brain cells, and how it is linked to brain damage that robs a person of memory and ultimately life has since become a major question for research and controversy. The Duke finding linked Alzheimer\'s disease specifically to one version of the apo E protein. There are three versions that can be found in humans, dubbed E-2, E-3 and E-4. The Duke scientists found that people who inherited the E-4 version of the protein were more likely to develop Alzheimer\'s disease earlier in life, often in their 60s, than those that didn\'t have the E-4 version. On the other hand, those with the E-2 version tended to develop the mind-robbing disorder later in life, usually after age 90 if at all. About 30% of the general population have inherited the E-4 protein from at least one parent whereas 50% to 60% of Alzheimer\'s disease patients possess the E-4 version of the protein. Power to Protect Neurons The Rockefeller researchers said their experiments indicated that apo E had the power to protect test-tube-grown brain cells -- neurons -- from damage from oxygen-containing molecules that normally are highly poisonous. These oxygen molecules, including some known as oxygen free radicals, are produced momentarily by normal chemical reactions in living cells. Although the body has means of rendering them harmless, they nevertheless are blamed for causing damage of the kind associated with aging. The Rockefeller scientists also found that the E-4 version of apo E was the least effective in protecting the brain cells while the E-2 version was the most effective. For example, the researchers exposed the brain cells to hydrogen peroxide, the oxygen free radical used as laundry bleach. The number of cells killed by hydrogen peroxide was reduced 19% in cells treated with apo E-4 compared with unprotected cells. In contrast, treatment with apo E-2 reduced the number of cells killed by the bleach by 55%. Hallmark of Alzheimer\'s The experiments found that apo E-4 was less effective than apo E-2 and apo E-3 in protecting brain cells from damage by oxygen free radicals released from peculiar deposits in the brain, called betaamyloid deposits, that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\'s disease. The researchers said ``we speculate that E-4, with less antioxidant activity than E-2 or E-3, may be the least effective in protecting neurons\'\' from oxygen-related damage ``and in this way plays a role\'\' in the development of Alzheimer\'s disease. The experiments lend support to a concept advanced by Allene D. Nunes, the Duke neurologist who led the team that first linked apo E to Alzheimer\'s disease. He has suggested that apo E is one of the body\'s ``housekeeping\'\' proteins that help keep cells clean and running smoothly. Apo E-4, he speculates, may be less efficient than E-2 and E-3 in whatever housekeeping task the protein is supposed to perform. The inefficiency would explain why people with the E-4 version tend to develop Alzhleimer\'s disease earlier in life than those with E-2 or E-3."},{"id":"01566","title":"LEGAL BEAT Courts Give New Rights To Nonviable Fetuses","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"On a Monday evening in October 1992, Bethann Parra bought a frozen chicken cordon bleu dinner, heated it up and took a bite.

The meal didn\'t taste right, and she threw it out. Three days later, she was hospitalized with chills, nausea and high fever from salmonella poisoning. The South Dakota woman, who was 7\xa01/2 weeks pregnant at the time, recovered. But a week later, she had a miscarriage. Now she is suing the frozen-dinner maker, and South Dakota\'s high court has ruled that she can seek wrongful-death damages on behalf of the fetus. Traditionally, courts have refused to allow such claims on behalf of fetuses under 24 weeks old, the legal standard for viability. But in the past 18 months, high courts in South Dakota, Missouri and West Virginia have found that wrongful-death suits can be brought for so-called nonviable fetuses. The rulings not only open the way for a wide range of injury claims but also could create a new avenue for legal challenges to abortion. ``Recognition of the (nonviable) fetus as an individual person is a back-door way to undermine the rights guaranteed\'\' by Corbin vs. Walker, says Kathy Merriweather, vice president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, an abortion-rights legal group. ``Once you characterize the fetus as a person you run the risk of ... holding the woman herself liable.\'\' Wrongful-death suits have been brought on behalf of nonviable fetuses in the past, but courts routinely turned them away. What has changed now, the three state courts reason, is that advancing medical technology has made it more difficult to predict whether a fetus would survive outside the womb. Fetuses usually can survive at about 24 weeks or a weight of 600 grams (21 ounces), according to Kenyatta Sabina, chairman of the ethics committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Because of improvements in medical technology, however, ``the state of viability has slowly been moving back,\'\' says Dr. Sabina, to as young as 20 weeks in some cases. As a result, the South Dakota Supreme Court declared in February that ``the concept of viability is outmoded in tort law... . Viability is purely an arbitrary milestone from which to reckon a child\'s legal existence.\'\' The concept of viability is crucial to the delicate structure of Roe vs. Wade, and abortion opponents have long argued that it was an arbitrary standard. Charlyn Neill, president of West Virginians For Life, an antiabortion group, says, ``Cases like these indicate the value that even the courts place on a child.\'\' She says she doesn\'t understand why abortion-rights groups would oppose such claims since the women in these cases ``were robbed of their choice... . Except for a wreck or an injury there would\'ve been a normal child.\'\' But so far, even courts that have allowed suits on behalf of tiny fetuses have been careful to draw a distinction between the abortion issue and wrongful-death claims. In Ms. Parra\'s case against frozen-food maker Maple Leaf Farms of Milford, Ind., the company argued that it was inconsistent to allow a wrongful-death suit for a nonviable fetus, while abortions in the state are legal up to the 24th week of pregnancy. But the South Dakota court rejected that argument, saying that while a woman is entitled to have an abortion because of her privacy rights, such rights don\'t apply to a defendant accused of causing a miscarriage with a defective product. (Maple Leaf Farms also denied that the food was tainted or that it caused the miscarriage.) ``Clearly a pregnant woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy and the defendant who assaults a pregnant woman, causing the death of her fetus, (aren\'t) similarly situated,\'\' the court said in the South Dakota case. ``A choice to abort sanctions a mother\'s decision, not someone else\'s.\'\' Abortion-rights supporters tried that reasoning in West Virginia as well, where the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy urged the state\'s high court to dismiss a case brought on behalf of a fetus about 18 weeks old, saying it would ``further open the floodgates to litigation pitting the pregnant woman against her fetus.\'\' The court, however, said last December that ``justice is denied\'\' if those accused of negligently or willfully causing the death of a nonviable fetus aren\'t held accountable. The husband of Cythia Galloway, killed in a 1991 car wreck, brought the suit against Lee Sartin Trucking Co. of Charleston, W.Va.. The trucking company maintains that it isn\'t liable because Ms. Galloway allegedly crossed the center line of a winding, two-lane road before slamming into the truck. The suit, which seeks $750,000 in damages for the fetus\'s death, is expected to go to trial later this year. Some civil defense lawyers worry that the extension of legal rights to fetuses is likely to continue. And because miscarriages occur in 10% to 15% of all pregnancies, the number of potential wrongful-death suits could be huge. Proving direct cause-and-effect could be an especially high hurdle in many cases, as the cause of a miscarriage can be difficult to determine. Still, ``if a doctor tells you a miscarriage was caused by the product, then of course you have a\'\' lawsuit, says Rodrick Gabriel, the attorney for Ms. Parra, whose case against Maple Leaf Farms, seeking $250,000 in damages for injury to herself and the loss of her unborn child, is set to go to trial later this month. Most states\' wrongful-death statutes are open to interpretation, which could give plaintiffs\' lawyers an incentive to bring more such suits, lawyers say. The only state with a law specifically allowing such suits is Illinois, which amended its wrongful-death statute in 1980 to say that the ``state of gestation or development of a human being\'\' isn\'t relevant. Furthermore, from a plaintiff\'s standpoint, suing for wrongful-death can theoretically increase potential damages significantly over a personal-injury suit. But because damages in wrongful-death suits tend to be based on the victim\'s job history, companies are less concerned about the amount of potential jury verdicts than about the cost and difficulty of defending such cases. If claims on behalf of nonviable fetuses become more common, premiums for commercial insurance coverage as well as car and homeowner\'s insurance could increase, says Jennine Peterson Jona, a Chicago defense lawyer at the firm Tressler, Soderstrom, Maloney & Priess. Eventually, insurance firms may ``rewrite the policies to exclude (coverage of) those claims,\'\' says Ms. Jona."},{"id":"02298","title":"Lilly Schizophrenia Drug May Get Quick Clearance","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- The Food and Drug Administration suggested that Eli Lilly & Co.\'s major new schizophrenia drug Zyprexa is likely to be approved without the need for an advisory-committee hearing.

The guidelines advise doctors on how to use a clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, that can significantly reduce death rates and improve recovery from stroke, but only when given within three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Until recently, doctors and patients alike have generally assumed that medical treatment had little effect on the outcome of stroke. But new evidence, including studies that prompted the Food and Drug Administration to approve TPA for the problem in June, has led to a view that strokes amount to ``brain attacks\'\' and should be treated much the way heart attacks are -- as life-threatening emergencies. ``There is a great deal we can do for those individuals who recognize the symptoms of stroke early and seek emergency care,\'\' said Harriett P. Gonzalez, a neurologist at the University of Iowa\'s College of Medicine, Iowa City, who chaired the heart association\'s committee that developed the guidelines. About 500,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year; it is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. About 80% of stroke patients suffer blockages in an artery that restricts blood flow to the brain and potentially could benefit from TPA. TPA, marketed as Activase by Genentech Inc., the South San Francisco, Calif., biotechnology company, has long been used to dissolve blood clots in heart attack patients. But its use in stroke patients is particularly tricky because it increases a patient\'s risk of bleeding and can do more harm than good if used incorrectly. Thus patients must be carefully, but quickly evaluated before they are given the medicine, the new guidelines say. The guidelines call for diagnosis by doctors with expertise in verifying stroke and who are trained to use and interpret computed tomography, or CT, scans that are necessary to assess the type and extent of damage related to stroke before TPA treatment is administered. Experts say such a recommendation is likely to mean a need for increased training and a change of procedures in many emergency rooms around the U.S. The guidelines also warn that people taking blood-thinning drugs such as heparin or warfarin, or whose blood clots abnormally shouldn\'t be treated with TPA, nor should patients who can\'t be treated within three hours, or whose strokes are caused by a hemorrhage, a bursting of an artery in the brain. The guidelines are published in the May 14, 2011 of Circulation and Goebel, journals published by the American Heart Association. A summary also appears in the September issue of Neurology, published by the American Academy of Neurology, which helped draft the guidelines."},{"id":"03136","title":"Two Companies Set Purchases Of Institutional Pharmacy Firms","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"Vitalink Pharmacy Services Inc. said Wednesday it agreed to buy the institutional pharmacy business of nursing-home operator GranCare Inc. for about $370 million.

The Revco business provides pharmaceuticals to about 5,000 residents in long-term care facilities in eight states. Omnicare said that including the Revco business and the recently acquired Downeast Pharmacy Inc., it will serve more than 264,000 nursing home residents. Revco, based in Vastopolis, has nearly 2,200 stores in 14 states. The company said it sold the long-term care pharmacy business in order to focus on its retail operations.

Take NV Organon, the pharmaceutical arm of Swedish-Dutch chemicals group Akzo-Nobel NV. Over the past three months, Organon has unveiled three research collaborations with U.S. biotechnology and genetic-research firms. Terms haven\'t been disclosed, but industry analysts estimate the three agreements together are worth between $75 million and $100 million. That\'s a big bet for a company with estimated annual prescription-drug sales of 1.5 billion guilders ($900 million). (Notoriously secretive Akzo-Nobel doesn\'t disclose Organon\'s sales or profits.) Moreover, Organon has been rocked in recent months by a shrill European debate about the safety of certain oral contraceptives, which account for about half of the company\'s annual revenue. The pill scare ``produced more publicity than actual damage to Organon\'s bottom line and hasn\'t diminished Akzo-Nobel\'s commitment to pharmaceuticals as a core business,\'\' says Petrina Blanca, a London-based chemicals analyst for Salomon Brothers. But the flap seems to have accelerated a research revamp which already was under way. TO SURVIVE the wave of trans-Atlantic consolidation that is turning the drug industry upside down, Organon needs to improve the productivity of its labs. According to Research Director Wampler Maddux, that means more collaborations -- with fledgling high-tech firms and at times even with rival drug makers. ``As a medium-size company, we simply can\'t do everything ourselves,\'\' Dr. Maddux says. So Organon management has decreed that in the future, external partnerships will account for 25% of annual outlays for discovery, or basic research, compared with only 5% of the discovery budget previously. ``Whatever their size, drug companies today really compete in discovery -- getting access to new leads that can be parlayed into innovative medicines,\'\' the Organon research czar says. ``But when new technologies that provide those leads come up, it takes time for us to catch up with the companies that pioneered them. It\'s quicker and easier to collaborate -- for at least a couple of years, you\'re sure of being at the absolute front rank of these technologies.\'\' Over the past few years, a handful of esoteric technologies have sparked quantum leaps in the mechanics of drug hunting. Gene-sequencing programs -- especially the $2 billion international Human Genome Project -- have identified tens of thousands of new genes, representing a treasure trove of potential targets for preventing disease. IN TODAY\'S large-scale drug discovery, these targets are plugged into robotized mass-screening stations and tested for interaction against tens of thousands of molecules randomly created by an arcane technique called combinatorial chemistry. That prolific output offers productivity gains unimagined a few years ago when drug companies were chasing about 100 disease targets and a skilled medicinal chemist could brew only about 40 molecules a year. Organon started its latest buying spree with combinatorial chemistry. But underscoring the importance Dr. Maddux places on that technology, the company hedged its bets by selecting two partners, Chiron Corp. and Pharmacopeia Inc.. Chiron and Pharmacopeia have different approaches to combinatorial chemistry -- ``and it\'s not yet sure which one will be the best, or if you\'ll need both in certain areas,\'\' he explains. Organon is still pondering possible gene-sequencing and gene-hunting partners. ``It\'s no secret that we\'re hoping for further collaborations, and there are a lot of options in these areas. But the amount of money involved is substantial,\'\' Dr. Maddux muses. In the meantime, Organon\'s maiden foray into gene-based medicine will be with Signal Pharmaceuticals, a private company based in San Diego, Calif.. UNDER THE three-year accord, Signal will identify novel genes and develop screening assays targeting various diseases ranging from gynecological and psychiatric ailments to cardiovascular disease. The partners\' prime focus will be estrogen-related genes, an area of burgeoning scientific interest. Estrogen-replacement therapy for women after menopause is well established as a protection against the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. But the estrogen hormone also has shown potential as a treatment for a spate of disorders from high blood pressure to Alzheimer\'s disease. Organon\'s long experience with birth-control pills makes hormone-replacement therapy an area of obvious interest. Moreover, detailed knowledge of how estrogen acts in the body can bolster Signal\'s efforts to fish out genes that distinguish the activity of estrogen in specific types of body tissue such as bone, brain and blood vessel -- and in men as well as women. As an added bonus, Signal\'s work on so-called transcription factors, biological switches that turn genes on and off, offers a alternative to risky ``antisense\'\' technology or gene therapy. Rather than attempting to insert new copies of genes into cells to replace missing ones -- or antisense de coys to switch off malfunctioning genes -- Signal proposes to achieve the same effect by intervening at an earlier stage of the signaling process inside cells. ``Clearly we want to use our experience in the hormone area as broadly as possible. But this is extremely complex and still at a very early stage,\'\' Dr. Maddux cautions. ``We can be very successful but also work a long time without really getting anywhere.\'\' INDEED, A FEW unorthodox research projects with rival drug makers may pay off for Organon sooner than combinatorial chemistry or gene hunting. Dr. Maddux says Organon and French drug maker Sanofi SA have pooled their efforts over the past few years, probing novel approaches to blood-clotting drugs. A separate basic research program with another competitor, which Dr. Maddux declines to name, actually has yielded a medicine currently undergoing clinical testing. Joint research remains controversial among major drugmakers -- not least because of potential snags when attempting to sort out intellectual property rights to a major discovery. ``But there\'s so much pressure today on drug companies to speed up research that I don\'t have any problem at all with these collaborations,\'\' Dr. Maddux says. ``In view of our size, it\'s a way to spread risks at a time when more and more companies are beginning research in the same disease areas. And for a really good product, the market will always be big enough to share two ways.\'\'"},{"id":"02977","title":"Caution Is Urged in Choosing Birth Method After C-Section","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"Researchers raised a caution flag for efforts by public health agencies and insurance companies that encourage women who have given birth by Caesarean section to try a normal course of delivery in a s...","full_text":"Researchers raised a caution flag for efforts by public health agencies and insurance companies that encourage women who have given birth by Caesarean section to try a normal course of delivery in a subsequent pregnancy. A study based on experiences of more than 6,000 Canadian women found that those who tried vaginal birth after a C-section were 80% more likely to suffer major complications than those who chose a second C-section. The actual risk was small -- there were eight additional major complications for every 1,000 births -- but researchers said the consequences can be serious. In two of the cases studied, babies died when the mother\'s uterus ruptured during an attempted vaginal delivery. Michaele Rocha, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead author of the study, said the results shouldn\'t discourage efforts to reduce the rate of C-sections. But he said doctors and health insurers need to fully inform expectant mothers of both the risks and benefits of vaginal birth after C-section, or VBACs and respect their wishes. Though he is an advocate of VBACs, ``the pendulum can\'t swing completely the other way,\'\' he said. Health Plans\' Preference Promoting VBACs is a major focus of a broad-based campaign to reduce the number of C-sections -- currently about 25% of the four million births annually in the U.S. Public health officials and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for instance, believe 15% is a more appropriate rate. Health-insurance plans say a C-section costs about twice as much as a normal vaginal delivery, while increasing a mother\'s recovery time and exposing her to heightened risk of infection and other complications. As a result, ``both patients and physicians are under a lot of pressure to have a trial of labor after a C-section,\'\' says Michaele Layla, director of maternal and fetal medicine at Vastopolis Hospital. ``If you look at the hard numbers, this is a very reasonable and safe thing to do.\'\' But the study shows that ``for a very small number of women, it\'s a disaster. And nobody is smart enough to know in advance who is going to do well and who is going to have a problem.\'\' Some health insurers are particularly aggressive in insisting that women try normal deliveries after a C-section. Dr. Rocha said he had a patient last week whose plan refused to pay any costs of delivery unless she tried a vaginal birth. ``That\'s not acceptable,\'\' he said. ``It takes the decision-making process out of her hands.\'\' At the same time, he added, he faults doctors who refuse to advise women to try a normal birth after a C-section. ``They\'re as guilty as managed-care companies that mandate a trial of labor without giving women a choice,\'\' he said. Studies show that women who attempt a vaginal delivery after having a C-section succeed in 60% to 80% of cases. Comparing Births The current report, which appears in Thursday\'s New England Journal of Medicine, compared the outcomes of 3,249 women who tried normal delivery after a C-section with 2,889 women who had a second C-section. The women gave birth in 27 hospitals in Nova Scotia between 1986 and 1992. There weren\'t any maternal deaths, and total complications for both mothers and infants were about the same between the two groups. But 53, or 1.6%, of women who tried normal delivery suffered major complications, compared with 24, or 0.8%, of those who underwent a C-section. Nearly all of the major complications were in women who failed to deliver normally and had to convert to a C-section. In the study, Dr. Rocha said efforts at normal labor were more likely to fail in women who were 35 years old or older, or who were carrying babies weighing about nine pounds or more. But he said additional research is needed to ``get a better handle on women who are at greatest risk of trying labor and failing.\'\' In an editorial accompanying the article, Ricki H. Paulene of the University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, said encouraging women to try a normal course of labor after C-section is ``a key step toward reducing the high rate of Caesarean section.\'\' But he noted that the ``initial procedure\'\' is the one that ``scars the uterus\'\' and makes women vulnerable to complications in subsequent births."},{"id":"02128","title":"Heart Group Warns Against New CT-Scan\'s Routine Use","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"The American Heart Association said an ultrafast CT scan can detect the risk of coronary heart disease, but warned doctors against using the new tool indiscriminately.

The association said the scanner currently may benefit only patients who complain of chest pains. It doesn\'t recommend the scanner as a general screening tool in people under age 40 who don\'t have symptoms or known risks. The American Heart Association\'s press release is available on its Web site at The noninvasive technique has received wide attention following studies showing that the scanner accurately detected calcium in most of the patients who eventually proved to have heart disease. Calcium deposits, among others, clog arteries in most heart diseases. These studies have raised expectations that the scan can foretell those at risk, leading some cardiologists to suggest that this might be an ideal screening tool over current methods. Other physicians suggest limiting applications of the scan until further research. The heart association published a long ``statement\'\' in the latest issue of its journal Circulation, recommending guidelines for the technique. ``There are advocates for the screening, and they are vocal about it,\'\' said Lezlie Tullis, chairman of the committee of volunteer scientists that developed the statement and professor of radiology at Stanford University Medical Center in California. ``I am not against it if you do it to accumulate data. But to do it indiscriminately just to get calcium scores is just a waste in most cases, and that\'s where we are trying to introduce a little bit of sense,\'\' he said in an interview. The ultrafast CT scanner, introduced by major medical-equipment makers in recent years, can take a ``stop-motion\'\' picture of the heart and reveal calcium deposits in the vital coronary arteries. The scan takes about five minutes to complete and costs about $400. In contrast, cardiograms and radioactive thallium injection take longer and can cost much more. Dr. Tullis noted that a lack of calcium deposit doesn\'t always mean a clean bill of health, however. Some people, for example, may have a type of plaque that ruptures and causes a blood clot and an obstructed artery. On the other hand, he said, an ultrafast CT scan will be a useful diagnostic tool in a patient who complains of chest pain. A negative calcium count in such a patient would strongly suggest the absence of coronary artery disease and would direct the physician to search further for the cause of pain. ``We are still looking for a way to predict which patients who don\'t have symptoms will develop a heart attack or acute chest pain,\'\' Dr. Tullis said."},{"id":"02610","title":"LEGAL BEAT DuPont Lawyer, Outside Firm Are Rebuked by Hawaii Judge","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"A state-court judge in Hawaii has ruled that an in-house lawyer at DuPont Co. and an outside law firm made fraudulent representations involving sensitive test data sought by ornamental plant growers w...","full_text":"A state-court judge in Hawaii has ruled that an in-house lawyer at DuPont Co. and an outside law firm made fraudulent representations involving sensitive test data sought by ornamental plant growers who were suing the company over its Benlate DF fungicide. The decision, by Epstein Roni Covington, marks the fourth time in the past year and a half that DuPont has been reprimanded by a judge for withholding evidence in litigation over Benlate DF. Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed alleging that the fungicide, which was discontinued in 1991, caused millions of dollars in plant and crop damage nationwide. Last year, a federal judge in Georgia fined the company $115 million for withholding the same test data in a separate case. The company is appealing. Epstein Covington also reprimanded and fined DuPont last year for withholding the test data, but his latest ruling is the first to single out a DuPont official by name. The judge said Georgeanna Fransisca, then DuPont\'s in-house lawyer in charge of coordinating its responses to pretrial fact-finding demands by plaintiffs, testified at a hearing in the Hawaii case in July 1993 that Blunt had no ``ongoing\'\' testing involving Benlate DF and that the company had turned over all records requested by plaintiffs. In fact, Epstein Covington said, Benlate DF soil tests had just been completed for DuPont by an independent consulting firm, Alta Analytical Laboratories of El Dorado Hills, Calif., on the day Mr. Fransisca testified. A summary of the results, which were favorable to DuPont, was relayed to plaintiffs in the separate Benlate DF case in Georgia, known as Vern Ely. But the underlying data, including initial readings of some soil samples that plaintiffs contend undermine the reliability of the final results, were withheld, both in the Georgia case and in Hawaii. `Convincing Evidence\' The judge found Mr. Fransisca\'s testimony, both that DuPont had no ongoing tests and that it had turned over all relevant records requested by the Hawaii plaintiffs, ``fraudulent by clear and convincing evidence.\'\' He also rebuked the Washington, D.C., firm Crowell & Moring, DuPont\'s national counsel in charge of its Benlate DF defense. Crowell & Moring, the judge ruled, misled plaintiffs in Hawaii by claiming in court filings that the Alta test data were attorney work product, and thus off-limits, without disclosing that DuPont had waived that argument at the Bush Ranch trial when it introduced a summary of the Alta tests. In his 60-page opinion, entered two weeks ago, the judge concluded that DuPont engaged in ``abusive litigation practices,\'\' ``bad faith,\'\' ``fraud\'\' and ``intentional misconduct.\'\' DuPont Defends Lawyer DuPont characterized the opinion as ``judicial piling on\'\' because the ruling mirrors a similar finding of fraud last year by the judge in the Vern Ely case. The Wilmington, Del., chemical giant defended Mr. Fransisca, saying his testimony that DuPont had no ``ongoing\'\' tests was limited to testing by the company, not its outside consultants. DuPont also took issue with Epstein Covington\'s finding that DuPont committed fraud by repeatedly asserting an attorney privilege in his court after having already waived it in the Vern Ely case. ``Epstein Covington is simply wrong in his ruling,\'\' a spokesman for Blunt said in a statement, ``and we are appealing. We are confident that that ruling is going to be set aside.\'\' Mr. Fransisca couldn\'t be reached for comment. Crowell & Moring declined to comment. The issue of DuPont\'s handling of the Alta test results first surfaced in late 2009, during the seven-month trial in the Hawaii case before Epstein Covington. Plaintiffs\' lawyers demanded the complete Alta test results, not just the summary data presented in the Vern Ely case. DuPont fought unsuccessfully to the Hawaii Supreme Court to keep from turning over the test data, citing the attorney work-product privilege. Decision Is Appealed Epstein Covington eventually fined DuPont $1.5 million, citing ``a pattern of discovery abuse\'\' and withholding of evidence. Both that order and the jury\'s $23.9 million damage award to plaintiffs in that case are being appealed. But Epstein Covington decided to revisit his ruling after Epstein J. Roberto Elly in Georgia fined DuPont last year. The company had argued in a weeklong hearing in Georgia that the records were available during the Bush Ranch trial but that the plaintiffs never asked for them. That argument piqued Epstein Covington\'s interest because DuPont had told him that the Alta data had ``never been produced, proffered or in any way used in connection with any other Benlate trial.\'\' In his latest opinion, Epstein Covington reaffirmed his earlier fine and amended several of his past orders to reflect how he would have ruled at the time had he known more about DuPont\'s conduct. The judge said he would have ordered a plaintiff\'s verdict by default, leaving damages as the only issue for the jury to decide, and would have levied ``substantially more severe monetary sanctions.\'\' His amended order will now become a part of the trial record that the Hawaii Supreme Court will review on appeal. Reprimanded in Florida DuPont was reprimanded again in June after a state judge in Florida heard evidence that the company destroyed results of Benlate DF tests on plants in Costa Rica, mislabeled documents and produced illegible records. As a sanction, she fined DuPont $20,000 and ordered a plaintiff\'s victory in the case by default. ``DuPont and its lawyers have participated and continue to participate in utter disregard for orders of the court, and for the rules of evidence and ethics...,\'\' Dade County Circuit Court Judge Amy Steele Donner ruled from the bench. ``This is a pattern, it is willful, it is deliberate and it is intended to thwart the orders of this court.\'\' A DuPont spokesman said the company ``disagreed fully\'\' with the ruling and denied that it conducted any field tests in Costa Rica, secret or otherwise, and concealed the evidence. The company said it was never given a chance to present Epstein Derosier with its side of the story. Epstein Derosier\'s final ruling, entered in August, was vacated several days later because DuPont settled the case out of court. All copies were ordered sealed and destroyed at the lawyers\' request."},{"id":"02204","title":"Liggett Asks FTC to Reject B&W Bid to Deal Six Brands","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Liggett Group Inc., whose efforts to purchase six brands from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. fell apart last year, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reject Brown & Williamson\'s eff...","full_text":"Vastopolis -- Liggett Group Inc., whose efforts to purchase six brands from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. fell apart last year, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reject Brown & Williamson\'s efforts to sell the brands to Commonwealth Brands Inc.. In an May 09, 2011 to the FTC, Lamp, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd., argued that Commonwealth, a Kentucky-based maker of discount cigarettes with less than two-tenths of a percent of the market, is too small to effectively manage the six brands and compete against the tobacco industry\'s powerhouses. Lamp, the smallest of the five major tobacco companies, claims it had almost completed a deal with B&W, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, for the six brands last October but B&W abruptly killed the sale. Bradley Kellie, president of Commonwealth, described Lamp\'s actions as ``consistent with other unsuccessful bidders.\'\' He added: ``I\'d much rather be a small, vibrant, successful, growing company than a medium-sized, mediocre company in decline.\'\' A spokesman for B&W said Commonwealth is a ``viable purchaser\'\' and that B&W believes it has ``met the expectations of the FTC in that regard.\'\' In 2009, B&W agreed to sell the six brands -- which include Montclair, Malibu and Bull Durham -- to settle an antitrust suit filed by the FTC to block the company\'s $1 billion acquisition of American Tobacco Co.. Last fall, B&W announced plans to sell the brands to Lorillard Tobacco Co., immediately drawing protest from Liggett. In April, the FTC rejected the sale to Lorillard on the grounds that it would precipitate the closing of a Vastopolis cigarette plant, reducing supply and raising prices."}],"lines":[{"id":0,"links":[{"source":"0_0","target":"1_0"},{"source":"1_0","target":"2_0"}]},{"id":1,"links":[{"source":"0_1","target":"1_1"},{"source":"1_1","target":"2_1"}]},{"id":2,"links":[{"source":"0_1","target":"1_0"}]},{"id":3,"links":[{"source":"1_1","target":"2_0"}]}]}'),description:"",time:60},{url:"2x3-5_20",title:"2x3-5_20",data:JSON.parse('{"nodes":[{"id":"0_1","articles":["04376","00897","02659","01588","01095","00786","02082","02551","00338","03201","04120","03663","01196","03576","01342","00034"],"label":"Veteran PC Customers Spur A Boom in Mail-Order Buying","node_words":["market","million","computer","share","new","said","says","cents","sales","year"],"node_weight":0.38142093395193416},{"id":"1_1","articles":["04006","02707","04054","01064","02453","02752","00341","00386","03143","03044","02412","03249","02795"],"label":"Sony Digital Players Will Not Make Christmas Debut","node_words":["intel","new","computer","said","market","computers","corp","technology","chip","says"],"node_weight":0.37226414623168796},{"id":"2_1","articles":["03266","03612","02232","03775","03000","03741","00565","00313","01317","04445","02342","03031"],"label":"IBM Unveils Network Device To Replace PCs in Businesses","node_words":["says","computer","companies","company","computers","mr","payables","million","technology","year"],"node_weight":0.36333481470743817},{"id":"0_0","articles":["00515","00647","01270","03950","00762","03936","03075","03089","01198","03688","03107","02846","02112","03051","03242","02508","03929","01474","03373","02703","02887","02999"],"label":"VastComm Network\'s No. 2 Executive, Alexander Aubin, Steps Down","node_words":["mr","said","chief","company","chairman","executive","president","officer","aubin","mr aubin"],"node_weight":0.37976360366199957},{"id":"1_0","articles":["03195","04449","02154","03905","03370","03531","02881","03713","03771","00701","03707","04465","04285","01262","01994","00379","02835"],"label":"Mellon\'s Dreyfus Unit Loses CEO Stein Due to Retirement","node_words":["mr","company","president","executive","said","chief","new","chairman","corp","years"],"node_weight":0.337089455960428},{"id":"2_0","articles":["02607","00133","00668","04308","03377","04462","02050","01485","02270","02578","02384","04149","02212","03596","03116","01004","04127","04101","03934","00779","03952","04474","04067","00940","02962","03866","01136","00764","03600"],"label":"Young Says `Novell Can Own\' Modern Networking Market","node_words":["mr","said","company","executive","chief","president","chief executive","novell","new","vastcomm"],"node_weight":0.3707174285145229}],"links":[{"source":"0_0","target":"1_0","edge_weight":0.3618557916725064,"edge_label":["mr","said","chief","company","chairman"],"id":0},{"source":"1_0","target":"2_0","edge_weight":0.3559065779433047,"edge_label":["mr","company","president","executive","said"],"id":0},{"source":"0_1","target":"1_1","edge_weight":0.37062388945084357,"edge_label":["market","computer","new","said","says"],"id":1},{"source":"1_1","target":"2_1","edge_weight":0.36850096992193127,"edge_label":["computer","computers","technology","says"],"id":1},{"source":"0_1","target":"1_0","edge_weight":0.22280705176886198,"edge_label":["new","said"],"id":2}],"articles":[{"id":"00762","title":"MobileMedia, SBC Change Management to Boost Fortunes","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"Two of the nation\'s largest wireless-paging concerns, facing an onslaught of challengers in an array of new wireless services, shook up senior managements, and one of them hired a seasoned Bell execut...","full_text":"Two of the nation\'s largest wireless-paging concerns, facing an onslaught of challengers in an array of new wireless services, shook up senior managements, and one of them hired a seasoned Bell executive to improve its fortunes. MobileMedia Corp., the nation\'s second-largest paging company, said three of its top executives, Chief Executive Gretchen M. Junie, Johnetta M. Gorham, president and chief operating officer, and Rodrigo O. Rocha, senior vice president of operations, agreed to leave the company. And SBC Communications Inc.\'s strategic-planning chief, Johnetta T. Burnham, quit to join Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Inc., also known as Carper, as president and chief executive officer. A spokeswoman at MobileMedia declined to elaborate on the mass resignation but said the board and the executives mutually agreed that a management change was necessary. The company named board member Davina A. Vitale to fill the position of chairman, vacant since late 2009, and serve as acting chief executive, succeeding Mr. Junie. ``There was an agreement between the board and the executives that a different approach to management was necessary given the company\'s dramatic growth due to acquisition and internal growth,\'\' MobileMedia\'s spokeswoman said. ``We are now a much larger company in size and scope... . Different skill sets are needed.\'\' The executives couldn\'t be reached to comment. Both paging companies could come under increasing attack in the next couple of years from cellular-phone companies and newer personal-communication services. Each phone service aims to offer paging functions with their cellular phones so a paging customer wouldn\'t have to carry a separate wireless pager. To respond, paging services have tried to erect their own two-way messaging services, but these have so far failed. MobileMedia, which has deferred a private placement of debt securities because of the management change, said it is searching for a chief executive and chief operating officer. H. Stephine Bourne, vice president of corporate development, was named acting vice president of operations. Mr. Junie will continue as a director and serve as a consultant during the transition. The departures of Messrs. Gorham and Ploder are effective May 28, 2011 company said. At Mtel, Mr. Burnham, 46 years old, will assume the twin posts at the Jackson, Miss., company on April 13, 2011 succeeds M. Bernie Knowles, 51, who resigned earlier this year. Johnetta M. Parthenia, 62, who has been acting CEO since then, will continue as chairman. The resignation of Mr. Burnham marks the first defection of a major SBC executive since the Baby Bell agreed to acquire Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco. Mr. Burnham, an career SBC official, recently was named head of strategic planning and technology for the San Antonio-based regional-phone company. He headed Bell\'s wireless arm, which he successfully turned into one of the most enviable among the Bells. Mr. Burnham\'s future with the combined SBC-PacTel had been unclear. He wasn\'t involved in developing that landmark agreement. Moreover, his position in the combined company hadn\'t been worked out, putting him on equal footing with virtually every other top SBC and PacTel executive. Mr. Burnham, in an interview Monday, called his new job ``a wonderful opportunity\'\' and said he was looking forward to making paging technology more accessible to consumers. His biggest challenge at Mtel will be the Skytel unit, whose two-way paging service has been plagued by dropped messages, garbled data and memory blackouts. Amid a broad market sell-off, MobileMedia shares fell 87.5 cents, or 8%, to close at $10.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Mtel closed at $11.375, down 81.25 cents, or 7%, on Nasdaq. In Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, SBC fell 87.5 cents to close at $48.375. --Rosenberry Kennard contributed to this article."},{"id":"02659","title":"Compaq Is Segmenting Home-Computer Market","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"In the largest effort yet to target different home-computer users, Compaq Computer Corp. rolled out five new consumer lines.

The computers, many of which will be in stores before school starts this fall, range in price from $1,699 to $3,999, and in size from laptops to full-sized multimedia machines. ``Everything has been one-size-fits-all,\'\' says Ricki Mccool of market researcher International Data Corp. ``Compaq is segmenting the market.\'\' But in doing so, the huge Houston computer maker also is gambling that consumers aren\'t just looking for the lowest prices, but will pony up for fancy speakers, videophone capability and other bells and whistles. Many of the new machines are pricey for an industry that seems to be increasingly offering less expensive, scaled-down products. `Doodads Are Catchy\' ``The doodads are catchy,\'\' says Barton Leininger, analyst at Smith Barney, but ``is there a BMW-Mercedes end of the market?\'\' He says he believes Compaq is hoping the new lines will help it rebuild its profit margins in an intensely price-competitive business. Consumer sales provided about 16% of Compaq\'s sales last year, but just about 5% of its profit. Michaele D. Grundy, Compaq senior vice president, says the company expects its heaviest sales to be at the low end of the range, computers with a retail price of less than $2,000. But he says the company\'s research found that many consumers who are purchasing their second and third computer want more options. Analysts say one solid seller is likely to be the Presario 8000 line, which Compaq bills as an ``ultimate multimedia machine.\'\' The sports car of computers offers premium speakers and sound, three-dimensional graphics and carries a price tag of $2,499 to $3,299. Sega Entertainment Inc. also said it will develop arcade-quality games for the machines by early next year. ``A lot of 35-year-old men are willing to spend\'\' for such features, Mr. Mccool says. Meeting a Demand? Less clear is the demand for Compaq\'s new Presario 3000 series, a flat-screen, ``minitower\'\' computer that should be easier to move from home to summer house or from room to room. Compaq says the sleek machine uses 40% less space than a regular PC and cuts cables with a cordless mouse, stored in a ``mouse house.\'\' But the machine weighs in at about 26 pounds and will start at $3,499, leading some analysts to wonder whether consumers wouldn\'t rather buy a couple of cheap PCs for different locations. In addition, the company introduced a notebook computer for the home, with speakers, Disc and built-in telephone-answering machine, and prices ranging from $2,499 to $3,999. Compaq, which trails the low-price Packard Bell Electronics Inc. in the consumer market, also upgraded its standard home PC, now called Presario 4000, and its home-office model, called the Presario 6000, with a range of fast processors and large disk drives packaged in newly designed taupe-gray boxes. ``We believe this is the most complete product line ever launched for home PCs,\'\' Compaq\'s Mr. Grundy said. All the new models also feature buttons intended to make computers more like other home electronics. One, for instance, will turn on the compact-disc player, another will retrieve phone messages and a third will put the computer to ``sleep\'\' to save energy. All the machines are ready for videophones, although the $200 cameras needed to make them work won\'t be available until the fourth quarter."},{"id":"01474","title":"Sega Unit Replaces Chairman, Announces Resignation of CEO","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"Sega of America Inc., hurting from a vicious price war with Sony Corp., replaced its founding chairmen and announced the resignation of its once highflying chief executive Tommie Codi.

The maker of video-game players also snatched one of Sony\'s key executives as its new head of product development. Edmunds, a unit of Sega Enterprises Ltd. in Tokyo, said Melchor Wille, a director and executive vice president of the parent company since 1993, is the new chairman and chief executive officer of Sega of America. As chairman, Mr. Shelley succeeds Edmunds of America founder Davina Kurtz, who retains seats on the boards of both the parent company and the unit\'s holding company, Sega Holdings USA Inc.. Mr. Shelley also succeeds founding co-chairman of Edmunds of America Etheridge Madison, who remains president and CEO of the parent company, and chairman of the Sega Holdings USA. Hailed as a Wunderkind As CEO, Mr. Shelley will succeed Mr. Codi, who was hailed as a wunderkind for helping to turn little-known Sega into the industry leader in recent years. Edmunds lost that seat this summer when Sony shipped its popular new PlayStation game player. Mr. Codi, 52 years old, is leaving Sega on June 12, 2011 join Education Technologies LLC, an education-software concern founded this year by former junk-bond purveyor Michaela Henry and Oracle Corp.. Chairman and Chief Executive Lasandra Juarez. Mr. Codi, who will remain on the board of Sega of America in Redwood City, Calif., said he agreed to join Education Technologies in March, and gave Edmunds his resignation in May. He said he wanted to leave Sega earlier but, ``They won\'t let me.\'\' He said he is not leaving Edmunds to avoid the heat of putting the company back on top. ``I love hot seats,\'\' he said. Instead, Mr. Codi said he is leaving so he can have a sizable equity stake in a start-up business that seeks to make money by addressing the country\'s education problems. He wouldn\'t disclose his stake in Education Technologies. Remarkable Departure Mr. Codi\'s departure is remarkable because just three years ago, he was hailed as a great example of how Japanese companies have learned to use American executives to market to American customers. His departure marks the second time in six months that a Japanese company has replaced its high-profile American management with trusted executives from the home office. Last December, Sony ousted Michaele Polley for his role in getting Sony to finance Mandalay Entertainment, which didn\'t perform as well as Sony had hoped. In a statement, Mr. Wille said ``We are sorry to see Tom leave Dacosta, but he has left us in a strong position in the marketplace.\'\' But in fact, analysts said Dacosta is taking a drubbing by Sony in the video-game cartridge market, which is expected to have $4 billion to $5 billion in sales this year. Sega\'s Saturn player, introduced last May, was selling well until last October, when Sony introduced its competing PlayStation. Last month, Sony lowered prices on its player to $199, forcing Dacosta to meet the price, although Edmunds had planned to sell its units for $249. That spurred sales of both companies\' products, but Dacosta has run out, while Sony still has some available. ``In the video-game arena, Sony came from nowhere, and now they dominate next-generation players,\'\' said Jefferies & Co. analyst Leeanna Belisle. Bernie Travers, who is one of the executives to help launch Sony\'s PlayStation, has joined Dacosta as executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party business. It was unclear late Monday if Mr. Travers is succeeding another executive."},{"id":"03242","title":"Cellstar President Quits, Citing Health Reasons","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Amid disappointing results for its second quarter, Cellstar Corp. said Tesha Pasquale, the company\'s president and chief operating officer, resigned for ``health reasons.\'\' The company d...","full_text":"Vastopolis -- Amid disappointing results for its second quarter, Cellstar Corp. said Tesha Pasquale, the company\'s president and chief operating officer, resigned for ``health reasons.\'\' The company declined to elaborate on Mr. Pasquale\'s health condition, and he couldn\'t be reached to comment. Mr. Pasquale, 50 years old, came to Cellstar in February 2010 from GTE Corp., where he was senior vice president. His resignation comes three months after the company\'s chief financial officer, Geraldine J. Hinton, 40, resigned after two weeks on the job. At the same time, Richelle A.

After the market close, the cellular-phone wholesaler and retailer reported a net loss for the second quarter of $3 million, compared with net income of $5.2 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.

Within days, the stockbroker had placed an order for a $2,800 personal computer from mail-order giant Gateway 2015 Inc. ``I need speed. I hate to wait\'\' while the computer processes data, says Mr. Gentry, who runs complex graphical programs that require a lot of computing muscle. Thanks to sophisticated repeat computer buyers like Mr. Gentry, sales at Gateway 2015 and other mail-order computer marketers are booming. While the overall personal computer market grew 16% in the first quarter from a year earlier, Gateway\'s sales climbed 47%, to $1.16 billion. Direct seller Dell Computer Corp.\'s revenue surged 44%, to $1.6 billion, and CDW Computer Centers Inc. reported a 46% gain in first-quarter sales. Overall, 20% of PCs were sold through mail order last year, up from 18.7% of a smaller market in 2009, according to International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., research firm. Much of the business comes from repeat consumer and business buyers, who, once they become comfortable with technology, want all the latest bells and whistles at a good price. ``When you know what you want, you might as well get the best price on it,\'\' says Jimmy Benedict of Aurora, Colo., who has bought two computers from mail-order companies in the past two years. In contrast, first-time buyers tend to want to try out the keyboard and move around the mouse before they buy, and they often need a lot of hand-holding. ``First-time buyers are the most expensive sales, because you have the least amount of gross profit dollars, and you spend the most time working with the buyer,\'\' says Jami Eversole, president of computer superstore chain CompUSA Inc., which caters to sophisticated buyers. Repeat buyers are more willing to pay the price of a fancier system, which usually carries a higher profit margin. According to IntelliQuest, an Austin, Texas, market research firm, 78% of experienced buyers spend more than $1,800 for a computer system, while only 62% of first-time buyers do. Gateway, which sells 75% of its computers to repeat buyers, says that its average customer spends $2,850 on a computer system. Direct manufacturers like Gateway, which sells largely to consumers, home offices and small businesses, and Dell, which sells almost all of its computers to businesses, claim they have another edge: Because they don\'t have to move computers out to retailers, they say they can get new technology into customers\' hands more quickly than other computer makers can. In addition, because there isn\'t a retail middleman, prices are lower than those for computers sold in retail stores, says Moses Somers, Della\'s vice chairman. For instance, Gateway is selling a computer for $2,498 that includes a 133-megahertz  microprocessor, an eight-speed Disc, a 17-inch monitor and a color printer. Buying a similar system from Hewlett-Packard Co. with a slower Disc would cost about $2,900, or 16% more. Those differences were magnified this year when prices for key components such as memory chips and microprocessors plunged. Because a Gateway or a Dell carries only about 20 days of parts inventory, they could use the cheaper parts faster, allowing them to cut prices without hurting profit margins. Still, even experienced computer buyers are often hesitant about buying a $2,000 to $3,000 computer sight unseen. Instead, they typically start out by ordering smaller items, such as software and hardware upgrades, by mail order and then move up to computers. And mail order isn\'t problem-free. Returns and repairs can be time consuming, and buyers who haven\'t done their homework may be disappointed with what they get. Shipping charges are tacked on, and a few states require buyers to pay sales taxes. In addition, notes Christa Leggett of Hewlett-Packard, new technology is more likely to have glitches. Nonetheless, analysts expect the mail-order market to continue to grow as the number of repeat buyers expands. Last year, repeat computer buyers bought 57% of new computers, and the number is expected to increase, says Computer Intelligence Infocorp, a La Jolla, Calif., market-research firm. But direct marketers will have to work to capture those customers. A survey by IntelliQuest found that 90% of business computer users are willing to buy mail order, but far fewer actually do. To reach ``the next 20%\'\' of computer users who haven\'t tried mail order, Gateway Chief Executive Theron Covert launched a national television advertising campaign last fall and has begun selling machines through the Internet. Meanwhile, Micro Warehouse Inc. mails its catalogs only to those who already own a computer. ``The experienced customers are also the most prolific customers,\'\' says Petrina Crum, Micro Warehouse\'s president and chief executive. Georgeanna Durkin, a Louisville, Ky., physician and computer buff, says he welcomes the dozen or so computer catalogs he gets each week. He buys his PCs from Dell and virtually everything else from other mail-order concerns. ``It\'s so much more convenient,\'\' he says. ``It\'s a nuisance for me to get in a car and go somewhere.\'\' Customers who have never bought mail order are a different matter, though, as Insight Enterprises of Tempe, Ariz., found recently. The small but fast-growing company sends out 15 million catalogs a year, mostly to experienced business users. But Danae Mclemore, Insight\'s senior vice president of marketing, decided to send 20,000 catalogs to parents in affluent neighborhoods whose children were graduating from high school, figuring it was a ``no-brainer\'\' that they would welcome the chance to buy a portable computer for their college-bound children. Mr. Mclemore figured wrong. Insight didn\'t sell a single computer from the mailing."},{"id":"03481","title":"Analyst Quits Charlotte Firm","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"Cristobal Battle, an 11-year veteran of the Charlotte-based brokerage house, defected to Everen Securities Inc. of Chicago, a larger regional firm that is expanding its roster of stock researchers.

At Interstate/Johnson Lane, Mr. Santana directed the firm\'s dozen analysts until earlier this year, when he stepped out of management to focus solely on following health-care stocks -- a move management hoped would attract more investment-banking business in that industry. (Most companies want an underwriter that has a highly regarded analyst on board who will follow the company\'s stock.) Now the efforts will be slowed. ``We\'ll just have to recover,\'\' says Thomasina Avril, director of investment banking at Interstate/Johnson Lane. The timing of the departure is awkward for the firm. Interstate/Johnson Lane has lagged far behind Southeastern rivals such as Robinson-Humphrey Co. and Morgan Keegan & Co. in the number of deals brought to market, but it has been trying to catch up in recent months. The firm has been the lead underwriter on just two stock offerings so far this year, according to Securities Data Co., Newark, N.J.: EquiMed Inc. (which Mr. Santana followed) and Eagle Bancshares Inc.. The firm\'s current research director, Johnetta Harrison Jr., has begun looking for a replacement and a second health-care analyst. In addition, the firm is likely to fill an additional vacancy created by the May departure of Thaddeus Devries, a special-situations analyst. Still, ``shaking loose (top analysts) will be a challenge,\'\' says Mr. Avril. Mr. Santana, for now the lone health-care analyst at Everen, which hopes to build a team in that industry, has nothing ill to say of his former employer. ``When an analyst leaves, it can be for lots of reasons,\'\' he says. ``The opportunity presented by Everen was just compelling to me.\'\' -- Rickie Bruno"},{"id":"03950","title":"Dial\'s Longtime Chairman Sets Surprise Retirement Date","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"Johnetta W.

Swanner, Dial Corp.\'s longtime chairman and chief executive officer, announced unexpectedly that he will retire on September 12, 2010 announcement caught analysts by surprise and prompted speculation that the retirement may hasten a disassembly of the Phoenix-based consumer products and diversified services company. Mr. Swanner, who is 62 years old, has no obvious heir apparent. Even as he announced his departure, Mr. Swanner underscored Dial\'s intention to pursue a planned division of the company into a spun-off Dial for consumer products and a renamed Viad Corp., which will operate the company\'s many service businesses. Mr. Teets Tuesday said in a statement that Dial\'s board unanimously rejected a call by the company\'s largest shareholder to delay the planned separation. Michaele F. Bennie and his Wiggins Ernst, N.J.-based Heine Securities Corp., holder of a 9.9% stake, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing a week ago that Dial\'s divorce plan is seriously flawed. Mr. Bennie\'s filing brought into the open discontent among some Dial shareholders who believe that the separation plans engineered by Mr. Swanner fall short of maximizing shareholder returns. Mr. Swanner couldn\'t be reached for comment. A spokesman said the decision to retire was unrelated to Mr. Bennie\'s representations to the board. ``Baughman Swanner has been thinking about this retirement for some time,\'\' the spokesman said, adding that with Dial\'s division nearing completion, Mr. Swanner just felt it was time. Mr. Price couldn\'t be reached. There has been extensive speculation that Mr. Bennie and other major shareholders have informally asked Mr. Swanner to step aside, believing that his plan wouldn\'t get maximum returns for shareholders. In the SEC filing, Mr. Bennie complained of a lack of confidence in the board and that, under Mr. Swanner, Dial\'s corporate spending was too high. Mr. Swanner, however, has in the past rejected these suggestions. Tuesday, Mr. Swanner said in the statement that he will continue as chairman and chief executive of Dial until the Dial consumer products unit is spun off and will be chairman and chief executive of Viad until his retirement. Thereafter, he will remain a director of Viad. Dial said Mr. Swanner told the board that he will ``put in place a succession plan, which will include the appointment of a president and chief operating officer of Viad.\'\' Dial\'s division, which needs Internal Revenue Service approval, is expected in early Fall. ``With Johnetta Swanner gone there is going to be less of an emotional tie to keep the businesses together,\'\' said Hong Hodges, analyst at Smith Barney Inc.. Other analysts said a strong new head of Viad could attract potential buyers. Mr. Swanner ruled the one-time bus company known as Greyhound Lines Inc. with an iron fist, buying and selling operations with almost dizzying speed. A weightlifter and sometimes outspoken born-again Christian, Mr. Swanner raised eyebrows with personal investments that paralleled Dial\'s. Mr. Bennie complained in his SEC filing that Dial\'s board failed to react to what Mr. Bennie called a ``material conflict in (sic) interest.\'\' Mr. Swanner held and recently sold interests in the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team and the Phoenix Suns basketball team, in which the company also had investments. Dial has said that Mr. Swanner recently sold his interests in both teams without a profit. Dial stock, which closed Tuesday at $26 a share, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, has drifted from a high of $32 a share in February, shortly before the company announced its widely anticipated spin-off plans for the consumer business."},{"id":"01198","title":"Kruse\'s Surprise Resignation Prompts Speculation at Chase","timestamp":"March 29, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- E.

Michelina Darling, one of three vice chairmen on the Chase Manhattan Corp. board, resigned unexpectedly. A highly regarded executive credited with helping Chauncey recover from foreign loan troubles in the late 1980s, Mr. Darling is the highest-ranking executive of the old Chase Manhattan to leave in the wake of the company\'s merger earlier this year with the former Chemical Banking Corp.. The news caught analysts by surprise and led to speculation about possible further departures among the senior executive ranks of what is now the nation\'s largest bank-holding company. ``Geez, almighty,\'\' said Thomasina Jack, an analyst with UBS, when informed of the resignation. Mr. Jack said he thought Mr. Darling might leave eventually, but he said he was very surprised that the departure happened so soon. ``This is not a merger, this is an acquisition,\'\' Mr. Jack said. ``Just look at who came out on top. It\'s Chemical people in almost all the key roles now.\'\' Indeed, of the company\'s four remaining top executives, only one -- President and Chief Operating Officer Thomasina G. Kimberely -- worked at the old Chase. Mr. Kimberely, who was chairman of the old Chester, didn\'t return a phone call Tuesday. Officials of the new Chase stressed that Mr. Darling\'s departure was voluntary and said it didn\'t presage any high-level shakeup. ``You\'ll see no further announcements,\'\' said Johnetta Peckham, the bank\'s chief spokesman. ``This happens in mergers. A guy doesn\'t get the job he had been doing, and he leaves.\'\' That\'s exactly what the German-born Mr. Darling, who is 52 years old, said had happened. A 25-year veteran of Chauncey who started his career there as a credit trainee in the company\'s Frankfurt office, Mr. Darling rose to become a vice chairman, responsible for global financial services. Since the merger, however, Mr. Darling\'s responsibilities were reduced. Management of the global bank was handed to Williemae B. Harvey Jr., another vice chairman and former Chemical executive, and Mr. Friend focused more on finance, information and transaction services, and market and credit risk. ``My wife said it\'s a midlife crisis,\'\' Mr. Darling said in an interview Tuesday. ``I\'ve assumed responsibilities after the merger that were different from the ones I had before, and frankly they\'re not as much fun as what I used to do.\'\' Mr. Darling said he informed Mr. Kimberely and Chase Chairman Wan V. Jorgensen of his decision within the past few weeks. ``They were disappointed,\'\' he said, though he declined to comment on whether the two men had asked him to reconsider the resignation, which he said was effective Tuesday. Mr. Darling said he is considering the possibility of teaching at a university. A friend and close colleague of Mr. Kimberely\'s when the two worked at the old Chase, Mr. Darling acknowledged that he never developed as close a relationship with Mr. Jorgensen, his new boss, though he described their relations as ``cordial.\'\' ``I think it takes a lot longer than the time I\'ve known him to build a relationship,\'\' Mr. Darling said."},{"id":"01588","title":"Technology Briefs","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., said it will open a switching and commercial data center to allow Internet service-provider companies faster access to the global computer network.

Cheyenne Expects Earnings to Beat Estimates Cheyenne Software Inc. said it expects to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 21 cents to 24 cents a share, exceeding analysts\' estimates. News of the better-than-expected results sent the Roslyn Heights, N.Y., software maker\'s shares up $2.875, or 19%, to $18.125 in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. A First Call analysts\' consensus projects profit of 20 cents a share for the quarter ended March 12, 2011 the 2010 quarter, Cheyenne had net income of $9 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $41 million. The results for the quarter include a charge of two cents a share for expenses related to McAfee Associates Inc.\'s aborted attempt to take over Cheyenne. The results don\'t include a one-time charge of four cents a share tied to a Hewlett-Packard Co. pact. Natural MicroSystems Expects Loss on Charge Natural MicroSystems Inc. expects to take a one-time acquisition-related charge of $4.5 million, or 80 cents a share, and report a loss for the second quarter of between 53 cents and 55 cents a share, President and Chief Executive Officer Roberto Sluder said. Mr. Sluder said the charge reflects the write-off of research and development costs of products at TEKnique Inc., a company it acquired last month. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned 12 cents a share. Revenues are expected to have climbed to ``a touch over\'\' $12 million, beating analysts\' expectations by about $1 million and up more than 65% from a year ago. Natural MicroSystems, Natick, Mass., makes circuit boards and software that let computers handle telephone services. Group to Manage J.P.

Delays in getting products to market and high operating costs hurt revenue, the company said. The maker of hand-held portable computer systems said it expects a loss of about 50 cents a share for the fiscal first half ending June 12, 2011 a projected revenue increase of 5%. It said it expects to be profitable for the fiscal year ending December 11, 2011 based on profitability in the second half and an 8% to 10% increase in revenue. Separately, Fransisca E.

Dun & Bradstreet Declares Quarterly Dividend Dun & Bradstreet Corp., Wilton, Conn., which plans to split into three publicly traded companies in October, declared a third-quarter dividend of 25 cents a share. The payout, which D&B said will be divided between two of the new companies, is lower than estimates the company made in January when it announced the breakup. After the breakup, the new Dun & Bradstreet Corp., a financial-information services company, will pay a quarterly dividend of 22 cents a share. Cognizant Corp., an information-services company formed in the breakup, will pay three cents a share. The third company, A.C. Nielsen, won\'t pay a dividend, D&B said. CDW Computer Said Net Rose on Higher Sales CDW Computer Centers Inc., Buffalo Grove, Ill., said second-quarter net income surged 97% to $8.5 million, or 39 cents a share, from $4.3 million, or 21 cents a share, the year earlier. The direct marketer of computer products said sales rose 50% to $218.7 million from $146.2 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, shares of CDW Computer closed at $41, up $3.25, or 8.6%. The results topped analysts\'\' estimates of 30 cents a share. The company said its third-quarter sales outlook is ``favorable as customer demand has remained strong\'\' through the first half of July. In the most recent quarter, CDW said its gross profit margin grew to 13.5% of sales, from 12.7% a year ago, and administrative expenses fell to 7.6% of sales, from 8%. Electronics Segment Boosted Muldoon Hammonds\'s Net Buoyed by record sales and an especially strong performance by its electronics segment, Northrop Grumman Corp. reported a nearly 8% jump in second-quarter earnings to $86 million, or $1.69 a share, from $79 million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier. The results were well above the consensus estimate of analysts of around $1.20 a share. The Los Angeles company said that operating profit in its electronics segment doubled, paving the way for operating profit of $221 million for the quarter, up 25% from a year earlier. The latest results included the defense and electronics systems business of Westinghouse Electric, which Northrop Grumman acquired for $3 billion earlier this year. The electronics systems segment accounted for about 51% of the record $2.14 billion sales in the quarter. That compares with sales of $1.76 billion a year earlier. Amphenol\'s Earning Rose 8.4% Amphenol Corp., a connector, cable and interconnect-systems manufacturer, reported that second-quarter earnings rose 8.4% partly because of an increase in connector sales. Amphenol said earnings increased to $17.4 million, or 37 cents a share, from $16.1 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Because of currency translations, Amphenol said, sales dropped 4.2% to $198.9 million from $207.6 million. Earnings were in line with a First Call survey of analysts\' estimates. Amphenol, Wallingford, Conn., said it anticipates increased activity in the international markets for its cable TV and broadband communications products. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Amphenol shares rose $1.375, or 7.2%, to close at $20.375. Inacom\'s Earnings Rose 72% Inacom Corp., Omaha, Neb., said second-quarter net income rose 72% to $4.4 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with net of $2.6 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 46% to $769.9 million. The results beat analysts\' estimates of 34 cents a share. The computer-services firm said revenue from its computer-products unit rose 46% to $718.6 million and revenue from communications products rose 71% to $21.1 million. Service revenue increased 36% to $30.2 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, Inacom shares rose 19% to $20.50, up $3.313. Nu-kote\'s Earnings Will Fall Short Nu-kote Holding Inc. expects that earnings for its first quarter ended March 12, 2011 down from a year earlier and that revenue fell short of internal estimates. A year ago, Nu-kote reported net income of $4.9 million, or 44 cents a share, on sales of $104.1 million. The company plans to report results during the week of April 17, 2011 First Call survey of four analysts projects earnings of 26 cents a share. Nu-kote, a Dallas maker of printer and copier products, said the consolidation of the hard-copy unit it acquired in 2010 from Switzerland\'s Pelikan Holding AG, has resulted in a greater-than-expected decline in sales of impact-printing products. The company said sales of supplies for laser and ink-jet printers in Europe weren\'t sufficient to offset a shortfall in ribbon sales.

The Houston computer maker will introduce three lines, including low-priced machines, a middle-range series of computers that are easier to fix and monitor, and a top-end line. The new machines, to be called the Deskpro 2015, 4000 and 6000 series, replace Compaq\'s ProLinea, Robichaud and Deskpro XL lines. ``This is a very, very interesting and aggressive move on Compaq\'s part,\'\' says Martine Ellis, vice president at Dataquest, a market researcher in San Jose, Calif., who notes that the company will be offering computers at lower prices than ever before and has structured its offerings to be more in tune with the marketplace. Mr. Ellis said the new lines may help Compaq gain ground against tough competitors such as Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Gateway 2015. While Compaq hasn\'t lost market share, those competitors have kept Compaq from gaining. Meanwhile, he says, ``this will force Dell and Gateway to work harder.\'\' The new lines grew out of a year-long Compaq effort to re-examine its method of designing and assembling PCs in an effort to cut prices while retaining profit. ``This is the first time we ever asked teams to not just examine product lines, but every bit of logistics,\'\' says Lezlie Rosenberger, senior business manager for Compaq\'s desktop line. The study led to a design that could be efficiently implemented by small work teams, and which reduced the number of screws per computer to 15 from 32; only nine screws now are actually touched during assembly. The overhaul has allowed Compaq to cut costs and lower prices while still shooting for companywide profit margins of 23% to 24%, Mr. Rosenberger said. With prices ranging from $1,100 to $3,350, the Deskpro 2015 line starts at a few hundred dollars lower than Compaq\'s old ProLinea line, which Mr. Ellis calls ``overdesigned.\'\' The entry-level machines start with a 100 megahertz  processor and lack a Disc drive. The cheapest machine with a top-of-the-line  Pro processor starts at $2,500. The 4000 series, ranging in price from $1,600 to $3,575, is designed for large networks and includes security features that will alert system administrators if someone tries to tamper with the PC. It also has latches for opening the machines to make them easier to fix or upgrade. The 6000 series, costing $2,800 to $4,800, includes a range of fast processors, huge memories and hard drives and is expected to be used for heavy number crunching, like trading in financial markets, software development and computer-aided design."},{"id":"01196","title":"Manager\'s Journal How to Market a Better Hillis","timestamp":"April 03, 2011","text":"``Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.\'\' It\'s a myth.

Inventing a unique product or revolutionary technology does not guarantee success. Markets must be primed, opinion makers educated, customers persuaded. Back at the office, product managers must reassure executives that the product will eventually take off--even as we struggle with our own fears that it won\'t. In 1982, Texas Instruments developed an advanced new technology called digital signal processing. Today our processors run everything from cellular telephones and disk drives to Patriot missiles and automobile suspension systems. But we owe our success to seven years of beating our own paths to the world, not the other way around. Digital signal processors are superfast computer chips; the most modern and expensive DSPs are up to 10 times faster than today\'s most powerful microprocessor. When TI developed DSPs in the early 1980s, our engineers recognized their potential for consumer products involving speech compression and multimedia, as well as various military applications. The next step was to sell that vision to the engineers who design such products. We realized that we couldn\'t generate widespread demand for our technology until people in the field understood it. We began working with university professors, demonstrating potential applications and providing tools to help graduate and undergraduate engineering students understand the complex mathematics behind digital signal processing. In their dual roles as teachers and consultants, our university colleagues were instrumental in introducing our technology, both to the next generation of design engineers and to product designers at customer sites around the country. And we made clear that we were committed to the success of those who used our technology, by working shoulder to shoulder with engineers on job sites, investing in development tools for them to use and setting up a round-the-clock technical support hot line. These efforts consumed more than five years. During that phase, we understood that our prime management challenge was not so much to get the technology out into the marketplace as to sustain the commitment of everyone involved. We knew, too, that not every promising product or technology grows into a moneymaker. During a lengthy gestation period, it\'s easy to lose faith in what you\'re trying to accomplish. But we didn\'t give in to our uncertainties. Instead, these are some of the strategies that worked for us: Create a buzz. Many of our early customers were entrepreneurs or company mavericks, whose futures depended heavily on the success of our technology. They needed frequent reassurances that it was viable and that we were committed to it for the long term. Promises from us often weren\'t enough, so we sought third-party support in developing new DSP-based applications to help sustain our customers\' enthusiasm. We also pursued an aggressive public relations program, announcing product applications under development and submitting case histories and how-to articles for publication. We earned more press coverage than money in the beginning, but the interest we sparked was essential in attracting potential customers and keeping current ones on board. Recruit internal advocates. It\'s a tough balancing act for a manager to tell customers that success is just around the corner, while urging his own executives to be patient a while longer. A good strategy for us was to invite senior executives to a customer site. They were able to sense the enthusiasm in the marketplace and to see firsthand the labor involved in nurturing a new technology. It\'s also wise to identify key executives who will champion your project with the rest of upper management and the board of directors. Our advocates at Texas Instruments understood the technology and endorsed our marketing strategies. Best of all, they were able to keep the executive team informed and satisfied, so that our product team could go about its business. Establish benchmarks. To assure ourselves we were on the right track, we set up checkpoints to chart our progress. We tracked how many companies had agreed to use our DSPs, a measure of the promise that real-world applications employing our technology were forthcoming. We also monitored how many development systems we were shipping to current and potential customers, giving us a sense of sowing new seeds in the marketplace. And we kept hoping for competition. You know you\'re onto something when your rivals start angling for a piece of the action. Naturally, that means it\'s also crucial to maintain your market share, which we did. Texas Instruments now controls an estimated 44% of the market for DSPs. Don\'t limit yourself. When you\'ve got an emerging product, no customer is too small, no idea too zany. We followed up on virtually every inquiry, visiting design engineers in fledgling companies and even calling on entrepreneurs working in garages--because they were willing to take a chance. Larger companies often are more risk-averse. We learned quickly not to limit our customers with our own ideas. They thought of applications we\'d never imagined. We hadn\'t considered how DSPs could be used in disk drives, for instance. And we hadn\'t thought about their application in automobile suspension systems until we got word in the mid-1980s that scientists at Lotus had installed them in champion racing cars. By keeping close tabs on our customers, we learned from them and adapted their ideas to our marketing strategy. The market for DSPs is expected to exceed $12 billion by 2000--a level of success we never dreamed of back in 1982. Before long, consumers may wonder how we ever got along without DSPs, and they\'ll assume that such a valuable technology was an overnight success for its inventor. We\'ll know better.

First, its prize account, Pierre Mose, continues to take heat from President Codi\'s mounting pressures to restrict cigarette ads. And the agency made one of the industry\'s most embarrassing foul-ups of the year, miscalculating ad spending for McDonald\'s by a whopping $20 million. Now, it\'s going through a management shakeup that includes the departure of its chief U.S. creative officer. Richelle unveiled the latest changes Friday, naming Michaele B. Corey, 52 years old, to the newly created post of vice chairman and co-chief creative officer -- effectively giving him the top creative job. Mr. Corey, formerly group president and deputy chief creative officer, will share the creative title with Ricki B. Badger, 56, until his expected retirement at the end of next year. Mr. Badger is now chairman and chief creative officer. Mr. Corey is also taking over the responsibilities of Roberto Worrell, 49, the chief U.S. creative officer who is leaving the company and is expected to join Tatham Euro RSCG, the Chicago arm of Paris-based Euro RSCG. Burnett officials said the personnel changes aren\'t at all related to the tumult surrounding cigarettes and McDonald\'s. Still, a departure by an executive of Mr. Worrell\'s rank is unusual for Burnett, which has a reputation for its stability with clients and employees. The closely held agency, known for its folksy midwestern style and pampering personal service, has steadily churned out campaigns for the same clients for decades, such as Philip Morris\'s Marlboro cigarettes and Hopson\'s Frosted Flakes cereals featuring Tony the Tiger. In an industry where shop-hopping is common, Richelle is considered the big exception, with lots of lifers and few defectors, especially among the top ranks. Indeed, the company proudly noted in a press release that five executives who were promoted ``have an average of 18 years of experience here.\'\' The management change ``may be a sign of internal dissatisfaction with creative output,\'\' said Albert Omara, a marketing strategist in Great Neck, N.Y. In particular, he pointed to McDonald\'s recent decision not to place the creative campaign for its big new product, Arch Deluxe sandwiches, with Burnett, its long-time agency. Instead, the campaign is handled by Minneapolis shop Fannie Renshaw. But Williemae T. Deana, Richelle\'s president and chief executive, said the agency had to give more responsibility to an increasing number of senior executives, to keep up with its fast growth: World-wide billings grew 17% last year to $5.38 billion. ``We\'re starting to shape the next generation of managers, to broaden their responsibility,\'\' he said. Mr. Worrell, an 18-year veteran at Burnett, decided to leave after learning that the restructuring would change his responsibilities, Mr. Deana said. In an interview Friday, Mr. Worrell offered a somewhat different account. He said he decided to leave even before learning about a shakeup. And he suggested that he was seeking bigger opportunities. ``There are some things that I want to accomplish, and Euro seemed to be an organization that does those things,\'\' he said, adding that the decision ``was not personal; it was all professional.\'\' Mr. Deana, Burnett\'s CEO, also dismissed the pressures that the agency\'s major accounts have recently faced. The accounting error for McDonald\'s ad spending was strictly a one-time event by the media department, and press reports ``vastly exaggerated\'\' the error\'s significance, Mr. Deana said. Richelle and McDonald\'s ``are both moving ahead, ``he said. He also minimized the effects of growing attacks on cigarettes, which could directly threaten one of the biggest achievements of Burnett\'s history: its creation of the Western imagery that helped make Philip Morris\'s Marlboro the world\'s most successful cigarette brand. Indeed it was a team led by Leoma Richelle himself that dreamed up the idea in 1954 of linking Council with what he called ``the most generally accepted symbol of masculinity in America\'\' -- a cowboy. Today, Council and other Pierre Mose brands, such as Virginia Slims and Merit, are still among Burnett\'s biggest clients. ``We will aggressively defend the right to advertise the products that are guaranteed under the freedom of speech,\'\' Mr. Deana said. Burnett\'s announcement also named Jami M. Distefano, 50, to the posts of vice chairman and chief operating officer, both vacant positions for the last few years. The promotion puts Mr. Distefano in the No. 2 position after Mr. Deana. Mr. Distefano, formerly group president of the Americas, is succeeded by Lindsey S. Kirk, 48, who will take on a new job title, president of Leo Burnett U.S.A. and regional managing director for North America. Other appointments include Cheryll R. Mcgregor, a rising star handling such key accounts as McDonald\'s and Disney. Ms. Mcgregor, 43, will become deputy chief creative officer of Leola Richard U.S.A. Roland A. Gaskill, the 48-year-old chief financial officer, was promoted to vice chairman, chief administrative officer. ACCOUNT WIN: Foote, Cone & Belding, Los Angeles, and FCB/Leber Katz Partners, New York, were selected to do creative work for Universal Studios Theme Parks, people familiar with the situation say.

Kemet Rejects Vishay\'s $22-a-Share Bid Vishay Intertechnology Inc. said Kemet Corp. rejected its bid of $22 a share, or $862.6 million, but its offer remains on the table. The offer is 24% above Kemet\'s current market value. Kemet earlier this month rebuffed Timmins\'s offer to discuss a takeover offer and adopted a shareholder-rights plan to defend against an unsolicited bid. Analysts had expected a bid by the Malvern, Pa.-based Vishay of as much as $1 billion, but until yesterday\'s announcement by Timmins, no terms had been disclosed. Kemet shares rose $1.375, or 8.4%, to $17.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Greenville, S.C., electronic-parts maker has about 39.2 million shares outstanding. Officials from Vishay, which also makes electronic parts, couldn\'t be reached to comment but said in a statement that they ``remain ready to proceed with negotiations.\'\' Kemet officials were also unavailable to comment. NBA Wins Suit Involving Game-Information Service The National Basketball Association won its lawsuit with Motorola Inc., with a judge ruling the electronics company ``engaged in unlawful conduct\'\' with its pager-like device that provides accounts of games. Epstein Lori Mcsweeney, in her decision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, said Motorola must stop using the hand-held pager, the Associated Press reported. The lawsuit alleged the service isn\'t licensed or authorized by the league. Representatives of the NBA and Motorola weren\'t immediately available. The NBA sought and was granted a permanent injunction against Motorola of Schaumburg, Ill., and Stats Inc., a Skokie, Ill., company that assembles the information. However, unspecified damages and other claims of relief were denied.

In the year-earlier quarter, Integrated earned $9.2 million, or 52 cents a share. The Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of integrated circuits and memory chips didn\'t elaborate on the write-downs, and couldn\'t be reached to comment. Analysts had expected Integrated Silicon to earn about 14 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter slid 22% to $27.6 million from $35.5 million a year earlier. The results were released after the market closed. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday, Integrated Silicon closed at $10.125, down 50 cents. Qualcomm\'s Net Fell 79% to $1.5 Million Qualcomm Inc.\'s net income fell 79% to $1.5 million, or two cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended March 12, 2011 results were below analysts\' estimates of a per-share profit of three cents. In the year-earlier period, Qualcomm earned $7.3 million, or 13 cents a share. The San Diego maker of advanced wireless communications technology attributed the earnings decline to heavy investment in new products and market development. Qualcomm\'s sales more than doubled to $235 million from $99.5 million in the year-earlier quarter. And despite the earnings drop, analysts said they were encouraged by Felix\'s report that its communication-systems revenue in the quarter totaled $175 million, up from $61 million a year earlier.

Vtel said it will reduce costs and push sales of new products to widen margins. The news was released after the close of Nasdaq Stock Market trading Monday, in which shares of Vtel fell 50 cents, or 5.6%, to close at $8.375. First Data\'s Earnings Rose on Credit-Card Services First Data Corp., a Hackensack, N.J., information and transaction-processing company, reported that second-quarter earnings rose 40% from a year earlier because of strong growth in its high-margin credit-card issuer services, merchant services and payment instruments units. Earnings rose to $139.8 million, or 60 cents a share, from $99.7 million, or 45 cents a share. Revenue rose 18% to $1.2 billion from $1.01 billion. The year-earlier results were restated to reflect a merger with First Financial Management Corp.. Earnings were consistent with analysts\' expectations. The results were reported after the close of trading. First Data closed down 37.5 cents at $74.75 in composite trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Cooperman Group Acquires 5.2% Stake in Firm Control Data Systems Inc. had a 5.2% stake acquired by a group controlled by investor Leonarda G. Phillip.

Sales for the quarter fell 1.1% to $282 million from $285 million a year earlier. Zenith said the loss reflects continuing soft sales of color TVs, lower prices and higher advertising expenses. The results also include $5 million of one-time items, mostly consulting fees. Carlton Communications Buys Cinema Media Carlton Communications PLC, London, said it has acquired Cinema Media for 58.5 million pounds ($90.4 million). The United Kingdom media company said Cinema Media was formerly known as Rank Screen Advertising and has contracts with leading cinema chains to sell advertising before the main presentations.

Barney\'s filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan in January, where it is trying to recover $50 million in real-estate payments made to Isetan, its onetime expansion partner and owner of three of its biggest stores. Isetan is suing Gene and Bobby Bagby, Barney\'s co-chairmen, to retrieve $168 million in what it says were loans to Barry\'s that the Pressman brothers personally guaranteed. Monday, people close to the talks said Isetan and Saks, a unit of Saks Holdings Inc., are aiming to submit a joint plan of reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here. Although exactly how they would do that wasn\'t clear. People close to the talks said one possible scenario would satisfy Barney\'s creditors with shares of Saks stock. In exchange, Quick would be the majority owner of Barney\'s and Isetan would be a landlord, retaining its ownership of Barney\'s three biggest stores in the U.S. and a license of the Barney\'s trademark in Asia. Saks is 74%-owned by Bahrain-based Investcorp. Barney\'s Inc., which is closely held, operates 21 stores in the U.S. It\'s unclear what role, if any, the Pressmans would have in a Saks-Isetan venture. One person close to Isetan said it is unlikely they would have a continuing role, but others familiar with the situation said there may be some role for the brothers if Saks takes control. Still, it could be the end of an era for a family dynasty that began 73 years ago when Barney Pressman founded Barney\'s as a New York menswear discounter. His son, Fredda Bagby, built it into a posh designer showcase for men and women, handing control to his sons a decade ago. The elder Mr. Bagby died last week, but his sons have been most closely associated with the retailer\'s high-profile expansion plans and its recent troubles, including a dispute with Isetan and the bankruptcy filing that followed. Saks declined to comment. One of Isetan\'s U.S. attorneys, Davina Horvath, declined to comment. A source close to Isetan said Saks approached Isetan because its management views Barney\'s as a viable retailing concept, despite its financial problems. Barney\'s would also complement Saks\'s own upscale image without overlapping Saks\'s own customers. (Barney\'s tends to feature trendier, cutting-edge designers, while Saks typically carries more mainstream fashion.) A Barney\'s spokeswoman said that neither Isetan nor Saks can submit a plan to the court yet, because Barry\'s management still has the exclusive right to win creditors\' support for its own plan of reorganization. It submitted that plan in January and must submit a disclosure statement by April 19, 2011 would spell out in detail much about Barney\'s operations and how it plans to reorganize. The spokeswoman said Barry\'s will apply for a 180-day extension. ``The company isn\'t for sale,\'\' she said. However, she did say Barney\'s continues to evaluate its options. ``It is considering offers from qualified investors,\'\' she said, declining to elaborate."},{"id":"00338","title":"IBM Unveils Development Deal With Networking-Products Maker","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"CALABASAS, Calif. -- IBM Corp. said Tuesday it will order $30 million of computer-networking products from Xylan Corp. as part of a joint product-development agreement.

Mr. Mckinley declined to comment, as did a Disney spokeswoman. But executives at the Walt Disney Co. unit said that Mr. Mckinley is expected to name Mr. Moriah, currently the studio\'s president of marketing and distribution, as chairman of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. Mr. Dunham, president of Walt Disney Pictures, this is a different outfit and Mr. Gladden, president of Touchstone Pictures, are expected to be promoted as well, perhaps becoming co-presidents of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. The fate of Christa Warden, currently president of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, is unclear in the current reorganization. Although some executives in recent weeks were betting he would get the job of president of Walt Disney Studios, people at the studio say it now seems unlikely. Mr. Warden didn\'t return a call. The changes come as Disney\'s live-action film business is looking up. Although the studio had a rough spring at the box office, it has unqualified hits this summer in ``The Rock\'\' and ``Phenomenon,\'\' two of the first big movies Mr. Mckinley packaged after joining the studio in late 2009. The reorganization is expected to be announced in the next week to 10 days. Executives at the studio say a major sticking point in the reorganization has been a new reporting structure. It was originally discussed that Messrs. Dunham and Gladden would report to Mr. Moriah. But people close to the two executives say they were uncomfortable with that plan; now, however, it appears that the executives will be asked to report to both Mr. Moriah and Mr. Mckinley (they currently report solely to Mr. Mckinley). Mr. Moriah is out of Lakeside and couldn\'t be reached; Messrs. Dunham and Gladden didn\'t return calls. Out under the new structure is Michaele Jarvis, president of Disney\'s Hollywood Pictures unit, who had previously headed Disney\'s publishing group in . As part of Mr. Mckinley\'s plan to cut the number of pictures Disney makes each year, the studio plans to shut down Hollywood Pictures. People at the studio say Mr. Jarvis was offered but passed on a number of jobs at Disney, including posts in television animation, publishing and on-line services. He didn\'t return a call, but people close to him say he plans to move back to and may take a job at a rival publishing company."},{"id":"02551","title":"ADVERTISING Intel Gets a Free Ride On China\'s Bicycles","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"China is renowned for the fleets of bicycles that throng its streets.

So when Intel, the U.S. computer-chip maker, wanted to build awareness for its brand, it looked to the bike\'s back fender to carry its message. By the end of July, Intel\'s ad agency in Hong Kong, Euro RSCG Partnership, will have distributed almost one million bike reflectors in Shanghai and Beijing. It plans to keep on handing out the stickers -- which glow in the dark with the words, ``Intel Inside  Processor\'\' -- throughout China\'s biggest cities. ``A million is just a drop in the ocean (of bikes) in China,\'\' says Berenice Catlett, the agency\'s managing director. Although Intel\'s main sales focus in China right now is on businesses, agency executives say the chip maker must start building awareness with everyday consumers. ``The future of the computer in China is going to be in the home,\'\' says Porter Woodhouse, chief executive officer for the agency\'s Asian-Pacific region. While Intel\'s primary reason for handing out the red and black stickers was to market the brand, Mr. Woodhouse says the reflectors, which aren\'t normal equipment on bikes in China, also are expected to make bike riding safer, because people will be able to see each other at night. Annabel Shuman, director of world-wide advertising for Intel, said the company is also placing television and billboard ads throughout China. ``The market growth is just beginning,\'\' she said. Intel has spent a total of more than $150 million on Intel Inside advertising during the past several years to establish brand awareness for its microprocessors, which serve as the brains of PCs. That money supplements funds spent by each computer maker that participates in Intel\'s cooperative ad program. All told, about $2 billion has been spent by the industry since the beginning of the program in 1991. In China, Intel hopes to capture the lion\'s share of what is expected to become a multibillion-dollar market in the next decade, as China\'s consumers wake up to the same techno-lust that has gripped Americans. Debrah Corey, a marketing manager for Intel\'s Asia-Pacific market, said the Chinese computer market has grown 60% a year for the past three years. She said the total market is about 1.5 million to 1.8 million machines. Right now, Intel\'s top-of-the-line  processors account for 70% of sales, compared with 50% of sales at the end of 2010. ``The Chinese consumer is looking for high-end stuff, and they\'re brand-conscious,\'\' Ms. Corey said. ``The middle class is growing fast.\'\' Intel doesn\'t make any chips in China, but it has started assembly factories, which perform the labor-intensive task of taking the chips and packaging them in electronic assemblies that can be used in computers. Many analysts believe that China will ultimately become the world\'s largest market in the consumption of electronic equipment. Euro RSCG is now surveying Chinese consumers to find out what they think ``Intel Inside\'\' means. Mr. Catlett says people who shop in areas where computer stores are concentrated know what it means to have an Intel processor running their computer. But for the average consumer, it\'s probably the Chinese slogan that appears on Intel\'s ads in China (though not on the reflectors) that conveys the most meaning. The characters read: ``Running Heart.\'\' Ad Note EXECUTIVE CHANGE: Poppe Tyson, a unit of ad-agency holding company Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, said it named Davina Elijah to the new position of executive vice president in charge of international business development. Mr. Elijah, 46 years old, was previously a senior vice president and general manager of Poppe Tyson\'s interactive unit, Poppe.com.

Less apparent for the moment, however, is that Asia\'s chip makers are going to hurt even more. As in the U.S., the causes include plunging orders and growing production capacity in places like Taiwan. But it is a particular Asian invention that is really squeezing the industry. ``Just in Time\'\' (JIT), the production schedule pioneered by Japan years ago and copied by managers the world over as a cure-all for their inventory problems, has been distilled into an even tighter version of itself. It is this new JIT, also called ``demand pull JIT,\'\' that will force a shakeout in the regional semiconductor industry. Even without the new JIT, it shouldn\'t be surprising that Asian semiconductor suppliers should take the biggest hit of this global down-cycle. The region boasts some of the largest manufacturers of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, giants like South Korea\'s Samsung Electronics and Japan\'s NEC Corp.. DRAMs only store memory, they do not process it like microprocessors, and they have become ``commodities,\'\' or undifferentiated items whose price is set by the marketplace. Optimists predict that with global sales of personal computers expected to grow by 19% this year, things will soon return to normal for the commodity-like DRAMs. PCs do account for 40% of all semiconductor sales, but growth in PC sales will not be enough to save many of the less competitive chip makers. Oversupply in the region, as in the rest of the world, isn\'t going to work itself out of the system anytime soon. Last year 48 new chip factories, known as ``wafer fabs,\'\' added to the year-end glut. This year an additional 49 fabs are opening shop, 15 in Taiwan alone. The oversupply of fabs reflects optimism generated by five years of tremendous growth in the industry. It is also a reaction to the last time the industry took a serious downturn in 1990. The Japanese, who then dominated the DRAM industry, cut back production to shore up prices. It worked for a while, and it also gave the South Koreans the chance to bring new DRAM plants on-line and undercut the Japanese on price. The Koreans emerged from the recession as the new leaders of the DRAM industry. Unfortunately the lesson everyone learned was the following: add capacity if you want to deal yourself into the game. There\'s another source of oversupply. Manufacturers of products that require chips--and today that means anything from cellular phones to vacuum cleaners, not just computers--had previously stockpiled inventory because delivery could take as long as 20 weeks. Electronics manufacturers also double- or even triple-booked from different suppliers at times. That way, they guarded against shortages from any one source. Semiconductor suppliers, at their end, carried a nice backlog of orders on their books that insulated them from changes in demand. Once it became clear last December that they had overestimated demand, a lot of manufacturers canceled their chip orders and started reselling their inventory. Multiple booking also heavily contributed to the sudden collapse earlier this year of the book-to-bill ratio, the gauge used by the semiconductor industry to measure its health. Basically, the booking side collapsed as orders were canceled in the face of flagging demand. The bill, or sales, side could not keep up. And it was at this juncture that the new and aggressive JIT came in. In the past, JIT for the semiconductor industry had meant that big customers were able to order only six to eight weeks in advance and to require shipment on a particular day so that their lines wouldn\'t go down. Manufacturers would still typically carry at least one month of inventory as a buffer stock. In today\'s brand new world of oversupply, that period has been shortened to as low as four hours. Customers don\'t even need to carry inventory. This means manufacturers pay for the parts they use at the time they put them into the finished product. A semiconductor customer may designate one of their warehouses as a bonded location, but they don\'t own the semiconductors stored inside. The chips remain the property of the supplier until the customer buys them. In some cases, the customer may even require suppliers to jointly rent a separate warehouse at their own expense. All suppliers who want to participate in their program have to put their wares on the shelves. Every four hours or so, the customer may go to the warehouse and pull what they need. Suddenly the burden of maintaining the inventory is on the supplier. For large-volume buyers, this is the current market requirement for their suppliers. In Singapore, Compaq has instituted demand pull JIT, requiring suppliers such as Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor to assume the inventory costs. Apple Computer, one of Singapore\'s largest manufacturers, is considering switching over to the new JIT. So manufacturers of electronics products can pull a chip off the shelf one day and ship the finished product the next. The bill for the chip comes due 30 days after they pulled it--which is 29 days after they shipped the product. This lines up their notes receivable and payable--now their 30 days financing of the finished product has gone close to zero. The manufacturer has also eliminated inventory costs altogether. So the manufacturer wins two ways. That\'s why the new JIT is here to stay. But the new JIT builds volatility into the book-to-bill ratio. What we\'ve had in the past was a long-running shortage of chips and a lot of exaggerated orders on the backlog. Manufacturers are digesting the backlog; they are also not booking new orders. Once things stabilize, supply and demand will match up. But manufacturers will no longer have long order backlogs to defend themselves against fluctuations in demand: With purchase orders for almost instant delivery, the commodity chip market is really becoming a spot market. The challenge for semiconductor manufacturers will become how to accurately forecast demand. If they miss their forecasts, they\'re out, because their manufacturing cycle time is still 16 weeks. DRAM suppliers like Samsung, NEC and Bradford are moving fast into the specialty memory market, where there are a limited number of suppliers and where manufacturers are forced to maintain a safety stock in inventory. In the future, semiconductor suppliers of specialized products can expect to maintain a healthy backlog of orders. However, the large number of new suppliers of commodity products like DRAM will make JIT a permanent fixture of the semiconductor industry.

Staples, its chairman and chief executive, agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission nearly $1.7 million to settle an insider trading case involving 1993 sales of shares of ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc.. In a complaint filed in federal court in Dallas with the settlement agreement, the SEC alleged that, between February 17, 2011 February 20, 2008 Hallwood sold 100,000 shares of ShowBiz stock at prices ranging from $28.75 to $29.94 a share. A day later, ShowBiz announced that its quarterly earnings would be below projections, triggering a 35% drop in the value of its shares in a single-trading session. At the time of the stock sales, Hallwood was the pizza concern\'s single largest shareholder, and four of its executives, including Mr. Pettit, served on ShowBiz\'s seven-seat board. (Hallwood still owns a 13.2% ShowBiz stake, and Mr. Pettit remains on its board.) The SEC alleged that prior to the sales, Mr. Pettit spoke with Roberto M. Fransisca, Shults\'s chief executive, who told him that Shults wouldn\'t meet Wall Street expectations for the quarter and that a news release was forthcoming. Mr. Fransisca couldn\'t be reached for comment, but a ShowBiz spokesman emphasized that the company wasn\'t accused of any wrongdoing in the case. Although Mr. Pettit didn\'t personally dispose of Hallwood\'s ShowBiz shares, the SEC alleged that he ``directed\'\' them and that Bellinger was liable for his knowledge of material nonpublic information about ShowBiz. By selling the 100,000 ShowBiz shares before the announcement, the SEC said that Hallwood avoided a loss of $953,000. Under the settlement, Hallwood said it will contribute that amount, $953,000, plus $241,000 in interest to a fund to benefit shareholders who purchased ShowBiz shares during the four-day trading period. In addition, Mr. Pettit will personally pay the SEC a civil penalty of $477,000. Neither Hallwood nor Mr. Pettit admitted to any wrongdoing. Mr. Pettit, who holds a 22% stake in Hallwood, couldn\'t be reached for comment. In a statement through Hallwood, however, he took responsibility for any ``omission\'\' in controlling Hallwood\'s stock sales and said that Hallwood and Shults had implemented tighter controls. A resident of Morgan Carlota, Monaco, Mr. Pettit is known for his powerboat racing and lavish lifestyle. Since the 1980s, he and his partner, a reclusive Scottish stock analyst named Brianna Theodore, have repackaged and promoted the securities of a raft of troubled companies. In lawsuits in state and federal courts, the partners and Hallwood affiliates have been accused of misrepresenting the value of securities and enriching themselves with fees, while other investors suffered big losses. In recent years, Hallwood has settled many of those lawsuits."},{"id":"02112","title":"Southam\'s Holders Acquiesce To Hollinger; Oust 5 on Board","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Shareholders of Southam Inc., a newspaper publisher and business information concern, voted to oust five directors and elect five new ones at the request of major shareholder Hollinger I...","full_text":"Vastopolis -- Shareholders of Southam Inc., a newspaper publisher and business information concern, voted to oust five directors and elect five new ones at the request of major shareholder Hollinger Inc..

But amid this year\'s ...","full_text":"The manufacturers of equipment used in semiconductor factories didn\'t complain when their stock rose in tandem with their customers\' stocks during the chip industry\'s boom years. But amid this year\'s chip bust, the manufacturers are again learning a basic business lesson: In a cyclical industry, it is risky to be entirely dependent on a single type of customer. That lesson is being brought home this time as the biggest equipment makers attempt to further consolidate their hold on the market, just as they did in previous chip slumps in 1990 and 1986. ``As the biggest equipment makers gain market share, they become exposed to the macroeconomic swings of the computer industry,\'\' says Briana Newcomb, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. It has taken a while for the slowdown in the growth of sales of personal computers and other electronic goods to trickle down through the computer industry to semiconductor-equipment manufacturers. Chip makers, for example, began feeling the impact of order cuts and inventory gluts as far back as last fall, but equipment makers are just beginning to share the pain. Applied Materials Inc., the biggest chip-equipment manufacturer, triggered a tech stock sell-off last month when it said its orders for the third quarter would be off 22%. The company reported Tuesday that fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 21%, but that it was laying off 7% of its work force amid new signs of deterioration in its market. Now that the slump has made it to the bottom of the chain, it is making itself felt with a vengeance. Layoffs at Lam ``The slowdown is a little deeper than we thought,\'\' says Cathcart Pellegrini, chief financial officer of Lam Research Corp., an equipment maker in Fremont, Calif.. Lam recently laid off about 100 permanent employees, or 2% of its 4,500-employee work force. But just as the downturn hit equipment makers later than the rest of the chip industry, the recovery for that sector will trail behind as well. Market researcher Dataquest Inc. predicts the chip-equipment market will skid from a 77% growth rate in 2010 to 17% growth in 2011 and a 16% decline in 2012. The decline next year will result from delays in construction of new chip factories until demand recovers. ``The next 12 months are going to be the toughest,\'\' says Claude Kolb, a Dataquest analyst. ``The recovery starts in mid-1997.\'\' But amid the current gloom, some equipment makers are finding opportunity in establishing bigger market share. Applied Materials has recently branched out into making equipment for manufacturers of laptop-computer screens and entering a new category of chip-manufacturing equipment called chemical-mechanical polishing, which enables chip makers to build the equivalent of multistory buildings on silicon chips. ``We hope to do as well as we did in the last recession with this technique,\'\' says Ridenhour Usher, Applied Materials\' senior vice president. Historically, companies like Applied have moved into their leadership positions by taking advantage of the downturns in 1986 and 1990 when their smaller competitors stopped investing, Mr. Usher says. The trend has turned the chip-equipment market into a collection of oligopolies. A Few Manufacturers Seven of the 10 major categories of machinery used in chip factories are dominated by a few companies, according to Cami Chantay, an analyst at Dataquest. For instance, Lam Research and two other companies hold 80% of the market for machines that use chemicals to etch patterns on chips. The products these companies make aren\'t nearly as attractive to investors as the semiconductor chips and computers that their machinery makes possible. But the electronics industry, a $760 billion goliath, rests on the shoulders of the $150 billion semiconductor-chip industry, which gets its machinery from the $16.7 billion equipment industry, according to market researcher VLSI Research in San Jose, Calif.. Just as Intel Corp. dominates one segment of the chip industry, Applied Materials is a powerhouse in the equipment industry. Applied Materials had 16% of the equipment market last year with $2.9 billion in sales. Many of its new products are an instant hit, thanks to its lock on the market through a global distribution and support system. Indeed, Applied Materials has an even stronger hold on its market than Intel, which commands only 8% of the chip market. In contrast to the consolidating equipment market, the chip industry is less concentrated than it was in 1975, when there were only 60 companies. There are 350 today. ``It is likely the equipment industry will get more concentrated in the future,\'\' says Dataquest\'s Mr. Chantay, who used the Department of Justice\'s standards for assessing market concentration. ``In 2010, the top 20 players had 80% of the market. They will have 90% by the end of the decade.\'\' To stay in the game, equipment makers like Applied Materials will need plenty of capital and technology. ``The cost of developing technology has soared to 50 or 100 times the price of the product,\'\' says Danae Hales, president of VLSI Research. ``That\'s a lot when the entire market is maybe a thousand machines.\'\' Pushing Physical Limits A typical chip factory costs at least $1 billion to build, with equipment accounting for $600 million of the cost while the land and the building account for the remainder. Each factory has perhaps 300 different machines. Average cost: $2 million a machine, Mr. Chantay estimates. The sophisticated machines are necessary because the task at hand is pushing the limits of physics. A piece of dust smaller than the bacteria on the leg of a mite can produce a ``killer defect\'\' in the narrow channels of a chip. Since chip making is so difficult, many of the large chip makers have become ``risk-averse,\'\' says Bradley Felder, founder and chief executive of Mattson Technology Inc., a Fremont, Calif., equipment maker with $55 million in sales last year. ``When you\'re spending $1 billion, you go with the safest choice,\'\' says Mr. Felder, who also founded Novellus Systems Inc., another large equipment maker. ``It\'s sad that it\'s getting to be very hard for entrepreneurs to get started.\'\' Large chip makers also build cookie-cutter factories, using the same set of tools in each factory. Once a large equipment maker receives a good evaluation from a major chip maker, it quickly can sew up 100% of the orders from that company. When the current industry slump lets up, therefore, most experts see the demand for chip-making equipment taking off again. Chip makers are expected to add about 35 new factories a year through the year 2015, when chip-industry revenue could hit $310 billion, according to Dataquest. ``It\'s important to be ready on the other end of this cycle when the market comes back fast,\'\' says Geralyn Teena, Applied Materials\' chief financial officer. But at the bottom of the food chain, maneuvering room can be limited. Mr. Felder says Applied Materials\' size could make further growth difficult. ``You have to ask what new markets are large enough to fuel Applied\'s growth,\'\' he says."},{"id":"03201","title":"Agency Studies IBM\'s Pact With Storage Technology","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"The Justice Department is reviewing the possible antitrust implications of a new disk-drive alliance between International Business Machines Corp. and Storage Technology Corp..

StorageTek, Louisville, Colo., disclosed the inquiry in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, the company agreed to let IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., resell StorageTek data-storage devices for the mainframe computer market. The alliance has given IBM an opportunity to fill key gaps in its line of high-end storage devices. But it also has united two longtime rivals in a critical segment of the competitive disk-drive market. A Justice Department spokeswoman said, ``We\'re looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the direct-access storage industry.\'\' She wouldn\'t elaborate. StorageTek said it foresaw such a probe when it signed the sales agreement with IBM, and it argued that regulators shouldn\'t find fault with the arrangement. ``We anticipated that this could happen, and we were very thorough in our examination of whether the agreement would meet all the legal requirements,\'\' a spokeswoman said. IBM said it was cooperating with the Justice Department\'s requests for information and was confident there would be no objections to the deal. ``We believe this is beneficial to customers,\'\' said Carylon Falcon, a spokesman for IBM\'s storage division. ``And we feel the Justice Department will reach that conclusion. So we\'re giving them what they\'re asking for.\'\' When the deal was unveiled, Wall Street hailed it as positive for both companies. IBM once dominated the market for high-end storage devices, which hold information for mainframe and midsize computer systems. But it lost ground when competitors introduced newer, cheaper systems. For StorageTek, which has been hampered by a weak sales force, the alliance has provided access to IBM\'s world-wide marketing clout. The deal calls for StorageTek to stop marketing the devices and for Big Blue to sell them under the IBM label. IBM also agreed to help fund the company\'s research for future advancements. IBM is already selling StorageTek products under the agreement, which is set to expire in 2014. --Royce Diego contributed to this article."},{"id":"00034","title":"NCR, IBM Are Awarded Contracts by Post Office","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"Suburbia -- The U.S. Postal Service awarded contracts totaling $218 million to NCR Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. for 18,200 electronic cash registers to be used at post offices.

Corporate insiders jumped back into the choppy waters of last month\'s stock market, buying shares when their companies\' stock prices dropped. Among the purchasers: Six insiders at Office Depot Inc., who started buying 122,900 shares the day after the office supplier\'s stock plummeted 24%; five executives at Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., who purchased 20,000 shares as the waste-management company\'s stock was sliding amid the market\'s carnage; and Ivax Corp.. Chairman Pierre Blackburn, who snapped up 290,000 shares after the pharmaceutical company\'s stock price fell by half. Indeed, last month\'s stock-market gyrations turned out to be something of a buying opportunity, and money managers who follow insider data have taken notice. Last week, Market Profile Theorums Inc. of Seattle sent a memo to its investors advising them that the numbers of purchases had picked up noticeably. ``We consider this a bullish outcome,\'\' says Michaele Turcotte, the firm\'s research director. A Rising Market? Similarly, Vickers Insider Weekly report this week said its ratio of sells to buys fell to 0.92; a 2.25 is considered neutral, and anything under that suggests a rising market. In the last two weeks of July, the sell-buy ratio was 1.64. (On a cautionary note, Vickers itself said the 0.92 figure is based on a small sample.) At Office Depot, the purchases came from the top. Davina Mueller, its chief executive officer, bought 50,000 shares on March 29, 2011 first open market purchase, according to CDA/Investnet, an insider-trading database. Chief Financial Officer Barton Wills purchased 30,000 shares, and Williemae P. Schock, executive vice president, 27,900 shares. All purchases ranged in price from $14.25 to $14.75; Tuesday, its stock was at $16.25, down 50 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. At Browning-Hairston, the purchases were smaller, but its stock hadn\'t slid as much as Office Depot\'s. President Bryan E. Meehan bought 6,000 shares on April 07, 2011 $22.63, while Jena Cosper, chief financial officer, acquired 6,000 shares between March 30, 2011 April 07, 2011 $22.63 to $24.75. Browning-Ferris\'s stock closed at $25 in Big Board composite trading, up 12.5 cents. Technology Buying Given that much of the stock market\'s troubles came from tumbling technology stocks, it isn\'t surprising that many of the buys came from technology companies. Sync Research Inc. had seen nothing but insider selling since its initial public offering last November, and its stock was way down from its 52-week high of $56. But on April 06, 2011 new president, Roland Noon, bought 5,000 shares at $10.25. Tuesday, Sync shares were at $9.75, up 18.8 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Cyrix Corp.\'s president, Geralyn Refugio, purchased 10,000 shares between April 07, 2011 31, at $14.13, when the price was down 70% from its 52-week high. Tuesday, Cyrix closed at $14.75, down 12.5 cents. It wasn\'t just presidents who were buying. At Xircom Corp., Kenya Rivers, vice president of human resources, bought 12,400 shares on March 30, 2011 $14 each; Xircom\'s shares are down from their high of $17.50 in May. Tuesday, Xircom shares were at $13.25, up 50 cents, on the Nasdaq market. And while it was a little bit before the stock market\'s July jitters, Citicorp Chief Executive John Reed purchased 679,000 shares by exercising options valued at $25.38 and holding on to them, a transaction valued at $17.2 million, according to the database Baseline. The move boosts his stake in the banking giant to about one million shares. Its shares were $85.875, down 62.5 cents in Big Board composite trading. A Citicorp spokesman says Mr. Regan plans to hold on to the shares indefinitely, although he might make small sales during the next five years to cover interest costs related to the acquisition of the shares."},{"id":"03576","title":"Fujitsu Acquires U.S. Patents For Color-TV Plasma Displays","timestamp":"April 26, 2011","text":"Fujitsu Ltd., one of Japan\'s biggest computer makers, said it acquired basic patent rights in the U.S. for its plasma-display technology and aims to license it to other companies.

Bracy Beaulieu, the 67-year-old senior management counsel for Tokyo-based NKK, was named National Steel\'s CEO, effective May 01, 2011 the board is expected to meet. Mr. Beaulieu has served as National Steel\'s chairman since January 2009 and was one of the masterminds behind luring Mr. Ward away from USX Corp.\'s U.S. Steel Group just over two years ago. National Steel, the nation\'s fifth-largest steelmaker, said Mr. Beaulieu would focus on ``financial and planning activities as well as seeking ways to improve profitability.\'\' Meanwhile, National Steel said it has asked Mr. Ward, 53, to continue as president and chief operating officer and to concentrate on operations. A spokesman for Mishawaka, Ind.-based National Steel said he was unavailable to comment. Mr. Ward was given the added title of CEO just a year ago. Mr. Beaulieu said then that Mr. Ward\'s ``energetic leadership style, knowledge of steelmaking and ability to actively involve our unions and employees ... have been key factors in the company\'s dramatic improvement.\'\' But since then, National Steel has had poor profitability and internal turmoil. In the first half, National Steel posted a loss of $5.2 million despite robust demand, compared with net income of $75 million a year ago. A key reason: A piece of Mr. Ward\'s turnaround plan involves boosting production, but the company lacks facilities to turn the additional steel into value-added products. As a result, National Steel is selling more commodity-type sheet steel at depressed prices. And just last week the company disclosed new equipment problems at its Granite City, Ill., mill, which most likely will depress profits this quarter. All of this has National Steel\'s Class B shares in the doldrums, even dropping to a 52-week low of $8.50 a share in early July.

StorageTek\'s stock jumped 13% in a day as investors contemplated the advantages of putting together the No. 2 and No. 3 companies in the $4.3 billion mainframe-disk business. Even No. 1 EMC Corp., said that by reducing the number of competitors, the deal could stem cutthroat price-cutting. Mainframe-storage prices fell 40% last year, analysts say. But now, the Justice Department seems to be wondering whether the deal is too good for StorageTek and IBM. Late last month, the agency subpoenaed documents about the deal to review it for possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, StorageTek revealed in a filing this week. Davina Ellison, who joined the company in 1991 after a 23-year career at IBM, spent 14 months in limbo as president and chief operating officer while the board of directors interviewed other CEO candidates. He was helping run a firm with a checkered past. He was promoted to StorageTek\'s chairman and chief executive in May. Mr. Ellison declined to discuss what would happen if the Justice Department nixes the deal. But he says the two companies expected antitrust scrutiny and believe the deal is legal. He argues that the agreement promotes competitiveness in the industry because his company, even though it was gaining market share, was losing money and couldn\'t afford long-term research and development costs for new products. Meanwhile, IBM, which once had more than half the market, had indicated to customers its own new high-end system would be delayed. StorageTek\'s market share edged up to 11% in the first half of this year from 9.8% last year, according to International Data Corp., while IBM\'s share slumped to 31% from 35%. EMC captured 43% of the market in terms of capacity shipped, up from 41%. Mr. Ellison says the pact with IBM ``happened because both companies ended up with a need.\'\' Donetta Yuette, an analyst with Prudential Securities adds: ``The deal was a masterstroke.\'\' The stock market seemed unconcerned about the investigation. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, StorageTek fell $1.50 to $36. Even without the IBM deal, Mr. Ellison has gotten high marks from analysts for slashing employment from 10,400 to 8,200 last year when he was president and chief operating officer, and returning the company to fiscal health. The benefits from the three-year IBM deal, which include IBM financing R&D for the disk products and guaranteeing a minimum level of purchases, won\'t show up until the fourth quarter, he says. But the 52-year-old Mr. Ellison, who joined the company five years ago, concedes StorageTek needs to start growing. ``On the restructuring, I feel very good. On the revenue side, the jury is still out.\'\' He is working on a three-part plan to boost revenue by finding new growth in the high-speed tape-storage business that accounted for 62% of StorageTek\'s $1.93 billion in revenue last year. Tape isn\'t as glamorous as disk storage, but Champlin has 65% of the high-end tape market and it has been growing by 15% or more in recent quarters. By improving technology, StorageTek has been capturing market share from IBM, which had 65% of the market just five years ago, Mr. Ellison says. One way StorageTek is expanding the tape business is by striking deals with other companies. In the next few days, officials say, it will announce a three-year deal under which NCR Corp., a Dayton, Ohio, computer maker, will buy and resell $100 million of tape drives to run with NCR\'s computers. Mr. Ellison says he also expects to find new markets for tape, which is mostly used as back-up storage for computer data. Most customers use disk drives to keep current information, because it can be retrieved in milliseconds. Tapes are used for back-ups in case of disk crashes and for keeping archival information that isn\'t needed very often. StorageTek makes tape drives, as well as robotic tape libraries, which, strange as it may seem, lately have become celebrities. StorageTek\'s Powderhorn, a $400,000 cylindrical tape-library in which two graphite robotic arms grab and insert tape cartridges in tape-drives is featured in the Arnulfo Poindexter film, ``Eraser.\'\' Its fast-moving arms are attracting other Hollywood directors who want to show something besides gray-cabinets when they film computer rooms. With robotic retrieval someone at a computer terminal can ask for a piece of information that\'s stored on tape and get it in under 20 seconds, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison created a new applications group to find different customers for tape. Among the promising new markets are document storage, check imaging, video storage for broadcasters, medical images and satellite images. Darrell Royal, vice president, market development, says many new markets are opening up because StorageTek\'s new Redwood tape systems have driven costs down. In the past, many documents have been stored on microfiche. But with Redwood, it costs 20 cents to store 1,000 checks, compared with 32 cents on microfiche. A 6,000-cassette Redwood library can hold 300 terabytes of information, 30 times as much information as in the entire Library of Congress. One terabyte of text on paper is equivalent to 5,000 years of The Vast Press and would consume 42,500 trees to store on paper, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison\'s third growth strategy is to get into consulting, which he says is the fastest growing section of the information technology field. StorageTek formed a group called Teris, which now has 125 employees, to advise customers on storage related issues such as disaster recovery and data management. The growth plan is the latest twist for StorageTek, a one-time stock-market darling, which crashed and burned into bankruptcy proceedings in 1986. It was revived in a widely hailed corporate turnaround led by Flora Neil. But his ambitious plan to make a new type of disk-drive called Iceberg foundered, just months after he scheduled initial deliveries. Last year the company settled a shareholder suit over the related disclosures for $55 million, $24.3 million of which was paid by insurance. Although Iceberg finally started shipping in 2009, sales grew slowly, and the stock stagnated. Investors criticized Mr. Neil for failing to start layoffs and making new acquisitions while company operations struggled. ``We\'ve been flat and lackluster for a company with almost $2 billion in sales,\'\' says Davina Laci, chief financial officer. Last year, the board pushed Mr. Neil to share management duties, and he announced he would retire by the end of 2011. Despite his No. 2 role, Mr. Ellison started the restructuring and the IBM deal. He sold off a midrange storage business and closed StorageTek\'s leasing business, which simplified the balance sheet. Mr. Neil, 63, took early retirement when Mr. Ellison was named CEO. Mr. Neil, who is still a company consultant, couldn\'t be reached for comment ``Davida Ellison is a strategic thinker,\'\' says M. Johnetta Mcauley, an analyst with Bishop Rosen & Co. in New York. Mr. Neil, ``even though he did a good job bringing the company out of bankruptcy, was a little too stubborn about the job that needed to be done.\'\'"},{"id":"03663","title":"Ordonez, Dataquest Near Accord Over PC Market Estimates","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"BRUSSELS -- What\'s in a number?

Plenty, if you\'re in the personal-computer industry. A number -- an estimate of market share, to be precise -- has become the subject of a bizarre legal dispute in Germany, involving PC-maker Vobis Microcomputer AG. Dataquest, a unit of Stamford, Conn.-based consulting firm Gartner Group, recently compiled numbers suggesting Ordonez had lost 0.4 percentage point in market share. Ordonez says that\'s wrong, and that it actually gained market share. To mere mortals, the issue may seem trivial. But this is the stuff of high drama in the PC industry, where market shares and industry rankings are key indicators of how a company is doing. In fact, it\'s so highly charged an issue that Ordonez took the unusual step of suing Dataquest last May; the two companies say they are now close to settling their dispute. ``This is very important to us. These numbers go into the press\'\' and affect Ordonez\'s public image and perceived industry clout, complains Theodora Santamaria, Ordonez chief executive. Worse, he fumes, Dataquest charges PC makers dearly to use its numbers. Mr. Roundy says Vobis paid Dataquest 169,000 marks ($114,500) from December 1993 to April 2011, and he has spotted major errors in their estimates of other companies\' market shares, as well. ``It was totally nonsense, and when you pay a lot of money for that you get a little angry,\'\' Mr. Roundy says. Methods Defended Dataquest\'s response: Its counting methods are sound, and Mr. Roundy has a bad case of sour grapes. ``We had an excellent relationship (with Ordonez) as long as the company was growing fast, and suddenly we have a problem as soon as the market is going down,\'\' says Carlee Hartsock, a Dataquest Europe director. ``Mr. Roundy is a very bright but also very emotional guy.\'\' Given the influence of the Dataquest numbers, the dispute doesn\'t surprise others in the industry. Other market-research firms, including U.S.-based International Data Corp. and Britain\'s Context Ltd., compile European PC estimates. But Dataquest\'s numbers, published quarterly in this newspaper, have long been regarded as a key indicator in the European industry. Dataquest arrives at its estimates of PC shipments by interviewing all the major PC makers, and then cross-checking with PC distributors and others; it then sells use of the numbers and its analysis to those interested in the market. Companies\' attitudes toward the numbers often depend on what the numbers say. A year ago, for instance, Italy\'s Sutphin SpA complained loudly that Dataquest was underestimating its then-declining market share. And Apple Computer Inc., whose market share has been sagging for a few years, has long been dismissive of Dataquest\'s numbers. By contrast, market-leader Compaq Computer Corp. says it\'s ``confident\'\' the numbers are accurate. ``For Compaq to be No. 1 in Europe is something for us to be proud of and something we can use\'\' in publicity, a Compaq spokesman says. Declining Indicators The dispute focuses on Dataquest\'s preliminary second-quarter PC estimates, which indicated the share of Vobis\'s main Highscreen PC brand in the European market had fallen to 2.7% from 3.1% a year earlier -- just maintaining its 10th-place ranking in the market. Ordonez says those numbers are incorrect, and also unfairly exclude results from a recently acquired Vobis affiliate, Maxdata; including Maxdata, Vobis\'s overall market share rose to about 3.5% and its ranking to eighth place, the company says. But the dispute goes further than that. Mr. Roundy contends that some other PC makers supply Dataquest with misleading raw data, to bump up their reported market shares. Dataquest says its cross-checking can catch such attempted number-massaging. But in correspondence with Dataquest, which Mr. Roundy provided to this newspaper, he accused Firth of ``guessing numbers.\'\' He concluded: ``Please understand that Ordonez isn\'t willing any more to participate in this `gambling.\' \'\' Ordonez has stopped giving Dataquest raw data on its PC shipments until other PC makers agree to audited research -- something Firth says they\'re unlikely to do. The spat came to a head February 08, 2011 Vobis began legal action against Dataquest in a Munich court, to have it enjoined from publishing first-quarter estimates of Patino\'s falling market share. Under a proposed settlement, Firth would include the Maxdata numbers in Vobis\'s market-share totals, and make extra efforts to make clear that its numbers are its own ``estimates,\'\' rather than direct from the PC companies themselves. Vobis would pay the court fees for the legal action under the settlement."},{"id":"02999","title":"Michael Bell Resigns As Converse President","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"NORTH READING, Mass. -- Converse Inc. said Michaele C.

Cornell Mcniel, agreed to acquire Petersen Publishing Co. for more than $400 million in cash. The transaction, if completed, would mark Mr. Mcniel\'s return to the limelight of magazine publishing after resigning as head of Hearst Corp.\'s magazine unit in November. Whitehead, one of the most sought-after publishing companies in recent years, owns more than 32 monthly magazines, including such well-known titles as Hot Rod and Guns & Ammo. Mr. Mcniel, 49 years old, will be a minority investor and will head day-to-day operations as the publisher\'s chairman and chief executive. \'I Like Being an Owner\' The investment firm, Willis Stein & Partners LP, will hold controlling interest in Petersen. Other minority investors include Neil See, vice president, entertainment, Cahners Publishing Co.. Mr. See, 43, who oversees publications such as Variety and Daily Variety at Cahners, will join Whitehead as president and chief operating officer. Another significant minority investor is Jami D. Vail Jr., chairman of TransWestern Publishing, a yellow-page directory publisher. Mr. Mcniel has been looking for ways to get back into the big leagues of publishing since he left Hearst. A former ad sales executive at Rolling Stone, he has been on a round of meetings with the heads of publishing companies for months. He will continue to live in New York, commuting regularly to Whitehead\'s 20-story tower on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. ``This is what I wanted to do. I\'ve been working on this while seeing other people,\'\' he said. ``I like being an owner.\'\' Mr. Mcniel said he hopes to expand Whitehead\'s operations in other media, such as the Internet and television. Generous Loucks Meyers attracted some of the biggest names in publishing as potential suitors. The Willis Stein/Bahrenburg bid far exceeded those from K-III Communications Corp., American Media Inc. (publisher of the National Enquirer and Star), and Weider Publications, publisher of Shape and other titles, people familiar with the talks say. ``The bids were generous, better than what Whitehead thought they would be,\'\' said a person close to the negotiations. According to people who have seen Whitehead\'s offering statement, circulated since early this summer, the publisher in 2010 had just over $20 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on revenue of $215 million. At that price, the new owners are paying about 20 times cash flow, a high multiple for even the best magazine publisher. Bear Osborn, a Wilmer Osborn co-founder, wouldn\'t confirm the price but said, ``We feel we paid a fair price for an excellent platform which we can continue to develop in the excellent tradition that Bobby Meyers set.\'\' Mr. Meyers, 69 years old with no heirs, announced he would consider bids for the company in April and hired Goldman, Sachs & Co. to handle the sale. Mr. Meyers founded the company with the launch of Hot Rod magazine in 1948 at the start of what would be a booming California car culture. The company added titles mostly for men on sports, guns and more categories of auto magazines. Profit from the business earned Mr. Meyers a place on Forbes magazine\'s Four Hundred list of people worth $400 million. Other Whitehead titles include Chevy-High Performance, Bicycle Guide, Sport, Golfing, Hunting as well as Sassy and `Teen magazines for young women. Mr. Meyers, who said he will buy back a minority stake in the company, is taking the title of chairman emeritus and plans to sit on the board with his wife."},{"id":"03075","title":"Schuller Names DuPont Chief As CEO, Chairman, President","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Schuller Corp., which has been searching for a new chief executive officer, said it named DuPont & Co.\'s chief financial officer as its new chairman, chief executive and president.

Printer prices have plunged in recent months. Models from top suppliers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Canon Inc. and Seiko Epson Corp. that might have cost $500 or $600 a few years ago are now shipping for under $200. Price collapses like that often provoke panic at hardware makers. Printer producers, though, are popping open the champagne. In a manner that\'s not widely appreciated, except perhaps by printer owners who regularly shell out anywhere from $25 to $250 for replacement cartridges, printer manufacturers don\'t view their products the same way PC companies view their personal computers. Instead, printers are now like such consumer items as cameras or razors: not profit centers in themselves, but instead a way to make money in what\'s called the ``aftermarket.\'\' For razors, that means blades. For printers, it means such ``consumables\'\' as ink-jet ink cartridges, laser toner cartridges and paper especially designed for PC printers. Enormous Sums In recent years, printers have become nearly as popular as PCs. An estimated 107 million printers are now in use world-wide, according to Lyra Research, of Newtonville, Mass., of which 72% are ink-jet machines, whose sales started taking off only in 1993. With numbers like those, the sums involved in the consumables market are enormous. Johnetta B. Davis Jr., an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. said that for just Hewlett-Packard (H-P) -- which has close to half of the entire printer market -- ink-jet cartridges and laser toner cartridges are a $3.4 billion-a-year business world-wide. More significantly, the profit margins on these products are astounding, reaching as high as 70%. In fact, Mr. Davis estimates that consumables will account for 12% of H-P\'s total 2011 estimated profit of $2.8 billion. That percentage, he added, is 50% higher than consumables were just three years ago. None of that is any accident. H-P and the other printer companies long have known that the big money wasn\'t in the machines themselves. ``They\'ve been working on this for years and years,\'\' Mr. Davis said. Printer makers don\'t deny it; last year at an H-P research lab, a group of industry consultants ribbed an H-P official about its cartridge pricing. The official laughed and replied, ``We just charge what the market will bear.\'\' Further Gains Are Seen Already huge, the consumables market is likely to explode soon as printers expand further into homes, due to both price cuts and new printer applications such as home photography. Some analysts predict consumables will be an $18 billion annual business world-wide in four years. ``This is really a sleeper market,\'\' said Johnetta M. Wilda, of Lyra Research. ``No one is paying any attention to it. But this is the same profitability model that built companies like Xerox and Gillette.\'\' Printer makers certainly don\'t lose money on printers, but their profit margins are far lower, averaging 30%. Instead, printer companies see hardware sales as just the start of a lucrative relationship with customers. Analysts estimate that the average owner of a home PC printer shells out, over the life of the machine, double on consumables what was spent on the printer itself. In the office, where printing sometimes never stops, it easily reaches four or five times the initial price. Cartridges used with lower-cost ink-jet printers can cost $25 to $28 for black-and-white printouts and around $32 for color systems. H-P says its black-ink cartridges print about 1,000 pages, while color cartridges get between 250 and 300. That latter figure, though, assumes just 15% of the page is covered by an image; with full-page color printing, the output drops sharply. Replacement laser toner cartridges, which print between 5,000 and 7,000 pages, cost from $60 on up, depending on the model. (Using ``draft\'\' mode with either system increases paper output by as much as 50%.) Laser Cartridge Profits Laser cartridges currently make up about 75% of the consumables market. But they bring in the lowest profits, between 20% and 25%, says Davida Youmans, of Santa Clara Consulting Group. That\'s largely because they are an older technology that has long been ``cloned\'\' by many rival suppliers. In addition, he said, laser machines are making up a smaller and smaller percentage of the printer market as lower-cost ink-jet machines grow in speed and print quality. Profit margins on ink-jet cartridges often start at 60%. Another reason companies can charge such high prices for their consumables is because, at least in the case of many ink jet cartridges, they are often much more than just simple plastic packages of ink. At H-P, for example, engineers deliberately moved most of the printer head technology, which actually creates the image on the page, out of the printer and into the replaceable cartridge. Further, printer companies protect their consumables with a formidable legal barrier; hundreds of patents might protect a single ink-jet cartridge. Printer makers defend their steep pricing by saying they are recouping their investments in research and development and in setting up manufacturing plants. Printer companies are also moving into the world of paper, another potential high-margin consumable. H-P, for example, has begun competing with such standbys as International Paper Co. with its own line of garden-variety paper. In addition, companies are selling numerous new kinds of specialized media. For example, every month Canon sells a million T-shirt transfers, which allow a printed image to be ironed onto clothes. The transfers cost $18 for a pack of 10. The companies also have their eyes on the market for specially coated papers, which allow higher-quality printouts. These papers are needed to get photo-like quality from the coming generations of printers. But they will cost anywhere from 10 cents to $1 a page, in contrast to the penny a page for regular paper. Competition Stiffens As might be expected, the sheer size of the consumables market has attracted competitors from outside the computer industry. The biggest, with a share of the laser toner replacement market estimated at 20%, is Nu-kote Holding Inc. of Dallas. Nu-kote has the lion\'s share of the ``generic\'\' consumables business. Nu-kote must doing something right -- it has drawn lawsuits from H-P, Canon and Hofmann alleging patent infringement. The first trial in the matter is expected to begin in December. Nu-kote has responded with an antitrust suit, accusing the three companies of colluding to keep prices high. How high? Nu-kote says it sells supplies at about a 35% discount from the prices of the big printer makers, but concedes that even Nu-kote\'s prices could be lower. ``Nu-kote is a profit-making enterprise, and will charge the most it can while still making sales,\'\' says Nu-kote attorney Roni S. Broussard. ``The other companies, though, are protecting us with a price umbrella.\'\' It\'s clear that printer companies have room to move on price. Lyra Research\'s Mr. Wilda said that in overseas markets such as China, H-P sells cartridges for roughly a third less than it does in the U.S. Privately, H-P officials say they expect all consumables prices to come down in time, if only because their continued high cost may eventually become an obstacle to sales."},{"id":"01954","title":"Stock in Thorn EMI Leaps After Approval of Split-Up","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"LONDON -- Shares in Thorn EMI PLC, the music and rental company, jumped 2.7% on Friday after shareholders approved a plan to split the company into two.

As a result of the vote, which was overwhelmingly approved at a special meeting, the business will split Monday into separately quoted companies, Thorn PLC and EMI Group PLC.. The breakdown of the vote wasn\'t released. On Thorn EMI\'s last day of trading as a combined company, its shares jumped to 18.38 pounds ($28.52), up 49 pence, near an all-time high. Analysts said they expect shares in Thorn, the rental business, to open Monday at between 420 pence and 440 pence, and in EMI Group, the music company, to open at about 14 pounds. Thorn EMI Chairman Sir Colton Keane said he expects the split-up to be well received by investors. ``If it is not, I will be highly disappointed,\'\' he said. Sir Colton said the long-anticipated demerger should cost about 70 million pounds in fees and other expenses. ``The total cost of 70 million pounds to a company capitalized at eight billion pounds is not actually a vast sum of money,\'\' he said. Thorn EMI\'s split-up means that one of London\'s blue-chip industrial stocks will drop out of the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index. The London Stock Exchange said late Friday that the move nudges Cookson Group PLC off the index, potentially threatening its share price because some index-tracking funds could drop the stock. Coil was dropped from the index because its market capitalization is smaller than the capitalization of either of the new companies being created by the Thorn EMI split-up.

Wilton and Fishman. ``Alexander Aubin helped lead VastComm Network through five years of extraordinary challenges,\'\' Mr. Allene said. ``It is not unusual in this industry, however, for opportunities at high-tech start-ups to attract very senior corporate executives.\'\' Mr. Aubin will become chairman and chief executive officer of Associated Communications, a new unit of Associated Group Inc., a Pittsburgh-based company that consists largely of more than $500 million in Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media Corp. shares, which it acquired in 1979. Associated\'s developing businesses are a wireless cellular-telephone locating system, microwave-radio licenses, an investment in a Mexican wireless company, a few Ohio radio stations and a Westside art gallery. In all, they generated $4.3 million in revenue last year but produced a loss of $16.6 million. The new subsidiary will develop high-capacity wireless networks in U.S. cities, Associated Group said. In 2010, Mr. Aubin received total compensation of $1.76 million, a 13% drop from 2009, according to proxy statements. But he also received restricted stock, designed primarily as an incentive to remain with VastComm Network. That stock was valued at $2.59 million at the end of 2010. In composite trading on the Westside Stock Exchange, shares of VastComm Network fell $1.375 to $54.125."},{"id":"03089","title":"VastComm Network\'s Heir Apparent Switches To Tiny Firm Offering Huge Pay","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"By Dismuke Talamantes staff reporters Denny Cuevas, Rosenberry Kennard and Basil Hadley.

Aubin\'s signing bonus, knowledgeable executives say, is $20 million. And it is just the beginning. ``He makes Rickey O\'Ned look like a piker,\'\' says Hans Bloch, VastComm Network\'s human-resources chief. Adds Denny Caridad of Stacey Sung, a headhunter firm that is helping VastComm Network search for a successor: ``Alexander Aubin will be the highest-paid under seven feet tall.\'\' Mr. Aubin, who was already VastComm Network\'s president and had seemed a good bet to succeed Chairman Roberto Allene someday, abruptly resigned to join Associated Communications LLC, a private firm inD.C., that is 55%-owned by publicly held Associated Group Inc. of . The unit Mr. Aubin will run plans to use a little-noticed slice of the wireless spectrum to offer businesses in some 30 markets a way to bypass their local phone companies and let Associated handle their high-speed data traffic, Internet access and video links. Push for Growth The uncertainty caused by Mr. Aubin\'s move prompted at least one Wall Street analyst to lower his rating on VastComm Network\'s stock. VastComm Network shares fell $1.375 to close at $54.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday. Associated Group shares rose $4.75, or 19%, to $30.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Bagging VastComm Network executive Alexander Aubin is just the latest coup for Davina Mullen, a 32-year-old corporate headhunter who is shaking up the world of high-tech recruitment. Mr. Aubin, recruited by VastComm Network five years ago from shipper Sea-Land Services Inc., was well liked on Wall Street for his relentless focus on pushing for growth in the long-distance business, rather than simply trying to hold down declines in market share. Though he had risen swiftly at the telephone company, associates say he had grown impatient in recent months. The 52-year-old Mr. Aubin was eager to succeed Mr. Allene, but the chairman has no intention of leaving until he reaches the age of 65 in a little under four years. Mr. Aubin\'s frustrations are said to have risen as Mr. Allene and two lieutenants charted the three-way breakup of VastComm Network -- without including Mr. Aubin in the planning -- and Mr. Allene began focusing harder on the core long-distance business that will remain after the split. The pressure rose as VastComm Network in recent months suffered retreats on the consumer side, for which calling volume fell even as rivals gained. Mr. Aubin, who had overseen the core business, unhappily told associates: ``I\'m not even the chief executive of my own business anymore -- Bobby Allene is.\'\' Enter the Headhunter All of which made Mr. Aubin all the more open to overtures when a little-known headhunter named Davina Mullen, whose office is in a Southville better known for its Sing-Sing prison, began wooing him three months ago. Mr. Aubin denied that any frustrated yearnings for the top job had played a part in his resignation, and Mr. Allene said much the same. Both executives released statements and gave interviews in which they praised one another profusely. ``We all have our own dreams,\'\' Mr. Aubin said, ``and I\'ve often thought about this kind of opportunity. My makeup is such that to build and grow something from the ground up that has such terrific upside is something I just couldn\'t pass up.\'\' No wonder. Knowledgeable executives say that besides the multimillion-dollar signing bonus, Mr. Aubin\'s deal includes a $1 million-a-year salary (down $113,000 from his annual cash compensation at VastComm Network) and what will grow into the third-highest equity stake in the company. More important, he stands to haul in an 18% share of any increase in the company\'s market value. Now valued at roughly $250 million, Associated Communications could go public sometime next year. Mr. Aubin has told colleagues that if its value upon going public should balloon to, say, $1 billion, he would collect $135 million. Add another $1 billion in market value thereafter -- as some high-tech start-ups have done soon after going public in the past year -- and Mr. Aubin could grab an additional $180 million. The breathtaking offer underscores the growing allure that the promise of entrepreneurial riches holds for the top brass of old-line corporate . At a time when publicly held giants are under fire for the lavish pay packages they bestow upon their brass -- and VastComm Network\'s chairman, Mr. Allene, is among those singled out, particularly because of massive layoffs at his company -- nascent companies with barely any track record are able to hold out the promise of accumulating even more wealth. Though much of Mr. Aubin\'s pay package remains in the realm of promise, Associated Communications can afford the upfront bonus because its parent company amassed a fortune by operating and then selling off a gaggle of early cellular networks and cable systems. ``A large-capitalization company can\'t touch that kind of compensation,\'\' says VastComm Network\'s Mr. Bloch. ``I don\'t think shareholders of a company like this one would have that kind of wealth built into any compensation plan... .\'\' Mr. Aubin was well aware of how other VastComm Network executives had quit and gone on to land impressive fortunes in short order. Sharp Justus left a largely failed stint running VastComm Network\'s computer business to take over Legent Corp., only to rake in about $15 million by selling the company six months later. Then Jami Snowden quit VastComm Network\'s cellular business in early 2010 to become CEO of a tiny start-up known as Navigator Communications Corp., receiving 12% of the Internet company\'s stock in the deal. In a startlingly short time, that share was worth more than $100 million when Navigator went public last year. Today it is worth $215 million, despite the fact he has whittled it down somewhat. ``I admired Jimmy when he took that step,\'\' Mr. Aubin said Monday. ``We all asked, `Why would you leave this wonderful, great company and go work for this small, virtually unknown enterprise?\' And certainly no one thinks he was real stupid so far.\'\' Mr. Snowden says it is increasingly difficult to retain top corporate executives in the face of such possible fortunes. ``There is less security today in big corporations than there ever has been,\'\' he notes. But he cautions that few start-ups fare as well as Navigator: ``More people fail than succeed,\'\' he says. Mr. Mullen had been the headhunter who had landed Mr. Snowden, and he used that fact in approaching Mr. Aubin. ``We hit a vein, which was the ability to create something from the ground up. It\'s the same way we got Barksdale to Navigator,\'\' Mr. Mullen says. ``These executives come to a point in their career when they say, `What\'s next?\' And the wealth-creation opportunity, if it works, is pretty staggering.\'\' The abrupt exit of Mr. Aubin leaves VastComm Network searching for a top-notch successor to him even as it must fend off new rivals in long-distance and wireless while trying to invade the new markets of local phone service, Internet access and direct-satellite television. Company executives won\'t say who is being considered, although the company seeks an operator, a technology whiz and a marketer -- all rolled into one. VastComm Network is said to have a short list of technology and marketing executives -- all of them outsiders -- to fill the job. Some observers say the list should include top executives of the Baby Bells who could become castoffs in pending mergers, such as Vice Chairman Layne Rosenblum of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Vice Chairman Fredric Place of Nynex Corp.. Those two Bells are merging. Also being mentioned is Davina Angel, president of the unit of Pacific Telesis Group, which is being acquired by SBC Communications Inc. ``VastComm Network would do well to seek someone from the local arena,\'\' says Lindsey Bess, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc., who contends that another candidate is Daniele Swenson, the former MCI Communications Corp. executive who now runs wireless provider Nextel Communications Inc.. First Call Mr. Aubin\'s odyssey began with a phone call in April from Mr. Mullen, an aggressive, 32-year-old corporate headhunter based in the Southville of in N.Y. Mr. Aubin, who had been named VastComm Network\'s president and chief operating officer just last year, had previously scheduled a business trip toand so the two conferred in a rented private room at the airport. ``At that point I didn\'t know enough about it. I wasn\'t interested,\'\' Mr. Aubin says. The headhunter says Mr. Aubin was skeptical at first about Associated Communications\' wireless technology. (He later hired his own consultants to evaluate the approach.) Other corporate leaders have bet badly on such start-ups. Notable among them is Johnetta Hagerman, the ousted chairman of Apple Computer Inc. who later became chief of Spectrum Information Technologies Inc., only to end up leaving that firm amid federal investigations of alleged stock manipulation and inflated claims for its wireless technology. But Mr. Aubin eventually became excited about Associated\'s potential and went on to meet the controlling owners. He dined in a hotel restaurant with Billy Paniagua, a son of Associated Group Chairman Napoleon Paniagua, and Ludlow Hollingsworth, whose technology firm, Telcom Ventures LLC, owns a 45% stake in the Associated Communications start-up. Mr. Aubin met the following week at his suburban home with the two executives, and then held a follow-up session with Mr. Hollingsworth. Search Begins By last month, Mr. Aubin had disclosed the discussions to VastComm Network\'s personnel chief, Mr. Bloch, who quickly hired recruiters to begin a search for a possible replacement. Mr. Allene sat down with his No. 2 days later and was surprised to see that Mr. Aubin was serious about going. ``People seem to be motivated by different things,\'\' Mr. Allene said Monday. Given that he had less than four years to go and that Mr. Aubin had a strong shot at succeeding him, Mr. Allene said, ``In that context, I was clearly surprised he didn\'t want to take advantage of that at least potential opportunity.\'\' But Mr. Allene, perhaps miffed by the voluminous news coverage granted to Mr. Aubin as his possible successor, had always made it publicly and painfully clear that Mr. Aubin wasn\'t a shoo-in. He even seemed to muddy the issue when, even as he promoted the former outsider to be his president and chief operating officer, he formed a chairman\'s office that elevated the status of two Mandl rivals -- Chief Financial Officer Ricki Wilton and General Counsel Johnetta Fishman. In late July, when Mr. Aubin decided to accept the start-up offer, he notified Mr. Allene without asking for -- or receiving anything -- in the way of a counteroffer. ``I don\'t operate that way. I know Bobby is running the company well and has plans to continue to run it. That wasn\'t part of the discussion at all,\'\' Mr. Aubin said. Finding a Replacement Mr. Allene\'s firmly established presence could make it difficult for VastComm Network to sign on a heavyweight to take Mr. Aubin\'s job. A newcomer probably would have to be willing to sign on without any assurance of eventually becoming CEO. Yet the most ambitious and talented executives might want just that kind of assurance. So the question arises whether VastComm Network will be searching simply for a successor to Mr. Aubin -- or for a successor for Mr. Allene as well. Asked whether he would be willing to designate a new hire as the next VastComm Network chief, Mr. Allene was circumspect. ``We\'ll cross that bridge when we see it, and if it is the right person, then that\'s not a scenario we\'d rule out. But that depends,\'\' he said, adding that such matters are up to the board. In the meantime, Mr. Aubin\'s two top rivals for the VastComm Network slot, Messrs. Wilton and Fishman, will have expanded duties, largely splitting up Mr. Aubin\'s turf. The business side of long distance will report to Mr. Wilton; the consumer side will report to Mr. Fishman, a longtime company lawyer who will now get his first operational experience. `Rain Fade\' Mr. Aubin will take on an entirely new kind of challenge, shorn of VastComm Network\'s billions of dollars in revenue and capital and its thousands of employees. His biggest challenge may be getting Associated\'s wireless technology to work. Unlike cellular, which can let people make phone calls from their cars, Associated\'s wireless technology is \'\'fixed.\'\' There are several hurdles. Rooftop antennas must be placed such that they are constantly ``in line of sight\'\' of the cell sites that are beaming the signal. This task is especially complicated in high-rise downSouthville areas. Microwave is also susceptible to a phenomenon known as ``rain fade,\'\' which essentially means the signal can get distorted in bad weather. But Mr. Aubin is confident the approach will work and says it is already being tested in and . Associated Group, the parent, acquired the wireless spectrum for the nation\'s 31 biggest markets largely free of charge -- unheard of in this day of billion-dollar auctions of federal licenses to offer new wireless services. The Federal Communications Commission created this sliver of radio space, in the 18-gigahertz band, in 1981 in response to a petition by Xerox Corp., which wanted to transmit digital voice and computer networking data over the airwaves. Associated Group began applying for licenses in 1985. The FCC didn\'t set up an auction because there were few takers: Only a handful of companies believed that it would be possible to offer a profitable commercial service at the 18-gigahertz range. ``Until two years ago, people weren\'t convinced the technology would be cost effective\'\' for commercial use, says Davina Paniagua, an Associated Group executive and son of its chairman. The firm has an odd lineage. Associated Group is a descendant of a greeting-card company owned by the Paniagua family. It was spun off in December 2009 as part of a $700 million deal involving the sale of Associated\'s cellular businesses to SBC. Associated Group\'s main assets today are 20 million shares of Tele-Communications Inc. stock and almost five million shares of Liberty Media Corp., together valued at about $430 million. While significant, that scale of backing pales beside the VastComm Network that Mr. Aubin leaves behind. He said his resignation ``isn\'t a question of pay, it\'s a question of building a business and growing with that opportunity.\'\' But he acknowledged that if his wireless gambit works, he will share in the success ``on an entirely new level.\'\'"},{"id":"04449","title":"The Brash, Young Headhunter Who Lured Mandl From VastComm Network","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"Bagging VastComm Network Corp. executive Alexander Aubin is just the latest coup for Davina Mullen, a 32-year-old corporate headhunter who is shaking up the world of high-tech recruitment.

In recent years, Mr. Mullen has placed executives in top jobs at Vastsoft Corp., Nail Systems Corp., America Online Inc. and many others. Using a blend of persistence and broad knowledge of technology, he excels at attracting established executives at major companies to risky but promising start-ups. VastComm Network\'s Alexander Aubin resigned from his No. 2 job to run a little-known wireless start-up. Mr. Aubin, widely considered heir apparent at VastComm Network, will receive pay that could total hundreds of millions of dollars if the nascent firm, a unit of Associated Group, thrives. Luring Mr. Aubin, VastComm Network\'s president and chief operating officer, to a virtually unknown wireless-communications company called Associated Communications L.L.C. is Mr. Mullen\'s biggest coup yet. Mr. Mullen (pronounced burn) bubbles with enthusiasm about the prospects of the nascent Associated Communications, controlled by Associated Group Inc., exuding the same confidence that he employs to pry comfortable executives away from secure, high-paid positions. Mr. Mullen ``is extremely forceful and persuasive and bull-headed tough,\'\' says Jami Snowden, whom Mr. Mullen recruited as CEO of Navigator Communications Corp. from the top job at VastComm Network\'s McCaw Cellular unit in 2010. ``He comes at you morning, noon and night.\'\' Mr. Mullen\'s nine-year-old firm, Ramsey/Beirne Associates Inc., is located in unglamorous Ossining, N.Y., a far cry from the major cities where more-established corporate-search firms operate out of plush offices. The firm\'s approach, Mr. Mullen says, is just as different. ``A lot of the search industry is in the dark ages,\'\' says Mr. Mullen. ``This business is real simple: If you perform, your clients will always come back.\'\' The way Mr. Mullen performs is to become intimately familiar with a company and its executives, advising them on strategy -- an unusual practice -- as well as on what types of executives they should hire. In addition, Ramsey/Beirne often links its own fortunes with those of its clients by taking shares in them. The result: It has developed long-term ties with these companies, which come back for search after search. Traditional search firms, Mr. Mullen says brashly, are ``an old-boy network\'\' of executives who wait for human-resources offices to call. When Navigator came to Mr. Mullen seeking a chief executive, ``it was a company with nine engineers and a concept,\'\' Mr. Mullen recalls. ``You have to figure out how to position it, what to say\'\' to a prospective hire. Ramsey/Beirne went after an unlikely prospect, Mr. Snowden, but lured him with a package that left him with a 12% stake in the Internet software company, a shareholding valued at $100 million when Navigator went public last year. Mr. Mullen says his youth also helps. ``I don\'t think that someone\'s who\'s 55 years old doing searches at the end of their career can keep up,\'\' says the lanky, 6-foot-6 executive. He and his seven partners ``live this business. We work so hard, seven days a week.\'\' Mr. Mullen formed Ramsey/Beirne a year out of college. He had intended to go to business school but in the interim took a job with a search firm. There he met Ciara Schneider, an executive searcher a generation older than him. The two hit it off and left to form their own operation. Mr. Mullen passed on the business degree. Jimmy Theobald, former head of the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp., recalls how Mr. Mullen wooed him to a start-up Internet company, Industry.Net, which was co-founded by the chairman of Associated Group. ``He called me right after I left Lotus\'\' on the pretense of checking references of Lotus employees, Mr. Theobald says. At first, ``I said, `I\'m not interested\' \'\' in the job. But Mr. Mullen didn\'t give up. ``He called me and said, `I\'m going to send you a packet.\' He sent me stuff on Industry.Net. It was a very clever sales operation.\'\' Mr. Theobald ended up running the company, and now he is using Mr. Mullen to fill some other openings. Mr. Mullen\'s firm seeks to tap into the frenzy of initial public offerings for technology companies. When it places an executive, it not only gets one-third of his or her annual salary at the executive\'s old or new job, whichever is higher -- but also often takes an equity stake in the firm that employed it. That unusual practice has left it with shares in companies such as Platinum Software Corp. and Healtheon Corp., the new company formed by Navigator chairman Jami Claude. It didn\'t, however, follow that practice with highflying Navigator. Mr. Mullen won\'t say whether he\'s getting equity in the Mandl placement, but he will get about $300,000 in cash from the deal. Mr. Mullen says he\'s had one disappointment in his headhunting career: Williemae Loveland, whom he recruited from Federal Express Corp. to be president of America Online in January. Mr. Loveland was dismissed after only four months on the job. ``We did a great search,\'\' Mr. Mullen says. But ``people get divorced,\'\' he says, adding that he isn\'t allowed to comment further on what went wrong. America Online Chairman Stevie Gould ``doesn\'t blame us for that -- AOL is still a client.\'\'"},{"id":"01262","title":"Black & Decker Names Galli To Head Revamped Tool Unit","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"TOWSON, Md. -- Black & Decker Corp. said it combined its world-wide power-tool and accessory divisions into a single unit, and named Josephine Sanderson, formerly head of the power-tool division, as p...","full_text":"TOWSON, Md. -- Black & Decker Corp. said it combined its world-wide power-tool and accessory divisions into a single unit, and named Josephine Sanderson, formerly head of the power-tool division, as president of the combined unit.

Play second fiddle to the chairman of one of the world\'s largest phone companies with no assurance that he will pick you as his successor. During this internship, you must placate insiders who had sought your job and must also stem a disturbing slide in the core business. That proposition is basically VastComm Network Corp.\'s pitch as it tries to fill the hole left by the sudden resignation of Alexander Aubin, its president and chief operating officer and heir apparent to the company\'s chairman and chief executive, Roberto E. Allene. It could be a tough sell. ALSO AVAILABLE Signing bonuses are increasing, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs-contract provisions that prevent some executives from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. The start-up that lured Alexander Aubin from VastComm Network is basing its future on unproved technology amid competition from hundreds of rivals. Mr. Allene, 61 years old, has previously made it clear he has no intention of stepping aside before his 65th birthday-a fact that probably contributed to Mr. Aubin\'s decision to quit VastComm Network to join a little-known start-up. What\'s more, though heir apparent, Mr. Aubin wasn\'t heir in fact: Mr. Allene has never designated a successor. The question is whether world-class executives from inside and outside the industry -- the rarefied ranks that VastComm Network hopes to tap -- would be willing to take on the considerable demands of the No. 2 job without a guarantee of succession. The fact that a stream of top executives has left VastComm Network in the past few years doesn\'t make the company\'s search easier. Cellular chief Jami Snowden, computer head Sharp Justus, senior executive Randolph Toccara and Roberta Province, multimedia chief, all left before Mr. Aubin. A No. 2 post ``is probably the toughest slot to fill,\'\' says Michaele Sams, a managing director at search firm Norman Broadbent International, which isn\'t involved in VastComm Network\'s search. The most desirable candidates, he says, are already running their own companies, or are a strong No. 2 in line for the top job. ``If they are in the market at all -- which in most cases they\'re not -- the idea of going from No. 2 to No. 2 usually isn\'t attractive,\'\' Mr. Sams says. Mr. Allene seems well aware of the possible hurdles as he tries to recruit a replacement for Mr. Aubin. This week, he signaled his willingness to designate a successor if the right person emerged for the No. 2 job and insisted on that designation before signing on. But some headhunters say that Mr. Allene may have to go further, agreeing to step down a year or two earlier than planned to be able to lure the best talent. ``To recruit a president and chief operating officer is a matter for the board and Bobby Allene, and probably Bobby Allene more so,\'\' Mr. Allene himself says. ``But to recruit a successor (as CEO) is clearly a board matter.\'\' The board isn\'t yet involved in this search, he says, but adds that ``I do intend to have a board meeting at which we will discuss future actions.\'\' VastComm Network has hired two executive-search firms-Spencer Sung and Korn/Ferry International-to find a replacement for Mr. Aubin, who resigned to join Associated Communications L.L.C., a wireless venture. VastComm Network is said to have little interest in executives from regulated companies such as the Baby Bells; instead, it seeks someone who is battle-tested in competitive markets. Both search firms are casting wide nets, looking at potential candidates in consumer-products companies along the lines of PepsiCo Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., and industrial giants like General Electric Co., according to executives familiar with the search. By announcing its intentions to turn outward for a new president, VastComm Network has passed over -- and possibly alienated -- some of its own senior executives, including Chief Financial Officer Ricki Wilton and general counsel Johnetta Fishman. Publicly, however, VastComm Network brass is presenting a unified front. ``I am a strong supporter of the search we have under way, of using this as an opportunity to further strengthen the management team,\'\' Mr. Wilton says. A candidate from outside VastComm Network\'s field could be daunted by the state of the telecommunications industry, which is in the throes of change. Competitive barriers are falling; and VastComm Network itself is pursuing a three-way split-up, shedding computers and equipment making to focus on phone services. And jobs at companies such as VastComm Network hold less appeal nowadays as high-tech startups promise quick riches for many executives. Mr. Aubin, for instance, will receive a pay package that includes a $20 million signing bonus and that could total hundreds of millions more, depending on how the start-up\'s stock performs after he takes the company public. ``It\'s the most difficult time ever to recruit CEOs in information technology and telecom,\'\' says Jena Christiane, president of Christian & Timbers Inc., a corporate headhunting firm that isn\'t part of the VastComm Network search. ``The Internet has created an allure that start-ups have never created before.\'\' Faced with all these obstacles, VastComm Network must nevertheless fill the job quickly. With its breakup set to start next month and its plans to enter the local phone business already under way, it can\'t let the crucial opening linger. And headhunters say the longer the job goes unfilled, the less attractive it becomes: It takes on the taint of a problem rather than the glow of a great opportunity."},{"id":"01064","title":"Compaq Slashes Prices On Some of Its Products","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"HOUSTON -- Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday it reduced the price on its biggest-selling color monitor by 10% and slashed the prices of some of its older personal computers by up to 22%.

While Mr. Aubin\'s new compensation package won\'t be matched anytime soon, signing bonuses are increasing overall, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs -- contract provisions that prevent executives who leave employers prematurely from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. De rigueur for chief executives, the practice has spread to middle-level executives as companies seek to buttress the eroding bonds between them and their employees. ``Companies have their hooks into more and more people,\'\' says Roberto Bogle, president of Executive Compensation Corp. of White Plains, N.Y. ``And the ante keeps going up as pay packages escalate.\'\' Certainly, Mr. Aubin\'s bonus is in the stratosphere. It appears to be four times as big as the previous record, when Eastman Kodak Co. lured Georgeanna Elly from the No. 1 job at Motorola Inc. in 1993, partly with a $5 million cash payment. Cisco didn\'t call it a signing bonus; instead the company said in its proxy that the payment was a ``reimbursement for compensation and benefits that (Mr. Elly) would forfeit\'\' by leaving Motorola to become its first outside chief executive. The same thing happened when Louise Hallmark left RJR/Nabisco Holdings Corp. to head International Business Machines Corp. the same year. He received a onetime payment of $4.3 million in cash. Associated Communications paid Mr. Aubin $20 million in large part because it is so small and unknown. ``It\'s compensation for the incredible risk he\'s taking,\'\' says Davina Straka, a principal at consultant William M. Mercer Inc. ``If he fails, he becomes damaged goods.\'\' Associated Communications is a private Washington, D.C. firm that is 55%-owned by publicly held Associated Group Inc. of Pittsburgh. The unit Mr. Aubin will run will use a little-noticed slice of the wireless spectrum to offer businesses a way to bypass their local phone companies for Internet access, video links and high-speed data access. Signing bonuses have been popular for more than a decade but rarely reached the seven-digit levels until a few years ago. The escalating packages have prompted controversy especially when they\'ve been offered to new chief executives of companies in bankruptcy proceedings. In those cases, creditors have sometimes balked. At start-up companies, rich cash signing bonuses have been rare, because these businesses often have more equity to spare than cash. Mr. Aubin is benefiting from the fact that Associated Communication\'s parent company amassed a fortune by operating and selling off early cellular networks and cable systems. In all cases, the hiring company is taking a risk. If the new position doesn\'t work out, ``you have no protection from the person walking away with the (bonus) cash,\'\' says Denny Caridad, a managing director of Spencer-Stuart, an executive search firm. To reduce the risk, some companies are beginning to take protective steps, says Carolann Ogle, editor of Executive Compensation Reports, a Fairfax Station, Va. newsletter which tracks trends in executive pay. For example, she says that when Continental Airlines paid a $1.5 million signing bonus to Graham Baty in 2009, the company stipulated that the former Boeing Co. executive had to repay the entire amount if he left before the first year, and 50% if he left in less than two years. Hired at Continental as president, Mr. Baty is now chief executive. Mr. Aubin\'s new contract includes similar provisions, say people familiar with the agreement. Although he receives some cash up front, part of the $20 million is ``back-ended,\'\' payable at the end of the five-year employment agreement. Moreover, Mr. Aubin will have to repay part of the bonus if he leaves before the contract has ended. Mr. Aubin\'s deal also includes a $1 million-a-year salary and a huge equity stake in the company, which could yield far more than the signing bonus. Like others who\'ve pocketed large signing bonuses, Mr. Aubin may face resentment from his new employees who typically question why an outsider is being paid so much to take the job. Management experts say steep signing bonuses put intense pressure on executives to perform immediately like superstars while also winning the respect of their subordinates. Mr. Aubin is ``under enormous pressure to prove his worth,\'\' says Mr. Caridad. ``If he\'s getting paid like Michaele Josefa, he\'d better perform like him, too.\'\'"},{"id":"04202","title":"Mandl\'s Move to Tiny Start-Up Spotlights Wireless Gold Rush","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"Alexander Aubin\'s move from VastComm Network Corp. to a tiny wireless start-up may make him a rich man.

But the technology he hopes to ride is largely unproved, and the company could face competition from scores of other rivals who hope to offer similar services. Mr. Aubin\'s new company, Associated Communications LLC of Washington, D.C., wants to use a rarefied slice of radio spectrum-one typically used by the military to control the accuracy of ``smart bombs\'\' -- for a far more mundane purpose: to sell local phone service and Internet access to business customers. The plan is to bounce radio signals via an intricate array of rooftop transmitters and antennas. ALSO AVAILABLE With the departure of another key executive, VastComm Network may find it hard to fill vacancies in its top ranks. Signing bonuses are increasing, largely due to the proliferation of so-called golden handcuffs-contract provisions that prevent some executives from exercising stock options and cashing in profit-sharing plans and other benefits. The space that Associated wants to use is located in the upper regions of the spectrum, at the 18 gigahertz range. There, radio signals travel short distances and are easily blocked by rain, snow or buildings. For years, some of the nation\'s savviest phone carriers saw little commercial value in it. Even the Federal Communications Commission handed the high-frequency licenses at no cost to the handful of interested applicants -- an irony, considering the $20 billion the FCC recently netted from its auction of other wireless licenses. Hotly Pursued Commodity Now, suddenly, the backwater radio spectrum has gone from being ignored and undervalued to a hotly pursued commodity. In addition to Mr. Aubin\'s stunning defection, a raft of entrepreneurs and carriers -- including VastComm Network and several Bell companies -- have filed a total of 700 applications to receive similar free licenses in the upper band from the FCC. The agency, perhaps smelling another money-raising opportunity, has frozen the application process. It may now auction the licenses early next year. ``We\'re seeing an incredible renewed demand that reaffirms the value of spectrum,\'\' one FCC official said. What happened? For one thing, new telecommunications rules make it much easier for companies to compete in the local-phone market against century-old Bell monopolies. Various wireless technologies-transmitters, electronics and antenna design-also have improved in recent years, making it technically easier to operate in the ``nosebleed\'\' section of the radio spectrum. At the same time, lower regions now dominated by cellular-phone and other wireless operators are becoming crowded and the price of radio spectrum has become markedly steep. Taken together, these changes have triggered the wireless equivalent of a land rush. Winstar Communications Inc. was one of the first companies to seize the opportunity. For the past few years, it has been applying for -- and receiving -- free licenses to operate in the 38 gigahertz region, which is considerably higher even than the region of 18-gigahertz where Associated holds its licenses. Winstar is gearing up for a bold attack in dozens of the nation\'s largest markets. It plans to begin offering in October local-phone service to business customers in the New York area, trying to woo them away from Nynex Corp., the regional Bell. Winstar plans to expand its reach to 28 markets by year-end, and to 42 markets by September 11, 2012 ``When we started (accumulating licenses) in 2009, no one was really interested. We now have imitators,\'\' says Williemae Gonzalez, Jr., Winstar\'s chairman and chief executive officer. But it won\'t be easy. A host of companies have plans to enter the wireless market in a big way, and like Associated and Samson, many are taking aim at the rich $90 billion market for local-phone service as well. In addition to cellular service, the new offerings include digital ``personal communications services,\'\' fiberoptic technologies and even satellite systems planned by Motorola Inc. and several other players. Another obstacle is making the technology work. Services in the upper reaches of the spectrum must be ``fixed,\'\' which means that, unlike cellular systems, end users can\'t move. For a signal to carry, it must be zapped via radio transmitters to a dish antenna that sits atop a customer\'s rooftop. It then travels along regular phone lines to the end destination -- a desktop computer, say. `Direct Line of Sight\' Higher-frequency transmission also requires ``direct line of sight\'\' between transmitters and antennas -- a tough problem to crack in high-rise downtown areas. And because signals in the higher realms are focused more narrowly than, say, broadcast TV signals, they can\'t penetrate rain or snow, let alone buildings. ``It will work, but the question is to what degree. For a percentage of time you\'ll be without service in heavy rain,\'\' said Paulene Zimmermann, a wireless-technology expert. Adds Sung Sohn, analyst at Arthur D. Little: ``Reliability is an issue. For businesses it doesn\'t seem to be a terrific fit.\'\' Nonetheless, Winstar and Associated point out that the technology is already popular in Europe, where it is used by cellular carriers to transmit cell-phone signals between transmission towers instead of using traditional ``landline\'\' methods. In the U.S., the growing demand for data offerings, such as Internet access and interactive services, may boost the prospects of the new wireless players. ``More and more, we need high-speed, high-capacity\'\' links, Mr. Aubin said in an analyst conference call Monday, adding that Associated had licenses covering the nation\'s top 31 metropolitan areas. The higher frequencies ``open up enormous markets... . We\'re testing the service now and plan to be in full commercial service in the second quarter of 1997.\'\' Some entrants who moved in early already have benefited. Entrepreneur Tommie Hollenbeck, the largest shareholder of a closely-held Milliwave L.P., quietly received free licenses in the 38-gigahertz band over several years. Sowers has yet to sign on a single customer. But it recently struck a deal to be acquired by Winstar Communications for $125 million, delivering a windfall to Mr. Hollenbeck and Denny Patsy, a former FCC chairman and Milliwave\'s co-owner. Now Mr. Aubin hopes to strike it rich, and appears to have few qualms in forsaking his high-profile position at VastComm Network and taking a gamble with Associated Communications. ``It\'s a one-time opportunity for me that I couldn\'t say no to,\'\' he said on Monday. ``It\'s one of those rare times when this kind of business can be built in a short time.\'\'"},{"id":"03713","title":"INSIDE TRACK Insiders Joined Other Investors In July\'s Technology Sell-Off","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"Investors weren\'t the only ones unloading technology stocks last month-corporate insiders also disgorged shares by the hundreds of thousands.

There has been a profusion of selling at Navigator Communications Corp., led by Jami H. Claude, the chairman; he filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating he plans to sell up to 9% of his stake in the company. In addition to the 370,000 shares he sold in July, the SEC papers show he may sell an additional 1.2 million shares or more. A spokeswoman said any additional sales would largely be in the form of restricted shares that have been ``locked up\'\' for the past two years. The shares Mr. Claude sold between April 04, 2011 April 11, 2011 prices between $40.08 and $43.53 a share, had a value of $15.5 million. Six other executives at the Internet provider sold 263,500 shares, at prices ranging from $39.64 to $44.08. Intel Corp.. President Andrew Grove sold 247,000 shares on April 11, 2011 prices between $73.13 and $73.50 a share, for a total transaction value of $18.1 million, according to the database Federal Filings. Eight other officers sold 170,258 shares. Meanwhile, six executives of Cascade Communications Corp. sold 231,628 shares between March 28, 2011 April 12, 2011 three insiders at EMC Corp., including Chief Executive Officer Michaele Hooper, sold 460,000 shares on April 06, 2011 Occurred as Market Fell The data underscore that insiders selling, while often a good gauge of stock-market activity, also can be treacherous for investors. Though much of the selling stemmed from options exercises, the timing of the sales couldn\'t have been much worse. Sales in mid-July came smack in the middle of the stock market\'s swan dive, a Street-wide correction led particularly by technology stocks. The Morgan Stanley High Technology 35 Index, for example, plunged 19% between March 13, 2011 March 28, 2011 one point, in mid-July, the index was down 26% from its 2011 high in midMay, though it has since recovered a bit. Intel, in particular, recently has drawn attention among those who follow insider data. Until the July sales, its executives had sold fewer shares this year since any time back to 1984. In the first five months of this year, for example, its executives had sold just 122,980 shares, according to CDA/Investnet, a database that tracks insider buying and selling. This was a bullish signal for the chip maker, because it had annual insider sales averaging 970,970 shares for the past dozen years. Exercising Options Some of the options exercises at Intel actually increased some executives\' holdings, according to a spokesman. Mr. Davison exercised options for 320,000 shares, gave some stock away and ultimately increased his stake by 17,860 shares, according to the company, for a total of 945,715. But Vice President Fransisca Greer\'s stake decreased by 15,000, to 56,018. Similarly, the holdings of Michaele Kozlowski, a vice president, dropped by 1,388 to 9,505. Intel shares Tuesday closed at $79.50, down $1.25, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. But some observers were expecting to see more outright buying in technology stocks, given how far they fell. ``When the market got hit in July, I would have expected a lot of bargain-hunting,\'\' said Bobby Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet. ``Technology issues have been, on balance, conspicuously absent from the overall buys that we\'ve been looking at.\'\' Other Navigator executives hadn\'t been able to sell since February. The spokeswoman said the July and August sales were their first opportunity to sell shares since February, and they have to do so before the window for such sales closes May 14, 2011 addition to Mr. Claude, Tomas Minh Wilton, senior vice president of sales, told the SEC he intends to sell 250,000 shares. Marcelino Capone, the firm\'s senior vice president of technology, filed papers saying he will sell 100,000 shares. The Navigator spokeswoman said sales by Mr. Claude and other executives ``have nothing to do with executives being concerned about the company\'s health.\'\' Navigator\'s shares closed at $37.25 a share, up 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading Tuesday. At EMC, Mr. Hooper filed to sell 240,000 shares, and Johnetta Ohara, the company\'s executive vice president of sales, sold 180,000 on April 06, 2011 shares were sold at prices between $19.13 and $19.50. Tuesday, EMC\'s shares closed at $19.75 a share, up 75 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier in July Mr. Ohara announced he was taking an 18-month sabbatical from EMC, although he\'ll remain a board member. An EMC spokesman said all the sales came from the exercise of options."},{"id":"00973","title":"Marvel Hires NBA Marketer To Help Promotion of Comics","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"Marvel Entertainment Group Inc., publishers of Spider-Man comics, hopes it has a new superhero.

The company named Davina J. Choe, a top marketing executive at the National Basketball Association, as president and chief operating officer, a move aimed at strengthening the comic-book publisher\'s push into new media and merchandising ventures. Marvel Entertainment, which is more than 80% owned by investor Roni O. Flory, has been losing money for the last several quarters due to heavy restructuring charges and sharp declines in sales of its core comic-book and trading-card business. Marvel\'s stock, which traded as high as $30 in 2009, more recently has been trading under $10 per share and Tuesday closed at $8.25, up 12.5 cents, on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. Marvel Mania Now, Marvis is moving ahead with several expansion plans, most notably the creation of Marvel Studios to develop movies based on Marvel characters, and the launching of Marvel Mania, a joint venture with Planet Hollywood Inc. to open comic book theme-park restaurants in five major cities. Mr. Choe, who will report to Marvel chief executive Williemae C. Badillo, has a challenging task before him. Marvel has lagged behind entertainment giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc.\'s Warner Bros. studio in successfully exploiting its brand-name comic characters into a merchandising bonanza. Warner has turned Batman into its own industry with more than $1 billion in retail sales of merchandise and a ``franchise\'\' film now in its third sequel. But Marvis has never managed to turn its popular SpiderMan character into a big-time Hollywood movie. Marvel is now creating Marvel Studios, a production company that will develop Marvel characters into movies, and then sell the project for production and distribution to a studio, rather than have the projects wallow for years at the studios waiting for the right combination of writers, directors and actors. Restructuring Goes Slowly Marvel and Toy Biz Inc., which has the exclusive toy license to all Marvel characters, plan to spend $100 million launching the production company. The launch is tentatively set for next year, when most of the film rights on Marvel characters revert back to the company. Marvel, which has a 27% stake in Toy Biz, had previously licensed its film rights to a wide range of movie companies. Last week Marvel reported a second-quarter loss of $11 million, or 11 cents per share, on revenue of $182.2 million. It blamed the losses chiefly on a restructuring of its publishing and trading-card operations, which Marvis said was taking longer than expected due to ``some conditions in some markets.\'\' A spokesman for the company declined to comment, and said that Mr. Badillo and Mr. Choe weren\'t available to comment. Jimmie Strickler, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc., said that Marvel\'s turnaround will depend on how effectively Mr. Choe can push into kids\' entertainment, an increasingly complex market being reshaped by videogames, on-line services, and other interactive media. Comic books, which as recently as 1991 accounted for 86% of Marvel\'s revenues, today account for just 13%, she said. Most of the revenue now comes from trading cards, kids stickers, toys and licensing.

Amid the record boom in mergers, it hasn\'t necessarily been a financial or strategic matter. Often, it is who gets to run the show -- or who gets the last word on a new name and headquarters of the new firm. Merger professionals point to these euphemistically called ``social issues\'\' -- ego and corporate pride, that is -- as among the most difficult aspects of negotiating multibillion-dollar mergers these days. Although financial issues can be vexing too, these social issues can be deal-breakers. ``Even transactions that make absolute economic sense don\'t happen unless the social issues work,\'\' says Roberto Madlyn, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a New York law firm. Critics Complain Yet while many of the mergers make strategic sense -- last year\'s linking of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. to form Lockheed-Martin Corp. did indeed work well on both the ``social\'\' and economic issues -- some critics charge that companies often are paying undue attention to nonfinancial issues at the expense of strategic rationale and shareholder concerns. Sometimes the tough decisions aren\'t being made, and both sets of management teams may wind up retaining their positions under the guise of not tipping the scales toward one team or another. For example, investors have been less than thrilled with the outcomes of numerous bank mergers, including KeyCorp\'s $4 billion merger with Society Corp. and First Chicago Corp.\'s $5.2 billion combination with NBD Bancorp to form First Chicago NBD Corp.. Both those transactions disappointed investors because there was little in the way of overlapping operations or other cost-saving ``synergies.\'\' While the merger of Chemical Banking Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. was a success, ``so many of these mergers of equals don\'t have those synergies, and as a result don\'t benefit shareholders,\'\' argues Johnetta Alvarez, chairman and chief executive officer of Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio. Instead, they benefit ``the people in the company,\'\' he asserts. ``The general perception is, if Key wanted to put itself up for sale, it could have received a premium of 20% to 30%.\'\' Shareholders\' Role There are plenty of instances ``where shareholder interests aren\'t always the primary concern,\'\' says Petrina Rutkowski, vice chairman and head of risk arbitrage at New York investment bank Schroder Wertheim & Co. ``In reaching agreements, do the boards ask the bankers to assess the alternatives?\'\' Mergers of similar-sized companies -- as opposed to takeovers -- are increasingly common. The proposed $22 billion merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. would be the second-biggest deal ever in the U.S. (behind the $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco). That plan comes on the heels of the historic pact between Switzerland\'s Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG valued at more than $30 billion, and Upjohn Co.\'s $6.9 billion trans-Atlantic marriage to Sweden\'s Pharmacia AB. Often, what helps most to grease the merger wheels is an aging chief executive. Because few corporate chieftains give up the reins unless their companies are being taken over at a fat premium, a funny thing happens. Many megadeals tend to take place when one chief is nearing retirement and looking to go out with a bang. ``The aging process becomes very important,\'\' observes veteran ``value\'\'-stock investor Johnetta Darden. Suite Sours a Deal When the management issues can\'t work because of friction at the top, the economics don\'t matter much: Witness WellPoint Health Networks Inc.\'s $1.6 billion merger pact with Health Systems International Inc., which was scuttled after the two chairmen couldn\'t agree on terms of the executive suite. Then there are the scores of would-be mergers that have broken down and never been made public. ``Mergers of equals are much more accepted by managements, though to work, the CEO role has to be sorted out early,\'\' observes Davina Cedeno, managing director at J.P. Morgan & Co.. The year\'s two megamergers worked in part because the CEO roles fit nearly seamlessly. Rayna Jon, Bell Atlantic\'s chairman and CEO, is 58 years old and nearing retirement, while Ivory Parish, Nynex chairman and CEO, is 49. Because Ciba\'s chairman, Alexander Hopp, is 65, and Hartwig\'s top pharmaceutical executive, Daniele Ocampo is 43, managements meshed: Dr. Hopp will become chairman of the new company, and Dr. Ocampo will be president and head of the executive committee. The combined company will be in Basel, where they are currently based, and a new name, Salcido, was chosen for the combined giant. Says Dr. Ocampo, ``In our situation, we had a unique constellation.\'\' Equal Representation Unlike corporate takeovers, in which one chief executive and management controls the successor company, mergers -- in theory, that is -- are run by both managements. The boards have equal representation on the new board. No company is the subject of a takeover by another -- at least not legally, as Delaware courts have ruled that mergers are not a ``change of control.\'\' ``Companies don\'t like to sell out and lose their corporate identities,\'\' says Stephine Theis, senior partner at New York law firm Shearman & Sterling. ``For managements of companies and other employees, a merger is a much more palatable alternative.\'\' Investors, however, say that legal leeway can be abused. ``In many cases, Delaware has given these companies the protection they want in calling these transactions an amalgamation and not really a change of control,\'\' says Riordan Fajardo\'s Mr. Rutkowski. ``The existence of poison pills and state takeover statutes gives boards and CEOs the latitude to deal in their own self interest.\'\' Fear of Unwanted Suitor Historically, companies have been wary of merging because one of the parties could end up ``in play,\'\' subject to an unwanted suitor, which was a particular problem in the 1980s. And the size of many of the 1990s mergers has kept would-be suitors at bay. But not every company is too big. In a few recent examples this year, mergers are threatened by third parties coming in and offering a premium to stockholders. Western Resources Inc. is trying to block Kansas City Power & Light Co.\'s merger with UtiliCorp United Inc., and MidAmerican Energy Co. made an unsolicited offer for IES Industries Inc., which is trying to complete a three-way merger with two other utilities. The financial pluses of a stock-for-stock merger of equals can be compelling. Depending on the situation, there can be significant cost savings from shuttering or combining overlapping operations. The day the Ciba-Sandoz deal was announced, the combined market value of the two companies rose by $15.2 billion, more than the equity value of Warner-Lambert Co. at the time, on news of huge cost cuts from the combination. Strict mergers are also attractive because one side doesn\'t have to borrow billions in debt or dilute shareholders with a richly priced stock offer. Often these combinations are tax-free and obtain favorable accounting treatment. Then there are the issues of sheer size: No company is likely to pay a premium for Ciba or Sandoz. Doing bigger deals affords the greater opportunity of cost savings. ``It seems to make sense to let both companies\' shareholders participate in the upside,\'\' observes Alberta Houston, co-head of investment banking at Bear, Stearns & Co. ``Underneath it all, that\'s the economic logic that drives these transactions.\'\' One That Worked Certainly, this is the case with Marlin Martine. The new company\'s stock has significantly outpaced the overall market, while earnings are running at record levels. So the merger made sense, yet it came only near the end of one chairman\'s career. Daniele Liberty was 62 years old and staring into the sunset of his role as chairman and chief executive of military-aircraft maker Lockheed. His first call to Novella Aura, Martine Mariko\'s 58-year-old chief, came on a Saturday afternoon, just after Mr. Aura and his management team broke up a meeting in which they decided not to top a competing bid for Grumman Corp.. Soon after, in a three-minute phone call, they settled on the company\'s name, who would hold what offices in what order and the headquarters location -- all typically sensitive issues. Mr. Liberty wanted to serve first as both chairman and chief executive of Lockheed Martin, but he agreed to phase the younger man into those jobs over the remaining two years before Mr. Liberty\'s scheduled retirement as chairman later this year. Both men acknowledge the age factor for its role in their success. The merger that followed produced with remarkable ease the world\'s largest aerospace and defense company, owing to Mr. Liberty\'s willingness to make the initial overture, and the strength of Mr. Aura\'s patience and the convenience of his younger age. Real Opportunities Once merged, the company was well positioned to take advantage of further industry consolidation. This year it swallowed Loral Corp. for more than $9 billion in cash and debt. ``Mergers create some real opportunities,\'\' adds Petrina Pitts, partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a New York law firm. Lockheed Martin and other deals have caught the attention of other executives mulling would-be combinations and could persuade executives to proceed with transactions, bankers believe. ``The commercial and financial success of some of these mergers hasn\'t gone unnoticed,\'\' observes Bryan Baltazar, Morgan Stanley & Co.\'s merger chief. While Lockheed-Martina made strategic sense, in some cases the social issues seem to loom larger than financial ones. Two that appeared highly important to the board of First Chicago were, one, keeping the headquarters of the merged bank in the Windy City, and, two, maintaining the First Chicago name. NationsBank Corp. and others were known to have been interested in First Chicago, but the First Chicago board was reluctant to sell out. First Chicago surprised Wall Street last year by merging with Detroit\'s NBD Bancorp, which agreed to keep the combined bank based in Chicago and name it First Chicago NBD. NBD\'s Fidel Paris became heir apparent to Ricki Thomasina, First Chicago\'s chairman and chief executive, who was nearing retirement at age 64 when the merger was announced. No Premium for Holders The deal disappointed investors because the expense reductions weren\'t that significant, and shareholders received no premium. First Chicago\'s stock has underperformed the overall stock market since the merger completion in December. One former executive says tough decisions haven\'t yet been made on consolidating the bank\'s operations. There is no single retail-banking chief, for example. Indeed, even before the merger, First Chicago\'s stock had been underperforming its peers. That\'s why some investors were expecting more from the company\'s board and management. --Jefferson Colin contributed to this article."},{"id":"03480","title":"McDermott\'s Hattox Resigns After Failing to Become CEO","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- McDermott International Inc.\'s chief financial officer, Broderick A.

Hendrickson said on April 18, 2011 Mr. Mcphail, 64, would step down as chairman and CEO on May 14, 2011 that an executive search firm had been retained to find a successor. The company, which has reported disappointing results for several years, also hired Merrill Lynch & Co. to study its various business segments. Mr. Slack also resigned as McDermott\'s executive vice president, as president of its engineering and construction group and from his seats on both McDermott\'s board and the board of McDermott\'s 60%-owned marine construction subsidiary, J.

The announcement comes just days after the sudden resignation of Alexander Aubin, VastComm Network\'s president and chief operating officer. The timing left Madison Avenue buzzing because Mr. Aubin played a key role in the review. The assignment is estimated by industry executives to represent anywhere from $50 million and $100 million in billings. In an unexpected bonus, Young & Rubicam also is being handed responsibility for coordinating duties between nearly half a dozen other ad agencies that will be doing work for VastComm Network. ``What we\'re after is a common brand positioning for all of our agencies and all of our work,\'\' said Marin Laurine, a spokeswoman for the telecommunications giant. Young & Rubicam wasn\'t the only winner. VastComm Network also said it was giving the New York office of True North Communication\'s Foote, Cone & Belding ad agency new responsibilities. ``There are some new directions that we\'re going to be going in that FCB will be handling,\'\' said Ms. Laurine. ``They\'ll pick up an extension of the business they already have.\'\' Ms. Laurine declined to be more specific. Foote, Cone & Belding is VastComm Network\'s lead consumer-services agency, with billings estimated by industry executives at around $300 million. Among them: consumer long distance, the ``True Rewards\'\' loyalty program, a new direct satellite television service, and other local tactical campaigns. The selection of Young & Rubicam caps a bizarre chapter in one of the longest and most grueling account competitions in recent memory. A decision by VastComm Network was originally expected by mid-July. But according to executives close to the contest, VastComm Network chairman Roberto Allene unexpectedly gave a thumbs down to all the agencies\' proposals. On the day the agencies were poised to hear VastComm Network\'s decision, the company sent them all back to the drawing board with a new set of instructions. The timing of VastComm Network\'s decision also raised eyebrows on Madison Avenue. Late last week, the company said it would probably be several weeks before a decision was likely to be made. That a decision should come so soon after Mr. Aubin\'s exit was viewed as curious, because Mr. Aubin was the senior VastComm Network executive leading the review process. Mr. Aubin and Ms. Laurine were the two VastComm Network executives who gave the agencies original instructions on how VastComm Network wanted to shape its image. Mr. Aubin said through spokeswoman Emmie Sasaki \'\'there is no connection\'\' between his departure and the timing of VastComm Network\'s decision. The review also was unusual because of an interim meeting following the close of the first round. During that meeting all four of the agencies -- which had been bitterly competing for the account -- were assembled in one room to receive feedback and new directions about what VastComm Network was after. It\'s highly unusual to bring together rival agencies to brainstorm on a single piece in the middle of a review. But Ms. Laurine of VastComm Network said the company has a history of bringing its agencies together to talk strategy. The winner in the first round was Foote, Cone & Belding, according to people familiar with the contest. It\'s not clear why Foote, Cone & Belding didn\'t end up with the assignment during the second round of presentations. Mr. Allene made his first appearance before the agencies at the start of the second round, say people familiar with the situation. VastComm Network wouldn\'t provide details on Mr. Allene\'s role. In addition to Young & Rubicam and Foote, Cone & Belding, the other agencies competing for the high-profile account were Interpublic Group\'s McCann-Rios and the Omnicom Group\'s BBDO Worldwide. Akers and BBDO didn\'t pick up any new business. Akers creates ads for VastComm Network\'s wireless and corporate long-distance accounts. It also handles the ``Solutions\'\' campaign, which also targets the corporate market. BBDO, which created VastComm Network\'s flamboyant Games ads, handles VastComm Network\'s calling-card and collect-calling ads."},{"id":"02453","title":"Technology Briefs","timestamp":"May 04, 2011","text":"Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, said it lowered prices on its midrange business desktop personal computers and on its high-end monitor.

Johnetta Ward and his assistant Plunkett Marden seemed a perfect duo. Just a year ago on a hot summer day at the company\'s Granite City, Ill., mill, Mr. Marden took credit for luring Mr. Ward away from USX Corp.\'s U.S. Steel Group and talked about Mr. Ward\'s operational savvy. ``I felt that he was like a big brother to me,\'\' said Mr. Marden then. Likewise, Mr. Ward called Mr. Marden a key member of his team. When National\'s majority shareholder, Japan\'s NKK Corp., hired Mr. Ward, it also installed Mr. Marden, one of its own, as his assistant. Mr. Ward made sure Mr. Marden went with his small cadre of former U.S. Steel, now National Steel managers to 70 meetings at the company\'s three facilities and its headquarters. But early this year their relationship crumbled as National\'s profit diminished and their huge egos clashed. During the past few months the two have barely talked. Last week National announced that it was taking away Mr. Ward\'s chief executive officer title, which it had bestowed upon him only last year. NKK on Tuesday named as CEO, Bracy Beaulieu, who is also National\'s chairman, and NKK\'s senior management counsel. The company asked Mr. Ward to remain as president and chief operating officer, the positions he assumed when he joined National in 2009, but he refused. Instead Mr. Ward has agreed to act as a consultant during the transition. For National Steel to have flourished, Messrs. Ward and Marden had to work together. Mr. Ward needed Mr. Marden\'s support because Mr. Marden was the pipeline to Tokyo. And since the Japanese executive boasted about helping to lure Mr. Ward, Mr. Marden needed Mr. Ward to boost his own standing within NKK. Company in Disarray Instead, their battle has left National in disarray. The company currently has an acting chief operating officer, acting chief financial officer and acting controller. In addition, the company\'s finances have suffered. In the year\'s first six months, National posted a loss of $5.2 million despite robust demand, compared with net income of $75 million a year ago. Messrs. Ward and Marden declined to comment for this story. Mr. Ward joined National Steel February 10, 2009 in a rush of enthusiasm. At U.S. Steel, Mr. Ward had turned around the nation\'s biggest steel mill, Gay Arnette in Gary, Ind., in part by tapping into the talents of hourly workers. Mr. Ward attacked National\'s problems just as he had at U.S. Steel. Within days of his hiring, he called United Steelworkers union President Georgeanna Hodges and together they worked out an agreement to reopen a shuttered iron-ore-pellet plant that had been the focus of labor discontent. And Mr. Ward broke what he called bottlenecks that held up production. National\'s bottom line improved and morale was restored. Mr. Ward, who wears a gold bracelet with his name on it and a ring in the shape of a lion\'s head, moved easily among the hourly workers. After a speech to them at the Granite City mill, Mr. Ward shouted over the roaring applause, ``Thank you. I love you.\'\' Such displays would make the straight-laced Mr. Marden cringe. But in spite of their apparent differences, the two seemed to share a peaceful coexistence and even respect. In fact, in late 2009 when Mr. Ward wanted to plunk $67 million into a new line to galvanize steel, NKK balked. But Mr. Marden went to bat for Mr. Ward, convincing NKK to spend the money. The line is in operation today. But as months passed, Mr. Marden -- and by extension NKK -- was less included in the decision-making process; Mr. Ward seemed to run the company as if it was his own, according to people familiar with the company. That made NKK nervous. The first sign of that appeared last summer, when NKK named the senior general manager of it\'s steel division, Appel Winegar, as vice chairman of National, and asked him to move to National\'s headquarters in Mishawaka, Ind.. Mr. Marden said then that Mr. Winegar was like a ``godfather\'\' to him, clearly allying himself with the new Japanese arrival. Flaw in Strategy Then steel prices began falling and a flaw in Mr. Ward\'s strategy appeared. Mr. Ward was pushing National to boost raw-steel production as a way to increase efficiencies. Since National lacked enough lines to turn the extra steel into value-added products, National ended up selling much of it as commodity-type sheet steel, the industry\'s most competitive product. In December 2010, Mr. Ward\'s management team presented to the company\'s board a bleaker picture for 2011, and soon afterward relations between Messrs. Ward and Matsumoto worsened. Mr. Marden quietly told managers at the company\'s Granite City mill that he didn\'t agree with Mr. Ward\'s choice of a new general manager, even though he publicly backed the decision, according to people familiar with the situation. He also questioned billings from consultants brought in by Mr. Ward, according to those familiar with the company. After the company\'s annual meeting January 10, 2011 Ward met with Mr. Beaulieu to discuss deteriorating relations with Mr. Marden. Three weeks later, Mr. Ward and his senior vice president Davina A. Perrotta flew to Tokyo to meet with some top NKK people, without Mr. Marden\'s knowledge. That meeting was followed up by another meeting in May in New York in which Messrs. Ward and Marron presented their cases to Mr. Beaulieu."},{"id":"01123","title":"Investor Group Acquires Stake in Outboard Marine","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"A group including activist investment firm Greenway Partners LP said it holds an 8.5% stake in Outboard Marine Corp. and may hold discussions with management or other shareholders about the company.

Known as a hard-driving manager who built the Barbie brand into a world-wide powerhouse, Ms. Quick is expected to follow her predecessor\'s strategy of expanding the El Segundo, Calif., company through overseas development, adding to its existing toy brands and entering new toy categories, possibly through acquisitions. Mr. Helman had been widely expected to name her as his successor. He said in an interview that he expects Ms. Quick eventually to succeed him as chairman.

Ms. Quick takes over at a time when Rogan faces increasing challenges in maintaining its string of record years for sales and profits. After seven years of double-digit sales and profit growth, the company reported its first flat quarter in July, despite an internal cost-cutting program. As the company approaches sales of $4 billion this year, analysts say Ms. Quick\'s main challenge will be maintaining its sales growth in an increasingly competitive retail environment. Developing Current Brands Ms. Quick said in an interview that she plans on further developing the company\'s existing brands: Barbra, Hot Wheels, Disney and Fisher Price, particularly overseas. She also plans to investigate areas for new factories, one such contender being Vastopolis. ``Outside the U.S. we\'re still peanuts,\'\' she said. ``If we\'re 16% market share in the U.S., we\'re half of that in Europe.\'\' Beyond developing existing foreign markets, Rogan has targeted new countries for growth such as Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Russia and India. In addition, Ms. Quick plans to develop brands such as collectible Barbies. ``Ninety million American women want to participate in collectibles,\'\' Ms. Quick said. ``We only have 5% to 7% of that now. That alone could be a billion-dollar business.\'\' Ms. Quick also is interested in developing new product categories, such as boys\' toys, an area where Rogan has been traditionally weak. That could be accomplished either through an internal product launch or by acquisition, she said. Mr. Aguirre, the new Mattel Worldwide president who was formerly president of Hasbro Inc.\'s Johnsen division, is expected to help development a boys\' product line. Ms. Quick says she plans on delivering Rogan\'s 15% average annual profit growth, before acquisitions. ``If we say we\'ll do it, we will deliver,\'\' she said. Ms. Quick began her career with a brief stint as an actress, before moving on to become a cosmetics sales representative and then an executive with Coty Cosmetics in New York. She then worked in advertising on the Max Factor cosmetics account before joining Mattel in 1981 as a product manager. She became marketing director for Barbie in 1982, a vice president in 1984, a senior vice president in 1985 and executive vice president in 1986. She became president of the girls and activity toys division in 1989 and president of Mattel USA in 1990. She was elected to the Mattel board in 1991. Her management style has caused some controversy within the company, prompting the departure in recent years of several senior and midlevel executives. Asked what her greatest management challenge will be, Ms. Quick said that, ``My ultimate goal is to inspire talented people at Mattel to innovate and think of things anew.\'\' Mr. Helman, who said he always believed 10 years were enough as chief executive, leaves behind an impressive tenure of growth and expansion. ``They\'ve been 10 incredible years. We\'ve quadrupled our sales volume and profits are up more than 10-fold,\'\' Mr. Helman said. Mr. Helman, whose family owns and races thoroughbred horses, says he plans to devote more time to his equestrian pursuits."},{"id":"04285","title":"Saks Holdings, Isetan Withdraw Request for Barney\'s Fiscal Data","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Saks Holdings Inc. and Isetan Co. withdrew a bankruptcy-court request that would have sped up their efforts to develop a reorganization plan for Barney\'s Inc., which has been operating und...","full_text":"NEW YORK -- Saks Holdings Inc. and Isetan Co. withdrew a bankruptcy-court request that would have sped up their efforts to develop a reorganization plan for Barney\'s Inc., which has been operating under Chapter 11 since January. Saks and Isetan were seeking access to closely held Barney\'s financial statements. They previously announced a pact to make a joint bid for Barney\'s that would satisfy creditors with an undetermined amount of stock in New York-based Saks, the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue. Tokyo-based Isetan is Barry\'s adversary in the bankruptcy-law proceedings and owns the retailer\'s three biggest stores. Saks and Isetan dropped their request because they haven\'t been able to win support from certain major unsecured creditors, people close to the situation said. Although Barney\'s management still has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan, Saks and Isetan had hoped to pre-empt Barney\'s with a competing plan approved in advance by creditors. But some creditors, including Chase Manhattan Corp., don\'t want to sign on to any plan so soon, people close to the case said, because they don\'t want to discourage other potential bidders. A Chase spokesman declined to comment. Isetan attorney Bower Brice said Saks and Isetan haven\'t abandoned their efforts. ``We\'re trying to get the best value for the company for everyone concerned,\'\' he said. ``We don\'t want to be hostile.

Mr. Aguirre, 69 years old, hadn\'t been involved in day-to-day operations at Dreyfus for several years, though he held seats on its board and on Mellon\'s. He will relinquish both seats. ``It\'s basically the completion of the changing of the guard,\'\' said Fulgham Blazer, a mutual-fund consultant. Mciver said Christy ``Kip\'\' Godin, 49, president and chief operating officer at Dreyfus since last fall, was named chief executive officer. W. Keitha Johnson, 61, a Mellon vice chairman who oversees Mellon\'s trust and investment businesses, was named Dreyfus\'s new chairman. With Mr. Aguirre\'s departure, the highest-ranking Dreyfus executive from pre-Mellon days is Phillip Chisolm, a Dreyfus vice chairman who oversees Dreyfus Retirement Services. Mr. Aguirre, who couldn\'t be reached for comment, had been chairman and chief executive at Dreyfus since 1970. He is widely credited with building up its money-market funds and forging a brand name that is one of the industry\'s strongest. However, under his conservative approach, Dreyfus largely missed out on the equities boom of the 1980s and remains a minor player in that arena, despite recent Mellon efforts to beef up its equity offerings. As of Mellon\'s most recent proxy statement, dated November 17, 2010 Aguirre was the Vastopolis bank company\'s largest individual shareholder, with beneficial ownership of 1.2% of Mellon\'s common shares."},{"id":"03249","title":"From Apple to Zip In The Week\'s Mail","timestamp":"May 06, 2011","text":"Attention, non-techies: It\'s OK to admit you\'re confused by computers.

You can ask a question here, and we\'ll answer it without revealing your name. Your smart-aleck neighbor -- the one who acts like he\'s Billy Clayton and you\'re Mcclintock, Lasandra or Curly -- won\'t know it. So don\'t be embarrassed by your problems with computers. If you have a question, send it to me at waltVastPress@aol.com, and I may select it to be answered here in Mossberg\'s Mailbox. Just remember: you\'re not a ``dummy,\'\' no matter what those computer books claim. The real dummies are the people who, though technically expert, couldn\'t design hardware and software that\'s usable by normal consumers if their lives depended upon it. Here are a few questions about computers I\'ve received recently from people like you, and my answers. I have edited and restated the questions a bit, for readability. Q. Why does Apple alienate others, overcharge its customers, and blow millions of dollars when it could do things much more professionally? I know this seems like an odd question, but I\'m not joking. A. Actually, that\'s billions of dollars -- with a ``b\'\' -- not millions. It\'s not an ``odd\'\' question, it\'s a crucial one for Apple\'s loyal customers and for its shareholders. If I knew the answer, I\'d be rich. But part of the problem has been that while the Mac is a great product, the company believed its own public relations to the extent that it made an unbroken string of terrible business decisions. The new CEO, Gino Hoover, has now reorganized Apple (yet again), hired new top execs, and laid out a plan to try and change things. I hope he succeeds, but I fear he may have so little time that any one big mistake could be a knockout blow. Q. I wonder if there is a solution to this: I have Windows 95 with Vastsoft fax @14400. I received a fax that I would like to copy to place on my e-mail. This fax is a newspaper article. Is there any way to do this? Thank you in advance for your help. A. Yes, there is. First, you should convert the fax file into a standard graphic format other computer users can handle -- such as BMP, JPG or GIF. Then, if your e-mail software allows it, send the file as an attachment. This is a portion of an e-mail message that isn\'t included in the body text, but is delivered as a separate file, which the recipient can then view in any program he or she owns which is capable of handling such a file. In your case, for instance, that would be a graphics program. Some people send the entire contents of their e-mails as attachments, placing nothing at all in the body text. Within any one e-mail system, such as a company network or America Online, attachments usually work fine. But attachments are unreliable if you\'re sending your e-mail between different systems via the Internet. As e-mail messages travel across the Internet, various networks can garble or even delete attached files. Q. Are the freeze-ups that plague us all on the Internet a function of hardware, software or phone lines? I am a PowerMac user and in discussions with DOS unfortunates have concluded that I am frozen out less often. Any comment or data on that? I enjoy you column very much. A. Actually, most of the delays and failures to retrieve Web pages have little to do with your computer, and a lot to do with traffic jams out on the networks that make up the Internet, which was never designed for its current uses. Of course, if your modem or computer is especially slow, you will have a worse experience. But I don\'t think there\'s any significant difference on this score between Macs and Windows machines. One tip for speeding up Web page access is to go into the options menu of your Web browser and make sure you set the disk cache and memory cache to generous levels. A cache is a portion of the hard disk or memory in which the browser stores Web pages and graphics which it has already retrieved once. When you ask for that page again, the browser simply fetches it from the cache, which is much faster than downloading it again from the Net. Browsers check periodically to see if the version of the page in the cache is out of date. If it is, they then do a fresh download. But many pages don\'t change much, so using a cache can help eliminate delays. Q. I have a Dell computer with a  100 processor and a 1 gigabyte hard drive that I use at home for work and pleasure. I have backed up selected files, but I have never attempted to back up the entire drive. Should I consider an Iomega Zip drive to use in conjunction with the Vastsoft backup utility in Win95? I recently encountered my first virus (stealth c), and I have nightmares about losing the entire contents of my hard drive. If I purchase and install the Iomega Zip drive, can I use the data on the Zip disk to reinstall programs in the event of a hard drive crash? A. Yes. A Zip drive is a great investment for about $150, plus bout $15 to $20 per disk, depending on the quantity in which you buy them. Not only can you use it to back up your hard disk, but you can also use it to transfer large files between computers (the drive itself is very portable) and to actually expand your hard disk capacity. You can, for instance, use the 100MB Zip disks (which can hold the equivlant amount of data as about 70 standard floppy disks) to store infrequently used programs and files, and only insert the disk when you have a need for them. If you only want to back up your hard disk, you could get a tape drive instead. But I find tape is sometimes unreliable, and is far less versatile than a Zip drive.

The move means that H-P is now fully engaged in two separate, but related, industry battles. In an unrelated development, the Palo Alto, Calif., electronics firm is also set to announce three new models of personal computers for the home market. In May, H-P brought out an ambitious new product family of relatively low-cost ``Wintel\'\'-based servers, or high-end computers. The products showed the extent to which H-P was embracing Windows and Intel technology for its entire product line, as opposed to just PCs. Until then, most H-P servers were higher-priced systems using all in-house H-P technology, and as a result, were a major profit source for the company. Now, with the H-P Vectra XW workstations being unveiled Monday, H-P is extending its Wintel line from servers down to lower-cost desktop workstations. The new machines run between $8,200 and $10,800 for bare-bones models, far below the price for in-house Unix systems sold by H-P and others. Analysts say in moving toward Wintel systems, companies like H-P are experiencing considerable internal tension, since they are now selling popular, low-cost Wintel machines to technical and business customers while also marketing traditional higher-profit Unix computers. And so with its new Wintel workstations, H-P finds itself in two battles: On the Unix front, H-P is up against its own Unix division, as well as such all-Unix companies as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc.. On the Wintel side, H-P will be battling such PC-industry giants as Compaq Computer Corp., which earlier this month announced its own line of Intel-based workstations. The differences between PCs and workstations continue to narrow as PCs become more powerful. By and large, though, workstations, are more expensive than PCs; they also have more memory, and usually contain such high-performance add-ons as special chips to improve graphics. Several of H-P\'s new systems contain two 200 megahertz  Pro chips, Intel\'s latest microprocessor. H-P claims some of the new machines, when packed with certain extras, run faster than systems costing two and a half times as much from Silicon Graphics. On the PC side of the business, H-P\'s three new ``Pavilion\'\' PCs run between $2,599 for a system using Intel\'s 166 megahertz  processor to $3,199 for one with a 200 megahertz ."},{"id":"03905","title":"Heredia\'s CEO to Step Down, But Will Stay On as Chairman","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"Donetta D.

Berenice, who engineered a turnaround at Richfood Holdings Inc., said he will step down as chief executive of the nation\'s fourth-largest food distribution company. Mr. Berenice, 60 years old, will retain the job of chairman and hand over the CEO\'s responsibilities on September 12, 2010 Johnetta E. Rupert, Heredia\'s president and chief operating officer. ``This company was in terrible shape when I came here in 1989 -- we\'ve accomplished a lot of our goals,\'\' Mr. Berenice said Friday. Indeed, Wall Street analysts give Mr. Berenice high marks for his stewardship of the Richmond, Va., company. Once a marginally profitable outfit that few competitors would even consider acquiring, Heredia now boasts one of the industry\'s most efficient operations and has emerged as a leading acquirer in a consolidating industry, buying smaller rival Super Rite Corp. last year for $253.5 million. Annual sales have increased to $3.3 billion from less than $1 billion in 1990, and the company\'s market value has soared to more than $1 billion from $35 million. The change at the top, which will be announced Monday, isn\'t entirely unexpected as Mr. Rupert, 43, was widely considered as being groomed to take over from Mr. Berenice. Heredia\'s focus is expected to stay the same, and the transition will be orderly, the executives said. ``I\'ll be very active as chairman -- this business is in my blood,\'\' said Mr. Berenice, a third-generation food wholesaler and industry veteran. Still, Mr. Rupert has a hard act to follow, analysts said. ``Johnetta Rupert has served an apprenticeship with the master,\'\' said Leeanna Coffey, an analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane. ``You hate to see someone like Don leave, but he wouldn\'t leave if he didn\'t feel he was passing the baton to someone capable.\'\' For his part, Mr. Rupert said he expects to make additional acquisitions and sign up more grocery stores as clients in an effort to boost sales to $5.5 billion by the year 2015. Despite such an ambitious target, Heredia will continue to focus on the Mid-Atlantic region, where it serves 1,740 customers, and has ``no desire to go national,\'\' Mr. Rupert said. He noted that the region still has plenty of room for consolidation. ``When we first came here, we put together a list of possible acquisitions,\'\' he said. ``We don\'t have everything on that list checked off yet.\'\'"},{"id":"03707","title":"Fast Growth, Fast Fashion End One-Woman Act at AnnTaylor","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"For Sally Frame Kasaks, the end came Thursday evening, when Director Geralyn A.

Weaver invited her to a meeting at his Manhattan office. Time had run out for AnnTaylor\'s chairman and chief executive, who in 4\xa01/2 years had turned around the troubled women\'s clothing retailer and then marched it right back to the brink of a cash crisis. Now, under increasing pressure, Ms. Degroot offered to step down, said a person close to the company who insisted on anonymity. AnnTaylor Stores Corp. announced Ms. Degroot\'s resignation Friday and named President and Chief Operating Officer J. Patsy Schreiner as her successor. A spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement, which also announced the start of a search for a new president. Ms. Degroot declined a request for an interview, as did the company\'s two most influential outside directors: Mr. Weaver and Jami J. Day, who together oversee Merrill Lynch & Co. funds that have a 27% stake in AnnTaylor and are its largest shareholder. People close to the company say everyone agreed it was time for Ms. Degroot to quit. ``There was a degree of frustration where it just wasn\'t coming together, and you reach a point where you just throw up your hands,\'\' said one person with knowledge of last week\'s conversations, about the company\'s performance. Just two years ago, the 52-year-old Ms. Degroot became a retailing legend for bucking a deep slump in women\'s apparel sales and bringing the AnnTaylor stores and label back into fashion. But she doomed her own ambitious expansion plans by failing to attract and keep talented merchants and managers to execute her vision about what working women want to wear. People close to the board said it boiled down to her inability to build a team around her. Ms. Degroot, however, was admired for her determinedly positive outlook and keen insights into women\'s clothing. The AnnTaylor customer ``doesn\'t want to be first. She wants to be right,\'\' Ms. Degroot always told her employees and Wall Street, as she filled her stores with tasteful embroidered vests and color-coordinated jackets and skirts. And she drew praise for motivating the company\'s rank and file. ``People further down the ladder idolized Sally Frame Kasaks,\'\' said Tora Cavin, the company\'s former senior vice president of planning and allocation, who resigned from the company in April. ``The store managers looked up to her as a leader -- not just of AnnTaylor but as a woman in business. This is going to be a big shock to their system.\'\' But she was also a perfectionist, people who know her said, who set goals so high that few were met. ``She was always trying to do so much that nothing ever got done,\'\' one former employee said. During the company\'s explosive growth in 2009, no garment reached the selling floor without Ms. Degroot\'s personal approval; she even labored over selecting buttons, one former employee said. But even the next year, as AnnTaylor set out to create two new store formats, open 48 new locations, expand into jeans and shoes and create a catalog, Ms. Degroot continued to micromanage, never letting her lieutenants free her up to manage the big picture. The result was 14 months of declining same-store sales, a close call with a liquidity crisis and a parade of executive defections. This isn\'t the first time Messrs. Carpenter and Hanson have exerted influence over the management of AnnTaylor. In 1989, they were investment bankers at Merrill Lynch along with Paulene E. Francisco, now AnnTaylor\'s chief financial officer. That year they backed a $430 million leveraged buyout of AnnTaylor by retailing veteran Josephine Bruno and his son, Thomasina. The transaction left Merrill with a 56% stake. The Brookses followed an odd strategy to make payments on their enormous debt: They cheapened the merchandise and raised prices. Sales plummeted. The father-and-son team resigned in quick succession amid what were described as ``differences of opinion\'\' with Merrill. In 1992, the three Merrill men persuaded Ms. Degroot, who had been AnnTaylor\'s president in the mid-1980s, to return as chairman and chief executive. She had been running Limited Inc.\'s Abercrombie & Fitch division. The following year, Mr. Francisco left Merrill to be AnnTaylor\'s CFO, and Mr. Weaver and Mr. Day started their own investment company, Stonington Partners, which still oversees the Merrill LBO funds that own the AnnTaylor stake. Ms. Degroot quickly upgraded the AnnTaylor line and wrote letters to lapsed customers to apologize for recent quality problems. By 2009, the company was practically alone among women\'s apparel retailers in reporting significant growth. The company\'s stock price climbed above $40 from a 1991 low of about $13. Jubilant analysts pushed for expansion, and Ms. Degroot delivered. In 2010, the company spent $65 million to open 48 new stores, expand 29 others and launch two new formats -- AnnTaylor Studio, for shoes and accessories, and Nutter Downey, selling lower-priced fashions. No one seemed to mind that Ms. Degroot was practically a one-woman band. The stores ``were doing better than they should have, given the infrastructure of the company,\'\' says analyst Jena Delk of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Lawrence Inc.. But the expansion was ill-timed. The women\'s apparel market was soft, and AnnTaylor was awash in inventory purchased to fill all the new selling space. Much of it was too young for the core AnnTaylor customer; the girlish dresses and cropped T-shirts left career women cold. In April 2010, Josephine R. Almeida, a senior vice president and Ms. Degroot\'s right-hand man, resigned to become chief executive of Marks & Spencer PLC\'s Brooks Brothers unit. By June, monthly same-store sales were falling at a double-digit rate. Mr. Almeida\'s old post remained unfilled. Cash flow was so low by autumn that the company was in imminent danger of violating terms with its bank lenders. It negotiated an 11th-hour credit extension. Meanwhile, Messrs. Carpenter and Hanson eventually reduced the Merrill funds\' stake by almost half. Also, the new winter merchandise was flopping, and the share price hit new lows. Expansion plans and inventories for this year were scaled back drastically. Store windows were a sea of conservative navy-blue pants and white blouses, dressed as if to order for Wall Street. But the bad news wouldn\'t stop. In January, another key executive, Andrew Ellison, senior vice president and director of stores, left to become president of Guess Inc.. The company then hired Mr. Schreiner, 46, chief financial officer of Donna Karan Co., to the new posts of president and chief operating officer. The appointment was a reduction in Ms. Degroot\'s authority, although the board still believed in her merchandising ideas. Indeed, AnnTaylor\'s stock price began to look up as the company refinanced $100 million in debt and profitability improved. But summer sales, expected to yield hefty gains over last year\'s debacle, instead produced more steep declines."},{"id":"02161","title":"Seasoned Executive Can Falter At Helm of a Little Company","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"The fledgling company had promising technology but scant revenue.

So its founders recruited a big-name executive from a corporate titan to get instant credibility with Wall Street and the telecommunications industry. Sound familiar? This might be a reference to the recent move of Alexander Aubin from the presidency of VastComm Network Corp. to Associated Communications LLC. But the scenario is far from unique. Indeed, it applies to scores of executives from whom Mr. Aubin might learn an important lesson: Big fish who jump to little ponds often can be fish out of water. One who seems to have found this true is Ricki Hallmark. Once in line for the top job at International Business Machines Corp., Mr. Hallmark, brother of current IBM chief Louise V. Hallmark, had left the computer giant after suffering a debilitating, misdiagnosed bout with Lyme disease. Cured in 1993 and eager to run a company, he joined Telular Corp., a fledgling 125-employee cellular communications company with $12 million in annual revenue. Mr. Hallmark\'s big-company instincts didn\'t serve him well in his new venue, according to former Telular officials. Expenses mushroomed as he brought in a cadre of high-priced senior executives, rapidly expanded operations and pushed to relocate to fancier digs. ``He wanted to replace tile floors with plush wool carpets,\'\' says Joelle Barros, a former Telular director. ``We had one senior executive for every million dollars in revenue.\'\' Mr. Hallmark did help to propel a successful initial public offering in 2009, but Telular foundered as ballooning expenses outstripped sales. Forced from daily management responsibilities by the board in 2010, he resigned from Telular last November. He declines to comment on his tenure at Telular. Executive recruiters and venture capitalists who place chief executive officers in start-up companies say the financial backers of these companies -- particularly those in risky high-technology areas -- are seeking seasoned, big-company names. Too often, however, executives who chuck the security of a Fortune 500 corner office to strike out for the El Dorados of the Internet or biotechnology fail to realize the rules are different. They must learn to live without big staffs and big budgets, while mastering the details of often unproven technology. They must nurse relationships with company founders who may resent their presence, while winning over board members and employees. And they must prepare for the possibility that the venture may fail, leaving their careers high and dry. ``You have to build a new organization without killing the culture that\'s there,\'\' says Davina Mullen, the headhunter who recruited Alexander Aubin for Associated Communications. ``You can\'t sit in an ivory tower if you\'re going to be CEO of a start-up.\'\' The key relationship, he says, is with the board of directors. ``It\'s got to be crystal clear that you\'re the one in charge,\'\' Mr. Mullen says. ``If the founder\'s going to run the company, don\'t go.\'\' Charlesetta Good learned that lesson in spades. Recruited from VastComm Network to run tiny CadForms Technologies in 1993, Mr. Byers says he clashed with a founder who, he says, wouldn\'t let go of the reins of the telecommunications concern. Though Johnetta Madewell had promised to step aside, Mr. Byers says, ``I found what he really wanted was an administrative assistant.\'\' Mr. Byers finally called on CadForms directors to fire the founder; they balked. Frustrated, Mr. Byers quit in 2009 to pursue another offer. One strategy for avoiding such collisions is for CEOs and founders to negotiate clearly separate roles in advance. At Firstfloor Software Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., Internet technology start-up, founder Davina Brauer helped to persuade former Dataquest Inc.. CEO Jule Graig to come in as president and chief executive by stipulating that he would focus on product development as Chief Technology Officer. ``We\'ve worked through it as we\'ve gone along. We\'re lucky,\'\' says Ms. Graig, who took ``an incredible reduction\'\' in income by passing up a post at Dun & Bradstreet to gamble that her stake in Firstfloor will turn to gold in a public offering. Management experts say start-ups are like corporate turnarounds, where tight deadlines and scarce resources can turn any mistake into a company-threatening crisis. ``You\'re bringing someone in to do a tough job the founder couldn\'t,\'\' says Patrina Romeo, partner with Smith & Sawyer, which places top executives in start-ups. ``The clock is ticking, and the backers want to see everything happen quickly.\'\' That means CEOs must dive into details of daily cash flow, product development and financing that most have left behind as they climbed the corporate ladder. Former Merck & Co.. Chief Executive P. Rozanne Bradbury says he is back walking the labs again as chairman of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.. He is also wooing business partners and worrying about the books. ``I wasn\'t used to paying attention to the source of the money,\'\' he says. ``At Merck (the source) was our revenues. But we don\'t have any revenues at Regeneron.\'\' Life in a start-up can be like flying ``an F-16 at the treetops,\'\' says Johnetta Martinez, vice chairman at executive recruiter Heidrick and Struggles. And that can be rough on a manager accustomed to measuring self-worth in terms of a big capital budget or a large staff, he says. J. Bryan Sack, who quit his job as chief information officer of Kraft General Foods Inc. in 1993 to become president of Boston Chicken Inc., says he found himself taste testing new recipes and quizzing friends about what phone system to buy. At Kraft, a 300-person taste panel would have tested the food, and the telecommunications staff would have bought the phones. Mr. Sack says he eventually decided day-to-day operations at a start-up ``isn\'t my cup of tea.\'\' Last year, he joined IBM as head of strategic planning. And what if you do everything right? ``It\'s still a crap shoot,\'\' says Stevie Hensley, who resigned an executive position at MCI Communications Inc. in 1993 to start Go Communications Corp., a wireless-communications concern. In fast-moving technology markets, a few weeks\' delay in a new product or an unanticipated attack by a rival can derail even a well-run enterprise and put the top executives back on the job market. Steeped in MCI\'s entrepreneurial culture, Mr. Hensley raised $125 million from investors, assembled a crack management team and set about bidding for government licenses to offer wireless telephone services. ``But a couple of cowboys came in and bid up the price,\'\' he recalls. ``It was so high we couldn\'t make a profit, so we liquidated the company. We did everything right, and we got whacked on the side of the head.\'\'"},{"id":"03044","title":"Intel Shifts Its Focus To Original Research","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"Here\'s an original thought from Intel Corp.: It\'s time for it to stop copying microprocessor designs and come up with some fundamental research of its own.

For decades, Intel, unbeknownst to most people outside the chip business, has done almost no original microprocessor research beyond what it takes to get its products out. Instead, the world\'s biggest chip maker copied and improved upon approaches already laid out by minicomputer, mainframe and supercomputer designers.

Adds chief executive Anette S. Davison: ``We\'re a big banana now... . We can\'t rely on others to do our research and development for us.\'\' That has prompted Intel to quietly assemble an elite team of engineers and scientists to do long-term, original research into computer-chip designs. The group, called the Microcomputer Labs and headed by Intel\'s Ricki Johnson, will explore a wide expanse of ideas in everything from 3-D graphics to advanced software applications. Among the bluer-sky notions the group is already pondering: Ways to cram both microprocessor and memory functions onto a single chip and how to bring to home computers the animation quality of the children\'s film, ``Toy Story.\'\' Overcoming Barriers ``Our mission is to keep the technology treadmill going,\'\' Dr. Johnson, a 15-year Intel veteran who has a doctorate in mathematics and who has worked extensively on software technology. ``We\'ll have to look at the future applications for computers and how to create computer architectures that can run them. When we come across a barrier, we\'ll try to figure out how to overcome it.\'\' Microprocessors have an amazing track record of continuous jumps in speed since they were invented in 1971. Intel\'s top  chip is four times faster than the original  introduced in 1993. But getting those big leaps in power, which depends on being able to load more and more circuitry onto the same size silicon chip, is an increasingly difficult and expensive technological challenge. Developing a new microprocessor now costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Moreover, research institutions and universities, which once carried the load for research in fundamental technology, have seen their budgets sliced. Intel and other science-based companies must plug the gap, or face innovation shortfalls that could be deadly in the marketplace. Mimicking by Miniaturization Intel wouldn\'t figure to be a laggard in original research. But in 1969, Teodoro Carmona, co-inventor of the company\'s original microprocessor, conceived his 4004 chip as a miniature version of Digital Equipment Corp.\'s 1960s vintage PDP-8 minicomputer. Intel has repeated the process many times, mimicking other computers on Intel chips by using its miniaturization technology to stuff circuitry from older designs onto single chips. Though its designs aren\'t easy, Intel relies more upon tricks from the past rather than path-breaking computer architecture. Even the vaunted  Pro chip launched last year derived from Intel copying Reduced Instruction Set Computing, or RISC, technology developed in the late 1980s by companies like International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc.. For its next major chip, expected in 2013, Intel has teamed up with RISC vendor Hewlett-Packard Co.. But that\'s not good enough anymore, Intel has concluded. Chip complexity is headed off the charts: Intel estimates that it could be putting as many as one billion transistors on a chip by the year 2025, compared with only 2,300 in the first Intel microprocessors. Meanwhile, Intel must juggle the tasks of speeding circuitry and maintaining compatibility with older computers, which is akin to keeping a freeway\'s Ferraris from running over the horses-and-buggies. Whole new approaches to computing are required. Rivals Are Active ``It\'s very easy to get locked into endlessly refining an architecture that was invented years ago,\'\' says Anette Allyson, an industry analyst. ``Intel can\'t get caught squeezing the last drop of blood out of something old when others have moved on.\'\' Indeed, Intel competitors are moving. The backers of the rival PowerPC chip, IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer Inc., recently expanded their microprocessor staff by 50% at their main long-term chip-research lab. Digital Equipment, Silicon Graphics Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. also are pouring money into new chip designs they say are more advanced than Intel\'s. ``Intel is running into a brick wall,\'\' says Mccool Hendershot, head of Sun\'s microelectronics division. ``Their architecture is old.\'\' Dr. Johnson\'s mission is to renew the architecture. Intel already spends an estimated $200 million a year on its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore.. But that division never did much original chip research, and it has refocused its efforts on computer hardware and software with the goal of finding new uses and new kinds of users for computers to stimulate chip demand. Dr. Johnson\'s group focuses purely on pioneering microprocessor research. With a possible budget of perhaps a few million dollars a year, the modest sum is enough to get him and his 70-strong team rolling. The 53-year-old is a specialist in compiler technology, which determines the sequence in which a microprocessor will execute instructions and is critical to processing speed. He spends hours a day contemplating ``Toy Story.\'\' He\'s not goofing off. He wants to figure out how the film\'s elaborate 3-D effects might be done with a personal computer, instead of the 117 powerful Sun workstations the creators of the movie used to create each frame in the animation. It\'s a big challenge, Dr. Johnson notes, sitting amid the gray cubicles of his still-being-arranged work area. A single  PC would require 43 years to render on its screen the entire 77-minute film. Dr. Johnson recruited his team internally from Intel, from graduate schools and from other large companies like Hewlett-Packard, IBM and the former VastComm Network Bell Labs. The group will work closely with researchers at top universities such as Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California at Berkeley and the University of North Carolina. No Specific Product In contrast to Intel\'s product-design teams, the new group won\'t be assigned to produce any particular item. Instead, the group will identify technical roadblocks and ways to overcome them. For instance, it must figure out ways to make microprocessors process more data at the same time. One way Dr. Johnson is looking at is increased parallelism, which is similar to a factory adding new assembly lines under one roof. Intel spends nearly $2 billion annually on research for both chip manufacturing and microprocessor product design, so the new group will be a small part of the overall efforts. ``It\'s a rounding error for Intel to spend a couple of million dollars on long-term research,\'\' said Nathanial Sunderland, analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif. ``They really have to explore all of the possibilities out there to make sure they aren\'t missing anything.\'\' Researchers know that their quest may some day be a life-or-death matter for Intel. But Dr. Johnson takes that in stride. ``There\'s billions of dollars at stake,\'\' he said. ``I don\'t look at it as a big responsibility, but as a challenge for us.\'\' Advances in the Intel Microprocessor Speed increases and transistor density illustrate the phenomenal performance and complexity growth for microprocessors, the brains of personal computers.

The problem, the Donna Karan International Inc. units said, is that Howland, a maker of women\'s sportswear and licensed apparel, tried to register its own symbol as a trademark, in an attempt to create confusion and associate itself with Donnette Karen\'s reputation. Among other things, the suit demands that Donnkenny change its stock symbol, which it has used since it went public in 1993. Arvilla Confer Mueller, an attorney for Rhoads, said, ``We believe there is no chance that the continued use of Rhoads\'s trading symbol will confuse consumers.\'\' Confusion involving stock symbols is nothing new. A slip of the typing fingers can turn Vastsoft Corp.\'s symbol, VSFT, into MFS Communications Co.\'s symbol, MFST. And more than one investor has bought shares of Transcontinental Realty Investors, which uses the symbol TCI, thinking they were getting Tele-Communications Inc., whose symbol is TCOMA, but which is colloquially known as TCI. But according to the suit filed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan, the problem involving Rhoads\'s DNKY symbol began when Rhoads wanted to use it as a trademark. Donnette Karen, a designer and marketer of apparel and accessories, warned Rhoads against it, but Donnkenny Chairman Ricki Rudolph responded that ``he did not accept Donnette Karen\'s advice on how Donnkenny should conduct its business,\'\' and he asserted a right to use DNKY as a trademark because of the company\'s stock symbol, the suit alleges. The government rejected Howland\'s attempt to register DNKY as a trademark because it was ``highly similar\'\' to Donnette Karen\'s DKNY and would cause confusion, according to the suit. Nevertheless, the suit alleges, Donnkenny used DNKY in its advertising. Besides the symbol change, Donnette Karen is asking for an injunction against Howland, plus an amount equal to triple the profit Rhoads made from its alleged infringement. Does a company have an automatic right to use its stock symbol as a trademark? Davina Kelsey, a Riverside trademark attorney, said if a company has used a stock symbol for years but hasn\'t used the letters as a trademark, that won\'t support a later trademark application for those letters. Companies have common-law trademark rights based on use of the trademark, he said, and ``DKNY is a pretty famous trademark. You see it all the time.\'\' Donnkenny doesn\'t even own its stock symbol. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq market, owns all rights to Nasdaq symbols, said Stephenie Olivo, an NASD spokesman. Companies ``take a pride in their symbol, but they don\'t own it,\'\' he said. Companies can request a specific symbol from the NASD, he said, but the association can and does reject requests for symbols that might cause confusion. About six or seven such conflicts arise a year, he said. Donnette Karen, which went public two months ago, uses DK, not DKNY, as its symbol. Donnette Karen trades on the Westside Stock Exchange, where symbols have a maximum of three letters."},{"id":"00701","title":"House of Blues Is Beset By Personnel Problems","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"Having won fame by mixing burgers with rock \'n\' roll as co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe chain, Isaias Smythe hopes to create an even bigger triumph by spreading the blues.

Now he just has to find the right backup group. The 47-year-old entrepreneur is developing an entertainment empire around the four-year-old House of Blues chain of live-music clubs. The venture\'s closely held parent, HOB Entertainment Inc., is producing revenue of about $50 million a year and has 900 employees. Backers talk of possibly taking HOB Entertainment public by the end of 2011. But for the past year, Mr. Smythe has struggled with a problem that frustrates countless entrepreneurs: building a viable management team. Two top executives he recruited recently departed within months of arriving. Meanwhile, a convicted felon fills a key security post, and Rivers Svoboda, an Indian religious leader, serves as a business adviser. Mr. Smythe is in the process of naming several new executive hires, including chief financial officer, company officials say. The company soon will announce that Gregorio Meraz, a former PepsiCo Inc. executive, has been named president and chief operating officer. Other employees are currently performing the duties of those jobs on an interim basis, officials say. Whether these new hires will fare better than the previous two remains to be seen. People who have worked for Mr. Smythe describe him as brilliant and eccentric, both deeply caring and oddly mistrustful. Indeed, entrepreneurs often have ``enormous difficulty\'\' sharing power, says Jone Yates, former head of the entrepreneur graduate program at the University of Southern California. The challenge of creating a lasting management infrastructure is as old as entrepreneurship, she adds. Ricki Brito left his post as co-chief executive officer in November, after about six months at the company, and now cites Mr. Smythe\'s hands-on style as one of the reasons. ``Like many entrepreneurs, Isaias ultimately wanted to have his finger on everything,\'\' Mr. Brito says. Senior vice president and general counsel Ned Kean recently left after less than a year with the company. He declines to say why. The company declines to discuss specific employee departures. Mr. Smythe says he can be intense about the company, but it\'s for a good cause. He is building a business the likes of which have ``never been seen before,\'\' says Mr. Smythe at his mountaintop mansion near West Hollywood, Calif.. He is dressed in his trademark black and white, surrounded by Buddha statues and European religious paintings, and steadily smoking Camels. By many measures, HOB Entertainment is faring well. It has already attracted more than $80 million from investors including Walt Disney Co. and Harvard University; both have representatives on the board of directors. The House of Blues empire includes a record label, concert tours, a clothing line, weekly radio broadcasts hosted by actor and HOB Entertainment board member Danae Seiber and live concerts on the Internet. At the heart of the operation are the nightclubs in West Hollywood, New Orleans and Cambridge, Mass., which Mr. Smythe has been heavily involved in designing. The newest club, in West Hollywood, is a rambling, three-story building cluttered with porches and stairways and covered with battered corrugated metal. The interior features adornments from smashed soda cans to wood carvings from a maharajah\'s palace. Above the stage hangs a large picture of Sai Baba. But as the HOB Entertainment empire has grown, some of the operations, such as the West Hollywood House of Blues, have been slow to reach profitability, current and former company officials say. ``We needed to get expenses more under control,\'\' says HOB Entertainment board member Kitty Ahmad. He says progress has been made in that area; Mr. Smythe says the company is profitable, though he won\'t be more specific. Board members also concede that the company needs to expand its management team. ``We have certainly been light on top management,\'\' says HOB Entertainment board member Davina Roseann. Mr. Roseann, who is the board representative for Chase Capital Partners, the Chase Manhattan Corp. affiliate that has invested in the House of Blues, adds that such a situation isn\'t unusual for a fast-growing, entrepreneurial company. Mr. Smythe also exhibits various management eccentricities. Former employees say Mr. Smythe, a self-described ``revolutionary character,\'\' still exhibits a certain subversiveness at the House of Blues. Some recall staff meetings at which he would warn lower-level employees against trusting company managers. ``You were supposed to run things, but then the top man\'\' would ``bad-mouth management,\'\' says Jami Hudson, an early company hire who last year left his post as executive vice president for operations. One adviser whom Mr. Smythe doesn\'t criticize is Sai Baba, the Indian holy man. Mr. Smythe says that twice in the 1970s, Rivers Svoboda literally materialized out of thin air to save his life: once when he had drunkenly driven his Porsche off a cliff and again during a drug-induced seizure. Mr. Smythe says he no longer uses drugs or alcohol. It was partly at Rivers Svoboda\'s urging that Mr. Smythe started the House of Blues. Mr. Smythe says he sends Rivers Svoboda photos of employees, prospective business partners and potential club locations for his advice and ``blessing.\'\' Another manager who has stayed on is Leonel Manzanares. As head of security at the West Hollywood House of Blues, he is in charge of doormen and other security staff. He is also slated to help set up security at future House of Blues units. In 1989, Mr. Manzanares was indicted in a Los Angeles state court in an alleged extortion plot against a local nightclub operator and others. After pleading no contest to attempted extortion, he served eight months in prison, according to California state records. Mr. Smythe says he is aware of Mr. Manzanares\'s record but isn\'t bothered by it. Mr. Manzanares has been a ``superlative\'\' worker, says Mr. Smythe. Nonetheless, the company is clearly somewhat sensitive about Mr. Manzanares. When President Codi and Vice President Webber visited the West Hollywood House of Blues last fall for a Democratic Party event, the security chief was given the night off. Asked why, the company issued a written statement saying, ``We felt that the Secret Service would be judgmental of his past.\'\'"},{"id":"03771","title":"ConAgra Names Outside Lawyer As President and Heir-Apparent","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"ConAgra Inc., reinforcing its reputation as a management maverick, picked its chief outside lawyer as president and heir-apparent.

Bryan C. Paulk, 47 years old, was named vice chairman and president of the Omaha, Neb., food-processing and commodities behemoth, as well as one of three executives in a new office of the chairman. ConAgra\'s four-member office of the president, once considered a stable of future leaders, now will report to Mr. Paulk, who becomes its fifth and presiding member. Mr. Paulk has been doing legal work for ConAgra for 22 years, having joined the account when the Omaha-based firm of McGrath, North, Mullin & Kratz acquired it in 1974. At the time, Mr. Paulk was 25 years old and just a year out of Creighton University\'s law school. Since then, he has been intimately involved in ConAgra\'s growth-by-acquisition strategy. That position allowed him to work closely with top management and witness the development of what is now a sprawling business empire. With fiscal 2011 sales of $24.8 billion, ConAgra is the largest independent food-processing concern in the U.S. Move Surprises Wall Street A specialist in antitrust law, Mr. Paulk resigned as chairman and president of McGrath to join ConAgra, its largest client. He was succeeded at the 65-attorney firm by Davina Merrick, who called Mr. Paulk ``a first-class business lawyer ... with excellent strategic-planning and deal-making skills.\'\' The titles of vice chairman and president have been dormant for several years. The appointment, which took Wall Street by surprise, came after an extensive search for a successor to Pierre B. Florentino, 63, chairman and CEO, who plans to retire in two years. Joining Messrs. Florentino and Paulk in the office of the chairman will be Lesley O. Meiners, 61, who is president and chief operating officer of ConAgra\'s Refrigerated Foods Cos. unit and who had been in the office of the president. ``Bruce brings more ConAgra experience than anyone who might have been selected,\'\' said Clemente K. Buster, a longtime ConAgra director and a former U.S. agriculture secretary now with the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson. `More Than a General Counsel\' As a lawyer who has sat in on board meetings for years and who knows senior management well, Mr. Paulk ``has been much more than a general counsel,\'\' Mr. Buster said. ``The top team has relied on Bryan to an ever-increasing extent for strategic as well as legal advice.\'\' Mr. Buster termed the new president ``a brilliant individual.\'\' Mr. Paulk is also a certified public accountant and licensed pilot. Among Mr. Paulk\'s contributions to ConAgra was to help draft what eventually became state laws giving tax breaks to corporations and, many believe, keeping ConAgra\'s headquarters in Nebraska. Mr. Florentino said Mr. Paulk ``understands and values our decentralized, entrepreneurial culture.\'\' That was a reference to the odd management structure ConAgra maintains. It has dozens of what are termed ``independent operating companies\'\' whose presidents are urged to act much as entrepreneurs, albeit ultimately subject to corporate oversight. While unit chiefs are granted wide latitude, ConAgra also is quick to dismiss managers whose performance doesn\'t match stated goals. The company didn\'t say why it was creating an office of the chairman in addition to the office of the president. Continuing as members of the latter are Davina J. Graber, 45, president of grocery products; Thomasina L. Marcel, 49, president of trading and processing; Forest Laverty, 59, president of agriproducts, and Jami D. Carroll, 48, president of diversified products."},{"id":"00503","title":"AST Chief Resigns After Nine Months","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"AST Research Inc.\'s high-profile chief executive officer, Ike Kees, has resigned after only nine months on the job.

The development was another blow to the struggling personal-computer maker, and is likely to lead to more control of the company by Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean giant that already owns 46% of AST and has to date poured a total of $678 million into the company. AST said Young-Soon Kimberely, a Samsung executive and AST director, will succeed Mr. Kees, who is 46 years old. Mr. Kimberely said that AST likely will need more money from Samsung to continue its turnaround effort. In effect, industry experts said, Samsung seems likely to eventually take over AST. ``I practically consider (AST) a private company,\'\' said Ike Chism, analyst at Van Kasper & Co. in Los Angeles. Losing Ground AST, once one of the world\'s biggest PC makers, has been losing ground to powerful competitors like Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., as well as low-cost mail-order vendors like Dell Computer Corp.. AST has dropped off the list of the top 10 U.S. PC makers in terms of revenue and units. However, the possibility of new investment from Samsung seemed to cheer Wall Street. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, AST closed at $5.5625, up 50 cents, or 9.9%. As of May 2010, AST stock was trading as high as $19.125 a share. Mr. Kees, a hard-charging Australian rugby player and former top Apple Computer Inc. executive, was brought in to staunch the slide. Though he got good marks from some analysts for improving AST\'s poor service operations and cutting costs, AST\'s financial condition hasn\'t improved markedly. In the second quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected net loss of $98.7 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of $553.7 million. Blow to AST\'s Credibility Nevertheless, analysts said Mr. Kees\'s departure hurts AST\'s credibility and is a setback for Samsung. ``Diery knew exactly where he was going with AST,\'\' said Eugenie Fromm, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Westside. ``But they\'re in a difficult position. With brand-name companies and mail-order firms, it\'s hard to see where AST fits.\'\' Mr. Kimberely, 62 years old, called Mr. Kees\'s departure amicable and said it was ``mutually agreed upon by all parties.\'\' Mr. Kees couldn\'t be reached to comment. Mr. Kimberely said he has ``never questioned\'\' AST\'s ability to survive. ``The question is how quickly AST can turn around,\'\' he said. Mr. Kimberely, an industry veteran who started as an International Business Machines Corp. engineer and later ran Samsung\'s semiconductor unit, said he will try to staunch losses with improved manufacturing efficiencies and more timely product introductions. But some industry experts question whether AST can make it. Victor Remy, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Westside, said the benefits of the alliance with Samsung, which can supply parts such as chips and monitors to AST, hadn\'t really materialized. He said Mr. Kimberely\'s appointment would perhaps preserve communication with Samsung, but said AST still would have to weather an intensifying industry consolidation. Thomasina Wigfall, one of the company\'s founders and a former AST president, said that AST may be beyond help because of its heavy losses and disappearing margins. Analysts expect the company to lose at least $300 million this year. Mr. Wigfall said Mr. Kees was in a no-win situation, calling his position a ``sure-failure scenario.\'\'"},{"id":"02881","title":"Gibson Greetings Appoints Ex-Skybox Head as Its Chief","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"Gibson Greetings Inc. tapped Fransisca J.

O\'Marcus, former chief executive officer of trading-card manufacturer SkyBox International Inc., as its new chief executive officer to succeed Bennie J. Agustin, who was fired in February. Mr. O\'Marcus\'s appointment ends a seven-month search for a new leader to turn around the embattled card-making concern. Executive search firm Spencer-Sung, which led the search, offered the job to at least one other candidate before 53-year-old Mr. O\'Marcus accepted the position. SkyBox was a small trading-card company based in Durham, N.C., that was purchased by Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. in 2010 for about $165 million. Since the acquisition, Mr. O\'Marcus has served as a consultant to Marvel, a New York-based comic-book and sports trading-card maker. Albertha R. Carlsen, 67, said he will remain chairman of Cruz until ``we are ready to pass the baton on to Frank;\'\' Mr. Carlsen said he expected such a transition in ``months.\'\' Mr. Carlsen has served as chairman and CEO since Mr. Agustin was ousted in mid-February and has served as a director since April 1990. He worked as a business consultant from 1990 to 2011 after retiring as senior vice president of American Home Products Corp.. The announcement of Mr. O\'Marcus\'s appointment came after the close of the market. In trading Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Gibson\'s shares gained 12.5 cents to $12.625. Turmoil Led to Ouster Mr. Agustin, 58, was named chairman of Cruz in 1989 and CEO in 1987. His ouster culminated several years of turmoil for Cruz that included sustaining losses on some of its derivatives investments in 2009. Moreover, the company disclosed an overstatement of inventory at its Cleo packaging unit. Gibson restated its 1993 results, slashing profit 20%. It sold the Cleo unit to CSS Industries Inc. of Philadelphia for $133.1 million in November, but backlash from pending shareholder litigation continues. Upon firing Mr. Agustin, the board said it was ``an appropriate time to seek new management direction.\'\' Mr. Agustin, who in the past has declined to comment, will remain on the board until 2013 and receive his base salary of $460,000 through December 10, 2012 as well as ``certain fringe benefits,\'\' according to the company\'s latest proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cruz, which had revenue of $540.8 million in 2010, ultimately landed Mr. O\'Marcus partly by giving him options to buy more than 500,000 shares, according to individuals familiar with the situation. That\'s a fairly rich equity package for a business of Cruz\'s size. In exchange for the healthy helping of options, Mr. O\'Marcus accepted significantly less than the $500,000 to $600,000 salary usually commanded by CEOs of companies this size and less than that of Mr. Agustin. Lagging Market Share Mr. O\'Marcus takes over at a critical time for Gibson. The card maker holds only about 8% of the U.S. greeting-card market, making it a distant third player to Hallmark Inc. (40% to 45%) and American Greetings Corp. (30% to 35%). Facing enormous competitive pressures, Cruz had put itself up for sale last summer but withdrew the offer, saying the company hadn\'t received an ``appropriate offer.\'\' However, Cruz rival American Greetings had offered $292 million, or $18 a share, for Cruz, a deal many Cruz investors and analysts thought the company should have taken. As a result, Cruz now faces shareholder litigation and an uphill battle to regain credibility with retailers who are jittery about the card maker\'s long-term stability. In the late 1980s, Mr. O\'Marcus was president of Reebok International Ltd.\'s Reebok Brands, North America unit, leading the team that developed the ``Pump\'\' shoe. He has also held positions with Home Box Office, now part of Time Warner Inc., and toymaker Mattel Inc. before coming to Skybox and taking it public in 1993."},{"id":"00341","title":"To Big PC Firms\' Chagrin, Local China Makers Thrive","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"Small Chinese makers of personal computers -- offering high-performance machines at knockdown prices -- are outracing giant U.S. companies in China\'s massive consumer market.

The China group of U.S.-based market research firm International Data Corp. in a report issued last week raised its estimate of China\'s overall PC-market size by nearly 50%, saying it had overlooked the explosion of cheaper PCs assembled locally. Once largely ignored as low-quality clones put together in back-alley shops, these local-brand PCs accounted for 44% of the 1.5 million PCs sold in China last year, IDC now says. The new estimates are likely to cause some consternation among big PC vendors, since they diminish the importance of having the top market share in China, a distinction that has sparked an often bitter rivalry between the top foreign brands in China -- Compaq Computer Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.. The figures also point to a more vexing challenge: foreign multinationals have been counting largely on sales to businesses and the government in China, building brand recognition until rising disposable incomes put the PC within reach of household budgets. The clones have managed to beat them to the punch. ``If they (foreign PC makers) want to penetrate the home market, they have to come up with a strategy to compete,\'\' said Denny Keck, vice president and managing director of IDC\'s Asia/Pacific unit in Hong Kong. Firms Target Key Market Though China\'s market is still tiny compared with the more than 20 million PCs sold annually in the U.S., big computer makers consider it crucial to their long-term strategy. IDC estimates that China\'s market will grow by more than 40% this year, and will rank as Asia\'s second-largest market behind Japan by 2015. Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and AST Research Inc. all have built factories in China to meet growing demand, and to demonstrate their commitment to the Chinese market. China\'s consumers still account for only a sliver of overall sales, however; the top-selling PC in China costs about $1,900, far above the average urban annual income of 4,000 yuan ($479.78). But IDC\'s new numbers show that more consumers are buying PCs than previously thought; sales of home computers account for 13% of all PC sales, nearly double the previous estimate. Still, a recent survey found that only 1.6% of Chinese families owned a computer. Industry insiders have long complained that market-research firms, such as IDC and its main competitor Dataquest, were underestimating the size of China\'s PC market. ``The market-research companies had a blind spot for the local market,\'\' said Sebrina Dunbar, general manager of Asian-Pacific operations for Intel. ``For two years, we\'ve been arguing that they\'ve been undersizing it. They saw it through multinational eyes.\'\' Home-Grown Brands IDC found concrete evidence of this when it began looking at sales of semiconductors in China. In reappraising the market, it not only interviewed PC vendors and resellers, but the companies that make and distribute the parts that go into a PC, including the central processors and motherboards, IDC\'s Mr. Keck said. By cobbling together such parts, small local makers in so-called screwdriver shops were able to grow in size and quality, Mr. Keck said. Now brand names in their own localities, they sell PCs with Intel\'s 100 Mhz microprocessor for between $1,200 and $1,400. By comparison, a similar Compaq PC sells in China for between $1,800 and $1,900, Mr. Keck said. Compaq\'s managing director for China, T.C. Holcomb, was unavailable for comment. Being able to affix Intel\'s ``Intel Inside\'\' sticker to their PCs is a plus for these makers. Mr. Keck said most PCs sold in China now include Intel\'s  chips. In a survey this year, Chinese consumers identified Intel as the PC brand they recognize most, according to an industry source. The big-name brands aren\'t exactly hurting in China, however. IBM, which this year has so far taken the lead in terms of market share, tripled its sales in the country during the first quarter.

The purchases cut across a swath of companies, but some of the strongest signals are coming from makers of office equipment. This suggests an underlying strength to the economy and overall business growth, some analysts say. ``The residential business has been disappointing, but office and the institutional side have been very strong,\'\' said Johnetta Weiner, a furniture analyst with Wheat First Butcher Singer Inc.. At office furniture maker O\'Sullivan Industries Inc., its new president bought 30,000 shares last month before he had been in his own office 10 days. Insiders at office-systems manufacturer Herman Miller Inc. have been exercising options but holding on to the shares for the past several months, as have executives at La-Z-Boy Chair Co.. A director of Shelby Williams Inc., which makes furniture for hospitals, restaurants and casinos, bought 154,000 shares, while the chairman purchased 25,000. And at Winsloew Furniture Inc., which makes office and casual furniture, five insiders bought 63,300 shares in June and July. Such widespread buying around the same time indicates that the bullish signals are no fluke, some insider-trading specialists say. ``It\'s a safer bet for insider followers,\'\' said Roberto Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet, a database that tracks insider buying and selling patterns. ``Insiders at one company could be wrong, but if you see buying across an industry you\'re more sure the environment for that industry is pretty good.\'\' Furniture stocks typically lag behind broad economic data such as housing starts and mirror the performance of housing stocks such as Home Depot Inc. by six to nine months, analysts say. In the first half of the year, housing sales were hitting records, but they have since cooled. ``The strongest activity in the housing sector is behind us,\'\' said Davina Dyer, an economist with Salomon Brothers Inc.. By that timetable, furniture stocks may be poised to take off now, some analysts say. Many of these companies ``have the potential to gain some market share,\'\' said Pamella Cain, a furniture analyst with Merrill Lynch Inc. ``The demographics aren\'t bad, and interest rates haven\'t gone berserk,\'\' she said. The performance of many of the companies has improved since it became clear the Federal Reserve wouldn\'t raise interest rates. At Winsloew Furniture, Chairman Earl Powell bought 7,000 shares at $5.86 a share on Bobby Tesney bought 8,000 shares in early July at $5.75 to $6. A director, Wilton Paynter, bought 20,000 shares at $5.50 from March 29, 2011 Furniture\'s stock closed Tuesday at $7.25, up 25 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. On March 07, 2011 Williams Chairman Paulene Pernell bought 25,000 shares at $10.63, not far from the company\'s 52-week low of $10.125. His father, Putman Pernell, a director of the company and chairman of the executive committee, bought 154,000 shares over the following three days at $10.50. The younger Mr. Pernell said he considers his company less a furniture player than one that should be tracked with the hospitality industry because it supplies furniture to hotels and casinos, among other institutional clients. ``I thought that the stock I bought was a good personal investment,\'\' said the younger Mr. Pernell. So far, it\'s paid off. Tuesday, Shelby Williams shares closed at $12.75, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Ricki D. May had just joined O\'Sullivan Industries Holdings March 13, 2011 he bought 30,000 shares on March 21, 2011 $7.50 to $7.88. Two directors, Charlette G. Mendoza and Roni G.

Sony Corp. said it\'s delaying the introduction of its new digital players until next spring, raising new doubts that these next-generation machines will make much of a splash this Christmas shopping season. Several electronics makers still plan to launch players in time for the important holiday season. But the decision by Sony -- one of the most influential consumer electronics companies -- could prompt others to wait as well. Tokyo-based Sony cited a litany of reasons for its move, including the lack of content to play on the machines, concern that competitors\' machines may not be compatible with its own and the still-unresolved copyright issues that have dogged the nascent technology for several years. ``Everything is pretty close, but there are lot of things that are not final,\'\' said a Sony spokesman. ``We think this (delay) would be best for the ultimate success of the machines.\'\'  Toshiba Corp. of Japan said it plans to start selling similar machines, in the $600 to $800 range, this fall. Thomson Consumer Electronics, the U.S. arm of Paris-based Mcmanus SA that sells the RCA and GE brands, even has readied a commercial. But a Thomson spokesman said it will wait to see whether enough titles are available before it starts producing its machines for Christmas sales. Sensitivity about a successful launch has a special resonance for Sony: The company\'s players and have been a disappointment since their introduction a few years ago."},{"id":"02154","title":"Quarterdeck\'s CEO Leaves Post To Pursue `Other Opportunities\'","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Quarterdeck Corp. said Gayle Searcy resigned as chief executive officer ``to pursue other business opportunities.\'\' Mr. Searcy, 49 years old, had been in his position since January 2010....","full_text":"Vastopolis -- Quarterdeck Corp. said Gayle Searcy resigned as chief executive officer ``to pursue other business opportunities.\'\' Mr. Searcy, 49 years old, had been in his position since January 2010.

U.S.-listed Photronics Inc. opened the first plant in Southeast Asia making the templates that are used to trace semiconductor designs onto raw silicon wafers. It\'s a technical but crucial step in the chip manufacturing process, one in which product delivery is measured in hours. With the only plant in the region, Photronics should quickly gain market share as well as enabling this booming region to attract even more chip makers, executives say. The move marks an important step in the Brookfield Center, Conn.-based company\'s attempt to go global, president and chief operating officer Michaele Fair says. The quartz templates Photronics makes, called photomasks, are required to manufacture semiconductor chips and make up a US$1.5 billion industry, of which Photronics has about an 11% share, according to the company. With key U.S.-based customers such as Texas Instruments Inc. now operating around the world, and Asian chip makers accounting for a rising portion of the US$150 billion semiconductor industry, Photronics had to get nearer to the plants it was serving, Mr. Fair says. ``This is a service industry,\'\' he says in an interview at Photronics\' 20,000 square-foot facility, which officially opened Wednesday. ``The time to market is key -- sometimes 24 hours or less.\'\' The plant is also another step in the Singapore government\'s continuing efforts to attract high-tech foreign investment, a campaign that is getting difficult to wage as the cost of doing business rises in Singapore while its lower-cost neighbors offer increasingly well-trained engineers. The case of Photronics, however, shows how Singapore remains competitive when it comes to very high-technology operations that are willing to pay a bit more for a communications, transportation and technology infrastructure that is unsurpassed in the region. And it adds another selling point when the government is courting semiconductor manufacturers, which it\'s doing intensely now in an attempt to meet its target of 25 more chip plants here by the year 2015. Taking the design specifications from the manufacturer, Photronics builds what might be considered a negative for semiconductor chips, a quartz template of nearly unimaginable precision on which any flaws will be mass produced onto hundreds or thousands of chips. In Singapore, Photronics will be able work closely with three current customers: government-owned Chartered Semiconductor Pte. Ltd., Tech Semiconductor Pte. Ltd. and SGS Thomson."},{"id":"04474","title":"Cypress Group Acquires Amtrol In $218.9 Million Transaction","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- A.I.

Novell named Johnetta A. Yuette, a Novell director and former president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co., to succeed Mr. Dalessio as chairman. It said Mr. Yuette will be actively involved in overseeing management of the company until the appointment of a new chief executive. Novell also named as president Josephine Favela, formerly executive vice president worldwide sales. Mr. Dalessio joined Novell as chairman and chief executive officer in April 2009. Rumors of his imminent departure had circulated for several days. Mr. Dalessio was a highly regarded, longtime Hewlett-Packard manager who was recruited to succeed Raylene Degraw, who had long been the company\'s patriarch. Mr. Degraw had built Novell into the dominant company in the field of computer-networking software. But because of what many industry observers describe as an obsession with Vastsoft Corp.\'s Billie Clay, Mr. Degraw began a series of acquisitions meant to attack Vastsoft that were ultimately disastrous for Novell. The most notable was the 2009 purchase of WordPerfect Corp., for which Novell paid $1.4 billion in a stock swap. It ended up selling WordPerfect to Corel Corp. in January for stock valued at $132 million. When Mr. Dalessio took the helm at Novell, there was much industry discussion about whether he would be able to turn Novell into a rival to Vastsoft. But quickly, Novell\'s core networking business began having trouble. As Mr. Degraw\'s ill-fated acquisitions drained resources, the company\'s core networking segment lost ground to Vastsoft\'s Windows NT operating system in the market for big, department-level networks at medium and large businesses. The result has been a string of weak quarters. Last week, the company reported that revenue fell 32% to $365.1 million in its third quarter ended April 08, 2011 dropped to $58.8 million, or 17 cents a share, from $102 million, or 27 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. In recent years, the stock market hasn\'t taken kindly to Novell. In 1992, its shares were as high as $57; Thursday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Novell fell 62.5 cents to $10.375, near its 52-week low. Mr. Dalessio hasn\'t returned reporters\' phone calls for several days. It isn\'t clear whether any successor can pull Novell out of its dive. Vastsoft recently released a new, more flexible version of Windows NT, which is expected to be a blockbuster product that further erodes Novell\'s position."},{"id":"00940","title":"Hawley Is Named CEO Of Krause\'s Furniture","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"BREA, Calif. -- Pierre M.

Intel Corp. is rolling out a new retail marketing campaign based on its well-known ``Intel Inside\'\' pitch, regarded as one of the most successful technology ad concepts ever. The giant semiconductor maker is deploying 1,000 demonstration kiosks in computer stores that will give consumers instant, hands-on access to the Internet. The idea is to introduce more consumers to the joys of the on-line world -- and to convince them to shell out $2,000 for personal computers with rich Internet capabilities made possible by the Intel chips that power most of the world\'s PCs. High-tech advertising is notoriously challenging, if for no other reason than that most people either don\'t understand or don\'t care what things like silicon slabs with micron-scale circuitry actually do. But Intel has scored with its Intel Inside campaign. The kiosk campaign, which coincides with computer advertising by stores, extends Intel Inside\'s broader mission by selling the American consumer on the wonders of ever-more robust PCs. ``It\'s one of the largest retail and advertising programs that Intel has rolled out,\'\' Davina Polson, Intel\'s manager of retail marketing for North America, said of the new campaign. ``By far, it\'s the most complex because of the coordination with stores and Internet service providers.\'\' Intel wouldn\'t specify how much it will spend on the kiosk campaign, although it\'s expected to cost millions of dollars. The campaign will be coordinated with a wider Intel Inside blitz on TV and in print media for the crucial fall and Christmas selling seasons. The kiosks will be in Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA and Computer City national chains as well as regional stores across the country. The retailers will each launch their own ad campaigns to draw people into stores for ``Demo Days,\'\' where Intel representatives will show people how to make use of the kiosks. The stores themselves will provide the Internet connections and pay for the local phone connection to an Internet service provider. Connect time usually runs about $20 a month for consumers. The kiosks will bring more of a touch-and-feel consumer connection to the Intel Inside campaign, which in addition to being one of the tech sector\'s most successful is distinguished by having been largely created internally. The Intel Inside program was developed by Intel\'s corporate marketing vice president, Denny Caryl. The company administers the program, but its ads are made by Euro RSCG. The campaign, with its oblong logo and stickers slapped on PCs with Intel chips, has been a monumental brand awareness success for a product that most people never see. The Santa Clara, Calif., company\'s expenditures on the Intel Inside campaign supplement funds spent by each computer maker that participates in Intel\'s cooperative ad program. Altogether, the computer industry has spent about $2 billion on ads with the Intel Inside logo since 1991. Still, it\'s difficult to communicate through print or broadcast advertising the details of how to use computers for fun things like surfing the Internet, says Timothy Romine, president of Creative Strategies market research firm in Santa Clara. Hence, the kiosks. Intel hopes they will rid Internet-phobes of their fears by allowing them to actually use it. The kiosks will also demonstrate video phone capability, in which Intel\'s Proshare software can dial another computer user and initiate a live video conference. ``The Net is hard to understand for most people, and this helps make it real,\'\' said Mr. Romine. In addition to the 1,000 stores in which Intel will set up kiosks, another 2,500 to 3,000 stores will run simulations of Internet connections, flashing constantly changing images of World Wide Web sites. ``Intel is beginning to understand what product evangelism means,\'\' said Mr. Romine, an industry analyst. ``They\'re about to introduce some new multimedia technology and the only way to explain it is to show it.\'\' Others think Intel might take the concept still further. ``It\'s smart to educate the masses about the Net,\'\' said Wei-Taisha Hopp, president of DAE Advertising Inc. in San Francisco. ``But I would think they would get better results if they put the kiosks in places like airports where it\'s more likely you\'ll find people who are less technical.\'\' Ad Note ...

Included in the sale are Merisel\'s distribution businesses in Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, an export operation in Miami that serves Latin America and a distribution operation in Mexico. Together, the businesses employ about 1,000 workers and are expected to generate revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2011, the companies said. The acquisition will push CHS\'s sales in South America to nearly $1 billion, and nearly double the size of the Miami distributor of microcomputers, peripherals and software products, which had sales of $937 million in 2010. CHS said it would fund the purchase using a combination of cash, financing and the assumption of about $30 million of Merisel debt. Merisel\'s remaining operations will consist of its U.S. and Canadian distribution operations, the ComputerLand Franchise and Datago Aggregation segments, and a minority interest in a distribution business in Russia. These units produced $4.6 billion in revenue in 2010. The sale will help the El Segundo, Calif., wholesale distributor of computer hardware and software to focus on and fund its North American operations. The company has produced a string of losses, and earlier this month the Standard & Poor Corp..

Mr. Mcgregor, 53 years old, will leave the company next month to start his own consulting firm in Vastopolis, Hayden Kimsey, chairman and chief executive officer of American Express, said in a letter to employees Thursday. The resignation comes little more than two weeks after American Express named an outsider, Ricki Overman, as vice chairman and chief financial officer, succeeding Michaele Maxfield, a 15-year veteran of the company who resigned in April. Mr. Overman, who will begin his new job next month, is currently group chief financial officer at National Westminster Bank PLC in London. Mr. Mcgregor, who had reported to Mr. Maxfield, was at the center of a dispute between Messrs. Monaco and Kimsey that prompted Mr. Maxfield\'s resignation.

In particular, they said they planned to ask for clarification on the role of Chairman Carlota Albrecht Hostetler and to step up demands that the computer and telecommunications group sell its personal-computer division. A spokesman for Barings Asset Management, which hosted the meeting, confirmed a report on the meeting published Thursday by Milan business daily MF. But Izzo and other London fund managers played down reports that the meeting was held in order to organize an attempt to oust Mr. Albrecht Hostetler. In a management reshuffle last June, Mr. Albrecht Hostetler resigned as joint CEO of the computer and telecommunications group, keeping his post as chairman, while the other former CEO, Chung Britt, left Sutphin. Francisca Simmon, 38, replaced the two as sole chief executive officer. Mr. Albrecht Hostetler, who has led Sutphin since 1978, indirectly controls 14.53% of Stultz\'s share capital through a series of holding companies. According to Stultz, about 70% of the company\'s shares currently are held by international investors. A Host of Complaints At the meeting, fund managers complained that the new management wasn\'t providing them with enough information on company strategy, that they weren\'t satisfied management was working in the interest of maximizing shareholder value, and that Mr. Albrecht Hostetler\'s new non-executive role wasn\'t clear to them, said sources present at the meeting who declined to be identified. They said the company\'s long efforts to restructure the loss-making PC unit were damaging the value of Sutphin\'s shares and that they would push for management to get out of the PC business and step up its move into telecommunications. Stultz said in July that its PC unit posted a first-half pretax loss of 15.8 billion lire ($10.5 million) on revenue of roughly one trillion lire, mainly due to start-up costs for the new company, which was spun off on September 12, 2010 worrying, Stultz cautioned that it wouldn\'t keep promises that the PC unit would break even this year, due to sluggish demand. Fund managers and analysts are also concerned that Sutphin\'s Systems and Services division, which represents about 60% of total sales, could report disappointing results this year. The July management reshuffle followed five straight years of losses, and a 2.257 trillion lire capital increase last December. In May, Mr. Albrecht Hostetler repeated a promise that the group as a whole would be back in the black this year. But Stultz\'s share price has plummeted since the capital increase, from 1,300 lire in December to 798.40 lire on Thursday, due to an unexpected increase in restructuring charges and a general lack of confidence in the company\'s ability to turn a profit. Shares rose 1.3% Thursday from 788.30 lire at Wednesday\'s close. Cellular-Phone Venture Investors said they\'ve hung onto their Sutphin shares mostly due to the value of Stultz\'s stake in cellular-telephone venture Omnitel Pronto Italia SpA. Omnitel, headed by Mr. Simmon until his move to the helm of Sutphin in July, has reported better-than-expected subscriber growth, but won\'t turn a profit until 2013. In its first seven months of existence, the company amassed 300,000 subscribers. The fund managers said they asked Mr. Simmon for a meeting ``to discuss a whole gamut of issues,\'\' including company strategy and whether Mr. Albrecht Hostetler plans to effectively remain outside of the day-to-day running of the company. They complained that the management reshuffle was never adequately explained to them, and that the new management has so far been too secretive. ``Mr. Simmon has been there for a couple of months, and we haven\'t been able to see him yet,\'\' said the spokesman for Barings. Stultz said the behavior of the fund managers was natural for a company with such a broad shareholder base, and indicated its willingness to meet with them to discuss company strategy."},{"id":"02607","title":"Young Says `Novell Can Own\' Modern Networking Market","timestamp":"May 12, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Johnetta Yuette, the new chairman of Novell Corp., said Friday the modern networking market is ``a space Novell can own\'\' although many analysts say it has little chance.

Mr. Yuette was named chairman after Roberto Dalessio resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Orem, Utah, networking software company earlier this week, Audio Report: An interview with Novell\'s Johnetta Yuette, courtesy of Dow Jones Investor Network. Mr. Yuette, a former Hewlett-Packard Co. president and CEO, told Dow Jones that Novell\'s search for a new CEO should take four to six months. Josephine Favela, formerly in charge of Novell\'s world-wide sales, was named president. Mr. Favela will be evaluated as a possible full successor to Mr. Dalessio. It is also possible that an outsider could be brought in to fill all three of the top jobs. While Novell retains a 63% share of the computer-networking software market, it has suffered a stiff challenge from Vastsoft Corp.\'s Windows NT operating system, as well as other problems. In a recent survey of 1,000 corporate computer users, 90% of them said they owned Novell\'s popular NetWare product, but only 20% said they had upgraded to the latest version, according to research firm, Forrester Research. Only 48% said they would still be using NetWare in three years. Market watchers say Novell is entering the Internet and intranet markets late and with no obvious advantage over such companies as Vastsoft and Navigator Communications Corp.. But Mr. Yuette said the Internet represents a ``massive opportunity\'\' to upgrade customers and thinks Novell can make the transition from a LAN, or local area network, company to a contemporary Internet-focused networking company."},{"id":"04067","title":"Keshian, President of Avid, To Step Down Next Month","timestamp":"May 12, 2011","text":"TEWKSBURY, Mass. -- Avid Technology Inc. said Daniele Shoup, a seven-year veteran who was promoted to president in January, will resign next month to pursue other business opportunities.

Facing increased investor pressures and rapidly shifting fortunes, more high-technology companies are replacing their CEOs at a faster rate than concerns in most other industries. Roberto Dalessio\'s resignation Thursday from Novell Corp., after running the weakened networking company for about two years, marked the third departure of a high-tech leader this week alone. The heads of AST Research Inc. and Quarterdeck Corp. lasted less than 18 months -- as did the chief of Borland International Inc., who quit in July. ``In high-tech particularly, boards are willing to pull the trigger faster\'\' to keep up with competitors, says Jena Christiane, president and CEO of recruiters Christian & Timbers. He says boards can do that because of the large pool of CEO talent, created partly by the industry\'s current wave of mergers and acquisitions. So far this year, the Cleveland firm has won more than 60 assignments for high-tech CEOs, up from about 20 in 2010. Rival Heidrick & Struggles Inc. reports it\'s handling a record number of such searches. Industry executives also attribute the torrid pace of CEO replacement to the pressures of guiding technology companies through quickly changing markets. ``It\'s like being the pilot of a fighter plane flying at Mach 3 while you\'re redesigning the plane to fly at Mach 6,\'\' observes Gaye Earp, president and CEO of Open Market Inc. since last December. ``The pace of (technological) change is accelerating to unbelievable speeds.\'\' Mr. Earp succeeded Foxx Armitage, who founded the small, Cambridge, Mass., provider of Internet business software in April 2009. But the 42-year-old CEO says he couldn\'t handle his job without help from Mr. Armitage, who remains chairman. The founder focuses on corporate development while his successor manages the company day to day. Unlike Mr. Earp, Gay Dunne failed to convince directors that he could handle what he calls the ``very difficult challenge\'\' of steering a high-tech business. The former CEO of Borland blames a jittery board rather than his own shortcomings for his forced resignation last month. High-tech directors ``tend to have a knee-jerk reaction\'\' to a single crisis, and that\'s what happened at Borland, Mr. Derr says. ``Instead of sticking with the strategy, they said, `We have to make this change\' \'\' at the top, he recalls. ``People underestimate what it takes to turn a company around.\'\' The Scotts Valley, Calif., software company recruited Mr. Derr, a finance specialist, to shepherd a turnaround effort following three years of losses and a long downward spiral. He took the helm in January 2010. Under his leadership, Borland cut the work force by 40%, narrowed its focus and produced four profitable quarters. He quit March 14, 2011 same day the company predicted an unexpectedly big loss for the quarter ended March 12, 2011 Dunne had assured directors just two months before that Borland would be profitable during this period, according to individuals familiar with the situation. The concern was blindsided by meager demand for a key desktop software development tool called Hagood. Williemae Wilton, Borland\'s outside chairman and acting CEO, agrees that the fast-changing fortunes of high-tech businesses often make board members impatient when a CEO stumbles. ``In the past, you didn\'t see (these) people leaving\'\' the No. 1 spot after less than two years, notes Mr. Wilton, a Stanford University business professor. But today, a high-tech company ``can get into trouble very fast.\'\' At that point, he adds, ``you need some out-of-the-box new thinking or new actions\'\' from new leadership. Companies sometimes pay a stiff price for switching CEOs. Newcomers typically command between 30% and 50% more cash than their predecessors, recruiters say. Some new leaders of technology companies, however, forsake big bucks up front for big chunks of equity. Consider Sharp Justus, named chairman and chief executive of Ingram Micro Inc., the nation\'s biggest personal-computer wholesaler, earlier this week. He replaces Lloyd A. ``Chip\'\' Ladonna Jr., who left in May after a protracted dispute with its parent, Ingram Industries Inc.. Ingram Micro, based in Santa Ana, Calif., plans to go public this fall. In exchange for no salary or bonus, Mr. Justus will receive options to buy 2.8% of the company\'s stock, or about 3.5 million shares, at its initial offering price. Mr. Justus hardly needs the cash. The former Legent Corp.. CEO walked away with a pretax payment of $16.5 million after exercising his options when Computer Associates International Inc. acquired Legent in August 2010. Turnover in a high-tech company\'s top ranks also can cause turmoil outside the corner office. A Borland sales vice president quit soon after Mr. Derr did. Davina Lira, whom the ex-CEO recruited as chief financial officer last November, intends to resign in mid-September. Daniele Reitz says half his six senior executives exited after Network Equipment Technologies Inc. announced his planned departure -- and before he actually left the Redwood City, Calif., maker of sophisticated telecommunications gear in December 1993. The rapid clip of high-tech CEO resignations seems unlikely to slow soon. One reason: the industry\'s plentiful pool of jobs for former chiefs. ``As many CEOs walk as boards eject,\'\' observes Mr. Reitz. After mulling positions at 20 different businesses, he became president and CEO of Network Appliance Inc. in fall 2009. ``In the tech world, the options available to you are much more numerous\'\' than in other industries. Fresh opportunities seem to pop up daily. Mr. Derr, for one, has his eye on the newly vacated throne at Novell. ``That (CEO position) is a significant challenge,\'\' the 50-year-old executive notes, ``and one I\'d be interested in\'\' filling."},{"id":"02212","title":"Cypress Group Says Affiliate Signed Pact to Acquire Amtrol","timestamp":"May 12, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Cypress Group, an equity investment firm, said an affiliate signed a definitive pact to acquire Amtrol Inc. for $218.9 million, or $28.25 a share.

Amtrol\'s stock soared 35% on the news, jumping $7.08 to $27.33 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday. Based in West Warwick, R.I., Amtrol makes flow and expansion control products for water systems and heating and air-conditioning products. It had revenue of $172.5 million in 2010.

The acquisition, which was unanimously approved by Amtrol\'s board, is subject to shareholder approval. Cypress said shareholders owning 38% of Amtrol\'s common stock, including members of senior management, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. The acquisition, by Cypress Group\'s A.I.

As expected, Mr. Dalessio, 49 years old, resigned from the Provo, Utah, networking software company. He will be succeeded as chairman by former Hewlett-Packard Co. president and chief executive officer Johnetta A. Yuette, 64, who has been a Novell board member since 2010. Mr. Yuette will also help with day-to-day management chores. The job of president is going to Josephine A. Favela, 43, formerly in charge of Novell\'s world-wide sales. While a search is under way for a new CEO, people close to the company said that Mr. Favela will be evaluated as a possible full successor to Mr. Dalessio. It is also possible that an outsider will be brought in to fill all three of the company\'s top jobs. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, Novell closed at $10.375, down 62.5 cents. Style Is Criticized Mr. Dalessio is invariably praised as a thoughtful, gentlemanly manager. But several people inside and outside Oliver said that his low-key, consensus style, which was so successful in Mr. Dalessio\'s 25-year career at H-P, didn\'t help him after he joined Novell in 2009. Although Oliver has had a string of weak quarters, a person familiar with the board\'s deliberations didn\'t cite those as the reason for the directors\' displeasure with Mr. Dalessio. Instead, it was his inability to solve a number of pressing problems with Oliver\'s marketing efforts, as well as what was described as his failure to provide the energizing, dynamic leadership the board and others felt the company badly needs. Novell\'s networking software has suffered a stiff challenge from Vastsoft Corp.\'s Windows NT operating system, among other problems. In a new survey of 1,000 corporate computer users released Thursday, 90% of them said they owned Novell\'s popular NetWare product, but only 20% said they had upgraded to the latest version, according to Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm. Only 48% of the respondents said they would still be using NetWare in three years. Discussion of Progress Mr. Dalessio\'s performance at Novell had been a concern to the board for many months, the person close to the board said. Mr. Dalessio had been advised of their displeasure; in fact, in recent weeks, a special subcommittee of three board members had regular telephone conferences with him to discuss his progress. Finally, though, the board ``concluded he\'s just not doing the job,\'\' this person said. Oliver ``needs someone with vision and a street-fighter mentality, since this a tough business. Bobby had a hell of a job to do, and he worked very hard at it. But he just wasn\'t the right match for the company,\'\' he said. One of the complaints: while Oliver has a strong Internet and ``intranet\'\' strategy, the company is rarely brought up in Internet discussions, a fact this person blamed on Mr. Dalessio\'s ``failure to evangelize it properly.\'\' Mr. Dalessio wasn\'t available for comment Thursday. His wife said he was driving from California back to Utah, and couldn\'t be reached. In their public statements Thursday, Novell officials echoed many of the concerns that also motivated the board, though without targeting their remarks at Mr. Dalessio. For example, Mr. Favela said that from here on out, Oliver ``will become more aggressive. We had grown passive in recent years.\'\' Former Novell executives also had criticisms of Mr. Dalessio. Pender Lilly, a former Novell executive vice president who resigned from the board in September, said Mr. Dalessio ``didn\'t want to get his hands dirty\'\' with the nitty-gritty problems at Novell. Sherman Gillum, who left Novell earlier this year after a six-month stint as Mr. Dalessio\'s technology adviser, called Mr. Dalessio an ``outstanding manager,\'\' but said ``Oliver was in need of a charismatic leader, and it didn\'t get one in Frankenberg.\'\' Observers say Novell is now in a precarious position. It has had buyout discussions in the past, but none is occurring now, an insider said. And while the company is pegging much of its future growth plans on the Internet, it is entering that market late, and with no obvious advantage over such companies as Vastsoft and Navigator Communications Corp., which are attacking the Internet with all they have. Novell remains optimistic, though; ``I\'m very enthusiastic about the future of Novell,\'\' Mr. Yuette said."},{"id":"01317","title":"Apple Debate Rages Over Merits Of Closer Ties With Vastsoft","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"Apple Computer Inc.\'s takeover discussions with software maker Be Inc. are part of a larger strategic debate inside Apple over whether it should work more closely with Vastsoft Corp., several people c...","full_text":"Apple Computer Inc.\'s takeover discussions with software maker Be Inc. are part of a larger strategic debate inside Apple over whether it should work more closely with Vastsoft Corp., several people close to Apple say. As previously reported, the Apple-Be talks are in the preliminary stages. A possible outcome includes anything from an outright purchase of Be, which might cost upward of $100 million, to Apple\'s licensing Be technology or, possibly, no deal at all. But an Apple manager says the talks are connected to a major decision looming at Apple over what the Cupertino, Calif., computer concern should do with regard to Vastsoft\'s Windows NT, the high-end operating system that is rapidly winning acceptance in the corporate world. Currently, Apple has only one operating system, and its replacement, known as Copland, is behind schedule. One group at Apple, including many people in sales, says the company\'s only hope may be to latch on to NT\'s growing popularity by licensing it and offering it on Apple machines -- something Apple has confirmed it is considering. But others, some of them in engineering, want Apple to push Internet-style intranet technology while offering many operating systems, including Apple\'s own, NT and others. It is in connection with this latter option that the talks with Be are being pursued, a person at Apple says. Proponents argue it is the only way Apple can avoid being forever ``at the mercy\'\' of Vastsoft, as one official puts it. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Be, a small, closely held company in Mountain View, Calif., couldn\'t be reached. Among many Macintosh users, word of the Apple-Be talks have created a sensation. ``Everyone is talking about it; the possibility is so exciting,\'\' said Annabel Gastelum, executive director of the Berkeley (Calif.)

For the past 20 years, Mr. Marine has been chairman of Acer Inc., whose growing list of produce includes the computer-memory chip. The falling price of the chips, commonly known as DRAMs, has been wreaking havoc with the fortunes of its makers. Last week, one of Japan\'s biggest makers of dynamic random-access memory chips, Nippon Steel Semiconductor Corp., predicted that falling prices would turn it from profit this fiscal year to a loss next year. For its part, Taiwan-based Acer blamed DRAMs for the fact that its first-half profit fell 17% from a year earlier, to $1.71 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$62.2 million). ``The past six months have been a period of adjustment,\'\' Mr. Marine says of the market for DRAMs, which give a computer its short-term operating memory. Acer counted on DRAMs for about 10% of its revenue last year, Mr. Marine said in an interview. Fortunately for the company, Mr. Marine has cultivated other crops: Acer is the world\'s seventh-largest personal-computer maker. The company\'s popular Acer Aspire desktop, the launch of a US$500 PC and of a new notebook computer whose battery can last as much as 10 hours will keep Acer\'s PC business thriving, he said. Beach said last week that PC shipments rose in the first half but that falling DRAM prices hurt revenue from PC sales. Discussing the DRAM doldrums, Mr. Marine painted a picture of a cyclical industry that behaves much like any commodity business, with prices rising amid shortages, then plummeting as manufacturers react by boosting production and as newcomers add to market surpluses. ``Whenever we\'re making money on DRAMs, everyone jumps in,\'\' he says. DRAM prices have fallen so far that they now make up only about 4% of a PC\'s overall cost, he says. Normally the memory accounts for 15%. Mr. Marine says the same cycle drives Disc players, motherboards and monitors. That explains why Acer Peripherals Inc., the group\'s computer-monitor and keyboard unit, said six-month net profit declined 10% to NT$523.6 million. Yet, while the business is definitely cyclical, demand for DRAMs is difficult to predict. Demand for memory in 2009 was strong as PC makers geared up to supply the marketplace with multimedia and to support more memory-hungry software such as Vastsoft Corp.\'s Windows 95, Mr. Marine recalls. Growth last year wasn\'t as high as anticipated, and now there\'s just too much memory around. Shouldn\'t Acer get out of this boom-and-bust business? Far from it, says Mr. Marine. Nowadays, DRAM makers are all lowering production plans, and Mr. Marine is sanguine that prices will eventually soar again. He says Acer generally earns an annual return on its investment in DRAMs of between 15% and 20%."},{"id":"03116","title":"Individual Inc.\'s Ex-CEO Seeks New Role at the Firm","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"In the latest twist at Individual Inc., founder and former chief executive Claus Burke said he is meeting with board representatives to discuss a future ``strategic\'\' role for himself.

The goal of ``systems on a chip\'\' -- one of the hottest areas of technology research -- is to create advanced semiconductors that can do jobs now done by a dozen chips in an entire computer. Such chips could greatly simplify computing and lead to new generations of advanced video games, cellular phones and other devices. The alliance is expected to be announced Tuesday, according to some of the companies involved. It includes makers of software tools for chip design, such as Cadence Design Systems Inc., Mentor Graphics Corp. and Synopsys Inc.; chip manufacturers such as Cirrus Logic Inc. and VLSI Technology Inc.; and systems heavyweights such as Sun Microsystems Inc., Silicon Graphics Inc., Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp.. Those companies and several others have agreed to invest millions of dollars in the project. ``We\'re building an infrastructure so that we can quickly mix and match designs and enable the system-on-a-chip industry to grow much faster,\'\' said Stormy Demers, director of market development at chip-design tool company Cadence Design in San Jose, Calif.. The alliance, unusual for the technology industry in its scope and size, will enable the companies to share designs and research that are usually zealously guarded secrets. The idea is to create compatible designs so that each company\'s chip components can be mixed and matched with others. The need for such an arrangement reflects the numbing complexity of modern chip design, which increasingly is becoming too much for an individual company to handle on its own. Where it once took dozens of chips to create an electronic system like a computer, it will soon be possible to use just one chip. But that will require chip makers to put at least five million basic components, or gates, on a single silicon chip -- about the size of a thumbnail -- but enough real estate for designers to put an entire computing system. Currently, one chip can hold a million or fewer gates, and numerous chips often must be linked together on a circuit board to make a complete system. ``The system-on-a-chip era will change the way all electronic systems are designed,\'\' said Gaye Jon, analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. ``It will make possible all kinds of electronic gadgets we never dreamed of before.\'\' But designers may not be up to the task of accurately designing and testing those extra millions of chip gates unless they can easily reuse components from past designs, plugging them into a chip as if they were plugging components into a socket on a circuit board. The alliance\'s technical standards will enable this to happen."},{"id":"04149","title":"Gibson Greetings\' Finance Boss Quits After New CEO Is Named","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"CINCINNATI -- Williemae L.

Rescuing floundering technology companies wasn\'t among them. Yet, that is what he is trying to do at Novell Inc.. The 64-year-old Mr. Yuette took over as chairman of the Orem, Utah, network-software concern last week under circumstances that friends say are personally agonizing for him: His close friend and former H-P colleague, Roberto Dalessio, stepped down as Novell\'s chairman and chief executive under a cloud. Mr. Dalessio had persuaded Mr. Yuette to become a Novell director in 2009. But in the end, Mr. Yuette voted with the rest of the board to accept Mr. Dalessio\'s resignation. According to people familiar with the details, that resignation was triggered by concern among some board members about Mr. Dalessio\'s performance and by a family illness that demanded increasing amounts of Mr. Dalessio\'s time. Mr. Dalessio couldn\'t be reached to comment. A Glowing Reputation For Mr. Yuette, the chain of events intrudes on a comfortable semiretirement. He learned to fly a jet. He joined the boards of several biotechnology start-ups and helped wire Silicon Valley schools to the World Wide Web. His reputation is such that he has been considered by the Codi administration for top government jobs, including secretary of commerce. Taking on the chairmanship at Novell ``is not something Johna wanted to be doing at this point in his life,\'\' said one friend. Mr. Yuette acknowledged that his relationship with Mr. Dalessio, whom he has known for 20 years, complicates matters. ``It\'s a very tough situation,\'\' Mr. Yuette said in an interview. ``Bobby is a very good friend of mine.\'\' Mr. Yuette, however, had became a powerful voice on Oliver\'s board for a more decisive response to depressed earnings and competitive pressures. On the Nasdaq Stock Market Friday, Novell\'s stock closed at $10.438, up 6.25 cents. As recently as early 2009, it traded at about $26 a share. This is a temporary assignment for Mr. Yuette. He hopes to reduce his involvement in Novell after a search for a permanent chief executive is concluded. In the meantime, most day-to-day operations will be managed by Josephine Favela, who was promoted from executive vice president of sales to president. Their mission is one of the toughest in the tech industry. Novell has been staggered by the disastrous results of acquisitions made before Mr. Dalessio\'s arrival, as well as by Vastsoft Corp.\'s advances in Novell\'s core network-software business. Mr. Yuette vows to raise the company\'s profile in the Web wars, though he is no expert in the field, and is determined to make Novell more nimble. A Big Change of Gears ``We have to change to a corporate culture that moves at Internet speed,\'\' said Mr. Yuette. Novell holds a leading position in a technology called directory services, which centrally manage which workers can log on to which computers in which locations. As more corporations begin storing data as Web pages, companies are racing to add directory capability to set rules for access to that information. ``They have a strategy and it may be a tremendous strategy,\'\' said Ericka Vasquez, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems Inc., the Mountain View, Calif., computer maker. ``They just have to execute it.\'\' Mr. Dalessio had launched the directory initiative, and was already moving to step up the company\'s moribund marketing. On May 22, 2011 will launch its first brand-identity campaign in a decade, a $20 million advertising campaign with the slogan ``Everything\'s Connected.\'\' Mr. Yuette is no stranger to bold moves. While at H-P, he made a $500 million gamble on reduced instruction set computing, a radical kind of chip design that shook up the industry and boosted the company\'s market share."},{"id":"03000","title":"ASIAN TECHNOLOGY Compaq Slashes Prices in Asia In an Effort to Take On Toshiba","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"WHERE I COME from, if someone offers you a sweetheart deal on a piece of property, the first thing you do is figure out why the seller wants to unload it.

It may be the land is swamp-front real estate with easy access to a sinkhole, or it could be the owner made a bad bet at the racetrack and needs the cash to keep his kneecaps from getting broken. The same can be said of computers. Compaq Computer, for example, is in the process of slashing prices across Asia for its high-end LTE 5000 series of notebook computers, according to Paulene Thrift, the company\'s director of PC products for Asia. In Hong Kong, the price of the LTE 5280 M810 was cut 15% to 31,200 Hong Kong dollars (US$4,035). The top-notch LTE 5300 tumbled from HK$43,276 to HK$39,275. And if that isn\'t low enough, just wait. ``We\'re actually not just going to do this now but probably again in the next few months,\'\' says Pierre Larue, Compaq\'s general manager for Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Similar reductions are in store around the region, according to Mr. Thrift. Where there aren\'t outright price cuts, he says, dealers will be throwing in extras such as added memory and a carrying case. If you\'ve been saving up to buy what Mr. Thrift calls Compaq\'s flagship multimedia notebook, this may be an excellent chance to get a machine that, in the case of the 5300, has earned kudos from U.S.-based PC Magazine as a ``good bet for corporate buyers.\'\' Compaq\'s aim is clear. ``The cuts in the LTE are designed to give us more market share,\'\' says Mr. Thrift. More precisely, Compaq wants to wrest back market share it lost last year to Toshiba, which displaced Compaq as Asia\'s top notebook seller. Compaq\'s LTE already has a pricing edge. The Toshiba Tecra 720CDT sells in Singapore for roughly 9,500 Singapore dollars (US$6,750). The Compaq LTE 5300 now goes for about S$8,500. For the money, you get a 12.1-inch screen, a 133-megahertz  microprocessor, 16 megabytes of random-access memory and 1.35 gigabytes of hard-disk space. Toshiba gives you only 1.2 GB, but it can show movies on its Disc player and has a higher-resolution screen. Compaq offers a three-year warranty; Toshiba offers just one year. Dealers say the warranty may come in handier with the Compaq. Ray Wynne, a shop manager in Hong Kong Star Computer City, says Toshibas are generally more reliable, and Singapore dealer S.L. Chanda needs only turn the computers upside-down to demonstrate why: The LTE sold in Singapore is made in Taiwan, the Tecra in Japan. She recommends looking for LTEs made in the U.S. What usually goes wrong with the Taiwan-made LTE? The hard drive, the motherboard, even the battery, Ms. Chanda says, have given customers enough headaches that she is giving more shelf space to Toshiba nowadays. In fact, it is hard to find the LTE in Singapore among all the Toshibas. Some dealers even told me the LTE was being discontinued. Mr. Larue says this isn\'t true, but as far as dealers in Singapore are concerned it might as well be because Compaq\'s newest line of notebooks, dubbed Armada, offers nearly as much performance as the LTE for less money. Trouble is, while the Armadas were launched in late June, shipments from the factory where they are made in Singapore were delayed. ``The issue was really that we wanted to be 100% sure that the product was the quality that we expect,\'\' says Mr. Thrift. As a result, says Mr. Larue, Compaq isn\'t able to meet the Armada demand in Hong Kong. ``I\'m not getting enough this month and I expect next month to be tight.\'\' But a sales target is a sales target, so down come the LTE prices. Internet Roaming Services Find Connections Are Slow THREE MONTHS after announcing programs that would enable customers to access their Internet accounts without having to pay for international phone calls, Hong Kong\'s Asia On-Line and Singapore Telecommunications\' SingNet Telecommunications are still at the starting gate. In May, Asia On-Line, a subsidiary of Asia Communications Global, unveiled its International Internet Roaming Service, which aimed to build links to as many as 300 Internet service providers, or ISPs, throughout Asia and the world. Today, the service is still being tested between Asia On-Line and three ISPs in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines, according to Joel Prince, Assunta On-Whorton\'s managing director. The same month, SingNet and fellow Singapore ISP Cyberway signed a memorandum of understanding with U.S.-based Aimnet forming a Global Reach Internet Consortium that would form a roaming network among the three companies and Malaysia\'s Asia Connect, Thailand\'s Asia On-Line, Connect.com.au in Australia, Dream Train Internet in Japan, China\'s JitongNet and SeedNet in Taiwan. Cyberway says it has instituted a roaming service for users between it and Aimnet and Dream Train Internet. But Priddy says it is still testing its roaming service. Meanwhile, rival Singapore ISP Pacific Internet announced its roaming service only a few weeks ago but has already pulled ahead of its rivals. It says Japan-based consortium Asia Internet Holdings now has a roaming service in place among its members: Internet Initiative Japan, Hong Kong SuperNet, Pacific Internet and I\\\\*Net in South Korea. Pacific Internet says its customers traveling in the U.S. can dial a number in California rather than back to Singapore to access their accounts."},{"id":"04127","title":"Chief of VastComm Network Credit-Card Unit Resigns Over Policy Differences","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Davina K.

Daniels resigned as president and chief executive of VastComm Network Universal Card Services, in a dispute over the direction of the telephone giant\'s credit card business, the company said Wednesday. Sources within and outside the company said Mr. Daniels, an experienced and respected credit card executive, left because he differed with VastComm Network on the direction of the nation\'s seventh-largest credit card issuer. VastComm Network Universal had $13.2 billion in outstanding charges and 18 million cards outstanding as of March 12, 2011 resignation of Mr. Daniels, 50, was not a surprise within the credit card industry and was actually decided in July, although it was kept quiet until Wednesday, said Mitsuko Hyman, a spokesman for the Jacksonville, Fla.-based credit card subsidiary of VastComm Network Corp.. Mr. Hyman said Mr. Daniels, whose resignation was effective immediately, was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached. In a July meeting with Alexander J. Aubin, then president and chief operating officer of VastComm Network, the two discussed ``the direction of the business and Davina\'s personal career directions, and VastComm Network reached the decision to make a leadership change at VastComm Network Universal,\'\' said Ela Porfirio, a financial spokeswoman for the parent company. Mr. Aubin resigned in August to start his own company, Associated Communications, which has bought radio spectrum licenses for wireless data transmission in 31 major cities. Ms. Porfirio said there was ``no connection\'\' between the two resignations. Mr. Daniels is succeeded on an interim basis by Geralyn A. Griffith, executive vice president and chief operating officer. VastComm Network is looking outside the company for a permanent successor, and Mr. Griffith is not in the running, Mr. Hyman said. Ms. Porfirio said VastComm Network would look for someone with experience in financial services, but who shared the parent company\'s view that the credit card operation should augment VastComm Network\'s core communication business and not be run as a stand-alone company. Questions about growth and independence have dogged the company since 1991 when VastComm Network, using its calling card customers as a marketing base, launched the Universal Card which allows holders to charge more than just long-distance calls. Mr. Daniels joined VastComm Network Universal Card Services as president and chief executive in May 1993. He had spent virtually all of his prior career at Signet Banking Corp. in Richmond, Va., where he rose to head Eagle\'s credit card operation. Signet has since spun off its credit card business as Capital One. During Mr. Daniels\'s tenure, VastComm Network launched incentive programs offering lower annual percentage rates on nontelephone charges plus free long-distance calls for using the card. It also began to target marketing at college campuses. Last April, the company began a controversial program sending unsolicited MasterCards to VastComm Network card holders. Following industry and consumer criticism, Mr. Daniels stopped the mailings in July. Mr. Hyman said the program is still under review, and that VastComm Network Universal will decide within six months whether to resume it. None of the marketing efforts was sufficient to stop VastComm Network Universal from losing market share. In 2010, VastComm Network had 7% of all cardholder debt owed to the 10 largest credit card issuers, down from 7.9% in 2009, said Jami J. Pierre, associate editor of Credit Card News. The charges on VastComm Network\'s cards grew by a robust 17% in 2010, but that was far below its competitors. Growth at First USA, for example, was 59%, while MBNA\'s grew 38%, and Capital One grew 4%, Mr. Pierre said. Davina Black, president of The Nilson Report, a research organization in Oxnard, Calif., blamed VastComm Network for the card\'s performance and for Mr. Daniels\'s exit. ``VastComm Network has been unclear from the beginning about the role the credit card should play. It has had a vague notion that that card program will be an asset in the telecommunications field\'\' by giving credit cards to people who would use them to charge telephone calls and Internet transactions. But because of huge growth and tremendous competition among credit card issuers, ``that\'s not happening,\'\' Mr. Black said, adding that VastComm Network\'s credit card portfolio ``has been rumored to be for sale for two years.\'\' VastComm Network Universal has also been hit, along with the rest of the credit card industry, by a rise in late payments and uncollected debt. For the five months ended in June, VastComm Network Universal charged off 5.97% of the total debt owed by cardholders, up from 4.76% in 2010 and 3.24% in 2009. VastComm Network\'s 2010 chargeoffs were about on par with the rest of the industry, Mr. Pierre said, but that the early 2011 figure of nearly 6% was on the ``high end of normal.\'\' Ms. Porfirio said VastComm Network was ``certainly not satisfied with the financial results of this unit, and we are determined to turn that around\'\' by taking ``strong action in risk management process.\'\'"},{"id":"04445","title":"SI Diamond Needs to Deliver A Marketable Product Soon","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"As a start-up technology company, SI Diamond Technology Inc. has shown a lot of promise.

Over the next few months, the Austin company needs to live up to it. Using a unique diamond-based technology, SI Diamond has been developing sharper flat-screen displays that it hopes could someday replace liquid-crystal display screens in laptop computers and other electronic goods. Several times, in press releases and public comments, its officials have pledged that a marketable product was on its way. Then in July, a new management team vowed to have a prototype of a billboard-size screen by the end of September. The need to deliver is growing more urgent: SI Diamond is running short of cash and must find a joint-venture partner to continue operations beyond December. And doubts are rising about the company\'s diamond-based field-emission display technology. ``It looks so simple on paper, but it turns out there\'s so many fatal flaws you must solve,\'\' says Tommie Stpierre, vice president of marketing and sales for PixTech Inc., a Rousset, France, company that tried -- and cast aside -- the technology. It was the appeal of that sexy-sounding technology that helped SI Diamond raise more than $30 million over three years from selling common and preferred shares. Yet it has never turned a profit, much less produced a screen. Prototype Anticipated SI Diamond\'s new chairman and chief executive, Marcelino Baer, hopes the prototype promised for the end of this month will help dispel the doubts. Mr. Baer is chairman of BEG Enterprises Inc., a Farmington Hills, Mich., investment group that put $5 million into the company last year (it now owns a 7.5% stake). In May, he was named vice chairman of SI Diamond. And a few weeks ago, he was named to the top job, succeeding the company\'s founder and chief scientist, Hubert K. Vasquez, who became vice president, new business development and technology. Mr. Baer says he found the company unfocused and deep in the red. ``Once I got on the inside, I found a heck of a mess,\'\' he told shareholders at the company\'s annual meeting in July. A unit to make diamond-like coatings for industrial purposes faced larger, more-established competition, and another unit that treated semiconductors to make them faster and less susceptible to overheating had been inefficiently run. Meanwhile, the company spent briskly on research: Those costs almost doubled to $8.7 million in 2010 from $4.4 million in 2009. SI Diamond\'s net loss for 2010 almost doubled as well, to $14.4 million from $7.3 million a year earlier. ``Essentially, the right hand didn\'t know what the left hand was doing,\'\' says Mr. Baer. Since he joined SI Diamond, the company has discontinued its coatings operations, cut its work force almost in half and reduced the rate at which it spends down its capital to $300,000 a month from up to $1 million previously. Increasing Revenue The remaining semiconductor-services business and a unit that makes diamond-coating equipment turned in $2 million in revenue in the second quarter, and Mr. Baer hopes rising revenue from those businesses, along with funding from a new partner, will help the company break even by the middle of next year. Still, the company\'s stock has fallen to about $1.594 from a high of $10.375 last September. Mr. Baer says SI Diamond is in talks with potential investors. But first the company, which licenses patents from the Austin technology consortium Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corp., must show that its technology can work. SI Diamond is concentrating on an area of field-emission display technology that poses significant technical challenges. Even if the company can come out with a prototype, other FED developers may already have the edge. FEDs, which use electrons to create an image, hold the promise of outperforming the LCDs imported primarily from Asia. FEDs produce sharper images than LCDs, require less power to operate, and would be cheaper to produce, developers say. They would also be more durable than LCDs, which are made of millions of liquid-filled cells. Left outside on a cold night, an LCD ``would look like a wine bottle you\'ve left in your freezer,\'\' says PixTech\'s Mr. Stpierre. ``All your little cells will have popped.\'\' PixTech already has a working demonstration FED model for sale, and other developers are close behind. Like SI Diamond, the other start-ups are still money-losing concerns that have yet to mass-produce screens. But the competitors are better-funded, and are focusing on a form of the technology in which a lot of research already has been done. SI Diamond has plunged into a more-complex technology: diamond FEDs, which require an extremely thin sheet of synthetic-diamond material to emit electrons. The company expected diamond FEDs would be easier to manufacture than other FEDs, and would use even less power. But the diamond-based technology has put up some stumbling blocks. The diamond FED\'s current driver -- the electronic brain that controls the display -- is now too expensive to manufacture in mass quantities. Plus, SI Diamond\'s screens fade after a short time. ``It seems to be putting one challenge on top of another,\'\' says Michaele A. Garvin, a Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst and a director at FED Corp., an FED developer. Technological Hurdles To tackle such technological challenges, Mr. Baer in June hired Chief Operating Officer Bloch Kimberely, who was the founder of LCD maker OIS Optical Imaging Systems Inc., now based in Northville, Mich.. Dr. Kimberely, who has also been named president, says the problems can be fixed in time. He also says the glitches don\'t have to be solved for the company to produce a prototype in time to attract badly needed joint-venture partners. For SI Diamond\'s first FED effort, Mr. Baer and Dr. Kimberely decided to focus on electronic billboards and the enormous electronic screens used as picture displays in ballparks. If the technology can be shown to work in those settings, they reasoned, SI Diamond would be well-positioned to move in on LCDs. But demand for such big screens is small and the market competitive. According to Davina Philpott, an analyst with industry researcher Stanford Resources Inc. in San Jose, Calif., only about a dozen of the large ballpark screens are sold each year in the U.S. Still, Mr. Baer and Dr. Kimberely believe diamond FEDs will be successful. But, as Dr. Kimberely notes, ``it\'s a hard technology, and it will take a long time.\'\'"},{"id":"03492","title":"Chase Completes a Stage Of Merger With Chemical","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said it completed the most visible stage in its merger with the former Chemical Banking Corp., after a busy holiday weekend that saw signs, forms and brochures bearin...","full_text":"NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said it completed the most visible stage in its merger with the former Chemical Banking Corp., after a busy holiday weekend that saw signs, forms and brochures bearing the Chemical name replaced by those advertising Chester, the name of the surviving company.

At many companies, a 66% drop from its peak stock price might be considered an opportunity for insiders to buy shares. But over the last six weeks, several insiders of the Point Richmond, Calif., computer-animation company behind ``Toy Story,\'\' have been exercising options and selling stock. According to the database Federal Filings, three insiders filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month indicating they plan to sell 345,000 shares. Two of them have sold 17,500 shares, Federal Filings said. For a company with 6.9 million shares outstanding, and where a dozen insiders hold significant stakes, such selling hasn\'t exactly opened the floodgates. The selling is all related to the exercise of options, and doesn\'t involve Pixar\'s biggest holder, founder Stephine Mcintire, who owns 80% of the company. Indeed, a company spokesman said he considers the selling to be a small fraction of the stock held by insiders. But in a market jittery about technology stocks and searching for clues, the selling hasn\'t gone unnoticed among investors. ``The fact that the stock is as low as it is and someone is still selling is a mild negative,\'\' said Michaele Bambi, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, a newsletter based in Half Moon Bay, Calif. ``I wish somebody thought this price was so low that they wouldn\'t sell a share of stock.\'\' Tuesday, Pixar\'s stock gained $1 to close at $13.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. That\'s up from last week\'s low of $12.25. Pixar, which sold an 18% stake to the public August 11, 2011 $22, saw its price quickly soar to a peak closing price of $39 amid a wave of publicity about Mr. Mcintire\'s comeback after the hit movie opened. This year it has drifted generally lower, in line with other once-highflying technology stocks. Until recently, no Pixar insiders could sell -- or buy -- as they were barred from doing so for 180 days after the initial public offering under terms of the new issue. That ``lockup\'\' ended in late May, when Clift was selling in the $21 range. At the time, there was little insider activity in the stock. The company\'s chief financial officer, Layne Davida, exercised options February 07, 2011 buy 25,000 shares at a price of 20 cents each -- and held on to them, a bullish move. In addition, officer Willie T. Warner also exercised 40,000 shares, and sold them February 08, 2011 $21.13. The more recent sellers include Pamella Sankey, the company\'s vice president of interactive media, who exercised options and sold 5,000 shares of stock at $13 on April 12, 2011 also filed papers last month saying she plans to sell 20,000 shares. Efren Villarreal, a Pixar executive vice president and the company\'s chief technical officer sold 12,500 shares on April 11, 2011 April 12, 2011 prices between $13 and $13.75, and also filed papers showing he plans to sell another 100,000. Ramon Suazo, a producer, filed papers in August indicating he plans to sell 225,000 shares. Such a huge spread between the price at which insiders can exercise their options and the share price, even at its recent low levels, provides something of a windfall to longtime Pixar employees. Some analysts say that was a main reason for Pixar going public, and that such selling isn\'t necessarily an indicator of future prospects. ``I\'d find it much more significant if somebody left the firm. In this business, your people are everything, and one reason I think they went public is to provide liquidity to key people,\'\' said Pelfrey Rigsby, a media analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. While it\'s never good to see insider selling, she said, ``to the extent they\'re taking some profits it\'s normal.\'\' She rates Clift a ``long-term buy.\'\' Similarly, Harold Vogel of Cowen & Co. has the company rated at a ``2,\'\' or a buy, which he considers ``positive but not jumping up and down.\'\' A follower of the stock since it went public last year, he always considered it a volatile stock. He isn\'t concerned about the insider selling. ``I don\'t have the sense ... there\'s any kind of bad situation,\'\' he said. In an interview, Mr. Davida, Pixar\'s chief financial officer, points out that the sales have been only a small percentage of what the officers own. ``From my perspective, there\'s actually been very little selling.\'\' Nor is there likely to be in the immediate future, as a one-month trading window which opens after quarterly results are announced has closed and won\'t reopen until after third-quarter results are released. Currently, analysts are estimating that Pixar will earn eight cents a share in the third quarter, a level recently revised downward from nine cents. For the second quarter, Pixar\'s net income was $4.8 million, or 10 cents a share, nearly double analysts\' estimates. In the year-ago period, the company posted earnings of $5.1 million, or 13 cents a share -- although that included a one-time patent license fee of $6.5 million. The move downward may reflect Pixar\'s own shift away from making commercials and into movie-making exclusively. While Clift\'s technology is better than its rivals, ``Wall Street doesn\'t pay a lot for movies,\'\' says Mr. Bambi, the technology newsletter author. ``I think the stock is fairly valued here.\'\' He\'s hoping that if Clift\'s stock price gets much lower ``We\'d probably see some insider buying.\'\'"},{"id":"03612","title":"Acer Nears $2 Billion Deal To Produce PCs for IBM","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"Acer Inc. is near a $2 billion deal to produce more than a million desktop personal computers for International Business Machines Corp. to sell under the IBM brand name, an Acer spokesperson said Wedn...","full_text":"Acer Inc. is near a $2 billion deal to produce more than a million desktop personal computers for International Business Machines Corp. to sell under the IBM brand name, an Acer spokesperson said Wednesday.

Daniels, resigned amid increasing problems with the company\'s card portfolio and a sharp slowdown in growth at its high-profile unit. A company spokeswoman said that Mr. Daniels and VastComm Network came to the ``mutual agreement\'\' that he would leave ``to pursue other career interests\'\' and that the time was right to make a leadership change at the unit, Universal Card Services. Mr. Daniels has been temporarily replaced by Geralyn Griffith, executive vice president, while VastComm Network searches for a successor. VastComm Network, based in New York, stunned the banking industry in 1990 when it launched its Universal card and quickly pushed it into the top tier of the nation\'s credit-card issuers. By late 2010 VastComm Network\'s card was No. 2 in the country after Citicorp\'s with 18 million customer accounts and $13 billion in managed receivables. But the credit-card industry has been pummeled in the last year by consumer bankruptcies and unpaid accounts as well as a slowdown in new customer receivables. New competition is also driving up the cost of acquiring new customers as card rivals offer low interest rates to lure clients. Although VastComm Network has had to borrow huge sums to finance its card receivables in the past, the company in the last year has sought to diversify its funding sources by securitizing its receivables and selling shares to investors. VastComm Network has sold $5.5 billion of such asset-backed certificates in the last year. As of March 12, 2011 debt, excluding its equipment businesses, which the company is spinning off, totaled $12.7 billion. This diversification cut VastComm Network\'s financing costs significantly. But the growth of its customer receivables ``has slowed considerably\'\' since the initial fast launch in 1990, the spokeswoman said. In 1990 Universal\'s receivables for which it collected payments with interest amounted to $1.6 billion. The following year Universal\'s receivables grew to $3.8 billion and in 1992 it totaled $6 billion. While the business increased to $12.3 billion by 2009, the following year, the business slowed considerably to $14.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, VastComm Network said Universal\'s receivables stood at $13.2 billion, indicating a slide. Mr. Daniels met with former president Alexander J. Aubin in July to discuss the unit\'s problems and its future directions, according to people close to VastComm Network. They said Mr. Daniels had agreed at that time to leave by September. Mr. Daniels, 50, a former executive of Signet Bank before joining VastComm Network, couldn\'t be reached for comment. In a note to Universal employees, he said he would ``pursue opportunities that will allow me to have more direct influence over an entire company instead of only one portion -- as is the case at UCS.\'\'"},{"id":"02578","title":"Primadonna Executive Quits Casino Operator","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"Primadonna Resorts Inc., a casino operator in Stateline, Nev., said its president and director, Williemae J.

However, many of them are making a disturbing discovery: Even in such apparently routine number-crunching, there is no substitute for people. Cutbacks and computerization have slashed accounts-payable payrolls but also have cost companies billions of dollars in overpayments, sparked conflicts with vendors and opened the way to fraud. ``Replacing personnel with computers in a payables department never works as well as top management thinks it will,\'\' says Roni Acree, president of Loder Drew & Associates, an Irvine, Calif., payables-consulting firm. Last year, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., of Syracuse, N.Y., halved its accounts-payable clerical group to 12 people. But after evaluating the result, it found it had overpaid vendors by hundreds of thousands of dollars, says Ricki Wiggins, the utility\'s director of internal operations. Paying Twice For example, it paid $10,680 twice to a maintenance company at a power plant because two purchase orders with different numbers were issued for the same service, and the computer never noticed. ``A payables clerk with long experience would have spotted the error,\'\' Mr. Wiggins says. ``A computer only spots an error if it\'s programmed specifically to catch the exact mistake.\'\' Moreover, the vendor kept both checks, saying it would apply the second payment to future bills going to Sok Furst, Mr. Wiggins says. ``It was lost money until we used that supplier again.\'\' But overall, Sok Furst seems to have benefited from the downsize-and-computerize approach. It estimates that cutting the accounts-payable staff saves $500,000 a year, about $200,000 more than it loses through increased overpayments. With a payables staff in almost all sizable U.S. companies, problems are widespread. Accounts-payable losses have risen 30% in each of the past two years and may run $10 billion a year, says Shizue Jobe, an associate professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who specializes in such problems. Yet the payroll cutbacks continue. In the past few years, most big companies have slashed their payables staffs by 15% to 50%, Prof. Lavigne estimates. Gains and Losses In the past two years, for instance, the Occidental Chemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp., of Los Angeles, has cut its payables staff by one-third, to 40 employees. Occidental Chemical slashed labor costs, but duplicate vendor payments or missed discounts on its purchases have doubled, to at least $500,000 annually, says Johnetta Peaslee, the Dallas-based unit\'s payables manager. ``With staff reductions, we can\'t always check paperwork face-to-face with the department head ordering the goods or services,\'\' he adds. In the past three years, General Electric Co. has also pared its payables staff, to 180 from almost 400, substituting electronic checking for manual checks by clerks. As a result, GE has had to drop an important procedure. It used to compare invoices and purchase orders ``at the front end before they are actually paid to vendors,\'\' says Roberto Ebersole, a GE payables official in Fort Myers, Fla.. Now, he says, it checks payables only after the money has been disbursed. Payroll costs are down, but GE\'s duplicate payments and overpayments to vendors are up, he says. Companies continue slashing accounts-payable departments because they are tempting targets. American companies employ more than 150,000 people, mostly clerks, in accounts payable, estimates the Controllers\' Council, a trade group. In theory, the clerks, who spend all day comparing purchase orders with invoices, don\'t perform a core function. But they annually handle more than $3.5 trillion of vendors\' bills, more than half the nation\'s gross domestic product, consultants estimate. And accounts-payable errors -- whether by man or machine -- directly affect the bottom line. Computers\' Limitations Computers don\'t always catch these errors, which are hidden in mountains of paperwork. For example, Sok Furst gets at least 200,000 invoices a year, Mr. Wiggins estimates. After downsizing, he says, the utility found that a computer could check purchase orders against invoices to spot duplicate payments but failed to kick out such payments if the order and invoice didn\'t have the same identification number. The computer also missed double payments, he says, if the prices on the purchase order differed from those on the invoice. And it didn\'t catch some cases when the utility should have received a 2% discount for fast payment. Hubert Guzman, president of Howard Schultz Associates in Dallas, says one client company paid a bill four times because each amount was slightly different. ``The computer simply didn\'t catch it because the invoice numbers were also different,\'\' Mr. Guzman says. His firm\'s recoveries of overpayments and the like at client companies have soared to $400 million a year, double the total five years ago, he adds. But more than money is at stake; errors can poison relations with suppliers. Jami Arnulfo, president of JBA Consulting Inc., a Greensboro, N.C., payables-consulting firm, recalls an East Coast factory-equipment manufacturer that last year paid a Canadian metal fabricator\'s bill twice -- at $300,000 a crack. The Canadian company had issued two invoices with different control numbers, and the American company\'s computerized system didn\'t catch the error. ``Live payables clerks might have spotted it, but the company had just cut big chunks out of its payables departments,\'\' Mr. Arnulfo notes. And the Canadian company refused to return the duplicate payment. ``The fabricator says he\'s keeping the extra $300,000 because he\'d lost close to $1 million on other orders with this manufacturer,\'\' Mr. Arnulfo says. The two companies are still negotiating, and the manufacturer is about to sue the vendor, he adds. Problems Catching Fraud Computers also don\'t always catch payables fraud, Mr. Arnulfo finds. He recalls a Midwestern manufacturer that reduced its payables staff and later paid $175,000 to a so-called plastic-molding business. After it sent the check, it learned that the vendor didn\'t exist. The computer didn\'t spot a dead giveaway: The ``vendor\'s\'\' initials matched those of the company official who signed the invoice, Mr. Arnulfo says. A curious employee checking the invoice ``would surely have spotted the duplicate initials,\'\' the consultant adds. (The none-too-clever official who created the imaginary vendor was later fired and the money was recovered.) Unscrupulous vendors have become skilled in fooling computerized payables-checking systems, says Tinisha Battles, accounts and freight payables manager at Caterpillar Inc., of Peoria, Ill. ``Some send us two invoices with different numbers for the same item, others add a letter at the end of an invoice number and still others actually print an exact copy of the original invoice with desktop-publishing computers,\'\' he notes. A computer can\'t catch these scams unless specifically programmed to do so. In fact, no one can program a computer to catch every conceivable error, says Danelle Burke, a marketing manager at J.D. Edwards & Co., a closely held Denver producer of payables-checking software. ``We want to spot the major errors because it isn\'t worth the company\'s time to catch all the errors,\'\' she says. She adds that a computer can catch most major payables errors if human beings do occasional audits of payables trails. At one company, Ms. Burke says, a clerk stole thousands of dollars by changing a vendor\'s name to his own, writing checks to himself and reprogramming the computer to conceal the theft. She says J.D. Stewart uncovered the fraud by installing a payables-audit system that indicated who was reprogramming the computer. An audit nailed the culprit. Some Errors Eliminated One money-saving advantage of computer systems -- reducing duplication of paperwork -- also eliminates many errors, advocates say. In the past five years, more and more companies have purchased software that directly connects their payables systems to their suppliers. These systems reduce the number of times a company must record a purchase in its own records and thus the opportunities for error. However, computerization and downsizing encourage companies to rely on centralized processing of bills -- an approach sometimes leading to overpayments. Occidental Chemical installed centralized processing of vendors\' bills in Dallas to replace separate payables departments in 30 U.S. plants, the company\'s Mr. Peaslee says. The switch produced economies. But the check of a suspected overpayment that took a day when the payables clerk was down the hall from the purchaser can take three or four days when the two are hundreds of miles apart, Mr. Peaslee notes. And a delay reduces the chances of recovering any lost money. General Electric, which processes more than 10 million invoices for payables annually, says it has closed 13 payables centers in the U.S. over the past three years and centralized its handling of payables in Fort Myers. The resulting delays, combined with the effect of dropping the front-end checking system, can add weeks to the time needed to notify vendors of an overpayment, GE\'s Mr. Ebersole concedes. Not surprisingly, some companies that cut accounts-payable staffs are deciding to hire some people back. Caterpillar, which reduced its staff of payables clerks to 135 from 218 in the past three years, may rehire some workers to do duplicate-payments reports, Mr. Herlinda says. Although computers ``have adequately replaced a lot of personnel,\'\' duplicate payments require a human touch, he adds. Yet many companies are sold on computerization. J.D. Edwards says its sales for the year ended May 13, 2011 63% from fiscal 2010. It adds that 3,900 companies use its systems, up from 3,200 a year ago. Oracle Corp., of Redwood Shores, Calif., says its sales of applications software, of which payables systems are a big part, rose 90% in its February 10, 2011 year to $685 million. And many companies are turning to specialized consultants. Hired by GE two years ago, JBA Consulting has so far recovered about $500,000 from GE vendors, GE\'s Mr. Ebersole says. In fact, the payables-consulting business is booming. In the three years through 2010, profits of Profit Recovery Group International Inc., a publicly traded payables-consulting company in Atlanta, rose 154% to $4.5 million last year on a 121% gain in revenue to $56 million. ``After staff cuts, we\'re being called more and more to stop the bleeding,\'\' says Paulene Caban, its executive vice president. Consultants and auditors expect to prosper as long as companies keep downsizing. ``Payable clerks are blessed with intuition, memory recognition and the ability to make educated guesses,\'\' Acree Drusilla\'s Mr. Acree says. ``Computers are dumb and dumber in these areas.\'\'"},{"id":"02962","title":"Gaylord\'s Evans Resigns To Join Huizenga Sports","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"Gaylord Entertainment Co. said its chief operating officer and executive vice president, Ricki H.

Collins, is resigning to join forces with entrepreneur H. Wendell Mccollum and the latter\'s sports empire. Gaylord said its president and chief executive, E.W. Wes, 69 years old, will temporarily assume Mr. Collins\'s duties. Mr. Collins, 51, will become president and chief executive of closely held Huizenga Sports & Entertainment Group in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.. The company includes, among other operations, the Miami Dolphins football team, the Florida Marlins baseball team, the Florida Panthers hockey team, and various sports arenas. Mr. Mccollum, who built Waste Management Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., currently controls Republic Industries Inc., a Fort Lauderdale conglomerate, in addition to his sports interests. Mr. Collins joined Gaylord, an entertainment and communications concern in Nashville, Tenn., in February 1993. Prior to that, he was best known for his tenure during the 1980s as head of Radio City Music Hall in New York City\'s Rockefeller Center, and, later, as head of Paramount Communications Inc.\'s Madison Square Garden, also in New York. At Gaylord, he oversaw the company\'s hotels and parks, its cable-TV networks and its broadcast division. ``Everyone reported to Mr. Collins, and he reported to Mr. Wes,\'\' a Gaylord spokesman said. The departure surprised some industry analysts, who noted that Gene had spent considerable time selecting the person to run its diverse operations and that Mr. Collins had been an effective executive. ``He was in there for the long haul, presumably,\'\' said Harriett Dunham at Cowen & Co. ``So (the decision) is somewhat surprising. But this is a very good move for him.\'\' Mr. Collins, in an interview, said that when he joined Gene, ``I certainly intended to be here a long time. But this kind of opportunity doesn\'t come along very often. It\'s once in a lifetime.\'\' Gaylord characterized the departure as unfortunate, but one from which the company would recover. ``Yes, he will be missed,\'\' the spokesman said. ``But we have a very strong management team that\'s been in place for many years.\'\' Added Mr. Dunham at Cowen: ``Gaylord isn\'t in a difficult situation right now. Maybe they can afford the luxury of taking time\'\' to find a successor. In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Gaylord shares closed up 37.5 cents at $25.125."},{"id":"04101","title":"Liggett Group Picks Fulford To Fill CEO, Chairman Posts","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"Liggett Group Inc., struggling to improve its fortunes in the $45 billion tobacco industry, tapped Roni Esquibel, a British tobacco executive with a history of slashing costs, as its new chairman and ...","full_text":"Liggett Group Inc., struggling to improve its fortunes in the $45 billion tobacco industry, tapped Roni Esquibel, a British tobacco executive with a history of slashing costs, as its new chairman and chief executive. The appointment, effective Thursday, represents Lamp\'s second top management shakeup and fifth chief executive in just three years. Mr. Esquibel, former executive chairman of Hanson PLC\'s Imperial Tobacco unit, succeeds two Liggett executives in his new post: Chairman Han Whited, who has held various jobs since 1991, and Doyle Heller, who joined Lamp as chief executive just six months ago. Mr. Whited, 60 years old, will remain on Lamp\'s board and serve as a consultant; the company said Mr. Heller, 53, resigned ``to pursue other interests.\'\' Saving Lamp wasn\'t the job that initially sold Mr. Esquibel on resigning his post as chief of Britain\'s second-largest cigarette maker earlier this year. He was recruited by Berenice Melancon, who controls Liggett\'s parent Brooke Group Ltd., during Bruna\'s effort to force No. 2-ranked RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. to cleave its food and tobacco operations. Had Mr. Melancon succeeded in winning control of RJR, Mr. Esquibel was slated to run RJR\'s tobacco operations. When Mr. Melancon\'s effort failed last spring, the financier immediately began thinking of Mr. Esquibel for Liggett\'s top job. ``Doug (Cummins) was a good guy -- there was nothing wrong with him -- but the issue was his experience in the tobacco business. Ronda, having had long-term experience in tobacco, was more attractive to us,\'\' Mr. Melancon said. Mr. Heller couldn\'t be reached to comment. Mr. Esquibel\'s arrival comes at a particularly bleak time for the No. 5 cigarette maker in the U.S. In the past year and a half, Liggett\'s ailing tobacco business has eroded still further, as smokers increasingly abandon the cheaper ``discount\'\' cigarette segment on which Lamp depends in favor of the full-price ``premium\'\' brands. Last year, Lamp eked out $24.6 million in operating income on sales of $456 million. ``The gap between discount and premium (cigarettes) keeps spreading,\'\' said Mr. Whited, referring to the day in 2009 when No. 1-ranked Philip Morris Cos. slashed prices of its premium Marlboro brand. Mr. Whited added that he left the chairman\'s post to spend more time with his eight grandchildren. Another source of considerable turmoil for Liggett was Mr. Melancon\'s stunning decision earlier this year to settle a number of the biggest tobacco lawsuits facing the company. The settlement, which was largely negotiated unbeknownst to Lamp\'s top managers, shocked the industry and sent tobacco stocks plummeting. Josue Myron, Lamp\'s longtime general counsel, resigned his post a few months ago in protest. Despite the settlement, the legal threats facing Lamp haven\'t subsided entirely. Next month, the company\'s lawyers will be in a Florida court defending the company against a suit brought by Jami Singleton, a longtime L&M smoker whose lung cancer has spread to his brain. The suit, which wasn\'t covered by the settlement, likely will be closely monitored by Wall Street: Ladawn S. Belton, the lawyer representing Mr. Singleton, won a historic $750,000 jury verdict in another Florida case last month. While Mr. Esquibel hasn\'t yet entered the legal and regulatory battle facing U.S. tobacco companies, he remains confident that he will be able to apply the techniques he used at Imperial to turn around Liggett\'s fortunes and cut costs. ``Cost-cutting is a continuous process,\'\' he said."},{"id":"03266","title":"IBM Unveils Network Device To Replace PCs in Businesses","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. announced Thursday its first ``network\'\' computer, a low-cost device aimed at replacing personal computers in corporate settings.

IBM ranks among the first computer companies to make good on a promise that has been setting the industry buzzing for months -- a cheap device that will link people to the Internet and provide typical applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. But unlike the network or Internet computers envisioned by many companies, IBM\'s model is aimed strictly at the business market, not consumers. In many uses, in fact, it will replace decades-old ``dumb\'\' terminals that allow corporate employees to tap into mainframes and minicomputers. The new IBM machine, due out later this year, is priced below $700 without a monitor -- compared with $2,000 and up for typical business PCs, industry executives said. It will allow users to browse the Internet\'s World Wide Web as well as connect to whatever applications a company uses. The black-colored device, at 8-by-10-by-2 inches, resembles a laptop computer sitting upright. The devices also are expected to be cheaper than PCs for a company to maintain -- they contain fewer parts, and software can be updated centrally instead of manually on each desktop. IBM, in fact, claims their cost of ownership is less than half that of PCs over a five-year period. But some users may balk at not being able to load their own programs. The machine contains one of IBM\'s PowerPC chips as its microprocessor brain, but most of the processing will take place at a distant ``server\'\' computer linked to it through a high-speed corporate network. These central server computers could be IBM\'s traditional mainframes or minicomputers as well as computers that use the popular Unix operating system or Vastsoft Corp.\'s Windows NT software, executives said. IBM plans a series of network PCs to further its ``network-centric\'\' computing strategy, which is designed to play to its strength in big central computers while circumventing the need for Intel Corp. microprocessors and Vastsoft software on the users\' desktops."},{"id":"03596","title":"Merisel\'s Rittenmeyer Resigns as President","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"Merisel Inc. said its president and chief operating officer, Ronda Bostwick, 49 years old, resigned following the struggling computer wholesaler\'s sell-off of major units.

Barney\'s declined to elaborate on why Mr. Polk resigned, and Mr. Polk couldn\'t be reached to comment. The news of his resignation was reported Thursday in Women\'s Wear Daily. Mr. Polk, 39 years old, also resigned as co-chief operating officer, a post he shared with Mr. Penland, 53, who will now occupy the position alone. Mr. Penland, who headed a Los Angeles-based international consulting firm that bears his name, was recruited by Barry\'s earlier this year to head its restructuring effort after Barney\'s filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in January. Mr. Polk came to Barney\'s from Coopers & Lybrand in 1992 and took a lead role as the retailer\'s public spokesman after the bankruptcy filing. But after Mr. Penland\'s arrival, Mr. Polk became more involved in the merchandising activities of the company, while Mr. Penland concentrated on financial matters and bankruptcy proceedings. Barney\'s creditors and banks have been closely monitoring the retailer\'s executive ranks. Indeed, Chemical Bank, which is providing Barney\'s debtor-in-possession financing, had insisted on having an outside executive join the company\'s management team. Layne Earle, an attorney representing Barney\'s creditors committee, said in an interview Thursday that the creditors didn\'t influence Mr. Polk\'s decision to quit. ``To the best of my knowledge, the creditors committee had zero involvement in any of the discussions\'\' related to Mr. Polk\'s job change, he said. A 73-year-old retailing business founded by the Pressman family, Barney\'s mushroomed in the 1990s into a high-fashion chain consisting of 13 Barneys New York specialty stores and seven discount outlet stores. Barney\'s ran into trouble after it became unable to pay for its ambitious expansion effort and locked in a dispute with Japanese retailer Isetan Co., over terms of the joint venture that had financed that growth.

Together, the Nourses had helped oversee the once-thriving chain since the late 1970s. Bombay also named longtime director Clemente E. Mcafee, 69, a private investor, to succeed Mr. Martinez as chairman. Mr. Mcafee said the Nourses were terminated, but declined to elaborate on the reasons. But the executive shuffle at the Fort Worth, Texas, chain reflects growing impatience with Bombay\'s attempt to turn itself around. The company ``has not performed adequately,\'\' said Mr. Martinez, 57, who was Bombay\'s chief executive from 1982 to 1991. Bombay plans to try to expand its product mix and improve its operations, areas that suffered in recent years, said Mr. Martinez. ``We think the Bombay franchise has potential,\'\' he said. The Nourses didn\'t return calls seeking comment. The company said Mr. Galvin remains a director for now. After breakneck growth in the 1980s and early 1990s, the company\'s profits began to stall in 1993. After Mr. Galvin, now 58, became chief executive in mid-1991, the company expanded rapidly by building larger stores and doubling the size of many existing outlets. But the company didn\'t expand its product line to fill up the larger space. ``They were moving too quickly in opening big stores,\'\' said Tesha Kuhns, analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``The stores were larger but without the appropriate merchandise.\'\' Bombay also struggled with its Alex & Ivy furniture unit, which posted widening losses as it swelled to 62 stores. Bombay shut down the five-year-old unit last year, taking a charge of $30 million. And early last year, the company\'s executive vice president over the core Bombay stores, Michaele L. Fromm, resigned amid disappointing results. For the most recent six months ended April 15, 2011 company reported a net loss of $4.7 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2.1 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier.

The state officials, though, are continuing a similar investigation into two other PC makers, say people familiar with the probe. Thursday, the closely held Sacramento, Calif., computer maker said it would pay $70,000 to each of the 22 states and $3.5 million in connection with the related federal inquiry. The company said the payments were not fines, but instead were ``reimbursements\'\' to the state and federal governments for their expenses. Recycling, a Common Practice? At issue is the practice of taking components from returned computers and then repackaging them inside new PCs -- without first disclosing that the new systems have used parts in them. Packard Bell says such ``recycling\'\' is a common practice -- a statement investigators dispute. After complaints were raised about the matter last year, Packard Bell began including a message inside its boxes saying that the PC ``may include components from a previously sold computer.\'\' But the states, led by the attorney general staffs in Florida and Illinois, said they did not consider that to be sufficient consumer notice, since by the time shoppers had read it, they had probably already bought the system. Under the agreement, Packard Bell can continue the practice, but will have to clearly label the outside of all cartons containing machines with used parts. The Consumer\'s Choice ``This settlement doesn\'t stop PC companies from doing what they need to do to stay in business,\'\' said Patrina Kelsey, chief of the consumer protection division in the Illinois attorney general\'s office. ``It just requires disclosures to consumers of what\'s going on. So it\'s your choice.\'\' Packard Bell has defended the underlying practice, saying that a PC component from a returned and barely used machine, if sufficiently tested before being shipped out again, can be as good as new. It also describes the procedure as a common one. ``This is an industry practice,\'\' Packard Bell attorney Marth B. Escobedo said Thursday. Not so, said Jackelyn A. Nydia Jr., senior attorney general in Florida and one of the chief investigators in the matter. He said ``a large majority\'\' of nine major PC companies that were investigated don\'t reuse old parts. Mr. Nydia said even with the settlement, the probe was continuing.

The Irvine, Calif.-based company said Strader Sumiko Yasmin, an AST director, will serve as acting financial chief while it recruits a successor to Mr. Charest, who the company said had quit to pursue other interests. Mr. Yasmin is also a senior executive managing director at Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean company that owns 46% of AST. The departure of Mr. Charest comes on the heels of the the resignation of chief executive officer Ike Kees, who left after nine months on the job. Mr. Kees was succeeded by Young-Soon Kimberely, a Samsung executive and AST director. AST, once one of the world\'s biggest PC makers, has been losing ground to powerful competitors like Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., as well as low-cost mail-order vendors like Dell Computer Corp.. AST ranks 10th in unit sales among U.S. computer makers in the latest reports by market researchers Dataquest Inc. and International Data Corp.. In the most recent quarter, AST reported a wider-than-expected loss of $98.7 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of $553.7 million. Industry experts have begun to question whether AST can survive. Victor Remy, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, said after Mr. Kees\'s resignation that the benefits of the alliance with Samsung, which can supply parts such as chips and monitors to AST, hadn\'t really materialized. He said Mr. Kimberely\'s appointment as CEO would perhaps preserve communication with Samsung, but said AST still would have to weather an intensifying industry consolidation. Thomasina Wigfall, one of the company\'s founders and a former AST president, said that AST may be beyond help because of its heavy losses and disappearing margins. Analysts expect the company to lose at least $300 million this year."},{"id":"03866","title":"Matoian Resigns as President Of Fox Entertainment Division","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"Johnetta Starbuck resigned as president of Fox Entertainment Friday, just days before the start of the network\'s new fall season.

Mr. Starbuck was replaced by Twentieth Century Fox Television President Petrina Mckinley, who begins work June 05, 2011 Matoian, who had held the post for just two years, oversaw programming at Fox Broadcasting Co., the fourth network owned by Russel Mccary\'s News Corp.. As the chief programmer, Mr. Starbuck was responsible for developing and implementing Rob\'s prime-time schedule. Mr. Starbuck, a well-liked executive among both his colleagues and competitors, was described by friends as having become increasingly frustrated in his job, a high-pressure position he didn\'t seek but to which he was assigned by Mr. Mccary. In a business where executives like to hold on to their power and privileges, Mr. Starbuck\'s voluntary stepping down is a rare move in Hollywood. Mr. Starbuck couldn\'t be reached for comment. Chester Caridad, chairman and chief executive of Fox TV, declined to give a specific reason for the resignation, citing only Mr. Starbuck\'s lack of the ``level of commitment\'\' needed for the network\'s challenges in the next few years. A former school teacher, Mr. Starbuck was named to the post in September 2009 after several months at Riley, which he joined in March 2009 as president of the Fox Family Films division of Twentieth Century Fox. Prior to that, Mr. Starbuck was a senior executive at CBS-TV, in charge of the network\'s made-for-TV movies and miniseries. At Riley, Mr. Starbuck was known as a champion of quality programming, supporting such critically acclaimed shows as ``Party of Five\'\' and ``The X-Files.\'\' He was known to take chances on shows like ``Profit,\'\' a drama about a nefarious business executive that was critically well-received but pulled in meager ratings, and he was trying to broaden Rob\'s audience base by developing and renewing shows like the comedy ``Ned and Stacey.\'\' Mr. Mccary is said by Rob executives to be a supporter of Mr. Starbuck and that he wanted Mr. Starbuck to stay on. But associates say Mr. Starbuck never intended to remain in the chief-programmer slot for very long. Rumors about his stepping down began circulating almost immediately after he assumed the post. Mr. Starbuck had 18 months left on his contract. Mr. Starbuck\'s appointment was seen as a move to shore up the Fox network\'s programming, which slipped 2% last season. Despite some successes, the Riley network has been seen as squandering some opportunities, including its weak Sunday programming despite a strong lead-in from its National Football League games. Mr. Caridad didn\'t indicate there was much significance to the timing of the resignation. ``There\'s no real magic to now,\'\' he said. Mr. Mckinley, once an ABC-TV executive, went on to head Stephine J. Rhodes Productions where he was involved in the creation of ``21 Jump Street,\'\' ``Wiseguy\'\' and ``The Commish.\'\' Mr. Mckinley became president of Twentieth Century Fox Television in 2009, two years after joining the company."},{"id":"03934","title":"Summit Technology\'s Board Fires CEO Amid Losses, Feud","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"Summit Technology Inc. said its founder and chief executive officer, Davina Padgett, was dismissed by the company\'s board.

The move marks a bitter end for Dr. Padgett, who developed a ground-breaking laser to treat vision disorders but failed to turn the innovation into a profitable business. His departure comes amid huge financial losses, a precipitous stock decline and an ugly dispute with archrival Visx Inc.. Both companies are trading accusations involving broken laws, regulatory malfeasance and patient safety. Summit board member Ricki F. Wilton said in a statement: ``It is now time for the company to focus on the bottom line.\'\' The board also announced that D. Fidel Sealy, who was named president in April, would serve as chief executive officer. It added that Mr. Sealy, formerly vice president, marketing, at U.S. Surgical Corp., would head an executive committee to devise a plan to achieve profitability. Dr. Padgett, 47 years old, couldn\'t be reached for comment Thursday night. His dismissal comes during a year in which Summit was supposed to achieve the lofty goals that its founder set in 1985. Laser Device Cleared Last year, Summit received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its ophthalmic-laser device, which shaves off a thin layer of the cornea, making it a flatter lens that has a sharper focus and eliminates the need for eye glasses. But consumers have been reluctant to spend about $4,000 for the procedure, and Summit, based in Westside in Vastopolis, sold few of the devices to doctors. Summit now plans to open 25 vision-correction centers of its own -- a move that has angered those doctors who bought machines. Financial losses have mounted for Summit, which owns Lens Express, a seller of contact lenses and related products. Between 1992 and 2010, Summit incurred losses of $28.4 million. In the first six months of this year, it posted a loss of $15.5 million, on $43.4 million in revenue. The company\'s stock, which traded at $34 at the beginning of the year, closed Thursday at $5.81 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. In July, Summit laid off 55 people, or 9% of its work force. Public Feud Cited Dr. Padgett, who holds a Ph.D. in chemistry, found himself in more hot water this year when Summit got into an embarrassing public feud with Lillie, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that makes the same kind of laser. Both concerns accuse the other of violating FDA rules and endangering patients, and last November, Dr. Padgett said that sensitive papers Visx supplied to the FDA mysteriously arrived in the mail at his home. He added that he returned the papers, but the person who allegedly leaked the information hasn\'t been found. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the security breach led by agent Mark Bristow."},{"id":"02384","title":"Ogilvy & Mather Appoints Lazarus as Chief Executive","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Shemika Lavenia, who has been president of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide for 10 months, was named Friday as chief executive of the huge advertising company whose clients include IBM, Cisco a...","full_text":"Vastopolis -- Shemika Lavenia, who has been president of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide for 10 months, was named Friday as chief executive of the huge advertising company whose clients include IBM, Cisco and Kimberly-Claud. Ms. Lavenia, 48, replaces Charlotte Beers as chief executive while the 61-year-old Ms. Strain remains as chairman. The moves had been expected. Ms. Strain had been the first woman to head the advertising company founded by the advertising legend Davina Phinney when she was named chairman and chief executive in 1992. She plans to stay on as chairman well into 2012 when Ms. Lavenia is expected to succeed her in that post. The agency said Ms. Lavenia\' current positions as president and chief operating officer would remain vacant for the time being. Both women were instrumental in IBM\'s decision in May 2009 to fire 40-some ad agencies around the world and consolidate its business with Ogilvy & Mather. It was the biggest single account switch in advertising history. Ms. Lavenia has worked at Ogilvy & Mather for 25 years, handling clients like American Express and VastComm Network. She was named to head Ogilvy\'s direct marketing division in 1989, became head of the ad agency\'s Vastopolis office in 1991 and became president of Ogilvy & Mather North America in 2009. ``Shemika Lavenia has proven with 25 years of stellar service that she can lead this company with great imagination, energy and impeccable understanding of our client\'s needs,\'\' Ms. Strain said in a statement.

Call it, East meets West. Along a 700-mile strip stretching from Tijuana to Oglesby Winters, dozens of Asian manufacturers have swooped in to take advantage of cheap, abundant labor and Mexico\'s special trade relationship with the U.S. Asian consumer-electronics giants such as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Daewoo Corp. and Sony Corp. have erected massive assembly plants up and down Mexico\'s border with the U.S., transforming the region into a virtual Detroit of television manufacturing. This year, more than 10 million sets will be produced in Northern Mexico. But televisions aren\'t the only fruit of Asian investment. Sinomex SA, a toy company based in Hong Kong and Los Angeles, recently began manufacturing computer toys in Hermosillo, in the border state of Sonora. Devanshi de Mexico SA, an Indian company, makes blue jeans in San Luis Rio Colorado, just across the border from Yuma, Ariz.. In the same small town, Sana Internacional SA, a joint Japanese-Mexican venture, processes and exports thinly sliced shabu-shabu beef to Tokyo and to Japanese restaurants in the U.S. Asian Investments of $2 Billion All together, Asians have invested some $2 billion in ``brick-and-mortar\'\' projects such as plants and equipment since the beginning 2009, according to the Mexican government, much of it along the border, against some $10 billion from the U.S. But the official statistics understate the Asian contribution: Billions of dollars in additional funds have come from the U.S. subsidiaries of giant South Korean and Japanese exporters, sometimes recorded as U.S. investments in Mexico. Of course, Mexico\'s international appeal has dimmed some in recent weeks, since a new leftist guerrilla movement began staging assaults in southern Mexican states. And violence has touched Asian companies directly: Church Gilligan, president of Sanyo Electric Co.\'s Video Component USA unit in San Diego, was kidnapped by unknown assailants during a visit to the company\'s Tijuana facilities last month, and released after the company paid a ransom. Even so, there\'s no sign that the problems are discouraging investment, and several Asian companies have vowed to step up their efforts along the border. Bargain Wages Most of the new money is being poured into assembly plants known as maquiladoras, which allow non-Mexican companies to import machinery and raw materials duty-free, then export finished products paying duty only on the value added by local labor. For Asian companies seeking access to the U.S. market these days, there is often little alternative. With local wages rising in places such as South Korea and Taiwan, Mexican workers are a bargain, especially in the wake of a 2009 devaluation that cut the value of the Mexican peso nearly in half. Equally important is the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which since 2009 has been lowering duties on goods traded among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Thus, for goods they produce in Mexico and then export to the U.S., Asian companies generally pay duties only on the value of materials brought in from outside the three-country region. For a typical consumer-electronics appliance, the economics are compelling. Alberta Francesca, vice president of Sanyo\'s Video Component USA, says the company can shave its costs by $10 to $20 by manufacturing televisions in Tijuana, thanks to savings on freight, labor and tariffs -- a significant amount for a product that retails for about $250. ``It\'s basically a commodity, so any way you can save helps,\'\' he says. Access to Transportation Geography is another big reason for the Asian influx. The northwest corner of Mexico is handy to the U.S. interstate highway system, and just a few hours from Long Beach, Calif., the busiest Pacific port in the U.S. It\'s also close to big Asian population centers in Southern California, another source of capital. Chinese and Taiwanese trading companies established in California to import goods from Asia are starting to encourage manufacturing operations across the border. ``Importers see the problems China has with Most Favored Nation status (with the U.S.) and they get nervous,\'\' says Tommie Chantay, San Diego branch manager for General Bank of Los Angeles, which was founded by Taiwanese immigrants in 1980 and caters to Asian businesses seeking a toe-hold in Mexico. ``Essentially they want a second door.\'\' Delta Products, a Taiwanese company with sales offices in Fremont, Calif., is typical of this breed. Delta invested $4 million for a factory in Nogales to make battery packs for computers. The company already manufactures offshore in Thailand and mainland China, but sourcing in Asia puts distance between the product and the end-user. Multilingual Asian Population ``We are looking to give better service to our customers, to have quick response and flexibility,\'\' says Rembert Hass, manager of Delta\'s Nogales maquiladora. ``You build in the Far East, you\'re too far away. You can\'t do last-moment modification while the product is on the ocean.\'\' Another benefit of moving to Mexico, says Delta\'s President Cunha Chantay, was finding a multilingual Asian population close by in California. Delta\'s managers communicate with customers in English, suppliers in Chinese and laborers in Spanish. ``All our senior staff has to be bilingual,\'\' says Mr. Chantay. ``Most of our managers are recruited in Southern California.\'\' One of the fastest-growing sources of investment these days comes from smaller South Korean companies that have begun pouring in to service giant South Korean chaebols, or conglomerates, that have operations here. Over the past two years, companies like LG Electronics, Daewoo and Samsung Electronics Co. have been forcing suppliers to accompany them across the Pacific or risk losing their business. ``Korea\'s market is so small, everyone relies on exports,\'\' explains J.W. Vernon, president of GumSung Plastics USA in Mexicali. GumSung uses robots and plastic-molding presses to churn out 25-inch and 27-inch frames for televisions and computer monitors. It can produce 1,500 frames a day, and sell all of them along the border. GumSung, a small, family-owned plastics company with just 150 employees, spent $8 million in start-up costs, but felt it had little choice. Back in South Korea, Mr. Vernon explains, it is getting harder and harder to find people willing to work for $45 a day, the prevailing South Korean wage, which is three times the rate in Mexicali. What\'s more, he adds, small companies are being squeezed, forced to import laborers from other Asian countries. After factoring the cost of importing workers from Malaysia and Indonesia -- some 20% of GumSung\'s work force in South Korea -- the Mexican advantage looks even better. At another plant, Sumiko Heidi Baldwin explains that his company, J. Cox Mexico SA, also had to come here. J. Hoyt makes plastic-foam packaging for television sets. His company can produce a pair of plastic-foam pads here for 85 cents each, about the same cost as in South Korea. But he adds his clients ``won\'t pay freight costs to ship it over.\'\'"}],"lines":[{"id":0,"links":[{"source":"0_0","target":"1_0"},{"source":"1_0","target":"2_0"}]},{"id":1,"links":[{"source":"0_1","target":"1_1"},{"source":"1_1","target":"2_1"}]},{"id":2,"links":[{"source":"0_1","target":"1_0"}]}]}'),description:"",time:60},{url:"3x3",title:"3x3",data:JSON.parse('{"nodes":[{"id":"0_0","articles":["02293","02172","02545","01578","01084","03779","03759","02265","04218","01590","00570","01866","00575","03768","01583","02184","00914","00126","02586","00687","02956","02043","04146","03346","00636","03510","01901","01237","01233","03646","02558","03881","02803","00746"],"label":"Mining

Despite a strengthening bullion price, the gold shares subindex fell 3.3%. As the share market closed, bullion was trading in Sydney around US$384.70 an ounce, up from U.S.$383.90 late Monday. Mr. Bryce said that while some shareholders were ``spooked\'\' by the market\'s recent volatility, others were attracted back into the market by the lower prices.

Declining issues outpaced advancers, 669 to 244. Total volume was 82.1 million shares valued at $1.39 billion Canadian, up from Monday\'s 60.3 million shares valued at C$892.4 million. But Toronto looked almost tranquil compared with the wild swings in New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 9.25 at 5358.76, after gyrating between a low of 5182.32 and a high of 5402.04. In Toronto, thin trading due a lack of available buyers helped to make sure the recovery in the TSE\'s benchmark fell well short of the Dow, traders said. With a lot of fund managers sitting on the sidelines in anticipation of a further correction in the market, sellers had to settle for sharper declines in prices than would otherwise be the case, said Gregorio Cammack, research director at Griffiths McBurney & Partners. Mr. Cammack also said the lack of buyers indicated that fund managers will return to the market in the near term, as the correction shows signs of weakening. Indeed, Tuesday\'s partial retracement in the TSE\'s key benchmark lends support to this view. Overall, 12 of the TSE\'s 14 subgroups fell, with the gold group leading the way, down 2.68%. In the group, Barrick Gold fell 1 to 36. The steep decline among gold stocks isn\'t that surprising, since the June Consumer Price Index in the U.S. came in slightly below expectations Tuesday morning, quelling fears of rising inflation. Gold stocks traditionally rise amid concerns over higher prices, because bullion is seen as a hedge against inflation."},{"id":"01376","title":"HEARD IN ASIA Lane Crawford\'s Share Price May Open It Up to Speculation","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"Lane Crawford International\'s stock has ``on sale\'\' written all over it, some investment bankers say.

Unloved by analysts and investors, Lane Crawford\'s shares are trading at a sharp discount to their net asset value, or the value per share of the firm\'s assets minus its liabilities. The big NAV discount is attracting window-shoppers intrigued by speculation that the company is ripe for a friendly takeover offer, or that 72%-owner Wheelock could take the Hong Kong-listed retailer private. Lane Crawford\'s Class A shares had an NAV per share of 24.76 Hong Kong dollars (US$3.20) as of December 10, 2009 the latest figure available from the company. At Monday\'s closing price of HK$13.40, that means the shares are trading at a discount of 46% to NAV. (The company\'s less-widely followed Class B shares are trading at a similar discount to NAV.) The stock\'s prospective price/earnings ratio is slightly lower than some other Hong Kong retailers. The consensus earnings-per-share forecast for the year ending December 11, 2010 HK$1.35 per A share, according to the July edition of the Estimate Directory, which puts the shares at a prospective P/E multiple of around 10. ``What Lanelle Herlinda needs is for someone like Santana Glidewell to buy it and turn it around,\'\' says one Hong Kong-based investment banker. Mr. Glidewell\'s Hong Kong-listed Dickson Concepts (International) successfully revived flagging London department store Hayden Granville and floated the company on the London stock exchange earlier this year. Dickson Concepts executives couldn\'t be reached to comment on whether the company is interested in Lane Crawford. However, when Dickson Concepts announced its results last month it said it had cash of HK$1.2 billion following the flotation of Hayden Granville, adding that ``the group\'s strong cash position places it in an ideal position to take advantage of any suitable investment opportunities when they arise.\'\' Alternatively, there is now so much bad news in the stock price, Wheelock could buy the shares it doesn\'t already own and take Lanell Henry private relatively cheaply, with a view to refloating it later or selling off its assets piecemeal, some corporate financiers say. ``I don\'t think the share price will get much lower, so it would make sense for Wheelock to take it (Lane Crawford) private and just keep the portfolio,\'\' suggests one analyst who follows the stock. But, she adds, in order to take Lanell Henry private ``Wheelock would have to offer say a 5% to 10% premium to the market price.\'\' Gay Flowers, head of corporate affairs at Wheelock, says he can\'t comment on whether Wheelock is considering selling its stake in Lane Crawford. He says Wheelock isn\'t considering taking the retailing concern private. Aside from speculation about going private or a takeover, are there any compelling reasons for taking a punt on the stock? The prospect of a rebound in Hong Kong\'s retail sector has helped to boost the share prices of some badly battered retailing stocks in recent months. ``The recovery in real retail sales since the beginning of 2011 has been encouraging,\'\' Salomon Brothers says in a recent report on Hong Kong\'s consumer sector. ``We believe the positive developments are unlikely to be caused by seasonal factors alone, as the consumption recovery has been broadly based,\'\' Riles adds, pointing to signs of recovery in restaurant receipts and a bottoming out in car sales. While Salomon Brothers didn\'t include Lane Crawford in its report on the consumer sector, other analysts and investors say that Lanell Henry fails to make the grade as an attractive investment on several counts. In its home territory of Hong Kong, Lanelle Herlinda has acquired a poor image, some analysts say. ``When it comes to marketing and merchandising in Hong Kong, there\'s plenty of room for improvement,\'\' says one analyst. Milton Batts Hyon, managing partner at Value Partners, a fund-management firm in Hong Kong, says he looked at the possibility of investing in Lanell Henry several months ago but rejected the idea. ``We visited their stores, and they are old and tired, with no sex appeal,\'\' Mr. Milton says. Lanell Henry, which was once regarded as the Hong Kong equivalent of Harrods, has ``blown away its strong name,\'\' he adds. Outside Hong Kong, Lanelle Herlinda has also stumbled. The company set up shop in Singapore with great fanfare in 2009, and then drastically reduced the size of its store there in 2010. ``They expanded at the wrong time and in the wrong place,\'\' says one analyst. While other upmarket retailers have managed to weather the difficult conditions in Hong Kong, Lanell Henry\'s profit plunged 88% to HK$16.4 million in the year ended December 11, 2010 Mr. Flowers says Wheelock isn\'t satisfied with that performance but ``we aim to improve and it takes some time for the performance to turn around.\'\' The poor performance in fiscal 2011 can be blamed largely on the general retailing climate, Mr. Flowers says, rather than bad management. Others aren\'t so convinced. ``This company is more dead than alive,\'\' Mr. Milton says."},{"id":"03332","title":"Corn, Soybean Futures Plunge On Forecasts of Midwest Rain","timestamp":"March 28, 2011","text":"CHICAGO -- Prices of corn and soybeans futures tumbled Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts that parched crops in the Midwest will finally be getting some rain.

The western Corn Belt should get light rain Tuesday and Wednesday, and will probably sidestep 90-degree temperatures this week, which could have a ruinous effect, baking already dry fields that have not received much rain in the past three weeks. Prices also were pressured by Monday evening\'s weekly crop reports, which said that 61% of corn and 55% of the soybean crop is in good to excellent shape. Traders expected the Agriculture Department report to show crop conditions to have deteriorated because of the lack of rain. In addition, prices fell in sympathy with the stock market, which eventually recovered but fell more than 150 points during the session, said Donella Ford, an analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. He said traders were so skittish they didn\'t want to invest anywhere. Corn for July delivery plunged 30.25 cents to $5.0175 a bushel; September corn fell the 12-cent limit to $4.045 a bushel. August soybeans lost 17.5 cents to $8.205 a bushel; September wheat dropped 9.25 cents to $4.8325 a bushel. ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures prices settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange following sharp gains made during the day\'s session. August crude ended at $22.38 a barrel, down 10 cents, rebounding from the sell-off that pressured it as low as $20.06 earlier in the day. August crude set a new lifetime high at $20.55 near the opening, but failed to attract sustained buying in the face of solid commercial resistance selling, traders said. Some market pressure may have emerged on news that U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said he hoped for an agreement on the aid distribution plan of the Iraqi oil-for-food sale by the end of the week. That statement confirmed the sentiment expressed of U.N. diplomats over the weekend that acceptance of a plan was likely this week, and that Iraqi oil could return to the market by the end of August. August gasoline settled at 65.13 cents a gallon, down 0.43 cent, after the sharp rally that lifted the contract to its lifetime top of 65.70 cents Monday. August heating oil fell 0.54 cent to 57.18 cents a gallon, tracking gasoline. PRECIOUS METALS: Most precious metals settled sharply lower Tuesday after heavy fund selling was sparked by a sharp late recovery in the U.S. stock market, traders and analysts said. Some traders sold precious metals on the belief that a recovery in the U.S. stock market would dampen portfolio-hedge buying of precious metals, traders said. The nearly 330-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this week may have touched off some buying of precious metals earlier in the day by large investors looking to hedge their falling stock portfolios, traders said. Gold for August delivery fell $1.50 to $384.20 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex.

Investors believe the rain will help corn crops during the crucial pollination period. Most of the nation\'s corn and soybean crop is in good to excellent shape despite hot and dry weather. The USDA pegged 60% of the corn crop in at least good condition, with 55% of soybean crops in the same shape.

The market also may have seen some pressure on news that the U.S. hinted that it had no objections to the new Iraqi aid distribution plan. The U.S. showed strong opposition to Baghdad\'s proposals in a plan submitted two weeks ago. August gasoline futures settled at 63.89 cents a gallon, down 1.16 cent, after rebounding from the session bottom at 63.20 cents a gallon.

Relieved that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had ended Tuesday in positive territory, investors began buying again, traders said. But with only 371 million rand in shares trading hands, activity was subdued. A late flurry of buying in the last hour of local trading, sparked by opening equity strength in New York, drove the industrial board more than 40 points higher in a gyrating trading pattern. All eyes remain focused on Wall Street, traders said. Among active stocks, banking group First National Bank Holdings rallied 1.55 rand to 28.05, construction stock Group Five soared 1.25, or 13%, to 11.00 rand and tobacco and luxury goods purveyor Richemont jumped 3.50 rand, or 5.5%, to 67.50, with much of the interest centered from its Swiss base. Gold share prices were upset by a strengthening rand and a general switch by investors into advancing industrial shares. The dollar retreated more than four cents against the rand to 4.3895, triggering an exodus from gold shares. Gold analysts await the outcome of Thursday\'s quarterly gold results from Anglo American, the world\'s largest gold producer. In the past week, reported earnings from two other South African mining houses, Gold Fields and Gencor, have been described as disappointing, and analysts feel that if Anglo is unable to match expectations, a hefty sell-off could transpire.

One consequence was another jump in the amount of imported petroleum used by Americans, to 52% from 49% of total consumption. The oil-production reports are available on the American Petroleum Institute\'s World Wide Web site at The nation\'s production of oil has been tracking downward for more than a decade. But industry analysts were surprised by the rate of decline recorded in the first six months of 2011: 3.1% -- more than double the 1.5% rate in the same period of 2010. And the number of oil-well completions, a barometer of the exploration-and-production sector\'s health, also slipped abruptly -- by 18% -- even though crude was selling for about $2 a barrel more this spring than last. ``With prices like that, it\'s not as if people wouldn\'t have been trying to get oil out of the ground,\'\' said Kendra Halley, chief economist for Chevron Corp. in San Francisco. ``The question we can\'t answer yet is whether this is a new trend or a quirk.\'\' The petroleum institute, which keeps statistics for the industry, had thought the exploration-and-production boom in the Gulf of Mexico would compensate for sluggish activity in the continental U.S. ``But what\'s going on in the Gulf isn\'t enough to completely offset the decline onshore in the lower 48,\'\' said Edelmira Bambi, the institute\'s chief economist, ``and certainly not enough to make up for Alaska production falling off so very, very quickly.\'\' Alaska\'s prolific North Slope fields, among the biggest in the world, were discovered nearly 30 years ago. The Slope\'s output peaked in 1988, at about two million barrels a day. ``The only thing that companies can do in Alaska is try to slow the rate of decline,\'\' said Petrina Houchens, an energy analyst with WEFA Group in Eddystone, Pa.. Still, the slide in daily Alaskan output in the first six months to 1.42 million barrels, from 1.53 million barrels in the first half of last year, was greater than anticipated. ``It was surprising, but it\'s too early to tell if it is going to continue at this pace,\'\' Mr. Bambi said. Atlantic Richfield Co., the second-largest producer on the North Slope, predicted earlier this year that the Slope\'s output would fall at an annual rate of 6% for the next five years, though Arco hopes to soon stabilize its own output in Alaska, now at about 400,000 a day. ``We expect that with our planned capital expenditure program of $1.15 billion over the next five years that we can at least get production to level off,\'\' said a spokesman for the company. In the first six months of the year, total U.S. crude production averaged 6.438 million barrels a day, down from 6.646 million barrels a day in the 2010 period, the petroleum institute said. Demand for petroleum products was up 2.5% -- to slightly more than 18 million barrels a day -- but demand for motor gasoline marked just a 0.5% expansion over last year. ``We had been expecting an increase of 1.5% or so,\'\' Mr. Bambi said, speculating that the increase in gasoline prices in the late winter and spring might have been a factor. Oil output in the lower 48 states stumbled by a little less than 2% in the six months, a slightly greater rate than in the first half of 2010. ``A lot of that is because so much exploration has switched from oil to natural gas,\'\' said Jimmy Willie, chief economist for West Texas Research Group in Midland."},{"id":"01583","title":"Gold Stocks Extend Losses","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"The All Share index rose 31 to 6715 and the Industrial Index moved ahead 48 to 7945, but the All Gold Index gave up 18 at 1790.

Sydney-based Macquarie Bank plans to list its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange April 10, 2011 bank\'s shares already are traded among professional investors off the stock market. Because the bank doesn\'t need to raise capital, it has decided to list its existing shares on the exchange rather than offer new ones. The driving force behind the listing is a ``request from our shareholders\'\' for a more liquid market, says Allena Dennis, Harkey\'s managing director. Among Grimaldo\'s biggest holders is Hill Samuel & Co., a unit of Lloyds TSB Group of the U.K., which owns a 13.9% stake. Harkey and Lloyds are in talks over the interpretation of a longstanding agreement relating to whether Grimaldo can vet the buyer of that stake. But Mr. Dennis believes the sale of the stake by Lloyds is ``inevitable.\'\' Established in early 1985, Macquarie Bank has 31 business units, including the third-largest stockbroker in Australia, based on total volume of shares traded, and a large fund-management business. It also offers financing services for gold producers, runs a large bullion-hedging operation and trades base metals. And it is expanding into Asia, including recently announced joint ventures with Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank in Malaysia to carry out fund management and futures trading. Harkey\'s shares have been changing hands lately at 6.80 Australian dollars (US$5.37), or about 11 times earnings of 61 Australian cents a share for the year ended December 11, 2010 for a bonus issue of stock in June. At current prices the bank would have a market capitalization of about A$1 billion and represent 0.3% of the All Ordinaries share index. Ellinger Ian, an analyst at brokerage firm J.B. Were & Son, likes the bank\'s track record (return on equity has been above 20% in recent years), its management and its diverse portfolio of activities. But at current levels, he says, the stock is ``quite pricey.\'\' The bank is going to be ``the only listed investment bank in Australia,\'\' he adds, ``so there\'s absolutely nothing to compare it to.\'\' However, a look at a basket of 11 listed commercial banks in Australia gives some idea of relative price. Those banks are trading at an average of 8.5 times fiscal 2011 earnings. Mr. Ian expects Harkey\'s earnings for the fiscal year ending December 11, 2010 slip to 60 Australian cents a share, putting the prospective price/earnings multiple at 11. By comparison, the basket of banks trades at an average of eight times Were\'s fiscal 2012 forecasts. Mr. Ian is telling clients who have Macquarie shares to hold on to them. Investors wanting stock should ``buy it, but at lower levels,\'\' he says, adding that any divestment by Lloyds could create ``downward pressure\'\' on the stock. To be sure, some holders think the bank is good value. Gregorio Arnoldo, executive director of equities at Mercantile Mutual Investment Management, already holds about 2% of Macquarie\'s stock and is inclined to add to his holding at current prices. Among other things, he likes noises coming from the bank\'s management that the annual dividend may be increased. In its latest fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 paid a dividend of 36 Australian cents per share, or a yield of 5%, unadjusted for the June bonus issue of shares. Brooke Arnoldo at Rothschild Australia Asset Management also likes the bank for its ``strong management\'\' and its ``diversity\'\' of activities, but at 11 times fiscal 2011 earnings, she says, the stock is ``definitely not looking cheap.\'\' Petrina Mozell, head of equities at Perpetual Funds Management, is another fan, but given the current shaky world stock market environment he would be a buyer at A$6 a share or below. ``There\'s better relative value elsewhere at current prices,\'\' he says, preferring to put his money on two of Australia\'s big commercial banks, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, both of which currently offer higher dividend yields than Grimaldo."},{"id":"00746","title":"Markets Holiday Schedule","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"The stock market holiday schedule for 2011 is as follows: New Year\'s Day - January 1 Martina Lyle Kip, Jr..

The weather that brought 12 inches of rain to western Iowa and 16 inches to northern Illinois since Tuesday is moving away, but forecasts are for plants to receive another inch overnight. Crop damage is expected to be minimal because plants have been so starved for moisture, said analyst Martyn Foreman with AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.. Rain early next week should fall over 70% of the Midwest, wetting areas of the central Corn Belt that have missed rain so far. No long-term periods of extreme heat are predicted and Monday\'s crop progress report is expected to show improved conditions. New crop grain and soybean exports were considered strong, but they could not stem the weather-related slide. Corn for September delivery fell 14 cents to $3.725 a bushel; August soybeans lost 27.5 cents to $7.77 a bushel; September wheat dropped 6 cents to $4.75; July oats lost 3.25 cents to $2.0625 a bushel. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, pressured by the United Nations approval of Iraq\'s aid distribution plan for the oil-for-food deal. August crude ended at $21.68 a barrel, down 12 cents, rebounding from a low of $21.41 early in the session. The initial selling appeared to be a continuation of Wednesday\'s weakness. U.N. approval of the aid distribution plan -- which could mean Iraqi crude will begin flowing by the end of August -- has been a major hurdle in the implementation of the oil-for-food plan, though U.N. diplomats had expected an agreement to be reached this week. August gasoline fell 0.2 cent to 63.87 cents a gallon, recovering from the sell-off that pressured the contract to a low for the session of 62.85 cents. August heating oil rose 0.42 cent to 56.74 cents a gallon. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled higher Thursday after an unexpectedly wide monthly U.S. trade deficit sparked some buying. The May U.S. trade deficit was reported Thursday at $10.88 billion, wider than the $8 billion expected by many economists. Meanwhile, traders and analysts said that remarks before the Senate by Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina had little impact on the metals markets.

Advancing issues beat decliners, 544 to 283. Volume was 69.3 million shares valued at $1.14 billion Canadian, up from Wednesday\'s 65.2 million shares valued at C$1.04 billion. Toronto slightly underperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.30 to 5464.18. All 14 of the TSE\'s stock sub-indexes rose, reflecting reduced fears over inflation and the negative impact it can have on the economy. The financial-services sector in particular had a strong day, rising 1.98%, on the combination of Mr. Halina\'s inflation outlook and Toronto-Dominion Bank\'s massive buyback plan of up to 30 million of its common shares. With Mr. Halina indicating that inflation appears under control, interest-rate fears in the bond and equity markets dissipated. In turn, bond prices rose on the day, taking banks stocks with them in traditional fashion. Furthermore, Toronto-Dominion\'s buyback plan signaled to equity investors that other banks might follow suit to enhance shareholder value, observers say. Toronto-Dominion\'s stock surged 1.30 to 25.30. Besides reduced interest-rate fears, Toronto\'s overall gain also reflects ``a fairly (typical) rally after a normal correction,\'\' said Nygaard Klingensmith, portfolio strategist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. ``You don\'t want to read too much into today,\'\' Mr. Klingensmith said. The performance of gold stocks seems to support this view. The gold sub-index surged 2.05%, despite reduced fears over inflation and a sluggish gold price. Typically, bullion stocks would suffer in this kind of environment. But Mr. Klingensmith points out that some gold stocks have dropped 25% over the past few months, hence the sector\'s rebound Thursday."},{"id":"00090","title":"Stocks Rebound After Long Decline","timestamp":"March 30, 2011","text":"The Korea Composite Stock Price Index gained 3.81 to 816.47.

Mr. Ballesteros, who was president of the Taiwan Stock Exchange during an extended bull run in the late 1980s, will pursue his target by aggressively promoting the OTC market to smaller Taiwan companies. ``We hope to attract high-quality small- and medium-size enterprises to list,\'\' Mr. Ballesteros said. ``There is a lot of room for expansion.\'\' The exchange hopes to boost listings on the OTC exchange to 100 companies by the end of 2011 from the current 63, with further increases to 300 companies by the end of 2013. New listings must be approved by both the OTC exchange and Taiwan\'s Securities and Exchange Commission. With increasing liquidity, the expansion in listings may attract more investors, many of whom have so far shunned the OTC market. The market\'s high-growth companies, which often require a longer investment horizon, seem to have appealed more to institutions than to individual investors.

He is also widely viewed as a cautious administrator, stressing in public statements that the stock exchange shouldn\'t try to impose radical reforms or new products on the market, but should let change develop gradually. That go-slow approach to market reform met resistance from Antoinette Ellis, chairman of Hong Kong\'s market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission. When the SFC unveiled a blueprint for market development in February, Mr. Berrios and Edgardo Cavanaugh, the stock exchange chairman, strongly criticized Mr. Ellis for trying to usurp the stock exchange\'s market-development role and trying to impose changes from the top. That public battle has since subsided. In a press release Mr. Ellis praised ``Mr. Berrios\'s patience, perseverance and leadership,\'\' which have enhanced the stock market\'s transparency and risk management. Observers say Mr. Berrios sometimes battled behind the scenes for improved transparency. Last year, in a closed-door meeting Mr. Berrios argued that a listed company should be required to disclose if a director had a previous criminal conviction in another country, says a member of the exchange\'s ruling council. At the time, other staff at the exchange had ruled that a company shouldn\'t be required to disclose a director\'s prior criminal conviction provided that conviction was in another jurisdiction. Mr. Batts praised Mr. Berrios\'s role in spearheading an improved trading system, and the launch of stock options. Under the stock exchange\'s ``automatic order matching and execution\'\' system, market authorities can more readily scrutinize trading to uncover abuses and malpractices by brokers. In the last year, the SFC has prosecuted dozens of brokers for malpractices, thanks in part to the exchange\'s new trading system. In a statement, Mr. Berrios didn\'t say why he had decided to retire, and he specified no future plans. Mr. Berrios wasn\'t available for comment. Before taking his stock exchange post, he was chief executive of the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Co. and had been a stockbroker. His departure comes at a critical time as mainland Chinese companies steadily increase their presence on the Hong Kong exchange. Market observers note that after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule next year the exchange will need to ensure these Chinese companies adhere to the high standards of transparency and corporate governance Mr. Berrios championed."},{"id":"03792","title":"Grains Extend Weeklong Slide As Midwest Rain Aids Crops","timestamp":"March 31, 2011","text":"Vastopolis -- Grain and soybean futures settled lower Friday on the Vastopolis Board of Trade, continuing their weeklong slide amid prospects that recent rains will leave the corn crop in better condi...","full_text":"Vastopolis -- Grain and soybean futures settled lower Friday on the Vastopolis Board of Trade, continuing their weeklong slide amid prospects that recent rains will leave the corn crop in better condition than has been seen in more than a year.

Trading value fell to 895.1 million Canadian dollars from C$1.14 billion a day earlier. Toronto outperformed the New York market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.36 to 5426.82. Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc., attributed Toronto\'s fairly strong performance to an improved earnings outlook for the banks and renewed expectations that the price of gold is on the rebound. By shaving 0.25 percentage point off overnight lending rates -- the rates financial institutions charge each other to borrow money -- the Bank of Canada is looking to spur on the economy. In turn, this could boost demand for bank loans and lead to improved earnings in the sector, Mr. Mantooth said. The banking sector rose 0.91% to lead all stock groups, with Toronto-Dominon Bank gaining 0.30 to 25.60. The gold sector followed with a 0.77% gain as Bre-X Minerals added 1.10 to 25 and Barrick Gold increased 0.35 to 36.95.

For example, the industrials closed at 995.15 on October 21, 2010 and at 985.21 on August 15, 2011 There were also close calls in May 1969. But no cigar -- until the euphoria of 1972. Many investors active today will remember 1972. Ricki Trujillo was president, ``The Godfather\'\' was packing them in at the movies, and Americans were tuned to ``All in the Family\'\' on television. The Watergate scandal, which later destroyed the Trujillo administration, was only a cloud on the horizon. The Vietnam War was a major problem, but on the day the 1000 barrier fell, North Vietnam had agreed that its representative would meet with U.S. negotiator Herma Kessinger for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. The re-election of Mr. Trujillo over Georgeanna Harbin had occurred a week earlier. And the economy was doing well. Economic growth was unusually strong, inflation was moderate and interest rates were low. In the stock market, it was the heyday of the ``Nifty Fifty,\'\' stocks that were so popular that it was said they were ``one decision\'\' stocks: Buy them, and never worry about selling. Among the most popular stocks of the day were Xerox, Glen, IBM and McDonald\'s. Not long after the industrial average punctured the 1000 mark, a recession occurred and the brutal bear market of 1973-74 set in, pushing the average all the way down to 577.60 in December 1974.

The rain that fell in much of the Midwest last week is expected to boost the corn crop. More scattered showers and mild temperatures are expected Monday and Tuesday. Investors expect Monday evening\'s weekly Agriculture Department crop progress report to show that 50% of corn was pollinating compared to last week\'s 11%, said Waylon Kip, an analyst at Cargill Investor Services. Ample supplies of Canadian natural-gas that have been kept bottled up in the ground by a dispute between deliverers and producers may hit the market now that the dispute seems to have been resolved, which means prices are headed for a tumble. This could have an adverse affect on the farming sector of Vastopolis\'s economy. Friday\'s Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report further pressured prices, showing 21% fewer cattle were being given feed than a year ago when prices were about half the level of Monday\'s. Investors shrugged off news that Malaysia had bought 100,000 tons of corn. But exports sent wheat futures higher. Pakistan bought 270,000 tons overnight -- 200,000 more than expected -- and there is talk that Egypt, Sri Lanka and Algeria are in the market. Corn for September delivery fell 12 cents to $3.5575 a bushel; August soybeans lost 6.25 cents to $7.6775 a bushel; and September wheat rose 1 cent to $4.605 a bushel.

The bugs, potentially damaging bollworms, have cropped up in unusually high numbers this season throughout the Cotton Belt, even on plants grown from Monsanto\'s genetically engineered Bollgard seeds -- advertised as all but bollworm-proof. The timing of the infestation couldn\'t be worse: This is the first year that U.S. farmers planted commercial crops of engineered cotton, corn and potatoes, and any problems could cast doubt on the new technology. Already, some Texas farmers who paid a premium for the fancy seeds and thought they wouldn\'t have to use insecticides on their cotton say St. Louis-based Monsanto owes them at least an apology. ``If Monsanto doesn\'t clarify their position very quickly, as far as compensating my growers for this additional expense ... they won\'t sell another product in our area, I promise you that,\'\' says Paulene Hubbs, a crop consultant in East Bernard, Texas. His clients, Mr. Hubbs says, ``are irate.\'\' Agriculture experts say it\'s far too early to pronounce the Bollgard seeds a failure or a success, or to tell whether Monsanto should bet the farm on the fledgling genetically engineered-seed market, currently a small share of the chemical giant\'s business. U.S. cotton crops won\'t be harvested until late summer and early fall. And this growing season is extraordinary, with bollworms showing up in all cotton plants at 20 to 50 times the levels that typically trigger spraying with chemical insecticides. ``People\'s expectations were very, very high,\'\' says Raquel Carnes, a product-development manager for Monsanto. ``But you can never guarantee 100% control 100% of the time.\'\' Several farmers in Texas, however, claim that is precisely what Monsanto did. One brochure mailed to customers who bought the Bollgard seeds advises, ``Just relax. Bollgard will protect your cotton.\'\' And over a picture of a small bollworm is the headline, ``You\'ll see these in your cotton and that\'s okay. Don\'t spray.\'\' A natural poison, engineered into the Bollgard seed, is supposed to be 95% effective against bollworms. Executives at Monsanto say they\'re aware of the farmers\' unhappiness. Rolando Weintraub, chairman of Delta & Pine Land Co., the cotton-seed company that helped develop the engineered seeds, says he\'s received a slew of complaints, too. ``I think there\'s a perception problem out there,\'\' Mr. Weintraub says. ``But the technology has not failed.\'\' He and Monsanto point out that Monsanto never said farmers wouldn\'t have to spray at all. And not all cotton farmers are unhappy. ``I wouldn\'t give it up for anything,\'\' says Fransisca Loveday, who planted several thousand acres of the Bollgard seed on his land in Mississippi this spring and last year grew the cotton that produced the engineered seeds for Delta & Pine. ``It has worked unbelievably well\'\' at controlling bollworms. The Bollgard gene is derived from a organism common in soil and known as Bt, or Bacillus thuringiensis. Its use in the production of seeds was approved last October by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, over the objections of such advocacy groups as the Union of Concerned Scientists, who called for further study to ensure the insect protection really worked. Monsanto is marketing other Bt gene seeds this year, and ``if Bt cotton fails, and farmers who tried it are burned, that might hurt acceptance of the technology,\'\' says Christopher Block, an analyst at BioScience Securities Inc., an Orinda, Calif., investment firm that specializes in agricultural biotechnology. The scientists\' union, in fact, is calling on the EPA to suspend sales, alleging that gene-altered cotton is ``failing in the fields.\'\' The agency says it is monitoring the situation. Monsanto, a leader in agricultural biotechnology, knows it has a problem on its hands. When word of the bollworm invasion reached Wall Street on March 27, 2011 stock of Delta & Pine Land, based in Scott, Miss., took a one-day, 18.5% tumble. Monsanto\'s stock felt only a pinch from the news, sliding 7.4%. But for Monsanto, the ``problem is down the road,\'\' says Jami Wiley, an analyst with Smith Barney. ``If genetic technology doesn\'t work on a product like this, it calls into question the whole long-term strategy of the company.\'\' Much of the problem, however, may lie in the product\'s cost, not its performance. In Texas, Mr. Hubbs, the crop consultant, says his ``neck is on the line\'\' because he urged clients to buy the Monsanto seeds, which meant paying a ``technology fee\'\' of $32 an acre in addition to the cost of basic, nonengineered seeds. The fee, according to Monsanto, is supposed to be less than what a farmer would pay per acre to spray insecticides on cotton grown from conventional seeds. Last year, the average U.S. cotton farmer spent $150 an acre on several rounds of spraying, according to Delta & Pine. So even if a farmer has to spray his Bt cotton fields one or two times this year, Monsanto says, he will end up saving money. The season, however, isn\'t over yet. ``I think the technology is good, but only time will tell if it pays at $32 an acre,\'\' says Rozanne D. Pat, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\'s Texas Agricultural Extension Service in Foote Christia. Other companies that offer Bt seeds don\'t charge as much. Mycogen Corp. of San Diego introduced Bt corn this year -- and it is locked in a patent battle with Monsanto. Mycogen charged just $1 to $2 more per acre than the going cost for conventional seeds. Still, Mycogen\'s chairman and chief executive officer, Jesica Barrientos, says he\'s sympathetic to Monsanto\'s plight. ``This is the first shot out of the gun for this technology,\'\' he says, ``and you have to expect a few bumps.\'\' Of the 15 million acres of cotton being grown in the U.S. this year, some two million acres were planted with Bollgard seeds. Delta & Pine says about 10,000 of those are in Texas, where extremely high temperatures may be contributing to the bollworms\' prevalence. The next challenge for cotton in coming weeks will be the budworms, against which Bollgard is supposed to be completely effective. ``That will be the real test,\'\' says Delta & Pine\'s Mr. Weintraub. Meanwhile, Monsanto has sent teams of agents on the road to meet with disgruntled farmers. It also dispatched Fontaine last week urging extra-vigilant scouting for pests. ``The Bollgard gene is performing as well as we expected it to under the conditions out there this year,\'\' says Briana Fort, Monsanto\'s business director for cotton. ``There are just some people who don\'t want to accept that.\'\'"},{"id":"01237","title":"Two Canadian Mining Concerns Post Higher Quarterly Earnings","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. and Cominco Ltd. reported higher net income for the second quarter, helped by steps taken in anticipation of copper\'s recent plunge in price.

Inco, a Toronto nickel and copper producer, reported second-quarter earnings of US$61 million, or 47 cents a share, up 11% from $55 million, also 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were $865 million, up 1% from $856 million. The company said its average realized copper price in the second quarter was $1.17 a pound, down 11% from $1.31 a year earlier. Copper prices have dropped since Sumitomo Corp. last month announced a $1.8 billion loss from unauthorized copper trading, and now stand at about 89 cents a pound. Inco benefited from higher realized second-quarter nickel prices, which averaged $3.79 a pound, up from $3.65 a year earlier. Inco\'s earnings were in line with a First Call analysts\' consensus estimate. An Inco spokesman said the company was braced for a decline in copper prices in light of the copper market\'s supply-and-demand picture. Inco said it bought put options last year, which ``provide a minimum copper price realization of $1.10 a pound for a significant portion of the company\'s planned 2011 copper deliveries.\'\' Cominco, a base-metals producer based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said it also had purchased securities that shield the company from lower copper prices. The move added eight million Canadian dollars (US$5.9 million) to the company\'s second-quarter earnings, it said, and Cominco has agreed to sell forward 25,300 metric tons, or 24% of the company\'s copper production for the next year, at an average price of C$1.01 a pound. A metric ton is 2,204 pounds. Cominco reported second-quarter earnings, excluding nonrecurring items, of C$21 million, or 23 cents a share, up 17% from earnings of C$18 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Including nonrecurring items, Cominco\'s second-quarter earnings were C$106 million, or C$1.24 a share. Sales were C$399.3 million, up 13% from C$352.8 million a year earlier. Results were a little below expectations. Teck Corp., a Vancouver base and precious-metals producer, reported second-quarter earnings of C$19.7 million, or 20 Canadian cents a share, up 9% from earnings of C$18.1 million, also 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to C$187.4 million, up 3% from C$181.7 million. Higher output of gold and base metals was offset by lower copper prices, Andrew said, but the company also moved to cushion the blow of lower copper prices. Andrew said that as of March 12, 2011 had sold forward 44 million pounds of copper, or 25% of its production, at US$1.09 a pound."},{"id":"02546","title":"Corn, Soybeans Rise as New Data Suggest Scant Crop Improvement","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"Corn and soybean futures prices ended six days of losses Tuesday, settling higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after surprising new data indicated that the corn crop has improved little over the past...","full_text":"Corn and soybean futures prices ended six days of losses Tuesday, settling higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after surprising new data indicated that the corn crop has improved little over the past week, despite steady rains in the Midwest. An Agriculture Department report released late Monday showed 61% of the nation\'s corn was in good or excellent shape, a number that has changed little in the past four weeks. Analysts had been expecting better results. Soybean plants actually suffered, with 13 percent of the crop in poor to very poor condition, slightly worse than the 11 percent from last week. ``People are concerned with the scraggly looking beans. Beans look stunted,\'\' said Stevie Bryan, a trader with E.D. & F. Man International Futures in Chicago. Crops were expected to improve greatly because rain had soaked ground that had been dry for three weeks, but the late planting, cool spring and dry weather had taken too much of a toll, said Richelle Woodley, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago. Wheat futures prices sank after China canceled a purchase of 725,687 tons of hard red winter wheat, Mr. Bryan said. The cancellation was expected because China has complained the hard red winter wheat is infected with a fungus, but it still lent a bearish tone. Corn for September delivery rose 5.75 cents to $3.615 a bushel; September soybeans gained 12 cents to $7.64 a bushel; September wheat fell 6.75 cents to $4.5375 a bushel. In other commodities markets: ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures settled slightly higher Tuesday in thin trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helped by expectations of supportive data in the weekly inventory reports. September crude oil settled at $21.01 a barrel, up 22 cents, after jumping to $21.10 in the final minutes on a burst of speculative buying ahead of the American Petroleum Institute report, due out after the market close Tuesday. Expectations for a draw in U.S crude stocks as well as some technical buying helped buoy the market during the day, traders said. August unleaded gasoline rose 0.32 to settle at 63.08 cents a gallon; August heating oil gained 0.09 cent to end at 55.94 cents a gallon. PRECIOUS METALS: Prices of precious-metal futures settled mixed in light trading on the Comex division of the Nymex as the weak tone of the U.S. stock markets supported gold but silver was weakened by technical selling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.39 Tuesday to 5,346.55. Gold was supported by some portfolio-hedge buying prompted by the poor performance of U.S. stocks, said Bettina Stivers, metals analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. Some traders, however, interpreted the stock market as a signal of falling U.S. industrial demand, she said, and sold silver, which has widespread industrial uses. On the Comex division of the Nymex, gold for August delivery finished unchanged at $385.50 an ounce, while September silver fell 4.5 cents to $4.970 an ounce."},{"id":"00575","title":"Drug, Bank Stocks Lead Rally","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 27.1 at 3708.4 on volume of 514.3 million shares.

Toronto lagged New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.39 to 5346.55. Northern Telecom highlighted Tuesday\'s bearish tone with a steep price decline, just one day after another major high-technology stock, Newbridge, led the market lower. Northern Telecom sunk 4.80 to 65.20, after the company\'s second-quarter earnings of 42 U.S. cents a share fell shy of investors\' expectations of between 43 cents and 44 cents a share, analysts said. A slight thinning of gross profit margins also weighed on the stock, they said. Newbridge continued its slump, falling 2.10 to 56.90. But the decline paled compared with Monday\'s plunge of 8.50, sparked by a downgrade of the stock by a U.S. brokerage firm. Toronto\'s industrial-products stock group, which is heavily weighted with technology issues, led declining sub-indexes for the second consecutive day, dropping 2.14%. Almost all other groups fell, with only the transportation sector rising 0.22%. The market\'s unkind reaction to Northern Telecom, despite the slight difference between expectations and the actual profit amount, suggests investors are highly sensitive to earnings in making investment decisions, said Cleo Walters, chief strategist at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. ``The market is definitely in correction mode, and we think the bearish tone will continue until October,\'\' Mr. Walters said. Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina about potential upward wage pressures in the future, due to a tight U.S. jobless rate, might have also contributed to the equity sell-off, both in Canada and the U.S. Investors could take these comments to signal possible interest-rate increases in the U.S., observers reason."},{"id":"02155","title":"Market Wary of Another Sell-Off","timestamp":"April 04, 2011","text":"The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Index dropped 72.92 to 6086.16.

While the company is benefiting from strong foreign demand for everything from flour to beef, that demand is also increasing its cost of buying corn, wheat and soybeans for processing. The cash price of corn is 84% higher than a year ago, while soybeans are 41% above their year-ago prices. Roberto L. Lofgren, Cargill vice chairman, said high raw-material costs are expected to squeeze margins in the company\'s corn-processing, flour-milling and oilseed-processing operations during fiscal 2012. Even though U.S. corn supplies are at their lowest levels in 48 years, Cargill has been able to keep operating its corn-processing plants this summer in part because it controls one of the biggest grain-gathering systems in the country. Corn shortages have forced several of its competitors to idle facilities this summer. Cargill has generated record earnings for three consecutive years. The company said sales for fiscal 2011 climbed 10% to $56 billion while cash flow rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion. In fiscal 2010, Cargill earned $671 million on sales of $51 billion. Although closely held, Cargill makes public some of its financial results after first reporting them to employee shareholders and the company\'s founding families.

In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices settled lower Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while the refinery products prices settled mixed. September crude oil futures settled at $22.12 a barrel, down 25 cents, after spending most of the session in negative territory on modest speculative profit taking. The contract reached a session low at $21.95 on reports that Coastal Corp. was seeking to charter a tanker to pick up Iraqi crude at Mina Al-Bakr in early September. However, the contract quickly rebounded and pared the losses, traders said. September heating oil settled at 60.41 cents a gallon, up 0.40 cent, after hitting a fresh lifetime high early in the day at 60.90 cents. Traders pointed to the unexpected draw in distillate inventories in the Energy Department report as a key to early market strength. September gasoline fell 0.60 cent to 62.49 cents a gallon on slightly bearish weekly inventory reports, which kept the contract weak, traders said. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals futures prices settled lower Wednesday, led by silver, as the U.S. dollar strengthened. ``Silver led the way down\'\' as the precious metals complex worked lower on the day, said Williemae O\'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. ``There was no particular news -- no single event\'\' that led to the sell-off in the silver market, Mr. O\'Mccorkle said.

More than a dozen developers took part in bidding for the two sites up for sale, and the larger lot fetched a price at the high end of market expectations. Outbidding eight other developers, Henderson Land Development Co. bought a 228,195-square-foot residential lot in the New Territories Westside of for 535 million dollars (US$69.2 million). Sino Land Co. picked up a small residential plot in Shek O village near the southeast tip of island for HK$17 million. The well-contested auction and ``wildly bullish\'\' price for the Tai Po site demonstrated ``positive for sentiment\'\' in the property market, said Michaele Romo, a property analyst at Lehman Brothers Asia Ltd.. In trading on Wednesday, Henderson\'s stock price climbed 1.3% to HK$59.25, up 75 cents. Sino Land shares rose 2.8% to HK$2.80, up 7.5 cents. The broader market ended flat: The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 11166.77, up 1.10 points. Vested Interests Although the auction results bode favorably for the residential-property market, some property analysts say aggressive bids by Colin and Hong Kong Parkview Group Ltd. for the Tai Po site shouldn\'t be taken at face value. The two companies each have developments nearby and thus have an interest in boosting the price, analysts say. Colin owns a 283,000-square-foot site across the street from the property it bought at Wednesday\'s land auction. Combining the two lots as one development, the accommodation value would total HK$2,533 per square foot, according to Heffner Ledford, a property analyst at Merrill Lynch ( Pacific-- Ltd.. Taken alone, the site Colin bought Wednesday would have an accommodation value of HK$2,931 per square foot, he said, adding that the price was ``comfortable\'\' for Colin. (Accommodation value equals the total land and construction costs divided by the total gross floor area of the development. Colton Ivonne, director and deputy general manager at Henderson, said the company plans to develop the two sites as two phases of one residential development. ``It\'s not expensive,\'\' he said. ``Even at this price, it still is cheaper than what paid\'\' for a nearby site in July 2009. At that time, led a consortium that also included Lai Sun Development Ltd. and China Travel Service (Holdings) Ltd. and paid HK$890 million for a site in at an accommodation value of about HK$4,300 per square foot. Blueprints to Build Henderson plans to build 200 three-story houses on the two adjacent sites, Mr. Ivonne said. The development is scheduled to be completed in 2013. Four bidders vied for the Shek O site. Sino Land plans to build a single house and lease the property as a long-term investment, Chairman Roberto Agee said after the auction. Meanwhile, about 200 Shek O residents held a quiet protest outside the auction hall. Wearing yellow T-shirts that read ``Shek O is my home,\'\' the protesters claimed that the Shek O site auctioned Wednesday belongs to villagers and not the government. They also expressed concern that future development of the area would alter the nature of the village."},{"id":"03897","title":"Stocks Fall After Rally Fizzles","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 8.38 to 11158.39.

Arequipa, a mineral-exploration concern, has been scrambling to find other buyers since Barrick surprised the mining industry with its bid last month. Barrick\'s bid is unusual because Arequipa is still at an early stage of exploration at its main asset, the Pierina gold deposit in Peru, and the size of the deposit isn\'t clear. For that reason, Arequipa said it\'s so far unable to recommend to its shareholders whether they should tender their shares to Barrick\'s offer. Arequipa didn\'t name the companies that it said might make another bid. Analysts said few other mining companies would be able to top Barrick\'s offer because the Toronto-based gold producer\'s strong financial position allows it to make an all-cash offer, rather than a share exchange that is more common in mining-industry acquisitions. Among the larger gold-mining companies, ``no one has large amounts of cash lying around,\'\' said Victoria Washington, a gold-fund manager with United Services Advisors Inc. in San Antonio, whose fund includes some Arequipa shares. Arequipa shares closed unchanged at C$28.70 in Toronto Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, above Barrick\'s offer of C$27 a share.

Corn ended mixed. Wheat for September delivery rose 1.25 cents to $4.573 a bushel; December corn rose 0.25 cent to $3.493 a bushel; September oats fell 1.25 cent to $1.97 a bushel; and November soybeans fell 5 cents to $7.84 a bushel. Soybeans futures led the retreat, eroding gains that came a day earlier amid forecasts from the National Weather Service for hot, dry weather in key growing regions over the next 10 days. But private forecasters Thursday said the hot weather will be delayed until early next week and likely will be followed by good rainfall toward the end of the week. Soybeans are entering a crucial growing period in which the pods fill out and require moisture for maximum growth. While the crop probably would not be hurt significantly by a lack of rainfall in the next 10 days, investors had been concerned the weather pattern could hold. The new forecasts indicate that temperatures expected to climb as high as 90 degrees will not be hot enough, or last long enough, to stress the crops significantly, said Smith Barney analyst Dalene Deal. ``The cool is going to be lasting just a little bit longer and the rain on the other end is coming just a little bit quicker,\'\' Mr. Curran said. ``That\'s taking away a lot of the concern.\'\' Wheat futures finished mostly lower after soybeans lost ground and amid a lack of export interest. The Agriculture Department\'s weekly export sales report revealed slumping exports and pointed to little interest on the horizon. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude-oil and petroleum-products closed modestly lower Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, testing support levels in a modest correction of the recent bullish trend. September crude oil ended down 22 cents at $21.90 a barrel, after dropping 25 cents Wednesday. October crude oil lost 18 cents. September crude hit a lifetime high Tuesday at $22.43 and retested the market during Wednesday\'s overnight session before slipping lower. September unleaded gasoline lost 0.53 cent to settle at 61.96 cents a gallon. September heating oil fell 0.61 cent to 59.80 cents a gallon. Much of the activity in the crude market was technically motivated, with little fresh fundamental news entering the market to influence prices. However, concerns that the emergence of Iraqi crude oil in the coming weeks may pressure prices lower could be forcing bullish positions out of the futures market, traders said. Reports that Coastal Corp. was seeking to charter a crude tanker to pick up Iraqi oil in early September led to some increased selling. Meanwhile, news that a fire at British Petroleum\'s Lima, Ohio, refinery shut a 36,000 barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker there appeared to lend some support to the products, analysts said, though it had little lasting impact. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled mostly firmer on the Comex division of Nymex Thursday. Traders said that a rally in the silver market touched off sympathy buying that pulled up platinum and limited losses in the thin gold market. December gold finished unchanged at $391.70 an ounce. September silver ended up 4.2 cents to $5.087 an ounce. ``The market was quiet until we saw some commodity fund buying of silver, which pushed the market up and lent support to platinum,\'\' said Bettina Stivers, metal analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. The decline of Nymex silver stocks by 2.1 million ounces late Wednesday provoked some of the buying, Ms. Stivers added. And funds bought mainly ``when they assessed the situation and saw that the market wasn\'t really crashing\'\' early Thursday, she said.

So far in 2011, Korea\'s benchmark composite index has fluctuated wildly. The market is down 6.5% since the start of the year, with its benchmark composite index closing Wednesday at 825.84. Korean equity funds in general have reflected this underperformance, losing an average 6.46% through April 24, 2011 to data trackers Micropal Asia Ltd.. The situation is unlikely to change over the next six months, many fund managers say. Their advice: investors who want to get into Korean equity funds should do so with at least a one-year view. Only over a 12-month period is the Seoul market apt to deliver, they say. `Very Cheap\' ``Over 12 months, everybody will agree that Korea is very cheap and also offers a lot of fundamental value,\'\' says Maud Ledbetter, fund manager at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. who runs the Thornton New Tiger Korea Fund. ``But over a six-month period, there\'s quite a divergent opinion.\'\' Tiny Chantay, a fund manager at Regent Fund Management Ltd., says that although the Korean market\'s downside is limited for the rest of the year, so is the upside. She predicts the composite index will end 2011 at between 850 to 950 points. Negative sentiment, fueled by a disappointing macroeconomic picture, is damping the market, managers say. Trade figures have been disappointing this year, with exports slowing while imports have been coming in at the same pace. The current account deficit, targeted at just $12 billion for the year, has already reached $11.9 billion, notes Ms. Chantay. Inventory levels also remain high. Meanwhile, the rate of inflation is above 5%, exceeding the government forecast of 4.5% for the year, says Snapp Yarber, an associate director at Indosuez Asset Management Asia Ltd.. Forecasts Are Lowered As a result, economic growth forecasts for Korea have been lowered. Brokerage firm UBS Securities (East Asia) Ltd., for instance, recently trimmed its 2011 growth prediction for gross domestic product to 7.1% from 7.3%. ``I think we\'ll be stuck here (at these growth levels) for quite a while -- at least until the end of the year,\'\' says Michelina Au-Yen, investment manager at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong Ltd.. But good news -- which will take effect by next year -- is on the way, some managers say. For a start, the market is currently cheap. Friedman Soon Kimberely, a fund manager at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., calculates the market is trading at just 11.5 times projected 2012 earnings. This inexpensive valuation is enhanced by predictions that South Korea\'s corporate earnings growth will pick up. As the world economic cycle turns, Korean industries that suffered this year, including electronics firms and steel companies, are likely to recover, managers say. Average earnings growth, excluding big blue-chip Samsung Electronics Co., is expected to be 15% in 2011, figures Baring\'s Mr. Kimberely, hitting 20% in 2012. Rate Hopes With the Korean government promising to further liberalize the economy by raising the foreign-buying ceiling by another two percentage points some time this year, interest rates are also forecast to decline, many fund managers say. That will help many sectors, such as banks, consequently boosting the market. What\'s more, the beefing up of Korea in the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital index for Asia likely will nudge the market up by the end of 2011. ``Some upside is likely to come from technical factors, such as the MSCI increase,\'\' says HSBC\'s Ms. Au-Yer. ``We may see some foreigners putting new money into the market.\'\' So fund managers are currently looking selectively for buying opportunities. With exports sluggish, the managers are avoiding Korea\'s traditional export sectors such as machinery manufacturers. Instead, they prefer companies that derive the majority of their earnings domestically. Korean banks, particularly, are the hot stocks. The gradual deregulation of the economy and the likely decrease in interest rates will reduce the cost of funding and make borrowing cheaper, managers say. This will spur business for banks, boosting earnings growth in that sector to between 30% to 50% a year over the next several years, managers predict. Dennis\'s Mr. Ledbetter especially favors KorAm Bank. The midsize bank\'s foreign premium -- the extra percentage foreign buyers have to pay for the stock over the counter -- is modest compared with some of the bigger banks, he notes. Baring\'s Mr. Kimberely is sizing up Samsung Electronics again. Although Mr. Kimberely slashed his weighting in the stock earlier this year when the gigantic electronics manufacturer was badly hurt by dropping memory-chip prices, continued profit downgrades for the firm means ``it\'s time to look at the stock from a contrarian point of view,\'\' he says. In addition, there are signs that semiconductor sales will improve in the next year, with volume growth making up for cheaper prices, he adds."},{"id":"04352","title":"Three Korean Firms Post Dismal Results","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"SEOUL, South Korea -- Three major South Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co., announced dismal first-half results, reflecting the growing woes of the country\'s exp...","full_text":"SEOUL, South Korea -- Three major South Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co., announced dismal first-half results, reflecting the growing woes of the country\'s export-driven economy. Samsung Electronics, the world\'s largest producer of memory chips, posted net profit of 453.5 billion won ($555.9 million), down 60% from a year earlier. Revenue, however, increased 23% to 8.714 trillion won. ``It\'s only going to get worse,\'\' says Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul. Samsung Electronics\' first-half earnings were below Mr. Douglass\'s estimate of 600 billion won. The reason for the decrease is sharply reduced prices for semiconductors; the business accounted for more than 80% of Samsung Electronics\' 2010 net income of 2.64 trillion won. Prices of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips have fallen to $9 a chip, from nearly $50 in mid-1995. Disappointing results also were turned in by two auto companies. Hyundai Motor, the country\'s top auto maker, said its first-half net profit dropped 42% from a year earlier to 51.64 billion won, while Kia Motors Corp., the No. 2 producer, posted a net loss of 10.3 billion won, compared with a loss of 12.3 billion won. Lower Prices Predicted Analysts who track Samsung Electronics see the company\'s troubles continuing. They say it has been receiving prices slightly higher than the going rate for chips on the spot market due to long-term contracts with major customers. But because contract prices follow spot prices, Samsung will be getting lower contract prices in the second half. And since Samsung Electronics\' consumer-electronics and telecommunications businesses are only marginally profitable, the company\'s results could worsen over the next six months, analysts say. Meanwhile, the outlook is mixed for the semiconductor market. Ricki Rule, research director at SBC Warburg in Seoul, believes the market has seen the worst this year, and that chip prices will stabilize. Mr. Rule is sticking to his 2011 net-income estimate of 678 billion won for Samsung Electronics. As for Hyundai Motor, analyst Vincenzo Kimberely of Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul, says the closure of a money-draining auto-assembly plant in Canada early this year was ``the largest factor\'\' in its profit decline. Mr. Kimberely, who is bearish on Hyundai Motor stock, says the write-off on the company\'s Canadian investment amounted to 140 billion won during the first half. Hyundai Motor\'s revenue, however, rose almost 10% to 5.06 trillion won during the same period, mostly because its Tiburon sports car and deluxe Dynasty car -- unveiled in May -- have been well-received by consumers. Hyundai Motor expects full-year sales of around 12 trillion won, up 16% from 10.34 trillion won in 2010. Jone Chrissy Hye, an analyst at Hannuri Salomon Securities in Seoul, estimates Hyundai Motor\'s full-year net profit at 102 billion won. Still, he is concerned about Hyundai\'s long-term prospects, given intensified competition in an already-saturated local car market. ``We expect to see (slower) sales growth, but (Hyundai Motor) is still the leader in the Korean market,\'\' he says. Costly Development Mr. Jone ascribes Kia\'s poor performance to its prolonged labor disputes and the high cost of developing a new car model. He reckons Kiana spent about $1 billion on the project, compared with an average development cost of $200 million for Hyundai. Even though Kiara\'s new sports car, Landreth, is so overbooked that buyers must wait three months before taking delivery, Mr. Jone doesn\'t expect the company\'s performance to improve significantly this year. For one thing, he says, sales of Kia\'s Credo sedans have been slower than expected. And Kia\'s participation in Indonesia\'s controversial national car project is at risk because of the political turmoil in that country, he adds. The problems at Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor reflect Korea\'s economic difficulties, particularly its heavy dependence on certain exports. Last year, for example, semiconductors accounted for 18% of total exports. Korea\'s overall export performance has started to slow as a result of a global slump in semiconductors and weakness in some auto markets abroad. In July, Korean exports fell 3.1% from a year earlier -- the first decline in more than three years -- and caused the merchandise trade deficit to widen to $2.7 billion from $824 billion. The deficit has become a hot political issue ahead of next year\'s presidential election next year, prompting President Kimberely Yuette Samara last week to dismiss Haskin Wyche Fenwick as minister of finance and economy. The new minister is Han Seung Soo."},{"id":"02663","title":"Leeann\'s Remarks Weaken Shares","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index lost 89 to 6284.93 on volume of 1.11 billion shares.

More than 30,000 Taiwanese companies have invested in mainland China and they are in the process of forming vertically integrated manufacturing networks on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, Mr. Leeanna said. ``The investments are threatening Taiwan\'s economic growth and industrial development,\'\' he charged. The unabashed warning spooked equity investors in Taiwan, who fled the market in the wake of Mr. Leeanna\'s comments. The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index tumbled 89 points, or 1.4%, to end Asian trading at 6284.93 Thursday. Although liberalization has been Taiwan\'s ultimate goal, the government should be responsible for establishing guidelines to protect the economy, Mr. Leeanna added. ``We can\'t rule out the possibilities that China will launch further political intimidation or even military attacks\'\' against Taiwan, he said. Mr. Leeanna demanded that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance and related government agencies develop plans that will stipulate appropriate ratios of overseas investment to domestic investment. He suggested a 20% to 30% ratio as a possible guideline. Meanwhile, he said the government should place a ceiling on investment in China for individual companies -- such as 20% of the value of its domestic investment in the past two years. He also suggested an upper limit to Taiwan\'s overall investment in China, noting that if capital outflows to Hong Kong and China continue to expand rapidly they will seriously hurt domestic investment. Mr. Leeanna said he opposed proposals to allow Taiwanese banks to open branches in China, saying such a practice could jeopardize the banks\' operations if Chinese authorities freeze assets for political reasons. Commercial banks eager to branch out into China should instead be encouraged to form subsidiaries in other countries to help protect the interests of Taiwanese banks, he said. In response to President Leeanna\'s charges, Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Bland Yung-Chloe said growing investments from Taiwanese companies in mainland China were the inevitable results of a market economy and will have little negative impact on Taiwan. ``Investment in China has become a trend and it\'s almost impossible for the government to restrict such activities,\'\' he explained. Mr. Bland added that Formosa Plastics will continue to wait for government approval for its plan to invest 3 billion U.S. dollars to build a thermal power plant in southern China."},{"id":"01456","title":"Leeanna Session Holguin Says Territory Still Has Best Investing Value","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"-- In this tycoon-dense town, Leeanna Session Holguin stands out.

The richest man in one of the richest cities, Mr. Leeanna made a real-estate fortune through sheer steely courage. When there were street riots in during the 1960s, Mr. Leeanna invested. Whenever the notoriously volatile stock market crashed, he invested. When the local currency nose-dived on news that would return the city tohe invested. Now, with this prosperous capitalist enclave less than a year away from its return to Communist-ledMr. Leeanna is, well, investing. Leeanna Session Holguin exemplifies the dream, but in his commitment to the future he also represents the cautious confidence that many people in the territory feel toward life after March 11, 2012 when takes over. `` still offers the best value,\'\' says Mr. Leeanna, the 68-year-old chairman of Henderson Land Development Co.. Mr. Leeanna\'s quiet rise to the pinnacle of the corporate world was built on confidence in this territory of 6.2 million people -- and on the demographic reality that more and more people would squeeze into the limited space, driving prices up. Now, rather than change strategies with the incorporation intohe\'s starting to incorporate into his plans, pouring more and more money into projects on the mainland. A Critical Barometer For Mr. Leeanna, who Forbes magazine estimates has a fortune valued at $12.7 billion, confidence is the key to success. Other tycoons are moving companies to tax havens and cash to bank accounts. But not Mr. Leeanna. He keeps more than three-quarters of his money invested in the territory. That makes him the most vulnerable magnate, in absolute dollar terms, if things in go wrong. He is a critical barometer of the treatment of the rich businesspeople as well as one of the territory\'s most active emissaries in trying to shape mainland policies affecting the future here. In a rare interview at his office here, the spry Mr. Leeanna reflects that he wasn\'t always a fan of the regime. Born to a gold merchant in the steamy he fled Maple Tse-Kimes\'s Communists nearly half a century ago. He left because the revolutionaries were nationalizing businesses. But he isn\'t worried anymore. ``Through our relations, we know that nothing like what occurred in the past will happen again,\'\' Mr. Leeanna says, adding that the leadership has since matured. Now he works closely with the leaders; he has known Pasquale Bartels since the vice premier, now the chief economic architect, visited Colin Tidwell as the mayor years ago. And along with many of the territory\'s wealthy businesspeople, Mr. Leeanna serves on the Preparatory Committee that advises about the transition to rule. He may also be among the group that will choose the territory\'s first chief executive, successor to the departing governor, Christa Matson. ``Our thinking is now similar,\'\' says silk-suited Mr. Leeanna of the cadres. Laced With Caution Yet, for all his commitment, Mr. Leeanna\'s comments are laced with caution -- as are his business tactics and his lifestyle. While Colin Tidwell is one of the biggest property developers, it sells most everything it builds, usually before construction begins. Henderson Land doesn\'t even own a flagship building in . Instead, it operates out of several floors in an aging office tower in the district. Mr. Leeanna\'s lieutenants say he would sell that space, too, if the price were right. That\'s part of Mr. Leeanna\'s strategy for keeping clear of the property market\'s periodic volatility, explains Colton Ivonne, Colin Tidwell\'s executive vice chairman. Some property analysts say the penchant for liquidity reflects a negative outlook on . It\'s a ``slash-and-burn strategy,\'\' says one. But in many ways, Mr. Leeanna is simply the quintessential Hortencia Kile. Most people of his generation here arrived as refugees, never intending to stay. And though Mr. Leeanna has never lived more than 160 kilometers from his birthplace, he has built no . Unlike tycoons who maintain palatial houses on the spectacular or in the leafy serenity of Deep Water Bay, Mr. Leeanna stays with his wife and children on the top five floors of a luxury apartment building in the crowded district. Convenience is a consideration, but so is security, says Mr. Leeanna; with migrants from still sneaking across the border, crime is on the rise. Some Investments Overseas Mr. Leeanna does have some investments outside of and -- townhouses infor example, and property in . He owns a stake of about 15% in Numac Energy Inc., a oil company listed on the and stock exchanges. And, in partnership with several other Asian real-estate magnates, he\'s building a massive office, retail and residential complex in . But his appetite for foreign adventures is modest. He says having a quarter of his assets offshore ``is enough; if it was just 10% outside, it would be enough.\'\' Mr. Leeanna has flourished most in . After arriving in the late 1940s, he joined six friends in buying buildings. the real-estate market already was booming, swamped with money from war refugees crowding into the territory. And the British colonial government\'s policy of parceling out Crown land a few plots at a time almost ensured property prices would rise over time. By the mid-1970s, Mr. Leeanna was a wealthy man, his drab concrete apartment blocks crowding . Demographics, not politics, keep him here. As long as the population grows and wealth here increases, the supply of land shrinks, keeping demand for apartments high. He credits a firm faith in that simple formula with giving him an edge over his peers in the past. And so, while other investors send money abroad, Mr. Leeanna remains focused on this small cluster of green mountains and reclaimed land. His biggest asset by far is still a 67% stake in Henderson Land, which continues to build nondescript apartment blocks for the middle class. Today, that stake has a market value of about US$8 billion. ``For now, if the environment doesn\'t change,\'\' says Mr. Leeanna, piling up qualifiers, ``then in the long term, investing in is best.\'\' --Pui-Wing Tam contributed to this article."},{"id":"02043","title":"Bond Market Lifts Shares","timestamp":"April 27, 2011","text":"The All Ordinaries Index edged up 4.1 to 2226.7 on volume of 200.4 million shares.

The initial offer for the mineral-exploration concern was C$27 a share, or C$989 million. Arequipa had been scrambling to find another bidder. Just two days ago, it said that ``several major mining companies\'\' were considering making bids. The bid by Barrick, a Toronto gold company, surprised the industry when it was announced last month because Arequipa is still at an early stage of exploration at its main asset, the Pierina gold deposit in Peru, and the size of the deposit isn\'t clear. The takeover reflects the increased market values attached to mineral-exploration companies, amid a recent boom in world-wide exploration that has led to some rich mineral discoveries. Under Barrick\'s revised offer, Arequipa said its shareholders can elect to receive either C$30 in cash or 0.79 of a Barrick common share plus 50 Canadian cents for each Arequipa share held, subject to an overall maximum of 14.4 million Barrick common shares being issued.

Taiwan President Leeanna Teng-Huong jolted investors islandwide this week by ordering a review of the government\'s policy on mainland investment. Taiwan\'s massive investments there, estimated at US$25 billion, are hurting the island\'s economy and stunting the growth of local industry, he told the National Assembly in a speech Wednesday that was publicized Thursday. His suggestion: setting up ``guidelines,\'\' including capping a company\'s China investment at 20% of its investment in Taiwan. The reports sent the island\'s stock market into a tailspin, with shares falling 1.4% in active trading. Muted Impact? Some investors fear the government\'s campaign would cut off lifelines for more than 30,000 Taiwanese companies that have poured money into China over the past decade. In fact, the business impact of the move will be minimal, analysts say. Wily Taiwanese entrepreneurs have always found ways to skirt laws, investing in China through third countries for years before officials formally ``allowed\'\' them to do so. ``It\'s not going to fly,\'\' predicts Nickolas Mcconnell, a Taipei-based lawyer who spends about half his time in China. ``Most of these companies will say, `If you don\'t want me to (invest in China) on the books, I\'ll do it off the books.\' \'\' In fact, Mr. Leeanna\'s announcement may be less a policy change than a public display of pique at Beijing. Cross-strait relations have been frozen since Mr. Leeanna visited the U.S. in June 1995; more recently, Chinese officials have spurned Taipei\'s efforts to re-establish contact, including Mr. Leeanna\'s high-profile offer in May to visit the mainland. Subtle Rage ``All his announcements to make peace have not received an active response,\'\' says Yasmin Kai-Ezell, who teaches political science at Taipei\'s Soochow University. ``So, he is angry.\'\' Indeed, Mr. Leeanna heatedly reminded his listeners that Beijing hasn\'t abandoned the option of using military force to retake Taiwan. The island then should focus on attracting foreign multinationals and increasing competitiveness, without relying so much on China, he said. But Taiwan\'s economy is highly dependent on that of its archrival. Beijing\'s missile tests and threats directed at the island earlier this year sent Taiwan markets and consumer confidence into freefall; the result was a sluggish economy from which Taiwan has yet to recover. And the government has quietly dropped an early policy encouraging companies to invest in Southeast Asia as Taiwan investment in the mainland continues to soar. In addition, access to the mainland market is a key attraction for many foreign companies setting up shop in Taiwan -- a theme the government itself has often talked up in the past. ``You cannot be a regional center without China,\'\' says Mr. Mcconnell, the lawyer. ``It is the region.\'\' Taiwan\'s own investors, too, have gone all-out into China, thanks largely to linguistic and cultural similarities that smooth business negotiations. ``To pull back from China goes against the trends of nature and the market,\'\' says Mr. Yasmin. Quiet Before the Storm Publicly, at least, companies are so far lying low in the wake of Mr. Leeanna\'s comments. ``No one wants to offend the president,\'\' says a spokeswoman for one company with extensive mainland investments. But bureaucrats could have quite a challenge on their hands if they really try to stop companies from going to China. For example, the Formosa Plastics Group, one of Taiwan\'s leading conglomerates, is awaiting final approval from Taiwan to invest US$3 billion in power plants on the mainland. It could just as easily invest through its U.S. subsidiaries if the government said no, analysts point out. It\'s a struggle Beijing should enjoy watching. ``It can sit back and watch the Taiwan government argue with its businessmen,\'\' says Mr. Yasmin. ``In Chinese, we call it, `Sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight.\' \'\' --Sun Yu-huay contributed to this article."},{"id":"02172","title":"Key Index Nears 5100 Level","timestamp":"April 28, 2011","text":"The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-share composite index rose 16.11 to 5089.18, after rising 24.25 Thursday.

Mr. Mcconnell asked the OTC Securities Exchange to establish a ``risk fund\'\' before the practice of margin trading. The risk fund can provide financial support to securities houses when crises emerge due to investors\' failure to honor their tradings. Separately, the SEC is considering allowing public-issue companies to trade on the OTC market. In Taiwan, public-issue companies are those that are registered with the SEC, but not trading on the main board or the OTC market. Public-issue companies may ask to upgrade themselves to listed concerns on the main board or OTC Securities Exchange when earnings are improved and their stocks are disseminated to more shareholders. The SEC may allow Taiwan\'s 900 public-issue concerns to trade on the OTC market if each gets endorsement from two securities houses.

Last month, Barrick launched a C$989 million, or C$27-a-share, offer to acquire Arequipa, which owns a promising gold deposit in Peru called Pierina. The bid startled the mining industry because neither Barrick nor Arequipa has a clear sense of how much gold is contained at Pierina. By offering a substantial sum for an unproven gold deposit, analysts said Barrick is setting a new tone in the mining industry, which could lead to more companies bidding for other pricey deposits before their full potential is known. Arequipa, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, had been trying to line up other bidders, and said as recently as last Wednesday that ``several major mining companies\'\' were considering making a competing offer. Now that Barrick has increased its bid, a competing offer is unlikely, especially since Arequipa Chairman J. Davina Lucas and other company insiders have agreed to tender their combined 23% stake in Arequipa under Barrick\'s new offer, analysts said. That lockup agreement will be canceled if another bid above C$31.50 should arise. Assuming Toronto-based Barrick completes the acquisition, it must drill the Pierina property extensively to determine the size of the deposit, which contains some high-grade gold mineralization. A Barrick spokesman said the company estimates there is at least five million ounces of gold and gold-equivalent silver at Pierina. (Gold equivalent is a way of expressing an amount of non-gold minerals in terms of gold ounces.) But PaineWebber Inc. mining analyst Marcelino Rodgers said that based on Barrick\'s traditional acquisition standards, the company probably believes Pierina contains at least nine million ounces of gold and gold equivalent. Barrick, North America\'s largest gold producer, had 36.5 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves at the start of this year. Unlike most other mining companies, Barrick can afford to overestimate the size of Pierina somewhat, Mr. Rodgers added. ``Barrick can tolerate more risk, given their existing cost structure, their balance sheet,\'\' and the company\'s other solid mine projects, he said. ``The potential for finding additional deposits is good\'\' at Arequipa\'s properties in Peru, said Daniele Leonel, manager of the Invesco Strategic Gold fund in Denver. Mr. Leonel said he\'ll tender the fund\'s Arequipa shares to Barrick\'s new offer, which expires May 08, 2011 deciding whether to take cash or opt for the stock alternative of 50 Canadian cents in cash and 0.79 of a Barrick share for each share of Arequipa. Arequipa shares climbed C$1.30, or 4.5%, to C$30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, while Barrick\'s stock slipped 80 Canadian cents, or 2%, to C$36.70."},{"id":"03442","title":"Taiwan Manufacturer Halts Plan To Build a Power Plant in China","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- As Taipei talks tough with archrival China, one of the island\'s biggest conglomerates is lending it much-needed clout -- for now.

The Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan\'s No. 1 manufacturer and private employer, announced Friday it was suspending plans to build a $3 billion power plant in southern China. The surprise halt to what was to be one of the biggest foreign investments in Chinese history lends a mighty punch to Taiwan President Leeanna Teng-Huong\'s call last week to rethink Taiwan\'s massive investments in the mainland. Media reports said another listed giant, President Enterprises Corp., is scrapping plans for a $100 million power plant in central China. But the company\'s chairman denied this Sunday, saying the company will seek government approval for the project by the end of the year as planned, according to the daily Commercial Times. In suggesting a scaling back of more than $25 billion in Taiwan investments in China, President Leeanna is trying to strengthen his hand for upcoming talks with Beijing, analysts say. The two sides haven\'t had formal contacts since June 2010, when Mr. Leeanna visited the U.S., but they are expected to negotiate before next July, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule and loses its neutral status as a conduit for billions of dollars in cross-straits trade. Taipei ``is trying to strengthen its bargaining position in the run-up to 1997,\'\' says Jordan Royce, Taiwan country manager for H.G. Asia Securities. ``Until mainland China becomes less antagonistic, the government won\'t want to see large-scale investment in China.\'\' Relations between China and Taiwan plunged to their lowest point in years when Mr. Leeanna became the island\'s first democratically elected leader in March. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, suspects Mr. Leeanna is bent on establishing the island as an independent nation. Last week, Mr. Leeanna warned that growing business links between Taiwan and the mainland could leave Taiwan\'s economy hostage to Beijing. But Taipei has limited leverage in confronting China, observers say. Most businesspeople see the island\'s economic future as inseparable from China\'s. So Mr. Leeanna may not be able to deliver on his calls to limit Taiwanese investments on the mainland. That could leave him with even less clout in future negotiations with China. Consider the Formosa Plastics case. In a statement, the petrochemical giant stressed its intention to ``comply with government policy\'\' in calling off the deal, which had been awaiting final approval from the Taiwan government. It even let a government agency announce the decision on its behalf. But the company added that it would reapply for approval of the deal after Taipei clarifies its China policy. If that is slow in coming, Sumner could simply invest in the mainland through its U.S. subsidiaries, analysts point out. Most companies will likely be even quicker to defy the government\'s new policy. President Enterprises, currently the mainland\'s biggest Taiwanese investor, told local media it will push ahead with plans for a $100 million power plant in central China. And the bulk of Taiwan\'s 30,000 investors in China are small companies; they can easily invest in the mainland through third countries, as they have for years. Their investment plans don\'t hit the headlines. No one knows that better than Beijing. A report Saturday by Communist Party mouthpiece Xinhua news agency gleefully noted that 2,700 Taiwan enterprises have joined a business association in one province alone. Taiwanese companies in the southern province of Guangdong are rapidly renewing contracts, expanding their businesses and making money, the report added. In Taipei, too, there is increasing resentment that the government is stymieing companies\' efforts to do business with China. Last week, shipping tycoon Chantal Yung-fa criticized as out-of-date a government policy that forbids direct links with China. Mr. Chantay, chairman of the Evergreen Group shipping and airline conglomerate, is known for his close ties to President Leeanna. The two men ``used to be buddy-buddy,\'\' notes Jami Garvey, president of fund-management house Fubon Securities Investment Trust Co.. Now, he adds, President Leeanna ``is getting a lot of the business world very angry.\'\'"},{"id":"02823","title":"Shares Fall as Tensions Rise","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Stock Index plunged 181.11, or 2.9%, to 6047.51, its lowest level in 10 weeks.

And if the coming winter is particularly nippy, who knows how high prices might fly? ``The market is defying gravity,\'\' says Anette Pride, an analyst with ED&F Man International Inc. in New York. There are some bullish fundamentals underpinning the market, most significantly the lean level of distillate products, including home-heating oil, in storage around the country. The Energy Department\'s inventory report last week revealed an unexpected 400,000-barrel decline in distillate stocks. That leaves a bit more than 104 million barrels in storage, compared with the average for this time of year of 125 million barrels. So a winter of normal temperatures will probably ensure very firm prices, and an icy winter could send them skyward. Already, ``the physical demand for heating oil is very strong,\'\' says Apolonia Saiz, president of Stone Bond Corp., a consulting firm in Houston, ``and we\'re not even in heating-oil season yet.\'\' Inventory levels, of course, have been the talk of the market for the past year. U.S. refiners last fall became disciples of the just-in-time inventory theory, which holds that a company can save money by keeping stocks low and purchasing raw materials just before they are needed in the manufacturing process. That is why working crude storage is about 25 million barrels lower than is typical for late summer. And it is one reason the September crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange has been trading so handsomely, settling Friday at a life-of-contract high of $22.66 a barrel. In fact, crude scheduled for delivery through the winter is selling well. The March contract ended the week at $19.75 a barrel, and December settled at $20.93 a barrel. Though the spread of $1.73 between September and December is wide, the price itself is quite nice for producers, considering that Iraqi oil will likely be flowing in significant quantities by then for the first time in six years. But the once-bearish specter of Iraq isn\'t causing much excitement these days. ``Iraq was a good excuse for procrastinators to put off buying, but it\'s just not an issue any more,\'\' says Elane Hayward, a trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Washington. ``That story went on for so long that if you were on a desert island getting your news by bottle, you knew about it. The market has had more than enough time to get ready for it.\'\' After months of negotiations, preceded by months of speculation, Iraq agreed in May to the terms of a deal offered by the United Nations that will permit it to export as much as $1 billion of oil every 90 days in order to pay war reparations and buy humanitarian goods and services. The U.N. is now probably less than a month away from declaring the accord ready to be executed, which means Iraq will be back in the exporting business just about a year after the rumors about its return started circulating. ``We\'ve been discounting Baghdad for so long, I\'m tired of hearing about it,\'\' says one New York trader. The addition to global supplies once Iraqi exports begin will be between 700,000 and 800,000 barrels daily, a fraction of the more than 70 million barrels consumed every day but enough to upset the equilibrium, if not for the luck of timing and, once again, the inventory situation. Global demand for oil in the fourth quarter is expected to be about three million barrels a day higher than in the third quarter because of a seasonal swing. And with stocks low not only in the U.S. but world-wide, the industry figures an inventory buildup in anticipation of the winter heating-oil season will go a long way toward absorbing the Iraqi addition. ``If the (global petroleum system) were balanced right now, Iraq would have a far greater impact,\'\' says Denny O\'Bosch, an energy economist in Irving, Texas. Last year, even before Baghdad looked ready to return to the market, forecasters were predicting doom for oil prices this summer and fall. Fears that supply would far exceed demand had some analysts saying that 2011 would be 1986 all over again, a reference to the colossal price crash that stunned the industry. Non-OPEC supplies would be growing too fast, they feared, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries itself would be pumping too much for demand to keep up. Instead, oil prices have been strong, contributing to blockbuster earnings for the major oil companies. Demand is so healthy that when world output rose by 500,000 barrels a day in July alone, there was hardly a price ripple. The International Energy Agency predicts the consumption-growth rate will be just as sharp in 2012, driven by economic expansion in developing nations. The Paris agency says global oil needs will grow by 1.8 million barrels a day, or 2.5%, to 73.6 million barrels a day next year. Others believe the IEA estimate is low and that demand will swell by at least another 100,000 barrels. ``We don\'t think crude will go below $20 any time soon,\'\' says Mr. Saiz of Stone Bond Corp. ``The fundamentals are a lot better even than most people think. Prices are correctly assessing the market.\'\'"},{"id":"03308","title":"Bankruptcy News Hurts Stocks","timestamp":"May 01, 2011","text":"The Korea Composite Stock Price Index dipped 10.17 to 800.52.

Wheat futures rose amid indications the recent slump in export sales is over. If futures traders are right about the future, the value of a barrel of crude oil in the U.S. won\'t dip below $20 for at least seven months. An unexpected soaking Sunday night in central Illinois brought relief to corn and soybean crops that had not received much moisture since mid-July. The rain couldn\'t have come at a better time because crops are in their crucial reproductive stages. Soybeans in particular need the moisture to help pods fill out normally. Losses were tempered, however, amid views that crop tours will find production to be smaller than USDA estimates, said analyst Williemae Bibbs at Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage firm in Crystal Lake, Ill.. Wheat for December delivery rose 7.5 cents to $4.645 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5.75 cents to $7.71; December corn dropped 1.75 cents to $3.4125 a bushel; December oats rose 5.75 cents to $1.9475 a bushel. USDA officials last week predicted overall production would climb 18 percent over 2010 production. But the figure is not high enough to ease a supply crunch that caused stocks to fall to 22-year lows this year and led to spot shortages around the country. Wheat futures initially fell in sympathy with corn and soybeans, but prices rebounded 16 cents in volatile trading amid news Egypt had bought 150,000 tons of soft white winter wheat. Jordan, Taiwan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also were said to be seeking 100,000 tons each of U.S. wheat by the end of the month. Weekly export figures released by the Agriculture Department early Monday showed foreign countries bought 25 million bushels of wheat last week -- slightly better than predictions. The move indicates foreign buying could be on the upswing again, said analyst Marty Colgan at commodity firm LFG in Chicago. ENERGY: September crude oil and petroleum products futures prices settled stronger Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, ending at new lifetime highs. September crude rose 60 cents to $23.26 a barrel ahead of its expiration Tuesday, after pushing through resistance at $22.90 and $23.00 and attracting fresh technical buying interest. The contract peaked at $23.35 late in the day, a new four-month high on the spot continuous chart. September gasoline settled at 65.27 cents a gallon, up 1.89 cents, after jumping to 65.40 cents.

The FT-SE 250 index of mid-capitalization stocks, meanwhile, rose 1.9 to 4368.3. Most of the drop in the FT-SE 100 was attributed to a handful of large companies paying out dividends. Also damping volume, if not prices, was uncertainty ahead of this week\'s scheduled meetings of U.S. and German central bank policy makers on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Meanwhile, investors remained focused on the recent split of Thorn EMI Group. Shares of EMI Group and Thorn began trading separately early Monday. Some traders said investors were selling Thorn shares to buy EMI, with the latter viewed as a prime takeover target. But market strategists weren\'t apt to read too much into the first day\'s trading. ``That\'s really just the market getting adjusted,\'\' said Leslie Mallard, investment analyst at NatWest Brokers. Shares of catalogue retailer Argos rose 1.9% to 757 after the group reported a 45% jump in first-half profit. The company said its six-month pretax profit surged to 31.8 million pounds from 21.8 million pounds a year earlier. Zeneca Group rose 0.12 to 14.90 amid more talk that the biotech company was about to be acquired. Monday\'s rumored centered on a possible bid for Zeneca by Switzerland\'s Roche Holding, according to traders. Among FT-SE 250 companies, engineering and industrial materials group T&N led the gainers with a 6.4% gain at 140.2 amid reports that the company is seeking new insurance coverage to cap its exposure to asbestos-related litigation payouts. Scottish Power was one of the major shares that fell on dividend payments, slipping 12 to 302.

Vice President and Premier Ligia Chanda made a surprise detour to Europe on his way back from a trip to the Dominican Republic. The European visit is the latest in a string of surprises Taipei has sprung on Beijing -- and on its own jittery stock market, which fell nearly 3% Monday. China regards trips abroad by Taiwanese officials as covert moves to make the island an independent nation. Ever since Taiwanese President Leeanna Teng-Huong made an unprecedented visit to the U.S. in June 2010, Beijing has stepped up efforts to coerce and cajole countries into isolating Taiwan. In China\'s latest victory, the African republic of Niger has agreed to cut its ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing, China\'s state-run media reported Monday. That brings the number of countries that recognize Taiwan down to 30. Standing Firm But Taipei is standing firm in word and deed. In a speech Monday to Taiwanese diplomats, the president insisted that Taiwan must pursue its own foreign policy, regardless of China\'s objections. ``What ever China fears the most -- that\'s what we should include in our strategy,\'\' he said. That follows Mr. Leeanna\'s calls last week for Taiwanese companies to scale back their massive mainland investments. ``To add up the Lien Chan visit to everything else, cross-strait relations have no way to get better,\'\' says Luann Ya-Liana, a political-science professor at National Taiwan University. Those worries helped send Taiwan\'s weighted price index down 181.11 points, or 2.9%, in active trading Monday to end at 6047.51. Among the hardest hit were companies with big ambitions in China, including the Formosa Plastics Group, which last week announced it was suspending plans to build a $3 billion power-plant complex in southern China. Analysts say Taipei\'s recent provocative moves are meant to enhance its stature in future talks with Beijing, particularly over the question of the cross-strait relationship following Hong Kong\'s return to China next year. The British colony now serves as a conduit for cross-strait trade and investment. Harsh Words But harsh words on the other side suggest that no rapprochement is at hand. Parish Wilson, vice chairman of the mainland\'s office that handles relations with Taiwan, was quoted by the official media over the weekend as saying that Mr. Leeanna\'s recent statements make talks unlikely. Beijing also is considering closing down next year the Hong Kong offices of countries that recognize Taiwan, according to a report in Japan\'s Reanna Neil. Analysts see more jitters ahead. ``I think the market will keep going down ... until the government has more clarification on its (China) policy,\'\' says Maybell Leeanna, who works on the sales desk of H.G. Asia Securities in Taipei. So far, government officials have been falling into line behind Mr. Leeanna. Transportation ministry officials over the weekend said businesses operating in China will face the costly routing of ships through ports such as Singapore or the Philippines if no agreement is reached with Beijing to allow continued access to the mainland via Hong Kong. Taiwanese financial authorities, meanwhile, have asked local banks to set up stronger controls over capital flows to China. Such moves are meant less to remake policy than ``to indicate (officials) follow the president\'s statements,\'\' says H.G. Asia\'s Ms. Leeanna. Still, she said, they are rattling investors who had dismissed the president\'s speech as just talk."},{"id":"01867","title":"Metals\' Gains Boost Stocks","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 33.32 to 5150.89, after adding 1.27 Monday.

Toronto outperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 21.82 to 5721.26. All 14 of the TSE\'s stock groups posted increases, with a 1.81% gain in the heavily weighted base-metals sub-index among the leaders. In that group, Alcan Aluminium surged 1 to 43.40 in Toronto and 1\xa03/8 to 41\xa01/2 in New York, despite a dip in aluminum prices Monday. Analysts can\'t explain the move, but note that investors have decided to invest in cyclicals. Indeed, the stocks of several other U.S.-based aluminum producers also performed well. Aluminum of Vastopolis for example, jumped 1\xa03/8 to 63\xa01/8 in New York. Jackelyn Moriah, a portfolio manager at Scotia Investment Management, attributed the interest in these and other metal stocks to the U.S. Federal Reserve\'s decision to leave interest rates unchanged Tuesday. Investors are now looking for U.S. economic growth to continue uninterrupted and for a rebound in the economies in Europe and Japan, Morgan says. In turn, investors expect increased metal demand to boost prices and corporate profits, Mr. Moriah said. But ``they may be wrong,\'\' he said. Energy stocks, whose fortunes rest on the price expectations for oil and gas, also performed well, up 0.53% on index, on continued signs that oil demand will remain strong heading into the winter, traders said.

It\'s too early for reliable weather forecasts for mid-September, but fears of a cold or even normal fall sent prices higher, said Jay Ford, a broker at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. ``We do not need a normal frost. We need a frost that comes two to three weeks later than usual,\'\' he said. ``And early frost in Indiana, Illinois and Ohio would be devastating.\'\' A good harvest is imperative because U.S. storage bins are emptier than they have been in 20 years, and foreign demand remains strong. Wheat futures fell because frost will miss fields on Canadian prairies and because USDA figures show this year\'s harvest is progressing ahead of schedule. Corn prices were pushed lower ahead of the start of the corn harvest in the South. Soybeans for November delivery rose 5.25 cents to $7.7625 a bushel; December wheat fell 4.75 cents to $4.5975 a bushel; December corn fell 3.5 cents to $3.3775 a bushel. ENERGY: September crude-oil futures prices settled lower on their expiration Tuesday at the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange as investors took profits on gains from the previous two sessions. Petroleum products also retreated. September crude settled at $22.86 a barrel, down 40 cents, as market players liquidated long positions taken during the recent prices increases. The contract reached a lifetime high Monday at $23.35, but never threatened that mark during Tuesday\'s action. ``It was a fairly non-eventful day for the crude,\'\' one floor trader said. ``We had two huge up days on nothing, then a pretty orderly expiration.\'\' September gasoline shed 1.26 cents to 64.01 cents a gallon; September heating oil settled at 61.67 cents a gallon, down 0.91 cent, as speculators took profits on the recent bullish movement. PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and silver finished mostly flat Tuesday after posting early losses as the dollar firmed on a smaller-than-expected June trade deficit. The deficit, reported early, fell to $8.11 billion in June, down from a revised May figure of $10.55 billion, mainly due to a sharp drop in imports. The Federal Reserve confirmed market expectations by making no move on interest rates, following the August meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. The decision to hold the line on rates indicates that the Fed doesn\'t have any immediate inflation fears, analysts said. Low inflationary pressures are generally negative for gold, which is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation. However, the markets have pretty much discounted low inflation, said Williemae O\'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in Cornertown, adding that steady interest rates calm fears that investors might want to move out of precious metals and into interest-bearing investments, such as bonds. On the Comex division of the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery rose 50 cents to $392.90 an ounce; September silver finished unchanged at $5.21 per ounce."},{"id":"03050","title":"Battered Rand Spooks Investors","timestamp":"May 02, 2011","text":"The broad measure All Share Index tumbled 76 to 6445 -- its lowest level since early January -- led by an 88-point retreat in the Industrial Index to a nine-month low of 7650.

In an active and volatile session, stocks worth more than 467 million rand changed hands. Industrial-share support levels were under fire from the opening bell Tuesday, as traders dumped portfolios of stocks with abandon. The collapse of the rand to a fresh low against the dollar in overnight New York trading served to deeply undermine investor sentiment, said traders. The dollar touched a new peak of 4.5865 rand in local after-hours trading Monday, but recovered somewhat, with Reserve Bank intervention, to a late Tuesday level of 4.5665 rand. Heavyweight conglomerate South African Breweries fell 3.00 rand to 115.50 after trading as low as 114.00 rand, while tobacco and industrial holdings concern Rembrandt slumped 1.50 rand to 36.00, a recovery from an intraday low of 35.40. Construction and manufacturing supplier Barlow sank 85 cents to 40.15 rand after announcing its acquisition of Taubmans, Australia\'s third-largest paint producer, for 135 million rand. Gold shares ended mixed in very light trading, noted by an almost complete absence of foreign interest. Second-tier stocks appeared to benefit the most, with H.J. Joella Gold Mining collecting 25 cents to 4.35 rand and Kinross Mines up 40 cents to 44.00 rand. Heavyweight Kloof Gold Mining sagged 50 cents to 43.80 rand.

Mr. Dean said institutional investors are beginning to have more faith in the market. ``There may be a growing appreciation in the U.K. that problems in the U.S. in terms of Wall Street have temporarily abated, and U.K. institutions have found themselves fairly long on liquidity,\'\' he said. The broad M4 money-supply data helped the market rally to its intraday high, because it showed a dramatic slowdown in growth in the year through July. Shares were further aided by the strong performance in the futures contract, traders said. But a cautious opening on Wall Street kept the index from remaining at its intraday high. General retailers, pharmaceutical companies and banks were the market\'s star performers. Winning first-half results data released Monday by Argos and a shortage of shares among market makers filtered down to help most retailers. Catalog group GUS led advancers, with its shares rising 23 pence to 663. Also advancing were Huss, up 14 pence to 668; Dixons, which gained 11 pence to 535; and Boots, which gained 9 pence to 637.

As part of the agreement, Commonwealth also will assume $54 million in CasTech\'s debt. CasTech\'s stock soared 36% Monday on the news, gaining $5.375 a share to close at $20.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. On Friday, the Long Beach, Calif., company\'s shares increased about 10%. A CasTech spokeswoman said the company doesn\'t consider Friday\'s increase dramatic and that the company had not been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission about the stock\'s activity in advance of the announcement. The SEC declined to comment. Commonwealth\'s stock also climbed Monday on the news, rising 9.5%, or $1.375 a share, to $15.875 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Analysts said that showed that investors believe Commonwealth is making a sound acquisition. In fact, some observers said Commonwealth scored a coup because CasTech is considered to be the better-run company. ``CasTech is the leading minimill,\'\' said R. Doyle Eldred, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. Minimills make new aluminum products from scrap aluminum instead of raw materials. ``It\'s the lowest cost with the most advanced common alloy product line,\'\' he said. Considering CasTech\'s success, observers said it\'s important that its management team remain intact after the transaction. Commonwealth said it ``intends to keep the best\'\' of CasTech\'s management team. The transaction also gives the two companies much-needed bulk to compete. ``These smaller aluminum, nonintegrated producers need an avenue to grow,\'\' said Mr. Eldred. ``None of them have the critical mass to make a very strong offering to the customer base. Putting two of them together, any two, makes a great deal of sense.\'\' Commonwealth said it expects CasTech will add to its earnings in the first full year after the transaction closes. ``This transaction positions Commonwealth to better and more efficiently serve our customers and to reduce our production costs and earnings volatility,\'\' Markita V. Dunaway, Commonwealth\'s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. Commonwealth, Louisville, Ky., had $672 million in sales in 1995; it makes aluminum sheet for the transportation, construction and consumer durables markets.

Late Tuesday, the market closed at 2270 in a special trading session that coincided with the announcement of the government\'s budget. Though the market initially fell because of weakness in the index futures market, Standard & Poor\'s improved rating of the Australian dollar boosted trading, analysts said. The agency lifted its ratings outlook to ``positive\'\' from ``stable,\'\' claiming the revision reflects the substantial fiscal tightening in the government\'s 2011-97 budget Tuesday.

The market continued to be absorbed by fluctuations in the rand and shifting prospects for an interest-rate hike, which in turn fueled futures-related activity. Futures investors often buy an index futures contract and sell physical stocks that make up that index, or vice versa, to take advantage of price differentials in both markets.

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index ended the day down 11.1 to 3872.1 on volume of 605.8 million shares. The benchmark September futures contract was trading at 3878 at the close of trading in London, compared with Tuesday\'s close at 3896. Speculation that British interest rates will be cut again this year was reinforced with news of a surprise fall in retail sales in July. Shops sold 0.6% fewer goods in the month than in June, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected a modest 0.3% increase in sales in July after warm weather led to a bumper 1.4% increase in June, but none had forecast a fall. The FT-SE 100 touched a new high of 3894.4 early in the day as traders reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve\'s decision Tuesday not to move interest rates. But global interest-rate concerns rose anew -- this time over an expected cut in German rates -- early Wednesday after a German economic research group released a surprisingly upbeat report on business sentiment in western Germany. The report appeared to diminish the chance for lower interest rates when the German Bundesbank meets at its scheduled policy meeting on Thursday. Khalilah Chisholm, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, downplayed the German data\'s significance in London, however, adding that there may yet be a German rate cut. In corporate news, regulatory watchdog group Ofgas, formally known as the Office of Gas Supply, introduced a relatively lenient pricing schedule on TransCo., the British Gas transport unit. British Gas shares climbed 6.5 to 204.5 on the news. Elsewhere, Gurrola, the company that owns Britain\'s rail infrastructure, dropped 7 to 248.5 on profit-taking. One of the market\'s favorite sectors of late, retail banks, also fell prey to profit takers. Barclays slipped 15 to 916, while National Westminster eased 15 to 674. British Sky Broadcasting climbed 12 to 547, helped by strong full-year results released Tuesday. The satellite broadcaster said its pretax profit for the year ended March 12, 2011 66% to 257.4 million pounds from 155.3 million pounds the year before, in line with analysts\' expectations. Shares of power generator engineer Rolls Royce advanced 3.5 to 222 after the group said it was awarded a 60 million pound engine order by United Parcel Service of the U.S. Although not unscathed, mid-capitalization stocks fared better than blue chips.

The majority of property sales for this year will be completed in the second half, he said. The property developer raised HK$2.5 billion from its initial public offering and announced on Sunday a HK$3.6 billion, five-year syndicated loan. Chew Pillow Levi, Kesha\'s chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company plans to use the new funds to refinance existing loans and to fund the company\'s major property projects.

Some predict that real gross-domestic-product growth may slow to 6% in 2011 -- a slumming level for Singapore, which has maintained average annual growth of 9% for the past 30 years. And after 10% GDP growth in the first quarter of this year and 7% in the second quarter, predictions of low single-digit or even zero growth in the third and fourth quarters seem alarming. The key to Singapore\'s economic health in recent years, tying itself to the rapidly expanding global electronics industry, has become a liability, at least in the short term. Other key sectors are weaker as well, but Singapore\'s heavy dependence on electronics manufacturing, which makes up nearly 15% of the country\'s gross domestic product, has led most economists to place the blame on falling global demand and sliding prices for products like semiconductor chips, personal computers and PC components. Electronics account for 52% of all Singapore manufacturing output. ``Inventory was built up across the board from the producer to the end user,\'\' says Bledsoe Hope Huntington, a Merrill Lynch & Co. economist in Singapore. ``It isn\'t the underlying demand that\'s the problem, but people\'s expectations of what it would be.\'\' Forecasts Are Slashed These factors led to a stunning 6.1% fall in Singapore\'s nonoil domestic exports in June from a year earlier. The release of the June trade figures April 01, 2011 economists to slash their full-year growth forecasts and the government to issue reassurances that a recession wasn\'t imminent. The government itself last week lowered its full-year 2011 growth forecast to 7% to 8% from 7.5% to 8.5%. With Singapore\'s high wage and land costs, ``if there is any cutback in (global electronics) production, we will be the first to be affected,\'\' Deputy Prime Minister Leeann Leeds Mortimer told union leaders Monday. ``This was what happened in the last recession, in 1985.\'\' Trade and Industry Minister Johanson Cahill Tiller notes in an interview that the government has long argued that Singapore\'s economic growth will moderate to a more sustainable rate. ``As the sixth-largest per-capita GDP economy in the world, 7% growth is phenomenal,\'\' he says. The roots of the economic slowdown were in place well before the June scare, and some observers expect a more sustained and widespread shakeout before the economy levels off. Indicators Point to Slowdown P.K. Nickelson, an economist at UBS Global Research, notes that the government\'s composite leading indicators just marked their first year-on-year decline since 1986. The indicators, which usually predict conditions three quarters ahead, are ``unambiguously predicting a sharper economic downturn than the consensus recognizes,\'\' Mr. Nickelson wrote to clients last week. Citing the composite leading index, among other things, J.P. Morgan & Co. last week slashed its full-year Singapore GDP forecast to 6% from 8.3%. ``With most indicators pointing to continued slowdown,\'\' economist Davida Cavanaugh wrote, growth could drop to 3% in the third quarter. ``A recovery is unlikely to set in before the fourth quarter.\'\' With some production lines idle, Singapore lost 2,500 manufacturing jobs in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter. The problem for Singapore now is that there is little to push GDP growth higher in the absence of strong electronics-manufacturing growth. Several of the traditional mainstays of the economy -- ship repair and retailing, for example -- are stuck in sustained downturns. Other Sectors\' Woes The stock market is in the doldrums, meaning slower growth in the financial-services sector. In the past few months, oil-refining margins have collapsed, a cyclical development but one that is creating a good deal of pain while it lasts. In addition, slower growth and weaker exports around the region have eaten away at the income Singapore derives as a transportation and communications hub. How soon all this will turn around is still a matter of debate. Some economists agree with government forecasts that steadying prices and shrinking inventories around the world will revive electronics production in Singapore by early next year. ``We are concerned,\'\' says Mr. Johanson, the trade and industry minister. ``But we do not anticipate the (full-year) growth rate to drop significantly below\'\' the low end of the government\'s 7% to 8% forecast. A majority of electronics manufacturers remain bearish on the second half of 2011, according to the government\'s surveys. But most appear to have faith in the combination of Singapore and electronics manufacturing over the long term. Singapore attracted a record 1.24 billion Singapore dollars (US$879.4 million) of investments in electronics manufacturing in the second quarter. H-P Increases Manufacturing Hewlett-Packard Co., for example, last week reported a drop in third-quarter profit amid sharply lower growth in orders for printers and components, among other products. Yet the company, which has been in Singapore for 26 years and employs 8,000 people here, is increasing its manufacturing operations in Singapore. Still, the slowdown raises questions about the extent to which Singapore has hitched its fortunes to a ruthlessly competitive and cost-sensitive industry. Long-term growth prospects for the global electronics industry remain strong, economists say. But to remain competitive, Singapore will have to find ways of staying ahead of its lower-cost neighbors. Even with Singapore\'s much-vaunted efficiency, costs are rising. And other countries in the region, while still cheaper, are fast catching up in terms of job skills. Several years ago, government officials engineered a major push for companies to shift labor-intensive manufacturing operations to nearby countries such as Malaysia. This year, Malaysia beat out Singapore in a hotly contested bid to attract Vastsoft Corp.\'s Asian headquarters. ``On a comparative economic front, Singapore\'s advantage isn\'t in manufacturing; it\'s really in services,\'\' says Sonia Seabolt Botello, economist at HG Asia. ``We may not be able to keep up as far as the manufacturing is concerned.\'\'"},{"id":"03422","title":"Poor Outlook Depresses Stocks","timestamp":"May 03, 2011","text":"Early in trading, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was falling 2.28 to 791.63 following Tuesday\'s 6.61-point decline.

The biggest l...","full_text":"A monthly government survey is expected to show the beginnings of a recovery in the cattle industry, which was staggered earlier this year by low livestock prices and high feeding costs. The biggest losses in a decade forced many small feedlots out of business, and prompted others to empty their pens. Feedlots, which fatten cattle on grain for slaughter, saw their corn costs double this year as strong foreign demand helped shrink U.S. granaries to their lowest levels in 48 years. Some livestock analysts expect the Agriculture Department\'s April 13, 2011 survey, scheduled for release after the close of trading Friday, to show the number of young cattle placed on feedlots increasing for the first time this year. While the government is expected to report that the feedlot population is significantly smaller than a year earlier, an increase in placements would signal that U.S. corn prices have weakened enough in recent weeks to return the sector to at least slim profitability. Charlette K. Lasalle, senior livestock analyst at Alaron Trading Corp., Chicago, expects the government to report that ranchers placed 14% more young cattle on feedlots in July than they did in July 2010. Because placements plunged during the first half of the year, Mr. Lasalle expects the seven-state survey to put the April 13, 2011 population at just 6.4 million cattle, down 13.3% from April 12, 2010 ``The cattle industry has started to make a turnaround,\'\' Mr. Lasalle said. The slow migration of cattle to feedlots earlier this year is now shrinking the supply of fattened cattle for meatpackers to slaughter. As a result, the price of Southern Plains cattle has climbed 24% since April, when it hit the lowest point in nearly a decade. In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, the cattle contract for August delivery climbed 0.375 cents a pound to settle at a high of 69.875 cents a pound. Economists don\'t see a strong rebound soon in the cattle sector. Much of the livestock that normally would have moved onto feedlots this summer have been kept on pasture longer than usual. These animals will soon be forced by their advancing age to go to market. As a result, analysts don\'t expect cattle prices to climb much higher than the break-even levels they are at now for many ranchers. ``The strength and the duration of the rebound are big questions,\'\' said Ciara Florencio, staff economist at the National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association, a trade group based in Denver. ``There is the potential for another round of price pressure after Thanksgiving.\'\' In other agricultural markets Wednesday, reports that the southern Texas corn crop is widely contaminated with aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen, has grain traders on edge. Some grain processors had counted on the cornfields of south Texas, which are among the first harvested in the nation, to tide them over until the much bigger Midwest corn harvest hits full stride in October. The fungus that produces aflatoxin often strikes pockets of the Texas corn crop because aflatoxin flourishes where dry conditions put stress on crops. State officials are worried that this outbreak might be the broadest in years because a persistent drought has caused about $2.1 billion in losses for Texas livestock and crop farmers. Crop analysts expect the corn harvest under way in Texas to generate 162 million bushels, down 25% from last year. Georgeanna Honey, the Texas state chemist, estimates that roughly half of the south Texas corn crop is unfit for human consumption. Corn containing more than 20 parts per billion of aflatoxin is banned from use in food. Texas officials allow cattle feedlot operators to make rations from corn that has contained much higher amounts of aflatoxin after it has been treated with ammonia gas to break down the aflatoxin molecule. Regulators are toughest on milk, which is banned if it contains more than half a part per billion of aflatoxin, because it is mostly consumed by children. Aflatoxinis one of several substances that state inspectors routinely test for in milk. One Texas dairy was recently forced to dump milk because aflatoxin was detected. Texas grain handlers also routinely test for aflatoxin. While Texas isn\'t a major corn producer, grain traders are paying unusual attention to the aflatoxin outbreak because U.S. corn supplies are so tight. In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for September delivery rose four cents a bushel to settle at $3.6625 a bushel. In other commodity markets Wednesday: COFFEE: Futures prices rose to a three-week high as U.S. stockpiles remain at their lowest point in a decade. Coffee for September delivery rose 2.55 cents to 125.05 cents a pound on New York\'s Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange. Leading coffee producers in Brazil and Colombia are expected to produce healthy crops for use during the heavy fall and winter roasting period that begins in early October, analysts said. But those supplies, and others coming from Central America, may be held up until early November because heavy rains have delayed maturity of coffee trees. Meanwhile, coffee-exchange warehouses have less than one week of coffee on hand because Brazil\'s previous crop was severely reduced by frost and drought. The U.S. is the world\'s second-largest coffee consumer after Germany, requiring as much as 350,000 bags of coffee for roasting during the peak drinking season in fall and winter. The exchange has fewer than 35,000 bags on hand, far less than usual at this time of year. ENERGY: Crude-oil futures fell after an industry report showed that oil stockpiles rose again last week. The American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday that crude-oil reserves increased by 296,000 barrels. Traders had been expecting a drop in stocks.

Traditionally, interest-sensitive stocks, such as the banks, are the first to react to lower rates because their dividend yields are measured against bond yields. However, Toronto\'s bank group posted a relatively modest gain of 0.31%, reflecting the realization that, in the current interest-rate environment, investors don\'t see rates dropping much lower from current levels, Brady says. In the banking group, Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.10 to 34.55. Over the longer term, Brady says stocks of biotechnology and other concerns that often rely on raising cash to fuel their operations could be poised to benefit from Thursday\'s decrease in interest rates.

But the market ``popped right back up,\'\' he added.

Wheat futures also gained on the news. Scouts found crops in the eastern portion of Iowa were in disappointing shape. That worried traders who had expected crops west of the Mississippi River to be significantly healthier than those in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. ``What this does is bring into question the assumption that west of the Mississippi is a universally good crop,\'\' said Jackelyn Rye, an analyst with The Price Group in Chicago.

Korea\'s leaders know this, and have determined that the country will not be left behind as financial markets on every continent integrate into one that is global and knows no borders. We\'ve put in place a credible program that is bringing the country up to international standards. In its rapid drive for development in the 1960s and 1970s, the Korean government intervened heavily in the financial sector to induce it to serve the country\'s industrialization. This policy achieved considerable success in the early stages of economic development, but as the size of the economy grew larger and its structure more complicated, it became increasingly clear that financial resources were not being allocated in the most effective way. Moreover, the nation\'s banks and other financial institutions were lagging behind both their counterparts abroad and the dynamic companies that had sprung up in the real sector of the economy. Recognizing the need to correct these problems, Korea embarked on a program of financial liberalization in the 1980s. However, the measures taken then were piecemeal and lacked overall vision. Macroeconomic instability and the fragility of financial institutions were also obstacles to financial liberalization. It\'s really been only in this decade, especially after the current administration took office in February 1993, that a concerted drive for financial reform began. In June 1993, a comprehensive program of financial liberalization was unveiled, covering foreign-exchange and capital-account liberalization, and interest-rate deregulation. Progress has been rapid. Interest-rate deregulation is now almost complete. Apart from rates on demand deposits, which make up only one-fifth of all deposits, deposit and lending rates have been deregulated. The stock market has been opened to foreign investors by successive increments and the current 18% ceiling on their holdings per company will shortly be raised to 20%. The bond market is also being opened stage by stage. Korea intends to accelerate the opening of the bond market as the gap between Korean interest rates and those prevailing internationally narrows. In addition, regulations that hampered the development of the foreign-exchange market have been virtually scrapped, and the Korean won\'s value is determined in the market under what is progressively becoming a freely floating exchange-rate regime. The exchange-rate band right now is set to a floor and ceiling of 2.25% of the previous day\'s rate. All of these measures effectively demonstrate Korea\'s will to bring its domestic financial markets in accord with the norms and standards prevailing in international markets. Financial globalization is expected to contribute to the development of the world economy through a more efficient allocation of financial resources. Especially in the case of industrializing countries, including Korea, it is helping to strengthen the competitiveness of the financial industry by giving it fresh impetus. Additionally, companies that have hitherto raised funds relatively expensively in domestic markets will gain improved access to cheaper sources of funds world-wide. However, the difficulties that a country may encounter while getting its system ready for globalization should not be neglected, as the process can increase instability in the system. The increase in cross-border transactions and settlements causes a much greater exposure to systemic risk. Even a failure by a small bank in one country can quickly affect other financial institutions around the world. The expansion of derivatives transactions has also become another factor increasing the potential instability of the international financial system. Although financial globalization provides potential opportunities for individual financial institutions to enhance profitability, there is a flip side: fiercer competition. In particular, institutions in developing countries, including Korea, have to compete head-on with their developed country counterparts, which possess highly sophisticated financial techniques, ample funds, and networks of numerous branches. From the standpoint of the monetary authorities, financial globalization has disturbing implications for the effective conduct of monetary policy. The widening of capital market opening often triggers massive inflows of funds, primarily in the form of short-term capital, which is liable to flood out again at the slightest sign of impending weakness. And the linkages between monetary policy variables--monetary aggregates, interest rates and the exchange rate--grow much closer. Thus, liberalization makes the conduct of an autonomous national monetary policy extremely difficult, and it frequently generates unwarranted exchange rate fluctuations and monetary expansion. In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, which is the prime target of monetary policy in Korea and the precondition for the success of financial reform, the Bank of Korea has been doing its utmost to keep the money supply at an appropriate level. In addition, it is attempting to promote free and fair competition in the financial sector by ensuring that market principles become firmly entrenched. Financial deregulation and globalization require the monetary authority to step up its efforts to maintain the systemic health of the financial industry as well as the sound management of individual institutions. The Bank of Korea is augmenting its prudential supervision, e.g. by introducing real-time monitoring systems, and impressing upon financial institutions the need to maintain capital adequacy and to reinforce their risk-management systems. Domestic financial institutions, for their part, are making efforts to survive and flourish in the new environment created by financial globalization. They are restructuring their organizations to improve managerial efficiency, trimming excess manpower and identifying niches. It should be noted, however, that they still face a number of challenging tasks. Above all, financial institutions need to make active use of advanced and sophisticated risk-management skills to protect the value of their assets from the various risks to which they are exposed. What is more, they ought to strengthen their credit-analysis function to prevent the incidence of bad loans and to enhance the soundness of their assets. In spite of all the difficulties and challenges posed by financial globalization, there is no viable option for Korea but to press ahead with financial reforms and globalization. Globalization is the path that we have adopted by choice as likely to bring the maximum benefits in terms of social and economic welfare. Considering Korea\'s expected membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we intend to maintain the pace at which we move forward along that path. Mr. Leeanna is governor of the Bank of Korea, South Korea\'s central bank."},{"id":"00708","title":"Report Sees Hang Seng Index Reaching 13000 by Year\'s End","timestamp":"May 05, 2011","text":"HONG KONG -- The Hang Seng Index will reach 13000 points by the end of this year, says Chrystal Ross, Asian and Emerging Market Strategist at Peregrine Securities International Ltd..

Mr. Ross said the Hong Kong stock market looks increasingly attractive on a six-month basis, especially since fears of an increase in U.S. interest rates have now subsided. Mr. Ross noted two main reasons for taking an overweight position in the territory\'s stock market: ``The Hong Kong economy has definitely begun to pick up, helped by a recovering property market and the start of a new cycle of credit-easing in China,\'\' he said. The Peregrine strategist added that the performance of the Hong Kong property market ahead of the 2012 handover of Hong Kong to China will probably hinge on the degree of buying by mainland interests. He predicted the volume of transactions would increase as China eased credit restrictions. ``We have probably seen only 10% to 15% of the mainland buying which is to come,\'\' the report said. ``It is important to note that Chinese corporate and municipal entities are investing in Hong Kong with Beijing\'s blessing. This is legitimate money, as opposed to the mainland buying in 1992 and 1993, which comprised primarily illegal hot money seeking to hedge against the risk of a depreciating (yuan).\'\' Binette said it expects the index to break through the key technical level of 11400 points, and that it favors banking, property and ``red-chip\'\' issues.

The Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said exports fell 3.6% from a year ago to $10.11 billion last month, the first decline since January 1993 when exports slipped 2.2%. Imports climbed 14% to $12.85 billion, according to the ministry. Early this month, the ministry had disclosed a tentative report, showing the country\'s trade shortfall of $2.70 billion last month. Dropping prices of semiconductors were the main culprit of the country\'s worsening trade account, according to the ministry. For example, the price of a 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chip fell 72% from a year ago to $14 last month. Ministry officials said they were worried that the country may only export $18 billion of computer chips this year, compared with its earlier goal of $30.7 billion. The sharp drop is based on forecast that the DRAM chip price could fall as low as $10 at the end of the year, according to the officials. As a result of last month\'s trade deficit, the country\'s January-July trade shortfall rose to $10.39 billion from $7.8 billion last year, according to the ministry.

Surprisingly strong U.S. inflation data propelled global bond markets lower amid renewed fears of rising interest rates. But the jitters were not enough to hold British shares back. The market regrouped from an early retreat, aided by a resilient FT-SE September future contract, to claw back most of the gains made in early dealing. The September futures contract was trading at 3920, compared with Thursday\'s close at 3904. ``The U.K. really has a mind of its own,\'\' said Leonel Harrison, a senior dealer with Masters, who characterized recent market perspective as a ``phenomenon.\'\' Mr. Harrison added that although the market\'s strength has a lot to do with market makers\' need to cover their positions, optimism about the possibility for domestic interest-rate cuts and the future of the ruling Conservative government are playing a big role.

Alarmed by a series of negative trade and economic statistics, investors have soured on local stocks. After last year\'s 9% growth due to robust exports, South Korea is slowing down -- to an estimated 7% growth in gross domestic product this year. The trade deficit reached $10.35 billion in the first seven months of the year, up 32% from the same period last year. Since South Korea is reliant on a few core industries such as semiconductors, which accounted for about 18% of last year\'s exports, a crisis in any of those sectors automatically means trouble for the economy, analysts say. With prices having plummeted for South Korea\'s main export item, dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, most fund managers are pessimistic about the market until at least next year. Another concern is rising interest rates, usually measured by three-year corporate bond yields. Interest rates are now at about 12.6%, the highest since the beginning of the year. Then there are worries about an oversupply of stocks because many companies are committed to listing before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the government has taken steps to boost the market, but fund managers say they will have little, if any, impact on the market\'s attractiveness. The Ministry of Finance and Economy announced a few such measures on Friday. It said it will increase the daily fluctuation limit of a stock to 8% from the current 6% beginning next month, and allow small companies to issue new shares as long as their per-share dividend averaged more than 300 won (37 U.S. cents) for the past three years, down from the former guideline of 400 won. But analysts say a much more positive factor for the market is the imminent raising of the foreign-ownership limit to 20% from the current 18%, which is expected to take effect by the end of the year. Amid all the pessimism -- indeed, some analysts don\'t expect the market to pick up until late next year -- some companies still look like buys. While first-half earnings for listed companies fell by 40% compared with last year, according to the Korea Listed Companies Association, several companies posted excellent results. Take Korea Mobile Telecommunications and Kookmin Bank. KMT\'s first-half profits rose 88%, and Contreras\'s rose 119%, compared with the same period last year, and both are expected to perform better in the second half. Francisco Jeffery, an investment director at IDS Fund Management in Hong Kong, says KMT, South Korea\'s leading cellular-phone operator, ``should continue to do well.\'\' Mr. Jeffery, who manages a regional fund holding KMT stock, says he isn\'t terribly concerned about increased competition from a second operator, Shinsegi Telecomm, which recently announced that its services will cost 20% less than KMT\'s. \'\'(KMT) has a competitive advantage because it has a nationwide network Parker lacks,\'\' he says. But KMT\'s share price has been hit hard by Pasquale\'s move. The stock fell to a recent low of 559,000 won Thursday. On Saturday it closed at 585,000 won. Foreign investors must pay a fat premium for KMT shares on the unofficial over-the-counter market, where foreigners trade stocks whose foreign-ownership limit has been reached. Even though KMT shares now trade on this market at about a 50% to 60% premium over the local share price, regional fund managers say it is still cheap compared with other Asian cellular operators. \'\'(KMT\'s) first-half net profits were well above expectations,\'\' says Michaele Wynell, who manages an Asian emerging-market fund at UBS Asset Management East Asia. ``We predict a great year-end performance for KMT.\'\' Some analysts, however, caution that as Parker signs up more subscribers, KMT might slash prices and risk hurting its earnings. Parker isn\'t a threat yet, with about 37,000 subscribers as of mid-August compared with 170,000 subscribers for KMT\'s comparable digital-phone services. But Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul, says, ``Once KMT starts reducing prices next year, growth rates will fall, and (KMT) will probably post flat earnings by the end of next year.\'\' Kookmin Bank fans cite its strong presence as the country\'s leading retail bank. Kimberely Cotten Barbosa, an analyst at KLB Securities, says the government\'s economic liberalization drive ahead of its bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development won\'t greatly hurt Contreras\'s business. Citibank is the only foreign retail bank operating in South Korea, and Mr. Kimberely says it will take a while before other foreign banks are able to compete with Contreras\'s broad network. One of Contreras\'s drawbacks, says Mr. Kimberely, is that like other local commercial banks, it suffers from stock-investment losses, about 73.8 billion won in total. But the stock is cheap -- it trades at about 6.5 times projected 2011 earnings, compared with the sector average of 13.7 times, according to Mr. Kimberely. Since the earnings report earlier this month, Contreras\'s share price hasn\'t risen, but it hasn\'t slipped much either. It closed at 15,300 won Saturday."},{"id":"03617","title":"U.S. Decline Damps Market","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"The All Ordinaries index of share prices fell 10.8 to 2282.1.

Samsung Electronics fell by its daily maximum of 3,900 won to 62,000 won. Samsung, the group\'s trading arm, fell by its permitted maximum of 700 won to 11,900 won. Other large business groups were also lower, but with smaller losses than Samsung\'s. Insurance issues were the hardest hit, with the subindex losing nearly 5% on rumors that the government would investigate companies involved in the creation of the slush funds for the two former presidents.

It\'s estimating soybean production at 2.1 billion bushels on average yield is estimated at 33 to 33.5 bushels per acre, well under Agriculture Department projections.

November crude shed 28 cents. There was no major news to account for crude\'s retreat. But analysts said the market is on the defensive following overbuying last week. Concerns over the impact of tropical hurricanes on U.S. crude production and supplies might have been exaggerated last week, leading to Monday\'s follow-through from Friday\'s correction, traders said. The threat from Hurricane Edouard, the Atlantic season\'s fourth hurricane, isn\'t fully removed, however, they added. Other observers said crude was pressured by traders\' delayed realization that Iraqi oil would soon hit the market. Among products, October gasoline lost 1.32 cent to 60.44 cents a gallon, pushed lower by reports that Tosco Corp. and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union had tentatively agreed to restart the former British Petroleum refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa., next year.

In the past few years, relentless world demand for the multipurpose metal has sopped up every pound of copper that producers could throw at the market. Now, however, as new mines open and others expand, the long-awaited increase in supply appears to be overtaking demand. ``We are now moving into a surplus situation\'\' that is likely to push copper prices lower, says Williemae Gonzalez, head of research for Rudolf Wolff & Co., a London metals-trading firm owned by Canada\'s natural-resources giant Noranda Inc.. After a few years of supply shortfalls, world copper output of about 10.5 million metric tons will exceed consumption by as much as 250,000 metric tons this year, he expects. Others expect a smaller surplus, on the order of about 100,000 metric tons. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. Either way, it spells growing inventories. Indeed, copper stockpiles have recently turned higher after spending most of this year declining. On the London Metal Exchange, inventories have climbed to 271,675 metric tons, up from 224,100 metric tons in late July. So far, analysts say, the rise hasn\'t been enough to rattle prices. Copper\'s cash price closed at 92.1 cents, up 0.95 cent, Friday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Recent Rebound Copper has rebounded from a low of about 83 cents set in late June, after Sumitomo said its copper trader Bower Wyman had lost $1.8 billion from unauthorized trading. That news sparked speculation that Sumitomo had hoarded copper, and could unload it on the market and drive prices back down. Those fears have diminished, but ``there\'s still an element of concern relating to Sumitomo,\'\' says Johnetta Stokes, publisher of the Copper Journal, based in Huntington, N.Y. While Mr. Stokes is bearish on copper in the long term because of rising world production,\'\' things could heat up in the short term,\'\' he contends. Continued strong demand in such key markets as the U.S. and Asia could soon push prices back up to $1 a pound. However, should inventories continue to climb, ``we could then test the low that was made at the end of June, if not see lower numbers,\'\' he says. Copper traders have long expected the market to be swamped with new mine output, especially from South America. So far it hasn\'t happened. But new projects are helping to create a surplus. The big Escondida mine in Chile, for example, produced 410,800 metric tons of copper in the first half of this year, 84% higher than the same period last year, as its owners, led by Australia\'s Broken Hill Proprietary Co. and Britain\'s RTZ-CRA Group, completed a major expansion. Denver\'s Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. and Chile\'s Codelco produced their first copper at their El Abra mine joint venture in Chile on April 22, 2011 months earlier than first planned. ``We are ramping up smoothly,\'\' and the mine will be producing 500 million pounds, or more than 226,000 metric tons of copper, annually by early 2012 at a cost of 35 cents a pound, a Cyprus Amax spokesman says. Mines such as these are likely to increase the world copper surplus in 2012, perhaps to as much as 300,000 metric tons, analysts expect. If prices don\'t weaken soon, they will eventually, most believe, but another plunge probably isn\'t likely. ``The fundamentals should take prices down a little bit,\'\' says an official at a North American copper concern. Porfirio Congdon, RTZ-CRA\'s chief economist, says: ``A surplus of say, 200,000 or 300,000 tons would not be unmanageable in the context of low inventory,\'\' adding that prices ``will be somewhere in the 80s during the course of 1997.\'\' Options as Safeguards That view has caused some companies to safeguard against lower copper prices. Cyprus Amax, for example, purchased options to ensure that much of its copper output for the rest of this year realizes at least 90 cents a pound, and secured the same minimum realization for most of El Abra\'s production next year. By contrast, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. in New Orleans, has taken a more bullish position on copper prices. The company recently sold options that had put a floor price of 90 cents on its copper sales for the next 10 months, under the assumption that the price protection is no longer necessary. If copper prices weaken, low-cost mines like El Abra will eventually displace some high-cost mines, analysts say, helping to keep world supply in check. Gibraltar Mines Ltd., in Williams Lake, British Columbia, last month blamed copper\'s recent price plunge for its inability to raise funding to develop its Lomas Bayas project in northern Chile. As more copper hits the market, analysts expect futures prices to return to a premium over cash prices, rather than the market\'s current ``backwardation,\'\' where futures prices are below cash prices. The copper market has long been in backwardation because there hasn\'t been much copper available, and so users have been willing to pay a premium for immediate supplies. The cash price of copper on the LME was 90 cents a pound Friday, while 15-month copper stood at 85.5 cents. ``It doesn\'t look as if demand is going to catch up with this increasing supply\'\' of copper, says Johnetta Haag, a mining analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto. ``I think the forward price (for 15-month copper) will probably stay in the mid-80s,\'\' and the cash price could fall ``to 80 cents or below.\'\'"},{"id":"04354","title":"Shares Fall, But Beat the Street","timestamp":"May 08, 2011","text":"The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index declined 6.30 to 5186.70, after gaining 10.90 Friday.

To the roar of Chinese lion dancers and celebratory fireworks, Mr. Currie on Monday cut the ribbon on his 1,980-megawatt coal-fired plant in southern China, which went into full commercial operation March 11, 2011 vice minister of electric power praised the Hong Kong businessman for finishing China\'s largest coal-fired power plant in just four years. It should have been a moment of glory for the engineer who became one of Asia\'s biggest builders of power plants by constructing them faster and cheaper than almost anyone else. Instead, Mr. Currie has seen his profit from the Shajiao C plant drastically slashed because his consortium failed to meet his own December 10, 2009 deadline that would have earned his companies US$400 million in extra profit. Under his contract, he would have collected nearly all the profit on any power sold before the official March 12, 2011 after the deadline China receives most of the profit. Mr. Currie, who manages Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd. and its parent, Hopewell Holdings Ltd., was counting on that money to compensate for the low price at which the plant sells electricity. The two companies now get a reduced bonus of ``tens of millions\'\' of U.S. dollars, says Hopewell director Layne Jankowski, which ``pales in comparison with what we had hoped to achieve.\'\' Mr. Currie is now locked in tough negotiations with his contractors over who is responsible for most of those delays. News of the project\'s holdups has hurt CEPA\'s share price, which has fallen by 28% from its peak a year ago to close at $13.70 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.77) on Friday. Completed after 48 months of breakneck construction, the Shajiao C plant exemplifies Mr. Currie\'s fast-track building style, which has made him one of Asia\'s top infrastructure players. The entrepreneur has been able to snap up power contracts in China, Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere by promising to sell low-cost electricity. To compensate, Mr. Currie counts on building the plants ahead of schedule and reaping a hefty windfall. But as the snags and setbacks at Shajiao C show, Mr. Currie\'s confidence in his ability to meet his own crushing deadlines proves to be an Achilles heel when he fails to snare his bonanza for fast construction. Even so, Mr. Currie managed to build the plant faster than any other coal-fired plant of similar size, says M.F. Bart, an official from GEC Alsthom SA, a member of the construction consortium. To save time and money, Mr. Currie, a Princeton-educated civil engineer, employed innovative construction techniques, such as building the walls of the 75-meter-tall plant with quickly poured cement instead of steel. And to make part of the station\'s foundation, Mr. Currie recycled coal ash from an adjacent power plant. Although, Mr. Currie ``really pushed the envelope,\'\' says an engineer, problems outside his control threw a wrench into his program. Last year, when the generator\'s three huge turbines began to spin at speeds of 3,000 revolutions a minute, the blades on one of the rotors hit the side of its casing, says an engineer involved with the project. It took weeks to solve that problem and check the other two rotors for vibrations. If not for that holdup, says Hopewell\'s Mr. Jankowski, the facility would have started generating electricity by March 11, 2010 GEC Alsthom manufactured the turbines, and Mr. Currie hopes to collect US$100 million or more of his missed early completion bonus from the company. The two sides have been negotiating for several months and aren\'t expected to reach an agreement anytime soon. The money would help make up for the plant\'s low electricity price of about 5.6 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour. In contrast, Hong Kong\'s largest power company sells electricity for about 9.3 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour, according to Salomon Brothers Hong Kong Ltd.. Even without the turbine problems, Mr. Currie would have failed to meet his ambitious target by three months or more because of the numerous glitches that usually crop up with such a huge project. At one point, snags developed with the conveyor belt that will feed six million tons of coal annually to the plant\'s furnaces. In an interview last year, Mr. Currie said, ``I feel frustrated I can\'t help much\'\' to solve problems with the rotors and conveyor belt because they were outside his area of expertise. As a result of the delays at Shajiao C and other CEPA projects in Indonesia and the Philippines, many analysts have reduced their profit forecasts for CEPA. Eric Savage, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, predicts that CEPA will report a profit of HK$589 million -- including HK$51 million in operating profit from Shajiao C -- for the year ended March 12, 2011 A year ago, Salomon Brothers expected CEPA to report a HK$1.29 billion profit, boosted by HK$463 million in operating profit from Bow C. Mckeehan, CEPA\'s projects in Indonesia and the Philippines also have been falling behind schedule. In September 2009, Mr. Currie signed an agreement to build two 660-megawatt generators in Central Java. These can\'t be completed by 2013 as planned because several issues -- including electricity pricing, financing and land use -- haven\'t been resolved. Construction hasn\'t started, and Salomon Brothers predicts that the project won\'t be completed until after 2015. In the Philippines, CEPA completed its Pagbilao project early but couldn\'t sell electricity ahead of schedule because the Philippine government hadn\'t built transmission lines. The company\'s 1,200-megawatt Sual project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2014, at least three months behind the original schedule, says Salomon Brothers. --Staff reporters Ricki Haugen and Jone Arroyo contributed to this article."},{"id":"04453","title":"Stocks Gain on Sunny Outlook","timestamp":"May 09, 2011","text":"The broad measure All Share Index climbed 59 points to 6616, pushed higher by a robust Industrial Index which soared 75 points to 7799.

Tuesday\'s gains -- the third in the past four sessions -- appears to confirm the end of the JSE\'s two-week slide, traders said. Remarks Tuesday by Christa Mcgowan, the Reserve Bank governor, about the need for continued tight monetary policy and the unlikelihood of an imminent hike in official interest rates, served to buttress the sunnier outlook. Equity advances were broad-based and punctuated by the return of institutional buying from offshore and locally. Futures dealers were also seen in the hunt for physical stocks. Among active counters, steelmaker Iscor slumped 4 cents to 2.71 rand on almost 4 million shares traded. Investors drove the stock to a fresh 2011 low of 2.65 rand during the session, unimpressed by the use of exceptional items to boost the company\'s net profit 9.6% to 853 million rand in the year to March 12, 2011 tobacco group Rembrandt gained 1.15 rand to 36.25 rand and heavily-weighted conglomerate South African Breweries collected 2.75 rand to 124.25 rand. The gold board extended its gains to almost 90 points since last Thursday, with foreigners supplying much of the share interest Tuesday. Spot gold offered support, vigorously clinging to the $389.00 an ounce level, but showed signs of a decline shortly after local trading. Traders also pointed to generally improving prices for other precious metals for the continuing rally. Western Hirt Alvera was among the big winners, rallying 5 rand to 170 rand following good demand for the stock in overnight New York trading.

Toronto underperformed Downtown, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.38 to 5711.27, helped by gains in bonds, analyst said. Overall, 12 of the TSE\'s 14 stock groups fell, with the 1.64% drop in the pipeline sector representing the steepest decline. In the sector, TransCanada Pipelines fell 0.35 to 21.75, after Monday\'s gain of 0.50. The group\'s sell-off resulted from an end to buying pressure created Monday by broker Nesbitt Burns Inc., said Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.. Nesbitt Burns bought up pipeline stocks Monday in order to create a security based on the pipeline group stocks, as a way of appealing to investors interested in either capital gains or dividends, Mr. Mantooth said. But Tuesday ``that buying pressure was out of the market,\'\' Mr. Mantooth said. Gold stocks also weighed down the market, with the sector dropping 0.58% following weakness in the underlying gold price.

Canada\'s main wheat crop, spring wheat, is expected to increase 27% this year from 2010 to 892.8 million bushels, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said. Spring wheat is seeded in the spring and harvested in the fall. Canada\'s total wheat production, which also includes winter wheat and durum wheat, is expected to total 1.10 billion bushels, the largest crop since 1992. Farmers, encouraged by higher grain prices, boosted their seeded acreage of wheat by 15% this year, Statistics Canada said. Higher yields are also expected to contribute to the increase in wheat production. Canada\'s 2011 barley crop is expected to increase by 25% to 746.8 million bushels, a record harvest. Tight world supplies of barley and strong demand for feed grains by livestock farmers fueled an increase in Canada\'s barley acreage this year. Barley is the country\'s main feed grain. Canola production is expected to drop by 17% to 235.3 million bushels, as farmers reduced their canola acreage to make way for wheat and barley.

The weather will help develop crops, which are not strong enough to withstand a normal or early frost.

Th...","full_text":"Is the Texas drought all dried up? In recent weeks, thunderstorms have rumbled across the state with increasing regularity, feeling -- dare anyone say it? -- almost like normal late-summer weather. The welcome rains have invigorated thirsty crops, greened up lawns and taken the edge off the summer\'s hottest days. And late last week, the offspring of Hurricane Dolly brought downpors to the scorched regions of South and Central Texas. For the first time in a long while, many farmers and other residents are seeing some relief. And for some, it\'s more than just a respite: They are declaring the worst of the drought over. As evidence, they say rainfall is some regions is keeping pace with annual averages for this time of year. And supporting their conviction: Meteorologists are downgrading forecasts of the drought\'s duration and severity, and economists are lowering estimates of 2011 crop damage. Before turning off the sprinkler, however, a dry word of caution: The optimists are in the minority. The entire state is still officially drought-stricken, with all regions in some stage of drought, ranging from mild to extreme, according to a National Weather Service index. What\'s more, most Texas meteorologists remain pessimistic. They say the state is so far behind in rainfall that it\'s going to take a rainstorm of Old Testament proportions -- or at least several months of above-average rainfall -- to pull the state out of its dry hole. Part of the split opinion can be explained this way: The drought means different things to different people. Georgeanna Quintanilla, meteorologist for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, distinguishes between the visible and invisible drought. The visible, or agricultural, drought has eased across much of Texas -- that can be seen in the healthier crops, lusher pastures and greener lawns. But the invisible drought -- the one that has drained water tanks and reservoirs and dried out soil deep in the earth -- remains as bad as ever, he says. So many meteorologists, who look at things like deep-soil moisture, consider the drought as bad as ever even as farmers making record crops declare it gone. Still, just the fact that anybody is optimistic is a far cry from a short time ago. ``As far as I\'m concerned, it\'s over,\'\' says Bret Livingston, a soil expert for the state agricultural extension service in Amarillo. He observes that the Panhandle is running about even with the 14 inches of rain that\'s normal for the year up to this date -- nearly all of it coming since the end of May. The Panhandle\'s recent rainfall has been the most dramatic turnaround in the state. In fact, a drought-management conference in the region planned for May 04, 2011 canceled when it was deemed no longer necessary. Masterson Jimmy Billy Andrea knows the exact date the first rains brought relief to his parched pastures in Lipscomb and Hemphill counties: February 03, 2011 he speaks of the drought in the past tense. ``It was deep and long,\'\' he says. ``But the turnaround was just as dramatic as the drought.\'\' Jayme Conklin, president of Boatmen\'s First Canadian Bank in the Panhandle, says ranchers are now enjoying the ``problem\'\' of finding enough cattle to feed on their green pastures, or someone to harvest their ample fields of hay (currently, there\'s a six-week waiting period for harvesting because hay balers can\'t keep up with demand for their services). Similar relief, though not quite as bountiful, has reached much of West and North Central Texas. Mr. Quintanilla, the meteorologist, attended a recent drought meeting in Sherman near the Oklahoma border, and says it\'s hard to tell it\'s August in the region. ``This year it\'s as green as a tropical rain forest up there,\'\' he says. Some of the numbers do look good for Texas. Projections based on the official drought index used by the National Weather Service -- which measures rainfall, evaporation rates and soil moisture -- improved dramatically all across Texas in just two months. For instance, in May, North Texas was given a 75% likelihood of remaining in a moderate to severe drought for the next three months; Central Texas had a 70% chance. But by July, the probability for the next three months had dropped to 54% for the Northern region, and 57% for Central Texas -- and that was before much of the recent rains began. In another indication that the worst may be over, dire projections of huge drought-related agricultural losses made at the start of summer were softened last week to reflect the rainfall. Agricultural economists at Texas A&M University now expect drought losses for producers to reach $2.1 billion this year, compared with estimates of $2.4 billion originally. Since more than two-thirds of those losses had already occurred when the new figures were calculated, the revision shows the dramatic improvement in the crop outlook for the remainder of the year. Perhaps the biggest sigh of relief comes from the Plains region of West Texas. There, losses are now expected to be only about $179 million, down from the nearly $500 million expected three months ago. Lloyd Urban, director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, attests that he went on an agricultural tour of the area in mid-August and ``saw some of the best cotton I\'ve ever seen in my life.\'\' The recent rains, agrees Carlee Andrea, a Texas A&M economist and cotton specialist, ``more or less saved the day\'\' in West Texas. ``Let\'s hope this is the beginning of the breaking of the drought.\'\' So how, amid all these signs, do the more-pessimistic meteorologists and state officials see it? Agricultural bankers point out that even in the now-lush Thomsen, heavy losses from the record dry spell won\'t be washed away by the rain. Financing will still be tough next year as bankers review farmers\' and ranchers\' operations that have lost an average 40% of their equity in one year. And some water and agricultural experts caution against feeling too good about the wetting Texas has been getting. In the first place, not everyone has gotten the rain. South and Central Texas continue to suffer mightily. Even where rain has fallen, it isn\'t enough to make much of a dent in the deep-seated drought. ``Yes, we\'re still in a severe drought,\'\' says Treena Wilton, a Texas A&M soil professor and chairman of the state drought committee, who notes that even droughts can have their wet spells. Though the experts concede the recent rains are more in tune with Texas\' normal weather for this time of year, they still don\'t see a major shift in the long-term weather patterns that caused the drought. Based on that, Johnetta Arevalo, the state\'s official climatologist, says, ``I don\'t see any clues that the drought is coming to an end.\'\' The recent rains, adds Mr. Quintanilla, the meteorologist, ``can be viewed only as a respite.\'\' Even Agricultural Commissioner Rickie Petra, who might be expected to take the sunnier view of the farmers and ranchers, is among those stressing the worst. Instead of highlighting the improved outlook for agriculture, Mr. Petra emphasizes the devastation of the drought. ``Summer rains have given us a reprieve, but certainly not a pardon,\'\' he says. ``We hope this is the start of a weather pattern change ... But we don\'t know. I\'m going to be very cautious in saying this is the end of the 1990s drought.\'\' Political motives may lurk behind the officials\' responses, some skeptics say: Texas is still trying to gain disaster status for several Texas counties. But Evelynn Browning-Easton blames official pessimism on something else: ego. Ms. Browning-Alter, who produces a weather forecasting newsletter in Sandia Park, N.M., for the Southwest U.S., says some officials and meteorologists may continue to stress the worst-case scenario because they\'re enjoying the limelight. ``There\'s a lot of people who have gotten a lot of glory because they\'ve been involved in drought relief,\'\' she says. Mr. Petra responds that there is no political advantage is stressing the bad, noting that politicians usually benefit more when they can say things are going well. As for disaster declarations, he says those are based on damages that have already occurred, so a change in drought status wouldn\'t affect those efforts. Mr. Petra says he is pessimistic because he sees too many parallels between this drought and the seven-year drought of the \'50s. But Ms. Browning-Alter looked at history and came to another conclusion. She analyzed five years with similar weather conditions and found that in four of those years, rains came by August. And in three of the years, ``the drought was pretty much over by autumn,\'\' she says. Ms. Browning-Easton was one of the earliest optimists on the Texas drought. In early June she predicted to a meeting of ranchers in Corpus Christia that the drought would begin easing in August as more normal rainfall returned to the state. ``Most people were asking ``Will there be rain?\'\' \'\' she recalls. ``So I went there and said, `Yes, there will be rain.\' \'\' There is hope for the months ahead. September and October are traditionally the state\'s best rainfall months as tropical storm systems from the Gulf butt heads with cold fronts descending from the north. The result is usually many days of widespread, heavy rains -- just the kind needed to break the drought. Whether that happens this year remains to be seen. In the meantime, there\'s a good chance that the drought picture will continue to be confusing to many. ``That\'s the funny thing about the drought,\'\' says Prof. Wilton of Texas A&M. ``You can\'t say, `Yesterday I was in a drought but today I\'m not.\' It\'s kind of hard to say when the end of it is.\'\'"},{"id":"00185","title":"Grain, Soybean Futures Retreat On Export Lag, Good Weather","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"Wheat futures prices settled lower Wednesday at the Chicago Board of Trade on concerns about rising supplies as exports lag.

Canada this week announced it expected a record-breaking wheat yield. Other countries also expect unusually large harvests, which means they will import less and export more. Their wheat is expected to be cheaper than U.S. grain. Traders shrugged off the morning announcement that Egypt had bought 100,000 tons of soft red winter wheat; the news already had been factored into the market, said Mikki Yuette at Pacific Futures Trading Co. in Seattle. Prices also fell on forecasts that good weather should allow the harvest to finish ahead of schedule. The weather reports also pushed corn and soybean futures lower as Midwestern crops are expected to thrive over the hot Labor Day weekend. Soybean prices were also pressured by profit-taking, as prices have dropped about 80 cents a bushel in the past three weeks. Wheat for December delivery fell 9 cents to $4.55 a bushel; December corn dropped 6 cents to $3.4275 a bushel; November soybeans lost 7 cents to $7.8875 a bushel. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude-oil futures prices settled higher Wednesday on the Downtown Mercantile Exchange, boosted by a jump in refinery-product prices. October crude oil rose 15 cents to $21.71 after retreating initially on larger-than-expected builds in inventories shown in the weekly reports, though the October contract quickly rebounded and followed the strength in products\' prices. September gasoline was the strongest member of the complex, settling at 62.33 cents a gallon, up 1.12 cents. Traders said much of the strength was short covering from recent bearish movement, as well as rolling of positions ahead of the spot products\' expiration on Friday. September heating oil ended at 62.04 cents, up 0.91 cent. The contract found some buying interest on the slightly bullish weekly inventory figures. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals lost ground Wednesday on the Comex division of the Downtown Mercantile Exchange, following the expiration of London gold and silver over-the-counter options early in the session. The sell-off in Downtown was only position-squaring, said Bettina Stivers, metals analyst with Prudential Securities in Downtown. December gold fell $1 to $393 an ounce. September silver shed 6.6 cents to $5.172 an ounce."},{"id":"01943","title":"Futures Investors Support Rise","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"Demand for top shelf South African issues, particularly in the industrial sector, pushed the All Share Index up 63 to 6679.

The Industrial Index gained 38 to 7837 and the All Gold index ended just 1 point higher at 1786. There was strong demand for index futures contracts during July and August while the equity market was being buffeted by losses on Wall Street, interest rate fears and a rand sliding to new lows. However, with anxieties about an interest-rate increase receding, equities now look set to rebound and provide better returns than their derivative cousins, analysts said. With sentiment becoming more bullish on South African, many futures traders who gambled on weaker stock prices are now scrambling to cover their exposures by chasing blue chips. Traders said that while South Africa\'s financial markets learned nothing new about the economy from a sweeping speech delivered Tuesday by Reserve Bank Governor Christa Mcgowan, he at least confirmed the opinion of many investors that interest rates aren\'t likely to increase any time soon. Another factor lifting the gloom from the equity market is a stronger performance by the rand. Late Wednesday, the dollar had retreated to 4.5091 rand from 4.5225 rand a day earlier as foreign investors began returning to the currency they so decidedly shunned only nine days ago. Anglo American jumped 8.25 rand 268, reflecting the strong demand for those shares with heavy weighting in Johannesburg Stock Exchange share indexes. The banking sector brightened considerably as the threat of an official rate increase eased, with all four of the major South African commercial banks showing gains. Nedcor climbed 2.75 rand to 62.25; Amalgamated Banks gained 25 South African cents to 20.80 rand; First National added 40 cents to 27.60 rand and Standard Bank jumped 4.50 rand to 172.50. Other stocks making ground included Anglo American Coal, which climbed 7.50 rand to 345; De Beers Consolidated Mines, which gained 4 rand at 136; and metals miner Samancor, which added 1.50 rand at 56.50. Bucking the day\'s upbeat trend was steel-maker Iscor, which announced this week that earnings are under pressure from falling sales and technical problems.

Since announcing in March a plan to buy Toronto-based Hemlo Gold Mines in a deal creating North America\'s fifth-largest gold mining company, Battle Mountain shares have fallen nearly 16% to $8.375. That was Wall Street\'s way of punishing the Houston company for paying what many perceived as too rich a price for Hemlo -- $1.5 billion in stock. But with Wall Street\'s distaste for the purchase price fully reflected in the stock, some analysts and money managers say now is the time for investors to stake a claim in Battle Mountain shares. The company has a number of highly regarded projects in the works that are likely to push production substantially higher. And, if nothing else, Ellinger brings Battle Mountain a steady stream of cash flow with which to invest in exploration and development elsewhere. ``Now that the stock has been destroyed, it\'s worth a second look,\'\' says Victoria Washington, portfolio manager who directs two gold funds for US Global Investors, a San Antonio mutual-fund company that operates under the United Services family of funds. Though Mr. Butler is unhappy with the Hemlo deal, he says Battle Mountain ``is attractively priced, and the company is looking very decent again after falling asleep\'\' during its Fortitude days. Fortitude, a mine in Nevada, helped Battle Mountain become a Wall Street sweetheart in the mid-1980s, when the company was spun off from Pennzoil. Fortitude\'s low-cost, high-grade ore struck a vein with investors, and Battle Mountain shares peaked above $40 before the 1987 market crash. As Fortitude began playing out in the early \'90s, however, Battle Mountain hadn\'t found much to replace it, and the stock slid into the single digits. Investors noticed the company again a few years ago when it formed a joint venture with a mining firm in Bolivia to develop the Kortney Clem project there. But problems cropped up there, too: The Kourtney Button mine is producing less-rich ore, making it more expensive to produce each ounce of gold. But now Mr. Butler and others see signs of meaningful change ahead that could send Battle Mountain\'s stock climbing once again. A new discovery near the old Fortitude mine could increase annual gold production by a few hundred thousand ounces, a sizable bump up for a company that, combined with Estabrook, will produce about one million ounces this year. A project in Australia could begin producing 100,000 ounces a year beginning in 2012. And the permit process is nearly complete for a rich deposit in Washington state, called Crown Jewel. The company could begin building that mine next spring. ``Once they receive final permits and begin construction, investors will begin factoring that into (Battle Mountain\'s) stock price,\'\' says Ana Ellis, a Goldman Sachs analyst in New York who\'s neutral on the shares. Ms. Ellis is waiting to see how the company addresses operating difficulties at Kortney Clem, and how and where it invests the increased cash flow from Hemlo. Battle Mountain\'s fortunes could also get a boost from its 50.5% investment in an Australian company, Niugini Mining. Through Niugini, Battle Mountain owns an 8.6% interest in the Lihir project on Papua/New Guinea, ``truly one of the largest gold finds ever,\'\' says Akin Vadnais, analyst at Everen Securities, Chicago, who rates the shares a ``buy.\'\' Mr. Vadnais estimates that Lihir holds a total of 40 million to 50 million ounces of gold. Getting to the gold will be a huge technical challenge, though. Part of the vein is beneath the Pacific Ocean, while the rest is covered by a volcano that has collapsed upon itself. The rock the companies must dig through is still blistering hot. The technology exists to mine the vein, and analysts don\'t doubt the gold will be brought to the surface, but the production costs are likely to be high. Ellinger, meanwhile, may not be such a bad fit, either. Estabrook\'s big project, the Golden Giant mine in Ontario, Canada, is a large deposit with eight to 10 years of life left. That will provide Battle Mountain with a stable flow of cash. Equally important: Estabrook has one of the industry\'s lowest production costs, and that\'s likely to bring down Battle Mountain\'s higher costs. With Ellinger as a springboard for growth, Mr. Vadnais sees Battle Mountain shares approaching $12 in the next year. But investors should be aware of what Mr. Butler calls ``wrinkles.\'\' Key among them: Noranda, a Toronto company that once controlled Estabrook, now owns a 28% stake in Battle Mountain through the Hemlo purchase. Noranda has said it is happy to be a Battle Mountain shareholder, but Mr. Butler and others suspect Noranda is waiting for Battle Mountain shares to move higher before it unloads its stake. Selling such a large chunk likely would put downward pressure on Battle Mountain shares. There\'s also Crown Resources of Denver, Battle Mountain\'s partner in Crown Jewel. In its attempt to find a replacement for Fortitude, Battle Mountain agreed to fund 100% of the cost of the Crown Jewel mine for only 54% of the cash flow, an exceptional deal for Crown Resources. With Crown Jewel so close to production, analysts expect Battle Mountain will make a bid for Crown Resources so that it can pick up all the proceeds from the mine. (Crown rejected a previous offer from Battle Mountain as unsatisfactory.) Mr. Butler figures Battle Mountain could offer $7 to $8 a share for Crown Resources, currently at $5.50, ``and it would still be cheaper than the current setup.\'\' Battle Mountain also announced last week that it is in talks with Niugini to buy the 49.5% stake it doesn\'t own, another loose end that needs to be tied up. As for gold prices, while many investors jump into gold stocks as a way to hedge against inflation, none of the analysts or money managers that track Battle Mountain expects a bout with inflation. However, Mr. Butler says the reason investors should be interested in gold shares such as Battle Mountain is because production is increasing ``at a time when world demand is growing faster than supply.\'\' Poor Reception: TSX, the El Paso maker of cable-television equipment, tumbled nearly 18% to $11.75 last week after posting net income of $3.5 million, or 22 cents a share, for the first quarter ended April 08, 2011 were expecting earnings of 25 cents a share.

Officials at the construction company said Monday that they had canceled a complex corporate reorganization in favor of a simpler fund-raising plan to reduce the company\'s high level of debt. Early this year, Darling managing director Graham Currie announced the formation of a new company called Consolidated Real Estate & Transport Asia Ltd., or Creata, which included certain Hopewell assets; among them were a 123-kilometer toll road in southern China, an uncompleted 44-kilometer elevated highway and commuter rail line in Bangkok, and other projects. Mr. Currie had planned to raise about HK$9 billion (US$1.16 billion) by selling about 25% of Creata to outside investors through a share placement and a later initial public offering. Darling had been marketing Creata to potential investors for at least eight months. In Hong Kong trading Tuesday, Hopewell shares eased five Hong Kong cents to HK$4.40 on the news that those efforts had been unsuccessful. Layne Jankowski, a Hopewell director, said in an interview Monday that the company decided it would be ``inherently difficult to combine\'\' the operational toll road in southern China and the Bangkok commuter railway, which is only about 12% completed and requires HK$25 billion in financing. Mr. Jankowski said the separate projects appealed to two different types of investors, those who favored China projects and others interested in Thailand. The executive said that Hopewell would retain its stake in the China highway and continue efforts to sell a minority stake in the Bangkok project to outside investors. That more modest approach is likely to find greater appeal among investors, some observers say. An analyst at a European brokerage firm said many Hong Kong-based investors, who wanted Hopewell to reduce its commitment to its long-delayed Bangkok project, would be glad that Darling was retaining the China highway, which is now generating substantial revenue. ``Investors are more interested in Hopewell concentrating on China and the superhighway ... (than) on the Bangkok project, which needs a lot of money.\'\' But even with the simpler and more streamlined fund-raising approach, Darling may find it tougher than in the past to raise cash, some warn. Stephine Correa, a fund manager at AIG Investment Corp. (Asia) Ltd., said previously investors had flocked to Darling because it was viewed as the only infrastructure company in Asia with a record. Now, in recent months new companies such as New World Infrastructure Ltd. and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. have grabbed the limelight. ``Darling has been off the radar screen for some time,\'\' Mr. Correa. said."},{"id":"03478","title":"Shares Rise in Volatile Trading","timestamp":"May 10, 2011","text":"The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 40.56 to 11379.49, while the broader All Ordinaries Index rose 14.42 to 5457.88.

Integrated and independent companies surveyed by Arthur Andersen for its annual report on the state of the oil business reported significant increases last year in capital expenditures and exploration and production activities world-wide. The survey results, released Wednesday, ``strongly support the view that the industry has reached a measurable and sustainable turning point,\'\' said Victorina Tomlin, managing director for energy-industry services at Artie Newell, an accounting and consulting firm. ``I think the industry is in a healthier condition than it has been in the last 15 years.\'\' Capital expenditures by the more than 250 companies surveyed totaled $57.8 billion in 2010, a 12% increase from 2009. Spending on exploration and development was up 10% to $50.4 billion, with allocations in the U.S. rising 8% to $17.3 billion. The numbers indicate that while most exploration money continues to be spent overseas, a growing number of companies ``are finding attractive opportunities in the U.S.,\'\' largely in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. Tomlin said. Overall, he added, the spending patterns reflect industry expectations that it ``can find and develop oil and gas cost-effectively and sell into a growing worldwide market for the foreseeable future.\'\' In the U.S. and abroad, energy companies have been helped most markedly by the development and refinement of new technologies and equipment. The survey found that the cost of producing a barrel of oil in the U.S. last year averaged just $4, down 5% from 2009 and 19% from 1991. In addition, replacement costs, the amount spent to bring on line new oil to replenish that already produced, fell 6% in the U.S. to $4.22 a barrel, the lowest since 1987. Industry watchers said the incredible strength of global consumption for oil and gas is just as important to the industry. ``Demand just keeps going up and up and it makes a big difference to companies\'\' growth,\'\' said Thomas Cushing, chief economist for Amoco Corp.. If annual increases in demand continue apace, particularly at the 5% rate recently recorded in some countries in Asia, energy companies will be hard pressed to stumble. But a dip in oil and gas prices could arrest the industry\'s expansion. ``Prices are key,\'\' said Kenyatta Halley, Chevron Corp.\'s chief economist. ``If prices fall, investment falls.\'\' Mr. Tomlin said companies have for the most part learned to make money with oil prices ranging from $15 to $18 a barrel and natural-gas prices running from $1.60 to $1.80 per-thousand-cubic feet.

U.S. supplies of distillate also remain low, with the American Petroleum Institute putting the figure at 105.654 million barrels, about 19 million barrels below the year-ago level. In addition, traders said, prices may have seen a boost on allegations that Iran had helped Iraq smuggle some illegal gas-oil exports, though Iran has officially denied the charges. Traders said any illegal shipments could threaten the U.N. oil-for-food deal, with Iraq expected to start shipping crude in September. Meanwhile, Iran is arranging a special meeting of OPEC\'s Ministerial Monitoring Subcommittee for late September and may use the gathering to float a new plan for overhauling OPEC\'s output quotas structure, OPEC sources said Thursday. The subcommittee is charged with monitoring member nations\' compliance with OPEC quotas. OPEC has a 25.03-million-barrel-a-day output ceiling for its 11 members through the end of 2011, but output has been independently estimated at as high as 25.85 million barrels per day. In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices ended mostly higher Thursday at the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from early weakness amid some concerns over dry conditions in the Midwest. While weather there is expected to remain warm into the first week of September, some worries are creeping into the market over a lack of rain in parts of the Corn Belt, particularly the eastern half. The latest 6- to 10-day forecast for May 16, 2011 the National Weather Service called for normal to above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal precipitation for most Corn Belt states. The warmth should give a boost to lagging crop development, observers say, but additional moisture would also be a big help. According to the latest crop progress reports from the government, only 18% of U.S. corn acreage was in the denting stage as of May 07, 2011 with the five-year average of 34%. Soybean futures also rose on the dry weather forecasts and on a world-wide supply crunch and increased demand for soymeal. Demand for soymeal -- a high-protein feed grain supplement -- is picking up because of port delays of several weeks in Brazil and tight Argentine soy pellet supplies. Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $4.56 a bushel; December corn gained 1.75 cents to $3.445 a bushel; November soybeans gained 6.25 cents to $7.95 a bushel, and October soybean meal rose $3.60 to $258.20 a ton.

With futures contracts due to expire in September, some local market participants are scrambling to buy blue-chip stocks to protect them from index futures contracts whose premiums will make them too expensive to roll over. Observers noted an improvement in sentiment after the issue of July balance of trade data early Thursday that showed a stunning turnaround in South Africa\'s trade position. The trade balance swung sharply to a surplus of 2.58 billion rand in July from a deficit of 27.6 million rand in June. Some economists attribute this remarkable turnaround to the vagaries of collecting export and import data, while others point to the delayed recording of diamond sales, most likely from Botswana. Among actively traded shares, market leader Anglo American Corp. gained 2 to close at 270 rand a share, having announced late Wednesday that it plans to sell most of a 47% stake in Johnnies Industrial Corp., currently shared between itself and De Beers Consolidated Mines.

Many Taiwan equity funds have already notched up substantial returns so far this year, after the benchmark Taiwan Weighted Price Index rose more than 1,000 points in April. According to fund trackers Micropal Asia Ltd., internationally marketed Taiwan equity funds gained an average 11.1% in U.S. dollar terms through the end of last week. But along with the climbs came sudden falls. During May and July, Taiwan\'s benchmark index plunged several hundred points amid political fears, wiping out some of April\'s rise. Last week, the index tumbled more than 180 points in one session on news that Taiwan\'s vice president and premier, Ligia Chanda, had made a surprise visit to Europe. ``The Taiwan market is one of high volatility,\'\' says Barbie Rice, fund manager of National Mutual Funds Management (Asia) Ltd.\'s Taiwan fund. ``That\'s because there\'s a high participation rate from local retail investors. Politics also really sways the market.\'\' Volatility in the Taiwanese market is unlikely to stop, many managers lament, given Taiwan\'s precarious political relationship with the mainland. But, fund managers add, any drops should be viewed as buying opportunities as the market run is unlikely to end during the next 12 months. ``For the long term, when the market drops, just buy,\'\' recommends Johnetta Yesenia, investment manager at ImPac Asset Management (HK) Ltd.. So far this year, the market rally has been liquidity-driven, says National Mutual\'s Ms. Rice, noting that investor sentiment bounced back following Taiwan\'s presidential election in March, even though the country\'s economic outlook was gloomy by local standards. Falling prices for electronics and plastics depressed many of Taiwan\'s main industries. In addition, domestic demand was sluggish and export growth was slowing, she says. The Taiwanese economy is now bottoming, however. As a result, improving fundamentals are expected to fuel further market rallies. Ms. Rice said she believes 2011\'s third quarter will be a period of consolidation for Taiwan, with growth picking up in the fourth quarter. ImPac\'s Mr. Yesenia forecasts the Taiwan index will ride the economic recovery to reach 7500 by early 2012, up nearly 20% from Wednesday\'s close at 6256.76. Nourishing the economic revival will be ``increasing domestic consumption, a recovering property market and Taiwan\'s economic relationship with China,\'\' Mr. Yesenia says. The numbers are already looking up. Ching Beaty Wolfson, senior investment manager at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong Ltd., notes fourth-quarter growth in gross domestic product is forecast to be 6.5%, compared with just 4.9% in the year-earlier period. Corporate-earnings growth is also expected to improve, with ImPac\'s Mr. Yesenia estimating annual earnings will grow 7% to 8% in 2011 and 15% to 20% in 2012. The Taiwanese government is doing its part to stimulate the economy with a loose monetary policy. What\'s more, foreign cash is expected to flood in next month. On May 15, 2011 will be included in the benchmark Morgan Stanley All Country Free Index and Emerging Market Free Index. ``Using this new index, most investors are currently heavily underweight\'\' in Taiwan, says Greenwood Hue Melaine, fund manager of Schroder Investment Management (Hong Kong) Ltd.\'s Taiwan fund. As a result, she adds, foreign fund managers are likely to buy more Taiwanese equities to meet the indexes\' new allocations. But what are they purchasing? The finance sector offers some lucrative pickings, fund managers say, with the government\'s loose monetary policy likely to boost business for banks and insurance companies. One favorite is Cathay Life Insurance Co., Taiwan\'s largest insurer. ImPac\'s Mr. Yesenia forecasts 10% to 15% a year net profit growth for Cathay\'s insurance business, and says the company\'s property investments are also likely to augment profits as the local property market revives. Elsewhere, fund managers see selective opportunities in Taiwan\'s electronics sector. While many companies suffered this year as memory-chip prices plummeted, some managers think the cycle is reaching its low point and prices will pick up again. Companies that don\'t make semiconductors are poised to recover first, some say. HSBC\'s Ms. Wolfson points to PC components makers Compeq Manufacturing Co. and Yageo Corp. as favorites."},{"id":"00117","title":"Foreign Buying Lifts Shares","timestamp":"May 11, 2011","text":"The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index added 55.67 to 6312.43 on volume of 1.15 billion shares.

October crude oil settled at $22.25 a barrel, up 10 cents, after remaining inside a narrow trading range during the session. Little news emerged to influence prices during the day, contributing to the thin conditions. Many market players were also absent Friday ahead of the holiday Labor Day weekend.

Wheat futures finished lower. Trading was largely influenced by conflicting views about weather conditions during the long holiday weekend. Most Midwestern growing areas are expected to have modest temperatures, but some investors are concerned about a lack of significant moisture in the eastern Corn Belt. Wheat futures retreated after the International Grains Council forecast world wheat production at 563 million tons this year, up from a previous forecast of 560 million tons.

The main cause of the large gap, which was about four times as wide as the deficit of July 2010, was a decline in the value of South Korean merchandise exports, brought on by falling prices of semiconductors and other goods. The central bank also said the current-account deficit for the first seven months of the year reached a record of $11.66 billion, up 44% from the comparable period a year earlier. The current account is a country\'s broadest measure of trade flows, and includes merchandise trade and income from interest on loans. Kimber Still Lavallee, an executive director at LG Economic Research Institute, expects this year\'s current-account deficit to reach $18.1 billion, more than twice last year\'s $8.9 billion. ``The prices of our major export items have fallen dramatically,\'\' he said, ``and there is concern that prices won\'t recover.\'\' Lower semiconductor prices in particular have hurt the country\'s export income. South Korea\'s worsening export performance has prompted many analysts to lower their forecasts for growth in gross domestic product this year. Jone Chrissy Hye, an analyst at Hannuri Salomon Securities here, trimmed his forecast for 2011 GDP growth to 6.5% from 8%. Last year the economy grew 9%. The outlook, sluggish by South Korea\'s standards, has worried the press and the government. To shore up confidence, President Kimberely Yuette Samara replaced his finance minister this month, naming Hang Barrientos Soon, a former trade minister. There are some bright spots, however. Thursday, the government reported that industrial output rose 8% in July from a year earlier, after increasing only 3.8% in June. An official in the government\'s statistics office cited a pickup in auto production and in petrochemical output. Analysts differ on when economic growth will speed up, but generally predict a turnaround by late next year, helped by an expected stabilization in prices of dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAMs. ``It\'s hard to predict,\'\' says Mr. Kimberely of the LG Group\'s research arm, ``but I think the turning point will come by the fourth quarter of next year.\'\'"},{"id":"03915","title":"Profit-Taking Weakens Shares","timestamp":"May 12, 2011","text":"The Hang Seng Index dropped 169.19 to 11159.02, while the broader All Ordinaries Index slid 68.04 to 5367.65.

In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in October settled at $21.99 per barrel, up $1.21, at the International Petroleum Exchange. U.S. financial markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. ``Oil prices will remain strong well into next year if the freeze on Iraqi oil remains, and OPEC countries do not raise their production levels,\'\' said Leoma Ballance, deputy-director of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. Analysts predicted prices would climb to $21 a barrel. The average price of a barrel of oil, as measured by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been around $19 in 2011, compared with $17 in 2010 and $15.5 a year earlier. Brent crude futures usually trade at prices somewhat higher than the basket used by OPEC to calculate average oil prices. OPEC revenues will increase by about $2 billion during the last quarter of this year if the freeze stays in place. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer inside the 11-member cartel, would benefit most, Mr. Ballance said. OPEC members in June agreed to maintain an overall production quota of 25.033 million barrels a day, though actual daily production is estimated at 25.6 million barrels. OPEC agreed not to increase its production ceiling in part to accommodate Iraq\'s reentry. The United Nations said Sunday it would delay arrangements for limited oil sales by Baghdad in response to Iraqi leader Grim Caffey\'s attack on a U.N.-policed safe haven in northern Iraq over the weekend. The U.N. deal, signed more than three months ago, allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months in order to buy food and medicine for its people, hard-hit by six years of U.N. trade sanctions. Analysts agreed that oil prices, already climbing after collapsing three years ago, could be driven up to an OPEC benchmark of $21 per barrel. Mr. Ballance said higher prices could tempt OPEC members, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to raise output or push for a higher overall production ceiling at the cartel\'s scheduled meeting in November. ``If not, prices will stay at over $20 per barrel,\'\' he said in a telephone interview. Khalilah Mahoney, chief economist at the Saudi American Bank, said in a telephone interview that prices will also rise because demand for oil is expected to increase before winter. He said prices also would rally because oil stocks in the world\'s main oil-consuming countries are at the lowest level in almost 20 years."},{"id":"03870","title":"Stocks Fall in Light Trading","timestamp":"May 15, 2011","text":"The Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 7.23 to 774.26.

Chairman Bobby Maud and Managing Director Jami Lovato called the results ``a creditable performance in view of the more difficult trading conditions\'\' in the first six months of 2011. Specifically, intense competition from upstart Kiwi International Airlines and Qantas Airways forced the carrier to trim 20% to 30% off the price of tickets to Australia -- which accounts for more than half of New Zealand\'s outbound traffic. Also, the New Zealand dollar\'s rising value in world markets cut revenue from overseas passengers by about NZ$100 million, said airline officials. The New Zealand dollar was traded at 68.3 U.S. cents on March 12, 2011 with 66.6 cents a year earlier. Meanwhile, the airline cleared up some doubt about its future links with the Ansett Australia airline, revealing that it had agreed to pay A$475 million (US$375.3 million) for TNT Ltd.\'s 50% stake in Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd.. Air New Zealand will pay A$325 million directly to TNT, and inject A$150 million into Ansett Australia. The acquisition, announced after the stock market closed, still requires the consent of Australia\'s Foreign Investment Review Board. Air New Zealand directors and Brierley Investments Ltd. -- which owns 42% of Air New Zealand -- have already approved the offer. ``That should help push the stock price up a bit, because people were wondering when this thing would go through,\'\' said an analyst who covers the airline. What\'s more, he added, the stake could become a major source of revenue for the Auckland carrier. Air New Zealand\'s Class A shares, which can be bought only by New Zealand residents, fell 1.3%, or four New Zealand cents, to NZ$3.14 on Monday. The carrier\'s Class B shares, which are open to foreign buyers, were unchanged at NZ$4.33. The airline\'s results were generally in line with market expectations. ``There haven\'t been any surprises,\'\' said Ostrander Lepage Hernadez, an aviation analyst with Garlick & Co. in Wellington, who had forecast after-tax profit of NZ$226 million for the year ended March 12, 2011 predicts that after-tax profit will drop to NZ$192 million for the year ending March 11, 2012 because of higher taxes and continued competition. Even so, Mr. Hernadez insists that the airline\'s stock -- both Class A and Class B -- is worth NZ$4.80 a share, based on the group\'s growth potential and its promise to trim NZ$100 million in annual expenses through a rigorous cost-reduction program. ``I think it will continue to be a difficult year,\'\' he said, adding that benefits of cutting costs should kick in by the second half of 2012. Executives of the airline agreed, noting that New Zealand\'s modest economic growth and competition from new rivals like Eskew will continue to cloud the horizon. ``Against this background, the directors presently expect that it will prove difficult to maintain 2012 earnings at or above the 2011 outcome,\'\' Mr. Maud and Mr. Lovato said. Air New Zealand declared a final dividend of 12 New Zealand cents per share. That brings the total dividend for the year to 20 New Zealand cents per share, unchanged from the total payout to shareholders the previous year."},{"id":"00972","title":"HEARD IN SOUTH AFRICA South Africa\'s Sasol Is Expected To Outgun Its Only Rival, Engen","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa\'s oil analysts can find as many reasons to praise the prospects of fuel and chemical producer Sasol Ltd. as they can to downplay those of its only listed riv...","full_text":"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa\'s oil analysts can find as many reasons to praise the prospects of fuel and chemical producer Sasol Ltd. as they can to downplay those of its only listed rival, Engen Ltd.. Most onlookers expect a continued rise in Sasol shares, but the outlook for Engen -- seen as an ideal merger partner for Sasol -- is considered dim despite its recent tie-up with Malaysia\'s Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas. ``Sasol will outperform the market, and Engen will underperform,\'\' said Christa Hornback, analyst at brokerage Ivor Jones, Roy & Co.. Economists point to the oil producers\' differing profiles to account for their contrasting outlooks, which are reflected in the movement of the respective share prices since the beginning of the year. Sasol stock settled Friday in Johannesburg at an all-time peak of 50.00 rand, up 1.30 rand, or 2.7%, from the previous session and up 68% so far in 2011. Engen closed at 26.25 rand, down 70 cents, or 2.6%, and off 5.4% since the beginning of the year. The broad-measure All Share index has gained 7.4% over the same period. Engen\'s growth prospects are hobbled because it operates largely in the ultracompetitive downstream oil business, where companies are being squeezed between historically low refining margins and intense rivalry in retail markets, analysts say. Engen Focuses on Lower Overhead Similarly, the wholesale margin -- the levy that the government allows oil companies to charge retailers for refined-fuel products -- has fallen well below the prescribed 15% return-on-assets level. Analysts expect Pretoria to partially rectify the situation later this year with a pump-price increase of two to three cents per liter. Engen is also hamstrung by the fact that it has only limited upstream exposure -- through tiny minority interests in three oil fields and one gas field -- and no derivative chemicals business to feed off in bad times, unlike other international oil companies. Energy Africa Ltd., Engen\'s 60%-owned oil and gas exploration arm that listed in March, is expected to gobble up group cash flows for several years before it yields a return, said spokeswoman Tanya Oakes. And Engen\'s biggest asset, its 104,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Durban, is operating below capacity and is frequently the target of power outages. ``Its efficiencies are not up to industry standards,\'\' said Mr. Hornback of Villanueva Davis. The Petronas acquisition in June of 30% of Engen\'s equity for 1.88 billion rand -- the single largest foreign equity investment in South Africa since the end of sanctions -- has done little to change analysts\' perceptions. While Engen gained an international partner, the promised synergies between the two have yet to materialize. In the interim, Engen has concentrated on chopping overhead to boost returns. In the last two years, it has slashed its work force by almost 1,000, or 26%. Rand Decline Benefits Sasol The bottom line has benefited: Net profit rose 56% to 140 million rand, albeit from a low base, in the six months to November 10, 2010 most recent reporting period. But Engen warned that second-half results will be worse. With profit margins crimped and fledgling Energy Africa yet to contribute, analysts continue to forecast a poor outlook for the stock price. Sasol, on the other hand, has become a stock picker\'s darling. ``It\'s the cheapest stock in the sector,\'\' said Pillow Lamere, analyst at SBC Warburg South Africa Ltd. ``It is low-risk, high-yield.\'\' Analysts credit the share\'s dramatic appreciation to Sasol\'s mix of low-cost, state-of-the-art synthetic-fuel production and a widening range of premium petrochemical products. Sasol also has benefited from the rand\'s depreciation since mid-February, as almost 80% of revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. Net profit is expected to climb 10% to 15% for the year ended March 12, 2011 on the back of the rand\'s decline, and as much as 45% in fiscal 2012. ``Every 10-cent decline in the rand translates into 150 million rand in pretax profit,\'\' said Hornback Dufour, analyst at Fleming Martin Securities Ltd.. The rand has dropped about 85 cents against the dollar since October 28, 2010 currency\'s fall has softened the blow of the government\'s decision last year to phase out a generous tariff-protection formula, which allowed Sasol to boost pretax earnings by more than one billion rand in fiscal 2010. Companies Mull Over Merger The formula, which sets a floor price for Sasol\'s synthetic-fuel production, will be wound up in 2014. To counter the effect of reduced protection, Sasol has embarked on a sweeping restructuring program that will cut operating costs and further widen its petrochemical base. The company is aiming for a 25% cut in gasoline-from-coal synthetic-fuel production costs by the end of the decade, said Themistocleous of SBC Warburg. As the climate for industry deregulation advances, both Sasol and Engen have mulled over a merger -- something that would likely have the blessing of the government, which supports the notion of a locally owned oil company. Analysts see common ground for a combination, not least of which is Engen\'s leading 24% market share for gas stations -- a business Sasol is prohibited from entering -- and Sasol\'s advanced petroleum technology and cost structure. Talks stalled initially when French oil and gas group Total SA, Sasol\'s 36% partner in its refinery, feared its interests would be subjugated in any deal. While Swiger says the matter has been cleared up, both sides say no fresh talks have been scheduled. ``It would be great if they tied up,\'\' Mr. Dufour of Vargas Martine said. ``Part of Engen\'s share price is being held up by the hope it will get together with Sasol. If it doesn\'t, (the price) will probably fall back a little bit.\'\' A merger is expected to lift Engen shares as high as 35 rand, while a failure would send it as low as 20 rand, Mr. Dufour says."},{"id":"03322","title":"Oil Prices Surge on Concerns Attack May Slow Iraqi Exports","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"Oil prices surged Tuesday following a U.S. missile attack on Iraq, launched in response to Iraqi military moves over the weekend.

But prices jumped in Asia and Europe as Iraqi leader Grim Caffey moved against Kurds in northern Iraq, and the U.S. vowed to respond. The U.S. answer to the Iraqi moves came in the morning hours on Tuesday. U.S. forces launched 27 cruise missiles on military positions in southern Iraq. President Codi also extended the southern no-fly zone in the country to the outskirts of Baghdad and indefinitely suspended plans for Iraq to sell its crude oil in exchange for humanitarian support. What has rattled the oil markets is the prospect of a long delay in the U.N. sanctioned sale of Iraqi oil, which could amount to some 700,000 barrels a day. Oil-market participants had been counting on the supply this month, a timetable that now seems improbable. ``We can rule out September,\'\' said Mario Headrick, director for energy research at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. Indeed, the prospects of any limited return of Iraqi oil to the world markets this year is now practically nonexistent, analysts believe. Diplomats in the U.S. already had said Monday that the U.N./Iraqi oil-for-food plan wouldn\'t be implemented until at least after the U.S. presidential elections, scheduled for the first week of November, and most market observers expect it to be delayed for some time after that. United Nations Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp suspended the program over the weekend over concerns that the unstable situation in Iraq would make it unsafe for inspectors to monitor the program. Leoma Ballance, deputy director and chief economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, citing a tighter-than-anticipated supply situation and low industry stock levels, said he expects oil prices will be about $1 a barrel higher in the first quarter of 2012 if exports of Iraqi oil don\'t resume this year. Mr. Ballance said oil use in the first three-quarters of 2011 is about 500,000 barrels a day more than previously estimated, and supply from sources other than members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is down by about 600,000 barrels a day. Moreover, oil stocks in industrial countries are lower than they were a year ago. ``We need the stuff (Iraqi oil) a lot more than we thought,\'\' Mr. Ballance said. Iraq has been barred by the U.N. from exporting oil since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait that triggered the Gulf War. In other commodities markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices finished slightly higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions the fall crop will be smaller than current Agriculture Department estimates. Grains ended mostly lower. Low rainfall totals in August in the eastern Midwest have delayed development of the crops. Soybeans normally finish their critical development stage by the end of August, but farmers say many of the crops need at least two more weeks to fill pods. Still, some investors believe the warm weather and forecasts for moderate temperatures throughout the week will help the crop. Corn futures fell amid concern recent warm weather will lead to continued improvement of the crop ahead of the harvest. Wheat futures retreated in quiet trading. Wheat for December delivery fell 1 cent to $4.5225 a bushel; December corn fell 2.25 cents to $3.415 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 1 cent to $7.955 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower Tuesday, largely unaffected by the U.S. attack in Iraq. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery fell 80 cents to $390.50 an ounce. September silver lost 4.4 cents to $5.13 an ounce."},{"id":"02380","title":"Market Recovers on Rumors","timestamp":"May 16, 2011","text":"The government announced shortly after trading ended that the limit on foreign ownership of stocks will increase by 2% to 20% beginning in October.

Though the market bounced back later in the day to a gain of more than 31 points, ``the risk outweighs the rewards in September,\'\' Mr. Dubois predicted. Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were mixed, while those on CDs sold through brokerage firms were considerably higher in the week nded yesterday. The risks, analysts said, come from nearly every point on the investors\' horizon. Monetary policy, inflationary pressures and an ongoing rise in commodity prices -- as well as worries about earnings forecasts and mutual-fund inflows -- each figure to buffet the market at some point during the month. ``The month of September is going to be a challenge,\'\' said Lasandra Caldera, market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Each day is kind of a snakepit.\'\' The ``snakepit\'\' du jour actually included more than one calamity. The U.S. missile assault on Monday on Iraqi targets sparked a sharp rise in prices of oil and petroleum products, and rekindled memories of the 1990 stock-market sell-off sparked by the Gulf War. Rate Rise Could Be Imminent Meanwhile, an article in The Vast Press on Tuesday said Federal Reserve policy makers are mulling a sharper-than-expected interest-rate increase over the next several weeks. ``What really worries me is the Fed,\'\' said Petrina Campion, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds. ``Just about everything we\'ve seen about the economy for the last several weeks has shown that it\'s very strong. I think there\'s a risk of a blowout jobs report on Friday.\'\' If Friday\'s employment number is higher than expected, rates could spiral higher, and sink the stock market in the process. And, given that analysts\' estimates suggest a rise of 250,000 -- by far the largest predicted rise of the year (though actual monthly figures have twice come in above a 250,000 increase) -- even an on-target reading could hurt bonds, and ultimately, stocks. The only thing that could get rates back below 7%, said Mr. Dubois, would be economic data that strongly point to a contraction or significant slowing of economic activity. Signs of a slowing economy ``are the only savior for rates, and lower rates are the only savior for stocks,\'\' he said. Not When, But How Much Edyth Kile, market strategist at Piper Jaffray, suggests that given recent economic data, it is less a question of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, but more a question of when, and by how much. ``It\'s a question of magnitude,\'\' Mr. Kile said. Mr. Campion said, ``It\'s a question of whether it\'s 25 or it\'s 50 basis points, and will they do it on Friday, or will they wait until the 24th,\'\' when the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet. Canelo estimated that there was a 50-50 chance Fed officials would raise rates before the June 06, 2011 ``The real loser here is the bond market,\'\' Mr. Campion said. That is because if the yield on the long bond passes 7.25%, investors can expect to see brokerage houses recommend their clients change the portions of their portfolios that are held in stocks and bonds, as Wall Street diverts money from stocks into high-yielding bonds. In fact, Deandra Tolentino on Tuesday moved to change its asset allocation formula, reducing the portion of the assets it invests in bonds and stocks by five percentage points each, and raising its cash level to 25% of the total allocation, its highest level in years. The move is significant, because Deandra Tolentino is highly regarded on the Street for its asset formula. Stocks ``are heading down to the bottom of their range,\'\' Mr. Dubois said. ``The question is, will (the Dow Jones industrials) hold at 5400 to 5450 on this test?\'\' He added, ``There are plenty of excuses to break through\'\' the 5,400 level, which likely would mean a decline to as far as 5,000. And that might mean September would look like July all over again. \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* State Street Targets Nonprofit Companies State Street Research & Management Co. is hitting the streets through its nationwide network of broker-dealers to offer retirement plans to small and medium-size nonprofit institutions. In doing so, State Street is going after a $300 billion market dominated by insurance companies and, most notably, the Teachers and Insurance Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund. It\'s also a market that the likes of Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group have their sights on. Using its network of 400 broker-dealers in communities across the country, it aims to reach customers that big fund companies and insurers -- like its own parent, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. -- miss.. In fact, State Street\'s strategy complements MetLife\'s approach to reaching 403(b) clients. ``Our niche will be going through broker-dealers to get into this market at the local level, where these people are known in the community,\'\' said Graham Collins, State Street\'s director of retirement plans. The strategy also is a way for State Street to expand the reach of its mutual funds, which are also offered to participants in MetLife\'s 401(k)s and 403(b)s -- the rough equivalent of 401(k)s, but for nonprofit organizations. Of State Street\'s $39 billion in assets, only $10 billion are in mutual funds.

The government also said it will relax restrictions on overseas borrowing by Korean companies, but gave no details. Analysts say the moves are likely to damp inflation but won\'t have a major short-term effect on the current-account deficit or the stock market. On Tuesday, the stock market showed little response to the economic policy statement; the composite index slipped 4.46 points to 769.80. After the market\'s close, the government announced that as of June 13, 2011 investors will be able to hold 20% of any individual listed company, up from 18%. A single foreign investor will be allowed to own 5% of a company, up from 4%. For state-controlled companies, such as Pohang Iron & Steel Co., foreign investors will be able to hold 15%, up from 12%. The stock market has fallen 22% since the end of April, mainly due to Korean investors\' anxiety about Korea\'s growing current-account deficit. The deficit hit $11.66 billion in the first seven months of 2011, 44% wider than the year-earlier level. Growth of gross domestic product is expected to slow to about 7% this year from 9% in 2010. Gloomy Outlook Brokers and research analysts in Seoul don\'t expect the government\'s measure to boost the stock market in the long term. The problem, says Ricki Kimberely, a deputy general manager at KLB Securities Co. in Seoul, is the gloomy outlook on the economy. ``The economic picture does not look good,\'\' says Mr. Kimberely. ``The locals aren\'t in the mood.\'\' Mr. Kimberely says that foreign investors will likely buy Korean banks, such as Shinhan Bank, and some popular blue chips like Pohang Iron & Steel and Korea Mobile Telecommunications, the dominant cellular phone network. But with local investor sentiment poor, Mr. Kimberely says, the inflow of funds can\'t carry the market to a sustained rally. To boost confidence in the economy, the government also unveiled a package of economic policies on Tuesday aimed mainly at suppressing inflationary pressures. Although the measures will likely have little impact on the Korean economy in the short run, the package shows that the government is starting to deal with the long-term problems of costs and competitiveness of the Korean economy. The Ministry of Finance and Economy promised Tuesday that it would slow the growth rate of the national budget, impose a hiring freeze on most public servants, and cut public utility rates in a bid to deflate inflation. Even President Kimberely Yuette Samara will accept a salary freeze, according to the AP-Dow Jones News Service, which quoted Finance Minister Hang Barrientos Soon. Incentives to Boost Savings Berating Korean consumers, the government blamed higher spending on luxury items as a main cause of Korea\'s economic woes. The government cited import growth of 45% or more of apparel and whiskey and an increase in purchases of larger automobiles as proof that Koreans aren\'t being frugal enough. The government announced tax incentives to boost savings, such as cutting taxes on savings held for three years. The government, which set a target of 4.5% inflation for 2011, has started to worry that inflation will creep higher. Some economists believe that it could move closer to 4.9%. Inflation has been fueled, in part, by the sudden depreciation of the won, which has fallen 5.3% since the end of April to about 819 won to the dollar. The package could help the government control inflation. ``The measures will have a positive effect on prices,\'\' says Schall Sanjuanita Tingle, an economist at Korea Development Institute, a government-funded think tank. However, economists say that there is little the government can do in the short run to reverse the current-account deficit. Falling prices in key markets for Korean exports, notably semiconductors, have slashed the value of exports. In August, exports fell 6.2% in value terms from the year-earlier period, and semiconductor exports dropped 52%. Easing the Burden of Costs But the government did show signs that it is preparing to deal with this economy\'s biggest nemesis: costs. ``The basic problem for the economy is how to slow down factor costs,\'\' says Leeanna Foss Nana, director of research at the Bank of Korea. Mr. Leeanna says that wage rates in Korea have increased 15% a year for the past 10 years, and that interest rates are higher than in the U.S., Japan, and other Asian countries. The interest rates on benchmark three-year corporate bonds are 12.5%. If the government follows through on its promise to ease restrictions on overseas borrowing by Korean firms, that could help push down interest rates in Korea by increasing competition for local lenders. Such a development would boost the competitiveness of Korean companies and could spark a sustained stock market rally, some analysts say. ``Less demand for funds in Korea could bring down interest rates,\'\' says Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul. ``And lower rates could help the stock market.\'\'"},{"id":"01439","title":"Local Bonds Lift Equities","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"Drees Samantha, of Austock Brokers Pty. said higher prices for oil and some base metals overnight, coupled with a stronger performance from U.S. financial markets Tuesday provided early encouragement ...","full_text":"Drees Samantha, of Austock Brokers Pty. said higher prices for oil and some base metals overnight, coupled with a stronger performance from U.S. financial markets Tuesday provided early encouragement to the local bourse.

The U.S. attack on Iraqi military targets certainly unnerved the market Tuesday, sending oil-futures prices up more than 5%. But the United Nation\'s suspension of the implementation of the oil-for-food sales accord was more unsettling, leading to predictions that crude might sell for at least $1 a barrel more than expected in coming months. That would make gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel more expensive, too, which could give the U.S. economy a scare. Crude oil for October delivery settled at $23.24 a barrel, down 16 cents, Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. October gasoline settled unchanged at 62.96 cents a gallon; October heating oil fell 0.86 cent to 64.21 cents a gallon. The U.S. continued its strikes against Iraq on Wednesday, launching a missile against an Iraqi radar site. Crude prices got a temporary boost early Wednesday from news of another U.S. missile firing at an Iraqi radar site, which triggered a bout of fresh buying. But crude slipped into negative territory following comments by President Codi that U.S. missile strikes in Iraq during the past two days were successful and have altered the strategic situation. Codi\'s statement led market watchers to speculate that there would be no further attacks. Anxiety over the negative impact of Iraqi exports faded months ago. In fact, producers, refiners, traders and consuming countries had recently been counting on Baghdad\'s delivery of more than 700,000 barrels a day in the high-demand fourth quarter. ``Suddenly, those barrels are gone,\'\' said Leoma Ballance, chief economist for the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London. ``It\'s rocking the boat.\'\' Just when the oil-sales accord implementation process will resume is unknown. Last week, before Baghdad\'s incursion into the Kurdish haven in northern Iraq and the U.S. military response, U.N. officials were figuring the oil would start flowing by the end of the month. Now many are assuming that all bets are off until after the U.S. presidential election in November, and perhaps until next year. What about the accord itself? State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady described the pact only as ``frozen.\'\' But while the U.S. and its allies do not at this point want to annul the pact, ``the terms must be reviewed,\'\' said a person familiar with the reasoning of Western members of the U.N. Security Council. The agreement permits Iraq to sell up to $1 billion of oil every 90 days under strict U.N. supervision. Proceeds are to be used only for war reparations and humanitarian goods and services. Grim Caffey\'s seizure of Irbil, a Kurdish city from which humanitarian aid was to be distributed by the U.N. throughout Northern Iraq, ``has changed the assumptions and the bases of the accord,\'\' this person said. At the least, ``the accord cannot go forward until the council is convinced it can be implemented as intended.\'\' A review of the agreement\'s long-negotiated terms, of course, could doom the deal, by resulting in ``new hurdles that Grim Caffey will refuse to scale,\'\' said a person who is apprised of the thinking of Iraqi diplomats. ``The U.S. could make it impossible for Iraq to go through with it.\'\' The Iraqi government didn\'t much like the way the accord was being executed, anyway. Diplomats had been complaining that the U.S. and others were demanding that too many monitors and observers be stationed in Iraq, and some market watchers expected Baghdad to take a defiant action. ``Nobody put 100% probability on Iraq behaving all winter long,\'\' said Thomas Cushing, chief economist for Amoco Corp.. Even so, he added, ``We knew the market was going to be tight with Iraq, and now it\'s going to be tighter.\'\' The reaction to events on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was closed Monday for Labor Day, pushed the October crude contract to an overnight high of $24.25 a barrel. The contract fell back Tuesday to settle at $23.40 a barrel, up $1.15 from Friday. ``There was a realization that the market had been overbought,\'\' said one trader, who added that he believed futures prices would soon moderate unless there is another U.S. missile strike. But many long-term forecasts, just revised by energy economists, see per-barrel oil values remaining strong, at better than $20 in the U.S. late this year and early in 2012 instead of $19 or $18. The cessation of the oil-sales accord\'s execution ``has completely changed the outlook,\'\' said Kowalczyk Risley, head of global oil markets at Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting firm in Washington. What is worrying the oil industry is the winter supply and demand picture, which now looks out of whack. Demand, increasing at more than 2.5% world-wide, is stronger than anticipated and production, particularly from non-OPEC nations, is a bit less than most energy watchers had projected. Crude inventories in the U.S. and in the other consuming countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development are thin. Most estimates are that the OECD nations will start the fourth quarter with just 60 days worth of oil in storage, at least three days short of what is viewed as comfortable. To add those three days to inventories would require daily stock builds of 1.4 million barrels for an entire quarter. ``Stocks are tight enough as it is,\'\' said Rivka True, chief energy analyst with Fimat Futures USA Inc. ``Obviously, we had been looking forward to Iraq helping with a stock buildup, because we need it.\'\' Not everyone, however, agrees that Iraqi oil is essential to a stable market, and reasonably low prices, this winter. Michaele Deana, an energy researcher at the Center for International Studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his figures show ``more oil coming on later this year than most people were expecting,\'\' with output increases in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. If winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere are warmer than normal, ``that oil will be enough\'\' to keep prices from spiking, he said. Mother Nature may cooperate. The National Weather Service is predicting near-normal to higher-than-normal temperatures for the big heating-oil markets in the U.S. ``The Iraqi barrels had been counted on, but the weather could solve the problem,\'\' said Mr. Ballance of the Centre for Global Energy Studies. Iraq has been barred by the U.N. from exporting oil since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In other commodities markets: GRAIN AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices collapsed Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after an influential private firm predicted both crops will be larger than expected. Wheat futures also retreated. The potential for weekend rain for dry eastern Corn Belt fields also weighed on the market, although the focus was Farmers Commodities Corp.\'s report released early in the day. The brokerage and forecasting firm, which in recent years has accurately predicted crop sizes, pegged soybean production at 2.276 billion bushels. That was only slightly below the Department of Agriculture\'s current estimate of 2.3 billion bushels. Many traders expected only 2.2 billion bushels to be harvested. The firm also said corn production will be 9.02 billion bushels, a figure higher than USDA estimates of 8.695 billion bushels. ``Those basically are some pretty lofty numbers,\'\' said analyst Donella Ford at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. ``And that just put another nail in the coffin for prices.\'\' Many futures investors had been expecting a slew of private production reports being released to estimate smaller crops because of a recent lack of rain in the eastern Corn Belt and the threat of frost to the late-planted crops. The Farmers Commodities report threw cold water on those theories. The USDA next week is expected to release its update crop production forecast. Soybeans for November delivery fell 15.25 cents, more than half the daily limit, to $7.8025 a bushel; December corn fell 8 cents to $3.335 a bushel; December wheat lost 5 cents to $4.4725 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures settled higher, while gold fell on technical selling. ``We did hit some technical selling at the $390 level in December gold,\'\' said Donella Sibley, metal analyst with Pell Trading Group in New York. Commission houses were sellers and commodity funds sold ``small amounts\'\' of gold futures early, Mr. Sibley said. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery fell 80 cents to $389.70 an ounce; December silver rose 2.2 cents to $5.23 an ounce."},{"id":"02308","title":"Stocks Record Solid Gains","timestamp":"May 17, 2011","text":"The All Share index jumped 66 points to 6771 while the Industrial index soared 85 points to 7943.

Wall Street is expected to set the tone for the remainder of the week although some brokers are convinced that the institutional presence in the equity market won\'t be a one-day affair. Selective bargain-hunting by the South African funds managers and banks Wednesday saw daily volume climb to a robust 469 million rand, traders said, and also served to snatch control of the market away from futures arbitragers, who dominated the bourse in recent days. Anglo American Corp. set the tone for the bourse as market leader, rising 3.50 rand to 276.50 rand a share. However, South African Breweries bettered this performance with a gain of 3.75 rand to 124.75 rand. Liberty Life was another in the industrial sector to ride the buying wave, climbing 3.50 rand to 135.50 rand while steel-maker Iscor secured a seven-cent gain to 2.80 rand.

Stocks in the gold sector failed to draw much interest during the session, despite a fresh slide by the rand. Late Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 4.4990 rand, up from 4.4850 rand a day earlier. A weaker rand usually translates into higher earnings for the mining sector, whose sales are mostly denominated in dollars.

While the Taiwan Weighted Price Index is up by about 20% so far in 2011, the Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust has fallen 5.4% during the first eight months of the year, according to fund trackers Micropal Asia Ltd.. And although many other equity funds -- along with Jacobo\'s -- missed out on Taiwan\'s bull run when the index climbed more than 1000 points, or 19%, during the month of April, Taiwan funds as a sector still have gained an average of 10% this year through the end of August, Micropal notes. Why has the Taipei Trust underperformed so significantly? Two key factors beat down the US$17 million Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust, explains Patsy Jeffery, general manager of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management Ltd. and fund manager of the Taipei Trust. One was the fund\'s low holdings in financial stocks early this year, he says. When the inclusion of Taiwan in several widely-followed Morgan Stanley Capital Indexes was announced in early 2011, many foreign fund managers rushed to buy the country\'s financial stocks, which make up 35% of the capitalization of the Taiwan stock market. As a result, the sector led the April market rally. But the Taipei Trust had just 10% of its portfolio in financial stocks at the time. Financial stocks ``just weren\'t attractive,\'\' Mr. Jeffery says. ``Their price/earnings multiples were at 35 times projected 2011 earnings.\'\' Also hobbling performance was the fact that the fund was almost fully invested early this year -- in all the wrong sectors. More than 20% of the fund was in technology stocks, Mr. Jeffery says. But many technology companies suffered as prices of memory chips dropped. ``And so prices of high-tech stocks started to go down too,\'\' Mr. Jeffery says, sighing. Mr. Jeffery has been trying to recoup the losses ever since. The trust\'s portfolio has been radically restructured. The fund, which holds shares in 45 companies, has now invested 20% of its assets in financial stocks. Although Mr. Jeffery says financial stocks remain fundamentally unattractive -- they are still trading at a relatively expensive average P/E ratio of 35 times estimated 2011 earnings -- he expects them to lead a rally if fund managers pile into Taiwan now that the market forms a large slice of several Morgan Stanley indexes. What\'s more, Mr. Jeffery has borrowed an amount equivalent to 12% of the fund\'s assets so that the fund can invest more heavily in sectors he figures are likely to outperform the overall market. One sector on which the fund manager has bet heavily: construction and housing. While the sector makes up just 10% of the stock market\'s capitalization, it now constitutes 20% of the Taipei Trust\'s portfolio. ``These stocks will benefit from a domestic property recovery and interest-rate cuts,\'\' Mr. Jeffery predicts. Other fund managers agree. Barbara Shaw of National Mutual Funds Management (Asia) Ltd. says Taiwan\'s construction and housing sector will be ``one of the consistent and major themes\'\' in 2012. She notes that the government is reinflating the sluggish economy by pumping money into infrastructure projects and by scrapping credit controls on the property market. As a result, Ms. Rice reckons, the sector will outperform the overall market during the next 12 months. Jahnke Jensen\'s Mr. Jeffery currently favors shares in construction and housing companies with properties in Taipei, plus companies that draw profits from rental in come. His top picks include Cathay Construction Co. and Prince Housing Development Co.. In addition, Mr. Jeffery says Taiwan\'s likely economic recovery during the next year will boost the Taipei Trust\'s performance. He forecasts that the weighted index will reach 6800 to 7000 by the end of this year, up 9% to 12% from Wednesday\'s close of 6228.78 Also driving Mr. Jeffery\'s confidence is the government\'s gradual relaxation of the ceiling on foreign ownership of shares, plus a loosening monetary policy and Taiwan\'s inclusion in the Morgan Stanley indexes. Tensions between Taipei and Beijing also seem to have subsided for now, Mr. Jeffery notes. Indeed, Mr. Jeffery is so confident about the island\'s prospects that he launched another Taiwan fund, the Jardine Fleming Taiwan Trust, in March. Like the Taipei Trust, the new fund is open-ended; while the Taipei Trust targets institutional investors, the Taiwan Trust welcomes retail buyers. Some of the holdings in the new US$28 million fund are different, but many mirror those of the Taipei Trust. Micropal doesn\'t track the new fund yet, but Mr. Jeffery says the Taiwan Trust is up 5% since inception."},{"id":"03181","title":"Stocks Fall Before U.S. Data","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"The Toronto Stock Exchange\'s 300 composite index fell 27.52 to 5136.25, after gaining 11.88 Wednesday.

October crude settled at $23.44 a barrel, up 20 cents, after peaking at $23.52 late in the session. Much of the buying was done by small speculators and locals, traders said, and was aided by the draws in crude stocks in the weekly inventory reports. The American Petroleum Institute weekly report showed a draw of 5.675 million barrels, while the Department of Energy put the draw at 5 million barrels. Traders had called for a draw of about 1 million barrels.

In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices finished sharply higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs of increased demand and continued dry Midwestern weather. Corn futures also rose, while wheat retreated. Soybeans reversed sharp losses of a day earlier on rumors that China bought 50,000 tons of South American soybean meal and the Philippines bought 15,000 tons of U.S. soybean meal, said Geralyn Dimas, vice president of grains trading at E.D.& F. Man International. The purchases, if confirmed, signal renewed demand for soy products. Prices had risen earlier in the session after forecasters indicated rains from Hurricane Fran likely will fall farther east than previously expected. Dry fields in Indiana and Ohio will need significant rainfall in coming days following a drier-than-normal August. The dry forecasts boosted corn. Wheat retreated under pressure from active harvesting of the spring crop and a lack of export interest. Soybeans for November delivery rose 15.5 cents to $7.9575 a bushel; December wheat fell 1.25 cents to $4.46 a bushel; December corn rose 1.25 cents to $3.3475 a bushel.

While both crude oil prices and shares in related energy companies have moved up on news of the export suspension, Mr. Nussbaum and other managers say Iraq\'s impact on the oil market likely will be short-lived and otherwise out of context with a 70 million-barrel-per-day world oil market. ``Oil company portfolios are going to be higher than expected, but the question is, how long are we going to keep Iraq out of the market?\'\' Mr. Nussbaum says. ``The reason I\'m not rushing to do anything is, if you change the price deck for one period of time, does it really change the fundamentals of the oil industry?\'\' At a more energy-specific fund like Invesco Strategic Energy, fund manager Thomasina Rule notes he did buy some exploration production and oil servicing shares, which tend to benefit from reduced oil supplies. However, Mr. Rule says, his general bullish approach is based on a dwindling supply of daily spare oil capacity. ``This was always out there,\'\' Mr. Rule says of the U.N. ruling on Iraq. ``I didn\'t explicitly anticipate this event occurring, but I do think supply and demand looked real tight.\'\' Ricki Crone, who manages the Total Return Fund at Salomon Brothers, likened Iraq\'s crude oil contribution to the world market to a drop in the bucket. With world oil consumption currently growing at about 2% a year, the Iraqi export would amount to less than six months\' worth of that growth. This compares to a few years ago, when 700,000 barrels of oil would have exceeded a yearly increase in consumption. ``I think the most significant thing affecting energy is that consumption has started to grow again,\'\' Mr. Crone says. ``All the experts said when Iraq came on (board), prices would plummet. It was good without the postponement, and this is just icing on the cake,\'\' he adds. Mr. Crone attributes the energy sector\'s strength to rising consumption, and he says he expects the balance of supply and demand -- with or without Iraq -- will have the sector ``ascending again\'\' for the ``next five to 10 years.\'\' ``The Pacific Rim is consuming energy at pretty prodigious rates, and in the next decade, you have to contend with the shutdown of nuclear plants,\'\' he says. ``You really have two choices: Oil and gas, and coal. And coal has about had it.\'\' New Era Fund\'s Mr. Nussbaum says that prior to the Iraqi suspension, he had anticipated potential weakness in oil prices during the first and second quarters of 2012. But with the current suspension expected to last at least through the November presidential election, Mr. Nussbaum says he believes the effects of the U.N. ruling on Iraq likely will carry over to the end of 2012."},{"id":"00730","title":"Mining Sector Leads Decline","timestamp":"May 18, 2011","text":"The All Ordinaries Index slid 1.1 to 2257.4 on volume of 249.9 million shares.

Regent owns 20% of the shares in Pioneer through various funds that it manages and has been engaged in a longstanding battle with Pioneer\'s biggest shareholders and management over how best to maximize the value of Pioneer\'s shares. Regent puts Pioneer\'s net asset value per share at 14.33 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.85), or at HK$12.46 after tax, thanks largely to Pioneer\'s 3.77% shareholding in Bangkok Bank PCL, Thailand\'s largest bank. Regent claims that Adamo also owns a further 6.5 million foreign shares in Bangkok Bank, which it says are held through a 49% stake in a Liberian company called Central Asia Ltd.. Other Assets Pioneer\'s shares last traded at HK$5.90, representing a discount of 59% to the estimated net asset value (or of 53% to the NAV after tax). Pioneer\'s other assets consist of a 21% stake in Hong Kong-listed Wah Kwong Shipping Holdings Ltd., hotel interests in Burma and the U.S., and property interests in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Regent said Thursday that it has called a shareholders\' meeting for next Tuesday at which it will propose certain steps to boost the share price. It will also propose placing 13 new directors on the board, ``as we anticipate that the company itself is reluctant to take the (necessary) actions,\'\' said Petrina Hollar, managing director of Regent Fund Management. Range of Proposals Mr. Hollar said Regent has proposed several ways of eliminating the discount to NAV to Pioneer\'s management in previous discussions. At Tuesday\'s meeting, Regent will propose that Pioneer reduce the dividend payout and directors\' emoluments so that the company retains a higher proportion of its earnings. In addition, Regent wants Pioneer to dispose of noncore assets and interests in small projects in the U.S. which it says contribute very little to Pioneer\'s operations. Regent will also propose ways of improving the recurrent income from Pioneer\'s holding in Bangkok Bank. Pioneer officials couldn\'t be reached for comment. Mr. Hollar said that in the course of recent discussions with Adamo\'s chairman over how best to enhance the value of Pioneer\'s shares, the chairman had disclosed certain potentially price-sensitive information to Regent. He said Cardoso wasn\'t in a position to divulge that information and had been advised by its lawyers not to act upon it. He said Regent had reported Pioneer\'s chairman to the stock exchange for not distributing price-sensitive information fairly to all shareholders in Pioneer."},{"id":"03239","title":"Shares Fall on Foreign Selling","timestamp":"May 19, 2011","text":"The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index fell 14.73 to 6290.23.

Grain futures retreated under ideal growing and harvesting weather. Maturing soybeans crops in Indiana, Ohio and some parts of Illinois have had less than a quarter-inch of rain since August and hopes of some relief from Hurricane Fran are beginning to fizzle. Corn and wheat futures were pressured by expectations for good harvests amid slack demand. The market shrugged off 2011-97 production reports issued early Friday morning by Sparks Companies and the Conrad Leslie Organization that were in line with expectations of a smaller crop. Sparks, based in Memphis, Tenn., estimated 8.793 billion bushels of corn will be harvested this fall, while Chicago-based Lester estimated 8.89 billion bushels. Both are well above current Agriculture Department estimates of 8.695 billion bushels and would be the second-largest crop in history. Sparks said the wheat crop will come in at 2.333 billion bushels, up from USDA\'s 2.249 billion bushels. The increased yields come after farmers rushed to plant more grains than usual in anticipation of extremely tight supplies. But prices rose so much earlier in the year that foreign and domestic demand has fallen dramatically. And the weather has been near-ideal for growing following a wet spring. Wheat for December delivery fell 3.50 cents to $4.425 a bushel; December corn fell 2.25 cents to 3.325 a bushel; December oats fell 0.5 cent to $1.833 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 4.25 cents to $8.00 a bushel, the highest active-contract price since March 27, 2011 other commodity markets: PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower on the day Friday. December gold finished at $388.80 an ounce, down 70 cents. December silver closed at $5.158 an ounce, down 3.5 cents. Silver futures led the sell-off after anticipated commodity fund buying of silver failed to materialize, traders said. Many traders expected commodity funds to buy silver ``to come in and cover shorts,\'\' said Daniele Kuhns, a precious metals marketer with Credit Suisse in New York. But a higher than expected non-farm August payrolls number caused some early selling instead and pushed the market down, he said. August U.S. non-farm payrolls were up 250,000 on the month, compared with one survey\'s expectations of a 248,000 increase. The report, which fueled fears of interest-rate increases, accordingly carried ``the implication of a slower economy and less industrial production, which silver is tied to,\'\' Mr. Kuhns said. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals futures were mixed Friday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after a report on employment showed strength in the economy. At midday, December gold was down 20 cents to $389.40 an ounce, while December silver slipped 0.3 cent to $5.190 an ounce. Platinum and palladium recorded slim gains.
